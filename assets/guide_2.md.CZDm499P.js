He was a proponent of Russian nationalism, an important figure in the creation of a feeling of national identity and purpose. After the Crimean War (1856) and the Polish insurrection of 1863, Katkov abandoned his liberal Anglophile views and rejected the early reforms of tsar Alexander II. Instead he promoted a strong Russian state supported by an enthusiastic Russian people with a unified national outlook. His ideas were based on Western ideas (as opposed to Slavophile ideas). His literary magazine Russkii Vestnik (:The Russian Messenger\\") and newspaper Moskovskie Vedomosti (\\"Moscow News\\") were successful and influential media for promoting his views.Andreas Renner, \\"Defining a Russian nation: Mikhail Katkov and the'invention'of national politics.\\" Slavonic and East European Review (2003) 81#4: 659-682. in JSTORMartin Katz, Mikhail N. Katkov: A Political Biography, 1818-1887 (1966). == Life and work == Katkov was born of a Russian government official and a Georgian noblewoman (Tulayeva). On finishing his course at the Moscow University, Katkov devoted himself to literature and philosophy. He showed so little individuality that during the reign of Nicholas I, he never came into disagreeable contact with the authorities. With the liberal reaction and strong reform movement that characterised the earlier years of Alexander II's reign (1855-1881) that he thoroughly sympathised, and for some time, he warmly advocated the introduction of liberal institutions of the British type, but when he perceived that the agitation was assuming a socialistic and nihilist tinge, and in some quarters of the liberal camp, indulgence was being shown to Polish national aspirations, he gradually modified his attitude until he came to be regarded by the Russian liberals as a renegade. At the beginning of 1863, he assumed the management and editorship of the Moscow News, and he retained that position until his death in 1887. In the first year of his editorship, Moscow News had a circulation of 6000. By 1866, the circulation had risen to 12000. During the 24 years of editorship, he exercised considerable influence on public opinion and even on the government, by representing with great ability the moderately conservative spirit of Moscow in opposition to the occasionally ultraliberal and always cosmopolitan spirit of St Petersburg. With the Slavophiles, he agreed in advocating the extension of Russian influence in the Balkans, but he carefully kept aloof from them and condemned their sentimentality. During the Trial of the 193, between 1877 and 1878, in which universities students were charged with treason for protesting in favor of a national constitution, Katkov sided with Konstantin Pobedonostsev in urging on Alexander III to heavier punishments and more a reactionary, conservative tone. Though generally temperate in his views, he was extremely incisive and often violent in his modes of expressing them so he made many enemies and sometimes incurred the displeasure of the press censure and the ministers, against which he was more than once protected by Alexander III in consideration of his able advocacy of national interests. He is remembered chiefly as an energetic opponent of Polish national aspirations, of liberalism, of the system of public instruction based on natural science, and of German political influence. In the last capacity, he helped to prepare the way for the Franco-Russian Alliance. After Katkov's death, his place at the helm of the Conservatives was taken by Konstantin Pobedonostsev and Aleksey Suvorin. ==References== * Category:1818 births Category:1887 deaths Category:People from Moscow Category:People from Moscow Governorate Category:Russian people of Georgian descent Category:Imperial Russian politicians Category:Imperial Russian journalists Category:Imperial Russian male writers Category:19th-century journalists Category:Russian male journalists Category:19th-century Russian male writers ","title":"Mikhail Katkov"},{"id":"1434003","text":"Mandhardevi Kalubai temple is near Wai (Satara District, Maharashtra, India).

The diocese covers most of Dorset (excepting the deaneries of Bournemouth and Christchurch, which fall within the Diocese of Winchester), and most of Wiltshire (excepting a part in the north and Swindon). The diocese is led by the Bishop of Salisbury (Nick Holtam) and the diocesan synod. The bishop's seat is at Salisbury Cathedral. ==History== ===Roman Catholic=== The Diocese of Sherborne (founded ) was the origin of the present diocese; St Aldhelm was its first Bishop of Sherborne. The Diocese of Ramsbury was created from the northwestern territory of the Bishop of Winchester in 909. Herman of Wilton was appointed bishop of Ramsbury, covering Wiltshire and Berkshire, by Edward the Confessor in 1045. In or after 1059 he was also appointed Sherborne, covering Dorset, uniting the two dioceses. In 1075 he obtained approval to move the see to Old Sarum. Disputes between the bishops Herbert and Richard Poore and the sheriffs of Wiltshire led to the removal of the see in the 1220s to a new site on Salisbury Plain. This was chartered as the city of New Sarum by in 1227,Easton, James.

The diocese, like the city it administers, is now known as Salisbury. The archdeaconry around Salisbury, however, retains the name of Sarum. ===Anglican=== Reforms within the Church of England led to the annexation of Dorset from the abolished diocese of Bristol in 1836; Berkshire, however, was removed the same year and given to Oxford. In 1925 and 1974, new suffragan bishops were appointed to assist the Bishop of Salisbury; the new offices were titled the bishops of Sherborne and Ramsbury, respectively.The Diocese of Salisbury. \\"The History of the Diocese\\" .

Until 2009Salisbury Diocesan Synod minutes ‚Äì 99th session, 7 November 2009 p. 3 (Accessed 23 April 2014) the bishops operated under an episcopal area scheme established in 1981, with each suffragan bishop having a formal geographical area of responsibility, and being known as \\"area bishops\\". The Bishop of Ramsbury had oversight of the diocese's parishes in Wiltshire, while the Bishop of Sherborne had oversight of the diocese's parishes in Dorset. This scheme was replaced to reflect the increased working across the whole diocese by all three bishops. The two suffragans may now legally function anywhere in the diocese, and the Bishop of Salisbury may delegate any of his functions to them. The diocese is also divided into four archdeaconries, two for each county. These are further subdivided into deaneries and parishes. ==Bishops== The diocesan Bishop of Salisbury is assisted across the diocese by two suffragans ‚Äì the Bishop of Sherborne and the Bishop of Ramsbury. The provincial episcopal visitor (since 2013, for traditional Anglo Catholic parishes in this diocese, who have petitioned for alternative episcopal oversight) is Jonathan Goodall, Bishop suffragan of Ebbsfleet. Salisbury is one of the few dioceses not to license the PEV as an honorary assistant bishop. There are several former bishops licensed as honorary assistant bishops in the diocese: *1988‚Äìpresent: John Cavell, retired Bishop suffragan of Southampton and Bishop to Prisons, lives in Salisbury. *2011‚Äìpresent: David Hallatt, retired area Bishop of Shrewsbury, lives in Salisbury. *Additionally, Peter Price, Bishop of Bath and Wells retired to Gillingham, Dorset in 2013; and Bill Ind, retired Bishop of Truro and Bishop suffragan of Grantham, lives in Melksham; there has been no announcement that either has been made an honorary assistant bishop. ==Archdeaconries and deaneries== There are nineteen deaneries within the diocese. *Archdeaconry of Wilts **Deanery of Bradford **Deanery of Calne **Deanery of Devizes **Deanery of Marlborough **Deanery of Pewsey *Archdeaconry of Sarum **Deanery of Alderbury **Deanery of Chalke **Deanery of Heytesbury **Deanery of Salisbury **Deanery of Stonehenge *Archdeaconry of Dorset **Deanery of Milton and Blandford **Deanery of Poole **Deanery of Purbeck **Deanery of Wimborne *Archdeaconry of Sherborne **Deanery of Blackmore Vale **Deanery of Dorchester **Deanery of Lyme Bay **Deanery of Sherborne **Deanery of Weymouth and Portland ==Sarum Use== The Sarum Rite (more properly called Sarum Use) was a variant of the Roman Rite widely used for the ordering of Christian public worship, including the Mass and the Divine Office. It was established by Saint Osmund, Bishop of Salisbury in the 11th century and was originally the local form used in the Cathedral and Diocese of Salisbury; it later became prevalent throughout southern England and came to be used throughout most of England, Wales, Ireland and later Scotland until the reign of Queen Mary. Although abandoned after the 16th century, it was also a notable influence on the pattern of Anglican liturgy represented in the Book of Common Prayer. Occasional interest in and attempts at restoration of the liturgy by Anglicans and Roman Catholics have not produced a general revival, however. ==See also== *Bishop of Salisbury *Salisbury Cathedral ==References== *Church of England Statistics 2002 ==External links== * Salisbury ","title":"Diocese of Salisbury"},{"id":"1434024","text":"August Bach (30 August 1897 - 23 March 1966) was an East German Christian Democratic politician.

His wit and epigrams are well-known, one example being \\"Even reviewers read a Preface,\\" another being \\"History repeats itself. Historians repeat each other.\\" He also was the originator of a now-common theory on Henry James, writing that \\"The work of Henry James has always seemed divisible by a simple dynastic arrangement into three reigns: James I, James II, and the Old Pretender\\". ==Family and education== Guedalla was born in Maida Vale, London, into a secular Jewish family of Spanish origin; in later life he embraced his Jewish identity. He was educated at Rugby School and Balliol College, Oxford, where he in 1911 was the President of the Oxford Union; and was published in Oxford Poetry 1910‚Äì1913. In 1919 he married Nellie Maude Reitlinger, the daughter of a banker. They never had children. Asked how to say his name, he told The Literary Digest \\"My own pronunciation is gwuh-dal'lah. I have very little doubt that this is wholly incorrect.\\"Charles Earle Funk, What's the Name, Please?, Funk & Wagnalls, 1936 ==Career== Having been called to the Bar by the Inner Temple, Guedalla practised as a barrister from 1913 to 1923, before turning to writing. During the First World War he organised and acted as secretary to the Flax Control Board and also served as legal adviser to the Contracts Departments of the War Office and the Ministry of Munitions.The Times, 18 December 1944 p. 6 In the Second World War he served in the Royal Air Force, with the rank of Squadron Leader. He was also President of the British Zionist Federation, president of the Jewish Historical Society of England and Vice-President of the Jewish Representative Council. ==Politics== Guedalla was a parliamentary candidate for the Liberal Party five times, always unsuccessfully. He first stood for Parliament as a Liberal at the 1922 general election in Hackney North in a straight fight with the incumbent Conservative Sir Walter Greene, MP. Greene held the seat with a majority of 4,615 votes.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p. 21 At the 1923 general election Guedalla was adopted as Liberal candidate for the Derbyshire North East constituency. This looked as if it might be a winnable seat for the Liberals as at the general election of 1922 the Liberal candidate Stanley Holmes had come within 15 votes of taking the seat from Labour in a three- cornered contest. Despite the boost the Liberals had received in the run-up to the 1923 general election with the reunion of the Lloyd George and Asquithian wings of the party, Guedalla was unable to gain Derbyshire North East and fell to the foot of the poll behind the Conservatives. He tried again in Derbyshire North East at the 1924 general election but again came third behind the Tories in a three-cornered fight.F W S Craig, op cit p. 324 Guedalla next attempted to enter the House of Commons as Liberal candidate for Manchester Rusholme at the 1929 general election. This had been a Liberal seat between 1923 and 1924 having been held by Charles Masterman a former Liberal Cabinet minister. Guedalla maintained second place behind the sitting Tory MP Sir Frank Boyd Merriman but was unable to regain the seat.F W S Craig, op cit p. 192 At the 1931 general election Guedalla moved constituencies again, this time to nearby Manchester Withington. This was a Liberal seat, held between 1923‚Äì1924 and 1929-1931 by Ernest Simon. However, in the summer of 1931 an economic crisis led to the formation of a National Government led by prime minister Ramsay MacDonald supported by a small number of National Labour MPs and initially backed by the Conservative and Liberal parties. In many constituencies the main opposition party to Labour simply assumed the mantle of the Coalition government but in Manchester the Conservative and Liberal parties could not work together to agree an electoral pact, even in the unique circumstances of the national emergency.The Times, 14 October 1931 p. 6 So Guedalla found himself opposed by Edward Fleming for the Conservatives who won the seat comfortably with a majority of 14,718.F W S Craig, op cit p. 194 In 1936 he was elected to serve on the Liberal Party Council.The Liberal Magazine, 1936 ==Death== Guedalla died in hospital in London on 16 December 1944 at age 55, having contracted an illness during his service in the RAF.The Times, 18 December 1944 p. 6Associated Press, ‚ÄúEnglish Author Dies‚Äù, The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Sunday 17 December 1944, Volume 51, page 3. ==Sleuth reference== In the play Sleuth by Anthony Shaffer, mystery writer Andrew Wyke says, \\"Do you agree that the detective story is the normal recreation of noble minds?

A miter saw in its earliest form was composed of a back saw in a miter box, but in modern implementation consists of a powered circular saw that can be positioned at a variety of angles and lowered onto a board positioned against a backstop. Powered miter saws are also commonly referred to as chop saws. ==Power miter saw== A power miter saw, also known as a drop saw, is a power tool used to make a quick, accurate crosscut in a workpiece at a selected angle. It is commonly used for cutting of molding and trim. Most miter saws are relatively small and portable, with common blade sizes ranging from eight to twelve inches. The power miter saw was invented by Ed Niehaus, the Chief Engineer in the Power Tool Division for Rockwell International, in 1964. The miter saw showcased several innovations still found today: radial arc spring action, blade braking and dust collection. Rockwell did not patent the design, leading to a large number of manufacturers and innovation improvements.http://www.toolsofthetrade.net/power-tools/hall-of-fame-2002_o The power miter saw makes cuts by pulling a spinning circular saw blade down onto a workpiece in a short, controlled motion. The workpiece is typically held against a fence, which provides a precise cutting angle between the plane of the blade and the plane of the longest workpiece edge. In standard position, this angle is fixed at 90¬∞. A primary distinguishing feature of the miter saw is the miter index that allows the angle of the blade to be changed relative to the fence. While most miter saws enable precise one-degree incremental changes to the miter index, many also provide \\"stops\\" that allow the miter index to be quickly set to common angles (such as 15¬∞, 22.5¬∞, 30¬∞, and 45¬∞). ===Types=== A compound-miter saw There are several types of miter saws: * Original miter box and saw - The first miter saws usually consisted of a wooden or plastic three-sided box with 90¬∞ and 45¬∞ slits to guide a hand or back saw to make miter cuts in a piece of work. * Power/Standard miter saw - A powered version designed generally for making straight cross cuts on a piece of work at a wide range of angles (unlike an abrasive saw which can only cut 90 degrees to the board). They are commonly used to create 45¬∞ degree straight cuts for framing. * Compound-miter saw - Compound miter saws have the added benefit of being able to tilt the blade and head at a variety of angles to the workpiece. This makes bevel cuts possible. A bevel cut is a ramp angled cut into the side of the wood. This type is commonly used in trim work for homes. A compound cut is a combination of a miter and bevel cut. * Dual compound- miter saw - Dual or double compound saws allow the head to rotate when angled on both the left and right hand sides. This means all angles are achievable without repositioning the workpiece. * Sliding compound-miter saw - Sliding miter saws are able to move the saw head back and forth on a sliding rail, similar to a radial arm saw. This increases the size capacity of which a board can be cut. This type of saw can also allow for the locking of the rails to use for straight, pull down cuts (like chop saws). With the sliding feature engaged, the user pulls the head forward, turns on the saw and pushes the blade backwards into the lumber. * Laser/LED miter-saws - Some saws have a laser guide for more precise cutting. The laser is made up of a disc-shaped washer that attaches to the saw blade and illuminates a line for which where the blade will cut. Some saws also have an LED feature to better illuminate the work area. ===Features=== Miter saws are dedicated cross cut saws; long rip cuts (in line with the grain) are not possible. A laser guide provides a precise visual indication of where the cut will be positioned on the workpiece in the current configuration. Some models provide a single reference line for one side of the kerf, while others provide two lines to reflect the total kerf width. A blade guard is a cover for the teeth of the cutting blade. Most modern miter saws have self-retracting blade guards, which automatically retract when the saw is lowered onto a workpiece and re-cover the blade when the saw is raised. It is very dangerous to use the saw if these guards are removed or damaged. A dust bag connects directly to the saw, and helps to collect sawdust away from the workpiece during cutting. Optionally, many manufacturers sell adapters to connect an industrial vacuum cleaner in lieu of a bag to capture more of the dust and simplify disposal. Dust removal with these saws is notoriously poor. A safety clamp helps to lock a workpiece into position prior to making a cut. This is an especially important feature when cutting smaller workpieces (eight inches or smaller). The miter table is typically less than 24\\" in diameter.\\"Using Power Tools\\". The Reader's Digest Association, Inc. 1997, p. 62 Typically, the work needs to be supported on the far end to stabilize the piece while cutting. Miter saws are inherently low- hazard as the work piece is held stationary against a fence while the saw head moves, making kick-back almost impossible, and normally allowing hands to be kept clear of the blade. Also the saw head is usually drawn back, then lowered and fed forward through the material so that binding is unlikely. Sliding compound miter saws are relatively portable, easy to set up, and robust enough to maintain accuracy even when moved around. Because they cut from above it is not necessary to adjust blade depth for different thicknesses of work piece and, like any bench machine, repeat cuts are very easy. Most saws have an adjustable scale plate for table swiveling, with positive stops at commonly used angles. Also, there are usually adjustable stops at 90 and 45 degrees for tilting the head, allowing easy and very accurate adjustment of the saw. Table swiveling in both directions is universal but most saws allow head tilting only in one direction (counter-clockwise), although some saws allow head tilting in both directions. Normally the work piece is held flat on the table and so table swiveling will produce a miter cut (blade vertical and angled across work piece), head rotation a bevel cut (blade angled from vertical and square across work piece), and in combination a compound cut. One of the main disadvantages is relatively poor wood chip and dust extraction, as so much of the blade is exposed when cutting, especially in bevel cuts; consequently there is a tendency for chips to fly about. ===Miter saw blades=== Miter saws commonly come in 10\\" and 12\\" blade size configurations and are commonly made of carbon steel and may come with a coating to make the cut easier. While the blade sizes are interchangeable with table saws, a miter blade is optimized for short cuts across the grain of the wood with little pull, where as table saws are optimized for long rip cuts with the grain and pulling the material into the blade. Blades are marked with their number of teeth, kerf and hook angle. Teeth ranges vary from 24 to 100 teeth. The larger number of teeth the finer but slower the cut. The kerf is how much material is removed in making the cut. The standard being a 1/8\\" kerf with thinner options for working finer wood. The hook angle is how aggressively the blade will pull the material in. A low hook angle or even a negative hook angle is designed to cause little board movement during cutting of unclamped boards. Teeth design comes in many variations: ATB (alternating top bevel), FTG (flat top grind) and TCG (triple chip grind) are the most common. Each design is optimized for a specific material and edge treatment. An arbor bolt holds the blade to the miter saw. The diameter of the arbor bolt must match the blade hole size in order to properly secure the blade (12\\" blades commonly use 1\\" arbor holes and 10\\" blades favor 5/8\\"). Arbor bolts are reverse-threaded, meaning they have to be turned clockwise to be loosened. Many inexperienced users strip their arbor bolt as a result. The arbor bolt is designed so that the rotational spin of the saw blade is exerting a tightening pressure on the blade, to prevent the bolt working loose and the flying blade injuring the operator. ===Development=== Power miter saws have been available in various forms since the 1970s as specialized cross cut saws but with limited width of cut, especially compared to radial arm saws. Simple miter saws allowed the saw table to pivot allowing miters to be cut in one plane. Compound miter saws also provided saw head tilting allowing compound miters to be cut. Miter saws with abrasive cutting wheels are often used in metal work where they are known as \\"drop saws\\" or more commonly \\"chop saws\\". Because the blade assembly could only pivot not translate, these initial designs were limited by blade radius in how wide and deep a board they could cut. However their capacities were adequate for handling common sizes of dimensional lumber, and being more compact and portable than arm and table saws, chop saws quickly became ubiquitous in construction. Around 1982 the sliding compound miter saw was introduced which combined all the best features of the compound miter saw with sliding tubes allowing the cutter head to traverse for a much wider cut. Since then it has become the primary cross cut saw for woodworking, largely supplanting the radial arm saw. Manufacturers warn of possible electrocution when used near water or other related saws in close proximity. ==See also== *Miter box *Diamond tools *Backsaw *Radial arm saw *Hack saw *Table saw ==References== == External links == * NIOSH Power Tools Sound and Vibrations Database Category:Metalworking cutting tools Category:Metalworking hand tools Category:Saws Category:Woodworking hand tools ","title":"Miter saw"},{"id":"1434047","text":"Biblical hermeneutics is the study of the principles of interpretation concerning the books of the Bible. It is part of the broader field of hermeneutics, which involves the study of principles of interpretation for all forms of communication, nonverbal and verbal. While Jewish and Christian biblical hermeneutics have some overlap and dialogue, they have distinctly separate interpretative traditions. ==Jewish== ===Traditional=== Talmudical hermeneutics (Hebrew: approximately, ◊û◊ô◊ì◊ï◊™ ◊©◊î◊™◊ï◊®◊î ◊†◊ì◊®◊©◊™ ◊ë◊î◊ü) refers to Jewish methods for the investigation and determination of the meaning of the Hebrew Bible, as well as rules by which Jewish law could be established. One well- known summary of these principles appears in the Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael. Methods by which the Talmud explores the meaning of scripture: :* grammar and exegesis :* the interpretation of certain words and letters and apparently superfluous and/or missing words or letters, and prefixes and suffixes :* the interpretation of those letters which, in certain words, are provided with points :* the interpretation of the letters in a word according to their numerical value (see Gematria) :* the interpretation of a word by dividing it into two or more words (see Notarikon) :* the interpretation of a word according to its consonantal form or according to its vocalization :* the interpretation of a word by transposing its letters or by changing its vowels :* the logical deduction of a halakah from a Scriptural text or from another law The rabbis of the Talmud considered themselves to be the receivers and transmitters of an Oral Torah as to the meaning of the scriptures. They considered this oral tradition to set forth the precise, original meanings of the words, revealed at the same time and by the same means as the original scriptures themselves. Interpretive methods listed above such as word play and letter counting were never used as logical proof of the meaning or teaching of a scripture. Instead they were considered to be an asmakhta, a validation of a meaning that was already set by tradition or a homiletic backing for rabbinic rulings. ===Biblical source criticism=== Among non-Orthodox Jews, there is growing interest in employing biblical source criticism, such as the Documentary hypothesis and the Supplementary hypothesis, for constructing modern Jewish theology,https://images.shulcloud.com/3205/uploads/Documents/Why-should-a-Jew- or-anyone-read-the- Bible.pdfhttps://networks.h-net.org/node/28655/discussions/3194699/cfp- biblical-scholarship-modern-jewish-hermeneutic-special- issuehttps://zeramim.org/past-issues/volume-iii- issue-1-fall-2018-5779-2/a-biblical-challenge-can-an-academic-approach-aimed- at-best-explanation-of-the-biblical-text-be-imported-into-the-synagogue- sermon-world-of-interpretation/https://zeramim.org/past-issues/volume-iii- issue-3-spring-summer-2019-5779/contemporary-jewish-theology-in-light-of- divergent-biblical-views-on-revelations-content-david-frankel/ including the following objectives: :*Reconciling modern morals with biblical passages that condone morally problematic acts, such as genocide and other collective punishment :*Rejecting or accepting folkways, social norms, and linguistic trends, picking and choosing as more fully informed Jews :*Learning lessons in spite of biblical underrepresentation, or outright exclusion, of particular modern phenomenahttps://www.thetorah.com/article/male-homosexual-intercourse- is-prohibited-in-one-part-of-the-torah To at least some extent, this is an application of Talmudical hermeneutics to traditional source criticism of the competing Torah schools: Priestly, Deuteronomic, and one, two, or more that are non-Priestly and non-Deuteronomic. ==Christian== Until the Enlightenment, biblical hermeneutics was usually seen as a form of special hermeneutics (like legal hermeneutics); the status of scripture was thought to necessitate a particular form of understanding and interpretation. In the nineteenth century it became increasingly common to read scripture just like any other writing, although the different interpretations were often disputed. Friedrich Schleiermacher argued against a distinction between \\"general\\" and \\"special\\" hermeneutics, and for a general theory of hermeneutics applicable to all texts, including the Bible. Various methods of higher criticism sought to understand the Bible purely as a human, historical document. The concept of hermeneutics has acquired at least two different but related meanings which are in use today. Firstly, in the older sense, biblical hermeneutics may be understood as the theological principles of exegesis which is often virtually synonymous with 'principles of biblical interpretation' or methodology of biblical exegesis. Secondly, the more recent development is to understand the term 'biblical hermeneutics' as the broader philosophy and linguistic underpinnings of interpretation. The question is posed: \\"How is understanding possible?\\" The rationale of this approach is that, while Scripture is \\"more than just an ordinary text,\\" it is certainly \\"no less than an ordinary text.\\" Scripture is in the first analysis \\"text\\" which human beings try to understand; in this sense, the principles of understanding any text apply to the Bible as well (regardless of whatever other additional, specifically theological principles are considered). The rise of narrative criticism in biblical studies attempts to understand biblical texts on its own terms‚Äîas fundamentally works of literature.James L. Resseguie, Narrative Criticism of the New Testament: An Introduction (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2005), 17-21. In this second sense, all aspects of philosophical and linguistic hermeneutics are considered to be applicable to the biblical texts, as well. There are obvious examples of this in the links between 20th-century philosophy and Christian theology. For example, Rudolf Bultmann's hermeneutical approach was strongly influenced by existentialism, and in particular by the philosophy of Martin Heidegger; and since the 1970s, the philosophical hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer have had a wide-ranging influence on biblical hermeneutics as developed by a wide range of Christian theologians. The French-American philosopher Ren√© Girard follows a similar trail. ===Diverse interpretations=== Biblical scholars have noted the diversity of interpretations by Protestants and to a lesser extent by Catholics. In his forward to R. C. Sproul‚Äôs Knowing Scripture, J. I. Packer observes that Protestant theologians are in conflict about biblical interpretation.R. C. Sproul, Knowing Scripture (Rev. ed., InterVarsity Press, 2009), 10. To illustrate the diversity of biblical interpretations, William Yarchin pictures a shelf full of religious books saying different things, but all claiming to be faithful interpretations of the Bible.William Yarchin, History of Biblical Interpretation: a Reader (Hendrickson, 2004), xi. Bernard Ramm observed that such diverse interpretations underlie the doctrinal variations in Christendom.Bernard Ramm, Protestant Biblical Interpretation:A Textbook of Hermeneutics, 3rd rev ed (Baker Academic, 1980), 3. A mid-19th century book on biblical interpretation observed that even those who believe the Bible to be the word of God hold the most discordant views about fundamental doctrines.The Interpretation of the Bible (Boston; Massachusetts Sabbath School Society, 1844), 15-16. The Catholic Church asserts the capital importance of biblical interpretation and Catholic scholars recognize some diversity in the Bible. This allows for an openness of interpretation as long as it stays within the Catholic Church‚Äôs theological Tradition.Peter Williamson, Catholic Principles for Interpreting Scripture: A Study of the Pontifical Biblical Commission‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Interpretation of the Bible in the Church‚Äù (Gregorian Biblical BookShop, 2001), 23, 121, 254. So it is that theological factors set the parameters for interpreting the Scripture that Catholics believe to be the word of God.David M. Williams, Receiving the Bible in Faith: Historical and Theological Exegesis (CUA Press, 2004), 6-7. Such parameters disallow the widely differing interpretations that make it possible for Protestants to prove almost anything by the Bible.Roy B. Zuck, Basic Bible Interpretation (David C. Cook, 1991), 7. ===Theological hermeneutics as traditional Christian biblical exegesis=== This form of theological hermeneutics in the mainstream Protestant tradition considers Christian biblical hermeneutics in the tradition of explication of the text, or exegesis, to deal with various principles that can be applied to the study of Scripture. If the canon of Scripture is considered as an organic whole, rather than an accumulation of disparate individual texts written and edited in the course of history, then any interpretation that contradicts any other part of scripture is not considered to be sound. Biblical hermeneutics differs from hermeneutics and within traditional Protestant theology, there are a variety of interpretive formulae. Such formulae are generally not mutually exclusive, and interpreters may adhere to several of these approaches at once. These formulae include:This list of \\"principles\\" in conservative evangelical hermeneutics appears to derive from: Hartill, J E 1960. Principles of Biblical Hermeneutics. Grand Rapids: Zondervan. Theological Group of Principles: :*The Historical-grammatical principle based on historical, socio-political, geographical, cultural and linguistic / grammatical context :*Alternate, mutually-exclusive, models of history: :**The Dispensational model or The Chronometrical Principle: \\"During different periods of time, God has chosen to deal in a particular way with man in respect to sin and man's responsibility.\\" :**The Covenantal model: \\"We differentiate between the various contracts that God has made with his people; specifically their provisions, their parties and their purposes.\\" :**The New-Covenantal model: The Old Testament Laws have been fulfilled and abrogated or cancelled with Christ's death, and replaced with the Law of Christ of the New Covenant, although many of the Old Covenant laws are reinstituted under the New Covenant. :*The Ethnic Division Principle: \\"The word of truth is rightly divided in relation to the three classes which it treats, i.e. Jews, Gentiles and the Church.\\" :*The Breach Principle: Interpretation of a certain verse or passage in Scripture is aided by a consideration of certain breaches, either breaches of promise or breaches of time. :*The Christo-Centric Principle: \\"The mind of deity is eternally centered in Christ. All angelic thought and ministry are centered in Christ. All Satanic hatred and subtlety are centered at Christ. All human hopes are, and human occupations should be, centered in Christ. The whole material universe in creation is centered in Christ. The entire written word is centered in Christ.\\" :*The Moral Principle :*The Discriminational Principle: \\"We should divide the word of truth so as to make a distinction where God makes a difference.\\" :*The Predictive Principle :*The Application Principle: \\"An application of truth may be made only after the correct interpretation has been made\\" :*The Principle of Human Willingness in Illumination :*The Context Principle: \\"God gives light upon a subject through either near or remote passages bearing upon the same subject.\\" Sub-divided Context/Mention Principles: :*The First Mention Principle: \\"God indicates in the first mention of a subject the truth with which that subject stands connected in the mind of God.\\" :*The Progressive Mention Principle: \\"God makes the revelation of any given truth increasingly clear as the word proceeds to its consummation.\\" :*The Comparative Mention Principle :*The Full Mention Principle or The Complete Mention Principle: \\"God declares his full mind upon any subject vital to our spiritual life.\\" :*The Agreement Principle: \\"The truthfulness and faithfulness of God become the guarantee that he will not set forth any passage in his word that contradicts any other passage.\\" :*The Direct Statement Principle: \\"God says what he means and means what he says.\\" :*The Gap Principle: \\"God, in the Jewish Scriptures, ignores certain periods of time, leaping over them without comment.\\" :*The Threefold Principle: \\"The word of God sets forth the truths of salvation in a three-fold way: past - justification; present - sanctification/transformation; future - glorification/consummation.\\" :*The Repetition Principle: \\"God repeats some truth or subject already given, generally with the addition of details not before given.\\" :*The Synthetic Principle :*The Principle of Illustrative Mention :*The Double Reference Principle Figures of Speech Group of Principles: :*The Numerical Principle :*The Symbolic Principle :*The Typical Principle: \\"Certain people, events, objects and rituals found in the Old Testament may serve as object lessons and pictures by which God teaches us of his grace and saving power.\\" :*The Parabolic Principle :*The Allegorical Principle ==Techniques== In the interpretation of a text, hermeneutics considers the original medium as well as what language says, supposes, doesn't say, and implies. The process consists of several steps for best attaining the Scriptural author's intended meaning(s). One such process is taught by Henry A Virkler, in Hermeneutics: Principles and Processes of Biblical Interpretation (1981): :*Lexical-syntactical analysis: This step looks at the words used and the way the words are used. Different order of the sentence, the punctuation, the tense of the verse are all aspects that are looked at in the lexical syntactical method. Here, lexicons and grammar aids can help in extracting meaning from the text. :*Historical/cultural analysis: The history and culture surrounding the authors is important to understand to aid in interpretation. For instance, understanding the Jewish sects of the Palestine and the government that ruled Palestine in New Testament times increases understanding of Scripture. And, understanding the connotations of positions such as the High Priest and that of the tax collector helps us know what others thought of the people holding these positions. :*Contextual analysis: A verse out of context can often be taken to mean something completely different from the intention. This method focuses on the importance of looking at the context of a verse in its chapter, book and even biblical context. :*Theological analysis: It is often said that a single verse usually doesn't make a theology. This is because Scripture often touches on issues in several books. For instance, gifts of the Spirit are spoken about in Romans, Ephesians and 1 Corinthians. To take a verse from Corinthians without taking into account other passages that deal with the same topic can cause a poor interpretation. :*Special literary analysis: There are several special literary aspects to look at, but the overarching theme is that each genre of Scripture has a different set of rules that applies to it. Of the genres found in Scripture, there are: narratives, histories, prophecies, apocalyptic writings, poetry, psalms and letters. In these, there are differing levels of allegory, figurative language, metaphors, similes and literal language. For instance, the apocalyptic writings and poetry have more figurative and allegorical language than does the narrative or historical writing. These must be addressed, and the genre recognized to gain a full understanding of the intended meaning. Howard Hendricks, longtime professor of hermeneutics at Dallas Theological Seminary, set out the method of observing the text, interpreting the text, applying the text in his book, Living By the Book. Other major Christian teachers, such as Charles R. (Chuck) Swindoll, who wrote the foreword, Kay Arthur and David Jeremiah have based their hermeneutics on the principles Hendricks teaches. In his book God Centered Biblical Interpretation (1999), Vern Poythress, Professor of New Testament Interpretation at Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia, presented a hermeneutical technique based on the pattern of \\"speaker, discourse, and hearer\\".Poythress, Vern S. (1999). God Centered Biblical Interpretation, p. 109. P&R; Publishing, Phillipsburg, New Jersey. According to Poythress, the study of the Bible must acknowledge all three aspects: God as the speaker, the Bible as His speech, and the people to whom He speaks. Thus, context plays a primary role in Poythress's study of biblical teachings. He lists three general concepts to understand about any passage of Scripture: :*Original time and context: This includes the personal perspective of the writer, the normative perspective of the text itself, and the situational perspective of the original audience. :*Transmission and its context: Understanding the transmission of Scripture includes contemplating the message being sent through the text, taking into account the concerns of individual writers/translators as well as its broader role in the unraveling narrative of history. :*Modern context: Poythress calls interpreters to understand Scripture as \\"what God is saying now\\" to the individual as well as to the modern church.Ibid., p. 121 -122 David L. Barr states there are three obstacles that stand in the way of correctly interpreting the biblical writings: We speak a different language, we live approximately two millennia later, and we bring different expectations to the text.New Testament Story, Wadsworth Publishing, 1995, pg. 15 Additionally, Barr suggests that we approach the reading of the Bible with significantly different literary expectations than those in reading other forms of literature and writing. ===Roman Catholic=== The Catholic Encyclopedia lists a number of principles guiding Roman Catholic hermeneutics in the article on Exegesis (note: the Catholic Encyclopedia was written in 1917 and does not reflect the changes set forth by the encyclical Divino afflante Spiritu published by Pius XII in 1943, which opened modern Catholic biblical scholarship) : :*Historico-grammatical interpretation - The meaning of the literary expression of the Bible is best learned by a thorough knowledge of the languages in which the original text of Scripture was written, and by acquaintance with the Scriptural way of speaking, including the various customs, laws, habits and national prejudices which influenced the inspired writers as they composed their respective books. John Paul II said that: \\"A second conclusion is that the very nature of biblical texts means that interpreting them will require continued use of the historical-critical method, at least in its principal procedures. The Bible, in effect, does not present itself as a direct revelation of timeless truths but as the written testimony to a series of interventions in which God reveals himself in human history. In a way that differs from tenets of other religions [such as Islam, for instance], the message of the Bible is solidly grounded in history. :*Catholic interpretation - Because the Catholic Church is, according to Catholics, the official custodian and interpreter of the Bible, Catholicism's teaching concerning the Sacred Scriptures and their genuine sense must be the supreme guide of the commentator. The Catholic commentator is bound to adhere to the interpretation of texts which the Church has defined either expressly or implicitly. :*Reverence - Since the Bible is God's own book, its study must be begun and prosecuted with a spirit of reverence and prayer. :*Inerrancy - Since God is the principal Author of Sacred Scripture, it can be claimed to contain no error, no self-contradiction, nothing contrary to scientific or historical truth (when the original authors intended historical or scientific truth to be portrayed). Minor contradictions are due to copyist errors in the codex or the translation. Catholics believe the Scripture is God's message put in words by men, with the imperfections this very fact necessarily implies. Catholic hermeneutics strongly supports inerrancy when it comes to principles but not, for example, when dealing with Evangelists' orthographic mistakes. According to Pope John Paul II, \\"Addressing men and women, from the beginnings of the Old Testament onward, God made use of all the possibilities of human language, while at the same time accepting that his word be subject to the constraints caused by the limitations of this language. Proper respect for inspired Scripture requires undertaking all the labors necessary to gain a thorough grasp of its meaning. :*Patristics - The Holy Fathers are of supreme authority whenever they all interpret in one and the same manner any text of the Bible, as pertaining to the doctrine of faith or morals; for their unanimity clearly evinces that such interpretation has come down from the Apostles as a matter of Catholic faith. Pope Benedict XVI has indicated in Verbum Domini, the post-synodal apostolic exhortation on the Word of God, that \\"Christianity...perceives in the words the Word himself, the Logos who displays his mystery through this complexity and the reality of human history\\". He encourages a ‚Äúfaith-filled interpretation of Sacred Scripture‚Äù. He emphasizes that this manner of interpretation, ‚Äúpracticed from antiquity within the Church‚Äôs Tradition...recognizes the historical value of the biblical tradition\\". It \\"seeks to discover the living meaning of the Sacred Scriptures for the lives of believers today while not ignoring the human mediation of the inspired text and its literary genres\\". Verbum Domini #44. ===Eastern Orthodox=== :*God is real and is incarnated in our Lord Jesus Christ. Everything pertaining to the Scriptures must be understood Christologically. Jesus Christ, the incarnate Second Person of the Holy Trinity, is the center of all that we as Christians do, and being Himself the very Truth, He is the only gate through which we may enter into understanding of the Bible, both Old and New Testaments (though not all that is contained in the Old Testament is directly relevant for Christians). The Bible ultimately is about Christ and assists us in our union with Him. :*Only the pure in heart \\"shall see God.\\" That is, our spiritual state has a direct bearing on our interpretation of the Scriptures. As St. Athanasius said, \\"One cannot possibly understand the teaching of the saints unless one has a pure mind and is trying to imitate their life.\\" Because the Scripture is a book inspired by the Holy Spirit and given through holy men, one's own holiness is directly relevant to the ability to interpret the book correctly. Unlike any other book, the Bible's words are \\"spirit and life,\\" and so we must live spiritually in order to drink from this spiritual well. Clearly, prayer and spiritual discipline are necessary in order to understand Scripture properly. :*Understanding of the Scripture comes with living its contents. As the quote from St. Athanasius illustrates, one must both have a pure mind and be trying to imitate the saints' lives in order to understand their teaching, a dual principle which applies most of all to the teaching of the saints in the Bible. This life is particularly expressed in terms of living out the commandments and attempting to imitate Christ's life of the Gospel. :*The primary end of Scriptural hermeneutics is that of the whole Christian life, theosis (deification/divinization). That is, our purpose in attempting to understand the Bible must not be merely for academic inquiry but rather must be in order to become fully divinized human beings, soaked with the life of God, participating in His divine energies, growing to the fullness of the stature of Christ. We interpret Scripture in order to become by grace what Christ is by nature, to \\"become god.\\" :*Only within the community of the Church can the Bible be understood. It was written by the Church, in the Church and for the Church. Thus, it is a \\"family document\\" which is the highest point of Holy Tradition, taken with faith alongside the writings of the Fathers, the Liturgy, the Icons, the Lives of the Saints, and so on. :*The Scripture is a witness to the truth, not an exhaustive tome on Christian living. Nowhere in the words of Scripture itself can we find the teaching that it is all-sufficient for Christian life. What we as Orthodox Christians do must always be consonant with the Scriptures, but explicit mention of a practice or teaching in the Scripture is not a requirement for its inclusion in the life of the Church. The Apostle Paul himself mentions the reality of unwritten sources of Church Tradition being equally in force for the believer in II Thessalonians 2:15, that these traditions to which we must \\"stand fast and hold\\" may be \\"by word or by our epistle.\\" Examples of practices not explicit in Scripture are making the Sign of the Cross, triple immersion for baptism, and having monasticism. St. Basil the Great even says that without maintaining the unwritten traditions of the Church, we \\"mutilate the Gospel\\" (On the Spirit 66). :*We must respect the integrity of the canon of the Bible as given to us in the Church's Tradition. Searches for other texts written by apostles or prophets may be interesting and of scholarly merit, but they are not part of the hermeneutical project within the Church. Or conversely, attempts to debunk the authorship or authenticity of the books in the canon are also outside the Church's life. If we were to find a verifiable \\"new\\" work by St. Paul or to discover that Moses did not in fact write Genesis, neither finding would have any bearing on the canon. It is what it is. :*We must use every resource at our disposal in interpreting the Scripture to bring ourselves and others to the knowledge of the truth. Certainly, there must be spiritual discernment in knowing how to use those resources, but at least theoretically, anything can be used to come to know the truth better as it is revealed in Holy Writ. :*We must have humility when approaching Scripture. Even some of the Church's greatest and most philosophically sophisticated saints stated that some passages were difficult for them. We must therefore be prepared to admit that our interpretations may be wrong, submitting them to the judgment of the Church. :*We may make use in a secondary fashion of the resources of academic scholarship, whether logic, archaeology, linguistics, et cetera. These resources can be helpful in terms of illuminating our understanding of Scripture, but they must always be given only secondary prominence in the project and always only in conjunction with all these other hermeneutic principles. Primary must always be our life in the Church, living, studying and knowing the Bible within that vivified and salvific Holy Tradition. ===Trajectory hermeneutics=== Trajectory hermeneutics or redemptive-movement hermeneutics (RMH) is a hermeneutical approach that seeks to locate varying 'voices' in the text and to view these voices as a progressive trajectory through history (or at least through the biblical witness); often a trajectory that progresses through to the present day. The contemporary reader of Scripture is in some way envisaged by the biblical text as standing in continuity with a developing theme therein. The reader, then, is left to discern this trajectory and appropriate it accordingly. William J. Webb employed such a hermeneutic, in his Slaves, Women & Homosexuals. Webb shows how the moral commands of the Old and New Testament were a significant improvement over the surrounding cultural values and practices. Webb identified 18 different ways in which God dealt with his people moving against the current of popular cultural values. While for Webb the use of this hermeneutic moves to highlight the progressive liberation of women and slaves from oppressive male/bourgeois dominance, the prohibition of homosexual acts consistently moves in a more conservative manner than that of the surrounding Ancient Near East or Graeco-Roman societies. While Paul does not explicitly state that slavery should be abolished, the trajectory seen in Scripture is a progressive liberation of slaves. When this is extended to modern times, it implies that the biblical witness supports the abolition of slavery. The progressive liberation of women from oppressive patriarchalism, traced from Genesis and Exodus through to Paul's own acknowledgement of women as 'co- workers' (), sets a precedent that when applied to modern times suggests that women ought to have the same rights and roles afforded to men. Historically, the biblical witness has become progressively more stringent in its views of homosexual practice and the implications of this are not commented upon by Webb. == See also == * Allegorical interpretation of the Bible * Anagoge * Christian apologetics * Biblical accommodation * Biblical law in Christianity * Biblical literalism * Biblical studies * Brevitas et facilitas * Formulary controversy concerning Jansenius' Augustinus in the 17th century * Jewish commentaries on the Bible * Literary criticism * Literary theory * Narrative criticism * Patternism * Postmodern Christianity * Principles of interpretation * Quranic hermeneutics * Summary of Christian eschatological differences * Syncretism ==References== ===Further reading=== * Brown, Raymond E., Joseph A.

She was not commissioned into the US Navy but was instead transferred to the Royal Navy under the Lend-Lease agreement and commissioned on 31 October 1943.HMS Kempthorne's career ==Royal Navy service== ===Initial training and refitting=== After commissioning Kempthorne carried out training exercise in the Boston area in November before taking passage to Bermuda. Throughout December she carried out further exercises and shore training, after which she sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia to join convoy HX-274 bound for the UK. Also sailing to the UK as part of this convoy were her sister corvettes , and , which had also been at Bermuda taking part in exercises. They sailed on 6 January as members of the convoy rather than as escorts as they lacked the necessary equipment and were not properly trained. On arrival in British waters on 21 January they were detached and sailed to Belfast. Here they underwent a refit to replace unsatisfactory US Navy equipment. The ships were fitted with an Admiralty design gyro compass and depth charge arrangements, as well as receiving the latest sonar systems and a Royal Navy design radio direction finding outfit. The refit lasted until late February, and on its completion on 28 February Kempthorne was nominated to deploy with the 5th Escort Group in the Western Approaches Command. Further sea trials were carried out in March, followed by a period of work-up at Tobermory. She then joined the Group at Belfast in April, serving alongside her sisters , , , , , and Goodson. The senior officer of the group was Commander Donald MacIntyre, who had already achieved renown as the commander of the 2nd Escort Group. ===Deployed in the Atlantic=== Kempthorne first deployed with the group on 21 April, helping to escort the westbound convoy ONS-233 in appalling weather. They were then detached from the convoy on 26 April to join the aircraft carrier and the ships of the 9th Escort Group deploying to defend convoys under threat of attack from German U-boats. They made contact with Vindex and the group on 2 May. They refuelled from Vindex, whilst the ships of the 9th Group returned to Canada to refuel. Kempthorne, Goodson and Keats were then deployed as a close escort for Vindex. They remained with Vindex for several days and on 6 May the was detected by HMS Bickerton. Fairey Swordfish of 825 Naval Air Squadron were scrambled from Vindex whilst Bligh, Bickerton and Aylmer carried out depth charge attacks. These attacks brought U-765 to the surface where she was engaged by surface gunfire from the attacking ships. A Swordfish then dropped two depth charges which sank U-765. Further refuelling of the escorts was carried out on 9 May and the ships returned to the Clyde with Vindex on 14 May. ===South Western Approaches=== They then sailed to Belfast, where the group was nominated to support Operation Neptune, the Normandy Landings. The group was then deployed at Moelfre Bay in the Clyde area by 28 May. In early June the group moved to the South Western Approaches to intercept U-boats which might be attempting to enter the English Channel to interfere with the landings. During this time the group remained under the command of CinC Home Fleet and was not attached to the Naval Commander Expeditionary Force. Whilst Kempthorne was patrolling off The Lizard with the on 15 June, they came under attack from , which torpedoed and sank Mourne. Kempthorne survived and on 26 June was present at the sinking of by HMS Bickerton. Bickerton was then dispatched to Plymouth with the survivors of U-269, with HMS Goodson became the Senior Officer‚Äôs ship. Later that day the group was attacked by and Goodson was seriously damaged by a torpedo hit. She was towed into port by HMS Bligh, but was found to be beyond economical repair. ===Attempted attack on the Tirpitz=== Kempthorne and the group were released from their duties in the South West Approaches in July and returned to Belfast, where they were nominated for Home Fleet screening duties. After a period spent undergoing essential repairs and repainting, the group sailed to Scapa Flow on 12 August. On 18 August they were deployed as a screen for the escort carriers and for the planned air attacks on the , lying at anchor in Altenfjord, Norway. This was designated Operation Goodwood. Adverse weather hampered operations however and the attempt was aborted on 20 August. Whilst waiting in the area for an improvement in the weather, Nabob and Bickerton were attacked by . Nabob was hit, but was able to return to Scapa Flow under her own steam. Bickerton was also critically damaged. Kempthorne took off casualties and non-essential personnel, but it was later decided to scuttle Bickerton and she was sunk three hours after being hit. The ships returned to the Clyde on 30 August and Commander MacIntyre was relieved by Commander BW Taylor. The group then returned to defending the Atlantic convoys with the Western Approaches Command in September. In October they were deployed to escort a military convoy from the UK to Naples and on their return in December they were deployed in the North Western Approaches to intercept U-boats that had been forced by the advancing Allied armies to sail from the North German and Norwegian submarine bases to reach the Atlantic convoy routes. ===Irish Sea=== In 1945 Kempthorne deployed with the group in the Irish Sea and the South Western Approaches. On 26 January the group was deployed to come to the assistance of the 4th Escort Group which was attacking . Both groups then launched surface attacks, before HMS Aylmer rammed and sank the submarine. They then began to search for another submarine known to be in the area, and posing a threat to the inbound convoy HX-332 as it passed through the Irish Sea bound for Liverpool. The submarine, was detected on 27 January by HMS Keats and then sunk by HMS Bligh, Keats and Tyler. Kempthorne remained deployed with the group in the North Western Approaches throughout February and March 1945, followed by a period off the west of Ireland and the north west of Scotland in April. In May 1945, she was one of two British warships which presided over the surrender of the German U-boats at Trondheim, Norway.Uboat.net She was then nominated to be returned early to the US and was paid off by June. ==Decommissioning and scrapping== Kempthorne was returned to the custody of the United States on 20 August 1945 and was commissioned in the United States Navy the same day for the voyage home. She arrived at Philadelphia on 8 September 1945 and was decommissioned at the navy yard there on 17 October. She was struck from the U.S. Navy list on 1 November 1945 and scrapped by 28 May 1946. == References == * * HMS Kempthorne's career * Kempthorne at Uboat.net ==External links== * Boston Naval Shipyard Production Record - Haze Gray Underway * Kempthorne - Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships * The Captain Class Frigates Association.

Louvi√©roise, sometimes referred to as La Louvi√®re or RAAL, was a Belgian football club located in the city of La Louvi√®re, in the province of Hainaut. It had been playing its latest run in the Belgian First Division from 2000‚Äì01 to 2005‚Äì06 included. Two players have been called to the Belgium national football team while at La Louvi√®re: Guy Dardenne (6 caps when at La Louvi√®re, 11 caps in all) and Silvio Proto (5 caps when at La Louvi√®re). The matricule of the club was the number 93. In June 2009, it merged with R.A.C.S. Couillet to form Football Couillet La Louvi√®re. ==History== The club was founded on January 26, 1913 during a meeting at the Place Maugr√©tout in La Louvi√®re. It was named A.A. Louvi√©roise. After one season in a provincial league, the football stopped due to the War. The club did not play official matches until 1921 as it had no stadium. Between 1921 and 1937 Louvi√©roise played in the provincial leagues. In 1937 the club changed its name to R.A.A. Louvi√©roise and it reached the Promotion. The next year a Belgian international player (namely August Hellemans who played in the 1930 World Cup) was transferred at La Louvi√®re. The club had its first spell in the first division between 1977 and 1979. In 1984 it was relegated to the third division and it played at that level for 10 years. Between 1994 and 2000 it played in the second division. In 2006 the club was one of the most frequently mentioned in a gambling scandal that rocked Belgian football. It was alleged in the Belgian press that several players, board members and manager Gilbert Bodart had accepted large sums of money from Chinese businessman Zheyun Ye, who wanted to influence the results in matches so he could manufacture high profits in gambling. At first the club strongly denied the allegations, but on February 21, 2006 Bodart resigned as manager. His assistant, former La Louvi√®re forward Fr√©d√©ric Tilmant replaced him at the helm of the club but could not avoid RAAL finishing in last place in the division. This meant the club would have to play in the second division for the 2006‚Äì07 season. However, on May 16, 2006 the club was refused its license to play in the second division. It subsequently appealed the decision but the Appeal Commission of the Belgian Football Association confirmed the judgement of May 16. The club eventually seized the Evocation Commission which rejected the plaint of La Louvi√®re on June 15, 2006. The day after, chairman Filippo Gaone retired from the club as it would play the third division in 2006‚Äì07. In 2009, La Louvi√®re merged with R.A.C.S. Couillet to form Football Couillet La Louvi√®re, with the matricule number 93 begin retired as the new club continued with the number 94 of R.A.C.S.

It lies at the southern end of the Snowdonia National Park near the town of Dolgellau. The peak, which is one of the most popular in Wales for walkers and hikers, is composed largely of Ordovician igneous rocks, with classic glacial erosion features such as cwms, moraines, striated rocks, and roches moutonn√©es. ==Etymology== Cadair Idris means 'Idris's Chair'. Idris is usually taken to be the name of a giant or, alternatively, it may refer to Idris ap Gwyddno (or Gweiddno), a 7th-century prince of Meirionnydd who won a battle against the Irish on the mountain. Idris ap Gwyddno was in fact referred to as Idris Gawr (\\"Idris the Giant\\") in some mediaeval genealogies of Meirionydd. The basic meaning of the word cadair (Middle Welsh/Early Modern Welsh kadeir or cadeir) is 'seat, chair' (borrowed from the Greek cathedra 'chair'). In place names cadair can mean 'stronghold, fort, fortress' or 'mountain or hill shaped like a chair'. The spelling cader represents a spoken variant of the standard form cadair.Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru s.n. 'cadair'. It appears that Cadair/Cadeir Idris is the form used in the earliest Welsh-language sources. In a poem in his own hand in the second half of the 15th century, the poet Lewys Glyn Cothi wrote 'Dros gadair idris gedy' ('and then over Cadair Idris').Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, Peniarth MS 70, 21a; Dafydd Johnston (ed.), Gwaith Lewys Glyn Cothi (Caerdydd: Gwasg Prifysgol Cymru), p. 478 (221.16). Around 1600, John Jones of Gellilyfdy referred to 'y mynydh neu bhan neu bhoel a elwir Cadeir Idris' ('the mountain, peak or hill known as Cadeir Idris'). The spoken form represented by cader had developed by the end of the Middle Ages and as a result the form Cader Idris was often used in English and Latin documents at that time and in more recent documents in English and Welsh.Gw. Archif Melville Richards s.n. 'Cadair Idris'. In his Dictionarum Duplex published in 1632, John Davies of Mallwyd differentiated between the two words cadair ('chair') and cader ('fort, fortress'), referring to 'Cader Idris' and 'Cader Ddinmael'. That interpretation was followed by some later lexicographers, including Thomas Charles and Titus Lewis. It is now accepted, however, that cader is a spelling of a spoken form of cadair, and that there is no evidence that cadair and cader are separate words. But as it represents the pronunciation in the local dialect, the spelling Cader Idris is often seen in Welsh and English, and in June 2016 Snowdonia National Park decided to adopt that spelling on its signage, despite advice from the Welsh Language Commissioner and from Park officers, who favoured 'Cadair'. The local dialect form is also seen in the name of the local secondary school, Ysgol y Gader. The name of the mountain is typically spelt Cadair Idris on current maps. The summit of the mountain is known as Penygader (\\"top of the chair/stronghold\\"). ==Ascent== There are three main trails that lead to the top of Cadair Idris. The summit, which is covered in scree, is marked by a trig point. There is also a low-standing stone shelter with a roof. ===Pony Path=== The Pony Path (Welsh: Llwybr Pilin Pwn), which begins in the north from either Dolgellau or the Mawddach estuary, is the easiest but the longest of the main trails. Its length from the mountain's base is with a climb. ===Fox's Path=== The Fox's Path (Welsh: Llwybr Madyn),This is the most direct way to the summit as the trail leads straight up the northern face. The ascent involves a climb up a cliff-scree face. However, this part of the Fox's Path has been heavily eroded in recent years making the descent dangerous. ===Minffordd Path=== The Minffordd Path (Welsh: Llwybr Minffordd) starts on the southern side of the mountain near the glacial Tal-y-llyn Lake. Hikers using this ascent climb past Llyn Cau and along the rim of Craig Cau (rockwall) to Penygadair. Its length is and involves two climbs of over . ==Geology== A roche moutonn√©e near Llyn Cau. The direction of the glacial movement was from left to right. Cadair Idris is formed from a complexly fractured and folded pile of both sedimentary rocks and igneous rocks of Ordovician age. They comprise the mudstones and siltstones of the Ceiswyn Formation which form much of the southern part of the mountain, together with the varied rocks of the underlying Aran Volcanic Group. The steep cliffs rising above Llyn Cau to the north are formed from hard-wearing basalts and tuffs of the Pen y Gadair Volcanic Formation whilst those on the south side are acid tuffs of the Craig Cau Formation. The imposing cliffs which characterise the north side of the mountain are formed from a microgranite intruded into the Ty'r Gawen mudstones. In common with the rest of Snowdonia, the faulting and folding of this rock succession took place during the Caledonian Orogeny. The crater-like shape of Cwm Cau has given rise to the occasional mistaken claim that Cadair Idris is an extinct volcano (though as noted above, some of its bedrock is volcanic in origin). This theory was discounted as early as 1872, when Charles Kingsley commented in his book Town Geology: The natural bowl-shaped depression to which the name of chair has been attached, was formed by a cirque glacier during multiple ice ages when snow and ice accumulated on these slopes partly through avalanching. The glacier was up to a square kilometre in size surrounded on three sides by steep cliffs the highest being the headwall. The chair of Cadair Idris is this bowl-shaped hollow in the bedrock formed by the movement of glacial ice across the floor of the hollow, abrading it and the lip over which it then flowed. There are several tear-drop shaped knolls above the edge of Llyn Cau, each of which is a roche moutonn√©e formed by the abrasive action of the moving ice. The two highest lakes are Llyn Cau and Llyn y Gader; the latter is thought to have a maximum depth of about . Much of the area around Cadair Idris was designated a National Nature Reserve in 1957, and is home to Arctic‚Äìalpine plants such as purple saxifrage and dwarf willow. ==Myths, legends and popular culture== Looking at Penygadair (right) from the Pony Path in January 2005. The steep scree route of the Fox's Path is highlighted in sunlight (centre). Cadair Idris in 1818 There are numerous legends about Cadair Idris. Some nearby lakes are supposed to be bottomless, and anyone who sleeps on its slopes alone will supposedly awaken either a madman or a poet. This tradition (of sleeping on the summit of the mountain) apparently stems from bardic traditions, where bards would sleep on the mountain in hope of inspiration. Although the mountain's name is typically taken to refer to the mythological giant Idris, who was said to have been skilled in poetry, astronomy and philosophy, it has sometimes been mistranslated as Arthur's Seat, in reference to King Arthur (and to the hill of the same name in Edinburgh), an idea used by author Susan Cooper in her book The Grey King. However, this translation is mistaken and there is no etymological or traditional connection between Idris and Arthur. In Welsh mythology, Cadair Idris is also said to be one of the hunting grounds of Gwyn ap Nudd and his C≈µn Annwn. The howling of these huge dogs foretold death to anyone who heard them, the pack sweeping up that person's soul and herding it into the underworld. The mountain is mentioned several times and is used as a backdrop to the story of Mary Jones and her Bible. This story is an account of a girl from Llanfihangel-y-Pennant at the foot of the mountain who walked 25 miles to Bala in order to buy a bible, which were scarce at the time. Jones' determined journey to get hold of a copy of the book in 1800 was a major factor behind the foundation of the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1804. \\"Tongues of fire on Idris flaring\\" is mentioned in the opening verse of the John Guard version of the song Men of Harlech. In Cassandra Clare's Clockwork Princess Idris is where final battle between the protagonists and antagonist takes place. ==References== ==External links== *Information about Cadair Idris *Computer generated summit panoramas North South index *A description of and guide to climbing Cadair Idris from h2g2 *Cadair Idris Walk Via the Pony Path *Cadair Idris Long Walk from Llanfihangel-y-pennant *Summary of the Walks up Cader Idris *Walking on Cadair Idris - Inside Welsh Sport Category:Arthog Category:Dolgellau Category:Abergynolwyn Category:Llanfihangel-y-Pennant Category:Mountains and hills of Gwynedd Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in East Gwynedd Category:Mountains and hills of Snowdonia Category:Hardys of Wales Category:Hewitts of Wales Category:Landmarks in Wales Category:Marilyns of Wales Category:National nature reserves in Wales Category:Nuttalls ","title":"Cadair Idris"},{"id":"1434079","text":"Masjid in Singapore. Hajjah Fatimah binte Sulaiman (), also known as Hajjah Fatimah and as the \\"Sultana of Gowa\\", was a Singaporean merchant and philanthropist. After the death of her second husband, she combined his business with her own boats and built it into a successful naval trading operation. Fatimah is best known for commissioning the mosque that bears her name, Masjid Hajjah Fatimah. In recognition of her philanthropy in funding the creation of the mosque, as well as homes for the poor that were adjacent to it, Fatimah was inducted into the Singapore Women's Hall of Fame in 2014. ==Background== Fatimah binte Sulaiman was born in Malacca, Malaysia, to a family of successful traders. Her year of birth is not certain, but is believed to be 1754. After the collapse of an unsuccessful first marriage, she married Daing Chanda Pulih, a Bugis prince and merchant from South Sulawesi (then known as Celebes). Pulih had a trading post in Singapore, and brought Fatimah binte Sulaiman with him to the island. Pulih died while Fatimah was still young, and she combined his business with her own boats and built a successful steamship and sailboat-based trading operation. Before her husband died, Fatimah had a daughter with him, Raja Siti. Raja would go on to marry Sayyid Ahmad ibn ‚ÄòAbdur-Rahman As-Saqqaf, whose family would become known for their philanthropy, like Fatimah herself. Fatimah is commonly referred to as \\"Hajjah Fatimah\\", indicating that she made the a pilgrimage to Mecca, or Hajj. The exact date of her death is unknown, but her family claims that Fatimah lived to the age of 98. She is buried on the grounds of the Masjid Hajjah Fatimah, along with her husband, her daughter and son-in-law's, and several of their descendants. ==Masjid Hajjah Fatimah== Fatimah's wealth led to her becoming known as the \\"Sultana of Gowa\\". It also made her residence in Kampong Glam the target of thieves, who burgled it twice and set it on fire during the second burglary. After the fire, Fatimah -- thankful that she was not present for the burglaries and thus was not harmed -- donated money and the land that her house was on in provide for the construction of a mosque, which became the Masjid Hajjah Fatimah. Fatimah rebuilt her own house, and also funded the construction of houses for the poor, in the land adjacent to the new. The Masjid Hajjah Fatimah is one of only a small number of mosques that are named after women. For her philanthropy and role in establishing the mosque that bears her name, Hajjah Fatimah binte Sulaiman was inducted into the Singapore Women's Hall of Fame in 2014, the Hall of Fame's inaugural year. She had previously been honored in a nine-member Wall of Fame that evolved into the larger Hall of Fame. ==References== Category:Singaporean philanthropists Category:People from Malacca Category:Singaporean businesspeople Category:Year of death uncertain Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:1750s births Category:1850s deaths ","title":"Fatimah binte Sulaiman"},{"id":"1434085","text":"R.A.E.C.

The group, led by Scout Group Leader J√≥zefa Kantor, was established on 30 November 1941. At first, Mury consisted of a small number of patriotic Girl Scouts. Then, later on, it grew to five units with about 100 young women. Their main activities included organizing food and medical supplies for the sick fellow prisoners, moral, psychological and religious support for the group members and other women in the concentration camp. The members of the group held regular meetings in various blocks in the concentration camp, where they received not only new tasks and daily instructions from the group leaders, but also acquired Scouting knowledge and high school education from fellow prisoners who had been experienced academic teachers (and subsequently incarcerated in the concentration camp as political prisoners). Based on the Nazis' incomplete transport list Zugangsliste consisting 25,028 names of women sent by Nazis to the camp, it is estimated that inmates of Ravensbr√ºck ethnic structure was the following: Poles 24.9%, Germans 19.9%, Jews 15.1%, Russians 15.0%, French 7.3%, Gypsies 5.4%, other 12.4%. The Gestapo categorized the inmates as follows: political 83,54%, anti-social 12,35%, criminal 2,02%, Jehovah's Witnesses 1.11%, racial defilement 0.78%, other 0.20%.

A frame check sequence (FCS) is an error-detecting code added to a frame in a communications protocol. Frames are used to send payload data from a source to a destination. == Purpose == All frames and the bits, bytes, and fields contained within them, are susceptible to errors from a variety of sources. The FCS field contains a number that is calculated by the source node based on the data in the frame. This number is added to the end of a frame that is sent. When the destination node receives the frame the FCS number is recalculated and compared with the FCS number included in the frame. If the two numbers are different, an error is assumed and the frame is discarded. The FCS provides error detection only. Error recovery must be performed through separate means. Ethernet, for example, specifies that a damaged frame should be discarded and does not specify any action to cause the frame to be retransmitted. Other protocols, notably the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), can notice the data loss and initiate retransmission and error recovery.Cf: Wendell ODOM, Ccie #1624, Cisco Official Cert Guide, Book 1, Chapter 3: Fundamentals of LANs, Page 74 ==Implementation== Detailed structure of an Ethernet frame The FCS is often transmitted in such a way that the receiver can compute a running sum over the entire frame, together with the trailing FCS, expecting to see a fixed result (such as zero) when it is correct.

North is to the left of the photo. Salt Lake City is located in a large valley, the Salt Lake Valley, separated by the Wasatch Mountains to the east and the Oquirrh Mountains to the west. Salt Lake City is located at 40¬∞45'17\\" North, 111¬∞53'33\\" West (40.754700, -111.892622). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 285.9 km¬≤ (110.4 mi¬≤). 282.5 km¬≤ (109.1 mi¬≤) of it is land and 3.3 km¬≤ (1.3 mi¬≤) of it is water. The total area is 1.17% water. Like most of the cities stretching north and south of Salt Lake City (see Ogden and Provo), it lies at the base of the Wasatch Mountains, which in some places rise impressively 6,000 feet (1,850 m) above the valley floor. This metro area is known commonly as the Wasatch Front. Most of the valley floor is built up, except for some rapidly disappearing fields and farms on the south and west sides of the valley. Some parts of the benches have residential construction. The valley floor is the lake bed of the ancient Lake Bonneville, of which the Great Salt Lake is a remnant. Soils in the valley are largely clay and sand, which exposes the city's edifices to considerable risk of damage due to liquefaction caused by an earthquake. The Wasatch Fault runs along the eastern benches of the city, and geologists consider it due for a major earthquake. On February 21, 2008 a 6.2M earthquake hit Eastern Nevada 42 miles west of Wendover, Utah and could be felt in northern Utah, including Salt Lake City (200+ miles away). The marshlands and mudflats to the south and east of the Great Salt Lake border the city's northwest side. Freshwater estuaries enter the lake here, and the lower salinity combines with the marshy terrain to result in considerable algae growth. Under certain weather conditions, which occur up to roughly a dozen times a year, some of the algae dies off and decays, and the northwest winds carry the scent of decaying algae into the city. The smell is known as \\"lake stink\\". ==References== ","title":"Geography of Salt Lake City"},{"id":"1434118","text":"Portrait of William, circle of Quentin Matsys Coat of Arms William de Cro√ø William II de Cro√ø, Lord of Chi√®vres (1458 - 28 May 1521) (also known as: Guillaume II de Cro√ø, sieur de Chi√®vres in French; Guillermo II de Cro√ø, se√±or de Chi√®vres, Xevres or Xebres in Spanish; Willem II van Cro√ø, heer van Chi√®vres in Dutch) (later Duke of Sora and Arce, Baron of Roccaguglielma (all three in Kingdom of Naples, now in Frosinone province), 1st count of Beaumont, 1st Marquess of Aarschot, Lord of Temse) was the chief tutor and First Chamberlain to Charles V. William was the second son of Philippe de Cro√ø, Lord of Aarschot and Jacoba of Luxembourg. William married Maria-Magdalena of Hamal, widow of Adolf van der Marck. William bought the lordships of Beaumont and Chi√®vres from his father in 1485. In 1489 he was one of the lords who tried to reason with Philip of Cleves during his rebellion against Maximilian of Austria. William was also elected a Knight of the Golden Fleece in 1491. He became part of the court of Philip the Handsome in 1494, but did not accompany Philip on his first voyage to Spain in 1501‚Äì03. After Philip's death in 1506, William became part of the regency council and held chief responsibility for the finances of the Low Countries, as well as being supreme commander. He was confirmed in his tasks by Emperor Maximilian in 1510. In 1509 he also became chief tutor of young Archduke Charles as a replacement for Charles de Cro√ø, prince of Chimay. William helped engineer Charles taking the title of Duke of Burgundy, and moved the nine-year-old Charles away from the court of Margaret of Austria so that he could better influence Charles.Haliczer, p. 138. The young man was dependent on William‚Äîwho plotted to have Charles declared to be of age at fifteen and appointed Grand Chamberlain‚Äîfor advice. Charles named William part of his first council in 1515 and rewarded him with the Duchy of Sora and Arce, and Rocca Guglielma in 1516. Charles raised Beaumont to a county and Aarschot (which William inherited from his father in 1511) to a margraviate between 1517 and 1519. Other functions William acquired were: * Grand-Bailli of Hainaut (1497‚Äì1503) * Stadtholder of Namur (since 1503) * Admiral of the Kingdom of Naples and Chief Admiral of all countries (in 1516) * Chief of the Spanish treasury (contador mayor) (since 1517, though later sold to Alvaro de Z√∫√±iga, duke of B√©jar, for 30,000 ducats) It was on William's advice that Charles sent his brother Ferdinand away from Spain. Ferdinand was loved by the people and Spanish-born, while Charles was distrusted as a foreigner. The fear was that Ferdinand might be used as a figurehead for a revolt.Seaver, p. 42. He arranged for his namesake twenty- year-old nephew to be appointed Archbishop of Toledo. He was thus able to enjoy the immense revenues the see generated from afar.Seaver, p. 61. This appointment landed Charles in trouble later, as the appointment of an unqualified young foreigner offended the sensibilities of the Spanish and helped provoke the Revolt of the Comuneros. William insisted that Charles become a candidate for the Imperial election in 1519 and was present at the Diet of Worms in 1521, where he was opposed to the violent persecution of Martin Luther and his followers. Charles broke with his advisors and went to war against France. William died in 1521 with the cause recorded as poison. Protestant followers of Martin Luther were blamed for this purported reprisal for the Edict of Worms which had been issued three days earlier on 25 May 1521. William was married to Marie de Hamal, but the marriage was childless. He was succeeded by his other nephew Philippe II de Cro√ø. ==Cultural depiction== In television, William de Cro√ø was portrayed by Helio Pedregal in the Spanish fictional historical series Carlos, rey emperador (Carlos, King Emperor) == References == === Citations === === Sources === * Hans Cools, Mannen met Macht (Walburg Pers, Zutphen, 2001) * * == External links == * Category:1458 births Category:1521 deaths William de Croy Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece Category:16th-century Belgian people ","title":"William de Cro√ø"},{"id":"1434123","text":"The year 1946 in art involved some significant events and new works. ==Events== * March ‚Äì Art collector Peggy Guggenheim publishes the first edition of her autobiographical Out of This Century in the United States. * April 2 ‚Äì Jackson Pollock's third solo exhibition opens in the Daylight Gallery of Peggy Guggenheim's The Art of This Century gallery on Manhattan. * May 22 ‚Äì The Equestrian statue of Christian V recast in bronze by Einar Utzon- Frank (1688 original by Abraham-C√©sar Lamoureux) is unveiled on Kongens Nytorv, Copenhagen. * October 11 ‚Äì National Gallery of Bosnia and Herzegovina established in Sarajevo. * October 24 ‚Äì In a double ceremony, Max Ernst (having been divorced from Peggy Guggenheim) marries Dorothea Tanning and Man Ray marries Juliet P.

This is a museum of days past, recreating scenes of rural life such as a minister's parlour; a schoolroom; a laundry; and an agricultural area, along with displays of tools, everyday artifacts, and old crafts. It is housed in an adapted row of single storey stone cottages, originally built in 1793. The parish church of Glamis, dedicated to Saint Fergus, was founded in the early medieval period (probably 8th century AD). The present building is 18th- century with an interior recast in the 1930s, but retains a vaulted 15th- century aisle from the medieval church which preceded it. The aisle is the burial place (photo) of the Bowes-Lyon family, owners of Glamis Castle. One of its park gates is situated near the parish church. The castle hosts various events throughout the year, notably the Proms evening when thousands of people traditionally turn out with picnics ranging from the small to the elaborate. ==In Shakespeare== In the tragedy of Macbeth by William Shakespeare, Macbeth is the Thane of Glamis. He later becomes the Thane of Cawdor and the king of Scotland, in fulfillment of the witches' prophecy. Even though Glamis is only a small village, several cities in Britain have streets named after it. This is due to the popularity of naming streets after Shakespearean characters and locations during the Victorian Era. ==See also== *Ark Hill *Castleton *Charleston *Eassie Stone *Glamis Castle *Lord of Glamis *Monster of Glamis *Wester Denoon ==References== Category:Villages in Angus ","title":"Glamis"},{"id":"1434153","text":"Laurence George Decore, (June 28, 1940 - November 6, 1999) was Canadian lawyer and politician from Alberta. He was of Ukrainian descent. He was mayor of Edmonton, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, and leader of the Alberta Liberal Party. == Early life == Decore was born Lavrentiy Dikur (Ukrainian: –õ–∞–≤—Ä–µ–Ω—Ç—ñ–π –î—ñ–∫—É—Ä) in Vegreville, Alberta on June 28, 1940, the son of future Liberal Party of Canada MP and judge John Decore (Ivan Dikur); while he was a child, the family Anglicized its name to \\"Decore.\\" He was educated in Vegreville, Edmonton, and Ottawa, and graduated from the University of Alberta in 1961 with B.A. in history and political economy, and in 1964 with an LL.B. He was called to the bar the year of his graduation, and eventually founded the firm Decore & Company. He married Anne Marie Decore (who later became the University of Alberta's Associate Vice President Academic), with whom he had two children, Michael and Andrea. Decore was involved in a number of business ventures that made him a millionaire. These included an Edmonton cable television station, a hotel in Jasper, and assorted other commercial enterprises. From 1973 until 1975 he was founding chairman of the Alberta Cultural Heritage Council. == Political career == === Municipal politics === Decore first sought office in the 1971 municipal election, when he ran for alderman in Ward 2. He finished fourth of eleven candidates; among those who defeated him was Cec Purves, against whom Decore would later run for mayor twice. He was elected as an alderman to Edmonton City Council in the 1974 election, in which he finished first of the ward's fourteen candidates. After serving a three-year term, he ran for mayor in 1977. He wound up nine thousand votes behind Purves, while finishing ahead of incumbent Terry Cavanagh‚Äîwho had been appointed interim mayor by city council after the death of William Hawrelak‚Äîand four other candidates. === Interval === Decore stayed out of electoral politics for the next six years, but was active in many community organizations. He was a member of the board of directors of the Canadian Foundation for Ukrainian Studies (1977‚Äì1981), president of the Ukrainian Canadian Professional and Business Federation (1979‚Äì1981), and chairman of the Canadian Consultative Council on Multiculturalism (1980‚Äì1983). It was in this last position he led a national lobby for a constitutional amendment acknowledging Canada's multicultural nature. The result was that he helped to draft Section 27 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. For this work he was awarded the Order of Canada. === Mayoralty === He returned to politics in the 1983 mayoral election when he defeated Purves in a landslide, more than doubling the incumbent's vote count and establishing a new historical plurality record. He was re-elected by a similar margin in 1986. As mayor, Decore eliminated the city's Board of Commissioners - handing more power to its elected city council - put in place a fiscal program that would eliminate the city's debt, took key major steps which began downtown revitalization and won a high-profile battle with the Province of Alberta over the city-owned telephone company's right to a fair share of long-distance revenue. He also oversaw the city's recovery after 1987's Edmonton Tornado and expressed the city's sadness over the Edmonton Oilers' trading Wayne Gretzky (the hockey team had won its first four Stanley Cups during Decore's time as mayor). On October 17, 1988 he resigned to enter provincial politics. === Provincial politics === As 1988 opened, the Alberta Liberal Party was led by Nick Taylor, who had served in this capacity since 1974. For most of those years, the party had been shut out of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta, but in the 1986 election it won its first four seats (including Taylor's) in more than a decade. This wasn't enough for some party faithful, however, and a 1987 leadership review resulted in a 1988 leadership convention (some have suggested that Decore helped orchestrate this result). Taylor contested the convention, as did Edmonton Meadowlark MLA Grant Mitchell, but Decore won a decisive first ballot victory. In the following year's snap election, he led the party to eight seats, twice as many as it had held at dissolution of the legislature, while also getting the second-highest popular vote, though the NDP retained official opposition status with 16 seats. Decore, who was elected in Edmonton-Glengarry, defeating New Democrat John Younie, declared \\"there is a new party on the horizon\\", as one of his candidates Percy Wickman had unseated Premier Don Getty. In the legislature, Decore focused his attacks in the government around fiscal responsibility and the province's rapidly rising debt. He was also critical of the government's involvement in the private sector which had, in some high-profile cases, resulted in companies defaulting on huge government loans. The Liberals rose rapidly in the polls, and Progressive Conservative Premier Don Getty resigned in 1992 rather than lead his party into another election that it might well lose. The Progressive Conservatives' new leader, Environment Minister and former Calgary mayor Ralph Klein, had won the leadership in part by making arguments similar to Decore's. He favoured a near-immediate balancing of the provincial budget and rapid debt repayment thereafter, and declared his government \\"out of the business of business\\". In the 1993 election, Decore therefore faced a Premier with whom he agreed on many issues; he coped by arguing that the Progressive Conservatives had, as a party, no moral authority left on the issues on which Klein was campaigning. The campaign was also notable as the former mayors of Edmonton and Calgary were facing off as party leaders. The Liberals won 32 of the province's 83 seats, the highest percentage they had won since leaving government in 1921 and the highest percentage won by any opposition party in the province's history. They returned to official opposition status for the first time since 1967, while banishing the New Democrats from the legislature. Decore now led the second-largest opposition caucus in the province's history. However, many Liberal MLAs and party members were unhappy to find themselves in the opposition after expecting to win power for the first time in more than 70 years. The disappointing results led to calls within the party for Decore to step down. Decore resigned his leadership in 1994, and did not seek re- election as MLA in the 1997 election. == Personal life, death, and legacy == After leaving politics, Decore returned to business and became chairman of the Canada-Ukraine Business Initiative. He was admitted to the Order of Canada in 1983, and received an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of Alberta in 1999. Decore was a two-time cancer survivor, having survived colon cancer in 1990 and liver cancer two years later, but a third incidence killed him in 1999. In paying tribute to him, Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien called Decore \\"an extraordinarily gifted leader\\" and \\"a man of vision and perseverance\\", while Klein said that he \\"brought great passion and a keen intellect to all he did in public life\\". Laurence Decore Lookout, a viewing point overlooking the North Saskatchewan River in Edmonton, is named in Decore's honour, as are the Edmonton Decore electoral district and the Laurence Decore Award for Student Leadership, a provincially endowed scholarship. == References == *Edmonton Public Library biography of Laurence Decore *City of Edmonton biography of Laurence Decore *Ukrainian Canadian Professional Business Federation memorial of Laurence Decore *Ukrainian Weekly obituary of Laurence Decore *Announcement of the Laurence Decore Awards for Student Leadership *CBC account of 1993 provincial election campaign Category:1940 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Alberta Liberal Party MLAs Category:Canadian people of Ukrainian descent Category:Deaths from cancer in Alberta Category:Edmonton city councillors Category:Lawyers in Alberta Category:Leaders of the Alberta Liberal Party Category:Mayors of Edmonton Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:University of Alberta alumni Category:20th-century Canadian lawyers Category:People from Vegreville ","title":"Laurence Decore"},{"id":"1434158","text":"was a Japanese martial artist. He is the founder of Isshin-ry≈´ (\\"One Heart Style\\") style of karate.) ==From childhood until World War II== ===Family=== Tatsuo Shimabukuro was born in Gushikawa village, Okinawa on September 19, 1908. He was the first of ten children born into a farming family. He began his study of karate at the age of 13 from his uncle, who lived a few miles away from him in Agena Village. His uncle initially sent him back home, but after seeing how dedicated his nephew was he took him on as a pupil. His uncle later sent him to study with Chotoku Kyan to further study karate because he thought Tatsuo's training was incomplete. Eizo Shimabukuro (b. 1925) was Tatsuo's younger brother, who also excelled in martial arts. Eizo studied under his elder brother, Tatsuo, and is said to have also studied under the same masters as Tatsuo, such as Chotoku Kyan, Chojun Miyagi, Choki Motobu, and Shinken Taira. While the older brother went on to create his own new style of karate, Eizo quickly moved up the ranks in Sh≈çrin-ry≈´ (Sh≈çbayashi). ===Learning years=== By the time Shimabukuro was a teenager, he had attained the physical level of a person six years his senior. His karate training, and work on the family farm, gave him physical strength. He excelled in athletic events on the island. By the time he was 17, he was consistently winning in two of his favorite events, the javelin throw and the high jump. Around the age of 19 (1927), he began to study Shorin-ryu karate under Chotoku Kyan at Kyan's home in the village of Yomitan. Kyan also taught at the Okinawa Prefectural Agricultural School. Within a short time, Shimabukuro became one of Kyan's best students and learned the kata: Seisan, Naihanchi, Wansu, Chinto and Kusanku, along with the weapons kata Tokumine nu kun and basic Sai. He also began his study of \\"Ki\\" (or \\"Chinkuchi; („ÉÅ„É≥„ÇØ„ÉÅ)\\" in the Okinawan dialect) for which Kyan was most well known. Shimabukuro studied with Kyan until 1939. Shimabukuro had always been fascinated by Naha-te karate (Goju Ryu) and sought out Chojun Miyagi, the founder of Goju Ryu. Miyagi's teacher had been Higaonna Kanryo (also called Higashionna) who brought from China a derivative of Kenpo (Êã≥Ê≥ï) called 'kin gai'. Pangai Noon was the bearer of Uechi-ryu from China to Okinawa. Eventually this became Naha-te. From Miyagi, Tatsuo learned Tensho, Seiunchin (\\"Seize-Control-Fight\\") kata and Sanchin (\\"Three-Fights/Conflicts\\") kata. Prior to studying with Miyagi, Shimabukuro, in 1942, sought out another famous Shorin-Ryu instructor, Choki Motobu, who was probably the most colorful of all of Shimabukuro's instructors. Motobu had had many teachers for short periods of time, including some notable ones such as Anko Itosu (Shuri-te), Sokon Matsumura, and Kosaku Matsumora (Tomari-te). Motobu was known for often getting into street fights in his youth to promote the effectiveness of karate. Shimabukuro studied with Motobu for approximately one year. Shimabukuro opened his first dojo in 1946 after the war in the village of Konbu, near Tengan village. ==From World War II until death== ===Turning point=== Coming from a farming family, Shimabukuro had always been poor, but he was very innovative and opportunistic. He had a natural talent for adapting things. As a young man in Kyan (Chan) („ÉÅ„É£„É≥) Village, he discovered a way to bind tiles to the roofs of homes without using mud, which had been the traditional way. During World War II, as part of the Boetai, he was forced to help construct the airfield in Kadena with his horses and carts. During the October 10, 1944 bombing raid by the Allied Forces, he lost his horses and carts. ===Practicing years=== Shimabukuro continued to study and develop his skills in both Shorin-Ryu and Goju-Ryu but he was not satisfied that either style held the completeness he was looking for. His interest in weapons (Kobudo) grew, and he sought out the most renowned weapons instructors, because he only knew the one bo (staff) kata, 'Tokumine no Kun' and basic sai techniques he had learned from Chotoku Kyan. He soon became a master in the Bo and Sai weapons. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, he continued his study of Kobud≈ç with one of Moden Yabiku's top students, Shinken Taira. This training took place in Shimabukuro's dojo in Agena. He learned Hama Higa nu Tuifa, Shishi nu Kun, Chatan Yara nu Sai, and Urashi Bo. Shimabuku created Kyan Chotoku nu Sai and Kusanku Sai using sai techniques he learned from Chotoku Kyan. To honor Chotoku Kyan, he named his first sai after him. However, Kyan nu Sai was replaced by 1960 with Kusanku Sai. ===Creative years=== During the late 1940s Shimabukuro began experimenting with different techniques and kata from the Shorin-Ryu and Goju-Ryu systems as well as Kobudo. He first called the style he was teaching Chan-migwa-te, after Chotoku Kyan's nickname Chan-migwa („ÉÅ„É£„É≥„Éü„Éº„Ç∞„ÉÆ„Éº). The nickname ‚ÄúChan-migwa‚Äù, meant ‚Äúsmall-eyed-Chan.\\" \\"Chan („ÉÅ„É£„É≥)\\", in the Okinawa dialect ‚ÄúUchinaguchi‚Äù, is ‚ÄúKyan (ÂñúÂ±ãÊ≠¶).\\" In Uchinaguchi ‚Äúmi („Éü„Éº)‚Äù means ‚Äúeye.\\" The suffix ‚ÄúGwa („Ç∞„ÉÆ„Éº)‚Äù or ‚ÄúGuwa („Ç∞„ÉÆ„Éº)‚Äù mean's ‚Äúsmall.‚Äù So Chan-migwa means ‚ÄúSmall-eyed Chan (Kyan)‚Äù. He renamed his Chan migwa-te style \\"Sun nu Su-te\\" in about 1947 after having trained with Chojun Miyagi \\"Isshin-ry≈´\\" on January 15, 1956. By the early 1950s Shimabukuro was refining his karate teaching, combining what he felt was the best of the Shorin-Ryu and Goju-Ryu styles, the weapons forms he had studied, and his own techniques. As his experimentation continued, his adaptation of techniques and kata were not widely publicized. He consulted with several of the masters on Okinawa about his wish to develop a new style. Because he was highly respected as a karate master, he received their blessings. These would later be rescinded due to the many radical changes made in traditional Okinawan karate. One night in 1955, Shimabukuro fell asleep and dreamed of the goddess Isshinryu no Megami (Goddess of Isshinryu). Three Stars appeared, symbolizing the three styles Isshin-ryu derived from, Goju-Ryu, Shorin-Ryu, and Kobudo. The stars might also have represented the Physical, Mental, and Spiritual strength needed for Isshin-ryu. The gray evening sky symbolized serenity, and implied that karate was to be used only for self- defense. The next morning when Shimabukuro awoke, he felt that his dream had been a divine revelation. On January 15, 1956, he met with his students and told them he was starting a new style of karate. Upon announcing his decision to start a new style, many of his Okinawan students left, including his brother Eizo. The emblem of Isshinryu no Megami was drawn from Shimabukuro's description by Shosu Nakamine, Eiko Kaneshi's uncle, and was chosen to be the symbol for Isshin-ry≈´ karate. During his career, Shimabukuro changed his name to ‚ÄúTatsuo,‚Äù meaning ‚ÄúDragon Man.‚Äù Whenever asked about this change, Shimabukuro would reply that ‚ÄúTatsuo‚Äù was his professional karate name. He also was given the nickname, ‚ÄúSun nu su‚Äù, by the mayor of Kyan (Chan) Village. Sun nu su was a name of a dance that was created by Shimabukuro's grandfather. ===Teaching years=== In 1955, the Third Marine Division of the U.S. Marine Corps was stationed on Okinawa, and the Marine Corps chose Shimabukuro to provide instruction to Marines on the island. As a result of his instruction, Isshin-ry≈´ was spread throughout the United States by returning Marines. The karate that the Marines brought back to dojos in the United States was a blend of what Shimabukuro considered the best of the karate systems. The first of the Marines to bring Isshin-ry≈´ karate to the United States were Don Nagle and Harold Long. Nagle opened his dojo outside Camp Lejeune, North Carolina in late 1957, while Harold Long's first dojo was in his backyard at Twenty-Nine Palms, California in late 1958. Upon their discharge from service, Nagle moved to Jersey City, New Jersey, and opened the first Isshin-ry≈´ dojo in the Northeast. Harold Long returned home to Knoxville, Tennessee, and opened his first dojo at the Marine Reserve Training Center. Returning later were Harold Mitchum, Sherman Harill, Steve Armstrong, Ed Johnson, Walter Van Gilson, Clarence Ewing, George Breed, Jim Advincula, Bill Gardo, and Harry Smith and others. George Breed began teaching Isshin-ry≈´ Karate in Atlanta, Georgia in 1961, and then, in Gainesville, Florida from 1966-1969. He remained independent of the Association. In 1960, the Okinawan-American Karate Association was formed, with Harold Mitchum as the association's first president. The name of the association was changed to the American-Okinawan Karate Association due to an error at the print shop. Shimabukuro made only two trips to the United States to visit his many military students. The first, was to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1964 from September to late November, sponsored by James Morabeto and William Duessel. During his 1966 trip, he visited Steve Armstrong in Tacoma, Washington, Harold Long in Knoxville, Tennessee, Donald Nagle in Jersey City, New Jersey, and Harry Acklin in Cleveland, Ohio. Armstrong, Long, and Nagle were promoted to the rank of Hachi-Dan (Eighth Degree) during this visit, and each of these men became a driving force in the promotion and spread of Isshin-ry≈´ karate in the United States. Shimabukuro was known to not enjoy traveling far from home. Any further visits representing him were conducted by his student and son-in-law, Angi Uezu. Another important event took place during this trip. While visiting the dojo of Steve Armstrong (1966), Shimabukuro was filmed performing all 14 Isshin-ryu kata as well as some basic exercise and self-defense techniques. Copies of this film were circulated among the top instructors. It is believed that Shimabukuro did not want to be filmed, and that the recording does not represent a true expression of the various kata. Shimabukuro continued teaching at his dojo in Agena until his retirement in early 1972. He passed his legacy over to his son, Kichiro Shimabukuro, Eiko Kaneshi was also considered for this honor. ==Death== Shimabukuro died from a stroke at his home in the village of Agena on May 30, 1975 at the age of 66. ==Modifications from traditional forms== Some of his modifications to karate are: * The Sunsu kata: a kata exclusive to Isshin-ryu, Sunsu consists mostly of techniques from other kata that Tatsuo found useful and important. * Reversing the Naihanchi kata, going left first, rather than right. NOTE: The Tomari Naihanchi starts in this fashion so Tatsuo did not change this. ==Legacy== Some call him a non- traditionalist, but he had a foot in both worlds. Some kata were modified for use with shoes but his students still trained barefoot when outdoors. Often techniques were taught differently on different days. Once Shimabukuro was sitting drinking awamori with some students. He asked them while pointing toward some bottles \\"which bottle is best\\"? Some picked the larger bottles, some the smaller. Tatsuo said that the shape of the bottle was not important. He indicated all bottles were good, that there was no \\"best bottle\\" and that all bottles served a purpose. In 1980, Shimabukuro was the first person inducted into the International Isshin-ryu Karate Association's Isshin-ry≈´ Hall of Fame. ==References== Category:Okinawan male karateka Category:Martial arts school founders Category:1908 births Category:1975 deaths Category:G≈çj≈´- ry≈´ practitioners ","title":"Tatsuo Shimabuku"},{"id":"1434164","text":"Michael Lee Ivins (born March 17, 1963 in Omaha, Nebraska) is the bassist, keyboardist, backing vocalist and one of the founding members of The Flaming Lips.

It was created in 1951 by trucking firm purchaser J. Richard Seitz (1915-1992).Franz Lidz, \\"Apba Is The Name, Baseball Is The Game, And Obsession Is The Result\\", Sports Illustrated, Dec. 8, 1980 The acronym stands for \\"American Professional Baseball Association\\", the name of a board game league Seitz devised in 1931 with eight high school classmates.\\"Deaths\\", The Washington Post, Sept. 28, 1992 After World War II, he formed APBA Game Co., working out of his living room.\\"Apba Game Founder Dies\\", The Morning Call, Sept. 27, 1992 In 2011, after 60 years in Pennsylvania, the company headquarters was moved to Alpharetta, Georgia. The company's first offering was a baseball simulation table game using cards to represent each major league player, boards to represent different on-base scenarios (e.g. \\"Bases Empty\\", \\"Runners on First and Third,\\" \\"Bases Loaded\\"), and dice to generate random numbers. Seitz's mail-order product derived from the game National Pastime, invented and patented by Clifford Van Beek in 1925, a game that Seitz played in his youth. The game can be played against another person or solitaire. Devoted fans keep track of the results and assess how players' performances compare to their real-life statistics. The game company later produced football, golf, basketball, hockey, bowling, boxing, soccer, and saddle racing games modeled after the baseball game (cards, boards, and dice). In the 1980s and 1990s, computer adaptations of some of these games were produced. APBA enthusiasts have included Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush; presidential son-in-law David Eisenhower; New York mayor Ed Koch; actor Jeff Daniels;Soren Narnia, \\"roll! they cried\\" ballplayers Bump Wills, Jim Sundberg and Dave Magadan; sports agent and Detroit Pistons vice chairman Arn Tellem; and journalist and memoirist Franz Lidz.Franz Lidz, \\"Scorecard\\", Sports Illustrated, April 9, 2001 For much of its history APBA's main competitor has been Strat-O-Matic. Other rivals include, or have included, Replay Publishing, Statis Pro Baseball, MLB Showdown and, in APBA's early years, Big League Manager. In 2000 APBA redesigned the packaging of its baseball game and for a brief time expanded its marketing approach to include hobby shops and sport card dealers, with limited success. == Computer versions of the baseball game == In 1984, the game company authorized a computer version of an advanced \\"master\\" version of their baseball game. It was published by Random House in 1985, first for PC computers and later for Apple. McGraw-Hill became the publisher after the company acquired Random House's software division in 1989, and the original game developers, Miller Associates, took over publishing and sales in 1990. In 1993, Miller and APBA announced a version of the game for the Windows platform, and it came out that summer. It received a perfect 10 out of 10 score from Electronic Entertainment. Titled APBA Presents Baseball for Windows (with the first two words in small print), Miller continued to update and publish the game software; their final version, 5.5, came out in the summer of 1999. Late in 2000, APBA announced that it had agreed to take over sales and service for the game; Miller Associates disbanded. In February 2007 the APBA Game Company announced that they had acquired the rights to the Baseball for Windows code, and planned an upgrade to be released in the fall of 2008, featuring the voice of Pete Van Wieren, replacing the earlier editions' Ernie Harwell. Complications in game development, as well as errors in the code that had gone long unrepaired, delayed the release. As of November 2011, the current release schedule has not been announced. The current version of the game runs on Windows 7 in 32-bit mode. For 64 bit versions of Windows 7, it requires Virtual Mode software. Some APBA players maintain computers with older versions of Windows solely for running the APBA software. In August 2012, APBA released an updated version of Baseball for Windows 5.5, called APBA Computer Baseball version 5.75. The game came with 3 complete major league seasons(1921, 1961, and 2011). This release was updated again in 2015 with the seasons included changed to 1957, 1976, and 2014. Game players can order additional disks individually for all major league seasons from 1901 through the present, with other special disks also available. ===Reception=== Computer Gaming World in 1992 criticized aspects of version 1.5's interface, but praised the sophistication of the MicroManager module's BaseballTalk language for creating custom managers for simulated games. The magazine called APBA \\"a work in progress, an impressive baseball park under construction ... but for what it delivers today, at the price asked, APBA Baseball would not be my first choice\\". Computer Gaming World in 1993 approved of the \\"gorgeous\\" ballparks, sophisticated drafting and statistical options, and \\"easy-to-use interface\\" of APBA Presents: Baseball for Windows. The magazine concluded that the developers should \\"be congratulated for making a true Windows product\\", with \\"realistic representation of baseball\\". APBA Baseball for Windows was a finalist for Computer Gaming Worlds Sports Game of the Year award, losing to Front Page Sports Football Pro. The editors wrote that despite new graphics \\"it is still the statistical model and replay accuracy of this new game, like its venerable ancestor, that command's everyone's attention\\". == Conventions and tournaments == APBA continues to have a devoted following, with conventions now held every year under the game company's sponsorship. The highlight of the convention is a tournament played by the attendees. APBA conventions go back as far as June 1973, when more than 300 fans got together in Philadelphia for a convention sponsored by the game's independent publication, the APBA Journal. The convention tournament was won by Robert Weeks. A record 650 got together in New York City in June 1975, with Barry Koopersmith the tournament winner. The third and final APBA Journal convention was held in June 1976 in Philadelphia, with Richard Beggs winning the tournament. The tournament structure for those conventions allowed participants to construct a team from all the cards they owned. (The Journal continued to be published under different management until 2002, but never held another convention.) Conventions resumed in Lancaster in July 1995 under game company sponsorship. The tournament was limited to stock teams that finished with percentages between .480 and .515. Chris Dineen's 1982 Expos prevailed. The June 1998 tournament, held in nearby Millersville, was limited to teams with percentages below .550. Ten-year-old Devin Flawd won, using the 1995 Mariners. Conventions have been held annually beginning in 2001. All except 2003 were sponsored by the game company. The limits on team winning percentages were dropped after 2002. The 2013 convention was held near the new corporate offices in Georgia; it was unique in that it produced the first back-to-back tournament winner. In addition, Brian Wells, a two-time winner himself, was inducted into the APBA Hall of Fame along with his father, Greg Wells. ==Convention tournament results== Year - Location - Winner - Team * 1999 - Mini-Camp Lancaster, PA - Karl Hasselbarth - 1975 Giants * 2001 - Lancaster, PA - Paul Cunningham - 1976 Athletics * 2002 - Lancaster, PA - Brian Wells#* - 2000 Diamondbacks * 2003 - Lancaster, PA - Todd Davis - 1977 Royals** def.

David Andrews (born 1933) is an Irish astronomer. He studied at Oriel College Oxford and University of Dublin. He spent the early 1960s in Denmark working with the astrophysicist M. Rudkjobing at the Aarhus Observatory. He moved on in 1963 to Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland where he spent the next 35 years. Dr Andrews discovered the minor planet 1727 Mette (named after Andrews' Danish wife) whilst at the Boyden Observatory located in Bloemfontein, South Africa, where he was Acting Director. It was while at Boyden Observatory that he commenced his lifelong work on flare stars.Nine flares of YZ CMi Publ. Astron. Soc. Pacific vol.78, p.324 (1966) He was the first to make full use of computers, in 1968, at Armagh Observatory. Andrews was Editor of the Irish Astronomical Journal following Ernst √ñpik, and in 1967 became a founder member of Commission 27 Working Group on Flare Stars of the International Astronomical Union. The Boyden Station was created by Harvard University in 1889 in Arequipa, Peru, using Uriah A. Boyden's bequest to Harvard. In 1927 the renamed Boyden Observatory moved across continents to its present location in South Africa. This became the site of the Armagh-Dunsink- Harvard 36-inch Baker-Schmidt telescope utilized by Dr.E.M.Lindsay (Harvard & Armagh) and other Irish and international astronomers. In 1976 the Observatory was handed over to the University of the Orange Free State and the famous ADH telescope was dismantled. Some of its optical parts, including a 32-inch prism, were transferred to Dunsink Observatory, Dublin. Andrews then turned his attention to the new international astronomical facilities in Chile, and to available satellite technologies. Whilst 1727 Mette is by no means unique, it has been found that it belongs to the Hungaria family of asteroids which cross the orbit of Mars, and that it has a small companion orbiting it once every 21 days. This update comes from the Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado Springs U.S.A. Asteroid 1727 Mette is 10 kilometers in diameter and rotates on its axis with a period of 2.98 hours. Its companion is about 2 kilometers in diameter. It has been suggested recently that 1727 Mette could make a close encounter with Mars in 2023, perhaps even a collision.Warner B.D. & Stephens R.D., Bull. Minor Planet Section LPO, 40, p.129 (2013) This impact scenario sounds very much like that on Earth 65 million years ago when our dinosaurs were destroyed. In the Irish Astronomical Journal Andrews reportedIrish Astronomical Journal vol.6, p.212 (1964) and vol.23, p.189 (1996) a suspected outburst of a B7 spectral type star in Auriga, BD +31 1048. This enigmatic object was referred to by Prof.G.Haro as \\"Andrews' Star\\".Nebulae & Interstellar Matter, Stars & Stellar Systems Vol.VII eds Middlehurst & Aller, Chicago. p.142 (1968)Burnham, R. Celestial Handbook, Vol.1. Dover Press, London (1979). This was a discovery made in his earliest work on flare stars and solar-related phenomena which he pioneered at Armagh Observatory. Andrews collaborated with several groups in U.K., U.S.A., especially with Dr.D.J.Mullan (Armagh & Bartol Research Inst.), and S.America, Russia, Armenia, Italy and Greece. He cooperated with Prof.G.Haro, director at the Tonantzintla Observatory in Mexico on stellar flares in young stellar clusters. Collaboration with Dr.W.E.Kunkel (Univ.Texas) and Sir Bernard Lovell at the Jodrell Bank radio telescope led to one of the earliest detections of large radio flares in UV Ceti-type stars, in the dMe star YZ CMi.Lovell.

What Andrews had fortuitously observed at Armagh in 1968 turns out to have been what is now termed a stellar megaflare (also see Apache Point Observatory). In 1981 Andrews published from the Armagh Observatory his multi-colour (UBVI) measurements of over 16000 stars in a region rich in flare stars on Schmidt photographic plates, \\"A Photometric Atlas of the Orion Nebula\\". He used material from the SRC/UK Schmidt in Australia and the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and the Las Campanas Observatory (Univ. Toronto) in Chile. In the Irish Astronomical Journal he published a \\"Cyclopaedia of Telescope Makers\\" in seven parts in the 1990s.Irish Astronomical Journal 20, p.102 (1992), 21, p.1 (1993), 21, p.167 (1995), 22,p.43 (1995), 23, p.57 (1996), 23 p.215 (1996), 24, p.125 (1997),25, p.95 (1998) From 1984 he was actively engaged in the search for quasi-periodic ultraviolet and infrared variations in flare stars indicative of active regions and stellar rotation.Astronomy & Astrophysics 210, p.303 (1989), 214,p.220 (1989), 227, p.456 (1990), 229, p.504 (1990), 234, p.264 (1990), 239, p.235 (1990), 245, p.219 (1991)Andrews A.D. & Panagi P.

Although the term liturgy is used to mean public worship in general, the Byzantine Rite uses the term \\"Divine Liturgy\\" to denote the Eucharistic service.Mother Mary and Ware, Kallistos Timothy, Festal Menaion (3rd printing, 1998), St. Tikhon's Seminary Press, p. 555, It often but not exclusively occurs on Sunday, or Saturday in the case of those churches practicing seventh-day Sabbatarianism. Liturgy is the gathering together of Christians to be taught the 'Word of God' (the Christian Bible) and encouraged in their faith. In most Christian traditions, liturgies are presided over by clergy wherever possible. ==Partial list of Christian liturgical rites== Different Christian traditions have employed different rites: ===Western Christian churches=== ====Latin Catholic Church==== *Roman Rite, in which the historical forms of the Mass are usually classified as follows: **Pre-Tridentine Mass (the various pre-1570 forms) **The Tridentine Mass (1570‚Äì1969), the 1962 version of which is still permitted as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite as confirmed by Summorum Pontificum **The Mass of Paul VI, since 1970 the ordinary form of the Roman Rite (1970‚Äìpresent) **Anglican Use, (in personal ordinariates and Anglican Use parishes) *Ambrosian Rite (in Milan, Italy and neighbouring areas) *Aquileian Rite (defunct: northeastern Italy) *Rite of Braga (in Braga, Portugal) *Durham Rite (defunct: Durham, England) *Gallican Rite (defunct: 'Gaul' i.e. France) *Mozarabic Rite (in Toledo and Salamanca, Spain) *Celtic Rite (defunct: British Isles) *Sarum Rite (defunct: England) *Catholic Order Rites (generally defunct) ** Benedictine Rite ** Carmelite Rite ** Carthusian Rite ** Cistercian Rite ** Dominican Rite ** Norbertine Rite ====Protestant churches==== While some Protestant churches see no need for set liturgies, many of these churches have retained them. Reformed churches Protestant Reformation-era ministers of the Reformed tradition used set liturgies which emphasized preaching and the Bible. English Puritans and separatists moved away from set forms in the 17th-century, but many Reformed churches retained liturgies and continue to use them today. Lutheran churches *Church of Denmark *Church of Norway *Church of Sweden *Church of Finland *Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Slovakia *Slovak Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Serbia *Evangelical Lutheran Church in America *Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod *Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod **Divine Service Anglican Communion At the time of English Reformation, The Sarum Rite was in use along with the Roman Rite. Reformers in England wanted the Latin mass translated into the English language. Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer authored the Exhortation and Litany in 1544. This was the earliest English- language service book of the Church of England, and the only English-language service to be finished within the lifetime of King Henry VIII.F Procter & W. H. Frere, A New History of the Book of Common Prayer (Macmillan, 1905) p. 31. In 1549, Cranmer produced a complete English-language liturgy. Cranmer was largely responsible for the first two editions of the Book of Common Prayer. The first edition was predominantly pre-Reformation in its outlook. The Communion Service, Lectionary, and collects in the liturgy were translations based on the Sarum Rite as practised in Salisbury Cathedral. The revised edition in 1552 sought to assert a more clearly Protestant liturgy after problems arose from conservative interpretation of the mass on the one hand, and a critique by Martin Bucer (Butzer) on the other. Successive revisions are based on this edition, though important alterations appeared in 1604 and 1662. The 1662 edition is still authoritative in the Church of England and has served as the basis for many of Books of Common Prayer of national Anglican churches around the world. Those deriving from Scottish Episcopal descent, like the Prayer Books of the American Episcopal Church, have a slightly different liturgical pedigree. *Book of Common Prayer *Exhortation and Litany (1544) Methodist churches The United Methodist liturgical tradition is based on the Anglican heritage and was passed along to Methodists by John Wesley (an Anglican priest who led the early Methodist revival) who wrote that When the Methodists in America were separated from the Church of England, John Wesley himself provided a revised version of the Book of Common Prayer called the The Sunday Service of the Methodists. Wesley's Sunday Service has shaped the official liturgies of the Methodists ever since. The United Methodist Church has official liturgies for services of Holy Communion, baptism, weddings, funerals, ordination, anointing of the sick for healing, and daily office \\"praise and prayer\\" services. Along with these, there are also special services for holy days such as All Saints Day, Ash Wednesday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter Vigil. All of these liturgies and services are contained in The United Methodist Hymnal and The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992).2008 Book of Discipline paragraph 1114.3 Many of these liturgies are derived from the Anglican tradition's Book of Common Prayer. In most cases, congregations also use other elements of liturgical worship, such as candles, vestments, paraments, banners, and liturgical art. ===United and Uniting churches=== ====Church of South India==== The liturgy of the Church of South India combines many traditions, including that of the Methodists and such smaller churches as the Church of the Brethren and the Disciples of Christ. After the formation of the Church of South India the first synod met at Madurai in March 1948 and appointed a liturgical committee. The first Synod in 1948 (where the Holy Communion service was that of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland) appointed a liturgy committee, composed mainly of Western theologians. The liturgy so prepared was first used at the Synod Session in 1950 and approved for use throughout the church \\"wherever it is desired\\" in 1954. The first version of the Confirmation Service for the new church was also released in 1950, translated into regional languages and was quickly adopted by the various dioceses. By 1962 the Liturgy Committee was able to prepare a number of Orders. They were Eucharist, Morning and Evening Prayer, Marriage Service, Burial Service, Ordination Service and Covenant Service (1954), Holy Baptism (1955) and Almanac (1955‚Äì56). The Book of Common Worship of the CSI was published in 1963 with all the above orders of service. The orders of service consist of: Order for Morning and Evening Worship, Order of Service for the Baptized Persons, Order for Holy Baptism, Order for the Churching of Women, Order for Holy Matrimony, Order for the Burial Service, Order for the Covenant Service, Order for Ordination Services. The CSI liturgy was again revised in the year 2004 and published as a hardback book in 2006. The CSI Synod Liturgical Committee has developed several new orders for worship for different occasions. The order for the Communion Service, known as the CSI Liturgy, has been internationally acclaimed as an important model for new liturgies. The Committee has also produced three different cycles of lectionaries for daily Bible readings and \\"propers\\", and collects for Communion services. In addition, the Committee has also brought out a Supplement to the Book of Common Worship. ===Eastern Christian churches=== ====Eastern Orthodox Church==== *Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Byzantine Rite) *Divine Liturgy of St. Basil the Great (Byzantine Rite) *Liturgy of St. James (Byzantine Rite) *Liturgy of St. Mark (Byzantine Rite) *Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts or Liturgy of St. Gregory Dialogist (Byzantine Rite) *Liturgy of St. Tikhon (Western Rite Orthodox) *Liturgy of St. Gregory (Western Rite Orthodox) *Liturgy of St. John The Divine (Western Rite Orthodox) *Liturgy of St. Germanus (Western Rite Orthodox) ====Oriental Orthodox Churches==== *Liturgy of St. James (West Syriac Rite) *Liturgy of St. Mark, or Liturgy of St. Cyril (Alexandrian Rite) *Liturgy of St. Basil the Great (Alexandrian & Armenian Rites) *Liturgy of St. Gregory the Theologian (Alexandrian Rite) *Liturgy of St. Gregory the Illuminator (Armenian Rite) ====Assyrian Church of the East==== *Liturgy of Addai and Mari (East Syriac Rite) *The Hallowing of Nestorius *The Hallowing of Theodore of Mopsuestia ====The Eastern Catholic Churches==== *Alexandrian liturgical tradition; 2 rites **Coptic Rite **Ethiopic Rite *Antiochian (Antiochene or West-Syriac) liturgical tradition; 3 rites **Maronite Rite **(West) Syriac Rite **Syro- Malankara Rite *Armenian Rite; 1 rite *East Syriac or Chaldean liturgical tradition; 2 rites **Chaldean Rite **Syro-Malabar Rite *Byzantine (Constantinopolitan) liturgical tradition (very uniform except in language); 14 rites **Albanian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Greek, Hungarian, Italo- Albanian, Macedonian, Melkite, Romanian, Russian, Ruthenian, Slovak, Ukrainian Rite ==Details of Western liturgy== ===Frequent practice=== The Roman Catholic Mass is the service in which the Eucharist is celebrated. In Latin, the corresponding word is Missa, taken from the dismissal at the end of the liturgy - Ite, Missa est, literally \\"Go, it is the dismissal\\", translated idiomatically in the current English Roman Missal as \\"Go forth, the Mass is ended.\\" Eastern Orthodox churches call this service the Divine Liturgy. Oriental Orthodox call their Liturgy the Holy Qurbana - Holy Offering. Anglicans often use the Roman Catholic term mass, or simply Holy Eucharist. Mass is the common term used in the Lutheran Church in Europe but more often referred to as the Divine Service, Holy Communion, or the Holy Eucharist in North American Lutheranism. Lutherans retained and utilized much of the Roman Catholic mass since the early modifications by Martin Luther. The general order of the mass and many of the various aspects remain similar between the two traditions. Latin titles for the sections, psalms, and days has been widely retained, but more recent reforms have omitted this. Recently, Lutherans have adapted much of their revised mass to coincide with the reforms and language changes brought about by post-Vatican II changes. Protestant traditions vary in their liturgies or \\"orders of worship\\" (as they are commonly called). Other traditions in the west often called \\"Mainline\\" have benefited from the Liturgical Movement which flowered in the mid/late 20th Century. Over the course of the past several decades, these Protestant traditions have developed remarkably similar patterns of liturgy, drawing from ancient sources as the paradigm for developing proper liturgical expressions. Of great importance to these traditions has been a recovery of a unified pattern of Word and Sacrament in Lord's Day liturgy. Many other Protestant Christian traditions (such as the Pentecostal/Charismatics, Assembly of God, and Non-denominational churches), while often following a fixed \\"order of worship\\", tend to have liturgical practices that vary from that of the broader Christian tradition. ===Other offices=== Matins is generally said in the morning, independently of the Eucharist. Vespers are prayers generally said in the evening, independently of the Eucharist. Matins and Vespers are the two main prayer times of Christian churches, and are also called Morning and Evening Prayer. In the Catholic Church, these two offices are part of a series of prayer hours, called the Liturgy of the Hours, the Canonical Hours, the Divine Office, the Roman Breviary, and other names.Fernand Cabrol, \\"Divine Office\\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1911) There were eight such hours, corresponding to certain times of the day: Matins (sometimes called Vigil), Lauds, Prime, Terce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline. The Second Vatican Council ordered the suppression of Prime.Second Vatican Council, Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, Sacrosanctum Concilium, 89 d In monasteries, Matins was generally celebrated before dawn, or sometimes over the course of a night; Lauds at the end of Matins, generally at the break of day; Prime at 6 AM; Terce at 9AM; Sext at noon; None at 3PM; Vespers at the rising of the Vespers or Evening Star (usually about 6PM); and Compline was said at the end of the day, generally right before bed time. In Anglican churches, the offices were combined into two offices: Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer, the latter sometimes known as Evensong. In more recent years, the Anglicans have added the offices of Noonday and Compline to Morning and Evening Prayer as part of the Book of Common Prayer. The Anglican Breviary, containing 8 full offices, is not the official liturgy of the Anglican Church. In Lutheranism, like Anglicanism, the offices were also combined into the two offices of Matins and Vespers (both of which are still maintained in modern Lutheran prayer books and hymnals). A common practice among Lutherans in America is to pray these offices mid-week during Advent and Lent. The office of Compline is also found in some older Lutheran worship books and more typically used in monasteries and seminaries. The Byzantine Rite maintains a daily cycle of seven non- sacramental services: * Vespers (Gk. Hesperinos) at sunset commences the liturgical day * Compline (Gk. Apodeipnou, \\"after supper\\") * Midnight Office (Gk. mesonyktikon) * Matins (Gk. Orthros), ending at dawn (in theory; in practice, the time varies greatly) * The First Hour * The Third and Sixth Hours * The Ninth Hour The sundry Canonical Hours are, in practice, grouped together into aggregates so that there are three major times of prayer a day: Evening, Morning and Midday; for details, see Canonical hours ‚Äî Aggregates. Great Vespers as it is termed in the Byzantine Rite, is an extended vespers service used on the eve of a major Feast day, or in conjunction with the divine liturgy, or certain other special occasions. ===Commonalities=== There are common elements found in most Western liturgical churches which predate the Protestant Reformation. These include: *The Procession with the cross, followed by the other acolytes, the deacons and the priest *The Invocation (beginning with the Sign of the Cross) *Confession at the foot of the altar *Absolution *Introit, Psalms, Hymns, chants *Litany *Kyrie and Gloria *Salutation *Collect *Liturgical Readings (call and response) *Alleluia Verse and other responses Scripture readings at Gereja Santa, Indonesia *Scripture readings, culminating in a reading from one of the Gospels. *The Creed *The Prayers *The Lord's Prayer *Commemoration of the Saints and prayers for the faithful departed. *Intercessory prayers for the church and its leadership, and often, for earthly rulers. *Incense *Offering *A division between the first half of the liturgy, open to both Church members and those wanting to learn about the church, and the second half, the celebration of the Eucharist proper, open only to baptized believers in good standing with the church. * The Consecration * The Offertory Prayer *Communion *Sanctus prayer as part of the anaphora *A three-fold dialogue between priest and people at the beginning of the anaphora or eucharistic prayer *An anaphora, eucharistic canon, \\"great thanksgiving\\", canon or \\"hallowing\\", said by the priest in the name of all present, in order to consecrate the bread and wine as the Body and Blood of Christ. *With one exception, that of Addai and Mari, all of the extant anaphoras incorporate some form of Jesus' words over the bread and wine at the Last Supper: \\"This is my body\\" over the bread and, over the wine, \\"This is my blood.\\" *A prayer to God the Father, usually invoking the Holy Spirit, asking that the bread and wine become, or be manifested as, the body and blood of Christ. *Expressions within the anaphora which indicate that sacrifice is being offered in remembrance of Christ's crucifixion. *A section of the anaphora which asks that those who receive communion may be blessed thereby, and often, that they may be preserved in the faith until the end of their lives *The Peace or \\"Passing of the Peace\\" *Agnus Dei *Benediction ==See also== *Anglican devotions *List of Catholic rites and churches *Apostolic Tradition ==Notes== ==Further reading== * Reed, Luther D.

It can be viewed as part of a power structure, in which it is usually seen as the most vulnerable and also the most powerful part. ==Military chain of command== In a military context, the chain of command is the line of authority and responsibility along which orders are passed within a military unit and between different units. In more simple terms, the chain of command is the succession of leaders through which command is exercised and executed. Orders are transmitted down the chain of command, from a responsible superior, such as a commissioned officer, to lower-ranked subordinate(s) who either execute the order personally or transmit it down the chain as appropriate, until it is received by those expected to execute it. \\"Command is exercised by virtue of office and the special assignment of members of the Armed Forces holding military rank who are eligible to exercise command.\\" In general, military personnel give orders only to those directly below them in the chain of command and receive orders only from those directly above them. A service member who has difficulty executing a duty or order and appeals for relief directly to an officer above his immediate commander in the chain of command is likely to be disciplined for not respecting the chain of command. Similarly, an officer is usually expected to give orders only to his or her direct subordinate(s), even if only to pass an order down to another service member lower in the chain of command than said subordinate. The concept of chain of command also implies that higher rank alone does not entitle a higher-ranking service member to give commands to anyone of lower rank. For example, an officer of unit \\"A\\" does not directly command lower- ranking members of unit \\"B\\", and is generally expected to approach an officer of unit \\"B\\" if he requires action by members of that unit. The chain of command means that individual members take orders from only one superior and only give orders to a defined group of people immediately below them. If an officer of unit \\"A\\" does give orders directly to a lower-ranked member of unit \\"B\\", it would be considered highly unusual (a faux pas, or extraordinary circumstances, such as a lack of time or inability to confer with the officer in command of unit \\"B\\") as officer \\"A\\" would be seen as subverting the authority of the officer of unit \\"B\\". Depending on the situation or the standard procedure of the military organization, the lower-ranked member being ordered may choose to carry out the order anyway, or advise that it has to be cleared with his or her own chain of command first, which in this example would be with officer \\"B\\". Refusal to carry out an order is almost always considered insubordination; the only exception usually allowed is if the order itself is illegal (i.e., the person carrying out the order would be committing an illegal act). (See Superior Orders.) In addition, within combat units, line officers are in the chain of command, but staff officers in specialist fields (such as medical, dental, legal, supply, and chaplain) are not, except within their own specialty. For example, a medical officer in an infantry battalion would be responsible for the combat medics in that unit but would not be eligible to command the battalion or any of its subordinate units. The term is also used in a civilian management context describing comparable hierarchical structures of authority. Such structures are included in Fire Departments, Police Departments and other organizations that have a paramilitary command or power structure. ==Sociology== In sociology, command hierarchy is seen as the most visible element of a \\"power network.\\" In this model, social capital is viewed as being mobilized in response to orders that move through the hierarchy leading to the phrase \\"command and control\\".usacac.army.mil ===Features=== Regardless of the degree of control or results achieved, and regardless of how the hierarchy is justified and rationalized, certain aspects of a command hierarchy tend to be similar: * rank ‚Äì especially military rank ‚Äì \\"who outranks whom\\" in the power structure * unity of command ‚Äì each member of the hierarchy has one and only one superior, precluding possibility of contradictory orders * strict accountability ‚Äì those who issue orders are responsible for the consequences, not those who carry them out * strict feedback rules ‚Äì complaints go up the hierarchy to those with power to deal with them, not down to those who do not have that power * detailed rules for decision making ‚Äì what criteria apply and when * standardized language and terminology * some ethics and key beliefs in common, usually enforced as early as recruiting and screening of recruits ===Problems=== However, people of such compatible views often have similar systemic biases because they are from the same culture. Such problems as groupthink or willingness to accept one standard of evidence internal to the group, but require drastically higher evidence from outside, are common. In part to address these problems, much modern management science has focused on reducing reliance on command hierarchy especially for information flow, since the cost of communications is now low, and the cost of management mistakes is higher. It is also easier to replace managers, so they have a personal interest in more distributed responsibility and perhaps more consensus decision making. Ubiquitous command and control posits for military organizations, a generalisation from hierarchies to networks which allows for the use of hierarchies when they are appropriate, and non-hierarchical networks when they are inappropriate. This includes the notion of mission agreement, to support \\"edge in\\" as well as \\"top-down\\" flow of intent. ==See also== * Control (management) * Command (military formation) * Hierarchical organization * Incident Command System * Command and control * Military rank * Directive control ==References== Category:Military life Category:Military organization Category:Networks Category:Command and control ","title":"Command hierarchy"},{"id":"1434226","text":"Trautfetter, Rudolf Ernestovich Ernst Rudolf von Trautvetter (20 February 1809, in Jelgava ‚Äì 24 January 1889, in St. Petersburg), was a Baltic German botanist, specialising in the flora of the Caucasus and central Asia.

Set in the small town of Adenville, Utah, between 1896 and 1898, the stories are loosely based on Fitzgerald's childhood experiences. Chronicled by the first-person voice of John Dennis Fitzgerald, the stories mainly center on the escapades of John's mischievous older brother, Tom Dennis Fitzgerald, a.k.a. \\"The Great Brain\\". The Great Brain was made into a movie released in 1978, with the main character played by Jimmy Osmond.\\"The Great Brain (1978),\\" Internet Movie Database. Accessed Aug. 2, 2018. Mercer Mayer originally illustrated the books, except for 1995's The Great Brain Is Back (which was illustrated by Diane deGroat). Mayer did the original cover illustrations for the first seven books as well, but Carl Cassler re-did the cover illustrations for some of the reprints of the first seven books. ==Background == Although John D. Fitzgerald was born in Price, Utah, several references in the stories suggest Adenville is located in Utah's \\"Dixie\\" in the southwestern corner of the state. A small village called Adenville briefly existed near Cedar City, about which little is known. The publisher's note in The Great Brain Is Back, published after the death of the author, recounts the story of the series' origin. Papa Married a Mormon and its sequel, Mama's Boarding House, were published in 1955 and 1958 respectively. Those books were set in Adenville, Utah, at the end of the 19th century. A third book was requested by the editor, E.L. Doctorow, but he changed jobs before the manuscript was completed. Fitzgerald submitted the new novel, which focused on the children of Adenville, to Doctorow at The Dial Press but by then family stories were out of favor with adult readers. The new editor for children's books offered to publish the novel if it were cut in half and eliminated some passages aimed at adults. The result was The Great Brain. ==Series titles== Titles in order of chronological continuity include: # The Great Brain (1967) # More Adventures of the Great Brain (1969) # Me and My Little Brain (1971) # The Great Brain At The Academy (1972) # The Great Brain Reforms (1973) # The Return of the Great Brain (1974) # The Great Brain Does It Again (1976) # The Great Brain Is Back (Published in 1995 from loose notes after the author's death) ==Main characters== ===Fitzgerald family=== The Fitzgerald family members include: * John Dennis Fitzgerald (J.D.) - the narrator of the series, and youngest of the three brothers. * Tom Dennis Fitzgerald Junior (T.D.) - the mischievous middle brother and swindler extraordinaire. His nickname is \\"The Great Brain\\", and his escapades form the basis for the series. Throughout the series, Tom demonstrates that he possesses great intelligence and a money- loving heart, but at times, he also demonstrates great humanity and generosity. * Sweyn Dennis Fitzgerald (S.D.) - the eldest brother; who is more skilled than J.D. at catching Tom in the act. He and Tom attend Catholic boarding school together. After graduating that, Sweyn departs for Pennsylvania to live with relatives, where he attends his father's alma mater high school. He and Tom are two years apart, but Tom is only one grade behind Sweyn, because in Adenville his teacher let him skip the fifth grade. * Frankie Pennyworth - An unconscious boy rescued by Uncle Mark after a storm blocks his brother and parents. When he first arrives, he has a mental block stemming from this trauma, in which he lashes out menacingly at the Fitzgeralds. John reflects that his name should be \\"Frankenstein Dollarworth\\", because, he says, Frankie is \\"a monster and a dollar's worth of trouble\\", and a battle of wills ensues when John is promised a large sum of money to try to cure Frankie's mental block, but only if Frankie does not need to be taken to a doctor in Salt Lake City. Frankie eventually becomes much better behaved and is adopted into the Fitzgerald family. * Thomas Dennis Fitzgerald Senior (\\"Papa\\" or \\"Fitz\\") - patriarch of the family. Owner, editor, and publisher of the town paper, the \\"Adenville Weekly Advocate\\". He is an Irish Catholic originally from the Soutern United States who headed west to seek his fortune as a newspaper writer and publisher. He is one of Adenville's leading citizens, and highly respected amongst the residents as he is the only citizen of Adenville to hold a university diploma. * Tena (\\"Mamma\\") Fitzgerald - The matriarch of the family and homemaker, of Danish-Scandinavian ancestry. * Aunt Bertha - A Catholic widow who works as the family's maid, not actually a blood relative but still called \\"aunt\\" because she has been considered a part of their family. John explains that after Bertha's husband died, his parents hired her as she had no children, social network, or living relatives, showing the dearth of Protestants in Adenville. * Uncle Mark - The town marshal, who is the uncle of John and the one who discovered the landslide that killed the Pennyworth family and rescued an unconscious Frankie. * Aunt Cathie - Mark's wife and Papa's sister, who considers adopting Frankie due to the fact she and Mark are childless on account of an earlier miscarriage. When Frankie says he wishes to live with the Fitzgeralds instead, she accepts it on the basis she will still be his aunt, and she and Mark go to an orphanage in Salt Lake City to adopt a daughter and son. All the Fitzgerald men have the middle name of Dennis, a reminder of the \\"Fitzgerald Curse\\", put upon the family because an ancestor named Dennis helped the British during the Revolutionary War. His father decreed that all male Fitzgeralds should have Dennis as their middle name to remind them of his son's loyalty to the Crown. In reality, the author had an older sister, Belle Empey (n√©e Fitzgerald).\\"John Dennis Fitzgerald,\\" Utah History to Go. Accessed Aug. 2, 2018. In addition, his brother \\"Sweyn\\" doesn't have that name; the real John's two elder brothers were named William and Tom, and he had two younger brothers, Gerald and Charles. There was no record of his parents ever adopting any children. ==Other characters== * Andy Anderson, a boy who loses his left leg due to a rusty nail. Later he falls into severe depression over this and even considers suicide, until Tom convinces Andy he can still do chores and play. * Parley Benson, son of a bounty hunter and the model of most of the other boys. He possesses his own coonskin cap, a Bowie knife, and his own repeating air rifle. Tom wins Parley's air rifle in a bet about whether Tom could magnetize wood. After reading about boomerangs in an encyclopedia and seeing an illustration of one in a dictionary, Tom fashions a boomerang from a stick, and after throwing it, holds up a magnet to make it appear the magnet is bringing it back. Losing his air rifle earns Parley the \\"worst whipping of his life\\" from his father. Another story has Tom betting who is braver by having both boys break curfew and meet at the entrance to the haunted Skeleton Cave. * Dotty Blake, also known as \\"Britches Dotty\\", a \\"tomboy\\" whom Tom teaches to read , and who is given dresses and taught to act like a conventional girl by Tom's mother. Dotty beats up Sammy Leeds when he teases her. * Danny Forester, son of the town's barber. Danny's left eye always seems half-shut, except when he gets excited. Tom swindles Danny out of a quality baseball glove by betting on hypnotism, which earns Danny a whipping from his father. * Abie Glassman, a Jewish itinerant salesman who winds up settling in Adenville and opening a variety store. His store doesn't bring in enough money, and he starves to death. * Jimmy Gruber, a diabetic boy who dies in childhood, after his father steals Frankie's rocking horse (named 'Bullet') as a present before Jimmy dies. When Frankie realizes the gravity of diabetes, he allows the Grubers to keep his expensive swing horse. * Eddie Huddle, Frankie's best friend and son of the town goldsmith. * Frank and Allan Jensen, who are children of Scandinavian immigrants. When to being unfamiliar with Adenville, they get lost with their dog Lady, whereas John recalls that \\"before any native boy and girl in Adenville was allowed to go outside unsupervised, they had to swear on the Bible to stay away from Skeleton Cave\\". Their disappearance mobilizes the entire town into action to search the mammoth cave. Tom rescues the boys using his 'great brain'. * Howard Kay, one of John's best friends, who has \\"a round face like a pumpkin\\". In the first book, John, wanting to get the mumps before Tom and Sweyn and expose them, sneaks into Howard's bedroom when he is quarantined with mumps and begs him to breathe on him, which Howard does (albeit reluctantly). Later, Howard was reluctant to ride on Tom's raft Explorer when the river had turned muddy, which was a sign of a looming flood. However, Tom pressured Howard by calling him \\"yellow bellied\\" if he backed out (and thus lose the five-cent admission). The subsequent flooding becomes a disastrous ride, nearly killing Howard. When John sees Uncle Mark and Parley Benson's father attempting to revive Howard by feeding him whiskey, this sends John into shock, and he faints. * Basil Kokovinis, a Greek boy who recently immigrated to America. His father, George Kokovinis, runs the Palace Cafe in Adenville and speaks good English having come to America five years before his wife and son. Upon his arrival in Adenville he has difficulty assimilating, until Tom takes the initiative to show Basil the ropes of being a bona fide American kid. He was originally referred to in the book as Vasillios, until his father anglicized his name to Basil, being the English equivalent. * Sammy Leeds, who is something of a bully. His father is bigoted and incites him to harass Basil, a newly arrived Greek immigrant, but is given his comeuppance when Tom encourages a lumberjack-style fight and Basil bests Sammy in wrestling, which the Greeks have excelled at. * Jimmy Peterson, another of John's best friends, whose mother owns the local boarding house. Along with Danny Forester, Jimmy is swindled out of a baseball when Tom bets him, causing his mother to \\"give him a horsewhipping\\". He is almost killed along with Howard Kay and Tom on Tom's river raft the \\"Explorer\\" when a flood strikes. This incites anger in John as Tom put his friends' lives in danger for a fast buck. * Polly Reagan, who becomes Tom's girlfriend when he turns 13. She has a \\"great brain\\" as well, having tied Tom in the town spelling bee. John resents her dating Tom, as she has taken all of Tom's attention to the detriment of playing with John and his friends. * Seth Smith, a local Mormon boy close to Tom's age. He is friends with both Tom and John as he is too young to be included with the bigger kids. Seth's father owned a vacant lot, which he allowed the kids to use in exchange for keeping it free of weeds and litter. As there are no baseball diamonds or playgrounds in Adenville, this is the usual site where the kids play baseball, scrub football, or other games such as run sheep run. John was given a pig by Seth in exchange for a sought-after toy, only for John's mother to screech she will not have any pig breeding on the Fitzgerald land. * Herbie Sties, a fat poet whom Tom sets out to reform out of his eating habits. * Harold Vickers, son of the district attorney. Harold is 16, making him older than the other kids. He knows a great deal about the law and plans to become a lawyer when he is older. He is chosen by John to act as the judge at a trial for Tom set in the Fitzgerald barn. During the trial, Tom is charged with being a confidence man, swindler, and a crook by all of the kids in Adenville who were victims of Tom and his Great Brain. As this trial occurred soon after the disastrous river rafting, Tom is also accused of being negligent toward Jimmy Peterson and Howard Kay. * Marie Vinson, daughter of the Vinsons, a prominent family in Adenville. Sweyn has a crush on Marie, much to John and Tom's chagrin. John refers to her as \\"that stuck-up Marie Vinson\\". Sweyn later returns home from high school wearing fancy Eastern clothing which he shows off to Marie, causing further mortification for John and Tom. ===Religious demographics=== Catholicism is central to the family's life and identity, a recurring theme in a town where Catholics are distinctly in the minority. The breakdown is said to be 2,000 Mormons, 500 or so Protestants, and only about 100 Catholics. All the non- Mormons or \\"Gentiles\\" attend a generalized community church, and the Fitzgeralds have to make do with the services of itinerant priests and of the local preacher, Reverend Holcomb, who preaches \\"strictly from the Bible\\" so he does not show favoritism to either Protestants or Catholics. It was said that once a year a Catholic priest would visit Adenville to hear confessions, baptize babies or do specifically Catholic rituals; other times a Protestant minister would do likewise, such as marry Protestants. The Jewish population is almost nonexistent, consisting solely of an aging itinerant Jewish peddler named Abie Glassman who sets up a shop in Adenville with tragic results, as chronicled in the first book in the series, The Great Brain. Abie dies of starvation because his small shop cannot compete with the ZCMI store. Papa explains to the townspeople that it was because Abie was a Jew that no one recognized or helped him with his situation. With Abie's death, it can be inferred that the town no longer has any Jewish people living in it. It is also not known if Basil Kokovinis and his family are Greek Orthodox. ===Education=== * Papa, who had migrated from the northeastern United States, is the only person in town with a college education. Although many adults in Adenville lack a formal education, they are respectful of those who do, and the narrator remarks that his father was considered the smartest man in town as he was the only resident of Adenville to hold a university diploma. * Papa also bemoans the fact that most boys in Adenville will be limited as careers and apprenticeships often have a prerequisite of an eighth grade education, which Adenville lacked in the beginning, and helped expand elementary education to solve this problem. * Adenville contains a one-room schoolhouse with a single teacher who teaches the first through sixth grades. * Parochial school: Papa sends Tom and Sweyn to a Catholic boarding academy in Salt Lake City that serves ten boys in the seventh grade and ten boys in the eighth grade. Much of this is discussed in The Great Brain at the Academy, where the Jesuit priests enforce strict discipline and have an academic curriculum more challenging than what Tom faced in Adenville. * Later, as part of Thomas' initiative to expand lower education, a junior high known as the Adenville Academy is commissioned. Tom attends eighth grade there. * In the series Sweyn attends high school in Boylestown, Pennsylvania, where Papa had earned his high school diploma. Sweyn lives with distant relatives of Papa's in Pennsylvania. One chapter touches upon the more stylish ways of the East, as shown by Sweyn's \\"dude\\" ways, as opposed to the West, which is slower to accept such ways due to being more concerned with settlement and hard work. ==Historical context== Fitzgerald's books describe many issues regarding society and life in the context of the late 19th century, between 1896 and 1898 in the southwestern United States. Among the topics covered are the following: * The dangers of backsliding, or ‚Äògoing back‚Äô on one‚Äôs word. This was considered the most heinous act one could commit and one could be blackmailed for even calling someone else a backslider. * The small-town culture of long ago * Diabetes as a fatal disease (before insulin) * The banking system in the days before the Federal Reserve, * Mormonism, Catholicism and Lutheranism. * Transportation in the days before the Interstate Highway System. The citizens of Adenville often get where they want to go by walking or making use of horse and buckboard. Bicycling is seldom as most citizens of Adenville are unable to afford this. For extra-long journeys, such as when Tom goes to boarding school in Salt Lake City or Sweyn goes to Pennsylvania for high school, the train is used. * Sewage and sanitation. Outhouses (referred to as \\"backhouses\\" in Utah at that time, due to the term \\"outhouse\\" being used in that region to refer to a storage shed, workshed, or other small out-building behind the main house) are not only the norm, they are a mark of social status, with the richest people having backhouses with ornate woodwork. When Papa orders a flush toilet (called a \\"water closet\\") from Sears Roebuck and has a cesspool built, the whole town at first thinks it is an unwise placement of a backhouse indoors, until they see it work and then become fascinated. * Child discipline. Most families gave their children \\"whippings\\". In The Great Brain Reforms, Parley Benson says that his pa gave him \\"the worst whipping\\" for letting Tom cheat him out of his repeating air rifle, as do Danny Forester says his father gave him the same treatment for losing his baseball glove to Tom in a bet, and Jimmy Peterson says his mother \\"gave him a horsewhipping\\" for losing his baseball to \\"that Fitzgerald kid\\". The better-educated, more progressive Fitzgeralds are a notable exception with their use of the silent treatment. This means that Mr. and Mrs. Fitzgerald will not talk to or acknowledge those who are punished. It often lasted from a range of one day to one week depending on the infraction, but could be longer. J.D. frequently describes the silent treatment as worse than a whipping because of the emotional impact of being ignored by his parents, and at times says that he wishes his parents would just give them a whipping and get it over with. One chapter dealt with Frankie being subject to the silent treatment and misconstruing it as being disinherited from the Fitzgeralds, causing him to run away from home. In later books as Tom and J.D. age, Papa admits the silent treatment is becoming outmoded, and now resorts to extra chores or revocation of allowances as punishments. * In loco parentis. School is often shown as having little tolerance for child hijinks. ** In The Great Brain, a teacher is shown who paddles boys who break school rules. Girls who break school rules are slapped on the palm with a ruler and made to stay after school to clean it. When Tom gets paddled for refusing to tattle on a friend, this sets events in motion where he swears to have the teacher terminated. ** In The Great Brain at the Academy, the Jesuit priests assign boys who break school rules with jobs such as cleaning the latrine or peeling potatoes in the early morning hours. In addition, demerits are assigned, with the threat of expulsion to any boy who exceeds his demerit allowance in a given timeframe. * Non-conformity and machismo. Tom's, John's, or other boys' fears that they will be seen as cowards, sissies, or welchers by the other boys of the town is a driving factor in more than a few of the stories. * The boys often settle conflicts by fighting with detailed descriptions of punches thrown such as ‚ÄúHaymakers‚Äù. John tells that he and his brothers stopped all teasing of them from the Mormons by being able to get proficient to \\"whip\\" any Mormon bullies in a fight. Tom tries teaching Basil Kokovinis fistfighting but when Basil tries wrestling moves, Tom realizes that is how Greeks fight and gets Basil to challenge bully Sammy Leeds in a \\"lumberjack style\\" fight. * Leisure time amusements and activities in the days before radio and television. * There is an anachronism in the series about Cracker Jack. In The Return of the Great Brain, Tom concocts a swindle using a \\"wheel of fortune\\", like a roulette wheel, where players win prizes depending on the number on which the wheel stops spinning. Half of the numbers win two boxes of Cracker Jack, with, as Tom says, \\"the usual prize in each box.\\" However, prizes did not appear in Cracker Jack until 1912; the Great Brain series is set in the late 19th century. * Another anachronism is that an Erector Set appears in the first two novels. However, Erector Sets were first sold in 1913. * There is also an anachronism about telecommunications. Citizens of Adenville are often shown phoning each other. Yet in the 1890s, when the stories are set, the telephone was used mostly by businesses. Fewer than 3% of residential buildings in the United States had a telephone installed. It would have been highly unlikely for the poorer families in Adenville to afford a telephone, as it would not be until the prosperity of the 1950s that the vast majority of American homes could afford to subscribe to a phone service. * There are some chapters in the series involving the paranormal, although the events can be explained naturally. ** In The Great Brain, Tom involves his friends in a plan to frame the new schoolteacher for being a drunk, and makes them swear an oath not to tell on the skull of a purported dead Indian chief, calling upon the chief's ghost to \\"come back to earth and cut out the tongue of anybody who tells\\". ** In More Adventures of the Great Brain, the people of Adenville, including Papa and Uncle Mark, believe that a prehistoric animal is on the loose due to \\"monster tracks\\" leading from Skeleton Cave to the river and back. In reality, Tom has created those tracks to scare Parley Benson away from the cave and win a bet. ** Later in the same book, Tom, John, Sweyn, and several of their friends encounter a ghost in the abandoned mining town of Silverlode; the \\"ghost\\" is really the uncle of one of their friends dressed in a sheet, for the purpose of scaring them away from the very real physical dangers of that place. ** In Me and My Little Brain, John scares Frankie with a story about a ghost who comes to eat children, but is repelled by those who sleep in their own beds, in an attempt to get Frankie to stop sleeping in his bed. ** In The Great Brain at the Academy, Tom and his friend Jerry win a bet by making it appear that Jerry can read minds, inspired by the boys being taken to a carnival by the priests and seeing a professional sideshow act of a magician. Tom later reveals how the real magician and his assistant pulled off the trick. ** In The Great Brain Does It Again, Tom has Herbie Sties, the \\"greedy gut\\", take a \\"sacred oath\\" on the Bible to \\"stop eating ice cream and candy and more than one dessert a day\\", declaring that \\"if I break my sacred vow, my soul will belong to the Devil and I'll burn in everlasting Hell\\". When Herbie still does not lose even one pound, Tom and John investigate and secretly observe him consuming a bag-load of candy. Rather than denounce him on the spot, Tom has John dress up in a devil costume and knock on Herbie's window as he is getting ready for bed. Herbie believes for five days that a devil really has come to claim his soul, although the trick is eventually revealed. * Crime. The author details various crimes that took place in Utah, but in one book explains that 20th Century Hollywood distorted the image of American West as a place of anarchy and lawlessness, which was not quite true due to the law enforcement of those days. In many cases of crime presented, Tom or John helped get to the bottom of it, often with their help of the town marshal, their Uncle Mark. ** In More Adventures of the Great Brain, a bank robbery occurs where Mr. Whitlock is roused from his bed in the middle of the night, held at gunpoint and forced to go to his workplace and unsecure the safe. ** In The Great Brain at the Academy, Tom accuses a man of cheating at cards, and backs up his proof by showing that the backs of the cards were marked with slightly differing decorations. Tom realized this as exactly the same fraud had occurred in Adenville years earlier, with Uncle Mark arresting the cheaters. ** In Me and My Little Brain, John explains how Papa had been marked for death by Cal Roberts (along with the judge and D.A.) as he was the jury foreman at his trial. When Cal Roberts escapes from jail, he seeks his revenge...by holding Frankie at gunpoint, rendering all of Adenville paralyzed with fear. ** In The Great Brain Reforms, three men representing \\"Alkali Products Incorporated\\" look to set up shop in Adenville, wowing the citizenry with the enticement of an economic boom. Tom suspects they are confidence men. ** In The Return of the Great Brain, a cattle king is robbed on a train, then murdered shortly after he identifies the robber. ** In The Great Brain is Back, Tom also helps prove the innocence of three Native Americans framed for theft, breaks up a dogfighting ring, and escapes kidnappers. == See also == * ==References== ==External links== * Finding Fitzgerald Research Site--All things Great Brain related. * Current Day Discussion Blog * The Great Brain, 1978 movie details Category:Fiction set in the 1890s Category:Juvenile series Category:Latter Day Saints in popular culture Category:Novels set in Utah Category:Series of children's books ","title":"The Great Brain"},{"id":"1434245","text":"CWS may refer to: == Environment == * Canadian Wildlife Service, also known as Environment Canada * Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary, Queensland, Australia * County Wildlife Site, local reserve status == Baseball == * Chicago White Sox, Major League Baseball team * College World Series, college baseball tournament conducted by the NCAA * Caribbean World Series, yearly tournament between top winter teams from Puerto Rico, Mexico, Dominican Republic and Venezuela == Cooperatives == * Church World Service, cooperative humanitarian ministry * The Co-operative Group, formerly Co-operative Wholesale Society, a consumer co-operative in the United Kingdom * A co-operative wholesale society, is a form of co-operative federation (that is, a co-operative in which all the members are co-operatives), in this case, the members are usually consumers' co-operatives == Technology == * Citrix Workspace Services, enterprises and partners can rapidly build and offer desktops-as-a-service (DaaS), virtual application delivery and mobility services from any cloud * Control Wheel Steering, an autopilot mode where the pilot controls the autopilot through the yoke *Centralne Warsztaty Samochodowe, Polish pre-war automobile manufacturer ** CWS T-1, the first serially built car manufactured in Poland == Military == * Chemical Warfare Service, a U.S. Army service branch, later known as Chemical Corps * Commander's Weapon Station, the aiming and firing system for the Commander's machine gun on the M1 Abrams tank == Other == * Calfrac Well Services, oilfield servicing company * Celebrity worship syndrome, an obsessive-addictive disorder in which a person becomes overly involved with the details of a celebrity's personal life * Christian Worship: Supplement, a hymnal used by the WELS * Chrome Web Store, Google's online store for web applications for Google Chrome or Google Apps * Chronic wasting disease, a transmissible disease affecting deer and other cervid animals * Compressed work schedule * CoolWebSearch, spyware ==See also== * CWSDPMI, a DOS extender by Charles W.

The best historical examples of this are the English CWS and the Scottish CWS, which are the predecessors of the 21st century Co-operative Group. Indeed, in Britain, the terms Co-operative Wholesale Society and CWS are used to refer to this specific organisation rather than the organisational form. However, the English CWS has inspired many imitations around the world (including, for example, the New South Wales Co-operative Wholesale Society who have also described themselves as co-operative wholesale societies. ==Bibliographical history== * The Story of the C.W.S.

Planetary migration is the most likely explanation for hot Jupiters: exoplanets with Jovian masses but orbits of only a few days. The generally accepted theory of planet formation from a protoplanetary disk predicts such planets cannot form so close to their stars, as there is insufficient mass at such small radii and the temperature is too high to allow the formation of rocky or icy planetesimals. It has also become clear that terrestrial-mass planets may be subject to rapid inward migration if they form while the gas disk is still present. This may affect the formation of the cores of the giant planets (which have masses of the order of 10 Earth masses), if those planets form via the core-accretion mechanism. == Types of disk == === Gas disk === Protoplanetary gas disks around young stars are observed to have lifetimes of a few million years. If planets with masses of around an Earth mass or greater form while the gas is still present, the planets can exchange angular momentum with the surrounding gas in the protoplanetary disk so that their orbits change gradually. Although the sense of migration is typically inwards in locally isothermal disks, outward migration may occur in disks that possess entropy gradients. === Planetesimal disk === During the late phase of planetary system formation, massive protoplanets and planetesimals gravitationally interact in a chaotic manner causing many planetesimals to be thrown into new orbits. This results in angular-momentum exchange between the planets and the planetesimals, and leads to migration (either inward or outward). Outward migration of Neptune is believed to be responsible for the resonant capture of Pluto and other Plutinos into the 3:2 resonance with Neptune. == Types of migration == There are many different mechanisms by which planets' orbits can migrate, which are described below as disk migration (Type I migration, Type II migration, or Type III migration), tidal migration, planetesimal-driven migration, gravitational scattering, and Kozai cycles and tidal friction. This list of types is not exhaustive or definitive: Depending on what is most convenient for any one type of study, different researchers will distinguish mechanisms in somewhat different ways. Classification of any one mechanism is mainly based on the circumstances in the disk that enable the mechanism to efficiently transfer energy and / or angular momentum to and from planetary orbits. As the loss or relocation of material in the disk changes the circumstances, one migration mechanism will give way to another mechanism, or perhaps none. If there is no follow-on mechanism, migration (largely) stops and the stellar system becomes (mostly) stable. === Disk migration === Disk migration arises from the gravitational force exerted by a sufficiently massive body embedded in a disk on the surrounding disk's gas, which perturbs its density distribution. By the reaction principle of classical mechanics, the gas exerts an equal and opposite gravitational force on the body, which can also be expressed in terms of a torque. This torque alters the angular momentum of the planet's orbit, resulting in a variation of the semi-major axis and other orbital elements. An increase over time of the semi-major axis leads to outward migration, i.e., away from the star, whereas the opposite behavior leads to inward migration. Three sub-types of disk migration are distinguished as Types I, II, and III, however the numbering is not intended to suggest a sequence or stages. ==== Type I disk migration ==== Small planets undergo Type I disk migration driven by torques arising from Lindblad and co- rotation resonances. Lindblad resonances excite spiral density waves in the surrounding gas, both interior and exterior of the planet's orbit. In most cases, the outer spiral wave exerts a greater torque than does the inner wave, causing the planet to lose angular momentum, and hence migrate toward the star. The migration rate due to these torques is proportional to the mass of the planet and to the local gas density, and results in a migration timescale that tends to be short relative to the million-year lifetime of the gaseous disk. Additional co-rotation torques are also exerted by gas orbiting with a period similar to that of the planet. In a reference frame attached to the planet, this gas follows horseshoe orbits, reversing direction when it approaches the planet from ahead or from behind. The gas reversing course ahead of the planet originates from a larger semi-major axis and may be cooler and denser than the gas reversing course behind the planet. This may result in a region of excess density ahead of the planet and of lesser density behind the planet, causing the planet to gain angular momentum. The planet mass for which migration can be approximated to Type I depends on the local gas pressure scale height and, to a lesser extent, the kinematic viscosity of the gas. In warm and viscous disks, Type I migration may apply to larger mass planets. In locally isothermal disks and far from steep density and temperature gradients, co-rotation torques are generally overpowered by the Lindblad torques. Regions of outward migration may exist for some planetary mass ranges and disk conditions in both local isothermal and non-isothermal disks. The locations of these regions may vary during the evolution of the disk, and in the local-isothermal case are restricted to regions with large density and/or temperature radial gradients over several pressure scale- heights. Type I migration in a local isothermal disk was shown to be compatible with the formation and long-term evolution of some of the observed Kepler planets. The rapid accretion of solid material by the planet may also produce a \\"heating torque\\" that causes the planet to gain angular momentum. ==== Type II disk migration ==== A planet massive enough to open a gap in a gaseous disk undergoes a regime referred to as Type II disk migration. When the mass of a perturbing planet is large enough, the tidal torque it exerts on the gas transfers angular momentum to the gas exterior of the planet's orbit, and does the opposite interior to the planet, thereby repelling gas from around the orbit. In a Type I regime, viscous torques can efficiently counter this effect by resupplying gas and smoothing out sharp density gradients. But when the torques become strong enough to overcome the viscous torques in the vicinity of the planet's orbit, a lower density annular gap is created. The depth of this gap depends on the temperature and viscosity of the gas and on the planet mass. In the simple scenario in which no gas crosses the gap, the migration of the planet follows the viscous evolution of the disk's gas. In the inner disk, the planet spirals inward on the viscous timescale, following the accretion of gas onto the star. In this case, the migration rate is typically slower than would be the migration of the planet in the Type I regime. In the outer disk, however, migration can be outward if the disk is viscously expanding. A Jupiter-mass planet in a typical protoplanetary disk is expected to undergo migration at approximately the Type II rate, with the transition from Type I to Type II occurring at roughly the mass of Saturn, as a partial gap is opened. Type II migration is one explanation for the formation of hot Jupiters. In more realistic situations, unless extreme thermal and viscosity conditions occur in a disk, there is an ongoing flux of gas through the gap. As a consequence of this mass flux, torques acting on a planet can be susceptible to local disk properties, akin to torques at work during Type I migration. Therefore, in viscous disks, Type II migration can be typically described as a modified form of Type I migration, in a unified formalism. The transition between Type I and Type II migration is generally smooth, but deviations from a smooth transition have also been found. In some situations, when planets induce eccentric perturbation in the surrounding disk's gas, Type II migration may slow down, stall, or reverse. From a physical viewpoint, Type I and Type II migration are driven by the same type of torques (at Lindblad and co-rotation resonances). In fact, they can be interpreted and modeled as a single regime of migration, that of Type I appropriately modified by the perturbed gas surface density of the disk. ==== Type III disk migration ==== Type III disk migration applies to fairly extreme disk / planet cases and is characterized by extremely short migration timescales. Although sometimes referred to as \\"runaway migration\\", the migration rate does not necessarily increase over time. Type III migration is driven by the co-orbital torques from gas trapped in the planet's libration regions and from an initial, relatively fast, planetary radial motion. The planet's radial motion displaces gas in its co-orbital region, creating a density asymmetry between the gas on the leading and the trailing side of the planet. Type III migration applies to disks that are relatively massive and to planets that can only open partial gaps in the gas disk. Previous interpretations linked Type III migration to gas streaming across the orbit of the planet in the opposite direction as the planet's radial motion, creating a positive feedback loop. Fast outward migration may also occur temporarily, delivering giant planets to distant orbits, if later Type II migration is ineffective at driving the planets back. === Gravitational scattering === Another possible mechanism that may move planets over large orbital radii is gravitational scattering by larger planets or, in a protoplantetary disk, gravitational scattering by over-densities in the fluid of the disk. In the case of the Solar System, Uranus and Neptune may have been gravitationally scattered onto larger orbits by close encounters with Jupiter and/or Saturn. Systems of exoplanets can undergo similar dynamical instabilities following the dissipation of the gas disk that alter their orbits and in some cases result in planets being ejected or colliding with the star. Planets scattered gravitationally can end on highly eccentric orbits with perihelia close to the star, enabling their orbits to be altered due to the tides they raise on the star. The eccentricities and inclinations of these planets are also excited during these encounters, providing one possible explanation for the observed eccentricity distribution of the closely orbiting exoplanets. The resulting systems are often near the limits of stability. As in the Nice model, systems of exoplanets with an outer disk of planetesimals can also undergo dynamical instabilities following resonance crossings during planetesimal-driven migration. The eccentricites and inclinations of the planets on distant orbits can be damped by dynamical friction with the planetesimals with the final values depending on the relative masses of the disk and the planets that had gravitational encounters. === Tidal migration === Tides between the star and planet modify the semi-major axis and orbital eccentricity of the planet. If the planet is orbiting very near to its star, the tide of the planet raises a bulge on the star. If the star's rotational period is longer than the planet's orbital period the location of the bulge lags behind a line between the planet and the center of the star creating a torque between the planet and the star. As a result, the planet loses angular momentum and its semi-major axis decreases with time. If the planet is in an eccentric orbit the strength of the tide is stronger when it is near perihelion. The planet is slowed the most when near perihelion, causing its aphelion to decrease faster than its perihelion, reducing its eccentricity. Unlike disk migration ‚Äì which lasts a few million years until the gas dissipates ‚Äì tidal migration continues for billions of years. Tidal evolution of close-in planets produces semi-major axes typically half as large as they were at the time that the gas nebula cleared. ===Kozai cycles and tidal friction=== A planetary orbit that is inclined relative to the plane of a binary star can shrink due to a combination of Kozai cycles and tidal friction. Interactions with the more distant star cause the planets orbit to undergo an exchange of eccentricity and inclination due to the Kozai mechanism. This process can increase the planet's eccentricity and lower its perihelion enough to create strong tides between the planet on the star increases. When it is near the star the planet loses angular momentum causing its orbit to shrink. The planet's eccentricity and inclination cycle repeatedly, slowing the evolution of the planets semi- major axis. If the planet's orbit shrinks enough to remove it from the influence of the distant star the Kozai cycles end. Its orbit will then shrink more rapidly as it is tidally circularized. The orbit of the planet can also become retrograde due to this process. Kozai cycles can also occur in a system with two planets that have differing inclinations due to gravitational scattering between planets and can result in planets with retrograde orbits. ===Planetesimal-driven migration=== The orbit of a planet can change due to gravitational encounters with a large number of planetesimals. Planetesimal- driven migration is the result of the accumulation of the transfers of angular momentum during encounters between the planetesimals and a planet. For individual encounters the amount of angular momentum exchanged and the direction of the change in the planet's orbit depends on the geometry of the encounter. For a large number of encounters the direction of the planet's migration depends on the average angular momentum of the planetesimals relative to the planet. If it is higher, for example a disk outside the planet's orbit, the planet migrates outward, if it is lower the planet migrates inward. The migration of a planet beginning with a similar angular momentum as the disk depends on potential sinks and sources of the planetesimals. For a single planet system, planetesimals can only be lost (a sink) due to their ejection, which would cause the planet to migrate inward. In multiple planet systems the other planets can act as sinks or sources. Planetesimals can be removed from the planet's influence after encountering an adjacent planet or transferred to that planet's influence. These interactions cause the planet's orbits to diverge as the outer planet tends to remove planetesimals with larger momentum from the inner planet influence or add planetesimals with lower angular momentum, and vice versa. The planet's resonances, where the eccentricities of planetesimals are pumped up until they intersect with the planet, also act as a source. Finally, the planet's migration acts as both a sink and a source of new planetesimals creating a positive feedback that tends to continue its migration in the original direction. Planetesimal-driven migration can be damped if planetesimals are lost to various sinks faster than new ones are encountered due to its sources. It may be sustained if the new planetesimals enter its influence faster than they are lost. If sustained migration is due to its migration only, it is called runaway migration. If it is due to the loss of planetesimals to another planets influence, it is called forced migration For a single planet orbiting in a planetesial disk the shorter timescales of the encounters with planetesimals with shorter period orbits results in more frequent encounters with the planetesimals with less angular momentum and the inward migration of the planet. Planetesimal-driven migration in a gas disk, however, can be outward for a particular range of planetesimal sizes because of the removal of shorter period planetesimals due to gas drag. ==Resonance capture== The migration of planets can lead to planets being captured in resonances and chains of resonances if their orbits converge. The orbits of the planets can converge if the migration of the inner planet is halted at the inner edge of the gas disk, resulting in a systems of tightly orbiting inner planets; or if migration is halted in a convergence zone where the torques driving Type I migration cancel, for example near the ice line, in a chain of more distant planets. Gravitational encounters can also lead to the capture of planets with sizable eccentricities in resonances. In the Grand tack hypothesis the migration of Jupiter is halted and reversed when it captured Saturn in an outer resonance. The halting of Jupiter's and Saturn's migration and the capture of Uranus and Neptune in further resonances may have prevented the formation of a compact system of super-earths similar to many of those found by Kepler. The outward migration of planets can also result in the capture of planetesimals in resonance with the outer planet; for example the resonant trans-Neptunian objects in the Kuiper belt. Although planetary migration is expected to lead to systems with chains of resonant planets most exoplanets are not in resonances. The resonance chains can be disrupted by gravitational instabilities once the gas disk dissipates. Interactions with leftover planetesimals can break resonances of low mass planets leaving them in orbits slightly outside the resonance. Tidal interactions with the star, turbulence in the disk, and interactions with the wake of another planet could also disrupt resonances. Resonance capture might be avoided for planets smaller than Neptune with eccentric orbits. == In the Solar System == Simulation showing outer planets and Kuiper belt: (a) Before Jupiter/Saturn 2:1 resonance. (b) Scattering of Kuiper belt objects into the Solar System after the orbital shift of Neptune. (c) After ejection of Kuiper belt bodies by Jupiter The migration of the outer planets is a scenario proposed to explain some of the orbital properties of the bodies in the Solar System's outermost regions. Beyond Neptune, the Solar System continues into the Kuiper belt, the scattered disc, and the Oort cloud, three sparse populations of small icy bodies thought to be the points of origin for most observed comets. At their distance from the Sun, accretion was too slow to allow planets to form before the solar nebula dispersed, because the initial disc lacked enough mass density to consolidate into a planet. The Kuiper belt lies between 30 and 55 AU from the Sun, while the farther scattered disc extends to over 100 AU, and the distant Oort cloud begins at about 50,000 AU. According to this scenario the Kuiper belt was originally much denser and closer to the Sun: it contained millions of planetesimals, and had an outer edge at approximately 30 AU, the present distance of Neptune. After the formation of the Solar System, the orbits of all the giant planets continued to change slowly, influenced by their interaction with the large number of remaining planetesimals. After 500‚Äì600 million years (about 4 billion years ago) Jupiter and Saturn divergently crossed the 2:1 orbital resonance, in which Saturn orbited the Sun once for every two Jupiter orbits. This resonance crossing increased the eccentricities of Jupiter and Saturn and destabilized the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. Encounters between the planets followed causing Neptune to surge past Uranus and plough into the dense planetesimal belt. The planets scattered the majority of the small icy bodies inwards, while moving outwards themselves. These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets' orbits outwards while they moved inwards. This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward. This scattering scenario explains the trans-Neptunian populations' present low mass.

He was a member of the Generation of 1928 and a charter member of the Acci√≥n Democr√°tica party, and the first Labor minister of Venezuela (during El Trienio Adeco, 1945‚Äì48). ==Background== Leoni was born in El Manteco, Bol√≠var State, son of Clement Leoni Scribani, born in Corsica. He graduated at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas as a lawyer. He was a member of the Generation of 1928, and the first Labor minister of Venezuela (during El Trienio Adeco, 1945‚Äì48). == Presidency == Monument to Leoni and his wife Menca, Ciudad Bol√≠var, Venezuela Leoni took control of the presidency on 13 March 1964, succeeding R√≥mulo Betancourt; both were members of the Acci√≥n Democr√°tica. One of the pillars of a political consolidation in Venezuela, the Pacto de Punto Fijo, was underestimated by Leoni, since in his opinion it reduced the \\"coherence and organization of the regime\\". Strictly, the pact mandated that the composition of the executive cabinet be limited to representatives of three of the more important political parties: Acci√≥n Democr√°tica (AD), COPEI and Uni√≥n Republicana Democr√°tica (URD). Leoni initially formed a cabinet with a few members of his party and a good number of independents. Later, in November 1964, Leoni initiated conversations with leaders of the involved parties to rescue the spirit of the pact. A new cabinet was formed, but it lasted for only 16 months. During his government, Leoni carried out important structural projects in Venezuela, specifically the development of heavy industry in Guayana (hydroelectric, iron and steel), inauguration of the Bank of the Workers, and construction of road infrastructure (highways, freeways, and bridges ‚Äì the most important of which crossed the Orinoco). Important changes to labor and social programs also occurred; unions gained force and the Social Security law was modified. Leoni made an attempt at reforming tax structure, but was restrained by a coalition of left and right that openly served the interests of oil companies. During Leoni's presidency the conflict with the leftist guerrilla movement Armed Forces for National Liberation (FALN) intensified. Leoni's government was unexceptional, but it was Leoni who had to liquidate the remnants of the communist insurrection for which he put the army in charge of the country with full powers to be as ruthless as needed. However, it was the communist guerrilleros themselves who brought about their own liquidation. They had no rural support whatsoever. Unlike guerrillas all over the world, they did not control villages and lived from hand to mouth.Zago, Angela, Aqui no ha pasado nada, 1972 They knew that they were no match for the army and avoided confrontations. Castro had been hoping that Venezuela would be the second act of the Latin American revolution, and he tried to supply the Venezuelan guerrillas. That was in keeping with the theory of what could be called the \\"permanent agrarian revolution\\", which the French intellectual R√©gis Debray had expressed in the widely circulated book Revolution Inside the Revolution and Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara had been trying to carry out first in Africa and later, fatally for him, in Bolivia. In 1966, Castro selected a trusted officer, Arnaldo Ochoa, to assess the Venezuelan guerrillas. Ochoa with the Venezuelan guerrilla commander Luben Petkoff, took a boat to the shores of Falcon, Venezuela, one of his most secretive expedition. Along with 15 other members of the Cuban military went to Coro Sierra mountains to strengthen Douglas Bravo guerrillas who were fighting the government troops that ended in a major strategic loss at large human cost. In 1967, the Invasion of Machurucuto occurred with 12 Cubans and Venezuelans revolutionaries attempted to help Venezuelan guerrillas in the Venezuelan Andes. Soon afterward, Leoni suspended constitutional guarantees and, in a press conference, denouncing Cuban aggression against Venezuela and showed two captured Cubans: Manuel Gil Castellanos, and Pedro Cabrera Torres. Cuba was denounced by Venezuela to the Organization of American States. Cuba did not recognize his action even if the investigation of the AK 47 in possession of the guerrillas had serial numbers matching weapons sold by the Czech Republic to Cuba. The government of Venezuela broke off relations with Cuba them until 1974. That effectively ended Cuba's intervention in Venezuelan affairs.Szulc, Tad, Castro: a Critical Portrait, 1986 By then, Venezuelan leftists had given up on violence and were seeking legalisation, but Leoni did not offer it. Ochoa was later tried and executed by Castro on an unlikely charge of drug-smuggling. Meanwhile, Leoni signed the Cartagena Agreement. The precursor to the Andean Community, it was a trade bloc) in Bogot√° between Venezuela, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador. On 11 March 1969, Leoni transferred power to Rafael Caldera, a member of the Christian Democratic Party COPEI and a signatory of the Pacto de Punto Fijo. That transfer definitively instituted the alternation of power between the important parties until the late 20th century in Venezuela. ==Personal life and death== Ra√∫l Leoni was married to Carmen Am√©rica Fern√°ndez, who served as First Lady of Venezuela from 1964‚Äì1969 and has one son named √Ålvaro. Leoni died on 5 July 1972 when he was 67 years old, at the Cornell Medical Center in New York City, where he was recovering from medical treatment after suffering a hemorrhage. == See also == *Presidents of Venezuela ==References== *Much of the content of this article comes from the equivalent Spanish-language Wikipedia article.

He has written numerous popular Christian songs with his wife Gloria; he is also known for performing as part of the Bill Gaither Trio and the Gaither Vocal Band (GVB). In the 1990s, his career gained a resurgence (as well as the careers of other southern gospel artists), as popularity grew for the Gaither Homecoming series. ==Early life== Bill Gaither was born in Alexandria, Indiana in 1936 to George and Lela Gaither. He formed his first group the Bill Gaither Trio (consisting of Bill, his sister Mary Ann (1945‚Äì2018), and brother Danny Gaither) in 1956 while a college student at Anderson College, to which he had transferred after one year at Taylor University. He graduated from Anderson in 1959 with a major in English and a minor in music, after which he worked as an English teacher. He married the former Gloria Sickal in 1962. He tried for a few years to manage both a music career and his full-time teaching job, but he quit his teaching job in 1967 and worked full-time in the Christian music industry. He recorded his breakthrough song \\"He Touched Me\\" in 1964. Gaither was influenced by Southern gospel singers such as Jake Hess and Hovie Lister and by groups such as the Speers, the Statesmen, and the Happy Goodmans. ==Songwriter== Gaither and his wife, Gloria, have written many songs including: \\"The Longer I Serve Him,\\" \\"Because He Lives,\\" \\"The King Is Coming,\\" \\"Sinner Saved By Grace\\", \\"Something Beautiful,\\" \\"He Touched Me\\", \\"It Is Finished,\\" \\"Jesus, There's Something About That Name\\" \\"I'm Gonna Sing\\", and \\"Let's Just Praise The Lord.\\" His songs have been performed by Christian artists (David Crowder Band, Carman, The Imperials, Sandi Patty, The Cathedral Quartet, The Speers and the Heritage Singers), country singers (The Statler Brothers) and pop artists (Elvis Presley). The Gaithers have even delved into writing Christian music for children over the years, with their most notable song being \\"I Am a Promise\\". They have performed that song on the Billy Graham crusade and around the world. Gloria Gaither often writes the lyrics while Bill writes the music, although composing is usually a collaborative project between the two. As of 2005, they had composed 600 songs and by 2012 that number had increased to over 700. ==Performer== Bill Gaither performing, 2011 Since Gaither first began singing with the Bill Gaither Trio in the 1950s, he has constantly been performing. The trio originally consisted of Bill, his brother Danny Gaither and his sister Mary Ann Gaither. In about 1964 Bill's wife, Gloria, took the place of Mary Ann. The trio sang traditional gospel songs along with original compositions by the Gaithers that gave them a more contemporary feel. Gaither has a high bass voice (or low baritone), and often sang while playing piano with the Bill Gaither Trio. ==Entrepreneurship and influence== Gaither founded the Gaither Music Company, which includes the functions of record company, concert booking (Gaither Management Group), television production, copyright management (Gaither Copyright Management), retail store, recording studio (Gaither Studios, formerly Pinebrook Studios) and telemarketing for the Gaither organization reside. He also runs a retail center called Gaither Family Resources. Included as part of the company is Live Bait Productions, an animation company run by Benjy Gaither, one of Bill's three children. === Record labels === In the 1980s, Gaither was involved with Paragon Associates, which formed a partnership with Zondervan to buy Benson Records, which is now part of Sony BMG Music Entertainment. In 1994, Gaither and entrepreneur Leland Boren founded the Brentwood, Tennessee- based Chapel Hill Music Group, which later changed its name to Spring Hill Music Group. It was created as part of the Gaither Music Company to handle in- house productions, including the Gaither Homecoming series. === Industry Influence === David Phelps, Gordon Mote, Bill Gaither (left to right) in April 2009 Gaither has been a father figure and career booster to many younger performers in the Contemporary Christian music industry, while helping to prolong the careers of those who came before him for example by producing Homecoming recordings and tours. The following are all CCM artists who either got their start or became popular while touring with the Gaithers: Mark Lowry, Michael W. Smith, Carman, Sandi Patty, Steve Green, Don Francisco, Amy Grant, Michael English, Jonathan Pierce, Karla Worley, and Cynthia Clawson. He has maintained the Gaither Vocal Band with a variety of singers through the years, including Gary McSpadden, Steve Green, Lee Young, Jon Mohr, Larnelle Harris, Michael English, Lemuel Miller, Jim Murray, Mark Lowry, Terry Franklin, Buddy Mullins, Jonathan Pierce, Guy Penrod, David Phelps, Russ Taff, Marshall Hall, Wes Hampton, Adam Crabb, Todd Suttles and Reggie Smith. Guy Penrod and Mark Lowry were the members of the Gaither Vocal Band with the longest tenure besides Bill Gaither himself. Guy Penrod was with the group from 1995 to 2008 and Mark Lowry from 1988 to 2001. It was announced in January 2009 that Mark Lowry, Michael English and David Phelps were rejoining the group; at the same time the announcement was made that Guy Penrod and Marshall Hall were leaving to pursue a solo career. Gaither's Homecoming tours, which started in 1991, brought together major stars of the southern gospel and CCM industry, sparking a revival of the genres. The tours have sold more than 1.1 million tickets across the world, and have included such notable venues as the Kennedy Center and Carnegie Hall. Pollstar listed the tour as selling more tickets in 2004 than Elton John, Fleetwood Mac or Rod Stewart. Lynda Randle, The Isaacs, Russ Taff, the Hoppers, Jessy Dixon and many more have performed on the tours. ==Personal life== Bill and Gloria live in Alexandria, Indiana, and have three grown children. ==Discography== ===Gaither Trio=== ===Solo=== *2005: Bill Gaither ===Gaither Vocal Band=== ===Homecoming Series=== ==Bibliography== (This list excludes books of music and books that are companions to his \\"Homecoming\\" series.) *2003: Gaither, Bill and Ken Abraham.

The word Kloof (cf. cleft) means 'gorge' in Afrikaans and the area is named after the deep ravine formed by the Molweni stream (stream of high cliffs). The Kloof Gorge is part of the Krantzkloof Nature Reserve. Kloof extends from the top of Field's Hill and borders Winston Park, Gillitts, Forest Hills and Hillcrest. These suburbs are collectively known as the Upper Highway Area or the Outer West region of Durban. The M13 highway (built in the 1940s) intersects Kloof and on 16 June this forms part of the route of the annual Comrades Marathon, an approximately ultra-marathon run between Pietermaritzburg and Durban since 1924. It is a predominantly English-speaking area. Kloof features several upmarket shopping centres and the Kloof Country Club, founded in 1927. It is known as a mist-belt with winding roads and tree- surrounded mansions. ==History== Details of the history of Kloof has been written by ===Richmond Farm=== This part of KwaZulu-Natal was originally a farm 'Richmond', whose survey was ordained by the first Lieutenant-Governor of Colony Sir Martin West, following his 1845 appointment to the post; he also named it, after Charles Lennox, 4th Duke of Richmond (Yorkshire, England). The land Kloof occupies formed the Richmond Farm No. 999: this was purchased by William Swan FIELD, the first Collector of Customs (position he held until 1852) for Natal Colony, in 1845 for an amount of ¬£245. He was also one of the first Magistrates of Durban. In 1845 his brother John Coote FIELD and his family settled on the farm, having arrived from the Cape Colony on the Pilot. The farm was eventually transferred into J C Field's name by Deed of Transfer in 1867, at a declared value of ¬£1,401 pounds & 10 shillings. The original farmhouse, called Richmond House, was built by J C Field in 1854 to replace an earlier wattle & daub house. The 'Richmond' section of the farm passed to his son John Coote FIELD the Second in 1880 on the occasion of his marriage, who partially demolished the original Richmond House and rebuilt another homestead nearby. J C Field the First died in 1896, and upon the death of his widow in 1901 the Farm was divided amongst the surviving heirs: for each son, for each daughter, and the homestead plus to his youngest son Benjamin Cromwell Colenso FIELD. Current surviving relatives of J C Field still reside in the highway area: John Padley Field and his daughter Kathleen Merle Field. ===Kloof village=== The further subdivisions and sale of portions of Richmond Farm No. 999 by the Field heirs after 1901 resulted in the birth of Kloof as a residential area: numerous plots were sold to wealthy Durban residents and businessmen, who built country house retreats close to the city, but (due to its 550 m above sea level elevation) removed from the Durban humidity and heat. These were particularly favoured by their wives and children during the long hot summer holidays. From the 1890s onwards the appearance of the area therefore changed significantly, from its previous 'sandstone sourveld' grassland to its current heavily-wooded flora. Kloof was originally called 'Krantzkloof' by J C Field the First, after the nearby Kloof Gorge, but this name was later changed to 'Kloof' at the special request of the General Manager of the Railways, since due to a name similarity with Kranskop there had been significant confusion and misdeliveries of railway goods: the Railway Station was therefore renamed, and the town with it. The current Station building is a replacement of an earlier one, built in 1896, and it remained operational until the closure of this branch of the Durban-Pietermaritzburg railway line to passenger traffic in the 1970s. The building is now being utilised as a popular bar restaurant; it is also the main terminus of the Umgeni Steam Railway. As roads improved, an increasing number of people began permanently living in Kloof and during the 1960s and 1970s, the development of the traditional Kloof houses occurred. These consisted of large houses that were built on stands of at least . Many of the houses have slate roofs, a swimming pool, small guest houses and tennis courts and they are often tucked away amidst the trees. ==Schools== Thomas More College Kloof has a state school network that consists of Kloof High School, Forest View Primary School, Kloof Senior Primary School, Kloof Junior Primary School and Kloof Pre-Primary School. There are also several private schools located in Kloof including Thomas More College and St Mary's Diocesan School for Girls. In the broader area there is also Highbury Preparatory School in Hillcrest and Kearsney College in Botha's Hill. ==Wildlife== The many trees that define Kloof provide for an abundance of birds, including the Crowned eagle. Other wildlife has been preserved in greenbelt areas such as the Krantzkloof Nature Reserve, which includes the Kloof Gorge, and the Everton Conservancy. The Reserve is centered on the main gorge cut by the eMolweni River, and extends in total 532 ha (1,315 ac). It was established by the Natal Parks Board in 1950. The area around the gorge was once the habitat of leopards and a leopard features prominently on the Kloof crest. (The stuffed leopard in the Durban Museum reportedly was shot in the area). Chacma baboon were once re-introduced to the reserve, but unfortunately, after becoming troublesome, were removed. Bushpig may also be found in the reserve. Both would likely have formed part of the diet of the leopard. Many porcupine are still present in open areas like the local Kloof and Upper Highway SPCA grounds. Genet are often found in forest areas frequent trees looking for prey. ==Climate== Average yearly rainfall is , based on records which date back to 1935. The rainy season is from the October to March summer months, while winters tend to be very dry. Summer temperatures range from , with winter temperatures between . ==Botanical gardens== Private botanical gardens which were established by a well-known horticulturalist are now the gardens of a hotel known as the Makaranga Lodge after tall trees planted in the gardens. Visitors are able to arrange guided tours. ==The golf course== The Kloof Country Club includes a highly rated 18-hole golf course, which was the only golf course outside of Durban for many years. The M13 highway runs parallel to it. ==Places of interest== Kloof and Hillcrest seen from the sky The Kranztview Nature Reserve is also home to popular rock climbing routes which are used by beginners and experts. It is one of the stomping grounds of sport and traditional rock climbing and if you are more of a spectator, the gorge has easily accessible hiking trails that lead to breath-taking views. ===Shopping=== *Delcairn Centre *Field's Shopping Centre *Maytime Shopping Centre *The Village Mall *Kloof & Upper Highway SPCA (Tea garden, Nursery, Secondhand shops, Animal Shelter, Trail walks) ===Activity centres=== *Kloof Country Club (golf course, tennis and squash courts, cricket oval, and facilities) *Krantzkloof Nature Reserve and Kloof Gorge *Kloof Methodist Church *Kloof Baptist Church *Kloof Tennis Club *St. Agnes Anglican Church, the church building, dating from the 1950s, was built on a piece of land on the farm section 'Glenholm', owned by T.

The purpose of this mission was to send a number of high level personages from Britain and France to Poland in an attempt to influence Polish policy, possibly through effecting a change in government. The mission members included French diplomat, Jean Jules Jusserand, general Maxime Weygand, chief of staff to Marshal Ferdinand Foch (the Supreme Commander of the victorious Entente), and the British diplomat, Lord Edgar Vincent D'Abernon. The crucial battle of Warsaw was won in the early days of August, before the mission could achieve anything of importance. The only tangible result was the installation of Weygand as an advisor to the Polish General Staff, where his role was negligible.

The family, which derived their kin from the Gediminids dynasty, by the mid-17th century had split into two branches, based in the Klevan Castle and the Korets Castle, respectively. They used the Czartoryski coat of arms and were a noble family of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in the 18th century. The Czartoryski and the Potocki were the two most influential aristocratic families of the last decades of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (1569‚Äì1795).

One of his sons, Vasyli Chortoryiski (Ukrainian: –ß–∞—Ä—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–π—Å—å–∫–∏–π; 1375‚Äì1416), was granted an estate in Volhynia in 1393, and his three sons John, Alexander and Michael (c. 1400‚Äì1489) are considered the progenitors of the family. The founding members were culturally Ruthenian and Eastern Orthodox; they converted to Roman Catholicism and were Polonized during the 16th century. Michael's descendant Prince Kazimierz Czartoryski (1674‚Äì1741), Duke of Klewan and Zukow (Klevan and Zhukiv), Castellan of Vilnius, reawakened Czartoryski royal ambitions at the end of the 17th century. He married Isabella Morsztyn, daughter of the Grand Treasurer of Poland, and built \\"The Familia\\" with their four children, Micha≈Ç, August, Teodor and Konstancja. The family became known and powerful under the lead of brothers Micha≈Ç Fryderyk Czartoryski and August Aleksander Czartoryski in the late Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth of the 18th century, during the reigns Augustus II the Strong (King of Poland, 1697-1706 and 1709-1733) and Stanis≈Çaw I Leszczy≈Ñski (King of Poland 1704-1709 and 1733-1736). The Czartoryski had risen to power under August Aleksander Czartoryski (1697‚Äì1782) of the Klewa line, who married Zofia Denhoffowa, the only heir to the Sieniawski family. The family attained the height of its influence from the mid-18th century in the court of King Augustus III (. The Czartoryski brothers gained a very powerful ally in their brother-in-law, Stanis≈Çaw Poniatowski, whose son became the last king of the independent Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski (). The Czartoryski's Familia saw the decline of the Commonwealth and the rise of anarchy and joined the camp which was determined to press ahead with reforms; thus they sought the enactment of such constitutional reforms as the abolition of the liberum veto. Although the Russian Empire confiscated the family estate at Pu≈Çawy in 1794, during the third partition of Poland, the Familia continued to wield significant cultural and political influence for decades after, notably through the princes Adam Kazimierz (1734-1823), Adam Jerzy (1770-1861) and Konstanty Adam (1777-1866). The Czartoryski family is renowned for the Czartoryski Museum in Krak√≥w and the H√¥tel Lambert in Paris. Today, the only descendants of Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski are Prince Adam Karol Czartoryski (1940- ) and his daughter Tamara Czartoryska (1978- ), who live in the United Kingdom. The descendants of Prince Konstanty Adam Czartoryski live to this day in Poland and have their representatives in the Confederation of the Polish Nobility. ==Coat of arms and motto== The Czartoryski family used the Czartoryski coat of arms and the motto BƒÖd≈∫ co bƒÖd≈∫ (\\"Come what may\\", literally 'let be, that which will be').

Charles David \\"Doc\\" Herrold (November 16, 1875 ‚Äì July 1, 1948) was an American inventor and pioneer radio broadcaster, who began experimenting with audio radio transmissions in 1909. Beginning in 1912 he apparently became the first person to make entertainment broadcasts on a regular schedule, from his station in San Jose, California. ==Early life== Born in Fulton, Illinois, Herrold grew up in San Jose. In 1895 he enrolled in Stanford University, where he studied astronomy and physics for three years, but withdrew due to illness and never graduated. While at Stanford he was inspired by reports of Guglielmo Marconi's demonstrations that radio signals could be used for wireless communication, and began to experiment with the new technology.Charles Herrold: Inventor of Radio Broadcasting by Gorden Greb and Mike Adams, 2003, pages 44-51. After recovering from his illness, Herrold moved to San Francisco, where he developed a number of inventions for dentistry, surgery, and underwater illumination. However, the April 18, 1906 San Francisco earthquake destroyed his work site and apartment. He next took an engineering teaching position for three years, at Heald's College of Mining and Engineering in Stockton, California. While there, his various research projects included the remote detonation of mines using radio signals. During this time he received further inspiration from the novel Looking Backward by Edward Bellamy, which foresaw the transmission of entertainment programming over telephone lines to individual homes. Herrold began to speculate about the possibilities of instead using radio signals to distribute the programming more efficiently.Greb and Adams, pages 53-56. The original spark-gap transmitters used for radio signalling could only transmit Morse code messages. Even with this limitation, there was some broadcasting by early radio stations, beginning in 1905 with daily noon time signals transmitted by U.S. Naval stations.\\"The First Wireless Time Signal\\" (letter from Captain J. L. Jayne), The American Jeweler, October 1912, page 411. (reprint in Electrician and Mechanic, January 1913, page 52) Although these broadcasts generated interest among amateur radio operators,One prominent example was Frank Conrad, who in 1913 built a receiver to pick up time signals, and who in 1919 would go on to begin radiotelephone broadcasts over his station, 8XK, which in turn prompted Westinghouse to establish broadcasting station KDKA. especially after they were expanded to include daily weather forecasts and news summaries, the need to learn Morse code greatly restricted potential audiences. Charles Herrold and assistant Ray Newby (circa 1910) To realize his idea of distributing entertainment by radio, Herrold first needed to perfect a radiotelephone transmitter. He was not unique in this endeavor. Although he would later claim that only he had conceived of entertainment broadcasting, there were actually a few others who had speculated about the possibilities. On December 21, 1906, Reginald Fessenden demonstrated an alternator-transmitter of his own design, and one reviewer noted that it was \\"admirably adapted to the transmission of news, music, etc. as, owing to the fact that no wires are needed, simultaneous transmission to many subscribers can be effected as easily as to a few\\".\\"Experiments and Results in Wireless Telephony\\" by John Grant, The American Telephone Journal, February 2, 1907, page 80. However, Fessenden would almost exclusively focus on point-to-point transmissions intended to supplement the wire telephone system.In 1932, Fessenden claimed to have made two demonstration entertainment broadcasts, on December 24 and 31, 1906, but did not follow up on the idea at the time. Lee de Forest was even more ambitious, although Herrold would later incorrectly assert that \\"Certainly de Forest had no thought of a broadcast\\".Greb and Adams (1934 interview broadcast by KQW, San Jose, California), page 19. As early as June 1907, a review of de Forest's test of his version of a Valdemar Poulsen arc-transmitter noted that \\"the inventor believes that by using four different forms of wave as many classes of music can be sent out as desired by the different subscribers\\".\\"Wireless Telephony by the De Forest System\\" by Herbert T. Wade, The American Monthly Review of Reviews, June 1907, pages 681-685. De Forest made a series of musical demonstrations from 1907 to 1910,\\"Wireless 'Phone Transmits Music\\", New York Herald, March 7, 1907, page 8 (fultonhistory.com)\\"Grand Opera by Wireless\\", Telephony, March 5, 1910, pages 293-294.\\"Radio Telephone Experiments\\", Modern Electrics, May 1910, page 63 (earlyradiohistory.us) although he would not actually begin regular broadcasts until 1916, when vacuum-tube transmitters became available. ==Radio development pre-WWI== Photograph of Charles Herrold's San Jose California radio laboratory, circa 1912. Herrold is standing in the doorway. On January 1, 1909, Herrold opened the Herrold College of Wireless and Engineering, located in the Garden City Bank Building at 50 West San Fernando Street in San Jose, where a huge \\"umbrella-style\\" antenna was constructed atop the building. The college's primary purpose was to train radio operators, for handling communications aboard ship or staffing shore stations. Although he would never get a degree, Herrold became known as \\"Doc\\" as a sign of his student's respect. Ray Newby, just 16 years old, acted as his primary assistant.Newby, by now living in Stockton, California, appeared as a contestant on the September 27, 1965 episode of the television game show I've Got a Secret (rebroadcast on the Game Show Network on May 22, 2008). Newby's \\"secret\\" was \\"I was the world's first radio disc jockey (in 1909)\\". Host Steve Allen displayed a photograph of Newby and Herrold in the small broadcasting studio. At the time Herrold began his work, there was no regulation of radio stations in the United States, and the station was identified by self-assigned call letters, including FN and SJN. Later the Radio Act of 1912 mandated the licensing of stations, and Herrold was issued a license for an Experimental station in late 1915, with the call sign 6XF.\\"Special Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, December 1915, page 2. The \\"6\\" in 6XF's callsign indicated that the station was located in the sixth Radio Inspection District, while the \\"X\\" meant it was an Experimental license. Herrold's primary radiotelephone effort was toward developing a commercial system suitable for point-to-point service. Working with Ray Newby, he initially used high-frequency spark transmitters. In a June 23, 1910 notarized letter that was published in a catalog produced by the Electro Importing Company of New York, Herrold reported that, using one of that company's spark coils, he had successfully broadcast \\"wireless phone concerts to local amateur wireless men\\".Catalog page reproduced in Greb and Adams, page 6. However, the limitations of the high- frequency spark soon became apparent, and he switched to developing refined versions of the Poulsen arc, which was more stable and had better audio fidelity. In early 1912, Herrold was hired as chief engineer of the National Wireless Telephone and Telegraph Company in San Francisco. With hopes that they could develop a highly profitable point-to-point \\"arc fone\\" radiotelephone, he produced a system with good quality audio‚Äîcolloquially described as \\"shaving the whiskers off the wireless telephone\\"\\"2000 Experiments One Part of Task\\", San Jose Mercury News, March 31, 1915, Page 9.‚Äîalthough relatively low powered. A number of successful tests for the U.S. Navy were reported, however, a conflict soon arose between Herrold and the company, and in late 1913 he both resigned and sued NWT&T; on the grounds that he had not been fully compensated for his time and effort. NWT&T; counter- claimed that it had met the terms of its contract and moreover \\"most of the improvements made by Herrold were ultimately abandoned by the company\\".\\"Rival Engineer Testifies\\", San Jose Mercury Herald, April 9, 1915, page 14. The judge sided with NWT&T; and denied Herrold's claim. In addition, despite his attempts to create a transmission system that didn't infringe on the Poulsen arc patents, there were doubts that he had actually achieved this goal. Contemporary review of a July 22, 1912 broadcast. Concurrent with his work for NWT&T;, in July 1912 Herrold began making regular radio broadcasts on a weekly basis from his San Jose school, with an initial broadcast featuring phonograph records supplied by the Wiley B. Allen company.\\"Will Give Concert by Wireless Telephone\\", San Jose Mercury Herald, July 21, 1912, page 27.\\"Musical Concert by Wireless Telephone\\", San Diego Union, July 23, 1912, page 19. Herrold's wife at the time, Sybil, later recounted that she participated in the Wednesday night programs, where she broadcast recordings from the Sherman, Clay record store that had been requested by \\"the little hams\\" (amateur radio enthusiasts) who comprised her audience.Greb and Adams, pages 98-99. Herrold's ultimate transmitter design employed a water-cooled microphone connected to six small arcs burning in liquid alcohol. A review of a Christmas 1916 concert complimented the good audio quality of the \\"Herrold-Portal aerial system of telephony\\", reporting that \\"It was as sweet and beautiful as if it had been played and sung in the next room\\".\\"Concert by Wireless Heard by 300 People\\", San Jose Mercury Herald, December 26, 1916, page 1. Despite the popularity of the broadcasts, they drew only local attention, and were largely unknown outside of the immediate San Jose area. Moreover, the broadcasts came to an end on April 6, 1917, when all civilian station operations were suspended as a result of the entry by the United States into World War I. After dismantling the station, which included removing the antenna system from atop the bank building, Herrold relocated his school to 467 South First Street, a site which also included retail space.Greb and Adams, page 114. ==World War One== Although during the war the school no longer had an operational radio station, there was an extensive need for radio operators, so recruits were trained using Omnigraphs for Morse code instruction. Herrold would later advertise that the school's \\"war record\\" consisted of \\"200 Men Trained‚Äî130 Placed in Service\\".\\"Herrold College of Engineering and Radio\\" (advertisement), Pacific Radio News, October 1921, page 108. At the same time extensive advances were being made in radio transmitter design, with the new equipment employing vacuum-tube technology. Since Herrold had been refining now outdated arc-based systems, much of his technical knowledge was becoming obsolete. ==Radio development post-World War One== Effective October 1, 1919, the wartime ban on civilian radio stations was lifted. Herrold renewed his two expired licenses, 6XE for portable operations\\"Special Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, October 1, 1920, page 5. in the fall of 1920, and 6XF, a standard Experimental license,\\"Special Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, April 1, 1921, page 4. in the spring of 1921. There were still no formal requirements for stations wishing to broadcast entertainment to the general public, and pioneer broadcasting activities, now using vacuum-tube equipment, were being started independently at scattered sites.Perhaps the first was a short-lived series of weekly concerts transmitted from the Glenn L. Martin aviation plant in Cleveland, Ohio beginning April 17, 1919. (\\"Hear Caruso Sing by Wireless Thursday!\\", Cleveland Plain Dealer, April 17, 1919, page 1.) Other significant individuals were Frank Conrad in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, beginning October 17, 1919 over Experimental station 8XK, and Lee de Forest over Experimental station 2XG in New York City in late 1919. One of Herrold's first tasks after the end of the war was to become familiar with vacuum-tube equipment. Although some of his associates later thought that he resumed regular broadcasts as early as 1919, there is no record of him returning to the airwaves prior to early May 1921, presumably over 6XF, when an announcement was made that his school would begin programs on Monday and Thursday nights, playing records supplied by \\"J. A. Kerwin of 84 East Santa Clara street, dealer in phonographs\\".\\"Radio School Sends Jazz Music via Air\\", San Jose Mercury Herald, May 3, 1921, page 4. ==Broadcasting station KQW (later KCBS)== The government eventually adopted a regulation, which took effect on December 1, 1921, requiring that persons wanting to transmit entertainment to the general public had to obtain a Limited Commercial license. Thus, on December 9, 1921, a license with the randomly assigned call sign of KQW was issued in the name of Charles D. Herrold in San Jose.\\"Commercial Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 2. Operation of the broadcasting station was financed by sales of radio equipment by the Herrold Radio Laboratory, but by 1925 the costs for KQW had grown burdensome, and the station was transferred to the First Baptist Church of San Jose. Two conditions of the reassignment were that Herrold be kept on as program director, and the station's sign-ons include the statement: \\"This is KQW, pioneer broadcasting station of the world, founded by Dr. Charles D. Herrold in San Jose in 1909\\".Greb and Adams, page 129. However, at the end of 1926 Herrold's contract with the station which he had founded would not be renewed. A few months later he started working for station KTAB in Oakland, California, primarily in sales. Herrold did not profit financially from his pioneering work, and later became a repair technician in the Oakland, California school district, and a janitor in a local shipyard. Almost forgotten, he died in a Hayward, California rest home on July 1, 1948, aged 72. In the 1940s, CBS attempted to buy its then- affiliate in San Francisco, KSFO. KSFO refused to sell, so CBS purchased KQW and moved it to San Francisco, changing the call letters to KCBS on April 3, 1949. In May 2006, KCBS and KPIX-TV moved their San Jose news bureau to the Fairmont Tower at 50 West San Fernando Street, the location of Herrold's original broadcasts. Although CBS management was not aware of the history of the San Fernando Street address when the move was planned, they quickly recognized and embraced its significance when informed at the bureau's opening celebration. ==Legacy== Herrold sought recognition for his pioneering broadcasts, but with limited success while he was alive. There is general agreement that his San Jose station was the first to transmit entertainment broadcasts on a regular basis, dating back to at least 1912, thus giving him a legitimate claim to the self-proclaimed title of \\"Father of (audio) Broadcasting\\"., Joseph E. Baudino and John M. Kittross, Journal of Broadcasting, Winter 1977, pages 61-83. More problematic is whether to also credit KCBS as the \\"world's oldest broadcasting station\\", which requires considering it to be \\"the direct lineal descendant\\" of Herrold's pre-war broadcasting activities.\\"The Golden Anniversary of Broadcasting\\" by Gorden Greb, Journal of Broadcasting, Winter 1958-1959, page 3. The main issue is Herrold's apparent delay in returning to broadcasting after World War I. A number of stations were already making regular broadcasts in 1920, including some in the nearby San Francisco Bay region, beginning in February 1920 with Emil Portal's broadcast of an orchestra concert from the Fairmont hotel in San Francisco.\\"Local Lad Puts Over Great Test of Radio Phone\\", San Jose Evening News, February 17, 1920. Thus, by restarting in May 1921 Herrold appears to have been merely rejoining the broadcasting ranks, rather than maintaining a continuous presence. Since 1978, the California Historical Radio Society has awarded an annual \\"Charles D. 'Doc' Herrold Award\\", in recognition of \\"Outstanding Achievement in the Preservation and Documentation of Early Radio\\".The Charles D. 'Doc' Herrold Award, California Historical Radio Society. ==References== ==External links== *The History of KQW and KCBS by John F.

The play focuses on the relationship between Henry and Annie, an actress and member of a group fighting to free Brodie, a Scottish soldier imprisoned for burning a memorial wreath during a protest. The Real Thing examines the nature of honesty and uses various constructs, including a play within a play, to explore the theme of reality versus appearance. It has been described as one of Stoppard's \\"most popular, enduring and autobiographical plays.\\" ==Characters== Max: \\"40-ish\\" male actor who begins the play married to Annie. Acts in Henry's new play, House of Cards. Charlotte: \\"35-ish\\" female actor who begins the play married to Henry. Appears opposite Max in House of Cards. Henry: \\"40-ish\\" playwright who, at the beginning of the play, is married to Charlotte and conducting an affair with Annie. Both believe in love and yet approach it with cynicism. Annie: \\"30-ish\\" female actor who begins the play married to Max. She has been conducting an ongoing affair with Henry while also working as an activist for Brodie, a soldier who was arrested and imprisoned for setting fire to a wreath at the Cenotaph. 'Billy: \\"22-ish\\" young actor who plays Giovanni to Annie's Annabella in Tis Pity She's a Whore. Openly shows romantic interest in Annie.

Brodie: \\"25\\" year old soldier imprisoned for setting fire to the wreath at the Cenotaph. Annie takes him up as a cause.Stoppard, Tom. The Real Thing. London: Faber and Faber, 1982. ==Synopsis== Setting: London in 1982 ===Act I=== In the first scene, Max accuses his distant and travelling wife, Charlotte, of adultery. Upset, she leaves. In the second scene, Charlotte's personality appears to have changed and she is now married to a playwright named Henry. The audience is gradually led to realize that Charlotte is an actress, and the first scene was her performance in a play that Henry, her husband, wrote. In the play, the character of Max is played by the husband of a married couple with whom Henry and Charlotte are friends, also named Max. The scene reveals that Charlotte is unhappy with the play. She believes that Henry gives limited development to the female lead in order to show off his wit through the male lead's lines. Max and his wife Annie drop by for a social visit with Charlotte and Henry. Without the benefit of Henry's dialogue, the real-life Max seems superficial. By contrast, his wife Annie is, according to the script, \\"very much like the woman Charlotte has ceased to be.\\" Annie is a devoted activist on behalf of an imprisoned soldier, Brodie, who has been arrested for setting fire to the wreath on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior. Henry mocks her as a sentimental do-gooder, giving offence to Max. But when Annie and Henry are left alone, the scene reveals that their fight was also a performance: they are having an affair, and she agrees to meet him later on the pretext of visiting Brodie in prison. Max discovers the affair, and Annie leaves him to be with Henry. Soon, Henry is reduced to writing television scripts in order to pay alimony to Charlotte. He struggles to write a play about his love for Annie, but finds it difficult to find the right language to express sincere emotion: he can vocalize his feelings but has difficulty expressing them honestly in writing. ===Act II=== Two years later, Henry's play about Annie remains unwritten. Annie asks him to ghost-write a play by the prisoner Brodie, whom she continues to visit. Brodie's anarchist politics, anti- intellectualism, and lack of writing ability are the antithesis of everything Henry values. Annie discounts Henry's distaste and states that what matters is the passion behind the writing. Henry defends the importance of beauty in language and skill in writing using an analogy with a cricket bat: good writing is like hitting a ball with a cricket bat (i.e. something that has been carefully designed and crafted to hit balls in the best manner possible); bad writing is like hitting it with a plank of wood (i.e., something that has the same composition as a cricket bat, and bears it some resemblance, but is ultimately random and inferior). Henry accuses Annie of being attracted to Brodie, and instantly realizes his mistake. When Annie is cast in a production of 'Tis Pity She's a Whore in Glasgow, she must be away from Henry for some time, and Henry visits Charlotte and their daughter Debbie. The teenage Debbie declares that monogamy is a thing of the past, a form of colonization. Henry gently cautions the girl against his own vice of making clever phrases for their own sake, but he is shaken by her cynicism. For her part, Charlotte breezily admits to multiple affairs during their marriage, and tells him that his affair with Annie only caused trouble because he treated it romantically instead of as a source of fun. Henry returns home in a frenzy of jealousy and ransacks his and Annie's apartment searching for evidence of infidelity. His confrontation with Annie echoes the scene from the play he wrote that was performed in the first act of The Real Thing, but Annie has more to say than his imaginary wife did. She admits that she is having an emotional affair with her young co-star Billy, though she claims it is not a physical one; but she refuses to either give Billy up or leave Henry: both romances have a moral claim on her, and Henry must accept this. With pain, he does. Her relationship with Billy seems to come to an end, but there remains a notable distance between her and Henry. Adding strain to the already difficult relationship between Henry and Annie, Brodie is released from prison and visits them. He turns out to be a prize oaf, with all of Henry's arrogance and elitism, but none of the playwright's eloquence. He is highly critical of Henry's ghost work on his television play, and makes several crass comments about Annie. It is revealed that Annie's crusade to free Brodie had not been based on a belief in the righteousness of his cause but rather on a sense of guilt over Brodie's intention in committing his crime, which was to impress her. In the end, Annie throws Brodie out of the house, and peace between her and Henry is restored. The play ends with a phone call from Max, who tells Henry that he is newly engaged. ==Autobiographical elements== There are a number of parallels between Stoppard and his main character: both are middle-aged playwrights known for their exact use of language; both express doubts about Marxism and the politics of the left and both undertake work outside the theatre to keep up their comfortable lifestyles and pay alimony to their ex-wives. With these similarities established, it is only a small step to compare Henry's fictional situation with that of his creator: both men take up with another man's wife and find happiness, while retaining a strong relationship with their children. In Stoppard's case this is reinforced by his relationship with Felicity Kendal, the actress who played Annie in the original staging, although, as Stoppard notes, he developed his plot before Kendal took the role. ==Productions== Felicity Kendal originated the role of Annie and Roger Rees originated the role of Henry. Glenn Close played Annie and Jeremy Irons played Henry in the Broadway production. Close and Irons both won Tonys for their roles, as did Christine Baranski for her featured performance as Charlotte. Supporting players during the play's run on Broadway included Peter Gallagher, Simon Jones, D.W. Moffett, Steven Weber, Cynthia Nixon, and Yeardley Smith. In his review for The New York Times, Frank Rich wrote that \\"The Broadway version of The Real Thing ‚Äì a substantial revision of the original London production ‚Äì is not only Mr. Stoppard's most moving play, but also the most bracing play that anyone has written about love and marriage in years.\\" The play was revived in 1999 with Jennifer Ehle as Annie and Stephen Dillane as Henry. It played on Broadway and at the Donmar Warehouse in London. Ehle and Dillane both won Tony Awards for their roles and the production won the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play. A Broadway revival opened on 30 October 2014, at Broadway's American Airlines Theatre, produced by the Roundabout Theater Company and directed by Sam Gold. Ewan McGregor and Maggie Gyllenhaal starred as Henry and Annie, with Josh Hamilton as Max and Cynthia Nixon, who played the role of Debbie in the original Broadway production, as Charlotte. Unlike previous productions, it received mostly negative reviews. ==Reception== Michael Billington listed The Real Thing as one of the 101 greatest plays ever written. ==Awards and nominations== ;Awards * 1982 Evening Standard Award for Best Play * 1984 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding New Play * 1984 New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best Play * 1984 Tony Award for Best Play * 2000 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Play * 2000 Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play ==ReferencesThe Real Thing study guide, (Archive) from Remy Bumppo Theatre Company Category:1982 plays Category:Broadway plays Category:Drama Desk Award-winning plays Category:New York Drama Critics' Circle Award winners Category:Plays by Tom Stoppard Category:Tony Award-winning plays Category:Plays set in London Category:Metafictional plays ","title":"The Real Thing (play)"},{"id":"1434399","text":"The George R. Brown Convention Center, opened on September 26, 1987, is located on the east side of Downtown Houston, Texas, United States. The center was named for internationally recognized entrepreneur, engineer, civic leader, philanthropist and Houstonian George Rufus Brown (1898-1983). George and his brother, Herman, turned Brown & Root into the world's largest construction and engineering company. Later, he and investors founded, Texas Eastern Transmission Company, which donated six of the 11 blocks required to build the GRB. The center is owned by the City of Houston and managed by the Houston First Corporation. The facility was completed with a price tag of $104.9 million, requiring 30 months and more than 1,200 workers. The 100-foot (30 m) high red-white-and-blue building replaced the obsolete Albert Thomas Convention Center, which was later redeveloped into the Bayou Place entertainment complex in the downtown Houston Theater District. It is the first convention center in the world to have a permanent Bitcoin ATM.

The adjacent hotel is the Hilton Americas-Houston, which is connected to the convention center via two skywalks. The hotel and convention center are not connected to the Houston downtown tunnel system. The project expanded the center from to 1,800,000 square feet (107,000 to 167,000 m¬≤). Three exhibit halls were added to increase exhibition space from to 853,500 square feet (42,000 to 79,000 m¬≤) and sixty-two meeting rooms were added for a total of 105. Completion of the project concluded in November 2003, a few months before Super Bowl XXXVIII. There is also a 3,600-seat General Assembly Theater which can be used for concerts, Broadway shows, conferences, meetings and other events, while Exhibit Hall B3 can be converted into a 6,500-seat indoor arena for concerts and sports using telescopic seating. At the same time, METRORail was completed on schedule (connecting downtown to the Houston Museum District, Texas Medical Center, and Reliant Park), and what is deemed a revived downtown Houston has opened doors to future conventions (in 2004 and 2008, the Texas Democratic Convention was held at the GRB). The International Quilt Festival and International Quilt Market annually draws about 50,000 per year. In 2008, the Discovery Green park was completed across the street and the three-block Houston Pavilions (a retail and entertainment complex, anchored by House of Blues) opened four blocks away. A new 700-car parking garage was built under Discovery Green to replace two surface lots removed to make way for the park. The convention center is flanked by Toyota Center (home of the Houston Rockets) and Minute Maid Park (home of the Houston Astros). With the new improvements, the George R. Brown Convention Center is one of the 10 largest in the nation.City of Houston eGovernment Center In November 2014 the ground was broken yet again, this time in preparation for Super Bowl LI. The latest expansion to the GRB includes converting six lanes and the length of five city blocks into ADLA Plaza, a 97,000-square-foot, pedestrian- friendly, outdoor space. The new Grand Lobby will be 10 stories high and showcase Ed Wilson‚Äôs 60 foot sculpture, \\"Soaring in the Clouds\\", suspended from the ceiling in the very center of the GRB. From there, patrons will have improved connectivity to 550,000 square feet of prime exhibition space via a 95,000 square foot Grand Concourse. Construction is set to be completed in the Fall of 2016. Opened in Fall 2016 and located at the North end of the GRB is the Marriott Marquis, which connects to the GRB via skybridge. This unique property boasts 1,000 guest rooms and a Texas-shaped lazy river. An additional 2,461 rooms are being added to Houston‚Äôs downtown hotel inventory in eight unique properties. By late 2016, there will be more than 7,700 rooms in 24 hotels downtown. After Hurricane Katrina, approximately 7,000 people went to the convention center, due to the Astrodome being at its full capacity. In 2009, a televised audition of the show America's Got Talent was filmed at the convention center. Many graduations from local high schools and colleges are held at the convention center. Houston's largest pop-culture event Comicpalooza draws a massive crowd every year and continues to increase as the convention becomes more popular. == Race history == The original track layout from 1998-2001. From 1998 to 2001, CART held a race on Houston's downtown streets, adjacent to the George R. Brown Convention Center. This event was sponsored by the oil company Texaco, and named the Texaco Grand Prix of Houston. However, construction in downtown Houston resulted in the race not being renewed for the 2002 CART season. ==Gallery== File:ViewDowntownHoustonFromGeoRBrownConvCtr25Apr13.jpgA view of downtown Houston from inside the George R.

From 1935 to 1964, the firm was known as Doar & Knowles. From 1935 to 1940, he served on the St. Croix County Board of Supervisors. Knowles was first elected to the Wisconsin State Senate in 1940, becoming Majority Leader after only two years in office in 1943, but during World War II he took a break to serve as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy aboard the USS Nevada.Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau. The State of Wisconsin Blue Book 1970. Madison: 1970, p. 4. Following his military service, Knowles resumed serving in the Wisconsin State Senate and returned to the leadership position for 5 additional legislative terms until his election as Lieutenant Governor in 1954. Knowles resigned his Senate seat and was succeeded by his brother, Robert, who won an April 1955 special election to finish the unexpired senate term. Knowles was also a delegate to the Republican National Convention several times. Knowles would be re-elected to a second term as Lieutenant Governor in 1956, but was narrowly defeated in 1958 by Democrat Philleo Nash. But Knowles would return and defeat Nash in the 1960 election to reclaim the office for one more term. During his second term as Lieutenant Governor, he entered the crowded field for the special election for the remainder of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's term upon his death in 1957. He placed fourth behind former Governor Walter J. Kohler, Jr. and Congressmen Glenn R. Davis and Alvin O'Konski, receiving 8% of the vote.Wisconsin Legislative Reference Library.

A player's strategy will determine the action which the player will take at any stage of the game. The strategy concept is sometimes (wrongly) confused with that of a move. A move is an action taken by a player at some point during the play of a game (e.g., in chess, moving white's Bishop a2 to b3). A strategy on the other hand is a complete algorithm for playing the game, telling a player what to do for every possible situation throughout the game. A strategy profile (sometimes called a strategy combination) is a set of strategies for all players which fully specifies all actions in a game. A strategy profile must include one and only one strategy for every player. ==Strategy set== A player's strategy set defines what strategies are available for them to play. A player has a finite strategy set if they have a number of discrete strategies available to them. For instance, a game of rock paper scissors comprises a single move by each player--and each player's move is made without knowledge of the other's, not as a response--so each player has the finite strategy set {rock paper scissors}. A strategy set is infinite otherwise. For instance the cake cutting game has a bounded continuum of strategies in the strategy set {Cut anywhere between zero percent and 100 percent of the cake}. In a dynamic game, the strategy set consists of the possible rules a player could give to a robot or agent on how to play the game. For instance, in the ultimatum game, the strategy set for the second player would consist of every possible rule for which offers to accept and which to reject. In a Bayesian game, the strategy set is similar to that in a dynamic game. It consists of rules for what action to take for any possible private information. ===Choosing a strategy set=== In applied game theory, the definition of the strategy sets is an important part of the art of making a game simultaneously solvable and meaningful. The game theorist can use knowledge of the overall problem to limit the strategy spaces, and ease the solution. For instance, strictly speaking in the Ultimatum game a player can have strategies such as: Reject offers of ($1, $3, $5, ..., $19), accept offers of ($0, $2, $4, ..., $20). Including all such strategies makes for a very large strategy space and a somewhat difficult problem. A game theorist might instead believe they can limit the strategy set to: {Reject any offer ‚â§ x, accept any offer > x; for x in ($0, $1, $2, ..., $20)}. ==Pure and mixed strategies== A pure strategy provides a complete definition of how a player will play a game. In particular, it determines the move a player will make for any situation they could face. A player's strategy set is the set of pure strategies available to that player. A mixed strategy is an assignment of a probability to each pure strategy. This allows for a player to randomly select a pure strategy. (See the following section for an illustration.) Since probabilities are continuous, there are infinitely many mixed strategies available to a player. Of course, one can regard a pure strategy as a degenerate case of a mixed strategy, in which that particular pure strategy is selected with probability 1 and every other strategy with probability 0. A totally mixed strategy is a mixed strategy in which the player assigns a strictly positive probability to every pure strategy. (Totally mixed strategies are important for equilibrium refinement such as trembling hand perfect equilibrium.) == Mixed strategy == === Illustration === { align=right -  } Consider the payoff matrix pictured to the right (known as a coordination game). Here one player chooses the row and the other chooses a column. The row player receives the first payoff, the column player the second. If row opts to play A with probability 1 (i.e. play A for sure), then he is said to be playing a pure strategy. If column opts to flip a coin and play A if the coin lands heads and B if the coin lands tails, then he is said to be playing a mixed strategy, and not a pure strategy. === Significance === In his famous paper, John Forbes Nash proved that there is an equilibrium for every finite game. One can divide Nash equilibria into two types. Pure strategy Nash equilibria are Nash equilibria where all players are playing pure strategies. Mixed strategy Nash equilibria are equilibria where at least one player is playing a mixed strategy. While Nash proved that every finite game has a Nash equilibrium, not all have pure strategy Nash equilibria. For an example of a game that does not have a Nash equilibrium in pure strategies, see Matching pennies. However, many games do have pure strategy Nash equilibria (e.g. the Coordination game, the Prisoner's dilemma, the Stag hunt). Further, games can have both pure strategy and mixed strategy equilibria. An easy example is the pure coordination game, where in addition to the pure strategies (A,A) and (B,B) a mixed equilibrium exists in which both players play either strategy with probability 1/2. === A disputed meaning === During the 1980s, the concept of mixed strategies came under heavy fire for being \\"intuitively problematic\\". Randomization, central in mixed strategies, lacks behavioral support. Seldom do people make their choices following a lottery. This behavioral problem is compounded by the cognitive difficulty that people are unable to generate random outcomes without the aid of a random or pseudo-random generator. In 1991, game theorist Ariel Rubinstein described alternative ways of understanding the concept. The first, due to Harsanyi (1973), is called purification, and supposes that the mixed strategies interpretation merely reflects our lack of knowledge of the players' information and decision-making process. Apparently random choices are then seen as consequences of non-specified, payoff-irrelevant exogenous factors. However, it is unsatisfying to have results that hang on unspecified factors. A second interpretation imagines the game players standing for a large population of agents. Each of the agents chooses a pure strategy, and the payoff depends on the fraction of agents choosing each strategy. The mixed strategy hence represents the distribution of pure strategies chosen by each population. However, this does not provide any justification for the case when players are individual agents. Later, Aumann and Brandenburger (1995), re- interpreted Nash equilibrium as an equilibrium in beliefs, rather than actions. For instance, in rock paper scissors an equilibrium in beliefs would have each player believing the other was equally likely to play each strategy. This interpretation weakens the predictive power of Nash equilibrium, however, since it is possible in such an equilibrium for each player to actually play a pure strategy of Rock. Ever since, game theorists' attitude towards mixed strategies-based results have been ambivalent. Mixed strategies are still widely used for their capacity to provide Nash equilibria in games where no equilibrium in pure strategies exists, but the model does not specify why and how players randomize their decisions. ===Behavior strategy=== While a mixed strategy assigns a probability distribution over pure strategies, a behavior strategy assigns at each information set a probability distribution over the set of possible actions. While the two concepts are very closely related in the context of normal form games, they have very different implications for extensive form games. Roughly, a mixed strategy randomly chooses a deterministic path through the game tree, while a behavior strategy can be seen as a stochastic path. The relationship between mixed and behavior strategies is the subject of Kuhn's theorem. The result establishes that in any finite extensive-form game with perfect recall, for any player and any mixed strategy, there exists a behavior strategy that, against all profiles of strategies (of other players), induces the same distribution over terminal nodes as the mixed strategy does. The converse is also true. A famous example of why perfect recall is required for the equivalence is given by Piccione and Rubinstein (1997) with their Absent-Minded Driver game. == See also == * Nash equilibrium * Haven (graph theory) *Evolutionarily stable strategy ==References== Category:Game theory ","title":"Strategy (game theory)"},{"id":"1434442","text":"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour is a stage play by Tom Stoppard with music by Andr√© Previn. It was first performed in 1977. The play criticises the Soviet practice of treating political dissidence as a form of mental illness. Its title derives from the popular mnemonic used by music students to remember the notes on the lines of the treble clef. The cast comprises six actors, but also a full orchestra, which not only provides music throughout the play but also forms an essential part of the action. A chamber-orchestra version also exists. The play is dedicated to Viktor Fainberg and Vladimir Bukovsky, two Soviet dissidents expelled to the West. ==Plot== The play concerns a dissident, Alexander Ivanov, who is imprisoned in a Soviet mental hospital, from which he will not be released until he admits that his statements against the government were caused by a (non-existent) mental disorder. In the hospital he shares a cell with a genuinely disturbed schizophrenic, also called Ivanov, who believes himself to have a symphony orchestra under his command. Alexander receives visits from the Doctor and from a Colonel in the KGB. Meanwhile, his son, Sacha, is seen in a school classroom with a teacher who attempts to convince him of the genuineness of his father's illness. ==Production history== Because of the difficulties in staging a play that requires a full orchestra in addition to the cast of actors, the play is rarely performed. Its 1977 premiere was staged at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee. That performance featured Ian McKellen (Alexander), John Wood (Ivanov) and Patrick Stewart (Doctor), as well as the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Previn. The play was then commercially recorded for RCA Red Seal (RCA ABL1-2855), with Previn conducting the London Symphony Orchestra, and McKellen, Stewart, Ian Richardson, Elizabeth Spriggs, Andrew Sheldon, and Philip Locke as the featured actors. In 1978, the play was produced for television by the BBC. The producer was Mark Shivas and direction was shared by Trevor Nunn and Roger Bamford. The filming was undertaken at a live performance at Wembley Conference Centre in April 1978, conducted by Previn. The cast for this production was Ian McKellen (Alexander Ivanov), Ben Kingsley (Ivanov), Frank Windsor (Doctor), John Woodvine (Colonel), Barbara Leigh Hunt (Teacher), and James Harris (aka Jim Harris) and James Pickering as Sacha. Following its BBC production, the play ran at the Mermaid Theatre in London during the summer and autumn of 1978. Cast changes included John Carlisle taking on the role of the Colonel from John Woodvine, who played Alexander Ivanov, Ian McDiarmid (Ivanov), Rowena Cooper (Teacher) and [Rhys McConochie (Doctor). The role of Sacha was played by a number of young actors including Harris again, and Anthony Robb. Every Good Boy Deserves Favour was the last production at the old Mermaid before it was demolished and redeveloped. In July and August 1979, the play was given a New York City run of eight performances at the Metropolitan Opera House, with a cast featuring Ren√© Auberjonois (Ivanov), Eli Wallach (Alexander), Carol Teitel (Teacher), Remak Ramsay (Doctor), Bobby Scott (Sacha), and Carl Low (Colonel Rozinsky). Patrick Stewart directed and appeared in a 1992 production (produced by Charles Johanson for the Orange County Symphony) which toured to four US cities. The cast included his Star Trek: The Next Generation colleagues Gates McFadden, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner and Colm Meaney. The play was performed in 2002 in Philadelphia as a collaboration between the Wilma Theater and the Philadelphia Orchestra, taking advantage of the fact that Previn had reorchestrated the score for chamber orchestra, making smaller productions possible. In 2008, it was performed at The Town Hall in New York City by the Boston University College of Fine Arts, directed by Jim Petosa and conducted by Neal Hampton, as part of their Incite Festival. This production was revived (director, Jim Petosa, conducted by William Lumpkin) and played the Boston University Theatre in October 2009 and then again for two performances at Maryland's Olney Theatre Center in metropolitan Washington, D.C. In July 2008, the Chautauqua Theater Company at the Chautauqua Institute, in western New York state, performed the play in conjunction with the Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra for the 25th Anniversary Gala of the theatre company. Ethan McSweeny was the director, with conductor Stefan Sanderling, Michael Emerson as Alexander and Brian Murray as Ivanov. In January 2009, London's National Theatre mounted a fully staged theatrical revival on the National's largest stage, the Olivier Theatre, starring Toby Jones, Joseph Millson and Dan Stevens, with the Southbank Sinfonia as the featured orchestra, directed by Tom Morris and Felix Barrett. The production was critically acclaimed and was revived the following year for a second season. Every Good Boy Deserves Favour received its first Carnegie Hall performance by the Toledo Symphony Orchestra on 7 May 2011 as part of the \\"Spring for Music\\" Festival. Cornel Gabara was stage-director for this performance, whose cast consisted of Pete Cross (Alexander), David DeChristopher (Ivanov), Yazan \\"Zack\\" Safadi (Sasha), Kevin Hayes (Colonel), Benjamin Pryor (Doctor), and Pamela Tomassetti (Teacher). In April and May 2019, it was performed for 18 days in Tokyo and Osaka under the title of . ==References* * Category:Plays by Tom Stoppard Category:1977 plays ","title":"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (play)"},{"id":"1434444","text":"In statistics, econometrics and signal processing, an autoregressive (AR) model is a representation of a type of random process; as such, it is used to describe certain time-varying processes in nature, economics, etc. The autoregressive model specifies that the output variable depends linearly on its own previous values and on a stochastic term (an imperfectly predictable term); thus the model is in the form of a stochastic difference equation (or recurrence relation which should not be confused with differential equation). Together with the moving-average (MA) model, it is a special case and key component of the more general autoregressive‚Äìmoving-average (ARMA) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models of time series, which have a more complicated stochastic structure; it is also a special case of the vector autoregressive model (VAR), which consists of a system of more than one interlocking stochastic difference equation in more than one evolving random variable. Contrary to the moving-average (MA) model, the autoregressive model is not always stationary as it may contain a unit root. ==Definition== The notation AR(p) indicates an autoregressive model of order p. The AR(p) model is defined as : X_t = c + \\\\sum_{i=1}^p \\\\varphi_i X_{t-i}+ \\\\varepsilon_t \\\\, where \\\\varphi_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\varphi_p are the parameters of the model, c is a constant, and \\\\varepsilon_t is white noise. This can be equivalently written using the backshift operator B as : X_t = c + \\\\sum_{i=1}^p \\\\varphi_i B^i X_t + \\\\varepsilon_t so that, moving the summation term to the left side and using polynomial notation, we have :\\\\phi [B]X_t= c + \\\\varepsilon_t \\\\, . An autoregressive model can thus be viewed as the output of an all-pole infinite impulse response filter whose input is white noise. Some parameter constraints are necessary for the model to remain wide-sense stationary. For example, processes in the AR(1) model with \\\\varphi_1  \\\\geq 1 are not stationary. More generally, for an AR(p) model to be wide-sense stationary, the roots of the polynomial \\\\Phi(z):=\\\\textstyle 1 - \\\\sum_{i=1}^p \\\\varphi_i z^{p-i} must lie outside the unit circle, i.e., each (complex) root z_i must satisfy z_i>1 (see pages 88,90 ). ==Intertemporal effect of shocks== In an AR process, a one-time shock affects values of the evolving variable infinitely far into the future. For example, consider the AR(1) model X_t = c + \\\\varphi_1 X_{t-1} + \\\\varepsilon_t. A non-zero value for \\\\varepsilon_t at say time t=1 affects X_1 by the amount \\\\varepsilon_1. Then by the AR equation for X_2 in terms of X_1, this affects X_2 by the amount \\\\varphi_1 \\\\varepsilon_1. Then by the AR equation for X_3 in terms of X_2, this affects X_3 by the amount \\\\varphi_1^2 \\\\varepsilon_1. Continuing this process shows that the effect of \\\\varepsilon_1 never ends, although if the process is stationary then the effect diminishes toward zero in the limit. Because each shock affects X values infinitely far into the future from when they occur, any given value Xt is affected by shocks occurring infinitely far into the past. This can also be seen by rewriting the autoregression :\\\\phi (B)X_t= \\\\varepsilon_t \\\\, (where the constant term has been suppressed by assuming that the variable has been measured as deviations from its mean) as :X_t= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\phi (B)}\\\\varepsilon_t \\\\, . When the polynomial division on the right side is carried out, the polynomial in the backshift operator applied to \\\\varepsilon_t has an infinite order‚Äîthat is, an infinite number of lagged values of \\\\varepsilon_t appear on the right side of the equation. ==Characteristic polynomial== The autocorrelation function of an AR(p) process can be expressed as :\\\\rho(\\\\tau) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^p a_k y_k^{-\\\\tau} , where y_k are the roots of the polynomial : \\\\phi(B) = 1- \\\\sum_{k=1}^p \\\\varphi_k B^k where B is the backshift operator, where \\\\phi(\\\\cdot) is the function defining the autoregression, and where \\\\varphi_k are the coefficients in the autoregression. The autocorrelation function of an AR(p) process is a sum of decaying exponentials. * Each real root contributes a component to the autocorrelation function that decays exponentially. * Similarly, each pair of complex conjugate roots contributes an exponentially damped oscillation. ==Graphs of AR(p) processes== AR(0); AR(1) with AR parameter 0.3; AR(1) with AR parameter 0.9; AR(2) with AR parameters 0.3 and 0.3; and AR(2) with AR parameters 0.9 and ‚àí0.8 The simplest AR process is AR(0), which has no dependence between the terms. Only the error/innovation/noise term contributes to the output of the process, so in the figure, AR(0) corresponds to white noise. For an AR(1) process with a positive \\\\varphi, only the previous term in the process and the noise term contribute to the output. If \\\\varphi is close to 0, then the process still looks like white noise, but as \\\\varphi approaches 1, the output gets a larger contribution from the previous term relative to the noise. This results in a \\"smoothing\\" or integration of the output, similar to a low pass filter. For an AR(2) process, the previous two terms and the noise term contribute to the output. If both \\\\varphi_1 and \\\\varphi_2 are positive, the output will resemble a low pass filter, with the high frequency part of the noise decreased. If \\\\varphi_1 is positive while \\\\varphi_2 is negative, then the process favors changes in sign between terms of the process. The output oscillates. This can be likened to edge detection or detection of change in direction. ==Example: An AR(1) process== An AR(1) process is given by: :X_t = c + \\\\varphi X_{t-1}+\\\\varepsilon_t\\\\, where \\\\varepsilon_t is a white noise process with zero mean and constant variance \\\\sigma_\\\\varepsilon^2. (Note: The subscript on \\\\varphi_1 has been dropped.) The process is wide-sense stationary if \\\\varphi<1 since it is obtained as the output of a stable filter whose input is white noise. (If \\\\varphi=1 then the variance of X_t depends on time lag t, so that the variance of the series diverges to infinity as t goes to infinity, and is therefore not wide sense stationary.) Assuming \\\\varphi<1, the mean \\\\operatorname{E} (X_t) is identical for all values of t by the very definition of wide sense stationarity. If the mean is denoted by \\\\mu, it follows from :\\\\operatorname{E} (X_t)=\\\\operatorname{E} (c)+\\\\varphi\\\\operatorname{E} (X_{t-1})+\\\\operatorname{E}(\\\\varepsilon_t), that : \\\\mu=c+\\\\varphi\\\\mu+0, and hence :\\\\mu=\\\\frac{c}{1-\\\\varphi}. In particular, if c = 0, then the mean is 0. The variance is :\\\\textrm{var}(X_t)=\\\\operatorname{E}(X_t^2)-\\\\mu^2=\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_\\\\varepsilon^2}{1-\\\\varphi^2}, where \\\\sigma_\\\\varepsilon is the standard deviation of \\\\varepsilon_t. This can be shown by noting that :\\\\textrm{var}(X_t) = \\\\varphi^2\\\\textrm{var}(X_{t-1}) + \\\\sigma_\\\\varepsilon^2, and then by noticing that the quantity above is a stable fixed point of this relation. The autocovariance is given by :B_n=\\\\operatorname{E}(X_{t+n}X_t)-\\\\mu^2=\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_\\\\varepsilon^2}{1-\\\\varphi^2}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\varphi^{n}. It can be seen that the autocovariance function decays with a decay time (also called time constant) of \\\\tau=-1/\\\\ln(\\\\varphi) [to see this, write B_n=K\\\\varphi^{n} where K is independent of n. Then note that \\\\varphi^{n}=e^{n\\\\ln\\\\varphi} and match this to the exponential decay law e^{-n/\\\\tau}]. The spectral density function is the Fourier transform of the autocovariance function. In discrete terms this will be the discrete-time Fourier transform: :\\\\Phi(\\\\omega)= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}\\\\,\\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty B_n e^{-i\\\\omega n} =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}\\\\,\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_\\\\varepsilon^2}{1+\\\\varphi^2-2\\\\varphi\\\\cos(\\\\omega)}\\\\right). This expression is periodic due to the discrete nature of the X_j, which is manifested as the cosine term in the denominator. If we assume that the sampling time (\\\\Delta t=1) is much smaller than the decay time (\\\\tau), then we can use a continuum approximation to B_n: :B(t)\\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_\\\\varepsilon^2}{1-\\\\varphi^2}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\varphi^{t} which yields a Lorentzian profile for the spectral density: :\\\\Phi(\\\\omega)= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_\\\\varepsilon^2}{1-\\\\varphi^2}\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\pi(\\\\gamma^2+\\\\omega^2)} where \\\\gamma=1/\\\\tau is the angular frequency associated with the decay time \\\\tau. An alternative expression for X_t can be derived by first substituting c+\\\\varphi X_{t-2}+\\\\varepsilon_{t-1} for X_{t-1} in the defining equation. Continuing this process N times yields :X_t=c\\\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}\\\\varphi^k+\\\\varphi^NX_{t-N}+\\\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}\\\\varphi^k\\\\varepsilon_{t-k}. For N approaching infinity, \\\\varphi^N will approach zero and: :X_t=\\\\frac{c}{1-\\\\varphi}+\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty\\\\varphi^k\\\\varepsilon_{t-k}. It is seen that X_t is white noise convolved with the \\\\varphi^k kernel plus the constant mean. If the white noise \\\\varepsilon_t is a Gaussian process then X_t is also a Gaussian process. In other cases, the central limit theorem indicates that X_t will be approximately normally distributed when \\\\varphi is close to one. === Explicit mean/difference form of AR(1) process === The AR(1) model is the discrete time analogy of the continuous Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. It is therefore sometimes useful to understand the properties of the AR(1) model cast in an equivalent form. In this form, the AR(1) model, with process parameter \\\\theta is given by: :X_{t+1} = X_t + (1-\\\\theta)(\\\\mu - X_t) + \\\\epsilon_{t+1}\\\\,, where \\\\theta < 1 \\\\, and \\\\mu is the model mean. By putting this in the form X_{t+1} = c + \\\\phi X_t\\\\ +\\\\epsilon_{t+1}, , and then expanding the series for X_{t+n}, one can show that: : \\\\operatorname{E}(X_{t+n}  X_t) = \\\\mu\\\\left[1-\\\\theta^n\\\\right] + X_t\\\\theta^n, and : \\\\operatorname{Var} (X_{t+n}  X_t) = \\\\sigma^2 \\\\frac{ 1 - \\\\theta^{2n} }{1 -\\\\theta^2}. ==Choosing the maximum lag== The partial autocorrelation of an AR(p) process equals zero at lag which is not bigger than order of p and provides a good model for the correlation between X_1 and X_{p+1} , so the appropriate maximum lag is the one beyond which the partial autocorrelations are all zero. ==Calculation of the AR parameters== There are many ways to estimate the coefficients, such as the ordinary least squares procedure or method of moments (through Yule‚ÄìWalker equations). The AR(p) model is given by the equation : X_t = \\\\sum_{i=1}^p \\\\varphi_i X_{t-i}+ \\\\varepsilon_t.\\\\, It is based on parameters \\\\varphi_i where i = 1, ..., p. There is a direct correspondence between these parameters and the covariance function of the process, and this correspondence can be inverted to determine the parameters from the autocorrelation function (which is itself obtained from the covariances). This is done using the Yule‚ÄìWalker equations. ===Yule‚ÄìWalker equations=== The Yule‚ÄìWalker equations, named for Udny Yule and Gilbert Walker,Yule, G. Udny (1927) \\"On a Method of Investigating Periodicities in Disturbed Series, with Special Reference to Wolfer's Sunspot Numbers\\", Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Ser. A, Vol. 226, 267‚Äì298.]Walker, Gilbert (1931) \\"On Periodicity in Series of Related Terms\\", Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Ser. A, Vol. 131, 518‚Äì532. are the following set of equations. : \\\\gamma_m = \\\\sum_{k=1}^p \\\\varphi_k \\\\gamma_{m-k} + \\\\sigma_\\\\varepsilon^2\\\\delta_{m,0}, where , yielding equations. Here \\\\gamma_m is the autocovariance function of Xt, \\\\sigma_\\\\varepsilon is the standard deviation of the input noise process, and \\\\delta_{m,0} is the Kronecker delta function. Because the last part of an individual equation is non-zero only if , the set of equations can be solved by representing the equations for in matrix form, thus getting the equation :\\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\gamma_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma_p \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\gamma_0 & \\\\gamma_{-1} & \\\\gamma_{-2} & \\\\dots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma_1 & \\\\gamma_0 & \\\\gamma_{-1} & \\\\dots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma_2 & \\\\gamma_{1} & \\\\gamma_{0} & \\\\dots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma_{p-1} & \\\\gamma_{p-2} & \\\\gamma_{p-3} & \\\\dots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\varphi_{1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varphi_{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varphi_{3} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\varphi_{p} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{bmatrix} which can be solved for all \\\\\\\\{\\\\varphi_m; m=1,2, \\\\cdots ,p\\\\\\\\}. The remaining equation for m = 0 is : \\\\gamma_0 = \\\\sum_{k=1}^p \\\\varphi_k \\\\gamma_{-k} + \\\\sigma_\\\\varepsilon^2 , which, once \\\\\\\\{\\\\varphi_m ; m=1,2, \\\\cdots ,p \\\\\\\\} are known, can be solved for \\\\sigma_\\\\varepsilon^2 . An alternative formulation is in terms of the autocorrelation function. The AR parameters are determined by the first p+1 elements \\\\rho(\\\\tau) of the autocorrelation function. The full autocorrelation function can then be derived by recursively calculating : \\\\rho(\\\\tau) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^p \\\\varphi_k \\\\rho(k-\\\\tau) Examples for some Low-order AR(p) processes * p=1 ** \\\\gamma_1 = \\\\varphi_1 \\\\gamma_0 ** Hence \\\\rho_1 = \\\\gamma_1 / \\\\gamma_0 = \\\\varphi_1 * p=2 ** The Yule‚ÄìWalker equations for an AR(2) process are **: \\\\gamma_1 = \\\\varphi_1 \\\\gamma_0 + \\\\varphi_2 \\\\gamma_{-1} **: \\\\gamma_2 = \\\\varphi_1 \\\\gamma_1 + \\\\varphi_2 \\\\gamma_0 *** Remember that \\\\gamma_{-k} = \\\\gamma_k *** Using the first equation yields \\\\rho_1 = \\\\gamma_1 / \\\\gamma_0 = \\\\frac{\\\\varphi_1}{1-\\\\varphi_2} *** Using the recursion formula yields \\\\rho_2 = \\\\gamma_2 / \\\\gamma_0 = \\\\frac{\\\\varphi_1^2 - \\\\varphi_2^2 + \\\\varphi_2}{1-\\\\varphi_2} ===Estimation of AR parameters=== The above equations (the Yule‚ÄìWalker equations) provide several routes to estimating the parameters of an AR(p) model, by replacing the theoretical covariances with estimated values. Some of these variants can be described as follows: *Estimation of autocovariances or autocorrelations. Here each of these terms is estimated separately, using conventional estimates. There are different ways of doing this and the choice between these affects the properties of the estimation scheme. For example, negative estimates of the variance can be produced by some choices. *Formulation as a least squares regression problem in which an ordinary least squares prediction problem is constructed, basing prediction of values of Xt on the p previous values of the same series. This can be thought of as a forward-prediction scheme. The normal equations for this problem can be seen to correspond to an approximation of the matrix form of the Yule‚ÄìWalker equations in which each appearance of an autocovariance of the same lag is replaced by a slightly different estimate. *Formulation as an extended form of ordinary least squares prediction problem. Here two sets of prediction equations are combined into a single estimation scheme and a single set of normal equations. One set is the set of forward-prediction equations and the other is a corresponding set of backward prediction equations, relating to the backward representation of the AR model: :: X_t = c + \\\\sum_{i=1}^p \\\\varphi_i X_{t-i}+ \\\\varepsilon^*_t \\\\,. :Here predicted values of Xt would be based on the p future values of the same series. This way of estimating the AR parameters is due to Burg, and is called the Burg method: Burg and later authors called these particular estimates \\"maximum entropy estimates\\", but the reasoning behind this applies to the use of any set of estimated AR parameters. Compared to the estimation scheme using only the forward prediction equations, different estimates of the autocovariances are produced, and the estimates have different stability properties. Burg estimates are particularly associated with maximum entropy spectral estimation. Other possible approaches to estimation include maximum likelihood estimation. Two distinct variants of maximum likelihood are available: in one (broadly equivalent to the forward prediction least squares scheme) the likelihood function considered is that corresponding to the conditional distribution of later values in the series given the initial p values in the series; in the second, the likelihood function considered is that corresponding to the unconditional joint distribution of all the values in the observed series. Substantial differences in the results of these approaches can occur if the observed series is short, or if the process is close to non- stationarity. ==Spectrum== right right The power spectral density (PSD) of an AR(p) process with noise variance \\\\mathrm{Var}(Z_t) = \\\\sigma_Z^2 is : S(f) = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_Z^2}{ 1-\\\\sum_{k=1}^p \\\\varphi_k e^{-i 2 \\\\pi f k} ^2}. ===AR(0)=== For white noise (AR(0)) : S(f) = \\\\sigma_Z^2. ===AR(1)=== For AR(1) : S(f) = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_Z^2}{ 1- \\\\varphi_1 e^{-2 \\\\pi i f} ^2} = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_Z^2}{ 1 + \\\\varphi_1^2 - 2 \\\\varphi_1 \\\\cos 2 \\\\pi f } *If \\\\varphi_1 > 0 there is a single spectral peak at f=0, often referred to as red noise. As \\\\varphi_1 becomes nearer 1, there is stronger power at low frequencies, i.e. larger time lags. This is then a low-pass filter, when applied to full spectrum light, everything except for the red light will be filtered. *If \\\\varphi_1 < 0 there is a minimum at f=0, often referred to as blue noise. This similarly acts as a high-pass filter, everything except for blue light will be filtered. ===AR(2)=== AR(2) processes can be split into three groups depending on the characteristics of their roots: :z_1,z_2 = \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(\\\\varphi_1 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{\\\\varphi_1^2 + 4\\\\varphi_2}\\\\right) * When \\\\varphi_1^2 + 4\\\\varphi_2 < 0, the process has a pair of complex-conjugate roots, creating a mid-frequency peak at: :f^* = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\cos^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\varphi_1(\\\\varphi_2-1)}{4\\\\varphi_2}\\\\right) Otherwise the process has real roots, and: * When \\\\varphi_1 > 0 it acts as a low-pass filter on the white noise with a spectral peak at f=0 * When \\\\varphi_1 < 0 it acts as a high-pass filter on the white noise with a spectral peak at f=1/2. The process is non-stationary when the roots are outside the unit circle. The process is stable when the roots are within the unit circle, or equivalently when the coefficients are in the triangle -1 \\\\le \\\\varphi_2 \\\\le 1 - \\\\varphi_1. The full PSD function can be expressed in real form as: :S(f) = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_Z^2}{1 + \\\\varphi_1^2 + \\\\varphi_2^2 - 2\\\\varphi_1(1-\\\\varphi_2)\\\\cos(2\\\\pi f) - 2\\\\varphi_2\\\\cos(4\\\\pi f)} ==Implementations in statistics packages== * R, the stats package includes an ar function.\\"Fit Autoregressive Models to Time Series\\" (in R) * MATLAB's Econometrics Toolbox Econometrics Toolbox Overview and System Identification Toolbox System Identification Toolbox overview includes autoregressive models \\"Autoregressive modeling in MATLAB\\" * Matlab and Octave: the TSA toolbox contains several estimation functions for uni-variate, multivariate and adaptive autoregressive models.\\"Time Series Analysis toolbox for Matlab and Octave\\" * PyMC3: the Bayesian statistics and probabilistic programming framework supports autoregressive modes with p lags. * bayesloop supports parameter inference and model selection for the AR-1 process with time-varying parameters.bayesloop: Probabilistic programming framework that facilitates objective model selection for time-varying parameter models. *Python: implementation in statsmodels. ==Impulse response== The impulse response of a system is the change in an evolving variable in response to a change in the value of a shock term k periods earlier, as a function of k. Since the AR model is a special case of the vector autoregressive model, the computation of the impulse response in vector autoregression#impulse response applies here. ==n-step-ahead forecasting== Once the parameters of the autoregression : X_t = c + \\\\sum_{i=1}^p \\\\varphi_i X_{t-i}+ \\\\varepsilon_t \\\\, have been estimated, the autoregression can be used to forecast an arbitrary number of periods into the future. First use t to refer to the first period for which data is not yet available; substitute the known preceding values Xt-i for i=1, ..., p into the autoregressive equation while setting the error term \\\\varepsilon_t equal to zero (because we forecast Xt to equal its expected value, and the expected value of the unobserved error term is zero). The output of the autoregressive equation is the forecast for the first unobserved period. Next, use t to refer to the next period for which data is not yet available; again the autoregressive equation is used to make the forecast, with one difference: the value of X one period prior to the one now being forecast is not known, so its expected value‚Äîthe predicted value arising from the previous forecasting step‚Äîis used instead. Then for future periods the same procedure is used, each time using one more forecast value on the right side of the predictive equation until, after p predictions, all p right-side values are predicted values from preceding steps. There are four sources of uncertainty regarding predictions obtained in this manner: (1) uncertainty as to whether the autoregressive model is the correct model; (2) uncertainty about the accuracy of the forecasted values that are used as lagged values in the right side of the autoregressive equation; (3) uncertainty about the true values of the autoregressive coefficients; and (4) uncertainty about the value of the error term \\\\varepsilon_t \\\\, for the period being predicted. Each of the last three can be quantified and combined to give a confidence interval for the n-step- ahead predictions; the confidence interval will become wider as n increases because of the use of an increasing number of estimated values for the right- side variables. ==Evaluating the quality of forecasts== The predictive performance of the autoregressive model can be assessed as soon as estimation has been done if cross-validation is used. In this approach, some of the initially available data was used for parameter estimation purposes, and some (from available observations later in the data set) was held back for out-of- sample testing. Alternatively, after some time has passed after the parameter estimation was conducted, more data will have become available and predictive performance can be evaluated then using the new data. In either case, there are two aspects of predictive performance that can be evaluated: one-step- ahead and n-step-ahead performance. For one-step-ahead performance, the estimated parameters are used in the autoregressive equation along with observed values of X for all periods prior to the one being predicted, and the output of the equation is the one-step-ahead forecast; this procedure is used to obtain forecasts for each of the out-of-sample observations. To evaluate the quality of n-step-ahead forecasts, the forecasting procedure in the previous section is employed to obtain the predictions. Given a set of predicted values and a corresponding set of actual values for X for various time periods, a common evaluation technique is to use the mean squared prediction error; other measures are also available (see forecasting#forecasting accuracy). The question of how to interpret the measured forecasting accuracy arises‚Äîfor example, what is a \\"high\\" (bad) or a \\"low\\" (good) value for the mean squared prediction error? There are two possible points of comparison. First, the forecasting accuracy of an alternative model, estimated under different modeling assumptions or different estimation techniques, can be used for comparison purposes. Second, the out- of-sample accuracy measure can be compared to the same measure computed for the in-sample data points (that were used for parameter estimation) for which enough prior data values are available (that is, dropping the first p data points, for which p prior data points are not available). Since the model was estimated specifically to fit the in-sample points as well as possible, it will usually be the case that the out-of-sample predictive performance will be poorer than the in-sample predictive performance. But if the predictive quality deteriorates out-of-sample by \\"not very much\\" (which is not precisely definable), then the forecaster may be satisfied with the performance. ==See also== * Moving average model * Linear difference equation * Predictive analytics * Linear predictive coding * Resonance * Levinson recursion * Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck process ==Notes== ==References== * * * ==External links== *AutoRegression Analysis (AR) by Paul Bourke * by Mark Thoma Category:Autocorrelation Category:Signal processing ","title":"Autoregressive model"},{"id":"1434447","text":"A director general or director-general (plural: directors general, directors- general, director generals or director-generals Random House DictionaryCollins English DictionaryMerriam Webster) or general director is a senior executive officer, often the chief executive officer, within a governmental, statutory, NGO, third sector or not-for-profit institution. The term is commonly used in many countries worldwide, but with various meanings. ==Australia== In most Australian states, the director-general is the most senior civil servant in any government department, reporting only to the democratically elected minister representing that department. In Victoria and the Australian Government, the equivalent position is the secretary of the department. The Australian Defence Force Cadets has three Directors-General which are all one- star ranks: *Director-General of the Australian Navy Cadets *Director-General of the Australian Army Cadets *Director-General of the Australian Air Force Cadets ==Canada== In Canada, the title director general is used in the federal civil service, known as the Public Service of Canada. A director general in the federal government is typically not the most senior civil servant in a department. Directors general typically report to a more senior civil servant, such as an assistant deputy minister or associate deputy minister. The title \\"director general\\" is not usually used within the civil services of the ten provincial governments, nor the three territorial governments; instead, these civil services usually use the title \\"executive director\\", or \\"director\\". Deputy ministers are the highest level bureaucrat within the Canadian civil service at the federal, provincial and territorial levels. Deputy ministers are not politicians but professional bureaucrats. Outside the federal, provincial and territorial civil services, some public sector agencies such as school boards in Quebec use the title \\"director general\\". ==European Union== ESO and ESA Directors-general sign cooperation agreement. In the European Commission and the Council of the European Union, each department (called a directorate-general) is headed by a non-political director-general. This is roughly equivalent to a British permanent secretary. ==France== In France, the similar word pr√©sident-directeur g√©n√©ral (PDG) means the highest person in a company, who is at the same time chairman (pr√©sident) of the board of directors and CEO (directeur g√©n√©ral). From 2001 the two charges may be disjointed. The directeur g√©n√©ral d√©l√©gu√© has a role similar to that of a chief operating officer. French ministries are divided into general directorates (directions g√©n√©rales), sometimes named central directorates (directions centrales) or simply directorates (directions), headed respectively by a directeur g√©n√©ral, a directeur central, or a directeur. ==Ethiopia== Prior to the coup d‚Äô√©tat of 1974 which overthrew the government of Emperor Haile Selassie, the chief civil servant of a government ministry or independent state agency was known by the title of Director-General. In contemporary Ethiopia, the head official of independent agencies such as the Information Network Security Agency or the Ethiopian Investment Corporation is titled Director-General, as are second-tier divisions within ministries, below [permanent] secretariats. ==Germany== In Germany, Generaldirektor may be used for the CEO of a large and established concern, corporation, company or enterprise, particularly if subordinates have the title director. The title is, however, unofficial (theoretically any person, and even practically every entrepreneur with one employee, may call himself director-general) and by now largely out of use. Officially a GmbH has a Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer (\\"managing director\\"), an Aktiengesellschaft, and a board of executive directors (Vorstand) with a chairman (Vorstandsvorsitzender). The term is also used by German Institute Taipei, Germany's informal representative mission to the Republic of China (Taiwan), to refer to its head of mission. ==India== In India, there is a Director General of Police and Director General of Income Tax in each state. Each of the Central Armed Police Forces is headed by a Director General or Director-General: the Assam Rifles,Assam Rifles (select About AR, then Directors General), the Central Reserve Police Force,The Central Reserve Police Force Rules, 1955), the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force,The Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force Rules, 1994) the National Security Guard,National Security Guard - Message from the Director General) and the Sashastra Seema BalSashastra Seema Bal - Organisational Structure) are each headed by a Director General, while the Border Security Force The Border Security Force Act, 1968) and the Central Industrial Security ForceThe Central Industrial Security Force Act, 1968) are each headed by a Director-General. The Indian Coast Guard is headed by a Director General (DGICG). ==Italy== In Italy, the direttore generale of a company is a corporate officer who reports to the CEO (amministratore delegato) and has duties similar to a chief operating officer. Some Italian ministries are divided into departments (dipartimenti), which are in turn divided into general directorates (direzioni generali) headed by a direttore generale. Other ministries, which do not have departments, are directly divided into general directorates. In Italian provinces and greatest communes, direttore generale is a chief administrative officer nominated by the president of province or by the mayor. The title of direttore generale is also given to the chief executive of an azienda sanitaria, a local public agency for health services. == Philippines == The word Director-General was used in the Philippines as a highest ranking law enforcer, which means the head of a law enforcement agency. Such agencies are: * Philippine National Police * Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency * Bureau of Corrections ==Russia== A general director is the highest executive position in a Russian company, analogous to a US chief executive officer (CEO), or a UK managing director. The position exists for all Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) legal forms (e.g. joint stock companies (AO) and limited- liability companies (OOO)), except for sole proprietorships (IP). The general director is the \\"single-person executive body\\" of a company. He or she acts without power of attorney to represent the company, and issues powers of attorney to others. His or her powers are defined by the company charter, by decision of the general meeting of shareholders (AO) or participants (OOO), and by the board of directors. ==Spain== In Spain, M√©xico, and other Spanish- speaking countries, the term \\"director general\\" of a company (similar to a US corporation) is either the general manager or CEO of the company. ==South Africa== In South Africa, the term refers to the non-political head of the national government and its departments. Provincial governments also have directors-general and they hold similar roles to their national counterparts. ==Sweden== In Sweden, the cognate word Generaldirekt√∂r (GD) is the generic title for the head of a State agency, unless otherwise prescribed by higher authority. For purposes of English translations, the word Director-General is officially used. ==United Kingdom== In the UK's Civil Service, a director- general is now usually a senior civil servant (SCS) at Pay Band 3 Level who heads up a group of other Directors and reports directly to the Permanent Secretary of a department. For historical reasons, it has also been retained as the professional title of the chief executive officers in some organisations which predate the current SCS structure and therefore may be used by those people despite them working at different pay bands. For example, the head of the UK's internal Security Service MI5 is also called Director- General, despite the fact that the post is at Permanent Secretary (Pay Band 4) level. (See Her Majesty's Civil Service#Grading schemes for details.) The chief executive of the British Broadcasting Corporation also uses the title despite there being no link to the civil service grading structure. ==United States== This term is used in international organisations and government departments, although this sort of position is more commonly called an \\"executive director\\" or \\"managing director\\" in the United States. Typically, the chief administrative officer of an opera company in the US holds the title of \\"General Director\\". Such was the case with singer and conductor Pl√°cido Domingo, who formerly functioned in that capacity for the Los Angeles Opera, as he had previously for the Washington National Opera. In another prominent example, Speight Jenkins served as the general director of the Seattle Opera for over three decades. General directors are often responsible for artistic decisions, such as which operas to perform and which singers to hire, in addition to financial matters. The Metropolitan Opera is one of the few exceptions among US opera houses; the head of its administration is known as a \\"general manager\\" rather than a general director. ==References== .

It is located approximately 10 km south-west of the Wollongong CBD. It is bordered to the west by Farmborough, Cordeaux Heights and Farmborough Heights in the Mount Kembla foothills, the north by Figtree, the east by Berkeley and Flagstaff Hill, site of the Nan Tien Temple, and the south by Kembla Grange. Unanderra is both a residential suburb, mostly to the west of the Princes Highway and industrial, to the east. Along the highway is a strip of commercial ventures such as a Woolworths and several speciality stores. Two distinctive and beautiful buildings in Unanderra are the Catholic Church and the Syriac Orthodox Church. The Immaculate Conception Catholic Church was opened in 1954 and subsequently extended in 1997 and is located at 48 Princes Highway, Unanderra. Saint Thomas Syriac Orthodox Church in Central Road, Unanderra, was opened in 2007. Unanderra has several local attractions including an old school building, several historic houses and a community centre. The community centre is housed in the former Central Illawarra Municipal Council Chambers, opened in 1901. This operated until the merging of the North Illawarra and Central Illawarra chambers to create the City of Greater Wollongong in 1947. The Unanderra Branch Library opened in 1955 within the centre and was enlarged in 1960. The suburb lies on the Illawarra coastal plain, with its west border in the lower foothills of Mount Kembla. From the highway it is possible to see Mount Kembla and it has a distinctly different shape compared to other views of it. ==History== At the time of its founding it was known as Charcoal or Charcoal Creek, the name of a prominent waterway through the area. From the late 19th century Unanderra served as a gateway to the Sydney Municipal markets for produce (apples, beans, peas, milk) from the surrounding area as well as South Kembla, Cordeaux Valley and as far away as Goondarrin.

It is composed of two partnerships, the United Kingdom-based DLA Piper International LLP and the United States-based DLA Piper LLP (US). The two partnerships share a single global board and are structured as a Swiss Verein. ==History== ===Origins=== DLA Piper's origins can be traced back to Thomas Townend Dibb (1807‚Äì1875) and Sir Charles Lupton OBE (1855‚Äì1935). In the reception foyer of DLA Piper (Leeds office), a Victorian bust of Thomas Townend Dibb is displayed as the founder of the firm. He was born in Leeds, in 1807, the son of a physician. He was educated at Leeds Grammar School and qualified in 1829. He then became a partner of Atkinson Bolland & Atkinson, a well established practice at that time and with record of its existence from 1764. DLA can trace its Yorkshire roots back to 1764, when the firm of Barnard & Bolland was established in Leeds. The newly qualified Thomas Dibb became a partner at Barnard & Bolland and added his name in 1829. The three-letter abbreviation used by the firm today - DLA - conceals a complex history of consolidation and name changes. It picked up Lupton, from Nelson Eddison & Lupton in 1920. The firm merged with Broomhead of Sheffield in 1988. The name of the firm as Dibb Lupton & Co. survived intact until the merger with Broomheads of Sheffield in 1988. Following the link with Alsop Wilkinson in 1996, the firm was then known as Dibb Lupton Alsop until around the year 2000, when the name was shortened to DLA. It is now known internationally as DLA Piper, the fourth largest law firm (by revenue) in the world. Sir Charles Lupton had been educated at Rugby school and then Trinity College, Cambridge. He qualified as a solicitor in 1881, practising mainly at Dibb & Co., later Dibb Lupton in Leeds and also Nelson Eddison & Lupton. Lupton was the Lord Mayor of Leeds in 1915‚Äì16. His portrait was painted by royal portraitist Sir Oswald Birley and his wife, Katharine Lupton (n√©e Ashton) - a former Leeds Lady Mayoress - was the sister of Thomas Ashton, 1st Baron Ashton of Hyde. Lupton is the great great granduncle of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.Lupton, C.A. , The Lupton Family in Leeds, Wm. Harrison and Son 1965 Lupton's son was Captain Charles Roger Lupton, the World War I flying ace. Dibb had no children. The Yorkshire Obituary of June 1875 defines Dibb as \\"one of the most influential men in the borough, and for long period the firm, of which he in the course of time rose to be the chief, has had an influential and extensive practice.\\" ===Piper Rudnick and American predecessor firms=== Piper Rudnick was the result of a 1999 merger between the Baltimore-based Piper & Marbury and Chicago-based Rudnick & Wolfe. At the time, the merger was the largest law firm merger in history. The combined firm was known as Piper Marbury Rudnick & Wolfe LLP until April 2002, when the firm shortened its name to Piper Rudnick LLP. Piper Rudnick acquired the Washington, D.C. based lobbying firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand in September 2002. ===2005 to 2010=== In July 2004, UK-based law firm DLA LLP and Baltimore-based law firm Piper Rudnick announced their intention to merge on 1 January 2005. DLA had been the result of a mid-1990s merger between three UK firms, Dibb Lupton Broomhead, Alsop Stevens, and Wilkinson Kimbers. Piper Rudnick agreed to merge with San Diego- based law firm Gray Cary Ware & Freidenrich LLP in October 2004, forming a firm with around 1,300 lawyers and 20 offices across the United States. In December 2004, DLA LLP, Gray Cary and Piper Rudnick, the latter two of which had yet to complete their merger, announced that the partners of each firm had approved a three-way merger. The merger became effective on 1 January 2005 and the new firm was named DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary. The merger was structured in the form of two limited liability partnerships, DLA Piper International LLP, and DLA Piper US LLP (since renamed to DLA Piper LLP (US)), which share a single management board but are not financially integrated. In July 2005, DLA Piper acquired EY Law's 87 lawyer operation in the Commonwealth of Independent States, including offices in Moscow and St Petersburg. In December 2005 DLA Piper opened an office in Beijing, having recruited a team of lawyers from the Beijing office of Coudert Brothers. In January 2006, DLA Piper opened its first office in the Middle East, in Dubai. The firm has since opened offices in Abu Dhabi, Cairo, Doha, Kuwait City, Manama, Muscat, Riyadh and Jeddah. On 1 September 2006, the firm shortened its name to DLA Piper. DLA Piper merged with its Norway-based alliance firm DLA Nordic in the same month, and formed an alliance with the Australia-based law firm Phillips Fox in November 2006, with Phillips Fox rebranding as DLA Phillips Fox at that time. DLA Piper opened offices in Munich, Germany and Warsaw, Poland in 2007. ===2010 to present=== In February 2010, DLA Piper formed an alliance with the Turkish law firm Y√ºksel Karkƒ±n K√º√ß√ºk until 2014. In March 2010 DLA Piper formed an alliance with the Brazil-based law firm Campos Mello Advogados. In January 2011, DLA Piper and DLA Phillips Fox announced their intention to merge. The merger was approved by partners of both firms in February and was completed on 1 May, when DLA Phillips Fox become part of DLA Piper International LLP. Later in the same month DLA Phillips Fox's former New Zealand-based offices separated to form an independent firm. DLA Piper formed an alliance with Venezuela-based law firm InterJuris Abogados in February 2011, which subsequently renamed as DLA Interjuris. In 2016, the Venezuelan firm exited the alliance with DLA Piper and reverted to operating under the name of InterJuris Abogados. In February 2012, DLA Piper opened an office in Mexico City, having recruited a team from Thompson & Knight's office in the city. In January 2013, DLA Piper announced the closure of its Glasgow office and the sale of its Manchester- and Sheffield-based defendant insurance practices to Hill Dickinson. Also in January 2013, DLA Piper opened an office in Seoul in South Korea. On 2 March 2015, DLA Phillips Fox New Zealand became DLA Piper New Zealand. On 17 April 2015, Canadian law firm Davis LLP became DLA Piper (Canada) LLP. On 13 October 2015, DLA Piper announced the opening of an office in Casablanca in Morocco. On 1 November 2016, DLA Piper (Canada) LLP combined with Dimock Stratton LLP and will operate under the DLA Piper name. An office opened in Johannesburg in January 2016. The Danish firm LETT and the Portuguese firm ABBC joined DLA Piper in March 2017 which made DLA Piper the largest law firm in the Nordic region, with offices in Aarhus, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Oslo and Stockholm (DLA Piper has no offices in Iceland). In late June 2017, The New York Times reported the firm had been hit in the ransomware cyberattack which infected their network. No information was compromised or lost. As of June 2017, the law firm was struggling to uncover from \\"vicious computer attacks\\" from the week before.\\"Law Firm DLA Piper Reels Under Cyber Attack, Fate of Files Unclear\\", Fortune, Jeff John Roberts, 29 June 2017 In October 2017, Equifax selected DLA Piper to work on its security breach case in Washington, D.C..\\"Equifax Picks DLA Piper\\", Kevin McCauley, O'Dwyer's, 23 October 2017 In August 2020, DLA Piper received the 2020 Beacon of Justice Award from the National Legal Aid & Defender Association (NLADA). == Offices == DLA Piper is a polycentric firm with over 80 offices in more than 40 countries across the Americas, Asia Pacific, Australasia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East:http://www.dlapiper.com/files/Publication/298c657a-beef-4bb1-9726-f98745ea1c86/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/12d97ceb-3e2d-4044-b538-16a084843bbd/Key_Facts_Document_.pdf == Political contributions == DLA Piper was the twelfth-largest donor to President Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, DLA Piper was one of the top law firms contributing to federal candidates during the 2012 election cycle, donating $2.19 million, 73% to Democrats. By comparison, during that same period Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld donated $2.56 million, 66% to Democrats, while oil conglomerate ExxonMobil donated $2.66 million, 88% to Republicans. Since 1990, DLA Piper has contributed $16.97 million to federal campaigns, and spent over $1 million on lobbying since 2002. As of 2014 it was the fifth largest donor to potential presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. ==Controversy== In 2010, DLA Piper represented Paul Ceglia in his claim that he hired Mark Zuckerberg to create a website that became Facebook and that under the agreement, Ceglia was entitled to ownership of 84 percent of Facebook, then worth multiple billions of dollars. Zuckerberg and Facebook responded that Ceglia had hired Zuckerberg to work on an unrelated site, but Ceglia had fraudulently altered that contract to make it appear to cover Facebook. A DLA Piper attorney told the Wall Street Journal that although he had not seen the original document, he had \\"absolutely 100% confidence that [Mr. Ceglia's] agreement is authentic.\\" Ceglia's document was later, in fact, found to be fraudulent and in 2014, Facebook and Zuckerberg sued DLA Piper and others, claiming Ceglia‚Äôs lawyers \\"knew or should have known that the [initial] lawsuit was a fraud.\\" The suit was later dismissed. ==Notable attorneys, advisors and staff== * Former US Senator George Mitchell was DLA Piper's chairman between 2003 and 2009 As of 2012, he is chairman emeritus. * Michael Castle, former Governor of Delaware, has been a partner at DLA Piper since 2011. *Timothy Clement-Jones, Baron Clement-Jones, Liberal Democrat Peer and former spokesman for the Creative Industries in the House of Lords * Sir Nigel Knowles was managing partner from 1996 to 2015 and global co-chairman from 2015 to 2016. * James Blanchard, former Governor of Michigan and former U.S. Ambassador to Canada, has been partner since 1996 * Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar, former Prime Minister of Spain, has been Senior Adviser to DLA Piper‚Äôs Global Board since 2013 * Ray LaHood, former secretary of the Department of Transportation, has been Senior Policy Adviser since 2014 * Bart Chilton, former US Commodity Futures Trading Commissioner, was senior policy adviser from 2014 to 2017 * Saxby Chambliss, former US Senator, has been partner since 2015 * Douglas Emhoff, attorney and spouse of Kamala Harris ==Notable alumni== * Dick Armey, former U.S. Representative from Texas' (1985‚Äì2003) and House Majority Leader (1995‚Äì2003) * Rudi M.

The Rainbow Serpent or Rainbow Snake is a common deity often seen as a creator god, known by numerous names in different Australian Aboriginal languages, and a common motif in the art and religion of Aboriginal Australia. Not all of the myths of the ancestral being link a rainbow with the snake and not all describe the being as a snake, but there is usually a link with water or rain. Some scholars have suggested that the link between the two suggests the cycle of the seasons, for example blue (winter), red (summer), yellow (spring) and orange (autumn), and the importance of water in human life. When the rainbow is seen in the sky, it is said to be the Rainbow Serpent moving from one waterhole to another and the divine concept explained why some waterholes never dried up when drought struck. There are many names and stories associated with the serpent, all of which communicate the significance and power of this being within Aboriginal mythology. It is viewed as a giver of life through its association with water, but can be a destructive force if angry. The Rainbow Serpent is one of the most common and well-known Aboriginal stories and is of great importance to Aboriginal society. It is one of the oldest continuing religious beliefs in the world and continues to be a cultural influence today. == Names in different cultures == alt=Myndie as represented by Aborigines of Victoria, circa 1878. The Rainbow Serpent is known by different names by the many different Aboriginal sub-cultures. The Rainbow Serpent (or Serpents if there are more than one) is known as Borlung by the Miali, Dhakkan (or Takkan) by the Kuli, Kajura by the Ingarda, Goorialla by the Lardil people, Kunmanggur by the Murinbata, Ngalyod by the Kunwinjku, Numereji by the Kakadu, Taipan by the Wikmunkan, Tulloun by the Mitakoodi, Wagyl by the Noongar, Wanamangura by the Talainji, and Witij/Wititj by the Yolngu. Other names include Bolung, Galeru, Julunggul, Kanmare, Langal, Myndie, Muit, Ungur, Wollunqua, Wonambi, Wonungar, Worombi, Yero, Yingarna, and Yurlungur. The Dictionary of World Mythology (1997) cites Yurlungur as the Murngin (Yolngu) name for a great copper python (perhaps copperhead) who is \\"the great father\\", the \\"rainbow serpent.\\" == Development of concept == Though the concept of the Rainbow Serpent has existed for a very long time in Aboriginal Australian cultures, it was introduced to the wider world through the work of anthropologists. In fact, the name Rainbow Serpent or Rainbow Snake appears to have been coined in English by Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, an anthropologist who noticed the same concept going under different names among various Aboriginal Australian cultures, and called it \\"the rainbow-serpent myth of Australia.\\" It has been suggested that this name implies that there is only one Rainbow Serpent, when the concept actually varies quite a bit from one Aboriginal culture to another, and should be properly called the Rainbow Serpent myths of Australia. Similarly, it has been suggested that the Serpent's position as the most prominent creator god in the Australian tradition has largely been the creation of non-Aboriginal anthropologists. Another error of the same kind is the way in which Western-educated people, with a cultural stereotype of Greco-Roman or Norse myths, tell the Aboriginal stories in the past tense. For the indigenous people of Australia, the stories are everywhenpast, present and future.Stanner, W. (1968), \\"After the Dreaming\\" (ABC Boyer Lecture Series) == Characteristics and associations == Dreamtime (or The Dreaming or Tjukurrpa or Jukurrpa) stories tell of the great spirits and totems during creation, in animal and human form that moulded the barren and featureless earth. The Rainbow Serpent came from beneath the ground and created huge ridges, mountains, and gorges as it pushed upward. The Rainbow Serpent is understood to be of immense proportions and inhabits deep permanent waterholes and is in control of life's most precious resource, water. In some cultures, the Rainbow Serpent is considered to be the ultimate creator of everything in the universe. In some cultures, the Rainbow Serpent is male; in others, female; in yet others, the gender is ambiguous or the Rainbow Serpent is hermaphroditic or bisexual, thus an androgynous entity. Some commentators have suggested that the Rainbow Serpent is a phallic symbol, which fits its connection with fertility myths and rituals. When the Serpent is characterized as female or bisexual, it is sometimes depicted with breasts. Other times, the Serpent has no particular gender. The Serpent has also been known to appear as a scorpion or another animal or creature. In some stories, the Serpent is associated with a bat, sometimes called a \\"flying fox\\" in Australian English, engaged in a rivalry over a woman. Some scholars have identified other creatures, such as a bird, crocodile, dingo, or lizard, as taking the role of the Serpent in stories. In all cases, these animals are also associated with water. The Rainbow Serpent has also been identified with the bunyip, a fearful, water-hole dwelling creature in Australian mythology. The sometimes unpredictable Rainbow Serpent (in contrast to the unyielding sun) replenishes the stores of water, forming gullies and deep channels as the Rainbow Serpent slithers across the landscape.http://www.bom.gov.au/iwk/climate_culture/rainbow_serp.shtml In this belief system, without the Serpent, no rain would fall and the Earth would dry up. In other cultures, the Serpent is said to come to stop the rain. In addition to the identification with the rainbow, the Serpent is also identified with a prismatic halo around the moon that can be regarded as a sign of rain. The Rainbow Serpent is sometimes associated with human blood, especially circulation and the menstrual cycle, and considered a healer. Thunder and lightning are said to stem from when the Rainbow Serpent is angry, and the Serpent can even cause powerful rainstorms and cyclones. Quartz crystal and seashells are also associated with the Rainbow Serpent and are used in rituals to invoke it. The identification with quartz crystal presumably results from its prism-like appearance. == Serpent stories == Stories about the Rainbow Serpent have been passed down from generation to generation. The Serpent story may vary however, according to environmental differences. Tribes of the monsoonal areas depict an epic interaction of the sun, Serpent, and wind in their Dreamtime stories, whereas tribes of the central desert experience less drastic seasonal shifts and their stories reflect this. It is known both as a benevolent protector of its people (the groups from the country around) and as a malevolent punisher of law breakers. The Rainbow Serpent's mythology is closely linked to land, water, life, social relationships, and fertility. The Rainbow Serpent often takes part in transitions from adolescence to adulthood for young men and swallows them to vomit them up later. The most common motif in Rainbow Serpent stories is the Serpent as creator, with the Serpent often bringing life to an empty space. The most common Rainbow Serpent myth is the story of the Wawalag or Wagilag sisters. According to legend, the sisters are traveling together when the older sister gives birth, and her blood flows to a waterhole where the Rainbow Serpent lives. In another version of the tale, the sisters are traveling with their mother, Kunapipi, all of whom know ancient secrets, and the Serpent is merely angered by their presence in its area. The Rainbow Serpent then traces the scent back to the sisters sleeping in their hut, a metaphor for the uterus. The Rainbow Serpent enters, a symbolic representation of a snake entering a hole, and eats them and their children. However, the Rainbow Serpent regurgitates them after being bitten by an ant, and this act creates Arnhem Land. Now, the Serpent speaks in their voices and teaches sacred rituals to the people living there. Another story is from the Great Sandy Desert area in the northern part of Western Australia. This story explains how the Wolfe Creek Crater, or Kandimalal, was created by a star falling from heaven, creating a crater in which a Rainbow Serpent took up residence, though in some versions it is the Serpent which falls from heaven and creates the crater. The story sometimes continues telling of how an old hunter chased a dingo into the crater and got lost in a tunnel created by the Serpent, never to be found again, with the dingo being eaten and spat out by the Serpent. Another legend from Western Australia tells of how Rainbow Serpents, or Wagyls, smashed and pushed boulders around to form trails on Mount Matilda, along with creating waterways such as the Avon River. A myth from the Northern Territory tells of how a great mother arrives from the sea, traveling across Australia and giving birth to the various Aboriginal tribes. In some versions, the great mother is accompanied by the Rainbow Serpent (or Lightning Snake), who brings the wet season of rains and floods. Some Aboriginals in the Kimberley regions believe that it was the Rainbow Serpent who deposited spirit-children throughout pools in which women become impregnated when they wade in the water. This process is sometimes referred to as \\"netting a fish\\". A more children-friendly version of the Rainbow Serpent myth tells of how a serpent rose through the Earth to the surface, where she summoned frogs, tickled their bellies to release water to create pools and rivers, and is now known as the mother of life. Another children-friendly tale is told in Dick Roughsey's children's book, which tells how the Rainbow Serpent creates the landscape of Australia by thrashing about and, by tricking and swallowing two boys, ends up creating the population of Australia by various animal, insect, and plant species. == Possible origins in nature == thumb image_width = 250px Wonambi naracoortensis and Thylacoleo The Carpet snake is considered a form that the Rainbow Serpent can take by the Walmadjari people. Furthermore, four snakes may have served as inspiration for the Rainbow Serpent. These include the Scrub or Amethystine python, the Taipan, and the File snake, each of which possesses a characteristic that was associated with the Rainbow Serpent, however the most likely inspiration for the Rainbow Serpent is speculated to be the Water python (Liasis fuscus) In Queensland, a fossil of a snake was found, and they believe that it came from the prehistoric family of large snakes that may have inspired the original Rainbow Serpent. Wonambi is a genus that consisted of two species of very large snakes. These species were not pythons, like Australia's other large constrictors of the genus Morelia, and are currently classified in the extinct family Madtsoiidae that became extinct elsewhere in the world 55 million years in the past. Aboriginal people describe this serpent as having \\"hair\\" around its head and face. == Role in traditional culture == In addition to stories about the Rainbow Serpent being passed down from generation to generation, the Rainbow Serpent has been worshiped through rituals and has also inspired cultural artifacts such as artwork and songs, a tradition which continues today. There are many ancient rituals associated with the Rainbow Serpent that are still practiced today. The myth of the Wawalag sisters marks the importance of the female menstruation process and led to the establishment of the Kunapipi blood ritual of the goddess, in which the indigenous Australians allegorically recreate the Rainbow Serpent eating the Wawalag sisters through dance and pantomime, and can be regarded as a fertility ritual. Female menstruation is sacred to many indigenous Australian cultures because it distinguishes the time when a female is capable of bringing life into the world, putting a woman on the same level of creative abilities as the Rainbow Serpent. It is for this reason that men will attempt to mimic this holy process by cutting their arms and/or penises and letting their blood run over their own bodies, each other's bodies, and even into a woman's uterus. Men will sometimes mix their blood with a women's menstrual blood, letting them flow together in a ceremonial unification of the sexes. The earliest known rock drawings of the Rainbow Serpent date back to more than 6,000 years ago. Because of its connections with fertility, the Rainbow Serpent is often illustrated as a vagina, and vice versa. Some rock art has been discovered in which the Rainbow Serpent was drawn mouth open and tongue out to represent the vaginal opening and streaming menstrual blood. The Rainbow Serpent is also identified as a healer and can pass on its properties as a healer to humans through a ritual. == Influence in modern culture == Sidney Nolan's Snake (1970-72), held at the Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart, is a giant Rainbow Serpent mural made of 1620 painted panels. The Rainbow Serpent, in addition to the continuation of traditional beliefs (which can be the subject of religious controversy), is often referenced in modern culture by providing inspiration for art, film, literature, music, religion, and social movements. For example, The Rainbow Serpent Festival, an annual music festival in Australia, and the Rainbow Serpent Project, a series of films which document the filmmaker's journey to various sacred sites around the Earth, are both inspired and named after the creature. Furthermore, the Rainbow Serpent is used in art as a subject, even as an assignment in art classes. For children, it is often used to teach colors and symbolism; for older art students, it is used to teach painting techniques. Many Aboriginal Australian artists continue to be inspired by the Rainbow Serpent and use it as a subject in their art. The Rainbow Serpent has also appeared as a character in literature. The Lardil people's Dreaming story of the Rainbow Serpent was retold in Dick Roughsey's award-winning Australian children's book The Rainbow Serpent; the Rainbow Serpent has also appeared as a character in comic books such as Hellblazer. The Rainbow Serpent, under the name Yurlungur, has featured as a demon or persona in several titles of the Megami Tensei series of Japanese role-playing games. The Rainbow Serpent can still serve a religious role today, particularly for Aboriginal Australians, but some Aboriginal Australians who are Christians reject the belief and resent its identification with Aboriginal culture. Some New Age religions and spirituality movements around the world have now also adopted the Rainbow Serpent as an icon. Similarly, the Rainbow Serpent can inspire social movements. Art historian Georges Petitjean has suggested that the identification of the Rainbow Serpent with various genders and sexualities helps to explain why the rainbow flag has been adopted as the symbol of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities. Politically, for example, the Rainbow Serpent was adopted as the symbol of an anti-uranium mining campaign in Australia, using the notion that the mining would disturb the Serpent and cause it to seek revenge as a metaphor for environmental destruction. ==See also== * *Serpent (symbolism) *Eingana *Wirnpa ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * A Rainbow Serpent myth accompanying Jimmy Njiminjuma bark painting Accessed 8 July 2008 * Explaining Northern Land Council's use of the Rainbow Serpent in its logo Accessed 8 July 2008 * First Australians television series Accessed 29 April 2013 * The Trails of the Rainbow Serpents short film Accessed 3 May 2013 * iDIDJ Australia: Australian Didgeridoo Cultural Hub Category:Rainbow serpent deities ","title":"Rainbow Serpent"},{"id":"1434474","text":"The Diocese of St Albans forms part of the Province of Canterbury in England and is part of the wider Church of England, in turn part of the worldwide Anglican Communion. The diocese is home to more than 1.6 million people and comprises the historic Counties of Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire, or in terms of local government areas, Bedfordshire, Luton, Hertfordshire and parts of the London Borough of Barnet. It therefore ranges from small rural communities in villages and hamlets to major urban centres like Luton, Bedford, Watford and Hemel Hempstead, and includes suburban areas on London's outer reaches. == History== The diocese was founded by an Order in Council on 30 April 1877, implementing the Bishopric of St Albans Act 1875. The diocese was established from parts of the large Diocese of Rochester, extending the new bishop's jurisdiction over more than 600 parishes in the two counties of Essex and Hertfordshire. The first Bishop of St Albans was Thomas Legh Claughton, who served from 1877 to 1890. The see is in the City of St Albans, where the cathedra (bishop's seat) is located in St Albans Cathedral. The cathedral building itself dates from 1077. It was an abbey church (part of St Albans Abbey) prior to its dissolution in 1539, and then a parish church (purchased by the town in 1553) until its elevation to cathedral status in 1877. In 1914, the new Diocese of Chelmsford was formed, removing Essex from the St Albans diocese. A few months later the county Archdeaconry of Bedford was added from the Diocese of Ely, thereby providing the diocese substantially with its current boundaries. The suffragan bishopric of Bedford was revived in 1879 and again in 1935 and that of Hertford was created in 1968. ==Current geographical limits and structure== The diocese currently includes: *the county of Bedfordshire *the county of Hertfordshire *parts of the London Borough of Barnet The diocese is overseen by the Bishop of St Albans, whose cathedra (or seat) is in St Albans Cathedral. He is supported in his pastoral work in the diocese by two suffragan bishops, the Bishop of Hertford and the Bishop of Bedford as well as three archdeacons. The diocese is divided into three archdeaconries: *Archdeaconry of St Albans **includes the deaneries of Aldenham, Berkhamsted, Hemel Hempstead, Hitchin, Rickmansworth, St Albans, Watford and Wheathampstead *Archdeaconry of Bedford **includes the deaneries of Ampthill, Bedford, Biggleswade, Dunstable, Elstow, Luton, Sharnbrook and Shefford *Archdeaconry of Hertford **includes the deaneries of Barnet, Bishop's Stortford, Buntingford, Cheshunt, Hertford & Ware, Stevenage and Welwyn & Hatfield The diocesan offices are located in Holywell Hill in St Albans. ===Bishops=== The Bishop of St Albans (Alan Smith) leads the diocese, and is assisted by the Bishops suffragan of Bedford (Richard Atkinson) and of Hertford (Michael Beasley). The suffragan see of Bedford was created by the Suffragan Bishops Act 1534 but went into abeyance after one incumbent; that see was next filled in the late 19th century and has been in near-constant use again since 1935. The See of Hertford was created by Order in Council of 5 July 1889, but remained dormant until first filled in December 1967.Diocese of St Albans ‚Äì A History of the Sees of Hertford and Bedford (Accessed 20 August 2014) Alternative episcopal oversight (for parishes in the diocese which reject the ministry of priests who are women) is provided by the provincial episcopal visitor, Norman Banks, Bishop suffragan of Richborough, who is licensed as an honorary assistant bishop of the diocese in order to facilitate his work there.

Headquartered in Atlanta, the lottery takes in over US$1 billion yearly. By law, half of the money goes to prizes, one-third to education, and the remainder to operating and marketing the lottery. The education money funds the HOPE Scholarship, and has become a successful model for other lotteries, including the South Carolina Education Lottery. ==History== A government-run lottery was explicitly allowed in a 1992 constitutional amendment to Article I, Section II, Paragraph VIII of the Georgia State Constitution, approved in a referendum. The GLC was created by a separate bill in 1992 by the Georgia General Assembly, and then-governor of Georgia, Zell Miller, in the Lottery for Education Act (OCGA 50-27). Rebecca Paul, who began the Florida Lottery, then ran the Georgia Lottery for its first decade, before leaving to launch Tennessee Lottery in 2004. The original in-house weekly jackpot game, Lotto Georgia, merged with two similar games in 2001 to become Lotto South, in an attempt create larger jackpots. In February 2006, Lotto South ended. In the mid-1990s, Georgia, then offering Powerball for the first time, joined The Big Game (now Mega Millions) when it began in 1996. Several days after Georgia began selling The Big Game tickets, it was forced to leave the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), which continues to administer Powerball. (In October 2009, an agreement was reached between Mega Millions and the Powerball group allowing Mega Millions and Powerball tickets to be available, simultaneously, by each US lottery. Most lotteries, including Georgia's, offered both games beginning January 31, 2010. ==Georgia-only games== ===Instant games=== Instant games are scratch tickets also called \\"scratch-offs\\". A player scratches a thin film from the ticket to see if the ticket is a winner. The prizes are smaller than other lottery games, but there are better odds. There are dozens of instant games on sale at any time, and the selection of games changes frequently. They range in price from $1 to $30. ===Cash 3=== Cash 3 is played three times daily. Three machines, each containing balls numbered 0 through 9, are used; one ball is drawn from each machine. Play styles vary: for example, a $1 \\"straight\\" bet (a player guesses a three-digit number will be drawn in exact order) pays $500 for a winning ticket. Other options of play include \\"Box\\" (any order), \\"Straight Box\\"($.50 for a straight play and $.50 for a boxed play), Front Pair (where you must match the first two numbers drawn in the exact order), and Back Pair (where you must match the last two numbers drawn in the exact order). Cash 3 began August 10, 1993. The first Cash 3 numbers that were drawn were 1-7-0. ===Cash 4=== Cash 4 also is drawn three times daily; it is played similarly to Cash 3, except four ball machines are used. A $1 \\"straight\\" wager (see above) wins $5,000 for a winning ticket. Cash 4 began April 6, 1997. ===Georgia Five=== Georgia Five is a 5-digit numbers game. Georgia 5 is drawn twice daily; it has a top prize of $10,000. It was introduced on August 1, 2010. Georgia Five is different from most pick-3 and pick-4 games; players do not choose straight, box, or similar wagers. The top prize is won by matching all five numbers in exact order; a player wins by matching at least the first or last digit (the ways to win are shown here). ===Fantasy 5=== Fantasy 5 is a once daily game that draws 5 of 42 numbers(was 39 before 10-04-2015). Games are $1 per play. Jackpots begin at $125,000 and increase if there is no top prize winner. Fantasy 5 also has an eZmatch option for an additional $1 per game. Matching the ticket's Fantasy 5 numbers to any of the eZmatch numbers within the ticket wins a cash prize. The eZmatch option can be won up to five times on each ticket. Fantasy 5 has been played since November 14, 1994. ===Keno=== Keno is played every four minutes at many lottery retailers. Twenty numbers from 1 through 80 are selected and displayed on a monitor. Players choose 1 to 10 numbers. Keno has a multiplier option, for an extra $1 per play, that multiplies prizes by 1x, 2x, 3x, 5x or 10x. ==Multistate games== ===Cash4Life=== Georgia joined Cash4Life on August 29, 2016. (The game also is available in Florida, Indiana, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia.) Players choose 5 of 60 numbers in one field, and 1 of 4 green \\"Cash Ball\\" numbers in the second field. Live drawings are held on Monday and Thursday evenings at 9pm Eastern Time on Livestream. The top prize (win or share) $1,000-per-day-for-life. Second prize is $1,000-per-week-for- life.https://www.galottery.com/en-us/games/draw-games/cash-for-life.html#tab- oddsAndPrizeshttps://livestream.com/Cash4Life/events/5051567 Unlike the former multi-state draw game Win for Life (see below), winners of a \\"lifetime\\" prize can choose cash in lieu of the lifetime annuity. ===Mega Millions=== In the mid-1990s, Georgia helped launch The Big Game (now Mega Millions) when it began in 1996. (Its drawings usually are held in Atlanta.) Mega Millions players choose six numbers for $2; five \\"white ball\\" numbers, 1 through 70, and a sixth (Mega Ball) number, 1 through 25. (The Mega Ball number can be a duplicate of a \\"white ball\\" number.) The minimum jackpot is $40 million. Mega Millions replaced The Big Game in 2002. The Megaplier option, initially available only in Texas, was made available to Georgia's players on November 7, 2010. ===Powerball=== In October 2009, an agreement was reached allowing Mega Millions and Powerball tickets to be sold through US lotteries then with either game. Georgia, which joined Powerball in 1995, and sold The Big Game and Powerball tickets for a few days in 1996 before being forced out of Powerball, rejoined Powerball on January 31, 2010. Powerball began in 1992; the Power Play option in 2001. In January 2012, the price of a Powerball play increased to $2, or $3 with Power Play. ====Former multi-state games==== Monopoly Millionaires' Club Monopoly Millionaires' Club (MMC) began sales on October 19, 2014 in 22 states and the District of Columbia. Due to unexpectedly poor sales, and an unexpected early jackpot win, only 10 MMC drawings were held. A television game show featuring MMC contestants aired from March 28, 2015 to 2016; later episodes were for contestants who won access to the show via a scratch ticket; the scratch tickets were printed after the draw game ended. Decades of Dollars Decades of Dollars began in 2011; it was launched in Georgia, Kentucky, and Virginia as an alternative game to Win for Life. (Arkansas joined a few months after DoD began.) DoD was replaced by Monopoly Millionaires‚Ä≤ Club in Arkansas, Georgia, and Kentucky; in 2015, Virginia ended sales of DoD. Winners had the choice of $250,000 per year in 30 installments, or $4,000,000 cash. Win for Life Win for Life replaced Lotto South in 2006. It was offered in Georgia, Kentucky, and Virginia; it was a 6-of-42 game that drew a seventh number (the \\"Free Ball\\") for lower-tier prizes. Top prize was $1,000-a-week- for-life; there was never a gamewide \\"cash option\\", unlike the current Cash4Life (although Virginia offered it when the game began.) Win for Life ended as a Virginia-only game with a cash option. Lotto South Lotto South was offered in Georgia, Kentucky, and Virginia from 2001 to 2006 (it was a 6-of-49 game, using the same matrix as the Virginia-only game that preceded it.) ==References== ==External links== * Category:State lotteries of the United States Category:1992 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:1992 referendums ","title":"Georgia Lottery"},{"id":"1434512","text":"Alphonso Johnson (born 2 February 1951) is an American jazz bassist active since the early 1970s. Johnson was a member of the influential jazz fusion group Weather Report from 1973 to 1975, and has performed and recorded with numerous high-profile rock and jazz acts including Santana, Phil Collins, members of the Grateful Dead, and Chet Baker. ==Biography== Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Johnson started off as an upright bass player, but switched to the electric bass in his late teens. Beginning his career in the early 1970s, Johnson showed innovation and fluidity on the electric bass. He sessioned with a few jazz musicians before landing a job with Weather Report, taking over for co-founding member Miroslav Vitous. Johnson debuted with Weather Report on the album Mysterious Traveller. He appeared on two more Weather Report albums: Tale Spinnin' (1975) and Black Market (1976) before he left the band to work with drummer Billy Cobham. During 1976-77 he recorded three solo albums as a band leader, for the Epic label, in a fusion-funk vein. Johnson was one of the first musicians to introduce the Chapman Stick to the public. In 1977 his knowledge of the instrument offered him a rehearsal with Genesis, who were looking for a replacement for guitarist Steve Hackett. Being more of a bassist than a guitarist, Johnson instead recommended his friend ex- Sweetbottom guitarist and fellow session musician Daryl Stuermer, who would go on to remain a member of Genesis's touring band until the 2007 reunion tour. Johnson was one of two bass players on Phil Collins's first solo album, Face Value, in 1981. In early 1982, Johnson joined Grateful Dead member Bob Weir's side project Bobby and the Midnites. He would reunite with Weir in 2000, playing bass in place of Phil Lesh on tour with The Other Ones. He has also performed fusion versions of Grateful Dead songs alongside Billy Cobham in the band Jazz Is Dead. In 1996, Johnson played bass on tracks Dance on a Volcano and Fountain of Salmacis on Steve Hackett's Genesis Revisited album. Later in 1996, Johnson toured Europe and Japan with composer and saxophonist Wayne Shorter, pianist James Beard, drummer Rodney Holmes, and guitarist David Gilmore. In the fall of 2011 he began working toward a music education degree at the Department of Music at California State University, Northridge. He has an extensive experience as a bass teacher and has conducted bass seminars and clinics in Germany, England, France, Scotland, Ireland, Japan, Switzerland, Australia, Brazil and Argentina. Johnson serves as an adjunct instructor at the University of Southern California and the California Institute of the Arts. ==Equipment== === Electric basses=== * Lobue Custom * Warwick Alphonso Johnson Custom Shop Bass Guitar * Warwick Infinity * Vigier Arpege 5 fretless * Modulus Quantum 5 String Fretted and Fretless Bass ===Acoustic basses=== * Washburn AB45 ==Discography== ===As leader=== * Moonshadows (1976) * Yesterday's Dreams (1976) * Spellbound (1977) ===As sideman=== With Hermeto Pascoal * Slave Mass (1977) With Abraxas Pool * Abraxas Pool (1997) ;With Chet Baker *You Can't Go Home Again (1977) With Dee Dee Bridgewater *Just Family (1977) With George Cables *Shared Secrets (MuseFX, 2001) With Phil Collins * Face Value (1981) With Steve Hackett * Genesis Revisited (1996) With Eddie Henderson * Sunburst (1975) With Flora Purim * Open Your Eyes You Can Fly (1976) With Santana * Beyond Appearances (1985) * Freedom (1987) * Spirits Dancing in the Flesh (1990) With Weather Report * Mysterious Traveller (1974) * Tale Spinnin' (1975) * Black Market (1976) With Bob Weir * Bobby and the Midnites (1981) * Where the Beat Meets the Street (1984) ==References== == External links == * Category:1951 births Category:American jazz bass guitarists Category:American session musicians Category:Chapman Stick players Category:Epic Records artists Category:Living people Category:Weather Report members Category:20th-century American bass guitarists Category:21st-century American bass guitarists Category:Guitarists from Philadelphia Category:American male bass guitarists Category:The Other Ones members Category:Bobby and the Midnites members Category:Jazz musicians from Pennsylvania Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:21st- century American male musicians Category:American male jazz musicians Category:Jazz Is Dead members Category:Catalyst (band) members ","title":"Alphonso Johnson"},{"id":"1434513","text":"Subaru of America, Inc.

The company markets and distributes Subaru vehicles, parts and accessories through a network of more than 600 dealers throughout the United States. In 1967, Malcolm Bricklin approached Subaru with the idea of bringing the tiny Subaru 360 to the United States. After a great deal of regulatory red tape and negotiation, Bricklin made a deal with Subaru. Bricklin formed Subaru of America, Inc. to sell Subaru franchises and later brought in Harvey Lamm as the COO. Subaru of America was established in 1968 in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. The headquarters later moved to Pennsauken, New Jersey and then Cherry Hill, New Jersey. In 1986, it was fully acquired by Fuji Heavy Industries (now named Subaru Corporation). In 1989, Subaru and then-partner Isuzu opened a joint factory in Lafayette, Indiana, called Subaru-Isuzu Automotive, Inc., or SIA, which initially manufactured the Subaru Legacy and Isuzu Rodeo. In 2001, Isuzu sold its stake in the plant to FHI for $1 due to flagging sales and it was renamed Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc. SIA has been designated a backyard wildlife Habitat by the National Wildlife Federation, and has achieved a zero-landfill production designation.

In his lengthy political career, he served as the 71st Governor of Vermont, a United States Representative, and a U.S. Senator. A Republican, Stafford was generally considered a liberal, or \\"Rockefeller\\" Republican. Stafford is best remembered for his staunch environmentalism, his work on higher education, and his support, as an elder statesman, for the 2000 Vermont law legalizing civil unions for gay couples. ==Early life== Stafford was born in Rutland, Vermont to Bert Linus Stafford and Mabel R. (Stratton) Stafford. Bert Stafford was a 1901 graduate of Middlebury College who practiced law in Rutland, and was President of the Rutland County National Bank. He served as Rutland County's State's Attorney, and was mayor from 1915 to 1917, President of the Vermont Bar Association in 1930, and Chairman of the Vermont Board of Education. Stafford graduated from Middlebury College in 1935. While there, he joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity. He briefly attended the University of Michigan Law School before earning his LL.B. from the Boston University School of Law in 1938. ==Start of career== Upon completing law school, Stafford was admitted to the bar and practiced law with the Rutland firm of Stafford, Abatiell, and Stafford. He became active in politics as a Republican and served as Rutland's grand juror (prosecutor in the municipal court) from 1938 to 1942. ==World War II and Navy Reserve service== In 1942, Stafford joined the United States Navy Reserve for World War II and was commissioned as an ensign. Assigned to the Intelligence branch, he completed his initial training at Dartmouth College and at Fort Dix, New Jersey. He then carried out intelligence officer postings at the Navy Department in Washington, D.C. and at Navy bases on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Stafford later requested sea duty and served as senior watch officer aboard USS West Point, the Navy's largest troop transport ship. During his service on the West Point, the ship made numerous voyages across the Atlantic to Europe and Africa. Stafford advanced to lieutenant commander during the war, and at its end in 1945 he was the ship's chief transportation officer. He returned to Rutland in February 1946 while continuing to serve in the Navy Reserve. In October 1951, Stafford returned to active duty during the Korean War era. He was assigned as gunnery officer aboard USS Mission Bay, a Reserve training ship berthed in Bayonne, New Jersey, and served until February 1953. He remained in the Navy Reserve after his second deployment and retired at the rank of captain in March 1971. ==Continued career== Stafford served as Rutland County's State's Attorney from 1947 to 1951 and practiced law in a new firm, Stafford and LaBrake. Following his Korean War-era deployment, he entered Vermont statewide politics, serving as deputy attorney general for the state from 1953 to 1955, and attorney general from 1955 to 1957. In 1956, he was elected lieutenant governor, and in 1958 was elected governor. Stafford's ascent to the lieutenant governorship and governorship was unusual in that he did not follow the path of most Vermont Republicans. From the founding of the party in the 1850s, Republicans in Vermont had made use of the Mountain Rule, which called for candidates for governor and lieutenant governor to alternate between the east and west sides of the Green Mountains, and for governors to serve only two years in office. U.S. Senators were also allocated according to the Mountain Rule, with one from the east and one from the west. Under this system, candidates for governor and lieutenant governor were chosen by the party years in advance, and served in leadership roles in the Vermont General Assembly, including Speaker of the Vermont House of Representatives and President of the Vermont Senate. Stafford is one of Vermont's few governors who did not serve in the legislature. By the late 1950s, the Democratic Party was becoming increasingly competitive in Vermont, and in the 1958 election, Stafford won the governorship over Bernard J. Leddy with only 50.3% of the vote. Official Vermont State House portrait In 1960, Stafford was the Republican nominee for Vermont's lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, supported by all factions of his party because he was regarded as the strongest challenger to Democrat William H. Meyer, who had broken the Republican Party's 100 year hold on statewide offices by winning election to Congress in 1958. Stafford won, and was subsequently reelected four times, serving in the House from January 3, 1961 to September 16, 1971. In September 1971, he resigned his seat in the House to accept appointment to the Senate, temporarily filling the vacancy caused by the death of Winston L. Prouty. Stafford won the January 1972 special election to serve out the rest of Prouty's term and won reelection twice including the 1976 election against outgoing Governor Thomas P. Salmon. He served for slightly over 17 years, until his retirement in 1989. He chaired the Committee on Environment and Public Works from 1981 to 1987. While in Congress, he helped pass a law, now known as the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, or Stafford Act, to coordinate federal natural disaster assistance. Stafford's support of weapons sales to Nicaraguan contras led to the Winooski 44 protest. As he neared retirement from the Senate, New York Times writer Philip Shabecoff wrote in a profile of Stafford that his tendency to keep his own counsel meant he \\"may give the worst interview of any public official in the capital.\\" Stafford commented on his own reputation for maintaining a low profile by saying \\"I talked more when I was younger.\\" ==Death and burial== Stafford died in his hometown of Rutland on December 23, 2006. He was buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Rutland. His wife Helen Stafford died February 27, 2011, at the age of 93. ==Legacy== In 1988, Congress renamed the Federal Guaranteed Student Loan program the Robert T. Stafford Student Loan program, in honor of his work on higher education. In 2007, Congress renamed the White Rocks National Recreation Area in the State of Vermont as the \\"Robert T.

The members of the group were originally hip-hop DJs, who were among the pioneers of the turntablism movement in the 1990s; turntablists create musical pieces by mixing samples from records, and by using multiple turntables as instruments. The group started in 1989 as Shadow of the Prophet, with DJ Qbert, Mix Master Mike, and DJ Apollo, who left the group in 1993. The group later added DJ Disk, Shortkut, DJ Flare, Yogafrog, D-Styles, and A-Trak to their lineup. They released numerous mix projects and albums and were featured in documentaries such as Battle Sounds and Scratch. The Invisibl Skratch Piklz performed their last show on July 1, 2000 at the Skratchcon 2000 conference in San Francisco, California. They were asked by the Disco Mix Club (DMC), an international DJ association, to stop competing since they were discouraging other DJs from entering. The Piklz produced most of their work around 1995‚Äì2000. During that period, they also gave numerous performances and seminars around the world, helped in the design of various DJ products for Vestax and Ortofon, and developed the \\"break record\\", a tool used by most present-day turntablists. One of their most notable performances was an International Turntablist Federation (ITF) battle between themselves and the X-Men (now the X-Ecutioners) of New York.

In contemporary literature, kama refers usually to sexual desire.James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Volume 1, Rosen Publishing, New York, , pp 340 However, the term also refers to any sensory enjoyment, emotional attraction and aesthetic pleasure such as from arts, dance, music, painting, sculpture and nature.See: * Kate Morris (2011), The Illustrated Dictionary of History, , pp 124; * Robert E. Van Voorst, RELG: World, Wadsworth, , pp 78 The concept kama is found in some of the earliest known verses in the Vedas. For example, Book 10 of the Rig Veda describes the creation of the universe from nothing by the great heat. There in hymn 129, it states: The Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, one of the oldest Upanishads of Hinduism, uses the term kama, also in a broader sense, to refer to any desire: Ancient Indian literature such as the Epics, which followed the Upanishads, develop and explain the concept of kama together with Artha and Dharma. The Mahabharata, for example, provides one of the expansive definitions of kama. The Epic claims kama to be any agreeable and desirable experience (pleasure) generated by the interaction of one or more of the five senses with anything congenial to that sense and while the mind is concurrently in harmony with the other goals of human life (dharma, artha and moksha).R. Prasad (2008), History of Science, Philosophy and Culture in Indian Civilization, Volume 12, Part 1, , Chapter 10, particularly pp 252-255 Kama often implies the short form of the word kamana (desire, appetition or appetite). Kama, however, is more than kamana. Kama is an experience that includes the discovery of an object, learning about the object, emotional connection, the process of enjoyment and the resulting feeling of well-being before, during, and after the experience.R. Prasad (2008), History of Science, Philosophy and Culture in Indian Civilization, Volume 12, Part 1, , pp 249-270 Vatsyayana, the author of the Kamasutra, describes kama as happiness that is a manasa vyapara (phenomenon of the mind). Just like the Mahabharata, Vatsyayana's Kamasutra defines kama as pleasure an individual experiences from the world, with one or more senses: hearing, seeing, tasting, smelling, and feeling‚Äîin harmony with one's mind and soul. Experiencing harmonious music is kama, as is being inspired by natural beauty, the aesthetic appreciation of a work of art, and admiring with joy something created by another human being. Kama Sutra, in its discourse on kama, describes many forms of art, dance, and music, along with sex, as the means to pleasure and enjoyment. Pleasure enhances one's appreciation of incense, candles, music, scented oil, yoga stretching and meditation, and the experience of the heart chakra. Negativity, doubt and hesitation blocks the heart chakra, openness is impaired while attached to desires. Kamala in the heart chakra, is considered to be a seat of devotional worship. Opening the heart chakra is awareness of a divine communion and joy for communion with deities and the self (atman). John Lochtefeld explains kama as desire, noting that it often refers to sexual desire in contemporary literature, but in ancient Indian literature kƒÅma includes any kind of attraction and pleasure such as those deriving from the arts. Karl Potter describesKarl H. Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, , pp. 1-29 kama as an attitude and capacity. A little girl who hugs her teddy bear with a smile is experiencing kama, as are two lovers in embrace. During these experiences, the person connects and identifies the beloved as part of oneself and feels more complete, fulfilled, and whole by experiencing that connection and nearness. This, in the Indian perspective, is kƒÅma. Hindery notes the inconsistent and diverse expositions of kama in various ancient texts of India. Some texts, such as the Epic Ramayana, paint kama through the desire of Rama for Sita -- a desire that transcends the physical and marital into a love that is spiritual, and something that gives Rama his meaning of life, his reason to live.Roderick Hindery, \\"Hindu Ethics in the Ramayana\\", The Journal of Religious Ethics, Vol. 4, No. 2 (Fall, 1976), pp. 299 Sita and Rama both frequently express their unwillingness and inability to live without the other.See verses at 2.30, 4.1, 6.1, 6.83 for example; Abridged Verse 4.1: \\"Sita invades my entire being and my love is entirely centered on her; Without that lady of lovely eyelashes, beautiful looks, and gentle speech, I cannot survive, O Saumitri.\\"; for peer reviewed source, see Hindery, The Journal of Religious Ethics, Vol. 4, No. 2 (Fall, 1976), pp 299-300 This romantic and spiritual view of kama in the Ramayana by Valmiki is quite different, claim Hindery and others,Benjamin Khan (1965), The concept of Dharma in Valmiki Ramayana, Delhi, than the normative and dry description of kama in the law codes of smriti by Manu for example. Gavin Flood explainsGavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in Julius Lipner (Editor), The Fruits of Our Desiring, , pp 11-13 kama as \\"love\\" without violating dharma (moral responsibility), artha (material prosperity) and one's journey towards moksha (spiritual liberation). ==In Hinduism== In Hinduism, kama is regarded as one of the four proper and necessary goals of human life (purusharthas), the others being Dharma (virtuous, proper, moral life), Artha (material prosperity, income security, means of life) and Moksha (liberation, release, self-actualization). ===Relative precedence between Kama, Artha, and Dharma=== Ancient Indian literature emphasizes that dharma precedes and is essential. If dharma is ignored, artha and kama lead to social chaos.Gavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in Julius Lipner (Editor) - The Fruits of Our Desiring, , pp 16-21 Vatsyayana in Kama Sutra recognizes relative value of three goals as follows: artha precedes kama, while dharma precedes both kama and artha. Vatsyayana, in Chapter 2 of Kama Sutra, presents a series of philosophical objections argued against kama and then offers his answers to refute those objections. For example, one objection to kama (pleasure, enjoyment), acknowledges Vatsyayana, is this concern that kƒÅma is an obstacle to moral and ethical life, to religious pursuits, to hard work, and to productive pursuit of prosperity and wealth. The pursuit of pleasure, claim objectors, encourages individuals to commit unrighteous deeds, bring distress, carelessness, levity and suffering later in life.The Hindu Kama Shastra Society (1925), The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana, University of Toronto Archives, pp. 9-10 These objections were then answered by Vatsyayana, with the declaration that kama is as necessary to human beings as food, and kama is holistic with dharma and artha. ===Kama is necessary for existence=== Just like good food is necessary for the well being of the body, good pleasure is necessary for the healthy existence of a human being, suggests Vatsyayana.The Hindu Kama Shastra Society (1925), The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana, University of Toronto Archives, Chapter 2, pp 8-11; pp 172 A life devoid of pleasure and enjoyment‚Äîsexual, artistic, of nature‚Äîis hollow and empty. Just like no one should stop farming crops even though everyone knows herds of deer exist and will try to eat the crop as it grows up, in the same way claims Vatsyayana, one should not stop one's pursuit of kama because dangers exist. Kama should be followed with thought, care, caution and enthusiasm, just like farming or any other life pursuit. Vatsyayana's book the Kama Sutra, in parts of the world, is presumed or depicted as a synonym for creative sexual positions; in reality, only 20% of Kama Sutra is about sexual positions. The majority of the book, notes Jacob Levy,Jacob Levy (2010), Kama sense marketing, iUniverse, , see Introduction is about the philosophy and theory of love, what triggers desire, what sustains it, how and when it is good or bad. Kama Sutra presents kama as an essential and joyful aspect of human existence.Alain Dani√©lou, The Complete Kama Sutra: The First Unabridged Modern Translation of the Classic Indian Text, ===Kama is holistic=== Vatsyayana claims kama is never in conflict with dharma or artha, rather all three coexist and kama results from the other two. In Hindu philosophy, pleasure in general, and sexual pleasure in particular, is neither shameful nor dirty. It is necessary for human life, essential for well being of every individual, and wholesome when pursued with due consideration of dharma and artha. Unlike the precepts of some religions, kama is celebrated in Hinduism, as a value in its own right.Bullough and Bullough (1994), Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia, Routledge, , pp 516 Together with artha and dharma, it is an aspect of a holistic life.Gary Kraftsow, Yoga for Transformation - ancient teachings and practices for healing body, mind and heart, Penguin, , pp 11-15 All three purusharthas‚ÄîDharma, Artha and Kama‚Äîare equally and simultaneously important.C. Ramanathan, Ethics in the Ramayana, in History of Science, Philosophy and Culture in Indian Civilization (Editor: R. Prasad), Volume 12, Part 1, , pp 84-85 ===Kama and stage of life=== SomeP.V. Kane (1941), History of Dharmashastra, Volume 2, Part 1, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pp. 8-9 ancient Indian literature observe that the relative precedence of artha, kama and dharma are naturally different for different people and different age groups. In a baby or child, education and kƒÅma (artistic desires) take precedence; in youth kƒÅma and artha take precedence; while in old age dharma takes precedence. ===Kama as deity=== Kama is personified as deity Kamadeva and his consort Rati. Deity Kama is comparable to the Greek deity Eros‚Äîthey both trigger human sexual attraction and sensual desire. Kama rides a parrot, and the deity is armed with bow and arrows to pierce hearts. The bow is made of sugarcane stalk, the bowstring is a line of bees, and the arrows are tipped with five flowers representing five emotions-driven love states.Coulter and Turner, Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities, Francis & Taylor, , pp 258-259 The five flowers on Kama arrows are lotus flower (infatuation), ashoka flower (intoxication with thoughts about the other person), mango flower (exhaustion and emptiness in absence of the other), jasmine flower (pining for the other) and blue lotus flower (paralysis with confusion and feelings). Kama is also known as Ananga (literally \\"one without body\\") because desire strikes formlessly, through feelings in unseen ways. The other names for deity Kama include Madan (he who intoxicates with love), Manmatha (he who agitates the mind), Pradyumna (he who conquers all) and Kushumesu (he whose arrows are flowers).William Joseph Wilkins (193), Hindu mythology, Vedic and Puranic, Thacker & Spink, Indiana University Archives, pp 268 ==In Buddhism== In Buddhism's Pali Canon, the Gautama Buddha renounced (Pali: nekkhamma) sensuality (kama) in route to his Awakening.See, for instance, Dvedhavitakka Sutta (MN 19) (Thanissaro, 1997a). Some Buddhist lay practitioners recite daily the Five Precepts, a commitment to abstain from \\"sexual misconduct\\" (kƒÅmesu micchacara ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏™‡∏∏ ‡∏°‡∏¥‡∏à‡∏∫‡∏â‡∏≤‡∏à‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏≤).See, for instance, Khantipalo (1995). Typical of Pali Canon discourses, the Dhammika Sutta (Sn 2.14) includes a more explicit correlate to this precept when the Buddha enjoins a follower to \\"observe celibacy or at least do not have sex with another's wife.\\" ==Theosophy: kama, kamarupa and kamaloka== In the Theosophy of Blavatsky, Kama is the fourth principle of the septenary, associated with emotions and desires, attachment to existence, volition, and lust.Farthing 1978 p.210. Kamaloka is a semi-material plane, subjective and invisible to humans, where disembodied \\"personalities\\", the astral forms, called Kama-rupa remain until they fade out from it by the complete exhaustion of the effects of the mental impulses that created these eidolons of human and animal passions and desires. It is associated with Hades of ancient Greeks and the Amenti of the Egyptians, the land of Silent Shadows; a division of the first group of the Trailokya. ==See also== *Arishadvargas, six enemies *Alcmaeon (mythology) *Buddhist cosmology of the Theravada school *Cupid *Kaam, a word with a similar meaning ==References== ===Sources=== * Ireland, John D.

He is a former member of the Society of Professional Journalists. He has been the keynote speaker at several of The Skeptics Society's annual conventions. Cassingham is the author of the weekly syndicated news column This is True (founded 1994), which Cassingham made available by e-mail subscription to become one of the first for-profit e-mailed newsletters on the Internet. (In January 1997, an expanded paid version became one of the first paid e-mailed newsletters on the Internet.) \\"This is True\\" features several actual news items each week of unbelievable- yet-true character, with each story capped by a pithy one-liner which is \\"humorous, ironic or opinionated.\\" Cassingham is the creator of the \\"Get Out of Hell Free\\" card (his response to a This is True reader who complained that a story about Feng Shui was \\"anti-Christian\\" and told him he was going to hell), the Internet Spam Primer, and several other web sites. Cassingham also started the \\"HeroicStories\\" e-mail newsletter (founded 1999), which tells the stories of remarkable acts of kindness and courage. Management of \\"HeroicStories\\" has since been turned over to others. Cassingham is a volunteer emergency medical First Responder for the area around his home in rural Western Colorado. He has been married to Kathryn Anne (\\"Kit\\") Riley since 2001. == Stella Awards == Cassingham is also the Founder of the \\"True Stella Awards\\", a web site dedicated to informing the public about allegedly frivolous legal cases. The site was expanded into a 2005 book of the same name, published by Dutton, an imprint of the Penguin Group. The awards were given between 2002 and 2007 to people who filed \\"outrageous and frivolous lawsuits\\". There are also a number of false Stella Awards circulating on the Internet. The awards were named after Stella Liebeck who, in 1992, received third degree burns to her thighs and genitals after ordering a cup of McDonald's coffee at a drive thru, putting it in between her knees while sitting in the passenger seat of her grandson's stationary car, and attempted to remove the lid in order to add cream and sugar. The coffee was at , a temperature which the restaurant was aware had caused burns to more than 700 people;Ralph Nader & Wesley J. Smith, No Contest: Corporate Lawyers and the Perversion of Justice in America (1996) , 268 after McDonald's refused to pay for her skin grafts, and rejected several attempts at mediation and settlement,Andrea Gerlin, Wall Street Journal, \\"A Matter of Degree: How a Jury Decided that a Coffee Spill is Worth $2.9 Million\\", September 1, 1994, p. A1, available from txstate.edu] Liebeck sued, winning the lawsuit and being awarded $640,000. (The amount originally awarded by the jury was over $2.9 million but it was reduced by the judge. The final amount that she got remains unknown, since it resulted from a confidential post-trial settlement between Liebeck and McDonald's.) In July 2012, Cassingham sent a message to the True Stella Awards mailing list, announcing that after several abortive attempts to restart the list he came to the conclusion that he had said everything about the subject of frivolous lawsuits that he had intended to say, and so was shutting down the Stella Awards. ==Published work == * ==References== ==External links== * Cassingham's This is True website * Cassingham's \\"This is True\\" YouTube Channel * \\"True Stella Awards\\" website * \\"Get Out of Hell Free\\" website * \\"Honorary Unsubscribe\\" website * \\"Bonzer Web Sites of the Week\\" website * \\"Cranky Customer\\" website * the \\"Spam Primer\\" website * Cassingham's Dvorak keyboard primer * JumboJoke.com * Groxx ‚Äì a site for user submitted This is True-style stories * the \\"HeroicStories\\" website * Cassingham.com ‚Äì Randy Cassingham's personal website * Biography of Randy Cassingham on Cassingham.com * Randy Cassingham's blog * \\"How I Invented For Profit Email Publishing\\" * \\"Genesis: This Just In\\" (a short history of This is True) * Yahoo has stopped delivering This Is True because too many Yahoo readers have mistakenly or carelessly flagged it as spam.

It may be caused by vitamin A deficiency, which is sometimes used to describe that condition, although there may be other causes. Xerophthalmia caused by a severe vitamin A deficiency is described by pathologic dryness of the conjunctiva and cornea. The conjunctiva becomes dry, thick and wrinkled. If untreated, it can lead to corneal ulceration and ultimately to blindness as a result of corneal damage. Xerophthalmia usually implies a destructive dryness of the conjunctival epithelium due to dietary vitamin A deficiency‚Äîa rare condition in developed countries, but still causing much damage in developing countries. Other forms of dry eye are associated with aging, poor lid closure, scarring from a previous injury, or autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sj√∂gren's syndrome, and these can all cause chronic conjunctivitis. Radioiodine therapy can also induce xerophthalmia, often transiently, although in some patients late onset or persistent xerophthalmia has been observed. The damage to the cornea in vitamin A associated xerophthalmia is quite different from damage to the retina at the back of the globe, a type of damage which can also be due to lack of vitamin A, but which is caused by lack of other forms of vitamin A which work in the visual system. Xerophthalmia from hypovitaminosis A is specifically due to lack of the hormone-like vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid, since (along with certain growth-stunting effects) the condition can be reversed in vitamin A deficient rats by retinoic acid supplementation (however the retinal damage continues). Since retinoic acid cannot be reduced to retinal or retinol, these effects on the cornea must be specific to retinoic acid. This is in keeping with retinoic acid's known requirement for good health in epithelial cells, such as those in the cornea. ==Cause== The condition is not congenital and develops over the course of a few months as the lacrimal glands fail to produce tears. Other conditions involved in the progression already stated include the appearance of Bitot's spots, which are clumps of keratin debris that build up inside the conjunctiva and night blindness, which precedes corneal ulceration and total blindness. ==Classification== World Health Organization classified xerophthalmia into following stages: * XN-Night blindness * X1A-Conjunctival xerosis * X1B-Bitot spots * X2-Corneal xerosis * X3A-Corneal ulceration/keratomalacia, involving less than one-third of the cornea * X3B-Corneal ulceration/keratomalacia, involving more than one-third of the cornea * XS-Corneal scar due to xerophthalmia * XF-Xerophthalmic fundus ==Prevention== Prophylaxis consists of periodic administration of Vitamin A supplements. WHO recommended schedule, which is universally recommended is as follows: * Infants 6‚Äì12 months old and any older children weighing less than 8 kg ‚Äì 100,000 IU orally every 3‚Äì6 months * Children over 1 year and under 6 years of age ‚Äì 200,000 IU orally every 6 months * Infants less than 6 months old, who are not being breastfed ‚Äì 50,000 IU orally should be given before they attain the age of 6 months == Treatment == Treatment can occur in two ways: treating symptoms and treating the deficiency. Treatment of symptoms usually includes the use of artificial tears in the form of eye drops, increasing the humidity of the environment with humidifiers, and wearing wraparound glasses when outdoors. Treatment of the deficiency can be accomplished with a Vitamin A or multivitamin supplement or by eating foods rich in Vitamin A. Treatment with supplements and/or diet can be successful until the disease progresses as far as corneal ulceration, at which point only an extreme surgery can offer a chance of returning sight. == Epidemiology == Xerophthalmia usually affects children under nine years old and \\"accounts for 20,000‚Äì100,000 new cases of childhood blindness each year in the developing countries.\\" The disease is largely found in developing countries like many of those in Africa and Southern Asia. ==See also== * Keratoconjunctivitis * Keratoconjunctivitis sicca * Keratomalacia, also caused by vitamin A deficiency. ==References== == Further reading == *Medicine.Net. \\"Definition of Xerophthalmia.\\" 26 May 2003. *Jellife DB. \\"Xerophthalmia: A World-wide Drive for Prevention.\\" Journal of Tropical Pediatrics 1980; 26: ii- iii. 4 November 2009. == External links == Category:Disorders of eyelid, lacrimal system and orbit Category:Vitamin deficiencies ","title":"Xerophthalmia"},{"id":"1434578","text":"Alexander or Alex Henderson may refer to: * Alexander Henderson (theologian) (c. 1583‚Äì1646), Scottish theologian * Alexander Henderson (priest) (1807‚Äì1888), Scottish Episcopalian priest, Dean of Glasgow and Galloway * Alexander Henderson (Canadian politician) (1860‚Äì1940), historical member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, and Commissioner of Yukon 1907‚Äì1911 * Alexander Henderson (American politician) (1738‚Äì1815), Scottish merchant and politician in Virginia * Alexander D.

It was one of the successor states of the Imperial County of Reuss. The Counts Reuss, with their respective capitals and Residenzen at Gera, Schleiz, Lobenstein, K√∂stritz and Ebersdorf were all elevated to the title of prince (F√ºrst) in 1806, and their successor branch heads shared that title, while their cadets were also each titled prince (Prinz). Thus all males of the family were properly \\"Prince Heinrich (Roman numeral) Reuss, J.L.\\", without use of a nobiliary particle, although for convenience their branch names remained in colloquial use (for example, \\"Prince Heinrich I Reuss of K√∂stritz\\"). ==Territory== The territories of four separate branches of the Junior Line amalgamated between 1824 and 1848, at which time the seniormost line of Gera retained sovereignty over the surviving cadet branches, which retained succession rights to the princely throne. In 1905, the principality of Reuss Junior Line had an area of and a population of 145,000, with Gera as its capital. In the aftermath of World War I, the territory of the Junior Line merged with that of the Elder Line in 1919 as the People's State of Reuss, which became part of the new state of Thuringia on 1 May 1920. ==The princely house== The House of Reuss practises a unique system of naming and numbering the male members of the family, every one of whom for centuries has borne the name \\"Heinrich\\", followed by a Roman numeral. While most royal and noble houses assign a regnal number only to the ruling head of the house, and that in the sequential order of their reigns, the Reuss Junior Line (\\"Reuss, J.L.\\") used a numbering sequence for all male family members which began afresh with the first son born in each century. The male children within a single nuclear family need not bear sequential numbers, as all members of the larger family share the common numbering system. For example, the sons of Prince Heinrich LXVII Reuss of Schleiz, in order of their births, were named Heinrich V, Heinrich VIII, Heinrich XI, Heinrich XIV, and Heinrich XVI, with their male-line kinsmen holding the numerals in between according to the order of their births. In consequence of this naming system, certain heads of the Reuss Junior Line have had the highest numbers attached to their name of any European ruling families. The designation of \\"Junior Line\\" was dropped in 1930; the Elder Line (\\"Reuss, A.L.\\") had become extinct as its last male member, Heinrich XXIV, renounced his rights as sovereign in 1918 and died unmarried in 1927. A notable member of this family, Augusta Reuss-Ebersdorf (1757‚Äì1831), became the maternal grandmother of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. ==Counts of Plauen== One of the younger sub-lines of the branch which ruled the Reuss, J.L. until 1918, includes the \\"Counts of Plauen\\" from the late 19th century. When Prince Heinrich XXVI Reuss (1857-1913) married Countess Viktoria von F√ºrstenstein (1863-1949) in 1885, under the strict marriage rules then enforced by the Reuss dynasty, although he was but a younger son of a minor ruling family, their children were not allowed to bear the dynasty's princely title. They were, instead, designated \\"Counts of Plauen\\", although they remained in the line of succession to the two thrones of Reuss The F√ºrstensteins lacked Uradel status: Viktoria's paternal grandfather, Pierre Alexandre LeCamus 1774-1824, son of a French notary living in Martinique, rose to become foreign minister in Jerome Bonaparte's Kingdom of Westphalia, was ennobled there in 1807 and made a count of the French Empire in 1817). When the German Empire collapsed at the end of World War I, the reigning Prince Reuss lost his crown along with all the other monarchs whose realms were within Germany. In 1927, Henrich XXVI's son, known as Count Heinrich Harry of Plauen (1890-1951), was adopted by his childless uncle, Prince Heinrich XXX (1864-1939), and the now-deposed dynasty agreed to accept him as \\"Prince Heinrich Harry Reu√ü\\", along with those of his male-line descendants born of unions complying with the family's 1902 rules that permitted marriages to countesses (Heinrich Harry's wife, Huberta von Tiele- Winckler was only a baroness in her own right, but belonged to a family of comital rank in Prussia). Their son Heinrich Enzio was thus accepted by the House of Reuss as a prince, but his own marriage to Baron Gustaf Peyron's daughter in 1949 occurred before the Reuss family conference of 1957 which lowered the marital standard again, allowing dynastic inter-marriage with baronial families. Strictly, therefore, since 1996 the House of Reuss recognized Prince Heinrich Ruzzo Reuss by that title, but without official membership in the dynasty or entitlement to the traditional style of Serene Highness, while in German law the title is allowed since 1919 only as part of the surname, thus \\"Heinrich Ruzzo Prinz Reuss\\". ===Princes of Reuss-Gera (1806‚Äì1918)=== * Heinrich I, Lord of Reuss-Schleiz 1666-1673, Count of Reuss- Schleiz 1673-1692 (1639-1692) ** Heinrich XI, Count of Reuss-Schleiz 1692-1726 (1669-1726) *** Heinrich I, Count of Reuss-Schleiz 1726-1744 (1695-1744) *** Heinrich XII, Count of Reuss-Schleiz 1744-1784 (1716-1784) **** Heinrich XLII, Count of Reuss-Schleiz from 1784, 1st Prince 1806-1818 (1752-1818) ***** Heinrich LXII, 2nd Prince 1818-1854 (1785-1854) ***** Heinrich LXVII, 3rd Prince 1854-1867 (1789-1867) ****** Heinrich XIV, 4th Prince 1867-1913 (1832-1913) ******* Heinrich XXVII, 5th Prince 1913-1918 (1858-1928) ** Heinrich XXIV, Count of Reuss-Schleiz-K√∂stritz 1692-1748 (1681-1748) (de), all surviving dynasts descend from him Monarchy abolished in 1918. ===Heads of the House of Reuss=== * Heinrich XXVII, 1918-1928 (1858-1928), became \\"Prince Reuss\\" 1927 on death of last Prince of the Elder Line ** Heinrich XLV, Prince Reuss 1928-1945/1962 (1895-1945/1962), missing 1945, declared dead 1962, headship passed to 7th cousin once removed (see below) * Heinrich XXIV, Count of Reuss-K√∂stritz 1692-1748 (1681-1748), from above ** Heinrich IX, Count of Reuss-K√∂stritz middle line 1748-1780 (1711-1780), second surviving son *** Prince Heinrich XLIV of Reuss-K√∂stritz (1753-1832) **** Prince Heinrich LXIII of Reuss-K√∂stritz (1786-1841) ***** Heinrich IV, 4th Prince Reuss zu Schleiz- K√∂stritz 1878-1894 (1821-1894) ****** Heinrich XXIV, 5th Prince Reuss zu Schleiz-K√∂stritz 1894-1910 (1855-1910) ******* Heinrich XXXIX, 6th Prince Reuss zu Schleiz-K√∂stritz 1910-1945 (1891-1946), renounced title ******** Heinrich IV, 7th Prince Reuss zu Schleiz-K√∂stritz 1945-1962, Prince Reuss 1962‚Äì2012 (1919-2012) ********* Heinrich XIV, Prince Reuss 2012‚Äìpresent (born 1955) ********** (1) Heinrich XXIX, Hereditary Prince Reuss (born 1997) ********** (2) Prince Heinrich V Reuss (born 2012) ******** Prince Heinrich VII Reuss (1927-2002) ********* (3) Prince Heinrich XIX Reuss (born 1974) ********* (4) Prince Heinrich XXI Reuss (born 1976) ***** Prince Heinrich XII (1829-1866) ****** Prince Heinrich XXVIII (1859-1924, renounced his titles 1908) ******* Prince Heinrich XXXIV (1887-1956) ******** Prince Heinrich I (1910-1982) ********* (5) Prince Heinrich VIII (born 1944) ********** (6) Prince Heinrich XX (born 1975) ********** (7) Prince Heinrich XXIII (born 1979) ********* (8) Prince Heinrich IX (born 1947) ********** (9) Prince Heinrich XXVI (born 1988) ********* (10) Prince Heinrich X (born 1948) ********** (11) Prince Heinrich XXIV (born 1984) ******** Prince Heinrich III (1919-1993) ********* (12) Prince Heinrich XII (born 1950) ********** (13) Prince Heinrich XXI (born 1976) *********** (14) Prince Heinrich III (born ca. 2010) *********** (15) Prince Heinrich IV (born 2011) ********** (16) Prince Heinrich XXV (born 1984) ********* (17) Prince Heinrich XVII (born 1968) ********** (18) Prince Heinrich II (born 2004) **** Prince Heinrich LXXIV (1798-1886), third surviving son, descendants survive as Count of Plauen Line ** Heinrich XXIII, Count of Reuss-Schleiz-K√∂stritz junior line 1748-1787 (1722-1787), third surviving son, dynasts survive in 2015 ==Other notable figures== * Princess Augusta Reuss of K√∂stritz (1822‚Äì1862) * Prince Heinrich XXIV Reuss of K√∂stritz (1855‚Äì1910), composer * Princess Eleonore Reuss of K√∂stritz (1860‚Äì1917), Tsaritsa of Bulgaria * Prince Heinrich XXXII Reuss of K√∂stritz, heir presumptive to Wilhelmina of the Netherlands until 1909 * Princess Magdalena Reuss of K√∂stritz, wife of Prince Hubertus of Prussia ==References== Category:States and territories disestablished in 1918 Category:Reuss Category:States and territories established in 1806 Category:Gera * Younger Category:States of the Confederation of the Rhine Category:States of the German Empire Category:States of the German Confederation Category:Upper Saxon Circle Category:1806 establishments in Europe Category:1918 disestablishments in Germany Category:19th century in Germany by state ","title":"Principality of Reuss-Gera"},{"id":"1434597","text":"Blaafarvev√¶rket in √Ömot Blaafarvev√¶rket, or the Blue Colour Works, was a mining and industrial company located at √Ömot in Modum in Viken county, Norway, which existed from 1776 to 1898. The works mined cobalt ore and manufactured by smelting blue cobalt glass (smalt) and cobalt blue (cobalt aluminate) pigment. It is currently a large open-air industrial museum and an art gallery; it is the largest and best preserved mine museum in Europe, and one of Norway's most visited attractions.\\"Ingen sommer uten Blaafarvev√¶rket,\\" Byavisa Drammen, 21 June 2017 The company was founded by King Christian VII in 1776 and was one of the few companies with lasting significance from the age of mercantilism, played an important role in Norwegian trade with Denmark, the Netherlands and the Far East and had a decisive impact on the Norwegian economy in the period around 1814. In 1822 the company was sold to the Berlin banker Wilhelm Christian Benecke and Benjamin Wegner, and their ownership lasted until 1849, a period regarded as the company's heyday and during which it became the largest industrial company of the country. The company went bankrupt in 1849 in the wake of the revolutions of 1848 and competition from synthetic ultramarine, but a greatly reduced activity continued until 1898. From 1968 Blaafarvev√¶rket has been made available to the public as a museum and art gallery. It is presented to the public like the mining company it was around 1840 during its heyday. ==History== Benjamin Wegner, the director- general from 1822 to 1849, during Blaafarvev√¶rket's heyday ===Royal ownership=== Blaafarvev√¶rket was founded by King Christian VII of Denmark- Norway in 1776. Its early history is closely tied to that of the Royal Porcelain Factory in Copenhagen, as cobalt was essential for decorating porcelain. The establishment of the company represented an enormous investment on the part of the King, equivalent to the tax revenues for all of Denmark- Norway for a whole year. According to historian Ingerid Hagen, Blaafarvev√¶rket was one of the few Dano-Norwegian companies with lasting significance from the mercantilist era, played an important role in Norwegian trade with Denmark, the Netherlands and countries in Asia and had a decisive impact on the Norwegian economy in the period around 1814.Guri Kul√•s, \\"F√∏r oljen var kobolten,\\" Klassekampen, 31 May 2014, pp. 40‚Äì41 ===The Benecke‚ÄìWegner era=== During the Napoleonic Wars the royal company was pledged by the king as security for a loan, and when the state could not redeem the pledge after the Napoleonic Wars, it was taken over by the bankruptcy estate of the Swedish businessman Peter Wilhelm Berg, and sold at a public auction to a group of investors led by the prominent Berlin banker Wilhelm Christian Benecke (since ennobled as Baron Benecke). The purchase, officially in the name of a Christiania-based merchant who acted as a strawman, was orchestrated by Benecke's young associate Benjamin Wegner, who came to Norway to evaluate the company and buy it if he saw fit. After few years Benecke and Wegner formally acquired all the shares, and the company legally operated as Benecke & Wegner. Wegner also took over as director-general (CEO), a position he held from 1822 until 1849. During Benecke and Wegner's ownership, the company saw a large expansion and became the largest company in the country. It employed more than 2,000 workers, and in its peak supplied 80 percent of the world market for cobalt pigments. Wegner also instituted many important social reforms for the workers. ===Reduced activity 1849‚Äì1898=== The economic crisis resulting from the revolutions of 1848, in addition to the competition from the new and cheaper synthetic blue dye, ultramarine, led to the bankruptcy of Blaafarvev√¶rket in 1849. The company was sold to its most important business partner, Goodhall & Reeves of England. However, due to the economic recession, the new owners did not succeed in making the company profitable again, and in 1855 it was sold to a German company, S√§chsischer Blaufarbenwerkverein. The production of pigment at the works ceased in 1857, but mining was kept up until 1898, when the company was dissolved. Blaafarvev√¶rket Museum and Art Gallery ===Museum and art gallery=== In 1978, an independent foundation was established to make Blaafarvev√¶rket available to the public as an industrial museum and art gallery. Blaafarvev√¶rket has since become one of the most important art galleries in Scandinavia, and has over the years exhibited the works of many major Norwegian and foreign artists. In the summer of 2003, the gallery hosted an exhibition of the paintings of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. In 1993, the old cobalt mines opened as a tourist attraction, and the entire area now serves as a large open-air museum. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Economic history of Norway Category:Museums in Viken Category:Art museums and galleries in Norway Category:Mining companies of Norway Category:Cobalt Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1776 Category:1776 establishments in Norway Category:Museums established in 1978 Category:Modum Category:1898 disestablishments in Norway Category:Companies disestablished in 1898 Category:Norwegian companies established in 1978 ","title":"Blaafarvev√¶rket"},{"id":"1434616","text":"A Palm Sunday photo of the blessing of palms, a sacramental in Christianity A sacramental is a material object or action (in Latin sacramentalia) ritually blessed by a priest to signal its association with the Sacraments and so to incite reverence during acts of worship. They are recognised by the Roman and Eastern Catholic churches, the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox churches, the Church of the East, as well as certain Anglican, Independent Catholic and Old Catholic, Lutheran churches, and Methodist churches. Holy water, for example, is a sacramental that believers use to recall their baptism; other common sacramentals include blessed candles (often given to churchgoers on Candlemas), blessed palms (given away at churches on Palm Sunday), blessed ashes (placed on believers' foreheads on Ash Wednesday services), a cross necklace (often taken to be blessed by a pastor before daily use), blessed salt, and holy cards, as well as Christian art, especially a crucifix. Apart from those worn daily, such as a cross necklace or devotional scapular, sacramentals are often kept on home altars in Christian households. As an adjective, sacramental means \\"of or pertaining to sacraments\\". == Biblical basis == The Biblical basis for the use of sacramentals is that Jesus used a form of sacramentals himself; for example, when Christ healed a blind man, he made a mud paste that He put over the eyes of the man, before telling him to wash in the Pool of Siloam. == Denominational usage == === Anglican === The Anglican Rosary sitting atop the Anglican Breviary and the Book of Common Prayer A text of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America includes items such as the Anglican rosary, ashes, and palms among objects counted as sacramentals. === Catholic === The Catholic Church currently defines sacramentals as \\"sacred signs which... signify effects, particularly of a spiritual nature, which are obtained through the intercession of the Church. By them men are disposed to receive the chief effect of the sacraments, and various occasions in life are rendered holy.\\" Sacrosanctum Concilium 60 Sacramentals do not confer the grace of the Holy Spirit in the way that the sacraments do, but by the Church‚Äôs prayer, they prepare one to receive grace and dispose a person to cooperate with it. \\"For well-disposed members of the faithful, the liturgy of the sacraments and sacramentals sanctifies almost every event of their lives with the divine grace which flows from the Paschal mystery of the Passion, Death, and Resurrection of Christ. From this source all sacraments and sacramentals draw their power.\\"Catechism of the Catholic Church ¬ß 1670 The Catechism of the Catholic Church lists three types of sacramentals: blessings,Catechism of the Catholic Church ¬ß 1671 consecrations/dedications, and exorcisms. Rosary beads, scapulars, medals and religious images are more accurately termed devotional articles; non- liturgical prayers such as the rosary, the stations of the cross, litanies, and novenas are called popular devotions or \\"expressions of popular piety\\". The Latin Church allows the reception of certain sacramentals, such as blessings, by non-Catholics unless there is a prohibition to the contrary.Code of Canon Law 1170 === Pentecostal === A blessed prayer cloth and holy anointing oil distributed by the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, a Pentecostal apostolate Pentecostal theologian Mark Pearson states that the Bible speaks of sacramentals, sometimes referred to as points of contact, such as blessed prayer cloths () and holy oil ().

It includes the time, date, duration and destination number of each call, the type of network a consumer subscribes to, and any other information that appears on the consumer's telephone bill. Telemarketers or customer service agents working on behalf of telephone companies must go through an additional customer authentication layer (typically a PIN, or last four of the stored payment method) and ask for the customer's consent prior to accessing the billing information or before using or sharing that information for any purpose, including but not limited to, offering an up-sell or any change of services. Usually, this is done at the beginning of a call from the telemarketer to the telephone subscriber. == Description == The U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 granted the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) authority to regulate how customer proprietary network information (CPNI) can be used and to enforce related consumer information privacy provisions. The rules in the 2007 FCC CPNI Order further restrict CPNI use and created new notification and reporting requirements. The rules in the 2007 CPNI Order include: * Limits the information which carriers may provide to third-party marketing firms without first securing the affirmative consent of their customers * Defines when and how customer service representatives may share call details * Creates new notification and reporting obligations for carriers (including identity verification procedures) * Verification process must MATCH what is shown with the company placing the call. Note that as long as an affiliate is \\"communications\\" related, the FCC has ruled that CPNI is under an opt-out approach (can be shared without your explicit permission). A phone company is permitted to sell all information on you, such as numbers you call, when you called them, where you were when you called them, or any other personally identifying information. CPNI would normally require a warrant for law enforcement agencies, but it can be freely sold to \\"communications\\" related companies. One can verify this by checking rule 64.2007(b)(1) and footnote 137 in the 2007 CPNI order. One can call up a phone company and opt out by requesting that they do not share CPNI information. In the case of Verizon Wireless, for example, the company states that on the one hand, \\"Your privacy is an important priority at Verizon Wireless\\", and on the other hand, states that Verizon shares CPNI \\"among our affiliates and parent companies (including Vodafone) and their subsidiaries unless you advise us not to\\". and states that it shares \\"URLs (such as search terms) of websites you visit when you use our wireless service, the location of your device (\\"location information\\"), and your use of applications and features\\" as well as other \\"information about your use of Verizon products and services (such as data and calling features, device type, and amount of use), as well as demographic and interest categories (such as gender, age range, sports fan, frequent diner, or pet owner)\\" with other non-affiliated companies, and does allow customers to request that such sharing not be done via an online form, and it is unclear whether Verizon considers some or all such \\"online\\" requests to be about CPNI or as legally binding as \\"call-based\\" requests about CPNI.https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-16-39A1.pdf?platform=hootsuite The 2007 CPNI Order does not revise all CPNI rules. For example, the rule revisions adopted in the Order do not limit a carrier's ability to use CPNI to perform billing and collections functions, restrict CPNI use to effect maintenance and repair activity, or impact responses to lawful subpoenas. Fines for failure to comply with CPNI rules can be substantial. Since 2006, the FCC, focusing on one rule regarding internal annual compliance certificates, proposed over $1 million in fines and those fines are not necessarily indicative of the fines the FCC could propose. The FCC is authorized to impose fines of up to $150,000 for each rule violation or each day of a continuing violation up to a maximum of $1.5 million for each continuing violation.https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-enforcement-advisory- voip-cpni The rules adopted in the Order are effective either six months after the Order is published in the Federal Register or on receipt of Office of Management and Budget approval of the new rules depending on which event is later.

It is a concept album based on the 1986 science fiction novel The Songs of Distant Earth by Arthur C. Clarke. The album reached No. 24 on the UK Albums Chart. == Background == In 1993, Oldfield completed his 1992‚Äì1993 tour to promote his previous album, Tubular Bells II (1992), his first concert tour since 1984. The album was his first of the initial three that he was contracted to produce for Warner Music UK, following his signing to the label in 1992. When Oldfield was ready to record a follow-up, label chairman Rob Dickins suggested that he make a concept album based on the 1986 science fiction novel The Songs of Distant Earth by Arthur C. Clarke. Oldfield deemed the story not one of Clarke's best, \\"but it had lots of atmosphere\\" and started to think of musical ideas on travelling through space and landing on another world and the events that take place on it. The title of the book particularly attracted Oldfield, calling it \\"intrinsically musical, a natural starting point\\". Oldfield travelled Sri Lanka, where Clarke was living, to discuss the possibility and found out he was a fan of his soundtrack to the 1984 film The Killing Fields and felt \\"delighted\\" about the album. Clarke was given a copy of Tubular Bells II for listening; he was impressed enough and agreed to collaborate. == Writing and recording == Oldfield deliberately avoided to retell the story in the same sequence as the book and opted to have the album follow the plot \\"loosely\\". The story details the destruction of Earth in the year 3600 after the Sun goes nova, for which the planet has 1,600 years to prepare, and sends spaceships to nearby planetary systems. The album took longer for Oldfield to complete than he had initially planned, because the album's science fiction concept limited the type of instruments he could use. This was the case with his 12-string and acoustic guitars that he usually played, which he thought sounded too \\"Earth-bound\\" for the album. Instead he had to create a \\"new vocabulary\\" of sounds in the studio. Oldfield felt he widened his sound as a result, departing from the Celtic and folk-oriented music that he became known for and write songs that would appeal across multiple generations. Looking back on the album, Oldfield classed it as \\"very ambient\\". Oldfield made extensive use of samples, much of which originated from sampling CDs, including Datafile One (1991) by Zero-G, and film soundtracks. This was the case for the world music vocal sounds. Included are sounds recorded in Polynesia and Lapland. While the album was being mixed and cut, Oldfield was concerned that being an solely digital recording, it would sound too \\"angular\\". As a test, a copy was made onto recording tape using Dolby SR, a type of noise reduction, which he thought produced some nice results but greater loss of clarity. The liner notes contains a foreword by Clarke about the development of his book, from short story to novel. He ends it with a note about the album: \\"Since the finale of the novel is a musical concert, I was delighted when Mike Oldfield told me that he wished to compose a suite inspired by it. I was particularly impressed by the music he wrote for The Killing Fields and now, having played the CD-ROM of The Songs of Distant Earth, I feel he has lived up to my expectations. Welcome back into space, Mike: there's still lots of room out here.\\" ==CD-ROM content== Oldfield faced difficulty in writing music to the story at first and needed some \\"in between space\\" to help visualise it. This was alleviated when he received a copy of the 1993 graphic adventure puzzle game Myst for the PC and was impressed with the graphics, which greatly influenced his decision to have 3D computer- generated video accompany the music for the album on the Enhanced CD format, combining features of a standard CD with CD-ROM content. The result was graphics that Oldfield had in his mind while writing the music. Oldfield felt contemporary music at the time of recording lacked any real excitement, but felt the reverse as he worked on the interactive technology. This, and his interest in Myst, sparked his wish to make his own game that helped the player on their own spiritual development. While composing for the CD-ROM Oldfield had trouble adapting a theme by Jean Sibelius for it, which turned into a rage where be \\"banged out a theme. Like a sort of miracle, it worked!\\" The CD-ROM allows users to travel through a futuristic city onboard a spaceship and towards a central control system, inside of which houses a musical tower. The user must answer a musical puzzle which provides a series of options that trigger a different song on the album. == Release == The album was released in the UK on 21 November 1994. It went to No. 24 on the UK Albums Chart and reached gold certification by the British Phonographic Industry. Its US release followed in January 1995 on Reprise Records. The album was released as a CD and, shortly afterwards, as an Enhanced CD of which two versions were made. Both versions' initial pressings contained an image of a manta ray flying in front of a planet on the front cover; later pressings change the image to one of a suited man holding a glowing orb with manta rays flying overhead. The second pressing of the enhanced CD contains slightly more multimedia content, including the full version of the \\"Let There Be Light\\" video. The CD audio content is the same on all versions of the album. It was also released as a vinyl LP, which has become a rare item. The enhanced CD content, for Apple Macintosh PowerPC computers only, was rendered on Silicon Graphics computers and used Apple's QuickTime II technology.

The National Theatre belongs to the most important Czech cultural institutions, with a rich artistic tradition, which helped to preserve and develop the most important features of the nation‚Äìthe Czech language and a sense for a Czech musical and dramatic way of thinking. Today the National Theatre consists of three artistic ensembles: opera, ballet and drama. They alternate in their performances in the historic building of the National Theatre, in the Theatre of the Estates and in the Kolowrat Theatre. All three artistic ensembles select their repertoire both from classical heritage, and modern authors. ==Initial design and construction, 1844 to 1881== Seal Council for the establishment of the National Theatre in Prague, 1851 The cornerstone of the National Theatre was laid on 16 May 1868, but the idea of building a theatre dates back to the autumn of 1844 at the gatherings of patriots in Prague. An application was submitted by Franti≈°ek Palack√Ω to the Provincial Committee of the Bohemian Assembly on 29 January 1845, requesting \\"the privilege of constructing, furnishing, maintaining and managing\\" of an independent Czech theatre. The application was granted in April 1845, but it was not until six years later ‚Äì in April 1851 ‚Äì that the founding Society for the Establishment of a Czech National Theatre in Prague made the first public appeal to start a collection. A year later the proceeds went toward the purchase of land belonging to a former salt works covering an area of not quite which determined the magnificent site of the theatre on the banks of the river Vltava facing the panorama of Prague Castle, but at the same time the cramped area and trapezium shape posed challenging problems for the designers of the building. The era of von Bach absolutism brought to a halt preparations for the envisaged theatre and supported the concept of a modest provisional building, which was erected on the south side of the theatre parcel by architect Vojtƒõch Ign√°c Ullmann and opened on 18 November 1862. The building of the Provisional Theatre then became a constituent part of the final version of the National Theatre; its outside cladding is visible to this day in the elevated section of the rear part of the building, and the interior layout was only obliterated following the latest reconstruction of the National Theatre in 1977 ‚Äì 1983. Simultaneously with the realization of this minimal programme asserted by F.L. Rieger and the Provincial Committee, the young progressive advocates of the original ambitious concept of the building (Sladkovsk√Ω, Tyr≈°, Neruda, H√°lek) launched an offensive. In 1865 these men attained leading positions in the Society and requested the 33-year-old professor of civil engineering at the Prague Technical College, architect Josef Z√≠tek, to draft a design for the National Theatre. He then came out on top in a later-declared open competition, and in 1867 construction work began. Interior of the National Theatre On 16 May 1868, the foundation stone was laid, and in November the foundations were completed. In 1875, the new building reached its full height and in 1877 the theatre was roofed over. As of 1873 there was an ongoing competition for the interior decoration of the building, the scenario of which had been elaborated by a special commission under the leadership of Sladkovsk√Ω. On the one hand, the themes were in the spirit of the Neo- Renaissance concept of a classic building. On the other hand, they were inspired by the current enthusiasm for Slavonic mythology and the stories of the Manuscripts; both of these concepts were based on Josef M√°nes' paintings and connected with the contemporary style of romantic landscape painting (also linked to Czech history). They provided the fundamental ideology guiding artistic expression, which today is described as the art of the generation of the National Theatre. The theatre includes a triga (a three-horse chariot) and 10 exterior allegorical sculptures by Bohuslav Schnirch, 10 more exterior pieces by Anton√≠n Wagner, the stone pieces by Max Verich and an interior sculpted pediment group over the proscenium arch by Schnirch. ===Grand opening=== The National Theatre was opened for the first time on 11 June 1881, to honour the visit of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria. Bed≈ôich Smetana's opera Libu≈°e was given its world premiere, conducted by Adolf ƒåech. Another 11 performances were presented after that. Then the theatre was closed down to enable the completion of the finishing touches. While this work was under way a fire broke out on 12 August 1881, which destroyed the copper dome, the auditorium and the stage of the theatre. The fire was seen as a national catastrophe and was met with a mighty wave of determination to take up a new collection: Within 47 days a million guldens were collected. This national enthusiasm, however, did not correspond to the behind-the-scenes battles that flared up following the catastrophe. Architect Josef Z√≠tek was no longer in the running, and his pupil architect Josef Schulz was summoned to work on the reconstruction. He was the one to assert the expansion of the edifice to include the block of flats belonging to Dr. Pol√°k that was situated behind the building of the Provisional Theatre. He made this building a part of the National Theatre and simultaneously changed somewhat the area of the auditorium to improve visibility. He did, however, take into account with utmost sensitivity the style of Z√≠tek's design, and so he managed to merge three buildings by various architects to form an absolute unity of style. ==Reconstruction and reopening, 1883 to 1977== New stage of the theatre, built in the 1980s The interior artwork was done by Mikol√°≈° Ale≈° and Franti≈°ek ≈Ωen√≠≈°ek. The building of the National Theatre was inaugurated on 18 November 1883. The building, with perfect technical equipment (electric illumination, a steel-constructed stage), served without any extensive modifications for almost one hundred years. It was only on 1 April 1977, following a performance of the Lantern by Jir√°sek, that the theatre was closed down for six years. ==Additional reconstruction, 1977 to 1983 and after== Architect Zdenƒõk V√°vra was appointed to take charge of the overall reconstruction work. This extensive project was combined with the completion of work on the entire setting of the theatre. The work was completed to meet an important deadline, which was the date of the 100th anniversary of the opening of the National Theatre: 18 November 1983. On that day the theatre was handed over to the public again with a performance of Smetana‚Äôs Libu≈°e. The historic building, noted for its beautiful architecture, also includes an annex of modern design which contains offices and the main box office. Today it functions as the main stage of the three artistic ensembles of the National Theatre: drama, opera and ballet. In 1989 the general director of the National Theatre, composer Ji≈ô√≠ Pauer was dismissed from his post because of his support for the policies of the former Communist Czechoslovak government. Pauer locked all staff out of the National and Smetana theatres on 17 November 1989 to prevent members of the opera, ballet and drama companies from staging protest performances. After a three-week strike Pauer was replaced by Ivo ≈Ω√≠dek.News item in Opera, March 1990, p291. == Management == National Theatre in Prague At first the National Theatre was supported by a private guild of individuals with a director managing its affairs on behalf of the guild. Lack of subsidy caused some financial and artistic difficulties, but without long-term damage to the growth or status of the institution.Eckstein, Pavel. Prague's National Opera. Opera, August 1964, Vol 15 No 8, p517-524. In 1900 the contract for the guild which had steered the theatre through its early years was not renewed by the regional government, and as a result of growing dissatisfaction with the artistic levels, the National Theatre transferred its management to a new National Theatre Company. In addition, most of the people associated with the guild were considered to be conservative in outlook, while the new Company were liberals, receptive to fresh ideas. The composer Karel Kova≈ôovic was made opera director, and as a conductor, his work became noticeable in improvements in the orchestra, chorus and solo ensemble. He also attracted leading singers to the ensemble, such as Karel Burian (later a Wagnerian tenor at Bayreuth), Otakar Ma≈ô√°k, Emil Pollert, and Gabriela Horvatova. After the death of Kova≈ôovic in 1920, Otakar Ostrƒçil took over, continuing the progressive artistic direction and leading a thorough renovation of the stagings. He began with the first performance of The Excursions of Mr. Brouƒçek, and mounted Berg's Wozzeck immediately after its premiere, leading to a scandal and the threat of his dismissal. The National Theatre is overseen by the director, and the advisory body of the Council of the National Theatre. The advisory board has 11 to 13 members, who are appointed and dismissed by the director. Current members of the council include: JUDr. Pavel Smutn√Ω, Prof. Dr. Dadja Altenburg Pe≈°ta Kohl, Ing. Petr Dvo≈ô√°k, Ing. Ji≈ô√≠ Mace≈°ka, JUDr. Vlasta Form√°nkov√°, Ing. Bohdan Wojnar, Prof. Ing. Ji≈ô√≠ Draho≈°, DrSc., dr.h.c., Pavel Kohout, Ing. Old≈ôich ƒåernoch CSc. and Ing. Peter Paleƒçka. In 2019 the National Theatre and State Opera in Prague were the place of protests and disruption by artists and staff, including an open letter complaining at the 'non-transparent' appointment of Per Boye Hansen as Artistic Director.Newsdesk. Opera, July 2019, Vol.70 No.7, p819-820. ==Komerƒçn√≠ banka Award== On 4 May 2005, Komerƒçn√≠ banka signed an agreement with the National Theatre in Prague to annually honor the most prominent acts performed at the Czech National Theatre in overall three categories ‚Äì ballet, drama and opera.

Loi fought from 1948 to 1962, and retired with a record of 115 wins (26 KOs), 3 losses and 8 draws. Loi is considered one of the greatest fighters of all time at his weight and one of the best fighters to come out of Italy. ==Biography== Loi's grave at the Monumental Cemetery of Milan, Italy, in 2015 Loi was born in Trieste in 1929, to a father from Sardinia and mother from Friuli Venezia Giulia. Loi fought many outstanding fighters in his career, including three bouts with lightweight great Carlos Ortiz. Although all their fights were close, Loi won two out of three bouts, which were all for the world light welterweight title. The first bout, which was nationally televised in the USA, took place on 16 June 1960 at Cow Palace in Daly City, California. In what would be one of only two US appearances, Loi was defeated after 15 rounds, with a controversial split- decision in Ortiz' favour. Less than three months later the two met again for a rematch, this time in Loi's native Italy. The bout took place at Milan's famous San Siro stadium, in front of a record crowd of 65,000. Loi came through strongly in the late rounds to become World Champion by majority decision. The next year a third bout took place, again at the San Siro. Loi knocked down Ortiz in the sixth and earnt a victory by unanimous decision to defend his title. Loi was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2005. His daughter Bonaria accepted the award on his behalf, because Loi was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Loi died in January 2008 at the age of 78 in Treviso, Italy, and is buried at the Monumental Cemetery of Milan. ==Professional boxing record== ==See also== * Legends of Italian sport - Walk of Fame * Lineal championship * List of light welterweight boxing champions ==ReferencesDuilio Loi - CBZ Profile Category:1929 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Trieste Category:Italian male boxers Category:Lightweight boxers Category:Light- welterweight boxers Category:Welterweight boxers Category:World Boxing Association champions Category:World boxing champions Category:International Boxing Hall of Fame inductees Category:Deaths from Alzheimer's disease ","title":"Duilio Loi"},{"id":"1434666","text":"Steven Gregory Drozd (born June 11, 1969) is an American musician and actor. He is a composer, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter for the Flaming Lips, Electric W√ºrms and other projects. ==Early life== The son of musician Vernon Drozd, he was born in Houston, Texas, and grew up in Richmond and Rosenberg, Texas, with three brothers and a sister. From the age of ten, he played drums with his father's polka band and later played piano in various country honky tonk groups. After high school, Drozd moved to Oklahoma City and performed, mainly on drums, with a number of underground bands in the area. ==The Flaming Lips== Drozd joined the Flaming Lips in 1991 as a drummer. While his style is deeply influenced by the big drum sounds of the 1970s, his time spent with his father's polka band helped him develop a sense of delicacy and syncopation, allowing for transitions through an articulate and dynamic touch. His thick grooves, with episodes of odd-time funk, are interspersed with straight ahead rock, mixing and jumping between various genres. In 2002, when drummer and percussionist Kliph Scurlock joined to the band, Drozd assumed the guitar, and he also plays keyboards, bass and drums, and sings. ==Other ventures== He has appeared on a number of recordings of other artists including Elliott Smith's From a Basement on the Hill, Jay Farrar's Sebastopol and ThirdShiftGrottoSlack and Steve Burns' Songs for Dustmites. He worked again with Burns on a children's psychedelic music project called Stevensteven. Drozd is featured on online release of Cake's B-sides and Rarities (2007). He is the songwriting/musician half of You in Me, a Neil Diamond inspired duo, with Alan Novey. Drozd writes the songs and Novey sings them as a tribute to Diamond. They have released a 7\\" inch double A-side with the songs \\"Hot Coffee\\" and \\"The Drifter\\" on the Flights of Fancy label. In 2013 Drozd created and directed a volunteer group of music students at ACMUCO called the Mutating Cell Ensemble, whose goal is to experiment with polyrhythm and repetition. They have performed once. The artist Peise and Christmas LP \\"Atlas Eets Christmas\\" is a collection of elevator music-style covers and originals, culled from the home recordings of Drozd with the imagery and myth being from the imagination of Wayne Coyne. Drozd and Coyne now have a second group together called Electric W√ºrms- influenced by prog rock, krautrock and punk rock- their goal is to explore the outer reaches of traditional \\"rock\\" music as well performing Flaming Lips deeper cuts. Nashville-based Linear Downfall completes the ensemble. Drozd composed and performed on the song \\"Mattress Warehouse\\" by Foxygen, off their album ...And Star Power, released on October 14, 2014. ==Film productions== In the Flaming Lips' film Christmas on Mars (2008), he plays Major Syrtis, the main character of the film.

He was a member of the Beaver Club and was known as the MarquisSunset Canada : British Columbia and beyond, Archie Bell, The Page Co., Boston 1920 &1918, p. 114 for his pre-eminent position in the fur trade and his refined style of living. Both McTavish Street and the McTavish Reservoir in Montreal are named for him. His home and monument in the Golden Square Mile were longstanding landmarks in Montreal. Renowned for his generosity, when the Chief of the Clan MacTavish had fallen on hard times and was forced to sell their seat, Dunardry, McTavish bought it back for the clan and gave his eldest son employment in Montreal. ==Highlands Background== In 1751, Simon McTavish was born at Stratherrick in the Scottish Highlands, the son of John McTavish (1701‚Äì1774), tacksman of Garthbeg, who bore the arms of the McTavishes of Garthbeg. His mother, Mary Fraser (1716‚Äì1770) of Garthmore, was descended through Simon Fraser of Dunchea and the Frasers of Foyers, from an illegitimate son of the 1st Lord Lovat.Articles by Marie Fraser of Canada The Fraser-McCord Connection McTavish's father had fought as an officer with the Jacobite armies at the Battles of Culloden and Falkirk Muir, and he was one of the few who were specifically named as to not receive a pardon from George II after the Jacobites were defeated.The Lost Families of Stratherrick, Strathnairn, and Dunmaglass, Inverness-shire, Scotland In 1757, General Simon Fraser of Lovat appointed John McTavish a Lieutenant in his newly raised 78th Fraser Highlanders.K Harper, 78th Fighting Frasers. A short History of the Old 78th Regiment or Fraser‚Äôs Highlanders PP80-1, drawing on the Army lists. Apparently changing his name to 'Fraser' so as to escape the authorities, Simon's father went with the regiment to Nova Scotia and fought for the British at the Battle of Louisburg, where he was severely wounded and left. Unable to fight at the Battle of Quebec, he was only well enough to be sent home \\"as an act of charity to him and his family\\" in 1761.Amherst to Murray, 11 August 1761; PRO, WO34/3, f. 105 Simon's two elder brothers were taken into the care of their father's friend, Dugald MacTavish of Dunardry, Chief of the Clan MacTavish, and in 1764, at the age of thirteen, young Simon was sent to New York with his sister and her husband, Hugh Fraser (1730-1814) of Brightmoney, Captain in the 78th Fraser Highlanders. ==North American fur trade== Having found an apprenticeship with a Scots merchant at New York, McTavish recognized the opportunities offered by the fur trade. By 1769, he was working for himself and in 1772 he went into partnership with William Edgar (1736-1820) at Detroit. In the Niagara Region, it was said he started trading in deerskins and muskrats, and only later became involved with the more valuable furs. Over the next few years, McTavish prospered in the trading of furs, and in 1773, with a new partner, James Bannerman, he extended his operations to Grand Portage on Lake Superior. At that important fur trade rendezvous, while other American traders concentrated on the south and west, McTavish understood that he would have access to fur pelts that were found in much greater quantity and were of better quality in the colder climate north west of the Great Lakes. Although at the time the Hudson's Bay Company controlled the prime north- westerly areas for fur trapping, there was still a relatively lucrative route from Montreal westward via the Ottawa River and out across Georgian Bay and the Great Lakes Region and into Manitoba. Most of the trade at Grand Portage went through Montreal. In 1775‚Äì76, McTavish had the great fortune to winter at Detroit, well stocked with trade goods for the next season, he made an expedition with George McBeath. The American Continental Army occupied Montreal that winter, preventing the Montreal traders from getting their goods to Grand Portage in the summer of 1776. This enabled McTavish, with little competition, to obtain furs which he valued at ¬£15,000 and took to England to sell in a high market.Dictionary of National Biography ==Montreal== North West Company - Coat of Arms In the meantime, the Americans had withdrawn from Quebec, and McTavish transferred his operations to Montreal. He continued to trade on his own through the Revolutionary War, supplying goods both at Grand Portage and Detroit, and speculating in rum for the British soldiers at Detroit and Niagara. By the end of the war, he was able to put together a group of business investors and trapper/explorers to create the North West Company. With the Frobisher brothers he owned 37.5% of the company's shares and upon the death of Benjamin Frobisher in 1787 McTavish became the man in charge of the business. A restructuring of the company a few months later saw the shrewd McTavish gain control of eleven of the company's twenty shares. Most important, he was managing partner of a new Montreal firm, McTavish, Frobisher and Company, which imported the North West Company's goods and forwarded its furs to the London market, taking commissions on all transactions. The vertical integration of the business was extended in 1792, when the firm of McTavish, Fraser and Company was established in London itself, to procure the trade goods at source and sell the furs. From his headquarters in Montreal, over the next sixteen years McTavish built a business empire that stretched from the Labrador coast to the Rocky Mountains and in the process made himself a wealthy man. As the fur trade expanded across Rupert's Land, the HBC's financial dominance allowed them to take the advantage. The HBC had rejected the Nor‚ÄôWesters‚Äô request for the right to bring in goods via Hudson Bay, so at a great cost of ¬£45,000 McTavish sent two expeditions to establish footholds for the NWC. These actions did not bring the desired effect and the NWC also failed in receiving a charter from the British government, leaving just one alternative ‚Äî an attempt to purchase a majority of the shares in the HBC. During his time in Britain, Simon McTavish had befriended the chief of Clan MacTavish, and on the chief's death, Simon brought one of the sons into the North West Company. In 1799, McTavish did something that gave him great personal satisfaction: the acquisition of the Dunardary estate in North Knapdale, Argyll, which had been the ancestral home for the heads of the McTavish (MacTavish) clan for several hundred years. Although Simon's own family had been closely associated with clan Fraser, it is believed that his ancestors were a branch of the McTavish clan of Dunardary, who had settled in Stratherrick some generations before. As an astute businessman with great vision, McTavish recognized the need for industrialization of Montreal and that need presented opportunities to make more money. In 1802 he purchased the seigneury of Terrebonne where he built two modern flour-mills and a bakery and established a sawmill, encouraging other entrepreneurs to begin the manufacturing of wooden barrels. ==Dunardry and the Chiefs of Clan MacTavish== In 1782, Simon's father's friend and the guardian of Simon's two elder brothers, Dugald MacTavish, former Lieutenant in the 3rd Foot Guards and the 18th Laird of Dunardry, died. In 1785, Dugald's son and heir, Lachlan, was forced to sell the Dunardry estate, which had for many centuries been the ancestral home of the Chiefs of Clan MacTavish. As mentioned, Lachlan had grown up with Simon's brothers and he and Simon had become good friends over the course of Simon's many trips to Britain. Since the sale of Dunardry, Simon had pledged to his friend that he would assist him in buying back the estate, as soon as he \\"could with conveniency spare the money\\". Two years after Simon learnt of the death in 1796 of his \\"poor old friend Dunardry\\" (Lachlan), he lived up to his word and paid ¬£6,000 to restore his clan's honour and bring Dunardry back to the rightful Chiefs. Though in name Simon had become 'of Dunardry', there was no personal gain attached to this for Simon and he viewed the purchase as an \\"hobby-horse\\".The Myth of a disponed MacTavish Chiefship is put to rest Unfortunately, Simon's magnanimous gesture by the purchase of Dunardry became something of a burden to Lachlan's son as his own sons showed no interest in the running of the estate. They continued to acknowledge how very grateful they were to Simon, but as the property had ceased to be profitable, they were not eager to take ownership of the estate. As such, Simon's sons, who both died young, had been styled 'of Dunardry', even though they too had no interest in the estate and never lived there.The Myth of a disponed MacTavish Chiefship is put to rest Simon's friend, Lachlan MacTavish, had been succeeded as Chief by his son Dugald MacTavish (1782-1855), of Kilchrist Castle; Sheriff of Campbelltown. Simon's sons were well-known to him and waiving the customary cost, Simon took Dugald's second son (John George MacTavish) into the North West Company, where he became a member of the Beaver Club. When the NWC later merged with the Hudson's Bay Company, John continued to work for them and was considered one of their top traders. John later changed the spelling of his name to 'McTavish' in order to match that of his benefactor's, Simon's. John's elder brother, William MacTavish, 21st Chief of the Clan, also entered the fur- trade, working for the HBC and becoming Governor of Rupert's Land and Assiniboia.The paternal lineage of the MacTavish ChiefsThe Myth of a disponed MacTavish Chiefship is put to rest The Chiefs of Clan MacTavish remained in Canada, and the present 27th Chief was born at Montreal in 1951.The paternal lineage of the MacTavish Chiefs ==Family and Monument== Simon McTavish's Montreal home in what would become the Golden Square Mile The McTavish mausoleum and monument within the grounds of his house on the slopes of Mount Royal.

Directly after the marriage, they moved to London, where McTavish hoped to live permanently, but his new wife became depressed there and they returned to Montreal in the spring of 1795. The McTavishes had six children, four of whom lived to adulthood, but only one married. A monument stands to their four surviving children at Chiswick Parish Church: *Mary McTavish (1796-1819).

McTavish Street, bordering the westerly side of McGill University was named in his honor, as was McTavish reservoir, just north of the university. His McGillivray nephews organised his funeral, settled his will and built a memorial for him within the grounds of his house on the slopes of Mount Royal. They built a twenty- foot column enclosed by a walled mausoleum, that once occupied a prominent place in Montreal's iconography. In 1942, rather than repair the monument that had greatly suffered the effects of time due to a lack of maintenance, it was replaced it with a 5-foot granite block.Making Public Pasts: The Contested Terrain of Montr√©al's Public Memories, 1891-1930 By McTavish's will, he instructed that all of his children were to be taken to England for their education, and Mrs McTavish accompanied them in 1806. At London, in 1808, she took for her second husband Major William Smith Plenderleath (1780-1845), the recognized illegitimate son and eventual heir of General Gabriel Christie, by his mistress Rachel Plenderleath. Simon McTavish was related to many of the most important persons in the Canadian fur trade: William McGillivray, Simon McGillivray and Duncan McGillivray were his nephews; Simon Fraser, John Fraser (his London agent) and Donald McTavish were his cousins; Angus Shaw and John MacDonald of Garth were his nephews-in-law. Through his wife, MacDonald was the brother-in-law of David Thompson. Sir Alexander Mackenzie was the cousin of Roderick Mackenzie of Terrebonne, brother-in-law of McTavish's wife. ==References== ==External links== *Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online * * Simon McTavish Papers at Rare Books and Special Collections, McGill University.

Dahl, for Benjamin Wegner Frogner Manor Frogner Manor (Frogner Hovedg√•rd) is a manor house and former estate in today's borough of Frogner in Oslo, Norway. The estate comprised most of the modern borough of Frogner, which has been named after the estate, and Frognerseteren with parts of the Nordmarka forest (Frognerseterskogen). The remaining part of the estate is now the site of the Frogner Park, with the manor house found in the south of the park and the Vigeland installation in the park's centre. The 18th century buildings on the grounds are now occupied by the Oslo City Museum. Frogner was one of the largest and oldest agricultural properties in the Oslo area. In the Middle Ages, Frogner became ecclesiastical property, mostly owned by the Hoved√∏ya Abbey, but was confiscated by the Crown in 1532, preceding the Reformation. From the mid 17th century to the late 19th century, it was owned by wealthy officials or burghers of Christiania, but it was sold to the municipality of Kristiania in 1896 to make room for urban expansion and a new cemetery (Vestre gravlund). However, significant parts of the estate instead became a public park. ==History== Frogner Manor was built in 1750 by Major Hans Jacob Scheel (1714-1774), the first owner to make Frogner his permanent residence. In 1790 the estate was bought by timber merchant and shipowner Bernt Anker (1746‚Äì1805), Norway's richest person at the time. He extended the main building to its present size. There he would reside with his wife, Mathia, until he died a childless widower in 1805. Frogner was bought by his nephew Morten Anker in 1807. His business was hard hit by the economic depression during and after the Napoleonic wars, and he eventually went bankrupt and was forced to sell Frogner by auction in 1836. The buyer was the director-general of the Modum Blue Colour Works, Benjamin Wegner, who was married to Henriette Seyler of the Hamburg Berenberg banking dynasty.Wegner, R. B.: Familien Wegner, Halden 1963, pp. 22-72. In 1848 Fredrik Georg Gade (1807‚Äì59), a wealthy merchant from Bergen, purchased the manor. His heirs held the property in joint ownership, under the management of his son Gerhard Gade (1839‚Äì1909). He was married to an American, Hellen Allyne, and was the United States consul in Oslo.Gade, John A.: All My Born Days, New York 1942, Scribner, pp. 1-28. The former U.S. president and general Ulysses S. Grant visited Kristiania in the summer of 1878, and attended a gala dinner at Frogner with his entourage.Gade, Ingeborg: Stamtavle over slegterne Gade og Wallem, Kristiania 1921, p.56-57. Major parts of the farmland belonging to the manor was sold and built up through the end of the 19th century as the city expanded, but around one square kilometer remained when the city of Oslo bought the property in 1896 to secure space for further urban development and a new cemetery. The last private owner, Gerhard Gade, retained the right to inhabit the house until his death in 1909. This spared the house from demolition, and an economic recession prevented further building on the land. Frogner Manor (Oslo Museum) In the meantime, the house was recognised as an important cultural monument. It was restored and placed at the disposal of the Oslo City Museum. == Oslo City Museum == The opening of the Oslo City Museum at the Frogner Manor's main building in 1909. Reportage image by √òyvind S√∏rensen in Aftenposten. In the main house at the Frogner Manor, the local historical museum of the City of Oslo is located. The museum gives an impression of the capital city's historical development. ==Frogner Park== Part of Frogner Park (2016) The private garden surrounding the manor house was historically much smaller. After Oslo municipality acquired the estate, much of the remaining agricultural land was turned into a public park, the Frogner Park, with Gustav Vigeland's sculpture arrangement (Vigelandsanlegget or the Vigeland installation) erected in the centre from 1928 to 1943. In 1914 the area was the site of the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition. On the outskirts of Frogner Park is Frognerbadet (Frogner Baths), which opened in 1956. Old Frogner Stadium opened in 1901 and was the city's main arena for skating. In 1914 the current Frogner Stadium was built right next to the old stadium. At the site of the old Frogner Stadium, there are now tennis courts. ==Frognerseteren== The current restaurant at Frognerseteren The seter (mountain dairy farm) of Frogner was situated near the summit of the Holmenkollen hill north of Oslo, and included parts of the Nordmarka forest. The name is still preserved in the terminal Frognerseteren station of the suburban Holmenkoll Line, opened in 1898 and extended in 1916. Frognerseteren and the forest was split from Frogner Manor when Benjamin Wegner sold the manor but kept Frognerseteren in 1848. Wegner's heirs sold it to Thomas Johannessen Heftye in 1864, and his heirs sold it to the municipality in 1889, thus making it the first forest owned by Oslo municipality.Andreas Vevstad: Det begynte med Frognerseterskogen: Oslo kommunes skoger 1889‚Äì1989. Aschehoug, 1989 ==Etymology== The Norse form of the name was Fraunar (plural form). The name is probably derived from the word frau√∞ 'manure' - and then with the meaning 'fertilized fields'.

Governments use price ceilings to protect consumers from conditions that could make commodities prohibitively expensive. Such conditions can occur during periods of high inflation, in the event of an investment bubble, or in the event of monopoly ownership of a product, all of which can cause problems if imposed for a long period without controlled rationing, leading to shortages. Further problems can occur if a government sets unrealistic price ceilings, causing business failures, stock crashes, or even economic crises. In unregulated market economies, price ceilings do not exist. While price ceilings are often imposed by governments, there are also price ceilings which are implemented by non-governmental organizations such as companies, such as the practice of resale price maintenance. With resale price maintenance, a manufacturer and its distributors agree that the distributors will sell the manufacturer's product at certain prices (resale price maintenance), at or below a price ceiling (maximum resale price maintenance) or at or above a price floor. == Examples == === Rent control in New York City === \\"Pay no more than Ceiling Price,\\" US poster during World War II \\"New ceiling price lists are here,\\" US Office of Price Administration during World War II Rent control is a system where the government sets a price ceiling on rent (often in combination with eviction limitations and maintenance requirements). When soldiers returned from World War II and started families, which increased demand for apartments, but stopped receiving military pay, many of them could not deal with higher rents. The government put in price controls so that soldiers and their families could pay their rents and keep their homes. However, it increased the quantity demand for apartments and lowered the quantity supplied, and so the number of available apartments rapidly decreased until none were available for latecomers. Price ceilings create shortages when producers are allowed to abdicate market share or go unsubsidized. === Apartment price control in Finland === According to professors Niko M√§√§tt√§nen and Ari Hyytinen, price ceilings on Helsinki City Hitas apartments are highly inefficient economically. They cause queuing and discriminate against the handicapped, single parents, elderly, and others who are not able to queue for days. They cause inefficient allocation, as apartments are not bought by those willing to pay the most for them. Also, those who get an apartment are unwilling to leave it, even when their family or work situation changes, as they may not sell it at what they feel the market price should be. The inefficiencies increase apartment shortage and raise the market price of other apartments.Onko Hitas-j√§rjestelm√§ss√§ mit√§√§n j√§rke√§? , professor Niku M√§√§tt√§nen 16.4.2010 & professor Ari Hyytinen 17.4.2010, Akateeminen talousblogi (in Finnish) === \\"Coulter law\\" in Australian rules football === Uniform wage ceilings were introduced in Australian rules football to address uneven competition for players. In the Victorian Football League (VFL) a declining competitive balance followed a 1925 expansion that had admitted Footscray, Hawthorn and North Melbourne.Daly Anne and Akira Kawaguchi; Competitive Balance in Australian and Japanese Sport Booth, Ross; Comparing Competitive Balance in Australian Sports Leagues, The AFL, NBL and NRL: Does The AFL's Team Salary Cap and Player Draft Measure Up?; p. 30 The effects on financially weaker clubs were exacerbated in 1929 by the beginning of the Great Depression. In 1930, a new ceiling system, formulated by VFL administrator George Coulter, stipulated that individual players were to be paid no more than A¬£3 (approximately A$243 in 2017) for a regular home-and- away match, that they must also be paid if they were injured, that they could be paid no more than A¬£12 (approximately A$975 in 2017) for a finals match, and that the wages could not be augmented with other bonuses or lump-sum payments. The \\"Coulter law\\", as it became known, remained a strictly binding price ceiling through its history. During its early years, the Coulter law adversely affected only a minority of players, such as stars and players at wealthier clubs. Those individuals experienced, in effect, a drastic cut in wages. For instance, from 1931 the ceiling payment of ¬£3 per game fell below the legal minimum award wage.https://www.fwc.gov.au/waltzing-matilda-and-the- sunshine-harvester-factory/historical-material/the-australian-minimum-wage While players at the more successful clubs of the day, such as Richmond, had previously paid significantly higher average wages, clubs that were struggling financially often could not meet the ceiling under the Coulter law. Clubs with a longstanding amateur ethos became significantly more competitive under the Coulter law, such as Melbourne, which had long attracted and retained players by indirect or non-financial incentives (such as finding players employment not related to football). The Coulter law led to at least one VFL star of the 1930s, Ron Todd, moving to the rival VFA, because he was dissatisfied with the maximum pay that he could receive at Collingwood,Main, Jim and Holmesby, Russell (editors); The Encyclopedia of League Footballers (1st edition); p. 438. As a result of World War II, the wage for a regular game was halved (to ¬£1 and 10 shillings) for the 1942‚Äì45 seasons. After the war, the ceilings were modified several times in line with inflation. During the 1950s, the \\"Coulter law\\" was also blamed for shortening the careers of star players such as John Coleman and Brian Gleeson, as they and their clubs could not pay for the private surgery that the players required to continue their careers. The Coulter law was abolished in 1968. However, in 1987 a club-level salary cap was introduced by the VFL and has been retained by its successor, the Australian Football League (AFL). ===State Farm Insurance=== On February 4, 2009, a Wall Street Journal article stated, \\"Last month State Farm pulled the plug on its 1.2 million homeowner policies in Florida, citing the state's punishing price controls.... State Farm's local subsidiary recently requested an increase of 47%, but state regulators refused. State Farm says that since 2000, it has paid $1.21 in claims and expenses for every $1 of premium income received.\\"Florida's Unnatural Disaster , Wall St. Journal, February 4, 2009 ===Venezuela=== On January 10, 2006, a BBC article reported that since 2003, Venezuela President Hugo Ch√°vez had been setting price ceilings on food and that the price ceilings had caused shortages and hoarding.Venezuelan shoppers face food shortages , BBC, January 10, 2006 A January 22, 2008, article from Associated Press stated, \\"Venezuelan troops are cracking down on the smuggling of food... the National Guard has seized about 750 tons of food....

He alleged they had been avoiding doing so in response to the price caps.Chavez Seizes Venezuelan Rice Plants, Associated Press, February 28, 2009 On January 3, 2007, an International Herald Tribune article reported that Ch√°vez's price ceilings were causing shortages of materials used in the construction industry.Venezuelan businesses say Ch√°vez's price controls create shortages International Heralrd Tribune, January 3, 2007 According to an April 4, 2008, article from CBS News, Ch√°vez ordered the nationalization of the cement industry, which had been exporting its products to receive higher prices outside the country.Hugo Chavez Nationalizes Cement Industry, CBS News, April 4, 2008. ==Price ceilings that lead to higher prices== There is a substantial body of research showing that under some circumstances price ceilings can, paradoxically, lead to higher prices. The leading explanation is that price ceilings serve to coordinate collusion among suppliers who would otherwise compete on price. More precisely, firms forming a cartel becomes profitable by enabling nominally competing firms to act like a monopoly, limiting quantities and raising prices. However, forming a cartel is difficult because it is necessary to agree on quantities and prices, and because each firm will have an incentive to \\"cheat\\" by lowering prices to sell more than it agreed to. Antitrust laws make collusion even more difficult because of legal sanctions. Having a third party, such as a regulator announce and enforce a maximum price level, can make it easier for the firms to agree on a price and to monitor pricing. The regulatory price can be viewed as a focal point, which is natural for both parties to charge. One research paper documenting the phenomenon is Knittel and Stangel,RK Knittel and V Stango ‚ÄòPrice Ceilings as Focal points for Tacit Collusion: Evidence from Credit Cards‚Äô (2003) 93 American Economic Review 1703‚Äì29. which found that in the 1980s United States, states that fixed an interest rate ceiling of 18 percent had firms charging a rate only slightly below the ceiling. However states without an interest rate ceiling had interest rates that were significantly lower. (The authors did not find any difference in costs that could explain the result.) Another example is a paper by Sen et al.A Sen, A Clemente, and L Jonker ‚ÄòRetail Gasoline Price Ceilings and Regulatory Capture: Evidence from Canada‚Äô (2011) 13(2) American Law and Economics Review 532‚Äì64. that found that gasoline prices were higher in states that instituted price ceilings. Another example is the Supreme Court of Pakistan's decision regarding fixing a ceiling price for sugar at 45 Pakistani rupees per kilogram. Sugar disappeared from the market because of a cartel of sugar producers and the failure of the Pakistani government to maintain supply even in the stores that it owned. The imported sugar required time to reach the country, and it could be sold at the rate fixed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Eventually, the government went for a review petition in the Supreme Court and obtained the withdrawal of the earlier decision of the apex court. Eventually, the market equilibrium was achieved at 55 to 60 rupees per kilogram. ==See also== * Black market * General equilibrium * Price floor * Pricing * Pricing science * Pricing strategies ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Price controls Category:Pricing ","title":"Price ceiling"},{"id":"1434705","text":"In telecommunications, a spectral mask, also known as a channel mask or transmission mask, is a mathematically-defined set of lines applied to the levels of radio (or optical) transmissions. The spectral mask is generally intended to reduce adjacent-channel interference by limiting excessive radiation at frequencies beyond the necessary bandwidth. Attenuation of these spurious emissions is usually done with a band-pass filter, tuned to allow through the correct center frequency of the carrier wave, as well as all necessary sidebands. The spectral mask is usually one of the things defined in a bandplan for each particular band. It is essential in assuring that a transmission stays within its channel. An FM radio station, for example, must attenuate everything beyond ¬±75kHz from the center frequency by a few decibels, and anything beyond ¬±100 kHz (the channel boundary) by much more. Emissions on further adjacent channels must be reduced to almost zero. FM broadcast subcarriers are normally required to stay under 75 kHz (and up to 100 kHz if reduced) to comply with the mask. The introduction of in-band on- channel (IBOC) digital radio in the United States has been slowed by issues concerning the subcarriers it uses - and the corresponding increase in the amount of energy in the sidebands - overstepping the bounds of the spectral mask set forth for FM by the NRSC and enforced by the FCC. Other types of modulation have different spectral masks for the same purpose. Many digital modulation methods such as COFDM use the electromagnetic spectrum very efficiently, allowing for a very tight spectral mask. This allows placement of broadcast stations or other transmissions on channels right next to each other without interference, allowing for an increase in a band's total capacity. Conversely, it is allowing the U.S. to eliminate TV channels 52 to 69, freeing up 108 MHz (from approximately 700 to 800 MHz) for emergency services and to be auctioned off to the highest bidder, while still retaining (although moving) all existing TV stations.

There, Mills approached the set of two signals that were normally both green. The robbers had, however, changed the first set of signals to yellow, warning the driver to slow down, and the second set to red, telling the driver to stop the train. He stopped, and soon after the robbers launched their robbery. When they got into the cab of the locomotive, they attacked Mills with an iron bar, and he suffered a black eye and facial bruising. He was handcuffed to the train's secondman, David Whitby, in the locomotive's engine compartment. After the robbery, Mills was taken to the Royal Buckinghamshire Hospital in Aylesbury, where he and his second man had to wait for a free police officer to remove the handcuffs.Flashback: The Great Train Robbery, BBC News Online, 3 May 2001The crime of the century == Aftermath == Mills, who was 58 at the time of the robbery, never fully recovered from his injuries. He returned to work in May 1964, and worked for 18 months on light duties. He was then on sick leave from November 1965 until December 1966 with shingles. He returned for one last year in work for 1967, retiring for good at Christmas, with two and a half months off sick that year. Jack Mills sustained severe brain damage from blows to the head. He never recovered and suffered until his death.Crime Archive: The Great Train Robbery (2008) by Peter Gutteridge == Death == When Ronnie Biggs' wife Charmian Biggs' story was told in the Sunday Mirror, it was revealed by rival papers that she had been paid ¬£65,000, dwarfing the ¬£250 compensation that Mills had received. The Daily Mail then launched an appeal on his behalf that raised ¬£34,000, which enabled Mills to move into a more comfortable house in Crewe. Mills died in February 1970 shortly after moving. He died of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, with a further complication of bronchial pneumonia. The West Cheshire Coroner concluded that there was no reason to hold an inquest and that while he was aware that Mills had been injured in the incident, there was no connection as far as he was concerned.The Train Robbers (1978) by Piers Paul Read (Pp 235-236) ==Mills' assailant== The identity of the train robber who assaulted Mills has been the subject of some debate, but most sources agree that Mills' assailant was one of three members of the gang who were never identified. He was referred to as \\"Mr Three\\" by Ronnie Biggs, and \\"Alf Thomas\\" by Piers Paul Read and Bruce Reynolds. Where all accounts agree, is that Gordon Goody made Mills drive the train after the failure of the robbers' substitute driver, and that Charlie Wilson told Mills not to worry and that he would not be harmed and ensured he was left alone after that. Williams (at the time a retired Detective Chief Superintendent) claims in his 1973 book No Fixed Address: :\\"At least three men who were directly involved are still at liberty and enjoying to the full their share of the money stolen and the profits from the way they invested it. One of them is the man responsible for the attack on the train driver. The train driver's assailant is not some phantom figure lurking in the criminal underworld. I traced him, identified him and took him to Scotland Yard where, with Tommy Butler I questioned him. We were certain of our facts but he could not be charged because of lack of evidence suitable for presentation in a court; he had left no fingerprints or identifiable marks anywhere. None of those arrested informed on him although he had completely disobeyed instructions and used violence during the robbery. Otherwise, though, Williams gives no information on this person.\\" In a widely discredited version of the attack on Mills contained in The Train Robbers, by Piers Paul Read, the assailant is given as Buster Edwards. Edwards is listed as the assailant of both Whitby and Mills, although the description of the attack seems implausible given it does not match the description given at the trial and seems to have one train robber doing the entire assault by himself while the rest of the gang was idle. Reynolds dismisses the claim by Read, as the publishers at the time wanted the name of the perpetrator before they would do a deal, therefore Buster offered himself up as the villain (Edwards and Goody were the chief movers behind the Read book).Crossing the Line (1995) by Bruce Reynolds (pp. 222-23) Buster Edwards was the member of the gang who ambushed David Whitby, Mills' assistant (called the \\"fireman\\" or \\"second man\\" on diesel locomotives). At the same time the rest of the gang were moving into position with Roy James, \\"Bill \\"Flossy\\" Jennings\\", and Jimmy White uncoupling the carriages and the 'heavies' ambushing the cab of the locomotive itself.Odd Man Out (1994) by Ronald Biggs (pp. 24-27) Bruce Reynolds claims the person responsible was a friend of Jimmy White, who they had recruited for a previous job to be extra muscle. Reynolds himself was not at the train site as he was the spotter at the Ledburn road rail bridge and met the gang at the rendezvous point at Bridego Bridge after Mills was forced by Goody to drive the train.Crossing the Line (1995) by Bruce Reynolds (Pp222-223) He describes \\"Alf Thomas\\" as \\"a big old boy, very reliable, and would have been useful for the money train\\" (their practice job) \\"because he had the muscle to disable the police cars by tipping them over before we sprayed them with fuller's earth and compressed air.\\" (Crossing The Line, 1995, p. 178.) On 12 November 2012, James 'Big Jim' Hussey admitted a few hours before his death to having carried out the attack on Mills. It has been conjectured that the confession was intended to divert suspicion from the surviving train robbers. == References == == Bibliography == * The Robbers' Tale (1965) by Peta Fordham and first published by Hodder & Stoughton, London (ISBN ). * No Fixed Address (1973) by Frank Williams, first published by W.H.

The town also boasts of being 2nd place in the Resiliency category. The town is part of the so- called \\"Rice Granary Capital of the Philippines\\", and is also remarked as the \\"Sweet Sorghum Capital of Nueva Ecija\\". ==History== The desire of the populace of Cabiao to be free from Spanish domination and tyranny resulted in an uprising on 2 September 1896. Numbering around 700 men (461 listed in the Tablet of Heroes in the Municipal Compound), the townsfolk of Cabiao and the Cabiao Brass Band under the leadership of their Capitan Municipal Mariano Nu√±ez Llanera together with the people of the neighboring towns of Arayat, Deliquente (San Antonio) & Jaen led the siege against the colonizing Spaniards stationed at the Factoria of San Isidro. The Spanish Colonial Government ceded the Philippines to the United States on 10 December 1898 via the Treaty of Paris. Once again the Philippines was under colonial rule, this time by the American. In the last days of the Spanish occupation, the Cabiao heroes participated in the declaration of Philippine Republic in Malolos on 23 January 1899. During the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, Cabiao was one of the fiercely battled terrains of the American forces in pursuit of General Aguinaldo‚Äôs Forces however most of the populated areas of Cabiao have been saved from the encounter. General Pio del Pilar hold out in the marshes of San Vicente and Santa Rita to delay the intruding Forces of General Elwell Stephen Otis under the command of General Henry Ware Lawton. In 1903, the Americans established schools in Cabiao and used the English language as a medium of instructions. Pedro Oreta was elected as the first chief executive of the town under American civil regime followed by the then Mun. President Jose Crespo who established and organized the Presidencia (township hierarchy and organizational plan) constituting the different executive department of the municipality. American occupation in Cabiao has not been as cruel as their Spanish predecessor, however, the people of Cabiao were already afraid to trust the new colonizer. Thomasites missionaries arrived in Cabiao in 1902 as a part of educating the people of Cabiao and in 1903, the Americans established schools in Cabiao and used the English language as the medium of instruction. From 1907-09, Cabiao was placed under jurisdiction of San Isidro and the executive power was then held by the Municipal President of San Isidro. It was in the term of Office of Municipal President Gonzalo Del Leon that the seat of Municipal Town Hall was erected on the land donated by the Romero family. It was during the term of Jose Lapuz that Judge Bonifacio Ysip was elected as delegate to the constitutional convention held in Manila. After almost three decades of peace, Japan invaded the Philippines. HUKBALAHAP (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon) or People‚Äôs Anti-Japanese Army, was then established in Sitio Bawit, San Julian, Cabiao on 29 March 1942. When the Allies between the combined U.S. and Filipino troops finally liberated the Philippines and as soon as the Central Government was established in Manila, Mariano Guevarra was appointed Mayor of Cabiao. He was the chief executive of the town in 1945. Prudencio Ortiz Luis succeeded Guevarra who occupies the position for only a few months. In later part of 1945 after the liberation, most of the people of Cabiao were still in the far flung areas of Cambabalu, Saclang Capampangan, Saclang Tagalog, and Dumanas and it was during this time that the mayor of this town has been appointed by then President Manuel Roxas by the name of Ambrosio Aligada. He was appointed as the Chief Executive of the town from 1945-47. Cabiao was placed under the military government under Pablo Aligada. It was also during the time of Aligada that the Sitio of Palasinan (presently San Gregorio) comprising the property owned by Don Ramon Fernandez were repopulated by the people coming from said the places whereas the area of Bagong Silang were repopulate by the people coming from Buliran, Guyong-guyong, Luyos of which most of them are Tagalogs. Cabiao was governed by Aligada through coercive and dictatorial rule. Isaias Manalastas seated as the progressive mayor through the support HUKBALAHAPs that during that time is at its height from which they fielded their party named Prente Popular however it did not last long due to the suspicion of the military of an imminent grabbing of power where these party is the political front of the Huks. Nieves Pablo, a woman, was the fourth appointed mayor in that same year. At the height of the Huk uprising, when the entire town was the seat of the rebellion, fifty thousand armed men were inducted in Bawit and in Pasong Diablo, only to be captured en masse by General Ismael Lapus. The clearing of the entire forested area of Bagong Sikat and Santa Isabel was initiated to eliminate the lair of the Huk rebels. In 1950, when the first tenure of then Paterno Santiano began, the town's public market was constructed through the support of the national government since the towns income cannot at that time support such huge amount of expenditures. During the first tenure of Gregorio T. Crespo, the old town hall was renovated and the original Cabiao Central School Building has been restored. The gravelling of Sinipit-San Roque Road was made. Santiano was re-elected as mayor after a heavily contested election results. In 1960, Crespo was re-elected as Mayor of Cabiao, and Pedro T. Wycoco was appointed as the Chief of Police. The Gapan- Arayat Road, Cabiao Section were constructed by Golangco Construction and Development Corp. in 1963. In 1979, the town's Public Market was rehabilitated with the help of Angel Concepcion (Member of Parliament) for which main building was constructed contiguously from the previous two small one. Cabiao was governed by Crespo for almost three decades, bringing together the people of Cabiao to live in peace. ==Geography== Cabiao is located at the south-western part of Nueva Ecija bordering the province of Pampanga.

He received the basic education then available before taking a job with a wholesale dry goods firm in the city of Glasgow. ==Career== In 1844, after gaining sound knowledge of the textile business and having saved a small amount of money from ten years of hard work, and obtaining a loan from his brother-in-law John Davie, an ambitious Henry Morgan decided to emigrate. Encouraged by David Smith, a fellow Scot in Montreal, Quebec, Morgan believed a better life existed in Canada than in a Scotland faced with \\"the Clearances\\", and he planned to put his training to good use and open a business there. Immediately upon arrival in Montreal, Morgan joined with his friend, David Smith, to begin preparations to set up a retail dry goods store in rented premises on Notre-Dame Street. Morgan's brother, James, had also been trained in the business and invested in the store but remained in Glasgow to oversee the purchasing and shipping of goods to Montreal. In May 1845, Smith & Morgan opened for business. Records show Morgan working 18- to 20-hour days, but the hard work brought success. The product line was draperies and curtains, sewing fabrics, household linens and a variety of woollen goods. Under the terms of the business contract, the partnership with Smith ended in 1850. Believing he could do better without Smith, Morgan did not renew their partnership and set up Henry Morgan & Company to buy out the business assets. While Smith moved on to Chicago, Illinois, James Morgan emigrated to Montreal to take over his responsibilities in the store. Henry Morgan then hired a representative in London where he could choose from a variety of goods available from the many textile importers and manufacturers' representatives. Within a few years, Morgan's was one of the largest stores of its kind in Montreal. Morgan traveled to Europe on merchandise buying trips and it was in Paris, France he visited Le Bon March√©, that country's first department store. Impressed by what he saw, and aware Americans had begun copying the idea, in 1866 he opened what became the first department store in Canada. The business occupied four floors of a new building on St. James Street, carrying a selection of merchandise with a wholesale cost of more than half a million dollars. Morgan came up with the idea for window displays, frequently changing the products in order to catch the eye of passers-by. As he approached sixty years of age, two of Morgan's nephews joined the firm. Over time, he handed over more and more of the day-to-day management of the business to the younger generation, but in the mid-1880s, Morgan began plans to build a huge new department store. He had been part of enormous growth in the Montreal economy, and the expanding city was creeping from its business hub at the waterfront up the hillside to the residential plateau below Mount Royal. In 1891, Morgan opened his four-storey department store on Sainte-Catherine Street. Others followed, and the area soon became the new centre for retail merchandisers. Two years after his new store opened, Morgan died and was buried in the Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal. His company continued to prosper well into the second half of the 20th Century and stores were opened in several major cities in Ontario. Henry Morgan and Company remained a private family business through four generations until 1960, when it was sold to the Hudson's Bay Company. The large store Henry Morgan built on Saint Catherine Street operated under the Morgan name until 1972. Today, it remains as one of Montreal's most important shopping venues under the Hudson's Bay brand name. ==See also== * Morgan's Department Store * Henry Morgan Building - now HBC flagship store and formerly as Morgan's. ==References== == External links == *Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online Category:1819 births Category:1893 deaths Category:Canadian merchants Category:Pre-Confederation Canadian businesspeople Category:Economic history of Canada Category:People from Fife Category:Businesspeople from Montreal Category:Scottish emigrants to pre- Confederation Quebec Category:Anglophone Quebec people Category:Immigrants to the Province of Canada Category:Mount Royal Cemetery burials ","title":"Henry Morgan (merchant)"},{"id":"1434727","text":"Smeaton's Tower is a memorial to celebrated civil engineer John Smeaton, designer of the third and most notable Eddystone Lighthouse. A major step forward in lighthouse design, Smeaton's structure was in use from 1759 to 1877, until erosion of the ledge it was built upon forced new construction. The tower was largely dismantled and rebuilt on Plymouth Hoe in Plymouth, Devon, where it stands today. The lighthouse is one of Plymouth's most iconic tourist attractions. ==History== ===Construction=== The Royal Society recommended Smeaton for the task, and he modelled the lighthouse on an oak tree. He rediscovered the use of hydraulic lime, a form of concrete used in Roman times. The technique allowed concrete to set under water, as Smeaton put granite blocks together using dovetail joints and marble dowels. Construction started in 1756 at a site in Millbay, where Smeaton built a jetty and a workyard in the south-western corner of the harbour to unload and work on stones. Timber rails of gauge were laid for four-wheeled flat trucks, which were used to move masonry around the site. A 10-ton ship named Eddystone Boat was based here, and transported worked stones out to the reef. The ship carried the 2¬º-ton foundation stone out in the morning of 12 June 1756. The work was completed in August 1759 at a cost of ¬£40,000 (¬£ with inflation).Majdalany, Fred: The Eddystone Light. 1960 Many Cornish tin miners were employed in its construction. To avoid the possibility of press ganging, a practice which was common at the time, Trinity House arranged with the Admiralty that the workers would be immune from the press. Each worker was issued a medal to confirm he was a worker at the lighthouse. The lighthouse was in height, and had a diameter at the base of and at the top of . ===As lighthouse=== After the structure was completed, the lighthouse's 24 candles were lit on 16 October 1759. Each candle weighed between . A timepiece placed alongside the light was set to chime every half-hour (30 min), alerting the lighthouse keeper to the need to replace expired candles. The lighthouse candles were replaced by oil lamps and reflectors from 1810. Further major renovations were carried out in 1841 by engineer Henry Norris, including the filling of a hole in the rock close to the tower's foundation. The lighthouse remained in use until 1877, when it was discovered that rocks upon which it stood were becoming eroded. Each time a large wave hit, the lighthouse shook from side to side. ===As memorial=== Smeaton's Tower ceased operation in 1879 with the illumination of Douglass's Tower on an adjacent rock. In 1882 the upper part of Smeaton's Tower was dismantled and rebuilt as a memorial to Smeaton on a new base on Plymouth Hoe, replacing the triangular obelisk that had been built there by Trinity House as a navigation aid in the early 19th century. The site was opened to the public by the Mayor of Plymouth on 24 September 1884. The foundation and stub of the old tower remain on Eddystone Rocks, close to the current lighthouse. Since the foundation proved too strong to be dismantled, it was left where it stood. In 1860, a new penny coin was brought into circulation on which the lighthouse was depicted in the background behind Britannia, remaining on the penny until 1894. The lighthouse was also depicted on a number of tokens issued during the nineteenth century in Devon with face values from two pence to one shilling. An 1850 replica of Smeaton's lighthouse, Hoad Monument, still stands above the town of Ulverston, Cumbria as a memorial to naval administrator Sir John Barrow. Smeaton's Tower has been a Grade I-listed building since 1954. It is open for visitors, who may climb 93 steps, including steep ladders, to the lantern room, and observe Plymouth Sound and the city. ==See also== *List of lighthouses in England *Grade I listed buildings in Plymouth ==References== ==External links== * Category:Lighthouses completed in 1759 Category:Towers completed in 1759 Category:Museums in Plymouth, Devon Category:Lighthouses in Devon Category:Grade I listed buildings in Devon Category:Grade I listed lighthouses Category:Tourist attractions in Plymouth, Devon Category:Lighthouse museums in England Category:Buildings and structures in Plymouth, Devon Category:Observation towers in the United Kingdom Category:Industrial archaeological sites in Devon ","title":"Smeaton's Tower"},{"id":"1434733","text":"Crime Cities is a video game for Microsoft Windows compatible PCs.

A government-set minimum wage is a price floor on the price of labour. A price floor is a government- or group-imposed price control or limit on how low a price can be charged for a product, good, commodity, or service. A price floor must be higher than the equilibrium price in order to be effective. The equilibrium price, commonly called the \\"market price\\", is the price where economic forces such as supply and demand are balanced and in the absence of external influences the (equilibrium) values of economic variables will not change, often described as the point at which quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal (in a perfectly competitive market). Governments use price floors to keep certain prices from going too low. Two common price floors are minimum wage laws and supply management in Canadian agriculture. Other price floors include regulated US airfares prior to 1978 and minimum price per-drink laws for alcohol. While price floors are often imposed by governments, there are also price floors which are implemented by non-governmental organizations such as companies, such as the practice of resale price maintenance. With resale price maintenance, a manufacturer and its distributors agree that the distributors will sell the manufacturer's product at certain prices (resale price maintenance), at or above a price floor (minimum resale price maintenance) or at or below a price ceiling (maximum resale price maintenance). A related government- or group-imposed intervention, which is also a price control, is the price ceiling; it sets the maximum price that can legally be charged for a good or service, with a common government-imposed example being rent control. ==Effectiveness== An ineffective, non-binding price floor, below equilibrium price A price floor could be set below the free-market equilibrium price. In the first graph at right, the dashed green line represents a price floor set below the free-market price. In this case, the floor has no practical effect. The government has mandated a minimum price, but the market already bears and is using a higher price. An effective, binding price floor, causing a surplus (supply exceeds demand). By contrast, in the second graph, the dashed green line represents a price floor set above the free-market price. In this case, the price floor has a measurable impact on the market. It ensures prices stay high, causing a surplus in the market. ==Effect on the market== A price floor set above the market equilibrium price has several side-effects. Consumers find they must now pay a higher price for the same product. As a result, they reduce their purchases, switch to substitutes (e.g., from butter to margarine) or drop out of the market entirely. Meanwhile, suppliers find they are guaranteed a new, higher price than they were charging before. As a result, they increase production. Taken together, these effects mean there is now an excess supply (known as a \\"surplus\\") of the product in the market to maintain the price floor over the long term. The equilibrium price is determined when the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. Further, the effect of mandating a higher price transfers some of the consumer surplus to producer surplus, while creating a deadweight loss as the price moves upward from the equilibrium price. A price floor may lead to market failure if the market is not able to allocate scarce resources in an efficient manner. ===Minimum wage=== An example of a price floor is minimum wage laws, where the government sets out the minimum hourly rate that can be paid for labour. In this case, the wage is the price of labour, and employees are the suppliers of labor and the company is the consumer of employees' labour. When the minimum wage is set above the equilibrium market price for unskilled or low-skilled labour, employers hire fewer workers. Employers may cut their use of labour by switching to a \\"self- serve\\" model in which customers do an action previously done by staff (e.g., self-serve gas stations); or buying machines, computers or robots to do part or all of employees' jobs (e.g., automated teller machines in banks, automated ticket kiosks in parking garages). Consequentially, unemployment is created (more people are looking for jobs than there are jobs available). At the same time, a minimum wage above the equilibrium wage would allow (or entice) more people to enter the labor market because of the higher salary. The result is a surplus in the amount of labor available. The equilibrium wage for workers would be dependent upon their skill sets along with market conditions.CBO-The Effects of a Minimum Wage Increase on Employment and Family Income-February 2014 ===Agriculture=== Previously, price floors in agriculture have been common in Europe. Since the 1999s, the EU has used a \\"softer\\" method: if the price falls below an intervention price, the EU buys enough of the product that the decrease in supply raises the price to the intervention price level. As a result of this, \\"butter mountains\\" of surplus products in EU warehouses have sometimes resulted.Davig Begg, et al., Economics, 4th edition, McGraw- Hill 1994 In Canada, supply management is a national agricultural policy framework used in Canada that coordinates supply and demand of dairy, poultry and eggs through production and import control and pricing mechanisms designed to prevent shortages and surpluses, to ensure farmers a fair rate of return and Canadian consumer access to a high-quality, stable, and secure supply of these sensitive products. With supply management, the Canadian \\"government sets a minimum price that processors have to pay the farmers, or a 'price floor.' Critics have argued that floor is artificially high, meaning dairy and other products cost more for Canadian consumers that they might otherwise.\\" Supply management's supporters say that the system offers stability for producers, processors, service providers and retailers.Larue, Bruno; Lambert, R√©my (2012).

Detractors have criticized tariff-rate import quotas, price-control and supply-control mechanisms used by provincial and national governing agencies, organizations and committees. The policy has been described as regressive and protectionist and costly with money transferred from consumers to producers through higher prices on milk, poultry and eggs which some label as a subsidy. Canada's trade partners posit that SM limits market access.Larue, Bruno; Lambert, R√©my (2012). A Primer on the Economics of Supply Management and Food Supply Chains (PDF) (Report). Working Paper.

The farmers are paid prices above market determined rates to help them. Support prices helped India gain food security during period of Green Revolution in India ===Alcohol=== ====Scotland==== In Scotland, the government passed a law that sets out a price floor on alcoholic beverages. The Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) (Scotland) Act 2012 is an Act of the Scottish Parliament, which introduces a statutory minimum price for alcohol, initially 50p per unit, as an element in the programme to counter alcohol problems. The government introduced the Act to discourage excessive drinking. As a price floor, the Act is expected to increase the cost of the lowest-cost alcoholic beverages, such as bargain- priced cider. The Act was passed with the support of the Scottish National Party, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. The opposition, Scottish Labour, refused to support the legislation because the Act failed to claw back an estimated ¬£125m windfall profit from alcohol retailers. ====Australia==== A review in October 2017 by former chief justice Trevor Riley brought about huge changes to policy in the Northern Territory, Australia, where alcohol-fuelled crime has long been a problem. The 220 recommendations included a floor price for all alcohol products at per standard drink. In the 10 months between 1 October 2018, the date that the floor price and other measures were imposed by the NT government, and 31 July 2019, there was a 26% decrease in alcohol-related assaults in the Territory. ===Carbon pricing=== Carbon pricing is being implemented by governments to reduce the use of carbon fuels. Carbon pricing can be determined by specific policies such as taxes or caps or by commitments such as emission reduction commitments or price commitments. However, emission reduction commitments (used by the Kyoto Protocol) can be met by non-price policies, so they do not necessarily determine a carbon price. Carbon policies can be either price- based (taxes) or quantity-based (cap-and-trade). A cap-and-trade system is quantity-based because the regulator sets an emissions quantity cap and the market determines the carbon price. The IMF‚Äôs Fact Sheet states that ‚ÄúCap-and- trade systems are another option, but generally they should be designed to look like taxes through revenue-raising and price stability provisions.\\"IMF (2014). \\"Factsheet: Climate, Environment, and the IMF\\" (PDF). International Monetary Fund. Retrieved 2014-08-02. Such designs are often referred to as hybrid designs. The stability provisions referred to are typically floor and ceiling pricesIPCC (2014). \\"Social, Economic and Ethical Concepts and Methods\\" (PDF). UN. Archived from the original (PDF) on 2014-06-29. Retrieved 2014-08-03. (a ceiling price is also known as a safety valve), which are implemented as follows. When permits are auctioned, there is a floor (reserve) price below which permits are not sold, and permits for immediate use are always made available at the ceiling price, even if sales have already reached the permit cap. To the extent the price is controlled by these limits, it is a tax. So if the floor is set equal to the ceiling, cap-and-trade becomes a pure carbon tax. ===US airfare before 1978=== A Boeing 707 at JFK airport in 1970. During the mid-1960s, airfares had a regulated price floor that made flying twice the cost of the 2010s, due to the ending of price controls in 1978. Until the late 1970s, government regulated price floors on airfares in the US made flying \\"absurdly expensive\\" to the point that in 1965, more than 80% of Americans had never flown on a jet. For example, in 1974, US air carriers had to charge at least $1,442 (in inflation-adjusted dollars) for a New York City to Los Angeles trip, a flight that cost as little as $278 in 2013. In 1978, the US government deregulated airfares, on the grounds that flying is not a necessity (like food or prescription drugs), and nor was it addictive (like alcohol). The government deregulated airfares so that increased competition would lead to a drop in airfare prices. By 2011, the inflation-adjusted cost of air travel dropped by half as compared with 1978. By 2000, half of Americans were taking at least one round-trip air flight per year. ==Private sector == While the setting of price floors is often associated with government measures, there are also private sector-imposed price floors. Until November 2016, the National Football League (NFL) set a price floor on tickets that were sold on league websites, a practice which a 2016 court case found to be in violation of US antitrust laws. The price floors were introduced when teams sought to prevent \\"...season-ticket holders from selling tickets at prices below face value.\\" In 2013, the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim declined to participate in Major League Baseball ticket sales through StubHub because this online ticket resale website did not allow teams to put a price floor in place. ==See also== * Price ceiling * Supply and demand * General equilibrium * Resale price maintenance ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Price controls ","title":"Price floor"},{"id":"1434752","text":"The Scot-Quebecers (French language: √âcossais-Qu√©b√©cois), are Quebecers who are of Scottish descent. ==Background== Few Scots came to Quebec (then New France) before the Seven Years' War.Places - Genealogy of French in North America Those who did blended in with the French population. Perhaps the first Scot to settle was Abraham Martin dit l'√âcossais (1589-1664), who by the year 1800 had 7,765 married descendants among the French-speaking population.The Pioneers In 1763, the French population of Quebec was approximately 55,000 when France handed it over to Great Britain under the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1763) that ended the French and Indian War. By the beginning of the 19th century, the Quebec population was expanding slowly as immigration began from Great Britain. Impoverished Scottish immigrants, many the victim of the Highland and Lowland Clearances, saw unlimited opportunity in this huge forested land. The bond between Scotland and France, however, also extended to numerous other areas such as the Gens d‚ÄôArmes Ecossais (Scots Men-At-Arms) who guarded the kings of France for nearly three hundred years. Today in France there are many descendants of these Scots who have lived there for centuries. They carry names such as Campbell and MacDonald, the most famous of the latter being Jacques MacDonald, Marshal of France. ==Settling== Some of these Scottish immigrants settled in Quebec City but many with an entrepreneurial drive kept moving west to Montreal which at the time was little more than a small port town on the St. Lawrence River. By far the majority of the Scots arrived in Quebec with little more than the shirt on their back. John Redpath, who had only enough money for ships passage to Quebec City, walked all the way to Montreal. ==Commerce, science and culture== In 1779, Scotsman Simon McTavish helped establish what would become the North West Company to compete in the fur trade with the English owned giant, the Hudson's Bay Company. Since 1670, the Hudson's Bay Company had been operating an unchallenged monopoly in the territory in the northwest known as Rupert's Land, which comprised nearly half of what is now Canada. In the process, McTavish became the most important businessman in all of Canada during the second half of the 18th century. By the first decade of the 1800s, Montreal had grown to around 9,000 inhabitants and the Scottish immigrants who chose to make Montreal their home soon began to play a key role in the city's cultural, scientific, and business life. Although at their peak, the Scots made up only a small percentage of Quebec's population, they affected the city of Montreal and the Province of Quebec far beyond their numbers. Starting from an almost non-existent economic base, they were instrumental in improving the Province's commercial prospects by exploiting an untapped hinterland. They transformed the small fortified town into the business hub for much of the St Lawrence basin and worked to enhance the Province's economic power. Scots led a wave of immigrants seeking a better life that saw Montreal's population grow from 9,000 in 1800 to 50,000 by the year 1850. Other Scots were instrumental in building the Lachine Canal that turned Montreal into one of the most important and prosperous ports in North America. The canal led to a rapid industrialization that began in the late 1840s with Montreal manufacturers producing products for the entire nation. It was also Scots who constructed Montreal's first bridge across the Saint Lawrence River and Henry Morgan built the first department store in Canada that was the envy of the country. Scot settlers founded many of the city's great industries including the Bank of Montreal, Redpath Sugar, and from headquarters they established in Montreal, Scots were the driving force that built both of Canada's national railroads. Early on, they realized the importance for the mercantile community to create the institutions and instruments that enabled business to be the catalyst for improved standards of living for all its citizens. Because of their work and vision, by 1860 they were greatly responsible for making Montreal the most important city in British North America. Noted for their willingness to help fellow Scots succeed in the new world, they are also remembered for giving back to the country that had provided them with the opportunity to prosper. Scots established and funded numerous Montreal institutions such as McGill University, the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec and the Royal Victoria Hospital. ==Notable Scots-Quebecers== A few of these Scots and their offspring who were major factors in building Montreal and the Province of Quebec into the economic hub of Canada are: *Hugh Allan (1810‚Äì1882), financier and shipping magnate *Montagu H.

The earliest to become more than a small informal group of friends was the National Amateur Press Association (NAPA) founded February 19, 1876, by Evan Reed Riale and nine other members in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is still running as of 2018. The first British APA was the British Amateur Press Association founded in 1890. This is a different organisation from that launched by comics fans in 1978 (see below). The second United States APA was the United Amateur Press Association (UAPA) founded in 1895 by a group of teenagers including William H. Greenfield (aged 14) and Charles W. Heins (aged 17). This became a confederation of small amateur publishers which split into two organisations known interchangeably as UAP and UAAPA. The American Amateur Press Association (AAPA) was formed in 1936 by a secession from what was then called UAPAA. The first science fiction APA was the Fantasy Amateur Press Association (FAPA) formed by a group of science fiction fans in 1937. It continues to be active in 2020. SAPS, the Spectator Amateur Press Society, started in 1947 and is still active in 2012. VAPA, The Vanguard Amateur Press Association, formed in 1945 and lasted until 1950. The first comics APA was started by Jerry Bails in 1964 in the United States. Called CAPA-alpha (sometimes abbreviated to K-a) it grew to its present limit of 40 members. It has become the archetype for most subsequent comics APAs. Its members have included Dwight Decker, Mark Evanier, Carl Gafford, Fred Patten, Richard and Wendy Pini, Roy Thomas, Dan Alderson, Rick Norwood, Don Markstein, Don and Maggie Thompson and Jeffrey H. Wasserman. Michael Barrier's animation fanzine Funnyworld began as a CAPA-alpha contribution. Decker and Gafford were also founding members of the minicomics co-op the United Fanzine Organization. The difference in a co-op and an APA is that an APA is helmed by a central mailer, to whom the members send copies of their publications. The central mailer then compiles all the books into one large volume, which is then mailed out to the membership in \\"mailings\\" (called \\"bundles\\" by a few APAs). In a co-op, however, there is no central mailer; the members distribute their own works, and are linked by a group newsletter, a group symbol that appears on each member work, and a group checklist in every \\"member zine.\\" The first European comics APA was called PAPA and launched by a group of comics fans in January 1978. Soon renamed BAPA (for \\"British APA\\"), it celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary in 2003, but folded the following summer. The APA model was picked up by artists in the 1980s. Groups of artists contributed elements of combined duplicated artworks that omitted the conversational elements of the fandom-based APAs (these pieces are sometimes called \\"assembly art\\"). During this same period, a group of British science fiction and comics fans also set up a short-lived \\"tape APA\\", contributing music and spoken word to a central anthology. The latest innovation is a digital distribution, e-APA. Copies of past \\"mailings\\" are archived at the online resource eFanzines. ==Organization== APAs were a way for widely distributed groups of people to discuss a common interest together in a single forum before the advent of electronic bulletin boards or the Internet. Many were founded in the 1930s and later by fans of science fiction, comics, music, cinema and other topics as a way to develop writing, design and illustration skills. Many professional journalists, creative writers and artists practised in APA groups and email mailing lists. A Central Mailer (CM) (sometimes called a Distribution Manager or Official Editor) is the coordinator of an APA. The heart of the role is the distribution of the association's publication to its members. The CM manages the subscription lists and the deadlines to which the association works. The CM is usually responsible for chasing members to ensure maximum participation although some APAs simply accumulate contributions between deadlines and mail out whatever is available at the mailing deadline. Where the APA requires the submission of multiple copies by contributors, the CM merely collates the contributions. Some APAs involve the submission of camera ready copy; in such cases the CM arranges the reproduction of the material. Most APAs require the members to submit a minimum amount of material in a specified format to a specified number of mailings. This minimum activity (abbreviated to \\"minac\\") is usually specified as something in the form of (for example): \\"at least two A4 pages to at least two out of every three mailings\\". Most APAs also require each member to maintain a credit balance in a central funds account to cover common reproduction costs and postage. In most APAs the CM provides an administrative report listing the contents of each mailing and any business information associated with the association. This can include financial accounts, membership information and some news items. Although most APAs have predetermined deadlines at regular intervals it is normal practice for the CM to specify the next mailing deadlines explicitly in each mailing. Although some APAs are autocratic, most run on a democratic basis and the CM usually chairs any discussions and arranges any management meetings. APAs that require members to submit multiple copies of their contribution (commonly called \\"apazines\\") usually set a limit to the number of members and run a waiting list if this becomes necessary. In many cases people on the waiting list are permitted to contribute to mailings and may receive excess apazines provided by the members. ==List of APAs== This list is not exhaustive.

Her films are primarily documentaries which focus on the real life struggles of the women and children living in the occupied Palestinian territories and Lebanon. She has received over 60 international awards for her films and is hailed as a pioneer in the Middle Eastern film industry. == Early life== Masri was born in Amman, Jordan on April 2, 1959. She is the daughter of Munib Masri from Nablus and an American mother from Texas. She spent her early childhood in Amman and Nablus moving to Beirut when she was in the first grade. Masri was introduced to politics early in her life through her father, Munib al-Masri. Her father was close friends with the leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization including Yasser Arafat and Khalil al-Wazir who would often visit them in their home. Politics played a large role in her family as her father acted as a minister in Jordan in the 1970s. In 1976 she visited Berkeley, California where she had attended a lecture on film theory that fascinated her and led her to pursue an education in film. She graduated from San Francisco State University in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in film production and technique. Soon after, she returned to Beirut and began making films. ==Personal life and Career == Masri met her husband, Lebanese filmmaker Jean Chamoun, in 1977 while visiting Beirut on her summer break from college. The pair connected through their shared love of film making and its ability to influence people‚Äôs lives. Masri then went back to San Francisco to finish her degree and returned to Beirut in 1981. At this time the Israeli invasion of Lebanon had begun, and Masri and Chamoun had to abandon a project they were working on. Instead that summer the pair shot rousing footage under dangerous conditions which they would later use in their films Wild Flowers (1986), Suspended Dreams (1992), Under the Rubble (1983) and War Generation (1989). In 1986 Masri and Chamoun were married and had founded Nour Productions. The couple have two daughters. On August 9, 2017 Masri's husband Jean Chamoun passed away after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease. The pair's partnership led to the production of a total of 15 films, all of which gave voice to stories of peoples living under the hardships of war. Their work is praised for becoming the instrument of change and creativity which they had bonded over and set to achieve. After their first film, Under the Rubble (1983), Masri and Chamoun bought their own equipment allowing them to produce low budget films on their own terms. They lived in Paris for a year to network outside of the Arab film industry, in order to be able to produce and distribute films abroad. The pair received their big break when the BBC commissioned War Generation for their Inside Story. ==Works== === Filmography === Masri's pictures focus on Palestine and the Middle East and have won awards at film festivals throughout the world. Her films revolve around the lives of ordinary people who are living in bizarre times of conflict and how they manage to keep their humanity throughout the reality of their devastating situations. Her films aim to capture authenticity and as a result tell a different story to the stereotypical dehumanization and dismissing of Palestinians rights portrayed in dominate discourses. * Under the Rubble (1983) * Wild Flowers: Women of South Lebanon (1986) * War Generation (1989) * Children of Fire (1990) * Suspended Dreams (1992) * Hanan Ashrawi: A Woman of Her Time (1995) * Children of Shatila (1998) * Frontiers of Dreams and Fears (2001) * Beirut Diaries (2006) * 33 Days (2007) * 3000 Nights (2015) ===Article=== *Masri, Mai.

Pax was seen as the daughter of the Roman king god Jupiter and the goddess Justice. Worship of Peace was organized and made popular during the rule of the emperor Augustus who used her imagery to help stabilise the empire after the years of turmoil and civil war of the late republic. Augustus commissioned an altar of peace in her honour - Ara Pacis and the emperor Vespasian built a temple for her on the Campus Martius called the Forum Pacis. Pax had a festival held for her on January 3rd. In art she is commonly depicted holding out olive branches as a peace offering, as well as a caduceus, cornucopia, corn and a sceptre. Pax is also often associated with spring. == History of Worship == === Early Depictions and Greek Influence === Early Roman worship and mythology was very much based on and adopted from the Greek Parthenon of gods and goddesses.. Ancient Greek deities that aligned with the Roman values of conquest, strength and pragmatism such as Mars and Juno were adopted early on during the Roman kingdom and early republic. Pax was a relatively unrecognised deity during the early republic as she had little to do with the Roman philosophy. However, during this time the Greek city states had been worshipping Pax‚Äôs equivalent - Eirene since the early bronze age where the worship of her peaked during the rise of the Athenian empire and the Peloponnesian war. As Weinstock explained the Roman idea and word for peace (pax) derived from ‚Äòpacisci‚Äô was seen as more of a pact which concluded a war and led to a surrender or alliance with another faction rather than today‚Äôs notion of peace as the lack of war. Peace was seen as the submission to Roman superiority, it was the outcome of war not its absence. Conquest led to pacification. === Pax Romana and Early Empire === Pax worship peaked during Augustus Caesar‚Äôs reign and the early empire. Augustus introduced Pax as a way to stabilise his reign and to signal to the populace that the previous years of civil war and turmoil that was linked to the decay and fall of the republic had ended and that his reign had bought peace and direction to the ravaged empire. Pax first appeared like Eirene with the caduceus and this can be seen in Augustus‚Äô commission of the Ara Pacis or altar of peace and in coinage at the time. Some argue that Pax could have therefore been used more of a political slogan than an actual goddess at the time, a pact to cease the civil war and to bring prosperity back to the empire through the new imperial system.Pax on back of an Antoninianus of Emperor MaximianAugustus often used religious events and expressions to stress his political messages such as when he became Pontifex Maximus or the ‚Äògreatest priest‚Äô. His construction of the Ara Pacis symbolised peace for the Roman citizens under his rule and some colonies were renamed after the goddess and Augustus such as Pax Julia to Pax Augusta in ancient Lusitania, also coinage was circulated in the colonies supporting Augustus as the bringer of peace where his bust in shown and the goddess Pax on the obverse side. Augustus attempted to establish a cult of Pax in the provinces such as in Spain and Gaul like what he did with the imperial cult. Augustus‚Äôs reign emphasised the notion of peace to Roman citizens and recently subjugated peoples as a possible way to bring solidarity to the early empire and to consolidate his political philosophy. The imperial message could‚Äôve communicated that Roman subjects enjoyed the goddess Pax and her benefits only because of the imperium of Augustus and the strength of his armies. The linking between emperor and Pax or her equivalent was not a new idea and had Greek origins with Alexander the Great and then with Pompey and Julius Caesar, in this time Pax was not seen as a powerful god like Jupiter but a ramification of the emperor‚Äôs strength and influence. ==== After Augustus ==== Augustus‚Äô successors during the Julio-Claudian dynasty would continue to stress this notion, Pax‚Äôs image would slowly change around the reign of Claudius where she becomes more of a winged figure. Pax worship continued with Vespasian who established the Flavian dynasty and ended the civil war and instability of the ‚ÄòYear of the Four Emperors‚Äô. Vespasian constructed the Forum Pacis in AD 75 in her honour and continued linking the goddess Pax to the god Janus as seen in the construction of the temple Janus Quadrifrons near the Forum Pacis as the closing of the gates of Janus was seen as the conclusion of war and the start of peace, and was something that Augustus did in his first years as emperor. Pax and peace would later become synonymous with Augustus in the period known as Pax Augusta and later scholars would refer to the time of peace as the Pax Romana, meaning that stability and peace was achieved through the power of the emperor to limit infighting within the empire and through defeating foreign threats such as seen as the subjugation of Germania, Pannonia, and Egypt etc. === Decline of Worship and Christianity's effect === During the evolution of the Roman empire and the Pax Romana the conquered where integrated into society, slaves were freed, and the empire no longer had to be violent with its pacified people. Rebellions and piracy had diminished, and the empire had been consolidated and stabilised under Emperor Hadrian and the Nerva - Antonine dynasty. This led contemporary writers such as Plutarch to write ‚Äúso far as peace is concerned the peoples have no need of statesmanship at present; for all war, both Greek and foreign, has been banished from among us and has disappeared‚Äù. Roman citizens were thus becoming less violent and less willing to serve in the empires‚Äô legions and were becoming more submissive to imperial authority. This however was in antithesis with the Pagan Gods that their forefathers had worshipped and connected to their emperors and legionary armies and thus they became less relevant to the Roman zeitgeist. New spiritual leadership was increasingly being found in Christianity. The Pax Romana had an effect on the adoption and acceptance of Christianity‚Äôs peaceful teachings and less so was Pax the signifier of peace ‚Äì she was being replaced by Jesus Christ. A church leader in the 4th century Eusebius wrote ‚Äòit was not by mere human accident but of God's arrangement that the universal empire of peace came in time for the universal religion of peace.‚Äô The Roman peace at the time however was still regularly sustained by violence, and raids into barbarian territories in Parthia and Germania were still necessary. The Christian religion had an effect on the changing of the perception of the word 'peace' in the Roman world wherein it was transformed into a demilitarised one more accustom to today‚Äôs description of peace. The introduction of Christianity as the empire‚Äôs sole religion in 382AD, the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the barbarian invasions of the 4th and 5th centuries led to the complete collapse of Pax‚Äôs worship. While there were differences in Pax and Jesus, the concept of peace during the Pax Romana could‚Äôve inspired part of the peaceful message seen within Christianity‚Äôs emphasis of peace and its connection with prosperity. === Artistic Depictions of Pax === Depiction of Pax on the Ara Pacis. Republic coins may have alluded to Pax before 44BC but in only using the goddesses future symbols and none specifically included Pax‚Äôs personification or called her by name until after 44BC. The first depictions of peace seen on coinage was depicted in denarii in 137BC which was circulated to recall a treaty between Rome and Epirus after the Samnite wars. On this a women was surrounded with farm animals such as pigs and on the obverse side two soldiers face each other whilst holding a pig for sacrifice. In 49BC a minter known as Sicinus released a denarius with a laurel wreath, caduceus, and victory palm, maybe he did this to evoke the idea of domestic unity and the association of peace with prosperity. Pax under Augustus took her known form as he demonstrated that peace bought wealth, which was contradictory to the traditional Roman understanding that only war and conquest afforded wealth in the form of loot and plunder. Fruits and grains were incorporated into Pax‚Äôs image and this was maybe done to show the return and abundance of agriculture at the time, as many veterans during the empire where often settled onto farms - particularly after the civil wars. Pax was also shown with twins, maybe representing domestic harmony achieved through the Pax Romana. This was because fertility at home was spurred when the father of the household was around and not fighting in the legions. Cows, pigs and sheep imagery on the Ara Pacis showed the abundance of food and animal husbandry during the Pax Romana and these animals were also regularly scarified to Pax. Pax is also shown with a cornucopia to further emphasise the opulence and wealth during this Roman golden era. During the latter years of her worship she was very rarely shown holding the caduceus and she was increasingly shown sharing many more features common with Augustus - hinting at the Pax Augusta. ==See also== * Anthropomorphism *Eirene *Peace ==References== ==External links== * *http://www.unrv.com/culture/minor-roman-god-list.php *http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/HoraEirene.html Category:Roman goddesses Category:Peace goddesses Category:Personifications in Roman mythology ","title":"Pax (goddess)"},{"id":"1434824","text":"Safford may refer to : * Safford, Arizona * Safford, Alabama, an unincorporated community in Dallas County, Alabama * Safford House, a historic home in Tarpon Springs, Florida * Safford Cape (1906‚Äì1973), American composer and musicologist * Andrew Safford House, 1819, designed in the Federal style by an unknown architect * Anson P.K.

Today, it is the biggest downtown area in the city. The district takes the name from Sannomiya Shrine, a branch of Ikuta Shrine. Before the 1920s, Sannomiya was just an edge of the city. The major downtowns were Motomachi and Shinkaichi, which are west of Sannomiya. However, after Sogo Department Store moved to the place in front of Sannomiya Station from Motomachi in 1933, the area started to develop rapidly. Sannomiya is also a hub of many transportation systems in Kobe. JR West, Hankyu Railway, Hanshin Electric Railway, Kobe Municipal Subway, and Kobe New Transit use Kobe-Sannomiya Station as their core station in the area.

ADO.NET is a set of computer software components that programmers can use to access data and data services from a database. It is a part of the base class library that is included with the Microsoft .NET Framework. It is commonly used by programmers to access and modify data stored in relational database systems, though it can also access data in non- relational data sources. ADO.NET is sometimes considered an evolution of ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) technology, but was changed so extensively that it can be considered an entirely new product. == Architecture == This technology forms a part of .NET Framework 3.0 (having been part of the framework since version 1.0) ADO.NET is conceptually divided into consumers and data providers. The consumers are the applications that need access to the data, and the providers are the software components that implement the interface and thereby provide the data to the consumer. Functionality exists in Visual Studio IDE to create specialized subclasses of the DataSet classes for a particular database schema, allowing convenient access to each field in the schema through strongly typed properties. This helps catch more programming errors at compile-time and enhances the IDE's Intellisense feature. A provider is a software component that interacts with a data source. ADO.NET data providers are analogous to ODBC drivers, JDBC drivers, and OLE DB providers. ADO.NET providers can be created to access such simple data stores as a text file and spreadsheet, through to such complex databases as Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, IBM DB2, Sybase ASE, and many others. They can also provide access to hierarchical data stores such as email systems. However, because different data store technologies can have different capabilities, every ADO.NET provider cannot implement every possible interface available in the ADO.NET standard. Microsoft describes the availability of an interface as \\"provider-specific,\\" as it may not be applicable depending on the data store technology involved. Providers may augment the capabilities of a data store; these capabilities are known as \\"services\\" in Microsoft parlance. == Object-relational mapping == === Entity Framework === Entity Framework (EF) is an open source object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for ADO.NET, part of .NET Framework. It is a set of technologies in ADO.NET that supports the development of data-oriented software applications. Architects and developers of data-oriented applications have typically struggled with the need to achieve two very different objectives. The Entity Framework enables developers to work with data in the form of domain-specific objects and properties, such as customers and customer addresses, without having to concern themselves with the underlying database tables and columns where this data is stored. With the Entity Framework, developers can work at a higher level of abstraction when they deal with data, and can create and maintain data-oriented applications with less code than in traditional applications. === LINQ to SQL === LINQ to SQL (formerly called DLINQ) allows LINQ to be used to query Microsoft SQL Server databases, including SQL Server Compact databases. Since SQL Server data may reside on a remote server, and because SQL Server has its own query engine, it does not use the query engine of LINQ. Instead, the LINQ query is converted to a SQL query that is then sent to SQL Server for processing. However, since SQL Server stores the data as relational data and LINQ works with data encapsulated in objects, the two representations must be mapped to one another. For this reason, LINQ to SQL also defines a mapping framework. The mapping is done by defining classes that correspond to the tables in the database, and containing all or a certain subset of the columns in the table as data members. ==References== * * * ==External links== * ADO.NET for the ADO Programmer * ADO.NET Connection Strings Category:Data management Category:.NET Framework terminology Category:Microsoft application programming interfaces Category:Microsoft free software Category:SQL data access Category:ADO.NET Data Access technologies Category:Software using the MIT license ","title":"ADO.NET"},{"id":"1434842","text":"Menzies is a Scottish surname.

He was also the author of a widely respected reconstruction of Old Chinese. == Theories == In 1986, Starostin and Igor M. Diakonoff suggested that the Hurro-Urartian languages belong to the Northeast Caucasian language family. Starostin was also instrumental in the reconstruction of Proto-Kiranti, Proto-Tibeto-Burman, Proto-Yeniseian, Proto-North-Caucasian, and Proto-Altaic. He developed the theory, originated by Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur Khan in the 17th century, but really revived by Gustaf John Ramstedt in the early 20th century, that Japanese is an Altaic language. The Den√©‚ÄìCaucasian hypothesis proposes that Northwest Caucasian, Northeast Caucasian, Yeniseian, Sino-Tibetan, and Na-Den√© form a single, higher-order language family. According to Starostin, the Den√©‚ÄìCaucasian and Austric macrofamilies, together with the Nostratic macrofamily (as envisaged by Vladislav Illich-Svitych, with some modifications), can further be linked at an earlier stage, which Starostin called the Borean (i.e. 'Northern') languages. == Evolution of Human Languages project == Since 1985, Starostin had been developing STARLING a linguist's workplace software. He was assisted in his work by Murray Gell-Mann, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. At the time of his death, he was a professor at the Russian State University for the Humanities, a visiting professor at the Santa Fe Institute, and a frequent guest lecturer at Leiden University in the Netherlands, where he was awarded the degree of Doctor honoris causa in June 2005. Starostin died of a heart attack on September 30, 2005 in Moscow after a lecture at the Russian State University for the Humanities. His son, Georgiy Starostin, is also a linguist. ==Selected works== * 1986. Co-authored with Igor M. Diakonoff. Hurro-Urartian as an Eastern Caucasian Language. Munich: R. Kitzinger. * 1991.

It is located southwest of Bordeaux, and inland from the seaside resort of Biscarrosse-Plage on the Atlantic coast. Near Biscarrosse is the CEL (national test centre) from which numerous French military rockets have been launched for test purposes. Likewise, the CEL has facilities for launching civilian rockets to study the upper atmosphere. Near the town centre, outside the Caf√© de l'orme, there was what is believed to have been the oldest elm tree in Europe. Planted in 1350, this Field Elm Ulmus minor died in 2010 after finally succumbing to Dutch elm disease.http://www.pijouls.com/albums/alblormedebiscarrosse/page_01.htm Legend has it that girls deemed promiscuous were forced to stand naked upon a barrel beneath the tree for a day. One unfortunate, unjustly accused, died of shame, the tree annually producing a corona of blanched leaves in her memory. The commune has an airport, called Biscarrosse - Parentis Airport. == Etymology == The toponym Biscarrosse derives from the Aquitanian language or directly from the Basque word bizkar, meaning 'low ridge' or 'prominence' followed by the Aquitanian suffix -ossum/-os, that was used to mark presence.

To Japanese people, Niseko principally refers to a mountain range and a municipal area. However, overseas the name has come to refer to a wider area of ski resorts encompassing Hokkaido's Mount Y≈çtei, often referred to as the \\"Mt. Fuji of Hokkaido\\", and Annupuri ranges. The name Niseko derives from the Ainu language, and it means \\"a cliff jutting over a riverbank deep in the mountains\\". The Niseko town's main industries are agriculture and tourism. The resort itself, Niseko United, is part of the Mountain Collective. Moreover, the town is renowned for its quality powder snow and world-class facilities, including traditional onsen and restaurants. ==Town== The town had an estimated population of 4,938 as of 30 September 2017, and a density of . The total number of visitors during the 2009 winter season was 201,000.Snow Place Like Home ‚Äì Monocle, 10 Feb 2010 The total area is . ==Resort== Niseko is composed of six ski areas, in order of size: * Niseko Hirafu * Niseko Village (formerly known as Niseko Higashiyama) * Niseko Annupuri * Niseko Hanazono * Niseko Moiwa * Niseko Weiss Niseko Higashiyama Ski Site from Town of Niseko Niseko Mt. Resort Grand Hirafu, refers to the combined areas of Hirafu and Hanazono. Both of these and Weiss are within the municipality of nearby Kutchan. The other three resorts are within the adjacent municipality of Niseko. Of these six ski areas, the main four (Annupuri, Higashiyama, Hirafu, and Hanazono) are sequentially interconnected and may be skied on one ski pass. The lift systems are owned respectively by the Chuo Bus company, YTL Resorts (which purchased Niseko Village from Citigroup in 2010), Tokyu Corporation and Pacific Century Premium Developments. Together they form skiable of what is known as the Niseko United. The lift system comprises 38 gondolas and lifts connecting 61 ski runs and 12 terrain parks. Kutchan's sister city is St. Moritz in a relationship established in 1964. Niseko Moiwa, adjacent to Annupuri, can be skied to from Annupuri but is not currently connected by the lift system. Niseko Weiss has not operated its lifts for decades, but people can still ski in this area, being taken uphill by snow cats. Niseko also has backcountry ski-courses that are unofficially on the maps. To the furthest right of Annupuri lies Sannozaka, an area prone to avalanche but with high quality snow. To the far right of Hirafu lies Higashi One, also prone to avalanche but with challenging backcountry terrain. Near the lower half of Hanazono is a forest route called Strawberry Fields, which is perhaps the most famous run in Niseko. Mount Y≈çtei is also a popular mountain for backcountry skiing expeditions. For the first time, in March 2008, Niseko was voted into the world's top 10 ski resorts. Coming in at No. 6 it was the highest ranked of the new entries in the poll. Originally known primarily for winter sports, Niseko has gradually gained a reputation as a center for a wide variety of summer activities, including golf, tennis, fishing, horseback riding, sea kayaking, white water rafting, trekking, and bicycling.Yoshino, Michiru, \\"Hirafu-Niseko's powder melts hearts\\", Japan Times, 17 November 2006, p. 24. Niseko has also become well-known for its hot springs (onsen), diverse culinary choices, and exceptional whiskeys.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/travel/what-to-do-36-hours-in- niseko-japan.html ==Weather== Because of its northern location, Niseko is fed more by weather fronts that come from Siberia than from Eastern Japan, although all of Japan, especially the west coast of the main island (see Yukiguni), experiences northwest-to-southeast Siberian winds in the winter. The resort is internationally renowned for its consistently good falls of light powder snow and its long ski season which runs from late November until early May. The snow is not as dry as other areas in Hokkaido, but the volume is high, with the average snow depth in March reaching . Niseko was named as the world's No. 2 snowiest resort in December 2007 with annual average snow fall of . First place went to the Mt. Baker Ski Area in Washington State with . ==Infrastructure and development== Niseko, although a growing area, does lack public and private infrastructure in certain areas. Simple public items such as street lighting and winter footpath clearing are left wanting in comparison to other international ski resorts (though this is common in rural Japan). Private infrastructure includes shopping and retail areas from which both are still in growth phase. These facilities are now available in Shiki building in central Hirafu where there is a supermarket, restaurants a cafe and tour desk. Significant infrastructure development ‚Äì initially focused on the road heating and redevelopment of the main street \\"Hirafu-zaka\\" ‚Äì has now been completed as well as removing the overhead power lines and relocating them underground. Counteracting this lack of infrastructure is the high demand for real estate. Foreign-owned companies are developing in the area along with Japanese companies. Purchase demand has expanded from Australian markets to include Hong Kong, Singapore and mainland China. Nightlife and accommodation can be found across the district, Niseko Village/Annupuri/Moiwa is home to many of the established hotel properties, such as the Hilton Niseko Village and The Green Leaf Hotel, Northern Resort Annupuri, Hotel Ikoi no mura and Hotel Kanronomori, Grand Hotel and Hotel Ashiri Niseko. In Hanazono the all new Mountain Center was just finished and the extensive Hyat Hotel is near completion. The Hirafu area is home to established and newer hotels as well as much of the district's modern condominium style accommodation, creating an eclectic mix of bars, restaurants, hotels, and lodges. The Japanese dining experiences that can be enjoyed across the district are extremely popular both among domestic and international tourists. == Transportation == Niseko is located in the southwestern part of Hokkaido. The nearest airport is New Chitose Airport. Japan Rail Hokkaido Taxis Limousines Rental vehicles are some of the many options available to get people to Niseko. The journey from the Airport takes around 2 hours and 30 minutes. Niseko has day trips to many of the surrounding areas. The Hokkaid≈ç Shinkansen (bullet train) linking Kutchan (ÂÄ∂Áü•ÂÆâ) with Tokyo and Sapporo is scheduled to open in March 2031. == Conferences == Niseko Town completely renovated and reopened its Community Hall as a conference center in January 2012. This modern and well equipped center is located in the center of the town close to local restaurants and the Town Council chambers, local schools and is on a well serviced bus route that connects the town with the surrounding resort areas that make up Niseko. There are a wide range of local businesses that can provide support to your conference and the towns Chamber of Commerce office is located in the Conference center to help facilitate conference needs. == Education == Hokkaido International School in Niseko is a private, coeducational day school that offers a western-style education from pre-school through 6th grade for students of all nationalities. English is the language of instruction. Hokkaido International School in Niseko was established in 2011 and is a branch of Hokkaido International School in Sapporo. HIS Niseko and HIS Sapporo are the only international schools on the island of Hokkaido. HIS Niseko offers an elementary international curriculum to its students that prepares them for middle school at the Sapporo School.

Kutchan lies slightly north of the volcano Mount Y≈çtei, and is approximately 50 kilometers west of Sapporo.

As of April 30, 2017, the town has an estimated population of 15,573 and a population density of 60 persons per km¬≤. The total area is . Throughout Hokkaido, Kutchan is known for its proximity to the world famous Niseko powder snow region and for its production of quality potatoes and potato products. Among these products, Kutchan is most famous for manufacturing gosetsu-udon, a Japanese noodle made from potato flour. Jagata-kun, the skiing potato that is the cartoon mascot of Kutchan, indicates Kutchan's two most celebrated aspects. Jagata-kun roughly translates as, \\"little, fat potato boy\\". ==Geography== *Located approximately west of Sapporo.

At only above sea level the town receives greater amounts of snow than the world's leading ski areas such as Whistler, Aspen or Chamonix. Wintery weather lasts from early November through to early April with the snowiest month being January which averages . January is also the coldest month averaging . Kutchan has 4 very distinct seasons with reasonably short spring and autumn periods. The summer is mild with temperatures rarely getting above and the humidity that afflicts much of Asia at this time is only felt for a short period, usually in August. ==History== *Kutchan's name comes from the language of the Hokkaido's native Ainu people. It attempts to mimic the pronunciation of the Ainu word ku-shan-i (which roughly translates as ‚Äúthe place where the channel flows‚Äù), but some claim that the name is derived from kucha-an-nai (‚Äústream of a hunting lodge‚Äù). *1892: Cultivation begins by colonizers from Tokushima Prefecture who had settled in nearby Yoichi. *1893: The village of Kutchan is established. It falls under the jurisdiction of the Abuta village town office (present-day T≈çyako). *1896: The town office of Kutchan opens. *1899: Changes jurisdiction from Muroran Subprefecture (present-day Iburi Subprefecture) to Iwanai Subprefecture. *1906: Administered as a second-level municipality. *1910: On February 8, Rusutsu, Iwanai, and Otaru‚Äôs subprefectures were consolidated into Abuta District of Muroran Subprefecture. Shiribeshi Subprefecture is established in Kutchan. On April 5, the satellite village of East Kutchan (present-day Ky≈çgoku) is formed. Nisekoan, Higa, and the Fujizan area become part of the Shutai village administration zone (present-day Niseko) *1916: Administered as a town-level municipality *1991: 100-year anniversary is celebrated. ==Economy== ===Hirafu=== Kutchan hosts the Hirafu skiing area. Hirafu is commonly mistaken as a section of Niseko town since it is a part of the greater Niseko skiing region. However, to the financial benefit of Kutchan, Hirafu lies within the confines of Kutchan town. Hirafu's largest ski resort, Niseko Grand Hirafu, draws the highest number of both domestic and foreign skiers and snowboarders than any other resort in the Niseko region. It is linked to the ski areas of Annupuri, Higashiyama, and Hanazono which together may be skied on one lift pass. In recent years, an explosively high number of Australians have frequented Hirafu, many of whom have settled in the area and spawned businesses such as pensions, bars, and cafes. Hirafu is also frequented by a considerable number of tourists from Hong Kong, as well as tourists coming from within Japan. Hirafu's expanding tourism industry is often attributed to the steady and copious supply of fresh powder snow, which many claim is among the best in the entire hemisphere, if not the world. While Hirafu's economic boom is undoubtedly an asset to Kutchan town, many fear that such rapid development will alter the price margin of goods and services offered in the village, and subsequently transform the local flavor of Hirafu. The local community of both Japanese and foreign \\"backpacker\\" skiers and snowboarders, who typically operate on a smaller budget than their upscale counterparts, are already being overshadowed by the burgeoning influx of wealthy tourists. ===Agriculture=== Along with short grain white rice, much of Kutchan's surrounding area is devoted to potato cultivation. ==Culture== As the main regional center of population, Kutchan hosts a variety of cultural institutions and events. The town is home to two museums, the Kutchan Natural History Museum and the Shu Ogawara Art Museum. It also hosts the annual Mt. Niseko Kutchan Jazz Festival every July in the center of town, drawing thousands to enjoy the music of Japanese and Australian musicians. ===Jagata- kun=== Jagata-kun, the skiing potato, sitting on top of purple skis in front of Kutchan train station. is Kutchan's mascot cartoon character. Due to the heavy snowfalls in the region, Kutchan hosts several alpine resorts frequented by domestic and international skiers and snowboarders. In the summer, Kutchan is best known for its primary agricultural product: potatoes. The town's two main industries (ski resorts and potato farming) are both reflected in Jagata- kun, a skiing potato. ==Education== *Public High Schools **Hokkaido Kutchan High School, Hokkaido Kutchan Agriculture High School *Middle Schools **Kutchan *Elementary Schools **Kutchan, Hokuyo, Higashi, Nishi, Kabayama Branch School ==Transportation== *Railroad **Hokkaido Passenger Railroad Company (JR Hokkaido) ***Hakodate Main Line: Hirafu Station ‚Äì Kutchan Station **Formerly, the Iburi Line served Kutchan from Date's Monbetsu Station of the Muroran Line, but it was discontinued in 1986. **JR Hokkaido plans to include Kutchan in its planned Hokkaido Shinkansen (bullet train) service, which would connect the town to Honsh≈´ and, consequently, Tokyo. *Roadway **General national highways ***Route 5 ***Route 276 ***Route 393 **Prefectural highways ***Hokkaido Route 58 (Kutchan ‚Äì Niseko) ***Hokkaido Route 271 (Kutchan stop) ***Hokkaido Route 343 (Rankoshi ‚Äì Niseko ‚Äì Kutchan) ***Hokkaido Route 478 (Kyogoku ‚Äì Kutchan) ***Hokkaido Route 631 (Niseko ‚Äì Takahara ‚Äì Hirafu) *Air **New Chitose Airport is the closest major airport to the town, about 2 hours away by car.Niseko Mt Resort Grand Hirafu ==Places of interest== *Mount Y≈çtei *Niseko Annupuri *Niseko Mt.

Under the national constitution, Cuba is a socialist democracy, with the Communist Party of Cuba as the \\"leading force of society and of the state\\", although elections are nominally non-partisan. The nature of political participation in Cuba has fostered discussion among political writers and philosophers. Since Cuba became a one-party republic, the country's political system has been condemned by opposition groups, human rights groups, and foreign Western governments as undemocratic, a dictatorship or an authoritarian or totalitarian state, with all public elections considered to be show elections. Although the media is operated under supervision by the Party's Department of Revolutionary Orientation, which \\"develops and coordinates propaganda strategies\\", the Cuban government contends that the system is democratic. Some observers say the same, describing it as a \\"grassroots\\", a \\"centralized\\", or a \\"revolutionary democracy\\"; rather than a liberal democracy. Fidel Castro was the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC) from 1961 until 2011, and was in power first as Prime Minister and then as President, from 1959 until 2008. Castro's brother Ra√∫l Castro was designated Fidel's successor at the 5th Communist Party congress in October 1997. Fidel Castro officially retired on 19 April 2011, leaving his brother as the sole candidate for First Secretary. ==Procedure== According to the constitution, Cuba is a socialist republic where all members or representative bodies of state power are elected and subject to recall and the masses control the activity of the state agencies, the deputies, delegates and officials. Elections in Cuba have two phases: #election of delegates to the Municipal Assembly, and #election of deputies to the Provincial and National Assemblies. Candidates for municipal assemblies are nominated on an individual basis at local levels by the local population at nomination assemblies. Candidates for provincial assemblies and the National Assembly are nominated by the municipal assemblies from lists compiled by national, provincial and municipal candidacy commissions. Suggestions for nominations are made at all levels mainly by mass organizations, trade unions, people's councils, and student federations. The final list of candidates for the National Assembly, one for each district, is drawn up by the National Candidacy Commission; however, voters can, in theory, veto a candidate, because if a candidate were to fail to gain 50% of the vote, a new candidate would have to be chosen. Anyone older than 16 other than those mentally incapacitated, imprisoned, or deprived of their political rights can vote and be nominated to these posts. No political parties (including the Communist Party of Cuba) are permitted to campaign. Instead, voters can consult candidates' biographies and photographs posted on public locations. All elections take place by secret ballot. Suffrage is afforded to Cuban citizens resident for two years on the island who are aged over sixteen years and who have not been found guilty of a criminal offense. ===Municipal elections=== national and provincial parliaments in Santiago de Cuba The election of municipal assembly delegates involves nomination by voters in nomination assemblies, compilation of posting of candidate biographies, voting by secret ballot, and recall. Municipal assemblies are elected every two and a half years. Municipal elections are officially non-partisan. Nomination assemblies are held about a month before the election in areas within the electoral districts. Each nomination assembly selects a candidate for municipal assembly delegate by a plurality show of hands vote. During regular elections, from 70% to over 90% of the electorate attend the nomination assemblies. Municipal candidates must be at least 16 years old. In elections held on 21 October 2007, turnout was reported to be 8.1 million voters, approximately 95% of the population eligible to vote, which was less than the last such election on April 17, 2005, where voter turnout was 97%. Elections were then held in 2010 and 2013. === Provincial elections === Municipal candidacy commissions submit nominations for provincial delegates to provincial candidacy commissions. The provincial candidacy commissions produce the final list of provincial assembly candidates. === National elections === Cuba's national legislature, the National Assembly of People's Power, has 609 members who sit for five-year terms. Members of the National Assembly represent multiple-member constituencies (2 to 5 members per district), with one Deputy for each 20,000 inhabitants. Candidates for the National Assembly are chosen by candidacy commissions chaired by local trade union officials and composed of elected representatives of \\"mass organisations\\" representing workers, youth, women, students and farmers. The provincial and municipal candidacy commissions submit nominations to the National Candidacy Commission. The municipal candidacy commissions produce slates of recommended candidates for each electoral district, mainly submit nominations for candidates that are also municipal delegates, and first submit their nominations to their municipal assembly who may approve or replace nominations. The final list of candidates for the National Assembly, one for each district, is drawn up by the National Candidacy Commission, taking into account criteria such as candidates‚Äô popularity, merit, patriotism, ethical values and ‚Äúrevolutionary history.‚Äù At least half of the National Assembly candidates selected must have been previously elected as delegates to these assemblies. Although there is only one candidate per seat, candidates must, in theory, obtain the support of 50% of voters to be elected. If a candidate were to fail to gain 50% of the vote, a new candidate would have to be chosen. However, this has never occurred. Elections to the National Assembly were held on 24 February 2008. According to the Cuban Ministry of External Affairs, at the October 2002 elections to the Candidacy Commissions which preceded the January 2003 National Assembly elections, \\"32,585 candidates were nominated for the 14,949 seats up for election in October 2002 at grassroots assemblies in which 81.7% of the voters participated.\\" So far no candidate for the National Assembly has ever failed to gain 50% of the vote, because the candidates put forward by the candidacy commissions usually receive at least 84% support. == Right of legislative proposals == Article 88(h) of the Cuban constitution, adopted in 1976, provides for citizen proposals of law, prerequisite that the proposal be made by at least 10,000 citizens who are eligible to vote. In 2002 supporters of a movement known as the Varela Project submitted a citizen proposal of law with 11,000 signatures calling for a national referendum on political and economic reforms. The Cuban National Assembly Constitution and Legal Affairs Committee tabled the Varela Project citizens' initiative and responded with a counter initiative, the petition for which collected 8.1 million signatures, to request that Cuba's National Assembly amend the constitution to state \\"Socialism and the revolutionary political and social system...are irrevocable; and Cuba will never again return to capitalism.\\" At the same time, millions of Cubans took to the street in support of the government. The BBC reported that some citizens had felt pressured to sign the government petition. The national legislature meets twice a year for a week, to deliberate upon bills proposed by the executive branch. In between the sessions, the Council of State and the NAPP's commissions perform its legislative duties. == Political parties == The Communist Party of Cuba (PCC) is the single official state party,Wikisource:Constitution of Cuba Political parties other than the PCC are illegal. ==Comments== ===Cuba=== Poster urging citizens to vote to make the socialist system permanent and irrevocable by amending the constitution Fidel Castro made many statements insisting that Cuba is a democracy or has democratic features. In 1960, Castro made a speech to the General Assembly referring to Cuba in relation to other Latin American nations, ‚ÄúWe are speaking of democracy. If Government is of people and democratic, people can be consulted, as we are doing here. What is more an example of pure democracy than meetings such as this one. If they cannot call such meetings they are not democracies.‚Äù Castro continued ‚ÄúThose who want to see people‚Äôs democracy let them come here and see this. We can speak to America and the world because we speak in names of a whole nation.‚Äù In this 1960 speech, Castro also criticized many Latin American liberal democracies, describing them as a ‚ÄúPretense of democracy‚Äù, as, he claimed, they did not allow such gatherings. In 2006, President of Cuba's National Assembly, Ricardo Alarc√≥n, stated: \\"At some moment, US rhetoric changed to talk of democracy ... For me, the starting point is the recognition that democracy should begin with Pericles's definition ‚Äì that society is for the benefit of the majority ‚Äì and should not be imposed from outside.\\" Cuba justifies the existence of only one political party by arguing that the PCC ‚Äúis not a political party in the traditional sense‚Ä¶ it is not an electoral party; it does not decide on the formation or composition of the government. It is not only forbidden to nominate candidates but also to be involved in any other stage of the electoral process‚Ä¶ The PCC‚Äôs role is one of guidance, supervision and of guarantor of participatory democracy.‚Äù The Cuban government describes the full Cuban electoral process as a form of democracy. The Cuban Ministry of External Affairs describes the candidate-selection process as deriving from ‚Äúdirect nomination of candidates for delegates to the municipal assemblies by the voters themselves at public assemblies,‚Äù and points out that at the elections to the municipal assemblies, voters do have a choice of candidates. The ban on election campaigning is presented as ‚ÄúThe absence of million‚Äìdollar election campaigns where resorting to insults, slander and manipulation are the norm.‚Äù === United States === U.S. State Department: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: \\"Candidates for provincial and national office must be approved in advance by mass organizations controlled by the government. In practice a small group of leaders, under the direction of the president, selected the members of the highest policy-making bodies of the CP, the Politburo, and the Central Committee.\\" \\"In 2003 there were national elections in which 609 candidates were approved to compete for the 609 seats in the National Assembly. The CP was the only political party allowed to participate in the elections. A small minority of candidates did not belong formally to the CP but were chosen through the same government-controlled selection process. The government saturated the media and used government ministries, CP entities, and mass organizations to urge voters to cast a ‚Äúunified vote‚Äù where marking one box automatically selected all candidates on the ballot form. During the year there were elections for nearly 15 thousand local representatives to the municipal assemblies. After the first run-off election, the government reported that 96.6 percent of the electorate had voted. While the law allows citizens not to vote, CDRs often pressured neighborhood residents to cast ballots. According to the Cuban Commission for Human Rights, the government blacklisted those who did not vote. Although not a formal requirement, in practice CP membership was a prerequisite for high-level official positions and professional advancement.\\" === European Union === Since 1996, official European Union policy towards Cuba has stated an objective \\"to encourage a process of transition to a pluralist democracy via constructive engagement with the Cuban Government.\\" This goal is shared by all member states. The E.U. describes the Cuban decision-making process thus: \\"Elections for the National Assembly, where only candidates approved by the local authorities can partake, take place every five years. When the National Assembly, which meets twice- yearly, is not in session the 31-member Council of State wields legislative power. The Council of Ministers, through its 9-member executive committee, exercises executive and administrative power. Although the Constitution provides for independent judiciary, it explicitly subordinates it to the National Assembly and to the Council of State. Involvement in decision-making and implementation through non-political actors has been institutionalised through national organisations, linked to the Communist Party, representing farmers, youth groups, students, women, industrial workers, etc.\\" === Organization of American States === Cuba was suspended from the Organization of American States (OAS) from 1962 to 2009. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, an organ of the OAS, reported in 1997: ‚ÄúIt should also be noted that the major criterion for preparing this report has been the lack of free elections in accordance with internationally accepted standards, thereby violating the right to political participation set forth in Article XX of the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, which states textually that: Every person having legal capacity is entitled to participate in the government of his country, directly or through his representatives, and to take part in popular elections, which shall be by secret ballot, and shall be honest, periodic and free.‚Äù \\"The nomination of candidates for election to the Municipal Assemblies is done by nominating assemblies, in which all voters are entitled to propose candidates. In practice, however, these district assemblies are usually organized by the Committees for the Defence of the Revolution or the Communist Party, which makes the selection of an opponent of the regime most unlikely. === Other organizations === In 1999, the U.S.-government funded organization Freedom House initiated ‚Äúthe Cuban Democracy Project‚Äù. The project was set up to support and encourage Cuban independent journalists, human rights activists, independent political parties, trade unions, and other organizations. Freedom House is solely responsible for the objectives and planning of the project and for its administration. Freedom House has also given Cuba the lowest rating in its: ‚ÄúFreedom in the World 2005‚Äù report for political rights, and the lowest rating in its ‚Äúelectoral democracy‚Äù category. The Freedom House 2005 report states: ‚ÄúCubans cannot change their government through democratic means. Fidel Castro dominates the political system, having transformed the country into a one- party state with the Cuban Communist Party (PCC) controlling all governmental entities from the national to the local level. Castro is responsible for every appointment and controls every lever of power in Cuba in his various roles as president of the Council of Ministers, chairman of the Council of State, commander in chief of the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR), and first secretary of the PCC. In October 2002, some eight million Cubans voted in tightly controlled municipal elections. On January 19, 2003, an election was held for the Cuban National Assembly, with just 609 candidates - all supported by the regime - vying for 609 seats. All political organizing outside the PCC is illegal. Political dissent, spoken or written, is a punishable offense, and those so punished frequently receive years of imprisonment for seemingly minor infractions.‚Äù In 2002 former U.S. President Jimmy Carter spoke in Havana with support from Human Rights Watch and representing the Carter Center. Whilst calling for democratic change, Carter also stressed that he was not using a U.S. definition of ‚Äúdemocracy.‚Äù he explained that ‚Äúthe term is embedded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Cuba signed in 1948. It is based on some simple premises: all citizens are born with the right to choose their own leaders, to define their own destiny, to speak freely, to organize political parties, trade unions and non-governmental groups, and to have fair and open trials.‚Äù The 2006 report from Human Rights Watch states: ‚ÄúCuba remains a Latin American anomaly: an undemocratic government that represses nearly all forms of political dissent. President Fidel Castro, now in his forty-seventh year in power, shows no willingness to consider even minor reforms. Instead, his government continues to enforce political conformity using criminal prosecutions, long- and short-term detentions, mob harassment, police warnings, surveillance, house arrests, travel restrictions, and motivated dismissals from employment. The end result is that Cubans are systematically denied basic rights to free expression, association, assembly, privacy, movement, and due process of law.‚Äù Human Rights defenders in Cuba from Human Rights First states: ‚ÄúCuba remains the only country in the Western Hemisphere to reject democracy and effectively outlaw peaceful advocacy for human rights and democratic reforms. Independent civil society in Cuba ‚Äì including human rights defenders, democracy activists, and independent journalists and scholars ‚Äì are the targets of constant persecution. The recognized rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly are systematically violated by the State and victims have virtually no means of redress within the judicial system.‚Äù Cuba's supporters argue that the Cuban system is more democratic than that used in multi-party democracies. The Cuba Solidarity Campaign, a group based in the United States, says: ‚ÄúElectoral candidates are not chosen by small committees of political parties‚Ä¶ Instead the candidates are nominated individually by grass-roots organisations and by individual electors‚Ä¶ The successful candidate is chosen by secret ballot. The Electoral Law of 1992 stipulates that delegates to the municipal and provincial assemblies and the 601 deputies to the National Assembly are all elected by popular suffrage using a secret ballot‚Ä¶ Unlike the case in other states, which invariably criticize Cuba for being ‚Äòundemocratic‚Äô, voter turn- out in Cuba is high. In April 2005, 97.7% of electors came out to vote for their deputies to the municipal assemblies.‚Äù === Political figures === Many other notable political figures have commented on Cuba and democracy. At a conference held by the International Committee for Democracy in Cuba called ‚ÄúTowards democracy in Cuba‚Äù, former Czech leader V√°clav Havel stated, ‚Äúdemocracy and prosperity in Cuba depend on the support for Cuban dissidents, the better the chances for a future peaceful transition of the Cuban society to democracy.‚Äù Havel has also described Cuba as ‚Äúthe biggest prison on earth‚Äù. In 2006 Peruvian Presidential candidate and Bolivarian Ollanta Humala stated that ‚ÄúObviously, according to our standards Cuba does not qualify as a democracy,‚Äù but added that Peru ‚Äúis democratic, we have democratized poverty‚Äù. === Political writers and academics === Groups or individuals that describe Cuba is a ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù or claim that there is some level of democracy in the political system generally focus on community participation at local municipal level. For example, Cuban Teresita Jorge writes that democracy in Cuba ‚Äútakes place from the grassroots up in the selection of those who will represent the people at all the levels of government‚Äú. Similarly, Political scientists Haroldo Dilla Alfonso and Gerardo Gonz√°lez N√∫√±ez study what they describe as Cuba's ‚Äúcommunity power and grassroots democracy‚Äù. They write that ‚Äúthis participatory system contained an interesting combination of direct democracy and the use of representation as granted by election. In general, it attempted to provide citizens with the ability to choose the local leadership, express claims, oversee and evaluate local policy and its results, and become involved in projects of community benefit.‚Äù The pair concluded that ‚Äúwe ought to consider Municipal Assemblies as a remarkable step forward in building democracy‚Äù. American political scientist Peter Roman's work on the subject led him to believe that Cuba's ‚Äúgrassroots democracy‚Äù goes beyond the power to vote freely for one of several candidates representing both pro or anti- socialist positions. He argues that at the ‚Äúpeople level‚Äù democracy exists in Cuba today and that this democracy has been strengthened during the 1990s by conscious decisions made at the top. Roman also writes that the historical origins of contemporary Cuban democracy are the ideas of the centrality of unity and consensus, and the rejection of a distinction between political and civil society. Thus, unanimous votes in representative bodies do not represent, as critics charge, imposition by the PCC, but rather legitimate consensus worked out in lengthy discussion at several levels. British political professor Steve Ludlum wrote in his paper ‚ÄúParticipation is key to Cuba‚Äôs democracy‚Äù that ‚ÄúTwo models of democracy competed for support in nineteenth century Europe. The one we know is based on indirect representation by professional politicians controlled by party factions. The other model, associated with Rousseau‚Äôs concept of the ‚Äògeneral will‚Äô and made famous by the Paris Commune of 1870‚Äù. Ludlum likens Cuba's local participation to the latter model. William M. LeoGrande, in a paper written for the Cuba Transition Project at the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami, wrote of the 1992 election law: \\"unprecedented openness in debate, not just among party members, but also among the entire populace, so as to foster greater participation and build 'the necessary consensus' for the government's policy response...Eventually, some three million people participated in the pre-Congress discussions\\", but \\"When the new electoral law was finalized‚Ä¶ it dashed any hopes for a significant opening to alternative voices. The ban on campaigning was retained, and the nomination of provincial and national assembly candidates was entrusted to Candidacy Commissions. Through an elaborate process of consultation‚Ä¶ the Candidacy Commissions‚Ä¶ produced slates of nominees with just one candidate per seat. Voters only had the choice of voting yes or no. Thus, the election process at the provincial and national levels avoided the possibility of even implicit policy differences among candidates.‚ÄùWilliam M. Leogrande Paper In a detailed study of the 1997-1998 elections, it was argued that there were multiple candidates in the open nomination assemblies held for the nomination of these candidates for these seats.August, A.

The village is famous for being the site of Hokkaido's only nuclear power plant, the Tomari Nuclear Power Plant. Its first reactor became operational in 1989, and its second in 1991. Tax revenue from the nuclear power plant has ensured that Tomari's local government, unlike most rural villages, operates at a consistent surplus. ==History== Historically, the Kayanuma area of the village was a coal mining town. The town was first settled by the Japanese in 1601, and was incorporated as a village in 1880.

After failing several entrance tests for higher-education schools and working as a draughtsman for a while, he went on to become a journalist. One of his first articles was an obituary of Darwin.Barrett H. Clark, Contemporary French Dramatists page 139 He went on to write humorous pieces for papers such as Gaulois, L'√âcho de Paris and L'Illustration. He also wrote for Le Figaro, under the penname of Graindorge. In 1914, he became the editor of Figaro. During the First World War he wrote stridently patriotic pieces. On 12 February 1914, he became a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. ==Work and themes== In 1878, in collaboration with L. Vonoven, he published a volume of short stories; the next year the two produced a one-act piece, Le Mari malgre lui, at the Th√©√¢tre Cluny. This cites √âdouard Quet, Alfred Capus (1904), with appreciations by various authors, in the series of C√©l√©brit√©s d'aujourd'hui. His novels, Qui perd gagne (1890), Faux Depart (1891), Ann√©e des d'aventures (1895), describe the struggles of three young men at the beginning of their career. From the first of these he took his first comedy, Brignol et sa fille (Vaudeville, November 23, 1894). The German film Leontine's Husbands, released in 1928 and starring Claire Rommer, Georg Alexander, Adele Sandrock and Truus van Aalten, was adapted from Capus' 1900 comedy Les Maris de Leontine. ==Bibliography== ===Plays=== *' (1896), written with Alphonse Allais *' (1897) *' (1897) *' (1898) *' (1900) *' (1900) *' (1901) *' (1901) (the basis of the 1921 com√©die musicale La petite fonctionnaire) *' (1902) *' (1902) *' (1903), with Emmanuel Ar√®ne, which was produced in London by George Alexander as The Man of the Moment *' (1904), the first of his plays to be performed at the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais *' (1905) *' (1906), written with Lucien Descaves ===Novels=== *' (1890) *' (1891) *' (1910) ==References== Category:1858 births Category:1922 deaths Category:People from Aix-en-Provence Category:19th- century French novelists Category:20th-century French novelists Category:20th- century French male writers Category:Members of the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise Category:Commandeurs of the L√©gion d'honneur Category:Burials at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery Category:French male novelists Category:19th-century French male writers ","title":"Alfred Capus"},{"id":"1435454","text":"is a town located in Shiribeshi Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan.

It was launched by artists who had seceded from its rival Puck. The founders included cartoonist James Albert Wales, dime novels publisher Frank Tousey and author George H. Jessop. ==History and profile== Cover of 4 Oct 1924 issue The first printing of Judge was on October 29, 1881, during the Long Depression. It was 16 pages long and printed on quarto paper. While it did well initially, it soon had trouble competing with Puck. William J. Arkell purchased the magazine in the middle 1880s. Arkell used his considerable wealth to persuade the cartoonists Eugene Zimmerman (\\"Zim\\") and Bernhard Gillam to leave Puck. A supporter of the Republican Party, Arkell persuaded his cartoonists to attack the Democratic administration of Grover Cleveland. With G.O.P. aid, Judge boomed during the '80s and '90s, surpassing its rival publication in content and circulation. By the early 1890s, the circulation of the magazine reached 50,000. Under the editorial leadership of Isaac Gregory, (1886‚Äì1901), Judge allied with the Republican Party and supported the candidacy of William McKinley largely through the cartoons of cartoonists Victor Gillam and Grant E. Hamilton. Circulation for Judge was about 85,000 in the 1890s. By the 1900s, the magazine had become successful, reaching a circulation of 100,000 by 1912. Edward Anthony was an editor in the early 1920s. Anthony was later co-author of Frank Buck's first two books, Bring 'em Back Alive and Wild Cargo. Harold Ross was an editor of Judge between April 5 and August 2, 1924. He used the experience on the magazine to start his own in 1925, The New Yorker.Yagoda, Ben (2000). About Town: The New Yorker and the World It Made. Scribner. pp. 34‚Äì35. . The success of The New Yorker, as well as the depression, put pressure on the magazine. It became a monthly in 1932 and ceased circulation in 1947. Judge was resurrected in October 1953 as a 32-page weekly. David N. Laux was President and Publisher with Mabel Search as editorial director and Al Catalano as art director. Contributors included Arthur L. Lippman and Victor Lasky. There were sections with light essays on sport, golf, horse racing, radio, theater, television, bridge and current books, along with submissions from college magazines, a crossword puzzle, single-panel cartoons and humorous pieces. There were several political sections; one-liners, cartoons and longer essays with mostly a conservative bent, in a style foreshadowing Emmett Tyrrell of today's The American Spectator.

He is one of the most influential Serbian lyricists and modernist poets. Duƒçiƒá published his first collection of poetry in Mostar in 1901 and his second in Belgrade in 1908. He also wrote often in prose, writing a number of literary essays, studies on writers, letters by poets from Switzerland, Greece and Spain and the book Blago cara Radovana for which he is most remembered when it comes to his writing. Duƒçiƒá was also one of the founders of the Narodna Odbrana, a nationalist non-governmental organization in the Kingdom of Serbia and he was a member of the Serbian Royal Academy. ==Biography== ===Early life and diplomacy=== Jovan Duƒçiƒá was born on 17 February 1871 in Trebinje, at the time part of Bosnia Vilayet within the Ottoman Empire. In Trebinje he attended primary school. He moved on to a high school in Mostar and trained to become a teacher in Sombor. He worked as a teacher in several towns before returning to Mostar, where he founded (with writer Svetozar ƒÜoroviƒá and poet Aleksa ≈†antiƒá) a literary magazine called Zora (Dawn). Duƒçiƒá's openly expressed Serbian patriotism caused difficulties with the authorities ‚Äì at that time Bosnia and Herzegovina was de facto incorporated into the Austro-Hungarian Empire ‚Äì and he moved abroad to pursue higher studies, mostly in Geneva and Paris. He was awarded a law degree by the University of Geneva and, following his return from abroad, entered Serbian diplomatic service in 1907. Although he had previously expressed opposition to the idea of creating a Yugoslavia, he became the new country's first ambassador to Romania (in 1937). He had a distinguished diplomatic career in this capacity, serving in Istanbul, Sofia, Rome, Athens, Cairo, Madrid and Lisbon. Duƒçiƒá spoke several foreign languages and he is remembered as a distinguished diplomat. ===Poetry=== Duƒçiƒá (left) with fellow Serbian poet- diplomat Milan Rakiƒá It was as a poet that Duƒçiƒá gained his greatest distinctions. He published his first book of poetry in Mostar in 1901 and his second in Belgrade, 1908. He wrote prose as well: several essays and studies about writers, Blago cara Radovana (Tsar Radovan's treasure) and poetry letters from Switzerland, Greece, Spain and other countries. Like ≈†antiƒá, Duƒçiƒá's work was initially heavily influenced by that of Vojislav Iliƒá, the leading Serbian poet of the late 19th century. His travels abroad helped him to develop his own individual style, in which the Symbolist movement was perhaps the greatest single influence. In his poetry he explored quite new territory that was previously unknown in Serbian poetry. He restricted himself to only two verse styles, the symmetrical dodecasyllable (the Alexandrine) and hendecasyllable‚Äîboth French in origin‚Äîin order to focus on the symbolic meaning of his work. He expressed a double fear, of vulgarity of thought, and vulgarity of expression. ===Personal life=== In the autumn of 1893, during the party in the newly built hotel Drina in Bijeljina, a young and ambitious teacher Duƒçiƒá met recent School of Commerce graduate Magdalena ≈Ωivanoviƒá. They got engaged with on 5 November 1893, and their correspondence continued even Duƒçiƒá's departure from Bijeljina to Mostar to teach from 1895 to 1899. A part of the correspondence is kept safe up to this day, as well as the letter which Duƒçiƒá's friend and poet Aleksa ≈†antiƒá redirected to Magdalena on 6 April 1901. year asking for help in collecting a subscription for his songs. Ljiljana Lukiƒá, a retired professor, keeps a personal copy of the correspondence between Duƒçiƒá and Magdalena. Professor Ljiljana Lukiƒá states that Duƒçiƒá lived for a short time in the house of Magdalena Nikoliƒá who lived with her sister. After break up with Duƒçiƒá, Magdalena shouted that she would never leave home again. \\"Like a novel heroine, she lived by her memories and the only happy moments she had was in reading the letters and songs of the man she loved\\", as Professor Lukiƒá concludes. Duƒçiƒá's secret fianc√© left in the amanet the following words to be written after her death on the monument, which are still read today on the Bijeljina graveyard: Maga Nikoliƒá-≈Ωivanoviƒá, 1874‚Äì1957, the poet herself and first inspiration of poet Jovan Duƒçiƒá. Twenty years before Magdalena's death, while Duƒçiƒá was the authorized minister of Kingdom of Yugoslavia, a request was received that testifies of the deep trace which Duƒçiƒá left in Bijeljina. Singing society Srbadija asked the minister to help in building a home for the needs of society. The Embassy of Serbia in Hungary is in the house which Jovan Duƒçiƒá received from a Hungarian woman, and then donated it to the state. ===Exile, death and legacy=== Statue of Duƒçiƒá in Trebinje Duƒçiƒá's grave site in the Hercegovaƒçka Graƒçanica monastery in Trebinje Duƒçiƒá went into exile in the United States in 1941 following the German invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia, where he joined his relative Mihajlo (Michael) in Gary, Indiana. From then until his death two years later, he led a Chicago-based organization, the Serbian National Defense Council (founded by Mihailo Pupin in 1914) which represented the Serbian diaspora in the US. During these two years, he wrote many poems, historical books and newspaper articles espousing Serbian nationalist causes and protesting the mass murder of Serbs by the pro-Nazi Usta≈°e regime of Croatia. In Yugoslav school anthologies immediately after WWII he had been declared persona non grata and widely viewed as a Serbian chauvinist Lenard J. Cohen, Jasna Dragovic-Soso; (2007) State Collapse in South-Eastern Europe: New Perspectives on Yugoslavia's Disintegration p. 211; Purdue University Press, He died on 7 April 1943. His funeral took place at the Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church in Gary, Indiana and he was buried in the Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Monastery cemetery in Libertyville, Illinois. He expressed a wish in his will to be buried in his home town of Trebinje, a goal which was finally realized when he was reburied there on 22 October 2000 in the newly built Hercegovaƒçka Graƒçanica monastery. His Acta Diplomatica (Diplomatic Letters) was published posthumously in the United States (in 1952) and in the former-Yugoslavia (in 1991). The Jovan Duƒçiƒá Award is awarded for achievements in poetry and it is awarded every year during the manifestation \\"Duƒçiƒá's Night\\" in Trebinje. He was elected a member of Parnassos Literary Society. ==Works== * Pjesme, knjiga prva, izdanje uredni≈°tva Zore u Mostaru, 1901. * Pesme, Srpska knji≈æevna zadruga, Kolo XVII, knj. 113.

These laws describe the inheritance of traits linked to single genes on chromosomes in the nucleus. In Mendelian inheritance, each parent contributes one of two possible alleles for a trait. If the genotypes of both parents in a genetic cross are known, Mendel's laws can be used to determine the distribution of phenotypes expected for the population of offspring. There are several situations in which the proportions of phenotypes observed in the progeny do not match the predicted values. Non-Mendelian inheritance plays a role in several disease processes. ==Types== ===Incomplete dominance=== In cases of intermediate inheritance due to incomplete dominance, the principle of dominance discovered by Mendel does not apply. Nevertheless, the principle of uniformity works, as all offspring in the F1-generation have the same genotype and same phenotype. Mendel's principle of segregation of genes applies too, as in the F2-generation homozygous individuals with the phenotypes of the P-generation appear. Intermediate inheritance was first examined by Carl Correns in Mirabilis jalapa he used for further genetic experiments.Biology University of Hamburg: Mendelian Genetics Antirrhinum majus also shows intermediate inheritance of the pigmentation of the blossoms.Neil A. Campbell, Jane B. Reece: Biologie. Spektrum-Verlag Heidelberg-Berlin 2003, , page 302. ===Co-dominance=== Co-dominante expression of genes for plumage colours. In cases of co-dominance, the genetic traits of both different alleles of the same gene-locus are clearly expressed in the phenotype. For example, in certain varieties of chicken, the allele for black feathers is co-dominant with the allele for white feathers. Heterozygous chickens have a colour described as \\"erminette\\", speckled with black and white feathers appearing separately. Many human genes, including one for a protein that controls cholesterol levels in the blood, show co-dominance too. People with the heterozygous form of this gene produce two different forms of the protein, each with a different effect on cholesterol levels. ===Genetic linkage=== When genes are located on the same chromosome and no crossing over took place before the segregation of the chromosomes into the gametes, the genetic traits will be inherited in connection, because of the genetic linkage. These cases constitute an exception to the Mendelian rule of independent assortment. ===Multiple alleles=== In Mendelian inheritance, genes have only two alleles, such as a and A. Mendel consciously chose pairs of genetic traits, represented by two alleles for his inheritance experiments. In nature, such genes often exist in several different forms and are therefore said to have multiple alleles. An individual, of course, usually has only two copies of each gene, but many different alleles are often found within a population. A rabbit's coat color is determined by a single gene that has at least four different alleles. They display a pattern of a dominance-hierarchy that can produce four coat colors. In the genes for the dog coat colours there are four alleles on the Agouti-locus. The allele \\"aw\\" is dominant over the alleles \\"at\\" and \\"a\\" but recessive under \\"Ay\\". Many other genes have multiple alleles, including the human genes for ABO blood type. ===Epistasis=== In the genepool of cats (Felis silvestris catus) there is a recessive allele for orange coat on the X-Chromosome. In a male the Y-Chromosome cannot compensate this, so a hemizygous tomcat is born orange. This allele is epistatic over some other coat color genes.Schmidt-K√ºntzel, Nelson G. David et. al.: A domestic cat X chromosome linkage map and the sex-linked orange locus: mapping of orange, multiple origins and epistasis over nonagouti.Le g√®ne Orange chez le chat : g√©notype et ph√©notype A heterozygous cat with kittens from an orange tomcat: 50 % are orange, 50 % can produce eumelanin. Here the segregation of her two alleles, one dominant for the ability to produce eumelanin, one recessive for orange, was crucial for the colour of the kittens. With the young males it is decisive which of the two X-Chromosomes they received from the mother, because the Y-Chromosome does not contain a corresponding allele from the father. In the young females it is also decisive which X-Chromosome they got from the mother, because the allele for orange is recessive, so that only homozygotes become orange. If one or more genes cannot be expressed because of another genetic factor hindering their expression, this epistasis can make it impossible even for dominant alleles on certain other gene-loci to have an effect on the phenotype. An example in dog coat genetics is the homozygosity with the allele \\"e e\\" on the Extension-locus making it impossible to produce any other pigment than pheomelanin. Although the allele \\"e\\" is a recessive allele on the extension-locus itself, the presence of two copies leverages the dominance of other coat colour genes. Domestic cats have a gene with a similar effect on the X-chromosome. ===Sex-linked inheritance=== Genetic traits located on gonosomes sometimes show specific non-Mendelian inheritance patterns. Individuals can develop a recessive trait in the phenotype dependent on their sex‚Äîfor example, colour blindness and haemophilia (see gonosomal inheritances).Joseph Schacherer: Beyond the simplicity of Mendelian inheritance Science Direct 2016Khan Academy: Variations on Mendel's laws (overview) As many of the alleles are dominant or recessive, a true understanding of the principles of Mendelian inheritance is an important requirement to also understand the more complicated inheritance patterns of sex-linked inheritances. === Extranuclear inheritance === Example of a pedigree for a genetic trait inherited by mitochondrial DNA in animals and humans. Offspring of the males with the trait don't inherit the trait. Offspring of the females with the trait always inherit the trait (independently from their own sex). Extranuclear inheritance (also known as cytoplasmic inheritance) is a form of non-Mendelian inheritance also first discovered by Carl Correns in 1908. While working with Mirabilis jalapa, Correns observed that leaf colour was dependent only on the genotype of the maternal parent. Based on these data, he determined that the trait was transmitted through a character present in the cytoplasm of the ovule. Later research by Ruth Sager and others identified DNA present in chloroplasts as being responsible for the unusual inheritance pattern observed. Work on the poky strain of the mould Neurospora crassa begun by Mary and Hershel Mitchell ultimately led to the discovery of genetic material in the mitochondria, the mitochondrial DNA. According to the endosymbiont theory, mitochondria and chloroplasts were once free-living organisms that were each taken up by a eukaryotic cell. Over time, mitochondria and chloroplasts formed a symbiotic relationship with their eukaryotic hosts. Although the transfer of a number of genes from these organelles to the nucleus prevents them from living independently, each still possesses genetic material in the form of double stranded DNA. It is the transmission of this organellar DNA that is responsible for the phenomenon of extranuclear inheritance. Both chloroplasts and mitochondria are present in the cytoplasm of maternal gametes only. Paternal gametes (sperm for example) do not have cytoplasmic mitochondria. Thus, the phenotype of traits linked to genes found in either chloroplasts or mitochondria are determined exclusively by the maternal parent. In humans, mitochondrial diseases are a class of diseases, many of which affect the muscles and the eye. ===Polygenic traits=== Many traits are produced by the interaction of several genes. Traits controlled by two or more genes are said to be polygenic traits. Polygenic means \\"many genes\\" are necessary for the organism to develop the trait. For example, at least three genes are involved in making the reddish-brown pigment in the eyes of fruit flies. Polygenic traits often show a wide range of phenotypes. The broad variety of skin colour in humans comes about partly because at least four different genes probably control this trait. === Gene conversion === Gene conversion can be one of the major forms of non-Mendelian inheritance. Gene conversion arises during DNA repair via DNA recombination, by which a piece of DNA sequence information is transferred from one DNA helix (which remains unchanged) to another DNA helix, whose sequence is altered. This may occur as a mismatch repair between the strands of DNA which are derived from different parents. Thus the mismatch repair can convert one allele into the other. This phenomenon can be detected through the offspring non-Mendelian ratios, and is frequently observed, e.g., in fungal crosses.Stacey K. A. (1994). Recombination. In: Kendrew John, Lawrence Eleanor (eds. === Infectious heredity === Another form of non- Mendelian inheritance is known as infectious heredity. Infectious particles such as viruses may infect host cells and continue to reside in the cytoplasm of these cells. If the presence of these particles results in an altered phenotype, then this phenotype may be subsequently transmitted to progeny. Because this phenotype is dependent only on the presence of the invader in the host cell's cytoplasm, inheritance will be determined only by the infected status of the maternal parent. This will result in a uniparental transmission of the trait, just as in extranuclear inheritance. One of the most well- studied examples of infectious heredity is the killer phenomenon exhibited in yeast. Two double-stranded RNA viruses, designated L and M, are responsible for this phenotype. The L virus codes for the capsid proteins of both viruses, as well as an RNA polymerase. Thus the M virus can only infect cells already harbouring L virus particles. The M viral RNA encodes a toxin that is secreted from the host cell. It kills susceptible cells growing in close proximity to the host. The M viral RNA also renders the host cell immune to the lethal effects of the toxin. For a cell to be susceptible it must therefore be either uninfected or harbour only the L virus. The L and M viruses are not capable of exiting their host cell through conventional means. They can only transfer from cell to cell when their host undergoes mating. All progeny of a mating involving a doubly infected yeast cell will also be infected with the L and M viruses. Therefore, the killer phenotype will be passed down to all progeny. Heritable traits that result from infection with foreign particles have also been identified in Drosophila. Wild-type flies normally fully recover after being anesthetized with carbon dioxide. Certain lines of flies have been identified that die off after exposure to the compound. This carbon dioxide sensitivity is passed down from mothers to their progeny. This sensitivity is due to infection with œÉ (Sigma) virus, a rhabdovirus only capable of infecting Drosophila. Although this process is usually associated with viruses, recent research has shown that the Wolbachia bacterium is also capable of inserting its genome into that of its host. === Genomic imprinting === Genomic imprinting represents yet another example of non-Mendelian inheritance. Just as in conventional inheritance, genes for a given trait are passed down to progeny from both parents. However, these genes are epigenetically marked before transmission, altering their levels of expression. These imprints are created before gamete formation and are erased during the creation of germ line cells. Therefore, a new pattern of imprinting can be made with each generation. Genes are imprinted differently depending on the parental origin of the chromosome that contains them. In mice, the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene undergoes imprinting. The protein encoded by this gene helps to regulate body size. Mice that possess two functional copies of this gene are larger than those with two mutant copies. The size of mice that are heterozygous at this locus depends on the parent from which the wild-type allele came. If the functional allele originated from the mother, the offspring will exhibit dwarfism, whereas a paternal allele will generate a normal-sized mouse. This is because the maternal Igf2 gene is imprinted. Imprinting results in the inactivation of the Igf2 gene on the chromosome passed down by the mother. Imprints are formed due to the differential methylation of paternal and maternal alleles. This results in differing expression between alleles from the two parents. Sites with significant methylation are associated with low levels of gene expression. Higher gene expression is found at unmethylated sites. In this mode of inheritance, phenotype is determined not only by the specific allele transmitted to the offspring, but also by the sex of the parent that transmitted it. ===Mosaicism=== Individuals who possess cells with genetic differences from the other cells in their body are termed mosaics. These differences can result from mutations that occur in different tissues and at different periods of development. If a mutation happens in the non-gamete forming tissues, it is characterized as somatic. Germline mutations occur in the egg or sperm cells and can be passed on to offspring. Mutations that occur early on in development will affect a greater number of cells and can result in an individual that can be identified as a mosaic strictly based on phenotype. Mosaicism also results from a phenomenon known as X-inactivation. All female mammals have two X chromosomes. To prevent lethal gene dosage problems, one of these chromosomes is inactivated following fertilization. This process occurs randomly for all of the cells in the organism's body. Because a given female's two X chromosomes will almost certainly differ in their specific pattern of alleles, this will result in differing cell phenotypes depending on which chromosome is silenced. Calico cats, which are almost all female, demonstrate one of the most commonly observed manifestations of this process. ===Trinucleotide repeat disorders=== Trinucleotide repeat disorders also follow a non-Mendelian pattern of inheritance. These diseases are all caused by the expansion of microsatellite tandem repeats consisting of a stretch of three nucleotides. Typically in individuals, the number of repeated units is relatively low. With each successive generation, there is a chance that the number of repeats will expand. As this occurs, progeny can progress to premutation and ultimately affected status. Individuals with a number of repeats that falls in the premutation range have a good chance of having affected children. Those who progress to affected status will exhibit symptoms of their particular disease. Prominent trinucleotide repeat disorders include Fragile X syndrome and Huntington's disease. In the case of Fragile X syndrome it is thought that the symptoms result from the increased methylation and accompanying reduced expression of the fragile X mental retardation gene in individuals with a sufficient number of repeats. ==See also== *Meiotic drive *CoRR Hypothesis *Epigenetic inheritance *Gene drive *Intragenomic conflict ==References== ==External links== * non-Mendelian inheritance at Duke University Category:Extended evolutionary synthesis Category:Classical genetics ","title":"Non-Mendelian inheritance"},{"id":"1435554","text":"Roy Stuart is an American photographer and film director\\"Roy Stuart cliches x\\", Lib√©ration.

Full color flyer from 1977 The original Squad Leader was produced in time to debut at Origins 1977. (The original print run of 2,500 copies had purple boxes which have become collectors' items.) Avalon Hill sold well in excess of 100,000 games of Squad Leader, making it one of the most successful war games ever made.Wargames Handbook: How to Play and Design Commercial and Professional Wargames, by James F. Dunnigan, iUniverse; 3 edition (January 3, 2000), p.198 Combined with the sales of Advanced Squad Leader, its sales totaled over 1 million copies by 1997. ==Gameplay== Pieces in Squad Leader represent regular squads (rated for firepower, range and morale), weapon and vehicle crews, elite squads (with high firepower and morale but shorter range - used to represent paratroops or combat engineers armed with sub-machine guns), individual leaders, support weapons, and vehicles. The original game contains counters representing the German, Russian and American armies. Russian troops are portrayed as poorly armed (and with poor quality radios, making it very difficult for them to summon artillery support) and with relatively fewer leaders, but with the capacity to become \\"berserk\\" in combat (a capacity shared in later expansions by SS troops). US troops are shown as having unusually high firepower (representing larger squads, using the Browning Automatic Rifle - unlike other nationalities who have separate counters for light machine guns), but with slightly lower base morale than German or Soviet troops, representing the supposed greater tendency of more individualistic Americans to break from their orders or the group under fire - however, American troops are easier to rally under fire, as they were exempt from the usual penalty (\\"desperation morale\\") paid by broken squads in these circumstances. British troops, when eventually added to the game system, are shown as largely similar to the Germans, albeit with somewhat inferior equipment. The mapboards are divided into hexagonal grids with each hex said to represent 40 metres of terrain, the result of the designer being asked what the ground scale was, rolling a die and it coming up 'four'. In reality, European village streets are not 40 meters across, for example. Time was said to be two minutes per turn, though the developer admits that this is also inexact and that each game turn should be considered a \\"module of time, such that the (game's) events can occur and interact with one another.\\"Squad Leader Rulebook, Designer's Notes (p. 32 in the Fourth Edition rules). As well, by being geomorphic mapboards, increased flexibility is given to scenario designers as well as \\"design your own\\" players. The semi-simultaneous system of play developed in the mid-1970s can be seen in Squad Leader's sequence of play. Each turn consists of two player turns, each of which have eight \\"phases\\": * Rally phase (in which \\"broken\\" units attempt to rally and malfunctioning weapons are repaired) * Prep fire phase (in which the player whose turn it is may fire on enemy units; any units that prep fire cannot move or fire again for the rest of the player's turn) * Movement phase (in which the player may move their units on the board) * Defensive fire phase (in which the other player may fire on units that just moved) * Advancing fire phase (in which any units that moved may fire, at reduced strength) * Rout phase (in which any \\"broken\\" units must flee for cover) * Advance phase (in which the player whose turn it is may move every unit one hex), and the close combat phase (in which any units from opposite sides that start that phase in the same hex engage in close combat) The name of the game is actually a misnomer, as in most ways the player assumes the role of a company commander (i.e. gives orders to platoons and squads). The squad leaders in Squad Leader are actually \\"factored in\\" to the squad counters, and only exceptional leaders - officers and NCOs - are portrayed separately, by their own counters. Leaders can exert a favorable influence on the firing of support weapons, or the morale rolls of squads with whom they are stacked, although if a leader fails a morale check the squads stacked with it must check for morale a second time. Most scenarios give each player, generally speaking, enough simulated men to make up a company, though order of battle is not precise and most scenarios only give a flavor of what the real life battles were like rather than a direct simulation. One aspect of the game that adds greatly to its popularity are the generic \\"geomorphic\\" mapboards, each of which can be aligned to any edge of the same length to any other mapboard (except river boards). This allows for an almost unlimited number of combinations to create any terrain situation, including player designed scenarios. Printed overlays, first introduced in the gamette GI: Anvil of Victory, also provide additional terrain types to mapboards. Line of sight (LOS) is determined by sighting between the dots in the center of each hex. String can be used to check LOS, and the printed terrain depictions on the photo-realistic maps are used to determine blockages (hexes are not considered automatically filled by terrain therein). These LOS rules were innovative for board games when introduced in the 1970s. The original game contains mapboards mounted on heavy durable cardboard, which was (and remains) expensive but a design feature long associated with Avalon Hill games. Each mapboard measures 10 columns of hexes high by 32 hexes wide, numbered from hex A1 in the top left corner to hex GG10 in the lower right. { class=\\" floatright\\" -  Board 1  Urban terrain -  Board 2 Hill terrain -  Board 3 Village terrain -  Board 4 Rural terrain - colspan=2Scenarios: 1-12 } The design philosophy that John Hill brought to Squad Leader was \\"design for effect\\". He hypothesized that no matter what kind of fire might be brought on a squad of infantry, be it a flame weapon, a grenade, a machine gun, or an artillery shell, there could only be three outcomes; the squad would be eliminated by killing or wounding the men in it; the squad would be \\"discomfited\\" to some degree (i.e. they must check for morale - if they fail they run for cover until rallied by a leader, and if they fail a second morale roll while \\"broken\\" the counter is removed as the men are assumed to have run away); or there would be no effect. Using this principle, he was able to employ a single table to create combat results of the various weapons systems used in the game. A similar principle is employed in dealing with support weapons - rolling a certain number might cause a weapon (e.g. a machine gun) to be put out of action, after which a player must roll again each turn until the weapon is either restored to use or lost altogether; there is no need to determine whether the weapon was broken, jammed, or was simply reloading with fresh ammunition. Squad Leader is a game system by design rather than just one game. The game itself comes with 12 different scenarios, each one introducing more complicated rules in a system called \\"programmed instruction\\". Each scenario card includes historical information, victory conditions and play balancers for each side. However, Squad Leader also has a \\"design your own\\" system where forces are selected by drawing playing cards from a standard 52 card deck and comparing the result to a table where different forces were described. There is also a point purchase system for \\"buying\\" opposing forces. New scenarios were published in Avalon Hill's gaming magazine, The General, as well as additional scenario packs (the rogue scenarios, for example, see below). Third parties also produced scores of SL scenarios. ==Strengths== Squad Leader attempted to simulate many types of battlefield phenomena not addressed before in a tactical board game, and enjoyed a cosmetic treatment unmatched then and afterwards. Some of these strengths include: * The effects of leadership on morale is elegantly handled, with extraordinary leaders (only) having direct effects on the ability of men to move, shoot, and resist enemy attack. * The rigid turn sequences of war games up to that point in time was dispensed with in favor of the innovative eight-phase turns described above. Units can interact with enemy units during the other player's turn. * The game, as explained by John Hill's designer's notes, encourages players to learn and adopt basic infantry tactics - defenders are encouraged to site machine guns to dominate fields of fire, while attackers are encouraged to have some men give covering fire while others moved. * Some support weapons can fire multiple times in a phase, and machine guns have the ability (\\"penetration\\") to inflict damage through a line of several adjacent hexes - two hexes for a light machine gun, and six or even eight for a heavy machine gun. * The system is flexible and open-ended; the geomorphic boards can represent reasonably well many types of terrain, and the use of \\"scenario special rules\\" expand these possibilities even further. Victory conditions are also flexible and imaginative, not being confined to mere shootouts between opposing forces, scenarios could simulate all manners of military missions (especially in the follow-up modules), such as successfully escorting convoys, parachute and glider assaults, a deliberate assault on prepared positions, an ambush, a meeting engagement, a hasty attack/defence scenario, a passage of obstacles, a withdrawal under fire, and even such things as hostage situations. Missions that real life company commanders would have faced and performed. * The quality of the physical components has rarely been equalled by other games; counters are functional, evocative, well designed (free of clutter), and attractive. Especially popular are the red \\"berserk\\" counters which add much flavor to the game; Cross of Iron adds striking white-on-black counters to represent the Waffen SS. The mounted mapboards (both in Squad Leader and its offspring) are a hallmark of Avalon Hill, and continued right through to the introduction of the ASL Starter Kits by Multi-Man Publishing in 2004 (which featured mapboards printed on inexpensive cardboard stock). The mapboards are also photo-realistic, with an attractive top down view that is also functional, with line of sight (LOS) drawn from hex center to hex center and blocked only by terrain depictions (often with accompanying shadows) on the artwork itself, not the entire hex as in other games. ==Weaknesses== Some of the weaknesses that keep Squad Leader from being a true simulation of the decisions that a World War II commander would make are well known and attempts have been made to address them; others were simply ignored for the sake of \\"playability\\". Some of these include the following: * Despite some rules for \\"concealment\\" and \\"hidden initial placement\\", most of the game is played where each player can always see what forces the enemy has and precisely where they are placed, even if out of LOS of their own units. There is little \\"fog of war.\\" Attempts to address this - some have suggested using multiple copies of the game and a third party to act as \\"umpire\\" - are cumbersome and in some cases book-keeping intensive. * Play is not simultaneous but done in predictable turn sequence, one player getting a turn, and then the other. An attempt to address this was the use of \\"track\\" counters introduced in the first section of the rulebook, and the optional rule of \\"semi-simultaneous movement and defensive fire\\" which later became standardized in Advanced Squad Leader. * There are no partial casualties to either men or vehicles. Squads are considered to be at full strength until destroyed, and vehicles suffer no damage aside from weapons malfunctions or immobilizations; partial penetrations, panicked crews, and other battlefield phenomena are not directly depicted in Squad Leader. (However, the concept of the \\"half squad\\" was introduced in Crescendo of Doom, though not as a battlefield result, and further developed with the introduction of special half squad counters in GI: Anvil of Victory). Nick Stasnopolis, writing in Fire & Movement magazine (Number 73, May/June 1991) made the following comparison: > Few tactical games during this period (mid 1970s) are comparable to Squad > Leader,...which is quite popular and is of a similar scale (to Search & > Destroy and Firefight), but has a needlessly complex combat system, > leadership rules that would be more appropriate for 18th century combat and > ridiculously simplistic casualty rules. It also displays the typical > American fascination with gadgets while ignoring war's social, political, > and logistical aspects. The war-game industry has basically ignored the more > accurate portrayal of company level combat in (Search & Destroy) for the > more glamorous version portrayed in Squad Leader. ==Expansion== Three expansions (called gamettes by the publisher) were produced, Cross of Iron (COI), Crescendo of Doom (COD) and GI: Anvil of Victory (GI). ===Cross of Iron=== The first gamette (1979) { class=\\" floatright\\" -  Board 5  Forest Terrain - colspan=2  Scenarios: 13-20 } COI expands the German and Soviet orders of battle, including also Axis Minor infantry types. The original handful of vehicle and ordnance types in Squad Leader are expanded to include just about every type that saw service on the Eastern Front. Even before Squad Leader debuted, plans were being made to expand the initial release; these expansions would be called \\"gamettes\\" and concentrate on particular eras or theatres, all the while developing the basic game system with additional rules, new weapons types, and different terrain. Cross of Iron expands the armor and artillery systems considerably. The \\"design for effect\\" philosophy that had guided Squad Leader's development gave way in the case of tank combat to \\"actual data\\" taking priority over \\"effect data.\\" An initial intention to simply provide a few extras not contained in Squad Leader, such as Waffen-SS troops, the Tiger tank, and the T-34/85, gave way in the face of requests by playtesters to what amounted to a complete order of battle for both nationalities for the entire war, including dozens of different models of Sd.Kfz. 250 and 251 halftracks and PzKpfw I through VI tanks. John Hill and Don Greenwood admitted afterwards that the project got away from them, Hill sensing that he was too easily persuaded by playtesters who probably had a higher threshold for complexity than average gamers, and Greenwood saying that had he known from the beginning that the gamette would end up so large, he would \\"have broken it into two expansion kits - it simply is too much for one.\\"Designer's Notes by John Hill, Fire and Movement #16, quoted in MacGowan, Ibid. Also Series 100 was released in 1979 consisting of 10 additional scenarios for Cross of Iron, direct from Avalon Hill. Despite the additional complexity, armor buffs were pleased. Armor researcher Lorrin Bird described the impact that C.O.I. had on the war-gaming community in Special Issue #2 of Campaign Magazine: > After wading through the infantry-oriented scenarios of Squad Leader, where > the occasional rare appearance of one of the really bland and nondescript > tank types was widely cherished,...Cross of Iron...has changed the value of > the game system immensely. Now, instead of being a good infantry game, > particularly with regard to support weapons and leadership effects, the > system represents one of the best combined arms representations available > from either a boardgame or miniatures approach.

Like COI, a complete order of battle of British and French armor and ordnance is included, though American built vehicles in British service are not included (which was consistent with the pre-1942 timeframe of the gamette). Whereas COI expands the armor and artillery rules, COD gives more nuanced rules regarding the infantry and other foot soldiers, including such things as cowering and pinning, while introducing Scouts and morale disadvantages for early war infantry facing off against tanks. Additionally, many new terrain types are introduced on the two new mapboards, including marsh, river, large bridges, and orchards, as well as no less than three kinds of boats to cross a river with - Scenario 27 covers the crossing of the Meuse at Dinant by parts of the German 7th Panzer Division, with a highly-rated leader counter deemed to represent Erwin Rommel himself taking personal command. Just as COD was finalizing its playtesting, plans were made for two further gamettes; the September‚ÄìOctober 1979 issue of The General Magazine announced that GI: Anvil of Victory would include both American and Italian forces, and that a fifth and final gamette covering the Japanese would be released a year after that. Lorrin Bird described the current state of the armor game after COD's release in an article printed in Special Issue #2 of Campaign Magazine: > While the original Squad Leader game was a work of art with regard to its > fine balance of playability and detail...the gamettes are coming to > represent the \\"masterpieces\\" of wargamedom due to the unbelievable trivia > that is included. From radioless AFV's to the benefits/handicaps of having > the commander exposed, the expanding Squad Leader system is investigating > and providing rules for many features of WWII armored combat that were > previously overlooked in other boardgames and even miniature systems...The > end result of the amazing efforts being made to make the SL system as > complete as possible is that one is presented with tanks which act pretty > much like they did in real life... ===GI: Anvil of Victory=== The final gamette (1983) { class=\\" floatright\\" -  Board 8  River Terrain -  Board 12  Village Terrain -  Board 13  Rural Terrain -  Board 14  Rural/Airfield Terrain -  Board 15  Hill Terrain - colspan=2 Scenarios: 33-45 - colspan=2 Terrain Overlays: \\"A-O\\" } This gamette provides expanded coverage to American forces, as well as US-manufactured equipment as used by the British in the last half of the war, as well as certain British equipment like the PIAT that was not included in COD. The rulebook for Crescendo of Doom suggested that this game would not be available before February 1981; Squad Leader fans still recall awaiting this next game, which was finally released in 1983. The \\"gamette\\" was actually bigger than Squad Leader itself, with 856 more counters and five more mapboards, as well as three more scenarios than the original SL. As well, two sheets of terrain overlays were included in the box. The modelling of infantry was again increased in level of detail, with squads now able to \\"break to green\\", or be replaced by lower quality units when morale checks didn't measure up to their Experience Level Rating. Many players were upset that the ELR restrictions were almost always applied to American forces and not to other nationalities as a rule. (ASL would remedy this by applying the restriction to all forces of all nationalities). Point values for US forces were also omitted from the game, restricting DYO (Design Your Own) scenarios to non-American forces. Other restrictions on US troops not present in the earlier SL game also angered some players (the original SL had a rule whereby American troops were not subject to \\"Desperation Morale\\" penalties, for example, while GI dispensed with this.) And the Italian forces promised as early as autumn 1979 did not materialize (indeed, would not, until the Hollow Legions module for Advanced Squad Leader was released in 1989.) Nonetheless, the game system did go forward in many ways; according to James Collier in his history of Squad Leader printed in Issue 34 of The Grenadier: > Like (Crescendo of Doom) before it, GI brought mostly rules changes, > including some rather drastic revisions of some of the most fundamental > system mechanics. For example, in COD a provision was made to allow whole > squads to be deployed into half-squads, but without providing special half- > squad counters...GI brought a profusion of half-squad counters and also > provided a mechanism where a squad could take half-squad casualties...

Collier, The Grenadier, Issue 34 (J. Tibbetts & Son, 1988).

Avalon > Hill published several lengthy rebuttals in that issue (Vol. 20 No. 1) > attempting to address Collier's concerns. The end result was that German AFV counters did not represent some of the new changes, such as inferior turret armor, and German squad counters did not have accurate representations for such things as smoke making capability or other abilities introduced in GI. As far as the game system had come, it was clear that much of the foundation on which it was resting had to be redone and/or reorganized. In fact, GI: Anvil of Victory had already reached a point where most of the counters from the original Squad Leader game had been made obsolete, as German, British, French and American infantry counters were redone (with controversial \\"static\\" artwork depicting soldiers at rest rather than in action poses) with new information for smoke-making capability, and special weapons and morale characteristics (these characteristics would carry over to Advanced Squad Leader.) ==Additional Products== Additional products by John Hill include Across A Deadly Field and Johnny Reb. Many third-party products were produced for Squad Leader, and it is probable that privately made scenarios number in the hundreds if not thousands. Avalon Hill also released \\"official\\" additions to the Squad Leader system. ===Additional Official Scenarios=== Three sets of \\"official\\" scenarios were released by Avalon Hill directly. Series 100 was designed for Cross of Iron and released Series in 1979, consisting of ten new scenarios designed by Courtney Allen (SL playtester and designer of Storm Over Arnhem). Series 200 (scenarios 201-210) was designed for Crescendo of Doom, and Series 300 for GI: Anvil of Victory (scenarios 301-310). *Scenarios: 101-110 (Series 100) *Scenarios: 201-210 (Series 200) *Scenarios: 301-310 (Series 300) A rare case of third-party scenarios being done by license as an \\"official\\" product was the scenario pack released by World Wide Wargamers (W.W.W.) in 1982, offered by The Wargamer Magazine, containing Scenarios 81-90 for Crescendo of Doom and released in 1982. The artwork published by WWW is poorly done on this offering, which was also printed on flimsy paper, in booklet style, rather than the separate card stock scenarios normally associated with Avalon Hill SL products. A second set was released for G.I.: Anvil of Victory. *Scenarios: 81-90 *Scenarios: 91-100 ===Rogue Scenarios=== { class=\\" floatright\\" -  Board 9  Mountain Terrain -  Board 10  Forest/Village Terrain -  Board 11  Low Hill Terrain - colspan=2 Scenarios: R211-R220 } The Rogue Scenarios were available only by direct mail-order to Avalon Hill, and were so called because they required ownership of three non-standard boards (also available at that time only via mail-order). The artwork on these boards initially was of low quality. For example, the low hill mass on Board 11 in the earlier version was actually rendered in bright red, indicating it could be simulating either a Level One height, or possibly some other type of terrain such as ground level mud, wheatfield, etc. However, the boards later were redone for ASL products to the high standards previously established. Most of these scenarios require only single copies of the three new boards along with the Squad Leader series boards (specifically boards 1-8), but Scenario R220 requires access to two copies each of boards 4 and 6-10. ===ASL Annual=== { class=\\" floatright\\" - Scenarios: A1-A6 } Aside from regular features in the house organ of Avalon Hill, The General, AH also produced a series of magazines focused on Advanced Squad Leader called ASL Annual beginning in 1989; these contained some original SL content also. When Multiman Publishing (MMP) took over publication of ASL components, they started to produce ASL Journal on an irregular basis. Both magazines were in the same format as The General, with no outside advertising, and full of articles, variants, and scenarios for all incarnations of ASL. SL-themed content seems to have disappeared from the MMP- produced ASL Journal. Other third party offerings have also declined in the years since the release of ASL. ==Advanced Squad Leader and VASL== By 1983 and the release of GI, there were four separate rulebooks with sometimes contradictory or poorly integrated rules. For example, US forces with lower morale were penalized by the fact that morale ratings were used to determine at random the ability to push ordnance through snow or mud. Logically, morale should not have an effect on such an effort. James Collier, in a piece entitled \\"Glass Anvil: A Dissenting View of GI: Anvil of Victory\\", presented in Volume 20, Number 1 of The General, described the situation: > By now it should be recognized that the Squad Leader series is virtually > unique among WWII board games by being a game in evolution. The succeeding > gamettes have not been mere additions to the original, but instead have > introduced substantial revisions to the original parameters. This is even > more true with GI where the bulk of both components and rules represent > revisions rather than new material.

Now GI introduces a similar order of > revision for the infantry counters in addition to a number of new maneuvers > and capabilities. As this evolution continues, one is eventually compelled > to ask where it is going and why? It was clear that the system had grown in ways never dreamed of in 1977; large amounts of \\"nutmail\\" arriving at Avalon Hill convinced the developers of the need to streamline the rules. Originally this was anticipated as being a simple compilation of the rules in existence, possibly redoing the \\"To Hit/To Kill\\" system used to simulate armour protection and penetration in tank combat. In the March‚ÄìApril 1983 issue of Fire & Movement, developer Don Greenwood stated that he saw the next project as being a hardcover or loose- leaf version of the rules, with the \\"entire game system ... rewritten and revised where necessary\\" to make one combined \\"advanced\\" version. Greenwood also, in one of the replies to Collier in the Volume 20, Number 1 issue of The General, described this project as \\"...a rewritten, succinct and complete compilation of the entire game system in one rulebook.\\" Greenwood envisioned the new rulebook as not being available before 1985, and thought it would be followed by a gamette featuring the fighting in North Africa (and allowing a redo of the German armour counters while also introducing the Italians), followed by a Russian Front gamette redoing the Russians, and a final gamette featuring the Far East, with Chinese and Japanese troops. After that, it was expected to release historical offerings with maps modelled after actual locations. In Volume 20, Number 1 of The General, he also anticipated \\"the Advanced SQUAD LEADER Rulebook will be a major publishing event greater than any of the previous gamette releases.\\" Greenwood's prediction was correct as far as time frame; in 1985 the Advanced Squad Leader system debuted. Greenwood had stated the following in the Introduction to the GI: Anvil of Victory rulebook: > During the past two years in which G.I. has been under design, I have been > simultaneously making copious notes for the project which must ultimately > follow it: THE ADVANCED SQUAD LEADER RULEBOOK. Don't let the title fool you. > It will not be an even more complex version of what you already have, bound > together between two covers. Rather it will improve the final game system by > simplifying, cutting, and rewriting. The end result will be both a more > comprehensive and a much shorter set of rules. However, the Advanced Squad Leader Rulebook became much more than just a simple rewrite of the rules, it in fact became a complete replacement of the games of the original SL series. Some fans were much taken aback by the need to replace the four modules they had spent so much money on; only the mapboards of the earlier series would be compatible (indeed, necessary) to play the new games. Squad Leader alone has counters and counters rendered obsolete by the new system (in fact, many had already been made obsolete by the time GI was introduced). GI: Anvil of Victory has 1568 counters all of which are rendered useless by anyone wishing to continue on with the Advanced version. Greenwood's predictions on future gamettes were also inaccurate given the need to redo every counter in the system from scratch; twelve \\"core\\" modules would be needed to introduce the wide range of nationalities. The historical gamettes (called \\"modules\\" now) did evolve as predicted. The new game is also a minimum purchase of two components, the Advanced Squad Leader Rulebook, and an initial module, either Beyond Valor, which contains a brand new counter mix for the German, Russian and Finnish armies, as well as all necessary system counters, or else Paratrooper, which contains a limited counter mix for system markers, US paratrooper units and their German opponents in Normandy. Either initial module also requires ownership of boards from SL in order to play the included scenarios. Future modules also make use of mapboards previously released only with SL. The new game does not feature Programmed Instruction, requiring a thorough reading of at least four chapters of the ASL Rulebook in order to play a game with ordnance and/or vehicles in it. Even the most basic ASL components are no longer introductory in nature, though Paratrooper, masquerades as such. (This would be redressed in 2005 by the introduction of ASL Starter Kits). Avalon Hill actually suggested that anyone wishing to play ASL also purchase the original Squad Leader and gain experience with that system first, and kept the original SL and three gamettes in print. The necessity of owning boards from these modules in order to play printed scenarios in the core modules of ASL may also have been a factor in this decision. So while ASL was intended to replace SL, there was a certain ambiguity for many years about the status of SL's replacement; the original game was still necessary as a stepping stone to learning ASL, and a source for needed mapboards. Virtual Squad Leader However, the original Squad Leader went out of print after Hasbro purchased Avalon Hill. Nonetheless, there are still many aficionadoes of the original SL system, who prefer the simplicity of the earlier design to its much more complicated offspring. There are also projects similar to Virtual Advanced Squad Leader (VASL) for the original game system, which allow for live online play of Squad Leader in a virtual environment, like Virtual Squad Leader (VSQL) for the VASAL game engine. At least one programmer is working on an Artificial Intelligence (or AI) for the virtual version of SL. As home publishing software and hardware get more sophisticated, it is possible to produce high quality \\"unofficial\\" game components from scenario cards to custom sized mapboard to personalized leader counters. ==Reception== Ray Winninger comments: \\"Hill's design recreates World War II combat in the same way that a great caricaturist recreates a face ‚Äî by exaggerating the important bits and abstracting everything else. Many of the game's individual concepts are decidedly 'unrealistic.' Players possess almost omniscient knowledge of the battlefield, cardboard soldiers are all too eager to fight to the last man, key weapon systems and environmental effects are vastly oversimplified. Yet, added together, these details produce an end result that somehow feels real. By exaggerating, oversimplifying, and abstracting, Hill provides a decent primer on World War II infantry tactics ‚Äî the importance of covering fire and maneuver, the use of machine guns to prevent movement across open spaces, the key differences between German and Russian combatants, and so forth.\\" ===Awards=== *Squad Leader won the 1977 Charles S.

He is the main character of the tales narrated in the Turkish and Greek shadow-puppet theatre. ==Origins== The first shadow show was invented by a Greek-Macedonian, named Karanos, most likely during the early Hellenistic era (Alexander the Great era, or soon afterwards). The characters of this show were Pans, Greek gods, Nereids, and others, which moved behind a vertical white screen and at the front of silver projectors, based on a screenplay derived from Greek mythology. The show was first shown at the \\"Banquet of Karanos\\", and had an \\"amazing\\" didactic and amusing content, which people talked about for a long time afterward. In the 2nd c. BCE, a shadow show appeared in India, with characters and screenplay adapted to Indian folklore epic stories; similarly, in the 4th century, a shadow show appeared in the Spice Islands, Java, and so on. Shadow theatre, with a single puppeteer creating voices for a dialogue, narrating a story, and possibly even singing while manipulating puppets, appears to come ultimately from the Indonesian wayang kulit or Chinese pi ying xi Shadow play. The name Karagiozis or Karaghiozis is from Greek ŒöŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≥Œ∫ŒπœåŒ∂Œ∑œÇ, borrowed from Turkish Karag√∂z 'dark eye'. There are several stories of how shadow theater was established in Asia Minor. Many argue for a Mediterranean origin in the Egyptian shadow puppet tradition. Whatever the case, it is worthwhile to mention that regardless of religious restrictions, shadow theater became more widespread around the 16th century among the Muslim Turks. Originally, his popular appeal was his scatological language and protruding phallus. It is still performed in Turkey, especially during Ramadan celebrations, under the same name. Karagiozis seems to have come to mainland Greece, probably from Asia Minor (Anatolia) at the 19th century, during Ottoman rule. Karagiozis was hellenized in Patras, Greece in the end of 19th century by Dimitrios Sardounis alias Mimaros, who is considered the founder of modern Greek shadow theater. The genre became a fully integrated, though adapted, amongst the Greek population. But there are several legends as well as studies surrounding Karagiozis's arrival and subsequent popularity in Greece. Some stories say that Greek merchants brought the art from China and others say that it was a Greek who created the \\"legend\\" during Ottoman rule for the entertainment of the sultan. Yet others believe that it originated from real events involving two masonry workers named Karag√∂z and Haci Ivat working in the construction of a mosque in the city of Bursa, Turkey in early 14th century. ==Scenario== Karagiozis is a poor hunchbacked Greek, his right hand is always depicted long, his clothes are ragged and patched, and his feet are always bare. He lives in a poor cottage (Greek: œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨Œ≥Œ∫Œ±) with his wife Aglaia and his three sons, during the times of the Ottoman Empire. The scene is occupied by his cottage in the left, and the Sultan's Palace (Sarayi) on the far right. Because of his poverty, Karagiozis uses mischievous and crude ways to find money and feed his family. Students of folklore divide Karagiozis' tales in two major categories: the 'Heroics' and the 'Comedies'. The Heroics are tales based on tradition or real stories involving the times under Ottoman rule, and Karagiozis is presented as a helper and assistant of an important hero. Puppeteers devise their own original tales, however there are many 'traditional' tales that have descended orally from earlier puppeteers and are accepted as 'canon' with slight alterations between the players. Most of them are formulaic and have the following layout (but with a wide improvisational variety), and often involving interaction with the audience: #Karagiozis appears in the scene with his 3 sons dancing and singing. He welcomes the audience and has a comical dialogue with his children. He then announces the title of the episode and enters his cottage #The Vizier or a local Ottoman lord meets Hadjiavatis and reports that he has a problem and needs someone to perform a deed #Hadjiavatis obeys and starts announcing the news (usually a singing sequence) until Karagiozis hears about it #Initially annoyed by Hadjiavatis' shouting, he finds it's an opportunity to gain money (either by helping the Vizier or not) and sometimes asks Hadjiavatis to aid him. #Karagiozis either attempts to help the Vizier or fool him. The regular characters (see below) appear one at a time in the scene (they often appear with an introducing song which is standard for each of them); Karagiozis has a funny dialogue with them, mocks them, fools them, or becomes annoyed and ousts them violently. #Finally, Karagiozis is either rewarded by the Vizier or his mischief is revealed and he's punished - usually by the Vizier's bodyguard, Veligekas. #At the end Hadjiavatis appears on the screen and together with Karagiozis they announce the end of the show Some of the most known tales are: *Alexander the Great and the accursed snake *Karagiozis the doctorCf.

Socially, he is in closer relation to Hadji Ivat (Greek: Hadjiavatis) than any other characters, and often he is informed by him, sometimes they cooperate in business, but sometimes Hadjiavatis is a victim of Karagiozis' tricks. *Kollitiria (ŒöŒøŒªŒªŒ∑œÑŒÆœÅŒπŒ±), Karagiozis' three kids. Some versions give their names as (from older and taller to younger and shorter) Kollitiris, Svouras and Mirigkokos. *Aglaia, (ŒëŒ≥ŒªŒ±ŒêŒ±) Karagiozis' wife, who is usually unseen but whose characteristically nagging voice is heard to be coming from inside Karagiozis's house. *Hadjiavatis (ŒßŒ±œÑŒ∂Œ∑Œ±Œ≤Œ¨œÑŒ∑œÇ), (the Turkish counterpart is Hacivat) he is Karagiozis' friend and sidekick, an honest and serious figure but often ends up being wrapped up in Karagiozis' schemes. He has a tendency to flatter the powerful and is sometimes depicted as a compliant person towards the occupying and dominant establishment, contrasting Karagiozis. *Barba Yorgos (ŒúœÄŒ¨œÅŒºœÄŒ± ŒìŒπœéœÅŒ≥ŒøœÇ, \\"Uncle George\\"), he represents a crude villager from the mountains, depicted as a shepherd or dairy farmer usually on some business related visit in the lowlands; he is depicted as a Vlach from Rumeli uncontaminated by urban trends, always depicted broad built and strong with traditional outfit. Even though he believes his nephew to be a crook, he helps him out and beats all the opponents black and blue with his staff. *Stavrakas (Œ£œÑŒ±œçœÅŒ±Œ∫Œ±œÇ), whose puppet is the only one with a long independent arm, like Karagiozis. He represents the \\"mangas\\" culture prevalent in Piraeus and the Rebetiko tradition. Although trying to bully the others, Karagiozis usually teases him. *Sior Dionysios (Œ£ŒπŒøœÅ ŒîŒπŒøŒΩœçœÉŒπŒøœÇ), an Italianate gentleman from Zakynthos of some aristocratic stock. Faithful to his Ionian Islands origin, he sings cantades and speaks the Ionian Greek dialect with the appropriate accent. *Morfonios (ŒúŒøœÅœÜŒøŒΩŒπœåœÇ), a European bred softie; he is very ugly with a huge head with an extremely large nose; however, he considers himself to be handsome and keeps falling in love. He often exclaims a sound like \\"whit!\\" *Solomon (Œ£ŒøŒªŒøŒºœéŒΩ), a usually rich Jew from Thessaloniki, one of the less known characters, he speaks in his own fashion, sometimes uttering a very fast repeating sound often compared to a Gatling gun, earning him, by Karagiozis, the nickname \\"heavy arms\\", despite his frail build. His personality can vary, but usually plays minor roles. *Vizier (ŒíŒµŒ∂œçœÅŒ∑œÇ), also called Pasha (Œ†Œ±œÉŒ¨œÇ) in some versions, he is the dominant figure of the occupying side and lives in the Sarayi. He is usually the beginning of each new tale, by announcing trials, deeds, tests etc. to which Karagiozis usually decides to become involved. *Fatme (Œ¶Œ±œÑŒºŒ≠) is the Vizier or Pasha's beautiful daughter who has either obedient or rebellious roles; she has more than one way of causing trouble sometimes for good, opposing her despotic father or for bad in dislike of Karagiozis or some other hero. *Veligekas (ŒíŒµŒªŒπŒ≥Œ∫Œ≠Œ∫Œ±œÇ), an Albanian guard of the Sarai. He is the executive arm of the Pasha, always on the lookout for Karagiozis and never waste an opportunity to give him a good beating. Usually he gets beaten by Barba Giorgos. *Peponias (Œ†ŒµœÄœåŒΩŒπŒ±œÇ), a fat officer of the Sarai, in some versions replacing Veligekas. Some players have introduced other characters, like Karagiozis' old father or Stavrakas' friend, Nontas. == The puppets == All the figures that represent the characters of the shows are two dimensional and designed always in profile. They were traditionally made from camel skin, carved to allow light through the image, creating details, but are today most often made of cardboard. Traditional puppets gave off black shadows against the white screen, but some more recent puppets have holes covered with colored silk or plastic gel materials to create colored shadows. The torso, waist, feet and sometimes the limbs, were separate pieces that were joined together with pins. Most figures were composed of two parts (torso and legs) with only one joint to the waist. Two characters, the Jew and Morfonios had joints in the neck, and had a flexible head. They were moved with a stick attached to their 'back', except in the case of the figure of Karagiozis, Stavrakas and a few other characters whose arms or other limbs required separate movement. The 'scene' was a vertical white parapet, usually a cloth, called mperntes (from Turk. 'perde', curtain). Between the figures and the player (who was invisible), were candles or lamps that shed light to the figures and made their silhouettes and colours visible to the audience through the cloth. == Modern incarnations == Conrad, also known as Karaghiosis, the protagonist of Roger Zelazny's ...And Call Me Conrad (also known as This Immortal), which won the 1966 Hugo Award for Best Novel, is partially inspired by this character. In Greek daily speech, the name Karagiozis is also used as an insult more or less like clown. Puppeteers complain about this, saying that while Karagiozis can be violent, mischievous, a liar and an anti-hero, he is also good-natured and faithful, so his name should not be used as an insult. During the 1980s, Greek Television had Karagiozis shows on a weekly basis. These shows had more modern and educational themes, like for example Karagiozis living some myths of Greek mythology or visiting the moon and other planets. Some of these episodes were either live with an audience, or filmed especially for the TV show and contained scenes that required editing or special effects. There have been several recent attempts to make Karagiozis incarnations in comic books. Since the 2000s, Karagiozis is not so popular as a choice of recreation for young kids and the number of puppeteers has diminished, but remains a significant and well known folkloric figure. Today, he is performed mostly in folk feasts or festivals and on national Greek television. There are also occasional tours in the Greek diaspora. == See also == *Karag√∂z and Hacivat, the Turkish analog *Punch and Judy, an English puppet show *Spathario Museum, museum dedicated to Karagiozis named after Eugenios Spatharis. == References == ==External links== * Greek Shadow Theater by Giannis Chatzis - Greek Shadow Theater of Giannis Chatzis. * Greek Shadow Theater of Tasos Andriotis - Info of shadow theater, figures etc. * Greek Shadows: A new, comprehensive website dedicated to Shadow Theatre All you need to know about Greek shadow theatre.

In that era, it was customary to invest public funds in private companies, which were the forerunners of the public service and utility companies of modern times. The state often invested in up to 40% of the stock to build turnpikes, toll bridges, canals, and water and rail transportation enterprises. ==Claudius Crozet: Virginia's State Engineer== Claudius Crozet (1789‚Äì1864) a civil engineer and educator who helped found Virginia Military Institute (VMI) was Principal Engineer and later Chief Engineer of the Board of Public Works. He was involved with the planning and construction of many of the canals, turnpikes, bridges, and railroads in Virginia, including the area which is now West Virginia. Of the many people who help build Virginia's transportation infrastructure, Crozet is one of the better-known individuals. His work in the Antebellum period was exceptionally well-documented. ==Massive state debt== In 1861, with the onset of the American Civil War, Virginia's investments in \\"Public Works\\" was interrupted. The State had purchased a total of $48,000,000 worth of stock in turnpike, toll bridge, canal, and water and rail transportation enterprises. After the War, many of the improvements had been destroyed but the debt remained to be paid. This state debt became a major issue during Reconstruction, including questions about an apportionment to the newly created State of West Virginia. Politicians Harrison H. Riddleberger of Woodstock, an attorney, and former Confederate Major General William Mahone, a railroad builder, organized the Readjuster Party largely based upon this issue. Their coalition of newly enfranchised blacks, Republicans, and Conservative Democrats was a factor in state politics, electing William E. Cameron as governor, and sending both Riddleberger and later Mahone to the U.S. Congress. Mahone held a powerful swing vote in the U.S. Senate during the short administration of President James A. Garfield, who was assassinated. By the 1890s, the Readjusters were no longer a major force, and Conservative Democrats ruled Virginia until the late 1960s. Virginia's infrastructure debt issue with West Virginia was finally resolved in 1915, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that West Virginia owed Virginia $12,393,929.50. The final installment of this sum was paid off in 1939. ==Shift from financing to regulatory role, creation of SCC== After the American Civil War, the Board's role shifted from financing to a regulatory role, as the rebuilding and expansion of the railroads were financed largely by Northern interests. The canals and turnpikes under the Board's authority declined as shipping shifted to the newer technology. The Board of Public Works was replaced by the Virginia General Assembly with a new agency, the Virginia State Corporation Commission in 1903. ==Historical archives== Hundreds of plans and drawings of the Board of Public Works have been retained in the archives of the Library of Virginia. Many are available for viewing on-line through the Internet. The Library of Virginia's official website notes: \\"Few collections in other archival institutions are comparable. Over the years, researchers have used the records for many purposes. Maps, plans, and correspondence relating to canals have aided in the restoration of canal locks and other surviving canal features. Records relating to turnpikes and railroads assisted in resolving right-of-way questions. Field survey notes help identify changes in topography and aid in the location of archaeological sites. Surprising as it may seem, sketches made in the 1830s and 1850s of county boundaries are still consulted today.\\" == References == *https://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/guides/bpw_intro.pdf == External links == * * Category:History of Virginia Category:Transportation in Virginia Category:Defunct organizations based in Virginia Category:Defunct government agencies Category:Organizations disestablished in 1903 Category:1903 disestablishments in the United States Category:Government agencies established in 1816 Category:1816 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Virginia Board of Public Works"},{"id":"1435582","text":"Paulino Uzcudun Eizmendi (3 May 1899 ‚Äì 5 July 1985) was a Basque heavyweight boxer, who is considered to be the greatest heavyweight from Spain. Uzkudun is the Basque spelling of his last name. He was the youngest of nine siblings. In his youth, he became an aizkolari or traditional competitive Basque wood chopper. Uzcudun, known as Paulino in the United States, was the European heavyweight champion, and he fought heavyweight champions Joe Louis, Max Baer, Max Schmeling (three times) and Primo Carnera (twice) during his career. The former butcher‚Äînicknamed \\"the Basque woodchopper\\"‚Äîretired from boxing with a record of 49 wins (33 KOs), 17 losses and 3 draws. Uzcudun was a rugged boxer with a crouched stance. He had a powerful left hook, and fought the toughest heavyweights of his time. He had only one opportunity at the world's heavyweight championship, but was defeated in a fifteen-round fight by Primo Carnera of Italy on October 22, 1933. Trainer Whitey Bimstein accompanied Uzcudun to the bout in Barcelona, Spain. Later in life, Bimstein gave an account in interview, of a scene more reminiscent of the cinema: \\"I remember one day we were at a sidewalk cafe. Just as I started to put my lips to a glass of vermouth a shot splintered the glass. Believe me, I got back to the hotel in nothing flat...\\" Much more grim was his description of the Civil War in Spain beyond such high drama: \\"It was nothing to walk along the streets covered with hundreds of dead, and you couldn't tell when the fighting would break out anew.\\" Against this chaotic backdrop, Uzcudun's chance at the title took place. Shortly before the fight, Carnera balked at the Spanish-made gloves chosen by the governing boxing commission. The champion, who had insisted upon American gloves, stated loudly and in Spanish that he would not fight. The commissioner, according to Bimstein, removed himself from the room, and \\"about a dozen soldiers walked toward Carnera.\\" The champion \\"backed up hurriedly\\" and conceded the choice. As for the actual fight, Uzcudun went the 15 scheduled rounds and well enough, that \\"when the verdict was announced, the revolution started all over again.\\" A riot, which included gunfire, commenced. Uzcudun, Bimstein, the other seconds and as many as \\"three hundred others\\" took refuge under the massive ring, until troops restored order‚Äîeven with this, citizenry \\"continued rioting in the streets all night....\\" It was unfortunate for Uzcudun, whom Bimstein said \\"was the finest character among the fighters I ever met, square as they make 'em, game and tough, and in his prime a match for any of 'em.\\" Uzcudun also \\"retired\\" the famed Harry Wills, when he stopped him in four rounds on July 13, 1927. The tough and durable Uzcudun was never knocked off his feet, or KO'd until his last professional fight. On December 13, 1935, Uzcudun made the mistake of coming out of retirement to meet Joe Louis. In the fourth round, Louis hit Uzcudun with a swift, powerful right uppercut that knocked him down causing the referee to stop the fight even though Uzcudun wanted to continue. His record was 49‚Äì17‚Äì3 with 33 knockouts. In 1933‚Äì34, Uzcudun trained on the beach in Rocky Point, Long Island, New York. During a sparring session with Franklin Rosalia (1911‚Äì1972), who also summered in Rocky Point, Uzcudun received a punch that knocked him down flat. Some conjecture that this incident led to his subsequent retirement having been demoralized by this incident. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1899 births Category:1985 deaths Category:Heavyweight boxers Category:Sportspeople from Gipuzkoa Category:European Boxing Union champions Category:Spanish male boxers Category:People from Urola Kosta ","title":"Paulino Uzcudun"},{"id":"1435584","text":"Torke is a small village in Kumta taluk of Uttara Kannada district, Karnataka, India. This village is about a few square kilometres in extent. Torke traditionally is the amalgamation of Hoskatt, Naranapur, Toregazani, Torke, Devarabhavi, Hallergudi, Devana and Gonehalli. It has a Gram Panchayat. The name \\"Torke\\" is supposed to have originated from \\"tore\\", the rivulet that used to flow through the village. Local names like \\"torehalla\\" and \\"toregazani\\" also give credence to this theory. However, since this place is famous for production of salt, and a salt maker is also known to be called a \\"thoreya\\" in Kannada, Torke might also have got its name from that. == Climate == The village is a west coastal lowland and forms part of the Western Ghats. It is characterized by high temperatures throughout the year. The rainfall here is seasonal, but heavy and is about a year. Most of the rain is received in the period from June to November, mainly through south-west Monsoon. This suits paddy cultivation and is adequate for the growth of vegetation during the entire year. December to May is the dry months with very little rainfall which helps in Salt production. The \\"Naranapur\\" gazani is famous for salt production. == People == Its total population is about 1309. The major community residing in this place is Nador. Most people presently residing in Torke are agriculturists. Others indulge in salt production, government jobs, contracting, etc. Apart from a sizeable \\"Halakki-Vokkaliga\\" community in \\"Devana\\", a moderate sized \\"Harikantra\\" or fishermen community is also found in Hoskatt. == Places of interest== Devarabhavi, a hamlet of Torke has a famous temple called \\"Kengala parameshwari\\" which is named after the sacred \\"Kengalu\\" or \\"red coloured rice grains\\" being offered as \\"Prasad\\" in the temple. The small forest surrounding the temple is known as \\"Devarakaanu\\" or \\"Kaanu\\". A centuries-old Hero stone or \\"Veeragallu\\", a carved slab of stone depicting the life of an ancient \\"Veera\\" or a brave soldier can be seen in Torke. A building called \\"Ramakrishna Mandira\\" or popularly known as \\"Sanghada Mane\\" was built in the 1940s to house functions of Nadavara Sangha. However this building was recently demolished to make room for a new multipurpose community Hall. The community hall is under construction. == Festivals == In the Hindu month of Bhaadrapad, \\"Torke\\" celebrates more than 50-year-old \\"Sarvajanik Ganeshotsva \\". The celebrations last three days. Apart from a Navaratri celebration or \\"Maali Pooje\\", every summer people of Torke and surroundings also celebrate a two-day Bandihabba in its Kengala Parameshwari Temple. This \\"Bandihabba\\" culminates in animal sacrifice known as \\"Kolkuri\\". Deepavali is known as \\"Doddahabba\\" or the major festival and \\"Lakshmi Pooja\\" and \\"Balipaadya\\" hold special significance for businessmen and farmers of Torke respectively. Suggi or the festival of harvest is important for Halakki vokkaligas from Devana. == Transport == Torke is connected by road. It lies on the connecting road to Gokarna. NH-17 is about 4.5 km away. Nearest railway station is situated in Madanageri and is called \\"Gokarna Road\\" station. == Education == Torke was one of the first few primary schools in Karwar district. It is still serving the community at primary level. Shri Sadguru Nityanand High-School, Sanikatta is the nearest high school. V. K. Kawari G. P. Nayak from this village were the first two head masters of the high school at Sanikatta. Students from Torke depend on Ankola or Kumta for their collegiate undergraduate and graduate education. However now undergraduate college education is also available at Gokarna. Prior to 1964, high schools at Gokarna and Bankikodla served as their high schools for many years. Some of the established students were H. S. Naik (1954), S. B. Gaonkar (1957), V. K. Kawari (1958), R. B. Gaonkar (1959) from the Anandashram High School, Bankikodla and A. H.

Smaller populations of A. gigantea in the Seychelles exist in the Sainte Anne Marine National Park (e.g. Moyenne Island), and on La Digue, where they are a popular tourist attraction. Another isolated population of the species resides on the island of Changuu, near Zanzibar, and other captive populations exist in conservation parks in Mauritius and Rodrigues. The tortoises exploit many different kinds of habitat, including grasslands, low scrub, mangrove swamps, and coastal dunes. ==Ecology== ===Habitat=== A peculiar habitat has coevolved due to the grazing pressures of the tortoises: \\"tortoise turf\\", a comingling of 20+ species of grasses and herbs. Many of these distinct plants are naturally dwarfed and grow their seeds not from the tops of the plants, but closer to the ground to avoid the tortoises' close-cropping jaws. As the largest animal in its environment, the Aldabra tortoise performs a role similar to that of the elephant. Their vigorous search for food fells trees and creates pathways used by other animals. ===Feeding ecology=== A giant tortoise browsing leaves Primarily herbivores, Aldabra giant tortoises eat grasses, leaves, and woody plant stems. They occasionally indulge in small invertebrates and carrion, even eating the bodies of other dead tortoises. In captivity, Aldabra giant tortoises are known to consume fruits such as apples and bananas, as well as compressed vegetable pellets. Little fresh water is available for drinking in the tortoises' natural habitat, so they obtain most of their moisture from their food. The Aldabra tortoise has two main varieties of shells. Specimens living in habitats with food available primarily on the ground have more dome-shaped shells with the front extending downward over the neck. Those living in an environment with food available higher above the ground have more flattened top shells with the front raised to allow the neck to extend upward freely. ===Tortoise turf=== The Aldabra giant tortoise is a herbivorous animal, spending much of its time browsing for food in its surrounding well-vegetated environment. The Aldabra giant tortoise is known to be found in places that are commonly known as \\"tortoise turf\\". Tortoise turf is composed of:Grubb, P.

Merton, Vegetation of Aldabra, a Reassessment. Atoll Research Bulletin No. 239, The Smithsonian Institution, 1979 ==Behavior== Aldabra giant tortoise foot, an efficient digging tool Aldabra tortoises are found both individually and in herds, which tend to gather mostly on open grasslands. They are most active in the mornings, when they spend time browsing for food. They dig burrows or rest in swamps to keep cool during the heat of the day. ==Lifespan== Tortoise at Aldabra Atoll Large tortoises are among the longest-lived animals. Some individual Aldabra giant tortoises are thought to be over 200 years of age, but this is difficult to verify because they tend to outlive their human observers. Adwaita was reputedly one of four brought by British seamen from the Seychelles Islands as gifts to Robert Clive of the British East India Company in the 18th century, and came to Calcutta Zoo in 1875. At his death in March 2006 at the Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) Zoo in India, Adwaita is reputed to have reached the longest ever measured lifespan of 255 years (birth year 1750). As of 2016 Jonathan, a Seychelles giant tortoise, is thought to be the oldest living giant tortoise at the age of years and Esmeralda, an Aldabra giant tortoise, is second at the age of years, since the death of Harriet at 176, a Galapagos giant tortoise. ==Breeding== Mating Aldabra giant tortoises Between February and May, females lay between 9 and 25 rubbery fertilized eggs in a shallow, dry nest. Usually, less than half of the eggs are fertile. Females can produce multiple clutches of eggs in a year. After incubating for about eight months, the tiny, independent young hatch between October and December.Stearns, Brett C. Captive Husbandry and Propagation of the Aldabra Giant Tortoise. Int. Zoo Yb., Vol. 27, 1988, pp. 98‚Äì103. In captivity, oviposition dates vary. Tulsa ZooCollins, Dave. \\"Captive Breeding and Management of the Aldabra Tortoise\\". Presented to 8th International Herpetological Symposium, Jacksonville Zoo, Jacksonville, Fl., 1984. maintains a small herd of Aldabra tortoises and they have reproduced several times since 1999. One female typically lays eggs in November and again in January, providing the weather is warm enough to go outside for laying. The zoo also incubates their eggs artificially, keeping two separate incubators at 27 ¬∞C (81 ¬∞F) and 30 ¬∞C (86 ¬∞F). On average, the eggs kept at the latter temperature hatch in 107 days.Bourn, D. Reproductive Study of Giant Tortoises on Aldabra. J. Zool., London, Vol. 182, 1977, pp. 27‚Äì38. ==Conservation== The Aldabra giant tortoise has an unusually long history of organized conservation. Albert Gunther of the British Museum, who later moved to the Natural History Museum of London (enlisting Charles Darwin and other famous scientists to help him) worked with the government of Mauritius to establish a preserve at the end of the 19th century. The related, but distinct, species of giant tortoise from the Seychelles islands (Seychelles giant tortoise A. g. hololissa and Arnold's giant tortoise A. g. arnoldi) are the subject of a captive-breeding and reintroduction program by the Nature Protection Trust of Seychelles.Spratt, David M.J.

The Blakewater rises on the moors above Guide near Blackburn as Knuzden Brook and runs through the hamlet of that name, before taking the name Blakewater (meaning either \\"black water\\" or \\"clear water,\\" the latter deriving from Old English bl√¶c) near the village of Whitebirk. From there, the river runs through the Blackburn areas of Little Harwood, Cob Wall and Brookhouse to Blackburn town centre. The section of the Blakewater running through Blackburn town centre was culverted during the industrial revolution, and now runs underground. The culvert was extensively modified in the 1960s during the redevelopment of the town centre - it now runs underneath Ainsworth Street and between Blackburn Cathedral and Blackburn Bus Station. In recent years, the town has undergone a phase of regeneration with future proposals to open up parts of the culverted river so that the Blakewater will once again flow openly through areas of the town centre. On the western side of the town centre the Blakewater continues under Whalley Banks and through the Redlam area. The Blakewater joins the River Darwen outside Witton Country Park in Blackburn, which continues on to join the River Ribble at Walton-le-Dale. In addition to the aforementioned Knuzden Brook, the waters of the Blakewater are swelled by Little Harwood Brook (coming from Sunny Bower), Audley Brook (from the region of Queen's Park to the confluence near Darwen Street) and Snig Brook (which rises near Lammack and runs through Corporation Park). ==Tributaries== Snig Brook rises near Pleckgate and flows southwards, behind Lammack and close to Four Lane Ends, before feeding the lakes in Corporation Park. From there, Snig Brook flows down to the west of Montague Street through a culvert, meeting the Blakewater near Nab End. The entirely culverted Audley Brook rises close to the former site of Audley Hall north of the Queen's Park area of Blackburn. From there, it flows westward, meeting the Blakewater near Darwen Street Bridge, where the railway between Blackburn and Preston crosses Darwen Street. Little Harwood Brook joins the Blakewater at Bastwell (recorded in the 13th century as Baddestwysel, the latter part deriving from an Old English term meaning place where two brooks meet), having risen close to Mickle Hey and running through Brownhill, as well as having been fed itself by Seven Acre Brook (running east from Rough Hey and joining by Blackburn Cemetery near Roe Lee, for much of its course marking the boundary between Blackburn with Darwen to the south and the Ribble Valley) and Royshaw Clough (running east from near Four Lane Ends).

The river often changed colour dramatically as a result of paper and paint mills routinely using the river water to flush out dye and paint tanks. This process has now ceased, and as a result the river water is now relatively clear which has resulted in the return of trout and small fish.

Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh's Leabhar na nGenealach states that the Tuath mhac nUmhoir were led by leader Conall Caol, son of Aonghus mac √ömh√≥r. Connall was killed at the Battle of Maigh Mucruimhe in 195, and his body brought back to Aidhne where it was interred at a leacht called Carn Connell (itself the site of a major battle some centuries later). Located in the south of what is now County Galway, Aidhne was coextensive with the present diocese of Kilmacduagh. It was bounded on the west by Loch Lurgain (Galway Bay) and the district of Burren in County Clare. County Clare also bounds Aidhne on its south and south-east side. Aidhne is bounded on the east by the low mountains of Slieve Aughty, which separated U√≠ Fhiachrach Aidhne from U√≠ Maine. On the north-east Aidhne is bounded by the plains of U√≠ Mhaine and on the north by Maigh Mucruimhe (the area around Athenry). On the north-west it was bounded by the parish of Maree which was in the territory of U√≠ Bhri√∫in Seola. The diocese of Kilmacduagh contains the civil parishes of Kinvarradoorus, Killinny, Killeenavarra, Drumacoo, Kilcolgan, Ardrahan, Stradbally, Killeeneen, Killeely, Killora, Killogilleen, Kilchreest, Isertkelly, Killinan, Kilthomas, Kilbeacanty, Beagh, Kilmacduagh, Kiltartan. The diocese of Kilmacduagh contains the present Catholic parishes of Kinvara, Ballinderreen, Gort, Ardrahan, Craughwell, Beagh, Kilbeacanty, Kilthomas (Peterswell), Clarinbridge, Kilchreest. ==Early history== In the early historical era, the Aidhne branch of the Ui Fiachrach dynasty emerged as the ruling tuath in this part of Connacht. Alternative designations for the territory were Maigh Aidhne (the plain of Aidhne), Maigh nAidhne, eventually becoming U√≠ Fhiachrach Aidhne after the dynasty. The diocese of Cill Mhic Dhuach Kilmacduagh is coextensive with the kingdom, covering all of the barony of Kiltartan and large parts of the baronies of Loughrea and Dunkellin. By the 8th century the power of its kings were greatly curtailed, and became minor vassals of the Kings of Connacht. The Anglo- Norman's brought them under the rule of the Clanricarde Burkes. ==Principal septs== The important septs of the U√≠ Fhiachrach Aidhne were √ì hEidhin, √ì Seachnasaigh, √ì Cl√©irigh and Mac Giolla Cheallaigh. ===√ì Cl√©irigh=== The O Clearys were kings of the territory before the O Hynes clan but were exiled from the territory probably in the years following the Anglo-Norman invasion of Connacht. Under the patronage of the O Donnells of Ulster the O Clearys went on to become one of the most famous learned families in Europe. * Tighearnach Ua Cleirigh, King of Ui Fiachrach Aidhne, died 916 * M√≠che√°l √ì Cl√©irigh (ca. 1590‚Äì1643), chief author of the Annals of the Four Masters.

Cen√©l √Åeda na hEchtge consisted roughly of the civil parishes of Beagh, Kilmacduagh and Kiltartan and also parts of the civil parishes of Kibeacanty and Kilthomas. In the 1690s the O Shaughnessys had their lands confiscated for supporting the Jacobite cause against William of Orange. A legal battle raged on into the first half of the 18th century between the O Shaughnessys and the Prendergasts, the family who were granted the O Shaughnessy lands, with the O Shaughnessys eventually losing the case. The senior line of the O Shaughnessys appears have died out in the 1780s. * Seachnasach mac Donnchadh, namesake O'Shaughnessy, fl. 10th century. * Sir Roger O'Shaughnessy, Knight and Chief of the Name, fl. 1567. * Roger O'Shaughnessy, The √ì Seachnasaigh (died 1690), knight and jacobite * William O'Shaughnessy, The √ì Seachnasaigh, Major- General, 1673‚Äì1744. * Arthur William Edgar O'Shaughnessy (1844‚Äì1881), poet. ===√ì hEidhin=== This family were driven to the coast of Galway Bay and their principal home became Dunguaire Castle.

(Aidhne is nominative case, Aidhni genitive). Aidhne is coextensive with the present diocese of Kilmacduagh. The territory of Aidhne is bounded on the west by Loch Lurgan (Galway Bay) and the barony of Burren in County Clare in the province of Munster. County Clare also bounds Aidhne on its south and south- east side. Aidhne is bounded on the east by the low mountains of Sliabh Echtghe / Slieve Aughty (modern Sliabh Eachta√≠), which separate U√≠ Fhiachrach Aidhni from the territory of U√≠ Maine (modern U√≠ Mhaine) in eastern County Galway. On the north-east Aidhne is bounded by the plains of U√≠ Mhaine and on the north by Mag Mucruime (modern M√° Mucraimhe, the area around Athenry). On the north-west Aidhne is bounded by the parish of Meara√≠ (earlier Medraige, Meadhraighe) / Maree (Ballynacourty, Baile na C√∫irte) which is in the territory of U√≠ Bri√∫in Seola (modern U√≠ Bhriain Seola). In placename lore the kingdom took its name from the mythological Aidhne, one of the ten daughters of Parthol√≥n by his first wife, Topha. Aidhne was married to Breac. In a later age, a branch of the Fir Bolg made Aidhne their home. Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh's Book of Genealogies states that the Tuath mhac nUmh√≥ir[settled in]in D√°l gCais and in U√≠ Fhiachrach of Aidhne. Their leader is given as Conall Caol, son of Aonghus mac √ömh√≥r. Conall was killed at the Battle of Maigh Mucruimhe in 195 AD, and his body brought back to Aidhne where it was interred at a leacht called Carn Chonaill (itself the site of a major battle some centuries later). The territory of U√≠ Fhiachrach Aidhni is coextensive with the diocese of Cill Mhic Dhuach / Kilmacduagh, which contains the civil parishes of Kinvarradoorus, Killinny, Killeenavarra, Drumacoo, Kilcolgan, Ardrahan, Stradbally, Killeeneen, Killeely, Killora, Killogilleen, Kilchreest, Isertkelly, Killinan, Kilthomas, Kilbeacanty, Beagh, Kilmacduagh, Kiltartan.

The population at the 2001 Census, was 2,485, of whom 49 per cent could speak the Welsh language. At the 2011 Census, the population of the community was 2,374 and of the village 1241. Aberporth's beaches have earned Blue Flag status.Blue Flag beaches in Wales Retrieved 18 December 2011 ==Location== One of the two beaches in Aberporth Aberporth 1885 Aberporth is on the Ceredigion Coast Path, part of the Wales Coast Path, at the southern end of Cardigan Bay, about northeast of Cardigan and southwest of New Quay. The Fishguard to Bangor Trunk Road (A487) is reached via the B4333 road in about . == Etymology == The name Aberporth is first recorded in 1284, and is derived from the Old Welsh ‚Äúaber‚Äù (mouth) and ‚Äúporth‚Äù (port). ==History== In the 16th century, boats, nets and salt for preserving were brought in from Ireland. Aberporth became a subsidiary port of Cardigan. The landing point developed rapidly in the late 17th and early 18th centuries as local people began to take part in the maritime trade. It became a very active port; the northern of the two beaches extended into the river valley and provided a safe anchorage. Lime kilns, coal yards and warehouses were built on its south shore. Aberporth developed into a centre of the herring fishing industry in Wales. Drifting and netting were both employed, and at one time at least 20 full-time herring smacks, a type of traditional fishing boat, went to sea regularly. The industry continued until the beginning of the First World War, when fish stocks declined. ==Governance== Aberporth is the name of the electoral ward which is coterminous with the community, although before 1995 it was a ward of Dyfed County Council and included the neighbouring communities of Penbryn and Y Ferwig. Since 1995, the ward has elected one county councillor to Ceredigion County Council. Independent councillor Gethin James represented the ward from 2004 until the May 2017 election when he was beaten by Plaid Cymru candidate Gethin Davies. Aberporth is represented at the local level by 12 community councillors on Aberporth Community Council. ==Amenities== The small St Cynwyl's Anglican parish church was renovated in 1857, but has been decaying over the last few decades. The village has two sandy beaches: Traeth y Dyffryn (\\"valley beach\\"), also known as Traeth y Llongau (\\"ships beach\\"), and Traeth Dolwen Both have been awarded a Blue Flag several years running. Aberporth is a recreational fishing village in the summer and is also used by divers and boating people. Crab and lobster fishing continues on a small scale. In 2006 orcas and harbour porpoises were seen, but such sightings are rare. Even rarer was a turtle seen in 2005. Sunfish and basking sharks are sometimes seen offshore in the summer. Apart from tourism, the main local employer is the Ministry of Defence at the Qinetiq missile range. ParcAberporth technology park hosts organisations involved in the sectors of defence, aerospace and the technology of UAVs known as drones. ParcAberporth is linked with the research facilities at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. Aberporth Airport is being developed as West Wales AirportWest Wales Airport for domestic flights, and as a centre for the deployment of civil and military drones. The airport underwent major improvements in 2008, which extended the runway from . ==Education== Aberporth School, established in 1834, had 31 pupils in 1836. In 1854, a building for 110 pupils was built; average attendance in 1904 was 68. It was a national school providing elementary education, in accordance with the teaching of the Church of England, to the children of the poor. In 1926, it became a Church of England school. In 1915, a council school was established. Ysgol Gymunedol Aberporth is the present-day primary school in Aberporth. There were 122 pupils on the roll in 2013. Only 12 per cent came from homes where Welsh was the main language (down from 16 per cent in 2007). It was in the A/B category according to the Local Education Authority's language policy in 2001, but by 2007, it had changed into a category A school, meaning that Welsh is now the main language of teaching there. ==Notable people== *Ricky Evans (born 1960), rugby union international, was born in Aberporth. ==Weather station== The Met Office has a weather station at Aberporth.Office stations It is one of the 22 coastal locations whose reports are included in the BBC Shipping Forecast.

The album contains tracks from the band's first four albums as well as \\"Under the Bridge\\" from their fifth album, 1991's hit Blood Sugar Sex Magik and the Pretty Woman soundtrack contribution/single B-side \\"Show Me Your Soul.\\" \\"Behind the Sun\\" was released as a single and music video to accompany the release of this compilation. The song originally appeared on the band's 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan. The compilation is the only full-length release of the band to feature \\"Show Me Your Soul\\". ==Background== This album was released on EMI/Capitol Records through a deal with Warner Bros. Records. The band had left EMI for Warner in 1991 where they would record their biggest album at the time, Blood Sugar Sex Magik. EMI, who owned the rights to the band's first four albums, decided to cash in on the band's newfound mainstream success. The two labels, however, agreed that each label would allow the usage to one song recorded during the Peppers career on each label so each company could produce a greatest hits compilation. EMI chose the band's biggest hit single at the time, \\"Under the Bridge\\" for What Hits!? and Warner Bros. chose \\"Higher Ground\\", the band's most successful single for EMI for the band's 2003 compilation Greatest Hits. The title of the compilation is a joke alluding to the relative lack of success achieved by the Red Hot Chili Peppers during their tenure with EMI, highlighting the irony that many of the tracks included on what is supposed to be a \\"greatest hits\\" compilation were generally singles that peaked notably low in the charts, arguably too low to be considered \\"hits\\" (and even in some cases, such as \\"The Brothers Cup,\\" \\"Backwoods,\\" and \\"Johnny, Kick a Hole in the Sky\\", were never released as singles at all with the latter song never even being performed live). Most of the material released on this album were songs taken from Freaky Styley, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, and Mother's Milk. In 1987, the band attempted to release \\"Behind the Sun\\" as a single, but EMI didn't deem the song worthy enough to do so, although the label eventually did when the band became popular in the early 1990s. In 2013, after EMI was absorbed by the Universal Music Group, What Hits!? saw a re-release as part of UMG's Icon compilation series. ==Track listing== ==Video== A VHS and later, DVD version of What Hits!? was also released. The video collection supersedes the 1990 video collection Positive Mental Octopus. A music video for the single \\"Behind the Sun\\" was created for this video collection and received airplay at the time on MTV. The video, which was made without the band's involvement, reuses footage from the band's \\"Higher Ground\\" music video along with newly added animation. What Hits!? contains the following music videos: #\\"Behind the Sun\\" #\\"Under the Bridge\\" #\\"Show Me Your Soul\\" #\\"Taste the Pain\\" #\\"Higher Ground\\" #\\"Knock Me Down\\" #\\"Fight Like a Brave\\" #\\"Jungle Man\\" #\\"True Men Don't Kill Coyotes\\" #\\"Catholic School Girls Rule\\" #\\"Fire (live)\\" #\\"Stone Cold Bush\\" (live) #\\"Special Secret Song Inside\\" (live) #\\"Subway to Venus\\" (live) *The last four live videos were taken from the band's 1990 Psychedelic Sexfunk Live from Heaven video. ==What Promo Hits!?== Prior to the album's release, EMI released a very rare five-song CD sampler titled What Promo Hits!?.

It is located at the crossing of the Roman Ermine Street and the River Gwash. ==Geography== The village is approximately three miles to the north-west of Stamford and very close to the county border with Lincolnshire (South Kesteven). Just to the north is Tickencote. The parish boundary, to the south and east, lies close to the village, and follows the River Gwash. Just west of the B1081 bridge over the Gwash, it borders Tinwell. Just to the west of Ingthorpe (part of Tinwell), it borders Tickencote. The parish boundary crosses the A1 at the turn off for the village. The boundary then follows the A1 north, along the next hedge to the east (a field's width). It passes to the east of Tickencote Warren, and at Exeter Gorse it briefly borders Horn, then meets Pickworth. It passes to the south of Eayres Lodge, includes Woodhead, crossing Pickworth Road south of Taylor's Farm. West of Tolethorpe Oaks, it briefly meets Ryhall, then borders Little Casterton southwards, passing Frith Farm to the west and broadly follows the Danelaw Way. North of Little Casterton village, the boundary meets the Gwash. The A1 road which follows the path of Ermine Street, ran through the centre of the village until the construction of the Stamford bypass in 1960; the former route of the Great North Road is now the B1081. There is a very small nature reserve, Great Casterton Road Banks, to the south of the village containing examples of rare plants such as Sulphur Clover and Greater Broomrape. ==History== Roman town The Rectory and Parish Church in 1912 The earliest recorded settlement was a Roman fort ca 44 AD.Roman fort Great Casterton at www.roman-britain.org/ A civilian settlement developed which was later a walled town and the defences are still apparent. Archaeological excavations have been conducted on the town, a villa near the Gwash and burials including early Anglo-Saxons. Two miles north of the town are the earthwork remains of Woodhead Castle, a medieval moated ringwork with attached bailey. The parish church, dedicated to St Peter & St Paul, is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. The churchyard is entered through an arched war memorial remembering the dead of both World Wars. The benefice is shared with Pickworth, Tickencote and Little Casterton. The poet John Clare was married to Martha \\"Patty\\" Turner at Great Casterton church in 1820. ==Amenities== The village has both a primary school, Great Casterton Church of England Primary School, and a secondary, Casterton College.

It is a medium-sized species of tern with black plumage and a white cap. It closely resembles the lesser noddy (Anous tenuirostris) with which it was at one time considered conspecific. The black noddy has slightly darker plumage and dark rather than pale lores. ==Taxonomy== The black noddy was first formally described by German naturalist and lawyer Friedrich Boie in 1844 under its current binomial name. The genus name Anous is ancient Greek for \\"stupid\\" or \\"foolish\\". The specific name minutus is the Latin for \\"small\\". There are seven subspecies: *A. m. worcesteri (McGregor, 1911) - Cavilli Island & Tubbataha Reef (Sulu Sea) *A. m. minutus Boie 1844 - northeast Australia & New Guinea to Tuamotu Archipelago *A. m. marcusi (Bryan, 1903) - Marcus & Wake Islands through Micronesia to the Caroline Islands *A. m. melanogenys Gray, 1846 - Hawaiian Islands *A. m. diamesus (Heller & Snodgrass, 1901) - Clipperton Island (off western Mexico) & Cocos Island (off western Costa Rica) *A. m. americanus (Mathews, 1912) - islands in the Caribbean Sea *A. m. atlanticus (Mathews, 1912) - tropical islands in the Atlantic ==Description== The black noddy has a length of , a wingspan of and a weight of . It has dark plumage and a pale crown. There is a small white crescent under each eye and a white spot above. It has long tapering wings and a truncated tail. The sharply pointed bill is black. The feet are fully webbed and are black in most subspecies but orange in melanogenys. ==Behaviour== These birds may have become known as \\"noddies\\" because of the behaviour of both sexes as they constantly dip their heads during their breeding display. They are very tolerant of humans even to the extent that they can be picked up off the nest. They feed on fish and squid which they gather by flying low over the surface of the sea and picking them up. They may associate with other seabirds in areas where predatory fish are driving small fish to the surface. The nests of these birds consist of a level platform, often created in the branches of trees by a series of dried leaves covered with bird droppings. One egg is laid each season, and nests are re-used in subsequent years. The trees used for this purpose are various but the Pisonia is most often used, and in large trees, there are often several nests. The guano produced by these birds adds large quantities of nutrients to the soil which is of great importance to the plant communities on coral islands. ==Distribution== The black noddy has a worldwide distribution in tropical and subtropical seas, with colonies widespread in the Pacific Ocean and more scattered across the Caribbean, central Atlantic and in the northeast Indian Ocean. At sea it is usually seen close to its breeding colonies within 80 km of shore. Birds return to their colonies, or to other islands, to roost at night.

It is sometimes called search unemployment and can be based on the circumstances of the individual. It is time spent between jobs when a worker is searching for a job or transferring from one job to another. Frictional unemployment is one of the three broad categories of unemployment, the others being structural unemployment and cyclical unemployment. A person may be looking for a job change for better opportunities, services, salary and wages, or because of dissatisfaction with the previous job. Strikes by trade unions also give rise to frictional unemployment. ==Analysis== Beveridge curve of vacancy rate and unemployment rate data from the United States Bureau of Labor StatisticsFrictional unemployment exists because both jobs and workers are heterogeneous, and a mismatch can result between the characteristics of supply and demand. Such a mismatch can be related to skills, payment, worktime, location, attitude, taste, and a multitude of other factors. New entrants (such as graduating students) and re-entrants (such as former homemakers) can also suffer a spell of frictional unemployment. Workers as well as employers accept a certain level of imperfection, risk or compromise, but usually not right away; they will invest some time and effort to find a match. This is in fact beneficial to the economy since it results in a better allocation of resources. However, if the search takes too long and mismatches are too frequent, the economy suffers, since some work will not get done. Therefore, governments will seek ways to reduce unnecessary frictional unemployment. Frictional unemployment is related to and compatible with the concept of full employment. At full employment the unemployment rate will be positive because of the inevitable presence of frictional unemployment. The frictions in the labor market are sometimes illustrated graphically with a Beveridge curve, a downward-sloping, convex curve that shows a fixed relationship between the unemployment rate on one axis and the vacancy rate on the other. Changes in the supply of or demand for labor cause movements along this curve. An increase in labor market frictions will shift the curve outwards. ==Examples== One kind of frictional unemployment is called wait unemployment: it refers to the effects of the existence of some sectors where employed workers are paid more than the market-clearing equilibrium wage. Not only does this restrict the amount of employment in the high-wage sector, but it attracts workers from other sectors who wait to try to get jobs there. The main problem with this theory is that such workers will likely \\"wait\\" while having jobs, so that they are not counted as unemployed. In Hollywood, for example, those who are waiting for acting jobs also wait on tables in restaurants for pay (while acting in \\"Equity Waiver\\" plays at night for no pay). However, these workers might be seen as underemployed (definition 1). ==Solutions== Policies to reduce frictional unemployment include: * educational advice; * information on available jobs and workers; * combating prejudice (against certain workers, jobs or locations); * incentives and regulations (e.g. when the frictionally unemployed receive benefits); * relocation of industries and services; * facilities to increase availability and flexibility (e.g. daycare centers); * aid or grants to overcome a specific obstacle (e.g. if a handicapped worker is employed); * reduction of the gap between gross and net wages (e.g. by taxing consumption instead). * When handing out work permits (to foreigners), i.e. must stay with that company at the same work place address as state on the work permit. ==References== ==External links== *Market with search frictions, Scientific Background on the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2010 compiled by the Economic Sciences Prize Committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

) is a Spanish private university owned by the Society of Jesus, with campuses in Bilbao and San Sebasti√°n, and the Deusto Business School branch in Madrid. The University of Deusto is the oldest private university in Spain. ==History== ===Origins=== The University of Deusto first opened in 1886, having been founded because of the Basque Country's desire to have its own university and the Society of Jesus's wish to move its School of Higher Studies in Laguardia to a more central place. To that effect a huge building was designed by architect Francisco de Cubas, which was the largest building in Bilbao at the time. Now it is the main building of the Bilbao campus, opposite to the Guggenheim Museum, in the district of Deusto, which gives its name to the university. The Universidad Comercial (Business College), founded in 1916, was the first business school in Spain, and the only one for nearly 50 years. ===Civil War and postwar=== The advent of the Second Spanish Republic (1931) interrupted and altered university life at Deusto. On 23 January 1932, the Spanish Government dissolved the Company of Jesus by decree, and the University, owned by the Jesuits, was closed down. Some lectures still continued at the \\"Academia Vizca√≠na de Cultura\\", and the \\"Universidad Comercial\\" (Faculty of Economics) could carry on work as normal until the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. During the war, the University of Deusto became a military base, but after the fall of Bilbao in 1937 it was turned into a hospital, food supply centre, and concentration camp. It resumed classes in October 1940. ===Official recognition=== Main building of the University of Deusto, Bilbao In 1962 the University was very well known throughout Basque country and all of Spain, and its former students excelled in the worlds of business, politics, and culture. However, they had a drawback: their studies were not officially recognized by the State and they had to sit an examination at a State University. Society did not really take this circumstance into account, but action was taken so that official recognition was granted. On 5 April 1962, an agreement was signed between the Spanish Government and the Holy See that provided Catholic or Church Universities with a legal basis. On 10 August 1963, the University of Deusto received canonical approval by the Holy See. In September of that year it was recognized by the State, including its Faculties of Law and Philosophy and Arts (Modern Philology division). Since then, the number of students and centres has been increasing rapidly, first from 500 to 1,000 students, and to 2,700 five years later; ten years later there were 5,000 and at present it has reached 14,000 students. The rest of the faculties were successively recognized beginning with the Faculty of Economic and Business Sciences in 1973 and finishing with that of Computing Sciences in 1979 (which later became the Faculty of Engineering). University of Deusto is part of the Aristos Campus Mundus 2015 (ACM 2015) project as well. ===San Sebasti√°n campus=== Its origin was ESSA in 1956. ESSA was the main body that started to teach these studies and assumed the ownership of future ESTE. In the beginning, Business Management, Law, Economic Sciences and Engineering Preparatory Courses were taught. The Society of Jesus was entrusted with its running and management. In 1960 this body was named EUG, and in 1963 the first stone of EUTG, University and Technical Studies of Guip√∫zcoa was laid. During 1979, the Faculty of Economic and Business Studies-ESTE became a faculty dependent on UD and in 1990, the legal and real union of the San Sebastian centre took place as a second campus of the University of Deusto. ESTE in San Sebasti√°n and La Comercial in Bilbao merged into Deusto Business School in 2009. Nowadays, Deusto Business School, the Faculty of Psychology and Education, and the Faculty of Social and Human Sciences are present in the San Sebasti√°n campus. ==Schools and colleges== University of Deusto is composed of six schools and colleges: *School of Law *Theological College *College of Engineering *Deusto Business School *College of Psychology and Education *College of Social and Human Sciences University of Deusto also collaborates with Bizkaia Talent, the associative project of the Foral Government of Biscay to promote research, creation, innovation and knowledge in the historical territory of Biscay. In addition, Orkestra-Basque Institute of Competitiveness- is an initiative of the University of Deusto, through the Deusto Foundation, for the study of competitiveness and regional development. ==International rankings== According to the 2019 Times Higher Education World University Ranking, the University of Deusto is internationally ranked between 601‚Äì800, with their 2019 University Impact Ranking between 101‚Äì200 and their 2019 European Teaching Rankings between 126‚Äì150.

For example, an influx of city-dwellers buying second homes in a rural area can drive up house prices, making it difficult for young people in the area to get onto the property ladder. The externality operates through prices rather than through real resource effects. This is in contrast with technological or real externalities that have a direct resource effect on a third party. For example, pollution from a factory directly harms the environment. As with real externalities, pecuniary externalities can be either positive (favorable, as when consumers face a lower price) or negative (unfavorable, as when they face a higher price). The distinction between pecuniary and technological externalities was originally introduced by Jacob Viner, who did not use the term externalities explicitly but distinguished between economies (positive externalities) and diseconomies (negative externalities).Jacob Viner (1932) \\"Cost Curves and Supply Curves\\", Journal of Economics, vol. 3, pp. 23-46. Under complete markets, pecuniary externalities offset each other. For example, if someone buys whiskey and this raises the price of whiskey, the other consumers of whiskey will be worse off and the producers of whiskey will be better off. However, the loss to consumers is precisely offset by the gain to producers; therefore the resulting equilibrium is still Pareto efficient.Jean-Jacques Laffont (2008). \\"Externalities,\\" The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition. Abstract. As a result, some economists have suggested that pecuniary externalities are not really externalities and should not be called such. However, when markets are incomplete or constrained, then pecuniary externalities are relevant for Pareto efficiency. The reason is that under incomplete markets, the relative marginal utilities of agents are not equated. Therefore, the welfare effects of a price movement on consumers and producers do not generally offset each other. This inefficiency is particularly relevant in financial economics. When some agents are subject to financial constraints, then changes in their net worth or collateral that result from pecuniary externalities may have first order welfare implications. The free market equilibrium in such an environment is generally not considered Pareto efficient. This is an important welfare-theoretic justification for macroprudential regulation that may require the introduction of targeted policy tools. Roland McKean was the first to distinguish technological and pecuniary effects. == References == ==External links== *Steve Landsburg's The Tragedy of the Chametz Category:Pricing ","title":"Pecuniary externality"},{"id":"1435711","text":"Maschinengewehr is German for \\"machine gun\\" (literally, \\"machine rifle\\").

Anderson belonged to the California-based gang known as the Southside Compton Crips. Detective Tim Brennan of the Compton Police Department filed an affidavit naming Anderson as a suspect, although fans of Tupac and others have questioned his involvement in the killing. Anderson denied having anything to do with Tupac‚Äôs death and was never charged with the murder. On May 29, 1998, at age 23, he was killed in a gang-related shootout. At the time of his death, Anderson was in the process of starting his own record label. ==Murder of Tupac Shakur== On the night of September 7, 1996, Tupac Shakur, his entourage and Orlando Anderson were involved in a fight inside the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, three hours before Shakur's shooting. Later that month, Las Vegas homicide Lt. Larry Spinosa told the media, \\"At this point, Orlando Anderson is not a suspect in the shooting of Tupac Shakur.\\" Eventually in the investigation, Anderson was named a suspect.Brown, P.32 Stories circulated on the street that he had bragged about shooting the rapper, a claim he later denied in an interview for VIBE magazine. In September 1997, Anderson told the Los Angeles Times he was a fan of Shakur and his music, but then again denied being the murderer. Anderson was detained in Compton a month after the shooting with twenty-one other alleged gang members. He was not charged. However, the arrest was only tangentially connected to the Tupac shooting, as Compton police said they were investigating local shootings and not the one in Las Vegas. Las Vegas police discounted Anderson as a suspect, according to a Los Angeles Times article, because the fight in which Shakur was involved in assaulting Anderson in the MGM Grand lobby had happened just hours before the shooting. Las Vegas police failed to follow up with a member of Shakur's entourage who witnessed the shooting and who told police he could identify one or more of the assailants. That witness, rapper Yaki Kadafi, was killed two months later. The police also failed to follow up on a lead from a witness who had spotted a white Cadillac similar to the car from which the fatal shots were fired and in which the shooters escaped. A year later, Afeni Shakur, Tupac's mother, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Anderson in response to a lawsuit he had filed against Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight, Death Row associates, and Tupac's estate. Anderson's lawsuit sought damages for injuries resulting from the MGM Grand scuffle, and for emotional and physical pain. Afeni Shakur's lawsuit was filed just four days after Anderson's. The Associated Press reported in 2000 that Shakur and Anderson's estates settled the competing lawsuits just hours before Anderson's death. Anderson's lawyer claimed the settlement would have netted Anderson $78,000. In October 2011, former LAPD Detective Greg Kading, a former investigator in the murder of Christopher \\"Biggie Smalls\\" Wallace, released a book alleging that Sean \\"Diddy\\" Combs commissioned Anderson's uncle, Duane \\"Keefe D\\" Davis, to kill Shakur, as well as Knight, for $1 million. Kading and Davis claimed that Anderson was present in the vehicle that pulled up next to the BMW in which Tupac was shot. In a recorded conversation with Kading, Davis claimed Anderson fired the shots that killed Tupac. Kading's implication of Anderson was similar to allegations made in Philips' series and Scott's book. Each account said that four black men were in the white Cadillac that pulled up alongside the BMW that Knight and Tupac were riding in on the night of the shooting. The accounts independently reported that Anderson was in the back seat of the Cadillac and shot Tupac by leaning out of the back window. Kading and Philips claimed that the Crips were offered a $1 million dollar bounty to kill Knight and Shakur. However, the two accounts differ on whether the bounty was offered by Combs (as reported by Kading) or by Wallace (as reported by Philips). == 2000s investigations == In 2002, the Los Angeles Times published a two-part series by reporter Chuck Philips titled \\"Who Killed Tupac Shakur?\\" that looked into the events leading to the crime. The series indicated that \\"the shooting was carried out by a Compton gang called the Southside Crips to avenge the beating of one of its members by Shakur a few hours earlier. Orlando Anderson, the Crip whom Shakur had attacked, fired the fatal shots. Las Vegas police interviewed Anderson only once as a possible suspect. He was later killed in an unrelated gang shooting.\\" The Times series included references to the cooperation of East Coast rappers including Wallace, Shakur's rival at the time, and New York City criminals. Before their deaths, both Wallace and Anderson denied any role in Shakur's murder. In support of this, Wallace's family produced computerized invoices showing that he was working in a New York recording studio the night of the shooting. Wallace's manager Wayne Barrow and fellow rapper James \\"Lil' Cease\\" Lloyd made public announcements denying Wallace had a role in the crime and stating that they were both with him in the recording studio. Times assistant managing editor Mark Duvoisin defended Philips' series, stating they were based on police affidavits and court documents as well as interviews with investigators, witnesses to the crime and members of the Southside Crips. Duvoisin stated: \\"Philips' story has withstood all challenges to its accuracy, ...[and] remains the definitive account of the Shakur slaying.\\" The main thrust of the articles, implicating Anderson and the Crips, was later corroborated by Kading's 2011 book Murder Rap and discussed in author Cathy Scott's 2002 book The Killing of Tupac Shakur. Scott refuted the theory in a People magazine article, saying there was no evidence pointing to Wallace as a suspect. Also, The New York Times wrote, \\"The Los Angeles Times articles did not offer any documentation to show that Wallace was in Las Vegas that night.\\" In her book, Scott reviews various theories, including the Knight theory, before stating, \\"Years after the primary investigations, it's still anyone's guess. No one was ever arrested but no one was ever ruled out as a suspect, either.\\" She then (in 2002) wrote that one theory \\"transcends all the others, and implicates the white-record-company power brokers themselves,\\" implicating the bosses of the Suge Knight label. In recent years, however, archived letters of Scott's responses to readers show an evolution toward Anderson as a suspect and a dismissal of the Knight theory. == Death == On May 29, 1998, Anderson died at Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital in Willowbrook, California, following a gang-related shootout.Tupac Murder Suspect Orlando Anderson Dead MTV News , 1 June 1998, Retrieved 12 October 2019Life and death in South Central LA News The Observer, Saturday 8 January 2000 ==See also== *List of unsolved deaths ==References== == External links == *Scott, Cathy, The Killing of Tupac Shakur, Huntington Press: (paperback 2nd ed., 2002) *Chuck Philips, \\"Who Killed Tupac Shakur; Part 1 *Philips, Chuck, \\"Who Killed Tupac Shakur; Part 2\\" Category:1974 births Category:1998 deaths Category:1998 murders in the United States Category:20th-century American musicians Category:Crips Category:Deaths by firearm in California Category:Murdered African-American people Category:People murdered in California Category:People from Compton, California Category:Tupac Shakur Category:Unsolved murders in the United States ","title":"Orlando Anderson"},{"id":"1435740","text":"The wedge-tailed shearwater (Ardenna pacifica) is a medium-large shearwater in the seabird family Procellariidae. It is one of the shearwater species that is sometimes referred to as a muttonbird, like the sooty shearwater of New Zealand and the short-tailed shearwater of Australia. It ranges throughout the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans, roughly between latitudes 35¬∞N and 35¬∞S. It breeds on islands off Japan, on the Islas Revillagigedo, the Hawaiian Islands, the Seychelles, the Northern Mariana Islands, and off Eastern and Western Australia. == Description == The pale morph and dark morphs side by side. thumb The wedge-tailed shearwater is the largest of the tropical shearwaters. The two colour morphs of the species are dark and pale; the pale morphs predominate in the North Pacific, the dark morph elsewhere. However, both morphs exist in all populations, and bear no relation to sex or breeding condition. The pale morph has grey-brown plumage on the back, head, and upper wing, and whiter plumage below. The darker morph has the same dark grey-brown plumage over the whole body. The species' common name is derived from the large, wedge-shaped tail, which may help the species glide. The bill is dark and legs are salmon pink, with the legs set far back on the body (in common with the other shearwaters) as an adaptation for swimming. This species is related to the pan-Pacific Buller's shearwater, which differs much in colour pattern, but also has a wedge tail and a thin, black bill. They make up the Thyellodroma group, a superspecies of the large shearwaters that were for a long time included in the genus Puffinus. == Diet == Wedge-tailed shearwaters feed pelagically on fish, squid, and crustaceans. Their diet is 66% fish, of which the most commonly taken is goatfish. The species was thought to mostly take food from surface feeding, but observations of feeding wedge-tails suggested that contact-dipping, where birds flying close to the surface snatch prey from the water was the most commonly used hunting technique. However, a 2001 study which deployed maximum depth recorders found that 83% of wedge- tails dived during foraging trips with a mean maximum depth of and that they could achieve a depth of . == Breeding behaviour == Egg (coll.MHNT) The wedge- tailed shearwater breeds in colonies on small tropical islands. Breeding seasons vary depending on location, with synchronised breeding seasons more common at higher latitudes. Northern Hemisphere birds begin breeding around February, and Southern Hemisphere birds begin around September. Wedge-tailed shearwaters display natal philopatry, returning to their natal colony to begin breeding at the age of four. Chick of wedge-tailed shearwater in burrow, Kilauea Point National Wildlife Refuge Wedge-tailed shearwaters are monogamous, forming a pair bond that lasts for several years. Divorce between pairs occurs after breeding seasons that end in failure. Nesting occurs either in burrows or sometimes on the surface under cover. Pairs call frequently as a pair, both to reinforce the pair bond and warn intruders away from their territory. Parents also call to their chicks. The call is long, with an inhaling component (OOO) and exhaling component (err); their Hawaiian name 'ua'u kani means moaning petrel. Both sexes participate in digging a burrow, or repairing the burrow from last year. Nesting burrows of other species are also used. The breeding season of the Bonin petrel in Hawaii is timed to avoid that of the wedge-tail; in years where Bonin petrel chicks are still in burrows when wedge-tails return to begin breeding, these chicks are killed or evicted. It attends these colonies nocturnally, although nonbreeding wedge- tails are often seen at the surface throughout the day and breeding birds rest outside their burrows before laying. Juvenile wedge-tailed shearwater, Kilaeau, Kauai, Hawaii Both sexes undertake a prelaying exodus to build up energy reserves; this usually lasts around 28 days. A single egg is laid, if that egg is lost, then the pair will not attempt another that season. After laying, the male usually undertakes the first incubation stint. Both sexes incubate the egg, in stints that can last up to 13 days. Incubation takes around 50 days. After hatching, the chick is brooded for up to 6 days, until it is able to thermoregulate, after which it is left alone in the nest while both parents hunt for food. It is initially fed with stomach oil, an energy- rich, waxy oil of digested prey created in the parent's gut; later, it is fed both solids and stomach oil. Like many procellariids, wedge-tailed shearwater parents alternate long and short trips to provide food, with the parents alternating between short foraging trips (1‚Äì4 days) and long trips (about 8 days), the two parents coordinating their feeding effort. Chicks increase in size to (larger than the adults), then drop to around before fledging. Fledging occurs after 103‚Äì115 days, after which the chick is independent of the adult.

A target tug is an aircraft which tows an unmanned drone, a fabric drogue or other kind of target, for the purposes of gun or missile target practice. Target tugs are often conversions of transport and utility aircraft, as well as obsolescent combat types. Some, such as the Miles Martinet, were specially designed for the role. It was, and is, a relatively hazardous job, as live fire is typically employed and the people doing the shooting are usually still in training. ==History== ===World War 2=== Boulton Paul Defiant TT Mk III target tug, number N1697; RAF Desford, May 1944. Note the wind-driven generator that provided power for the target winch Prior to and during World War II target tugs were typically operated by the air arms on behalf of which they flew, and were usually conversions of aircraft that had failed in combat or that were otherwise unsuitable or obsolete in their design roles (see Fairey Battle and Short Sturgeon). These aircraft typically trailed a drogue fabric sleeve at the end of a several-thousand metre long cable. Student fighter pilots or air gunners would shoot at the target from other aircraft using painted bullets so that hits could be recorded and later analysed. In the RAF, Miles Master IIs were used for this purpose as part of the Target Towing Flight at the Central Gunnery School whilst the School was based at RAF Sutton Bridge from April 1942 to March 1944. Other aircraft used in this role were the Hawker Henley, the Boulton Paul Defiant and the Westland Lysander, although the RAF was by no means the only air arm to use target tugs. They were used by most air forces. The USAAF used older aircraft such as the TBD Devastator as target tugs, and the Luftwaffe and the VVS (Red Army) also used them. The chief modifications to the aircraft were a station for the drogue operator and a winch to reel in the cable prior to landing. The winch was typically powered by a small wind-turbine on the outside of the aircraft, driven by the airflow and attached to the winch via a clutch. Such devices are still used by some aerial refueling tankers to retract the refueling hose after the operation is completed. The drogue would often be jettisoned at some location convenient for recovery prior to the aircraft's landing. The drogue itself caused a great deal of drag and could be dangerous, particularly to less-powerful aircraft. If the engine failed, the drag from the drogue could be enough to reduce the airspeed of the aircraft below stall speed before the drogue could be jettisoned (see Hawker Henley). ===Post-War=== Manchester (Ringway Airport) in 1955 The use of such aircraft continued post-war, although a trend developed whereby ex-military aircraft were purchased, modified and operated by civilian companies under contract. Deutsche-Luftfahrt Beratungsdienst of West Germany and Svensk Flygtj√§nst AB of Sweden were two notable companies in the field in the post-war years, operating such types as the Hawker Sea Fury, Fairey Firefly and Douglas Skyraider. Many air arms however continued to operate target tugs on their own behalf. In later years the use of civilian companies expanded significantly worldwide, with many companies forming or entering the field in the 1960s and 1970s. The trend was still to use ex-military aircraft, for example Fawcett Aviation in Australia used two ex-RAAF CAC Mustangs from 1960 until the latter part of the 1970s.Mustangs of the RAAF and RNZAF Peter N. Anderson. A. H. & A. W. Reed. . Flight Systems Inc. commenced operations at Mojave, California with Canadair Sabres converted as QF-86E missile targets, the first aircraft making its first unmanned flight in April 1975; this company later also operated Sabres as target tugs. Retrieved 2007-07-18 Flight Systems Inc was later purchased by Tracor and these operations are still performed by BAE Systems Flight Systems with Douglas Skyhawks.http://www.landings.com Online search of US civil aircraft register database performed July 18, 2007 The practice of using ex- military aircraft as target tugs (and of air arms retaining older aircraft themselves for such use) resulted in them surviving into an era where such aircraft became desirable as Warbirds; many former target tugs are now to be found on the airshow circuit or under restoration to fly, and in aviation museums. ==Current usage== FR Aviation Services Dassault Falcon 20 modified for target towing at the 2006 Royal International Air Tattoo Today, more air arms have turned to civilian companies for provision of target towing services. Many companies operating in this field today do so using modified corporate jet aircraft instead of ex-military aircraft. Advantages of operating civil aircraft types include ease of registration (it being difficult in many countries to register ex-military jets as civil aircraft), ease of maintenance and lower operating costs when compared to ex-military aircraft. Companies active in 2007 providing target towing services include FR Aviation Services Ltd. in the UK and associated companies AVdef (in France) and Falcon Special Air Services (in Malaysia) Retrieved 2007-07-18 using Falcon 20s; Pel-Air in Australia using Learjets and (in something of a reversal of recent trends) EIS Aircraft Gmbh in Germany using Pilatus PC-9 aircraft.

They were widespread geographically, probably living on all continents. Coelophysoids were all slender, carnivorous forms with a superficial similarity to the coelurosaurs, with which they were formerly classified, and some species had delicate cranial crests. Sizes range from about 1 to 6 m in length. It is unknown what kind of external covering coelophysoids had, and various artists have portrayed them as either scaly or feathered. Some species may have lived in packs, as inferred from sites where numerous individuals have been found together. Examples of coelophysoids include Coelophysis, Procompsognathus and Liliensternus. Most dinosaurs formerly referred to as being in the dubious taxon \\"Podokesauridae\\" are now classified as coelophysoids. ==Classification== Despite their very early occurrence in the fossil record, coelophysoids have a number of derived features that separate them from primitive (basal) theropods. Among the most prominent of these derived features (apomorphies) is the way the upper jaw bones are connected (the premaxilla-maxilla articulation), which is flexible with a deep gap between the teeth in the two bones. A major source of disagreement among theropod experts is whether or not coelophysoids shared a more recent common ancestor with Ceratosauria (sensu stricto) than the ceratosaurs did with other theropods. Most recent analyses indicate the latter, that Coelophysoidea does not form a natural group with the ceratosaurians. Similarly, while Dilophosaurus and similar theropods have traditionally been classified as coelophysoids, several studies published in the late 2000s suggested that they may actually be more closely related to the tetanurans.Smith, N.D., Makovicky, P.J., Pol, D., Hammer, W.R., and Currie, P.J.

It was released on November 18, 2003 by Warner Bros. Records. Aside from their cover of \\"Higher Ground\\", all songs on the compilation are from their tenure on Warner Bros. Records from 1991 to 2002, in addition to two newly recorded songs. Greatest Hits was released along with a separately sold DVD containing most of their music videos from the same time period. The album was released with Copy Control protection system in some European markets, but not in the United States. ==Overview== While their first hits compilation album What Hits!? encompasses material from their 1984 debut to 1989's Mother's Milk, this collection of songs takes off from that point, including material from their 1991 album Blood Sugar Sex Magik up through their 2002 album By the Way. It was during this period of their career that the band became a major commercial force in the music industry. Therefore, this compilation includes the majority of hit singles released since their breakthrough cover of Stevie Wonder's \\"Higher Ground\\". \\"My Friends\\" is the only track included from the 1995 album, One Hot Minute. However, the music video for \\"Aeroplane\\" is featured on the DVD version of the compilation. Also absent was the top ten hit \\"Around the World\\" from 1999's Californication although the DVD contained the music video. Conversely, \\"Breaking the Girl\\" was not included on the DVD, as was not \\"Parallel Universe\\", which never had a video released. Of their eight U.S. number one singles on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart up to that point, only one of them, \\"Can't Stop\\", from their 2002 album By the Way, was excluded, though again the music video was featured on the DVD. To date, worldwide sales show that Greatest Hits has outsold six of the band's eleven studio albums including Mother's Milk and I'm With You, making it the band's fifth-highest-selling release. ==Unreleased studio album== In 2011, Chad Smith discussed the recording sessions for Greatest Hits, saying they recorded sixteen songs and wanted to release a new album of that material after a brief tour; however, by that time John was against doing that because the style he was playing had changed and evolved as had his musical influences. Smith said there is an entire Red Hot Chili Peppers album out there that nobody will likely ever hear. Aside from the two tracks that appear on this compilation (\\"Fortune Faded\\" and \\"Save the Population\\"), only two other studio tracks from these sessions have been officially released. \\"Bicycle Song\\" and \\"Runaway\\" appeared as bonus tracks on the deluxe edition of By the Way when it was released on iTunes in 2006 and they can now be found on many other digital music stores. Live versions of several other songs have also been released. \\"Rolling Sly Stone\\" and \\"Leverage Of Space\\" were released on the Red Hot Chili Peppers Live in Hyde Park album in 2004 and \\"Mini-Epic (Kill for Your Country)\\" was released as an \\"official\\" bootleg in 2015.

(2012). International Economics: Theory & Policy (9th ed.). Harlow (UK): Pearson Education Limited, p. 327.

Oxford (UK): Oxford University Press, p. 39. Depreciation describes the devaluation of fixed capital through wear and tear associated with its use in productive activities. Closely related to the concept of GNP is another concept called NNP of a country. NNP is a more accurate measure of total value of goods and services by a country. It is derived from GNP figures. As a rough estimate, GNP is very useful indicator of total production of a country. But if we are interested to have an accurate and true measure of what a country is producing and what is available for uses, then GNP has a serious defect. In national accounting, net national product (NNP) and net domestic product (NDP) are given by the two following formulas: :NNP = GNP - Depreciation :NDP = GDP - Depreciation == Use in economics== Although the net national product is a key identity in national accounting, its use in economics research is generally superseded by the use of the gross domestic or national product as a measure of national income, a preference which has been historically a contentious topic (see e.g. Boulding (1948)Boulding, K.E.

Karpis led the gang along with Fred Barker and Arthur \\"Doc\\" Barker. There were only four \\"public enemies\\" ever given the title of \\"Public Enemy #1\\" by the FBI and he was the only one to be taken alive. The other three, John Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, and Baby Face Nelson, were all killed before being captured. He also spent the longest time as a federal prisoner at Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary, serving twenty-six years. ==Early life== Karpis was born to Lithuanian immigrants John (Jonas) and Anna (Ona) Karpaviƒçius in Montreal, Quebec, and was raised in Topeka, Kansas.Bryan Burrough (2004). Public Enemies. New York. He started in crime at about age 10, selling pornography and running around with gamblers, bootleggers, and pimps. In 1926, he was sentenced to 10 years at the State Industrial Reformatory in Hutchinson, Kansas, for an attempted burglary. He escaped with another inmate, Lawrence De Vol, and went on a year-long crime spree, interrupted briefly, while he lived with his parents after De Vol was arrested. After moving to Kansas City, Missouri, he was caught stealing a car and sent back to the reformatory. Transferred to the Kansas State Penitentiary in Lansing, he met Fred Barker, who was in prison for bank burglary. Barker was one of the notorious members of the \\"Bloody Barkers,\\" as the newspapers of the time called them. The Barker family included brothers Herman, Lloyd, Arthur (\\"Doc\\"), and Fred, the sons of Ma Barker. Growing up impoverished in a sharecropping family, all the boys soon turned into hardened criminals, robbing banks and killing without provocation. Doc was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1920 after murdering a night watchman. Herman committed suicide on August 29, 1927, after being badly injured in a shootout with police in Wichita, Kansas, following the robbery of the Newton Ice Plant in Newton, Kansas, with Charles Stalcup and Porter Meeks. Lloyd was sentenced to 25 years in 1922, for mail theft, and released in 1938; he was a US Army cook at a POW camp and then was murdered by his wife in 1949. \\"Ma\\" did her part to help her sons. \\"Ma\\" Barker was not herself a criminal, but badgered parole boards, wardens, and governors for the release of her boys when they were incarcerated. After Alvin was released in 1931, he joined up with Fred Barker in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and they soon put together the Barker-Karpis Gang.FBI Barker-Karpis gang summary, p. 4 ==Criminal career== The Barker-Karpis Gang became one of the most formidable criminal gangs of the 1930s. They did not hesitate to kill anyone who got in their way, even innocent bystanders. On December 19, 1931, Karpis and Fred Barker killed Sheriff C. Roy Kelley, who was investigating their robbery of a store in West Plains, Missouri. The gang, including Ma Barker and her paramour Arthur Dunlop, fled to St. Paul, Minnesota.FBI Barker-Karpis gang summary, p. 6 Karpis has been described as the leader or \\"brains\\" of the gang.Barker/Karpis Gang Site of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation. Retrieved 14 May 2020. Gang member Fred Hunter said Karpis was \\"super smart\\" and he was reported to have a photographic memory. The other leaders were Doc and Fred, both now out of prison, and the gang included about 25 others. At this time a myth was started that Ma Barker ruled the gang with an iron fist, but the facts do not seem to support these claims. It is highly unlikely that criminals as adept as Karpis, and even Ma's sons for that matter, would have listened to her. Karpis later wrote about this subject in his memoirs: > Ma was always somebody in our lives. Love didn't enter into it really. She > was somebody we looked after and took with us when we moved city to city, > hideout to hideout. It is no insult to Ma's memory that she just didn't have > the know-how to direct us on a robbery. It would not have occurred to her to > get involved in our business, and we always made it a point of only > discussing our scores when Ma wasn't around. We'd leave her at home when we > were arranging a job, or we'd send her to a movie. Ma saw a lot of movies. Harvey Bailey, another well-known bank robber of the era, knew the Barker gang well, and in his autobiography published in the 1970s, he agreed with Karpis, observing that Ma Barker \\"couldn't plan breakfast,\\" and was certainly no mastermind behind any gang activity.Burrough, p. 33. It is purported that Ma Barker's entire reputation as a criminal mastermind was concocted by Hoover to protect the FBI's public image after federal agents discovered they had killed a 62-year-old mother. In 1933, on the same weekend as the Kansas City Massacre, they kidnapped William Hamm, a millionaire Minnesota brewer outside of his office. After the gang was paid a ransom of $100,000, Hamm was released. Shortly after this, they abducted St. Paul banker Edward Bremer, who was released after the gang was paid $200,000 by his family. The kidnappings, however, led to the gang's end. The father of the kidnapped Edward Bremer was a friend of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt had even mentioned the kidnapping in one of his fireside chats, and fueled also by the Lindbergh kidnapping, the FBI and local police bureaus greatly stepped up their pursuit of those engaged in these types of crimes. The FBI had by this time organized a group of highly skilled agents called the \\"flying squads,\\" which specialized in hunting down the leading public enemies, and they had been very effective. The year 1934 alone saw the deaths of John Dillinger, Bonnie and Clyde, Charles \\"Pretty Boy\\" Floyd, Lester \\"Baby Face Nelson\\" Gillis, John \\"Red\\" Hamilton, Homer Van Meter, Tommy Carroll, and Eddie Green. Just after Ma and Fred's death in a shootout with the FBI on January 16, 1935, Karpis nearly met his own violent end when the FBI located him in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Karpis and Harry Campbell managed to shoot their way to an escape, though Karpis' eight-month-pregnant girlfriend Dolores Delaney was hit in the thigh by a wild shot fired by Campbell. She was captured along with Campbell's girl. Dolores gave birth to a son, who was adopted by Karpis' parents. Karpis and Campbell hid out with brothel-keeper Edith Barry for several months. Karpis continued his crimes with others, but had to keep on the move more than ever, as he was the fourth and last of the FBI's Public Enemies Number One, the previous three‚ÄîJohn Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd and Baby Face Nelson‚Äîhaving been killed. He did manage to pull off a crime that echoed the times of the \\"Old West,\\" a train robbery in Garrettsville, Ohio, which netted $27,000. After the death of Ma and Fred, Karpis allegedly sent word to FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover that he intended to kill Hoover the way Hoover had killed Ma and Fred. According to Karpis in The Alvin Karpis Story, the death threat was a rumor started by Hoover himself. ==Pursuit and capture by FBI== The FBI had come a long way since its reorganization and renaming in 1935 (from the Bureau of Investigation, created in 1908). J. Edgar Hoover was appointed as the acting head of the Bureau in 1924 and completely transformed the agency. Despite its successes, however, the agency had many problems. In those days, when the application of science and technology to fight crime was still in its infancy, the agency was at the mercy of public citizens for information. Often agents on bad information were sent off to remote locales on \\"tips\\" that turned out to be red herrings. The personal low point for Hoover came at an April 1936 United States Senate hearing. Senator Kenneth McKellar of Tennessee lambasted Hoover for the performance of the FBI and the fact that Hoover himself had never personally arrested anyone. After the hearing, a determined Hoover vowed he would capture Karpis personally.Burrough, p. 536. Hoover did not have to wait long. On May 1, 1936, the FBI located Karpis in New Orleans, and Hoover flew there to be in charge of the arrest. Shortly after 5pm on May 2, as a dozen or so agents swarmed over Karpis' car, Hoover announced to Karpis that he was under arrest. A couple of versions of the arrest have been reported. Karpis' version, told in his memoirs, was that Hoover came out only after all the other agents had seized him. Only then did the agents call to Hoover that it was safe to approach the car. The official FBI version states that Hoover reached into the car and grabbed Karpis before he could reach a rifle in the back seat. In fact, the car, a Plymouth coupe, had no back seat. The scene was further confused when Hoover told his men to \\"put the [hand]cuffs on him.\\"Burrough, p. 540 Not one agent had brought handcuffs.Burrough, pg. 540 Karpis was tied up with an agent's necktie. The capture of Karpis catapulted Hoover into the public eye and made his name synonymous with law enforcement until he died in 1972 at the age of 77. The capture of Karpis essentially ended the age of the big-name Depression Era criminal. In addition to those mentioned earlier, others killed violently in the 1930s included Jack \\"Legs\\" Diamond, Vincent \\"Maddog\\" Coll, Frank \\"Jelly\\" Nash and Dutch Schultz. Al Capone was in Alcatraz and slowly going insane from syphilis. ==Trial== Karpis was brought to trial at the St. Paul Federal Courts Building (now Landmark Center). Karpis initially pleaded not guilty. But as the case was called for trial, \\"Thomas J. Newman, attorney for Karpis, told the court his client, one of the actual kidnappers of Hamm, desired to plead guilty.\\"St. Paul Daily News, 14 July 1936, p. 1 col. 7. Two weeks later, Karpis offered \\"through his attorney, Thomas Newman, to plead guilty to the Bremer conspiracy\\" if kidnapping charges were dropped; the court accepted the offer.Albert Lea (Minn.) Evening Tribune, 29 July 1936, p. 1 col. what4. ==Imprisonment== Sentenced to life imprisonment, Karpis was incarcerated at the then recently constructed Alcatraz federal penitentiary from August 1936 to April 1962. For six months in 1958, he was transferred to the Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary, but was then returned to Alcatraz. His main job at Alcatraz was working in the bakery. He was far from a model prisoner, frequently fighting with other inmates. Karpis served the longest sentence of any prisoner at Alcatraz: 26 years. In April 1962, with Alcatraz in the process of being closed, he was transferred to McNeil Island Penitentiary in Washington state. While at McNeil, Karpis met a young Charles Manson. Karpis wrote about Manson in his autobiography with Robert Livesey (1980): After Manson had become proficient on the guitar, he asked Karpis for help in getting a job playing in Las Vegas, as Karpis had contacts with nightclub and casino owners there. Manson told him he would be bigger than the Beatles, but Karpis decided to leave Manson on his own regarding his music career. ==Later years== Karpis had his fingerprints removed in 1934 Karpis was released on parole in 1969 and deported to Canada, although he initially had difficulty obtaining Canadian passport credentials, having had his fingerprints removed by underworld physician Joseph Moran in 1934. He settled in Montreal. He wrote his first memoirs in 1971, while another memoir book was published in 1980, one year after his death. During his first book tour across Canada for Public Enemy Number One for McClelland & Stewart (published in the United States as The Alvin Karpis Story), Karpis, looking more like an accountant than a gangster, still showed a dry sense of humor. In Edmonton, Alberta, while shuffling Karpis between various interviews with the media, M&S; book rep Ruth Bertelsen made a stop at her bank. Asking Karpis if he wanted to come in with her, Karpis replied, \\"No, dear. You take care of the vault. I'll drive.\\" He became a mentor to her young son until the sociopathy of some of his advice to her child angered Miss Bertelsen. He moved to Spain in 1973. On August 26, 1979, he died by what was originally ruled suicide by the authorities, as sleeping pills were found by his body, but later it was ruled death from natural causes. Some closer to the scene say foul play may have been involved. Robert Livesey, who co-wrote Karpis's 1979 book, said Karpis was not the type to commit suicide. Livesey said Karpis was a survivor, having served 33 years in prison, and also stated Karpis was anticipating the publication of the book. Livesey believed Karpis had been introduced to pills and alcohol by his last girlfriend Nancy, to give a relaxing high, and perhaps Karpis accidentally over-indulged on one occasion, with fatal consequences. No autopsy was performed, and Karpis was buried the next day in Spain. ==See also== * List of Depression-era outlaws ==References== ==External links== * FBI file on Alvin Karpis * Public Enemy No. 1 * Alvin Karpis Category:1907 births Category:1979 deaths Category:American bank robbers Category:American expatriates in Spain Category:American kidnappers Category:American people of Lithuanian descent Category:Canadian bank robbers Category:Canadian emigrants to the United States Category:Canadian mobsters Category:Canadian people of Lithuanian descent Category:Crimes in Minnesota Category:Criminals from Montreal Category:Deaths in Spain Category:Depression-era gangsters Category:Escapees from Kansas detention Category:Inmates of Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary Category:People from Topeka, Kansas ","title":"Alvin Karpis"},{"id":"1435828","text":":St. Andrew's College, Prince Edward Island redirects to here. St. Dunstan's University (SDU) is a former university which was located on the northern outskirts of Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada. SDU merged with Prince of Wales College (PWC) in 1969 to form the University of Prince Edward Island. St. Dunstan's College was founded by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Charlottetown on January 15, 1855 as a seminary which trained young men for the Catholic clergy. The St. Andrew's College, founded in 1831, was its predecessor.UPEI History By the mid-20th century, the college had expanded into a small liberal arts university. A post-Second World War enrollment boom mandated an expansion which saw new residences and teaching buildings constructed on the campus located along Charlottetown's Elm Avenue (the Malpeque Road). SDU received a provincial degree-granting charter in 1917 but didn't actually award its first bachelor's degrees until the spring 1941 convocation. SDU had formerly been affiliated with Universit√© Laval, awarding joint degrees from the 1890s onward. Following the decision to start granting its own degrees, SDU severed the relationship with Laval by 1956. Similarly to PWC, SDU also operated a high school, offering senior matriculation to those students wishing to continue into academic or professional studies. Saint Dunstan's sports teams were known as the Saints. By the 1960s, the provincial government in Prince Edward Island began a critical study of its post- secondary education institutions (PWC and SDU), concluding that a merger to form a provincial university was the desired funding and service model for future students. The merger was not without controversy as emotions ran high among supporters of both institutions; however, in May 1969 the last classes graduated from PWC and SDU, and the institutions were merged into the University of Prince Edward Island, which opened for the first time in September 1969 on what had been the SDU campus. At the same time as UPEI was formed, Elm Avenue was renamed by the City of Charlottetown to University Avenue, a name by which it is still referred to. The PWC campus on Grafton Street was taken over by the provincial government and formed the basis for a community college known as Holland College. ==Notable students and alumni== * Mike Duffy - Canadian Senator and journalist who briefly attended Saint Dunstan's University * Jim Foley - CFL football player * Bill MacMillan - NHL hockey player and coach * Don McDougall - businessman * James Cardinal McGuigan - Cardinal named by Pope Pius XII and Archbishop of Toronto, Ontario * James Jeffrey Roche - 19th-century Irish-American poet and diplomat ==External links== * St. Dunstan's University history - provided by UPEI * St. Dunstan's University Board of Governors - continuing to advance the mandate of SDU with religious education and scholarships ==References== Category:Educational institutions established in 1855 Category:Defunct universities and colleges in Canada Category:Catholic universities and colleges in Canada Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 1969 Category:Education in Charlottetown Category:University of Prince Edward Island Category:1855 establishments in Canada Category:1969 disestablishments in Prince Edward Island Category:Universities and colleges in Prince Edward Island ","title":"Saint Dunstan's University"},{"id":"1435831","text":"Trichorrhexis nodosa is a defect in the hair shaft characterized by thickening or weak points (nodes) that cause the hair to break off easily.James, William; Berger, Timothy; Elston, Dirk (2005). Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. .Freedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . This group of conditions contributes to the appearance of hair loss, lack of growth, and damaged-looking hair. ==Symptoms== Among the symptoms (and signs) for this condition are the following: * lack of apparent hair growth * hair appears patchy * hair breaks easily close to scalp * hair may have thickenings or nodes in the shaft * ends of hair thinned or split * whitish discoloration of hair tips * hair breaks easily at tips ===Complications=== This condition is not dangerous but may affect self-esteem. ==Causes== Trichorrhexis may have a genetic basis but appears to be precipitated by environmental factors. Among Caucasians the defect often appears at the ends of the hair shaft with splitting of the ends, thinning and whitish discoloration. These conditions are directly related to environmental causes such as \\"perming\\", blow drying, aggressive hair brushing, and excessive chemical exposure. In some cases, trichorrhexis nodosa may be caused by an underlying disorder such as argininosuccinic aciduria, Menkes' kinky hair syndrome, Netherton's syndrome, hypothyroidism, or trichothiodystrophy. ==Diagnosis== Examination of the hair shafts with a microscope may reveal changes of trichorrhexis nodosa. ==Prevention== Avoid aggressive brushing and grooming, strong chemicals, permanents, straightening, and similar hair-damaging habits. ==Treatment== Improving environmental factors will reduce damage to the hair. Gentle brushing with a soft brush should replace more aggressive brushing, ratting, or other procedures. Harsh chemicals such as hair straightening compounds and permanents should be avoided. The hair should not be ironed. Excessively harsh shampoo should be avoided. Hair conditioners should be used. ==Prognosis== This condition is self-limiting.

Welch was an adherent to the Wesleyan Methodist Connexion which strongly opposed \\"manufacturing, buying, selling, or using intoxicating liquors\\" and advocated the use of unfermented grape juice instead of wine for administering the sacrament of the Eucharist, or communion, during the church service.Hallett, Anthony; and Hallett, Diane. \\"Thomas B.

Landis (1833‚Äì1900) to create his own alcohol-free utopian society, a \\"Temperance Town\\" based on agriculture and progressive thinking. Landis declared that he was \\"about to build a city, and an agricultural and fruit-growing colony around it.\\" The population reached 5,500 by 1865.Our People of the Century: Charles K.

Landis determined the potential in growing grapes and named the settlement \\"Vineland\\", and advertised to attract Italian grape growers to Vineland, offering 20 acres (81,000 m2) of land that had to be cleared and used to grow grapes. Welch had moved to the region following his sister who was one of Vineland's earliest residents and began to produce an \\"unfermented wine\\" (grape juice) from locally grown grapes that was marketed as \\"Dr. Welch's Unfermented Wine\\".The Founding of Vineland and Its Growth as an Agricultural Center, West Jersey and South Jersey Heritage. Accessed August 28, 2007. This product became \\"Welch's Grape Juice\\" in 1893 when Welch and his son Charles E. Welch (also a practicing dentist) had decided to incorporate in 1893 as the Welch's Grape Juice Company at Westfield, New York. The product was given to visitors at international exhibitions. The oldest extant structure associated with the company is Welch Factory Building No. 1, located at Westfield, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. As the temperance movement grew, so did the popularity of grape juice. In 1913, Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan served grape juice instead of wine during a full- dress diplomatic function, and in 1914, Josephus Daniels, Secretary of the Navy, forbade any alcoholic drinks on board of naval ships, actively replacing them with grape juice. During World War I, the company supplied \\"grapelade\\", a type of grape jam, to the military and advertised aggressively. Subsequent development of new grape products and sponsorship of radio and television programs made the company very successful. An advertisement in a journal from the year 1914 states: > Welch's Grape Juice has attained its popular and professional favor through > merit alone.

Since then, the trio has recorded three subsequent albums, Population: 1975 in 1999, 3 in 2001, and Make Yr Life in 2004. They have also appeared on a number of compilations of note, including Being Out Rocks, produced by the Human Rights Campaign (Centaur Productions, 2002), and Fields And Streams (Kill Rock Stars, 2002). In 2005 the band announced a hiatus. The first three albums were released by the now-defunct Mr. Lady Records, run by Kaia Wilson and Tammy Rae Carland. It was named after Wilson's first solo LP, Ladyman, created after leaving Team Dresch. The label also released the first two Le Tigre recordings. Make Yr Life was released by Yep Roc. The track \\"Sex (I'm a Lesbian)\\" appeared on Mr. Lady's 1999 sampler album, New Women's Music Sampler. In 2001, a live rendition of the track \\"Disco\\" appeared on another sampler album, Calling All Kings & Queens. Kaia Wilson had previously performed in Adickdid and the queercore band Team Dresch, appearing on their first two albums, Personal Best and Captain My Captain; Melissa York was also in Team Dresch, playing drums on the second LP and, prior to that, performing in two hardcore punk bands, Vitapup and Born Against, before the two women joined with Alison Martlew to form The Butchies. The Butchies also played on the 2001 Amy Ray (of the Indigo Girls) album Stag on Daemon Records and backed her up on tour. ==Discography== ;Albums *Are We Not Femme?

It has been deemed a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and a Grade II* listed building. In the Domesday Book there are two references to Portslade: :\\"Oswald holds half a hide in Portslade he held it before 1066. It did not pay tax, he could go where he would with the land, One villager, value 6s\\". :\\"Albert held half a hide in Portslade. It did not pay tax. One villager with half plough. The value is and was 6s.\\" In 1312, the Lord of the Manor of Portslade, John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey, was granted a charter by King Edward II to hold a Fair at Portslade annually on 6 December, the Feast Day of Saint Nicolas. Portslade Manor House was in use until 1807 when the new manor house was built. The old house was then used as an almshouse for the poor. In the Victorian era it was partially demolished, to provide building material for a garden folly in the new manor grounds. In 2019 Fresh Start Portslade were granted a National Lottery Grant to improve access and visibility of Portslade's Norman Manor house, communicate its historic importance, and explore possible solutions for its longer-term sustainability. ==See also== *Grade II* listed buildings in Brighton and Hove ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in East Sussex Category:Scheduled Ancient Monuments in East Sussex Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Brighton and Hove ","title":"Portslade Manor"},{"id":"1435887","text":"The Mahakiranti or Maha-Kiranti ('Greater Kiranti') languages are a proposed intermediate level of classification of the Sino-Tibetan languages, consisting of the Kiranti languages and neighbouring languages thought to be closely related to them. Researchers disagree on which languages belong in Mahakiranti, or even whether Mahakiranti is a valid group. The group was originally proposed by George van Driem, who retracted his proposal in 2003 after a field study in Bhutan. ==Conceptions of Mahakiranti== van Driem (2001) posits that the Mahakiranti languages besides Kiranti proper are Newar, Baram, and Thangmi. Baram and Thangmi are clearly related, but it is not yet clear if the similarities they share with Newar demonstrate a 'Para-Kiranti' family, as van Driem suggests, or if they are borrowings. He sees Lepcha, Lhokpu, and the Magaric languages (in the narrow sense, whether or not Chepangic proves to be Magar) as the Bodic languages closest to Mahakiranti. ;van Driem's conception of Mahakiranti: Matisoff's Mahakiranti includes the Newar and the Magaric languages along with Kiranti. He groups Mahakiranti with the Tibeto-Kanauri languages (in which he includes Lepcha) as Himalayish. Bradley (1997) adds Magar and Chepang to van Driem's Mahakiranti and calls the result Himalayan. This, along with his \\"Bodish\\" (equivalent to Tibeto-Kanauri), constitutes his Bodic family. Ethnologue (15th ed.) posits Magaric, Chepang, and Newar alongside Kiranti; Mahakiranti is in turn posited to be related to Tibeto- Kanauri in a Himalayish branch, largely equivalent to other scholars' Bodic. Benedict (1972) included Newar and Chepangic, but not Magaric. He mistakenly classified Vayu as Chepangic and thus named the family Bahing‚ÄìVayu. ==Retraction of the hypothesis by van Driem == After a field visit to Bhutan, van Driem, the original proponent of this hypothesis, collected data on the Gongduk language which made him realize morphological traits common between Kiranti and Newarish are not unique to either Kiranti or Newari but a shared retention of a far older trait. He retracted his proposal in 2003. ==See also== *Newaric languages ==Notes== ==References== * George van Driem (2001).

The term is also sometimes used to describe gremlins, mythical creatures known for causing problems in airplanes and mechanical devices. Today, these creatures are more commonly associated with an alleged alien species called greys, whose skin color is described as not green, but grey. During the reports of flying saucers in the 1950s, the term \\"little green men\\" came into popular usage in reference to aliens. In one classic case, the Kelly-Hopkinsville sighting in 1955, two rural Kentucky men described a supposed encounter with metallic-silver, somewhat humanoid-looking aliens no more than in height. Employing journalistic licence and deviating from the witnesses' accounts, many newspaper articles used the term \\"little green men\\" in writing up the story. ==Extraterrestrial definition== Extraterrestrials in Arthur Leo Zagat's novel Drink We Deep depicted as little green men on the cover of the January 1951 issue of Fantastic Novels Usage of the term clearly predates the 1955 incident; for example, in England reference to little green men or children dates back to the 12th century green children of Woolpit, though exactly when the term was first applied to extraterrestrial aliens has been difficult to pin down. In his historical satire A History of New York (1809), American author Washington Irving described Lunatics (or men from the moon) as \\"pea green,\\" in contrast to the \\"white\\" inhabitants of Earth. Folklore researcher Chris Aubeck has used electronic searches of old newspapers and found a number of instances dating from around the turn of the 20th century referring to green aliens. Aubeck found one story from 1899 in the Atlanta Constitution, about a little green-skinned alien, in a tale called Green Boy From Hurrah, \\"Hurrah\\" being another planet, perhaps Mars. Edgar Rice Burroughs referred to the \\"green men of Mars\\" and \\"green Martian women\\" in his first 1912 science fiction novel A Princess of Mars, though at 10 to 12 feet tall, they were hardly \\"little\\". However, the first use of the specific phrase \\"little green man\\" in reference to extraterrestrials that Aubeck found dates to 1908 in the Daily Kennebec Journal (Augusta, Maine), in this case the aliens again being Martians. In 1910 (or 1915), a \\"little green man\\" was allegedly captured from his crashed spaceship in Apulia, in south-east Italy. Green aliens soon came to commonly portray extraterrestrials and adorned the covers of many of the 1920s to 1950s science fiction pulp magazines with pictures of Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon battling green alien monsters. The first documented print example specifically linking \\"little green men\\" to extraterrestrial spaceships is in a newspaper column satirizing the public panic following Orson Welles' famous War of the Worlds Halloween broadcast of October 31, 1938. The column by reporter Bill Barnard in the Corpus Christi Times the next day begins, \\"Thirteen little green men from Mercury stepped out of their space ship at Cliff Maus Field [local airport] late yesterday afternoon for a good-will visit to Corpus Christi\\" and ends with, \\"Then the 13 little green men got in their space ship and flew away.\\"Corpus Christi Times, November 1, 1938, page 1, available at electronic newspaper archives of Ancestry.com The familiarity with which the term was used suggests that this probably was not the first instance where it was applied to extraterrestrials in spaceships. In 1946, Harold M. Sherman published a pulp science fiction book entitled The Green Man: A Visitor From Space. The cover illustration was of a normal-looking and proportioned human being, albeit with a green skin. Nationally syndicated columns by humorist Hal Boyle spoke of a green man from Mars in his flying saucer in early July 1947 during the height of the brand new flying saucer phenomenon in the U.S. that started June 24 after Kenneth Arnold's famous sighting and the Roswell UFO incident. However, Boyle did not describe his green Martian as \\"small\\". In 1951, a science fiction book titled \\"The Case of the Little Green Men\\" was published by Mack Reynolds, telling of a private detective hired to investigate disguised aliens living among the human population. As he was being hired, the detective referred derisively and familiarly to the aliens in the flying saucers being \\"little green men\\". The cover illustration is notable for depicting the LGM with the classic antennae sticking out of the head. Mack Reynolds would go on to write the first Star Trek novel in 1968 (Mission to Horatius).Cover illustration;Excerpt of book & author background By early 1950, stories began circulating in newspapers about little beings being recovered from flying saucer crashes. Though largely considered to be hoaxes, some of the stories from the sources about little aliens eventually made it into the popular 1950 book Behind the Flying Saucers by Variety magazine columnist Frank Scully.Scifipedia: Behind the Flying Saucers A witness reporting a flying saucer sighting to a Wichita, Kansas newspaper in June 1950 stated that he saw \\"absolutely no little green men with egg on their whiskers\\".Wichita Eagle, June 30, 1950, reproduced in USAF Project Blue Book report Similarly, electronic searches show that \\"little green men\\" was specifically used in reference to science fiction and flying saucers by at least 1951 in the New York Times and Washington Post (in the Post, a book review of a mystery/science fiction novel called The Little Green Man), and 1952 in the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune (the Tribune mocking flying saucer reports using a \\"little green man with pink polka dots\\"). The next example of the New York Times using the term dates from 1955 in a book review of a sci-fi satire called Martians, Go Home. The Martians were obnoxious \\"little green men\\" whose appearance was \\"true to prophecy\\". In a later example, following a nationally publicized flurry of UFO sightings in November 1957, syndicated Washington columnist Frederick Othman wrote: \\"New Flying Saucer Epidemic On. All over this land again are flying saucers ... No little green men have climbed out of these celestial vehicles so far, but in another couple of days I wouldn't be surprised ...\\"Example column in Austin (Texas) Statesman, November 9, 1957; referenced at Ufoupdates ==Origins and other uses== The term also shows up much earlier in other contexts. Movie gossip columnist Hedda Hopper used it in 1939 referring to small cast members of the Wizard of Oz, and admonished against drinking on the set. In 1942, the Los Angeles Times used the term in a pictorial on Marines training for jungle combat. In this case, \\"little green men\\" referred to camouflaged Japanese soldiers. The Washington Post in 1942 likewise used the term \\"little green man\\" in reference to a camouflaged Japanese sniper who nearly killed one of their war correspondents. Before its more modern application to aliens, little green men was commonly used to describe various supernatural beings in old legends and folklore and in later fairy tales and children's books such as goblins. Aubeck noted several examples of the latter in 19th and early 20th century literature. As an example, Rudyard Kipling had a \\"little green man\\" in Puck of Pook's Hill from 1906. Another example, and the earliest use of little green man in the New York Times and Chicago Tribune, dates from 1902, in a review of a children's book called The Gift of the Magic Staff, where a supernatural \\"Little Green Man\\" is a boy's friend and helps him visit the cloudland fairies. The next use in the New York Times was in 1950, and references a planned movie by Walt Disney Corporation of a 1927 novel by poet/novelist Robert Nathan called The Woodcutter's House. The only animated character in the picture was to be Nathan's \\"Little Green Man\\", a confidant of the woodland animals. (The movie was never made.) In 1923, a serialized romance, When Hearts Command by Elizabeth York Miller, which appeared in newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune and Washington Post, has a former mental patient who still sees \\"little green men\\" and who simultaneously comments that a fellow patient \\"conversed with the inhabitants of Mars\\". Other instances of imaginary small green beings have been found in a newspaper column from 1936 sarcastically discussing doctors and their medical advice, saying these are the same people who have breakdowns in middle age and start hallucinating \\"a little green man with big ears\\". Syndicated columnist Sydney J. Harris used \\"little green man\\" in 1948 as a child's imaginary friend while condemning the age-old tradition of frightening children with stories of \\"boogeymen\\". These examples illustrate that use of little green men was already deeply engrained in English vernacular long before the flying saucer era, used for a variety of supernatural, imaginary, or mythical beings. It also seems to have easily extended beyond the imaginary to real people, such as the reference to small actors in the Wizard of Oz or camouflaged Japanese soldiers. Similarly, Aubeck and others suspect that when flying saucers came along in 1947, with subsequent speculation about alien origins, the term naturally and quickly attached itself to the modern age equivalent. It is also clear that by the early 1950s, the term was already commonly used as a sarcastic reference to the occupants of flying saucers. By 1954, the image of little green men had become inscribed in the public's collective consciousness. Further electronic searches suggest that the term became increasingly more common in the 1960s and always used in a derisive or humorous way. The Chicago Tribune in 1960 carried a front-page story on the speculations of a Harvard anthropologist about how aliens might look and alien sex. The article opens with the comment, \\"If there really are 'little green men' out there in space, there are probably also little green women‚Äìand sex.\\" A cartoon was attached showing two amorous centaur-like male and female aliens with antennae sticking out of their heads. The article also enigmatically states, \\"The 'little green men' designation came from Dr. Otto Struve, director of the national radio astronomy observatory, Green Bank, W. Va. He said that's what the possible outerspacers are called 'among themselves'.\\" The term even penetrated into the commentary of the Wall Street Journal. First use in the Journal was 1960 in an article on the Brookings Report commissioned by NASA, studying the possible social effects of the discovery of extraterrestrial life. The Journal commented that they thought the report overly pessimistic, assuming that \\"the little green men with the wiggly antennae\\" would be hostile. Another Journal use of the term occurred in 1968 in an editorial on a planned Congressional investigation of UFOs. The writer sarcastically asked how they planned to subpoena \\"a little green man\\". In 1969, they commented that the Condon Committee UFO study commissioned by the Air Force was a waste of money. The editorial stated that even if they did prove that \\"UFOs were people with little green men\\", what were we supposed to do about it? By 1965, a little green man had even appeared in The Flintstones as a recurring character. The Great Gazoo (introduced in Episode 145) typified the representation of a little green man with his short, green stature and helmet with antennae. However, the 1960s also marked a transition in the way people imagined a stereotypical alien. In alien abduction stories they are often small but grey beings and in Arthur C. Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) they are unseen. ==Current usage== ===Aliens=== Little green aliens and the term \\"little green men\\" have fallen out of general use in serious science fiction circles and are most commonly used to ridicule the notion that aliens may exist, with a few exceptions, such as Yoda in the Star Wars movie saga. A derisive usage can be seen in the original Star Trek episode \\"Tomorrow Is Yesterday\\", set in 1969, as Captain Kirk, captured by the US Air Force while attempting to steal film showing the Enterprise in Earth's atmosphere, calls himself a \\"little green man from Alpha Centauri\\" when interrogated by the base security officer. Earlier in the same episode, a rescued Air Force captain brought aboard the Enterprise tells Kirk he's never believed in little green men, immediately before meeting the obviously alien Mr. Spock (who replies, \\"Neither have I\\"). In the 1988 Doctor Who serial Remembrance of the Daleks, the line is parodied when the Doctor states that the Daleks are aliens. Group Captain Gilmore asks if he's fighting little green men, to which the Doctor says \\"no, little green blobs in bonded polycarbide armour\\". Instead, the little green alien image seems to have migrated mainly to the world of children's media where it can still be found in abundance (e.g. the small, green \\"squeeze toy aliens\\" in the 1995 film Toy Story and its sequels). The Pok√©mon species \\"Elgyem\\" is based on little green men (\\"LGM\\") in its design, characteristics, and name. The Irkens from Invader Zim bear a similarity to green little men. In the space-simulation game Kerbal Space Program, Kerbals are the only species in the game and are portrayed as little green men with a large head compared to their bodies. ===\\"Unidentified defending objects\\"=== The uniformed \\"local self-defence\\" forces, equipped with camouflage and modern Russian weaponry but lacking identifying badges or insignia, operating during the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine were also called \\"martians\\" or \\"little green men\\" by the locals and the media. ==Astronomy== In 1967, Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Antony Hewish of the University of Cambridge, UK dubbed the first discovered pulsar LGM-1 for \\"little green men\\" because the regular oscillations of its signal suggested a possible intelligent origin. Its designation was later changed to CP 1919, and is now known as PSR B1919+21. ==See also== * Bug-eyed monster * Extraterrestrial life * Fairies * Green Man (folklore and ornamentation) * Grey alien * Irkens * Jinn * Leprechaun * List of alleged extraterrestrial beings * Men in Black * Nordic aliens * Reptilians * The Awful Green Things from Outer Space ==References== ==Further reading== * Karyl, Anna The Kelly Incident, 2004, * Roth, Christopher F.

He was sentenced to a total of 25 years in jail but was released early under the terms of the Belfast Agreement, and became a member of Sinn F√©in. Prior to an 18-year conviction for possessing a rifle, he also spent time on remand for a variety of charges and in total served 20 years in prison. He also played a key role in the Maze Prison escape, the biggest prison break in British penal history. ==Early life== The family was originally from the Marrowbone area, on the Oldpark Road in North Belfast. The family had to move when Storey was very young due to Ulster loyalist attacks on the district, moving to Manor Street, an interface area also in North Belfast. Storey's uncle was boxing trainer Gerry Storey and his father, also called Bobby, was involved in the defence of the area in the 1970s when Catholics were threatened by loyalists. Storey was one of four children. He had two brothers, Seamus and Brian, and a sister Geraldine. Seamus and Bobby senior had been arrested after a raid on their home which uncovered a rifle and a pistol. Bobby senior was later released but Seamus was charged. Seamus escaped from Crumlin Road Prison with eight other prisoners in 1971, they were dubbed the Crumlin Kangaroos. On his mother Peggy's side of the family there was also a history of republicanism, but Storey, according to An Phoblacht, said \\"the dominant influences on\\" him \\"were the events that were happening around\\" him. These included the McGurk's Bar bombing in the New Lodge, some of those killed being people who knew his family, and also Bloody Sunday. This then led to his attempts to join the IRA. Storey left school when he was fifteen and went to work with his father selling fruit. At sixteen, he became a member of the IRA. ==Prison== On 11 April 1973, his seventeenth birthday, he was interned and held in Long Kesh until May 1975. He had been arrested 20 times previous to this but was too young for internment. He was held at Long Kesh internment camp, and in October 1974 took part in the protest against living conditions where internees set fire to the \\"cages\\" in which they were being held. He was released from internment in mid-1975. He was arrested on suspicion of a bombing at the Skyways Hotel in January 1976 and a kidnapping and murder in the Andersonstown district of Belfast in March 1976, but was acquitted by the judge at his trial. He was arrested leaving the courthouse and charged with a shooting-related incident. He was released after the case could not be proved, only to be charged with shooting two soldiers in Turf Lodge. Those charges were dropped in December 1977. The same month he was arrested for the murder of a soldier in Turf Lodge, but the charges were also dropped. In 1978 he was charged in relation to the wounding of a soldier in Lenadoon, but was acquitted at trial due to errors in police procedure. On 14 December 1979 Storey was later arrested in Holland Park, London, with three other IRA volunteers included Gerard Tuite, and charged with conspiring to hijack a helicopter to help Brian Keenan escape from Brixton Prison. Tuite escaped from the same prison prior to the trial, and the other two IRA volunteers were convicted, but Storey was acquitted at the Old Bailey in April 1981. That August, after a soldier was shot, he was arrested in possession of a rifle and was convicted for the first time, being sentenced to eighteen years' imprisonment. Storey was one of the leaders of the Maze Prison escape in 1983, when 38 republican prisoners broke out of the H-Blocks, the largest prison escape in British penal history and the largest peacetime prison escape in Europe. He was recaptured within an hour, and sentenced to an additional seven years imprisonment. Released in 1994, he was again arrested in 1996 and charged with having personal information about a British Army soldier, and Brian Hutton, the Lord Chief Justice. At his trial at Crumlin Road Courthouse in 1998, he was acquitted after his defence proved the personal information had previously been published in books and newspapers. ==Post-prison== Having spent over twenty years in prison, much of it on remand, his final release came in 1998, and he again became involved in developing republican politics and strategy, eventually becoming the northern chairman of Sinn F√©in. On 11 January 2005 Ulster Unionist Member of Parliament for South Antrim David Burnside told the British House of Commons under parliamentary privilege that Storey was head of intelligence for the IRA. On 9 September 2015, Storey was arrested and held for two days in connection with the killing of former IRA volunteer Kevin McGuigan the previous month. He was subsequently released without any charges, and his solicitor John Finucane stated Storey would be suing for unlawful arrest. ==Death== Storey died in England on 21 June 2020 following an unsuccessful lung transplant surgery. Sinn F√©in president Mary Lou McDonald described him as \\"a great republican\\" in her tribute. His funeral procession in Belfast on 30 June was attended by over 1,500 people including McDonald, deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, and former Sinn F√©in president Gerry Adams, but was criticised for breaking COVID-19 social distancing guidelines which, at the time operating in Northern Ireland, limited funeral numbers to no more than 30 mourners. ==Cultural references== In the 2017 film Maze dramatising the 1983 prison break, directed by Stephen Burke, Storey was portrayed by Irish actor Cillian O'Sullivan. ==References== ==External links== *The Trouble with Guns ‚Äì journalist Malachi O'Doherty's account of a meeting with Storey in 1995 Category:Escapees from British detention Category:Irish escapees Category:Irish republicans Category:1956 births Category:2020 deaths Category:People acquitted of murder Category:People from Belfast Category:Place of birth missing Category:Provisional Irish Republican Army members Category:Republicans imprisoned during the Northern Ireland conflict ","title":"Bobby Storey"},{"id":"1435901","text":"Rockair was a United States sounding rocket designed for launch from an airplane, which was tested 1955.

The building was constructed in the latter half of the 19th century and serves the surrounding neighbourhoods. Additionally, St. Bartholomew's is, due to its location next to Rideau Hall, the place of worship for various Governors General of Canada (whether or not of the Anglican faith) and some members of the Canadian Royal Family. It is also the regimental chapel of the Governor General's Foot Guards. ==The church== St. Bartholomew's is located on MacKay Street, in the New Edinburgh neighbourhood of Ottawa, and serves, besides New Edinburgh, Rockcliffe Park, Lindenlea, and Ottawa. Across the street from St. Bartholomew's is Rideau Hall, the official residence of the Canadian monarch and Governor General of Canada. A viceregal pew is reserved for the governor general and his or her family‚Äîthe most recent governor general to have used the pew regularly was Adrienne Clarkson. Additionally, St. Bartholomew's is the regimental chapel of the Governor General's Foot Guards and has thus become known as the Guard's Chapel. The Ottawa Window, a three-light window designed by Wilhelmina Geddes as a war memorial, was presented on Sunday, 9 November 1919, by Governor General Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, in memory of the members of his staff who died during the First World War. An inscribed photograph of Lieutenant-Colonel Farquhar and Captain Buller is displayed on the wall by the entrance to the Church from the parish hall. Other stained glass windows include one by Rosemary Kilbourn. The church also has a relationship with the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI).

A regimental plaque, presented in November 1980, is located on the Patricia Pew. ==History== With the motivational and financial backing of Governor General the Viscount Monck, the parish was founded on 14 August (St. Bartholomew's Day) 1867. Land was donated from the estate of Thomas McKay (the former owner of Rideau Hall) and the St. Lawrence Railway and the building, completed in 1868, was designed by Thomas Seaton Scott, who was the architect of a number of other prominent Ottawa structures. Monck laid the corner stone on 9 May 1868 and the first service was held on Christmas Day, though the interiors remained unfinished. The furnishings were later augmented by the Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava. People who have preached or performed at St. Bartholomew's include Charles Kingsley on Easter Day, 1874, and Dame Nellie Melba in December 1915. Four years later, Prince Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), dedicated the Connaught Window, memorialising his great-uncle, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. ==See also== * List of designated heritage properties in Ottawa ==References== ==External links== * St. Bartholomew's Church * Stained Glass at St. Bartholomew's Church Category:Anglican church buildings in Ottawa Bartholomew's Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in Canada Category:Designated heritage properties in Ottawa ","title":"St. Bartholomew's Anglican Church (Ottawa)"},{"id":"1435937","text":"Jenny Saville (born 7 May 1970) is a contemporary British painter and an original member of the Young British Artists.Royal Academy of Arts: Jenny Saville RA  Artist  Royal Academy of Arts, accessdate: 29 August 2014 She is known for her large-scale painted depictions of nude women. Saville has been credited with originating a new and challenging method of painting the female nude and reinventing figure painting for contemporary art. Saville works and lives in Oxford, England. On 5 October 2018 Saville's Propped (1992) sold at Sothebys' in London for ¬£9.5 million, above its ¬£3-¬£4 million estimate, around $12.4 million US dollars, becoming the most expensive work by a living female artist sold at auction. ==Early life and education == Saville was born on 7 May 1970 in Cambridge, England. Saville went to the Lilley and Stone School (now The Newark Academy) in Newark, Nottinghamshire, for her secondary education, later gaining her degree at Glasgow School of Art (1988‚Äì1992), and was then awarded a six-month scholarship to the University of Cincinnati where she enrolled in a course in women's studies. Saville was exposed to gender political ideas and renowned feminist writers. Saville states that during her time in Cincinnati, she saw \\"Lots of big women. Big white flesh in shorts and T-shirts. It was good to see because they had the physicality that I was interested in\\" ‚Äì a physicality that she partially credits to Pablo Picasso, an artist that she sees as a painter that made subjects as if \\"they were solidly there...not fleeting.\\".\\"Jenny Saville Biography \\". Artbank.com. Retrieved on 5 February 2008. ==Career== At the end of Saville's postgraduate education, the leading British art collector, Charles Saatchi, purchased her senior show. He offered the artist an 18-month contract, supporting her while she created new works to be exhibited in the Saatchi Gallery in London. The collection, Young British Artists III, exhibited in 1994 with Saville's self-portrait, Plan (1993), as the signature piece.\\"SAVILLE, Jenny.\\" Benezit Dictionary of Artists. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 24 September 2015. . Rising quickly to critical and public recognition and emerging as part of the Young British Artists (YBA) scene, Saville has been noted for creating art through the use of a classical standard‚Äîfigure painting, but with a contemporary approach. Since her debut in 1992, Saville's focus has remained on the female body. She has stated, \\"I'm drawn to bodies that emanate a sort of state of in-betweeness: hermaphrodite, a transvestite, a carcass, a half- alive/half-dead head.\\". In 1994, Saville spent many hours observing plastic surgery operations in New York City. Her published sketches and documents include surgical photographs of liposuction, trauma victims, deformity correction, disease states, and transgender patients.Schama, Simon. \\"Jenny Saville\\". The Saatchi Gallery, 2005. Retrieved on 6 February 2008. Much of her work features distorted flesh, high-caliber brush strokes, and patches of oil color, while others reveal the surgeon's mark of a plastic surgery operation or white \\"target\\" rings. Her paintings are usually much larger than life-size. They are strongly pigmented and give a highly sensual impression of the surface of the skin as well as the mass of the body. Saville's post-painterly style has been compared to that of Lucian Freud and Rubens. === Album Covers === In 1994, Saville's painting Strategy (South Face/Front Face/North Face) appeared on the cover of Manic Street Preachers' third album The Holy Bible.Middles, Mick. \\"Manic Street Preachers\\". London: Omnibus Press, January 2000. p.136. Saville's painting, Stare (2005), was used for the cover of the Manics' 2009 album Journal for Plague Lovers.Rogers, Georgie & O'Doherty, Lucy. \\"Supermarkets cover up Manics CD \\". BBC News, 2009. Retrieved on 28 June 2009. The top four UK supermarkets stocked the CD in a plain slipcase, after the cover was deemed \\"inappropriate\\". The band's James Dean Bradfield said the decision was \\"utterly bizarre\\", and commented: The album cover art placed second in a 2009 poll for Best Art Vinyl. === Recent Work === In 2002, she collaborated with photographer Glen Luchford to produce huge Polaroids of herself taken from below, lying on a sheet of glass. In Saville's more recent work, she employs graphite, charcoal, and pastel to explore overlapping forms suggestive of underdrawings, movement, hybridity, and gender ambiguity. Saville states, \\"If I draw through previous bodily forms in an arbitrary or contradictory way...it gives the work a kind of life force or eros. Destruction, regeneration, a cyclic rhythm of emerging forms...\\" ==Representations of the body== Representations of the body is an important aspect of Jenny Saville's work. Saville's stylized nude portraits of voluminous female bodies have brought her international acclaim. She attributes most of her style and subjects to this theme of representations. Savilles' work Propped (1992), which is the most expensive work sold at an auction house by a living female artist, has been described as \\"one of the undisputed masterpieces of the Young British Artists\\" by Sothebys' European head of Contemporary Art, Alex Branczik. This piece is said to be so masterful because it is \\"the superlative self-portrait that shatters canonized representations of female beauty.\\" In an interview for the Saatchi Gallery, Saville comments \\"I have to really work at the tension between getting the paint to have the sensory quality that I want and be constructive in terms of building the form of a stomach, for example, or creating the inner crevice of a thigh. The more I do it, the more the space between abstraction and figuration becomes interesting. I want a painting realism. I try to consider the pace of a painting, of active and quiet areas. Listening to music helps a lot, especially music where there‚Äôs a hard sound and then soft breathable passages.\\" === Technique and color choices === Saville's technique uses small brushstrokes to build up the painting and soften the imaging. The finish of the painting is matte, but it does not look \\"dry\\".Robinson, Hilary, \\"Approaching Painting through Feminine Morphology\\", \\"Paragraph 25, no. 3\\", 2002 She also uses interesting, muted color combinations for her art pieces that create a soft atmosphere free of harshness with an intense subject and meaning behind it. Other complementary analyzes have been proposed on the technique: While drawing upon a wide range of sources it is normal that a painting \\"capture a sense of motion and fluidity. These restless images provide no fixed point, but rather suggest the perception of simultaneous realities\\". Kenny Smith.Kenny Smith (26 March 2018), Jenny Saville‚Äôs work is put in the frame in Scotland Scottish Field. \\"She found a way to niche gender studies within a late flowering of the grand tradition of the swagger portrait‚Ä¶ Saville‚Äôs provocative twist was to extend the bravura technique and monumental scale of such painting to naked and isolated (or in some cases sardined) young women\\". David Cohen.David Cohen (6 October 2011), The Dutchmen‚Äôs Heir: Jenny Saville at Gagosian Art Critical. Saville works with oil paint, applied in heavy layers, becomes as visceral as flesh itself, each painted mark maintaining a supple, mobile life of its own. As Saville pushes, smears, and scrapes the pigment over her large-scale canvases. Saville is also known for her use of massive canvases that allow the viewer to see the details and layering of oil paints to create her signature aesthetic of movement and abstract realism. === Aesthetics and subject matter === Traditionally, Jenny Saville's nudes have been studied from the gender perspective defying \\"the traditional aspects of beauty and femininity. In fact, most of her nudes represent overweight or bruised women‚Ä¶ constant struggle between the female body and the body ideals contemporary pop culture has been trying to force upon it\\". Marilia Kaisar.Marilia Kaisar (21 May 2018), An analysis of the feminist nude through the work of Jenny Saville Medium. Meagher writes that Saville sees standards of \\"beauty and pleasure [as] deeply embedded within Western [culture]\\", yet, she constantly tries to challenge these assumptions of the body and beauty.Meagher, Michelle, \\"Jenny Saville and a Feminist Aesthetics of Disgust.\\" \\"Hypatia 18, no. 4\\", 2003 Her nonconventional looks at beauty expands the traditional nude form into a way to comment on the body, gender politics, sexuality, and even self-realization. Her works often \\"depict distorted, fleshy, and disquieting female bodies\\" to provoke interest, confusion, questions, and excitement. Saville‚Äôs luscious yet grotesque treatment of painted bodies have elicited comparisons to Lucian Freud. ‚ÄúI paint flesh because I‚Äôm human,‚Äù she has said. ‚ÄúIf you work in oil, as I do, it comes naturally. Flesh is just the most beautiful thing to paint.‚Äù\\"A confrontation with the dynamics of exposure‚Ä¶ her exaggerated nudes point up, with an agonizing frankness, the disparity between the way women are perceived and the way that they feel about their bodies\\" Suzie Mackenzie.Suzie Mackenzie (22 October 2005), Under the skin The Guardian. She plays upon the \\"ambiguity of embodiment\\" and what it means to be \\"feminine\\" or \\"beautiful\\" through the use of the distortion and \\"disgust\\". This \\"aesthetic of disgust\\" pushed people to the uncomfortable and forced many into the shoes of countless women in the Western world, giving some the autonomy to decide their own standard of beauty beyond society. The primary subject of all of Saville‚Äôs early works is the artist herself, and indeed throughout her oeuvre she has almost exclusively painted female subjects. Scholars like Loren Erdrich argue there is a direct link between the physical body, identity, and the self presented within Saville's subjects.Erdrich, Loren, \\"I Am a Monster: The Indefinite and the Malleable in Contemporary Female Self-Portraiture\\", Circa, no. 121, 2007, doi:10.2307/25564831. Society shapes and seeks to control behavior, relationships, and power. Saville, however, breaks down the social conventions that encourage women to fit into limiting beauty standards. Saville's subject, non-idealized bodies, have been understood as superposition of mental and emotional mindsets: \\"if we could see through our skins our psychological injuries, then the process will be clear: every injury and excess is hiding from the surface (in every successfully avoided blushing) it goes to our inner body (where it avoids to be noticed)‚Äù Luis Alberto Mejia Clavijo.Luis Alberto Mejia Clavijo (29 May 2013), Jenny Saville: Individual external bruises of collective internal injuries Contemporary Art Theory. Through the mediation of paint, Saville restores beauty and subjectivity to bodies that have been in what is seen as grotesque. In her own words: \\"A lot of women out there look and feel like that, made to fear their own excess, taken in by the cult of exercise, the great quest to be thin. The rhetoric used against obesity makes it sound far worse than alcohol or smoking, yet they can do you far more damage\\". Jenny Saville.Hunter Davies (1 March 1994), This is Jenny and this is her plan Independent. It is acknowledged that Saville performs \\"explorations of people that are both intimate and uncomfortable. Through detailed, frank and unapologetic investigations of the human body, dialogues occur between past and present, and are animated by questions of gender, suffering, and ambiguity\\". Asana Greenstreet.Asana Greenstreet (3 July 2012), Jenny Saville at Modern Art Oxford Aesthetica Magazine. From the beginning of her career, Saville has engaged in an intense exploration of the body and its representation. Saville borrows conventions from a long tradition in figure painting, whether in poses borrowed from Madonna and Child paintings by Leonardo da Vinci, the use of a color palette reminiscent of Peter Paul Rubens, or the gestural painting of Willem de Kooning in his Woman series. Saville appropriates these techniques associated with male masters to show her own point of view as a woman. In 2004, Saville explored the idea of floating gender in her work Passage. Saville is quoted saying \\"With the transvestite I was searching for a body that was between genders. I had explored that idea a little in Matrix. The idea of floating gender that is not fixed. The transvestite I worked with has a natural penis and false silicone breasts. Thirty or forty years ago this body couldn‚Äôt have existed and I was looking for a kind of contemporary architecture of the body. I wanted to paint a visual passage through gender ‚Äì a sort of gender landscape.\\" ==Select works== *Branded (1992). Oil painting on a canvas. In this painting, Saville painted her own face onto an obese female body. The size of the breasts and midsection is very exaggerated. The figure in the painting is holding folds of her skin which she is seemingly showing off. *Plan (1993). Oil painting on a canvas. This painting depicts a nude female figure with contour lines marked on her body, much like that of a topographical map. Saville said of this work: \\"The lines on her body are the marks they make before you have liposuction done to you. They draw these things that look like targets. I like this idea of mapping of the body, not necessarily areas to be cut away, but like geographical contours on a map. I didn't draw on to the body. I wanted the idea of cutting into the paint. Like you would cut into the body.... It evokes the idea of surgery. It has lots of connotations.\\" *Fulcrum (1999). Oil painting on an canvas. In this painting, three obese women are piled on a medical trolley. Thin vertical strips of tape have been painted over and then pulled off the canvas, thus creating a sense of geometric measure at odds with the mountainous flesh. *Hem (1999). Oil painting on a canvas. This painting depicts a very large nude female with lots of subtle textures implied. The bits of orange showing through the stomach add a glow, while the figure's left side is covered with thick white paint as if by a plaster cast, and her pubic area, painted pink over dark brown, resembles carved painted wood. *Hybrid (1997). Oil painting on a canvas. In this painting, the image looks much like patchwork. Different components of four female bodies are incorporated together to create a unique piece. *Ruben's Flap (1998‚Äì1999). Oil painting on a canvas. This painting depicts Saville herself; she multiplies her body, letting it fill the canvas space as it does in other works, but what is interesting is the fragmentation. Decisive lines divide the body into square planes, and it appears that she is trying to hide the nakedness with the different planes. Saville seems to be struggling to convince herself that the parts of her body are beautiful. *Matrix (1999). Oil painting on a canvas. In this painting, Saville depicts a reclining nude figure with female breasts and genitalia, but with a masculine, bearded face. The genitalia is thrust to the foreground, making it much more of a focus in the picture than the gaze. The arms and legs of the figure are only partly seen, the extremities lying outside the boundary of the picture. The whole is painted in fairly naturalistic fleshy tones. *Saville also created a series of photographs known as Closed Contact (1995‚Äì1996). She collaborated with artist Glen Luchford to create a series of C-prints depicting a larger female nude lying on plexiglass. The photos were taken from underneath the glass and depict the female figure very distorted. ==Exhibitions== * In 1993, Cooling Gallery, London, UK (when Saatchi bought all her works). *In 1994, \\"Young British Artists III\\", Saatchi Gallery, London, UK. *In 1996, \\"Contemporary British Art '96\\", Museum of Kalmar, Stockholm, Sweden. * In 1996, \\"A Collaboration\\", in collaboration with Glen Luchford, Pace/McGill Gallery, New York, US. *In 1997, 'Sensation', Royal Academy of Art, London, UK (brought Saville's work to the attention of the British public at large). * In 1999, \\"Territories\\", Gagosian Gallery, New York (SoHo), US.

Carried out on 20 December 2004, a gang seized the equivalent of ¬£26.5 million in pounds sterling and small amounts of other currencies, largely euros and US dollars, making it the largest bank robbery in British history. Although the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and the British and Irish governments claimed the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) was responsible (or had permitted others to undertake the raid), this is denied by the Provisional IRA and the political party Sinn F√©in. Although one person has been convicted of money laundering, the investigation is still ongoing, and the case remains unsolved. ==Details of the raid== On the night of Sunday 19 December 2004, groups of armed men arrived at the homes of two officials of the Northern Bank, one in Downpatrick in County Down, the other in Poleglass, in West Belfast. Masquerading as Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officers, they entered the homes and held the officials and their families at gunpoint. Bank official Christopher Ward was taken from Poleglass to Downpatrick, the home of his supervisor, Kevin McMullan, while gunmen remained at his home with Ward's family. Subsequently, McMullan's wife was taken from their home and held, also at gunpoint, at an unknown location. The following day both officials were instructed to report for work at the bank's headquarters at Belfast's Donegall Square West as normal. At lunch time on Monday, 20 December 2004, Ward removed a sum of money thought to be around ¬£1 million and placed it in a sports holdall. He walked out of the bank's Wellington Street staff entrance with the holdall and made his way to a bus stop in Queen Street where he met up with one of the robbers. This action was later released as a closed circuit video presentation. After handing over the sports holdall with the stolen money, Ward returned to his work location. This was regarded as a test run for the main heist later in the evening. McMullan and Ward remained at work after the close of business, and later in the evening they gave entry to other members of the gang. The robbers entered the bank via the Wellington Street staff entrance and made their way to the bank's cash handling and storage facility. This held an unusually large amount of cash in preparation for distribution to automated teller machines for the busy Christmas shopping season. Cash was transferred to one or several vehicles parked outside in Wellington Street. The gang then fled. Shortly before midnight the gang holding the Ward family left, and those holding Mrs McMullan released her in a forest near Ballynahinch. The haul included ¬£10 million of uncirculated Northern Bank sterling banknotes, ¬£5.5 million of used Northern Bank sterling notes, ¬£4.5 million of circulated sterling notes issued by other banks, and small amounts of other currencies, largely euros and US dollars. Following the raid, Northern Bank announced that it would recall all ¬£300 million worth of its banknotes in denominations of ¬£10 or more, and reissue them in different colours with a new logo and new serial numbers. The first of these new notes entered circulation on 11 March 2005. ==Initial responses== Although the police initially refused to be drawn as to who might be involved, a number of commentators, including journalist Kevin Myers writing in the Daily Telegraph, quickly blamed the Provisional IRA, saying that only it had the wherewithal to conduct such a professional operation in the province. One senior police officer quoted in The Guardian newspaper said: \\"This operation required great expertise and coordination, probably more than the loyalist gangs possess\\". Investigations were conducted by the Police Service of Northern Ireland. On 7 January 2005 Hugh Orde, the service's Chief Constable, issued an interim report in which he blamed the Provisional IRA for the robbery. The British and Irish governments concurred with Orde's assessment, as did the Independent Monitoring Commission (the body appointed by the Irish and British governments to oversee the Northern Ireland ceasefires). Sinn F√©in, however, denied the Chief Constable's claim, saying the IRA had not conducted the raid and that Sinn F√©in officials had not known of or sanctioned the robbery. Martin McGuinness said that Orde's accusation represented \\"nothing more than biased allegations. This is more to do with halting the process of change which Sinn F√©in has been driving forward than with anything that happened at the Northern Bank\\". Bertie Ahern, the Irish Taoiseach, on the other hand, said that \\"an operation of this magnitude had obviously been planned at a stage when I was in negotiations with those that would know the leadership of the Provisional movement.\\" On 18 January 2005 the Provisional IRA issued a two-line statement denying any involvement in the robbery: \\"The IRA has been accused of involvement in the recent Northern Bank robbery. We were not involved\\". Despite this denial of involvement from the Provisional IRA and others by its supporters, it has been widely believed in Northern Ireland, especially in unionist and loyalist circles, that the raid was the work of the IRA,Burning Bush ‚Äì Sinn Fein ‚Äì totally unfitted for government in Northern Ireland! and intended by them as a means of securing a pension fund for its active service members since the promulgation of the Good Friday Agreement. ==Arrests and investigation developments== ===10 February 2005=== On 10 February the houses of Liam and Michael Donnelly were searched in connection with the robbery but nothing was found on the business premises either. ===17 February=== On 17 February the Garda√≠ announced it had arrested seven people and recovered over ¬£2 million, including ¬£60,000 in Northern Bank notes, during raids in the Cork and Dublin areas, as part of ongoing investigations into money laundering. The Garda√≠ did not officially confirm that the raids were related to the Northern Bank robbery, but made the arrests under the Offences against the State Act, the republic's chief anti-terrorism law. Those arrested are reported to include several men from Derry and a former Sinn F√©in councillor. A suspected IRA member was arrested at Heuston Station, along with two others. Money to the sum of ‚Ç¨94,000 was found in their vehicle, in a washing powder box. One of the men, Don Bullman from Co. Cork, was charged on 18 February at the Special Criminal Court with IRA membership. He was jailed for IRA membership but never charged in connection with the Northern Bank robbery. ===18 February=== On 18 February, Garda√≠ in Passage West arrested a man found to be attempting to burn sterling banknotes. Two men in Dublin were released from questioning, as was the Sinn F√©in member in Cork. A top Irish businessman and associate of the Taoiseach, Phil Flynn, stepped down from a number of positions pending the outcome of a Garda√≠ investigation into Chesterton Finance, of which he is a non-executive director. He stepped down as chairman of a government body overseeing decentralisation, as well as giving up a position on the board of VHI and as chairman of the Bank of Scotland (Ireland). The PSNI recovered ¬£50,000 in unused Northern banknotes at Newforge Country Club, a sports and social club in Belfast for off-duty and retired police officers, owned by the PSNI's Athletic Association. The PSNI stated it was a diversion, but it is being investigated. ===19 February=== Police confirm the money found at the Newforge Country Club was part of the ¬£26 million from the bank robbery. ===October 2005=== On 12 October, Garda Commissioner Noel Conroy told a law enforcement conference in Dublin that he was satisfied that the money recovered in Cork in February came from the Northern Bank robbery. ===November 2005=== On 2 November the PSNI arrested two men in Kilcoo, County Down, as part of a pre-planned operation in connection with the robbery. Sinn F√©in's Willie Clarke says that the two arrested are not members of his party. On 3 November three more people were arrested in Belfast, Dungannon and Coalisland, bringing the total number of people arrested during the operation to five. All five were questioned in the PSNI's Serious Crime Suite in Antrim police station. It was reported that in the early hours of the morning, crowds blocked the road between Castlewellan and Newry near Kilcoo with burnt-out vehicles. Hugh Orde defended the police action as \\"proportionate\\" and gave his full backing to the detectives handling the operation. Sinn F√©in MP Michelle Gildernew claimed the raids were a \\"political stunt\\". One of the five arrested during Tuesday and Wednesday has been released. The individual arrested in Dungannon was named as Brian Arthurs, a member of Sinn F√©in and brother of Declan Arthurs, an IRA volunteer killed in 1987. On 7 November, Martin McAliskey, a 42-year-old man from Coalisland, County Tyrone, was charged with making false statements to police in relation to a white Ford Transit van allegedly used in the robbery. On 29 November police investigating the raid arrested Chris Ward and searched his home. They confirmed that another bank employee, a 23-year-old woman who was not named, was also arrested on the same day. ===December 2005=== On 2 December PSNI raided Casement Park, the Gaelic Athletic Association stadium in Belfast, and the related Social Club. The GAA reported the matter to the Irish government. On 7 December, Chris Ward was charged with the robbery. Belfast Magistrates' Court was told the prosecution case was based on Ward's actions in the days preceding and during the raid, and a suspicious work rota, as well as discrepancies in Ward's original statements to police. Ward denied the charge and claimed police had harassed him and his family in an attempt to frame him. He also complained that he had been held in police custody for an unprecedented eight days under the Criminal Justice Act before being charged. ===3 January 2007=== All charges against Dominic McEvoy and Martin McAliskey are dropped by the Public Prosecution Service. Hugh Orde describes the developments as a setback. Chris Ward is remanded on bail until 31 January, when he will appear before the court again. ===October 2007=== A date of September 2008 was set for the trial of Chris Ward, in connection with the robbery. He is charged with robbery and two further charges of false imprisonment. ===October 2008=== On 9 October 2008, Ward was acquitted of all the charges (robbery and false imprisonment). The judge discharged him after the prosecution said it would be offering no more evidence. The prosecution accepted that a work rota change that was the basis of their case had been \\"the result of a chance decision by management\\". ===March 2009=== On 27 March, financial adviser Ted Cunningham from Cork was found guilty of laundering over three million pounds sterling which came from the robbery. ===May 2012=== On 11 May 2012, the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed the conviction of Ted Cunningham on all ten charges, citing an invalidity of the warrant used to search his house. The invalidity referred to the fact that the warrant was issued by the senior Garda in charge of the investigation, as allowed for by section 29 (1) of the Offences against the State Act, a state of affairs which the Court found to be repugnant to the Constitution of Ireland. The Court ordered a retrial on nine of the ten original counts of money laundering. It directed that the tenth, relating to a sum of money allegedly found in Cunningham's home was not to be retried. ===February 2014=== Ted Cunningham was given a 5-year suspended sentence having pleaded guilty to two counts of money laundering following a four day trial. ==References== * BBC timeline of the robbery * Senator John McCain on Northern Bank robbery * Sinn F√©in leadership and Northern Bank robbery * US Embassy cables on Northern Bank robbery released by Wikileaks ==See also== * City bonds robbery *Portuguese Bank Note Crisis ‚Äì a 1925 crime with comparable political and economic repercussions *List of famous bank robbers and robberies Category:2004 crimes in the United Kingdom Category:2004 in Northern Ireland Category:2000s in Northern Ireland Category:21st century in Belfast Category:Bank robberies Category:Robberies in the United Kingdom Category:Unsolved crimes in the United Kingdom Category:Crime in Belfast Category:December 2004 events in the United Kingdom Category:Organised crime events in the United Kingdom Category:Organised crime in Northern Ireland ","title":"Northern Bank robbery"},{"id":"1435963","text":"Robert Oscar Blood (November 10, 1887 ‚Äì August 3, 1975) was an American physician and Republican politician from Concord, New Hampshire.

The API provides a set of interfaces implemented using the Component Object Model (COM); it is otherwise unrelated to OLE. Microsoft originally intended OLE DB as a higher-level replacement for, and successor to, ODBC, extending its feature set to support a wider variety of non-relational databases, such as object databases and spreadsheets that do not necessarily implement SQL. == Methodology == OLE DB separates the data store from the application that needs access to it through a set of abstractions that include the datasource, session, command, and rowsets. This was done because different applications need access to different types and sources of data, and do not necessarily want to know how to access functionality with technology-specific methods. OLE DB is conceptually divided into consumers and providers. The consumers are the applications that need access to the data, and the providers are the software components that implement the interface and thereby provides the data to the consumer. OLE DB is part of the Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) stack. == Support status == Microsoft's release of SQL Server 2012 (internal code: 'Denali') is the last to include an OLE DB provider for SQL Server, but support will continue for 7 years.Microsoft SQLNCli team blog: Microsoft is Aligning with ODBC for Native Relational Data Access According to a related Microsoft FAQ,SQL Server Forums - SQL Server Data Access: Microsoft is Aligning with ODBC for Native Relational Data Access \\"Providers like ADO.NET which can run on top of OLE DB will not support OLE DB once the latter is deprecated\\", but the same answer in the FAQ states that the original post relates only to the OLE DB provider for SQL Server, so the position of OLE DB itself remains unclear.

OLE DB providers can be created to access such simple data stores as a text file and spreadsheet, through to such complex databases as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase ASE, and many others. It can also provide access to hierarchical data stores such as email systems. However, because different data store technologies can have different capabilities, every OLE DB provider cannot implement every possible interface available in the OLE DB standard. The capabilities that are available are implemented through the use of COM objects; an OLE DB provider will map the data store technologies functionality to a particular COM interface.

The first and second versions of the RS 6 were offered in both Avant and saloon forms. The third and fourth generations are only offered as an Avant. ==Overview== The \\"RS\\" initials are taken from the ‚Äì literally translated as \\"racing sport\\", and is Audi's ultimate 'top- tier' high-performance trim level, positioned a noticeable step above the \\"S\\" model specification level of Audi's regular model range line-up. Like all Audi \\"RS\\" models, the RS 6 pioneers some of Audi's newest and most advanced engineering and technology, and so could be described as a halo vehicle, with the latest RS 6 Performance having the equal most powerful internal combustion engine out of all Audi models, with the same horsepower and torque as the physically larger Audi S8 Plus. Unlike the A6 and S6, however, the RS 6's engines in the C5 and C6 iterations have not been shared with any other vehicle in Audi's lineup. However, for the C7 generation, the Audi RS 6 has the same 4.0L bi-turbo V8 engine as the Audi RS 7, with both being positioned at the top of the Audi S and RS range, and detuned variants of the same engines are found in the Audi S8, Audi A8, and Audi S6. Based on the A6 platform, the RS 6's engines are front-mounted and longitudinally oriented, while the transmission is mounted immediately at the rear of the engine in a longitudinal orientation, in the form of a transaxle. Like all S and RS models, the RS 6 is only available with Audi's 'trademark' Torsen-based quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. The C5 RS 6 was the fourth model to come out of Audi's private subsidiary company, \\"quattro GmbH\\". The first was the Audi RS 2 Avant, from a joint venture between Porsche and Quattro GmbH for the Audi marque. The second was the Audi C4 S6 Plus, produced from April 1996 to July 1997. The third was the 2000 Audi B5 RS 4; the fifth was the 2005 Audi B7 A4 DTM Edition saloon, and the sixth was the 2006 Audi B7 RS 4. The seventh and current () Quattro GmbH model is the latest Audi C6 RS 6. Production of the original Audi C5 RS 6 began in June 2002 and ended in September 2004. The second Audi C6 RS 6 was introduced at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show. The original RS 6 was the first Audi RS variant exported to North America, while the C6 and C7 RS 6 were only sold in Europe Main rivals for the Audi RS 6 are the BMW M5 and Mercedes-Benz E 55/E 63 AMG. ==C5 (Typ 4B, 2002‚Äì2004)== Audi C5 RS 6 quattro saloon Audi C5 RS 6 quattro Avant RS6 interior, showing leather- clad Recaro seats The original Audi C5 RS 6 Quattro (Typ 4B) was the top-of- the-line user of the Volkswagen Group C5 platform (1997‚Äì2004), and was initially available as a five-door five-seat Avant - Audis name for an estate or station wagon. A four-door five-seat saloon/sedan followed shortly after the launch of the Avant. Derived from the Audi C5 S6 (itself derived from the Audi C5 A6), the RS 6 also shares the aluminium structure from the firewall and forward with the C5 A6s with V8 engines (A6 4.2 V8 Quattro, S6 saloon/Avant). It was manufactured from July 2002 through to September 2004. Official performance figures for the Avant, whilst consuming the recommended high octane 98 RON \\"Super Plus\\" unleaded petrol indicate the 0- dash would be completed in 4.6 seconds (s), reaching in 22.8 seconds (22.6 s for the saloon). Official figures state an electronically limited top speed of , although most \\"RS\\" owners report that the speed limiter is rather liberal on all RS cars, with genuine 'limited' top speeds of being possible to achieve. Using a lower octane-rated petrol, such as the standard 95 RON \\"Premium\\" unleaded will reduce the engine power output, and have logical reduction in performance. Luggage capacity, measured according to the VDA block method in the Avant ranges from , to with the rear seats folded down. For the saloon, the boot holds . ===C5 powertrain=== For the C5 RS 6 powertrain detail, the engine is an all-aluminium alloy twin-turbocharged ('biturbo'), double overhead camshaft, 5 valve per cylinder version of Audi's 4.2-litre 90¬∞ V8 petrol engine (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: BCY), developed and manufactured in Germany and the UK by quattro GmbH and Cosworth Technology (now known as MAHLE Powertrain). With the addition of the two turbochargers (one per cylinder bank), the power output of the V8 engine was increased to at 5,700 to 6,400 rpm, and generated of torque. The combination of the 4.2-litre V8, variable inlet valve timing, and twin turbochargers gave the RS 6 an exceptionally wide power band, with peak torque available from 1,950 to 5,600 rpm. Further detail of the engine includes fully sequential electronic multi- point fuel injection with intake manifold-sited fuel injectors,Bosch Automotive Technology Manifold injection: Method of operation mapped direct ignition systemBosch Automotive Technology Ignition with solid-state high voltage distribution using eight individual single-spark ignition coils and NGK longlife spark plugs, and three knock sensors. Engine management uses a Bosch MotronicBosch Automotive Technology Motronic for manifold-injection engines ME 7.1.1 engine control unit, which controls all functions of the engine operation; including fuel delivery, ignition system, valve timing, emissions control systems, and torque reduction control‚Äîthe latter operating in conjunction with the Bosch ESP 5.7 Electronic Stability Programme, as part of the \\"Anti Slip Regulation\\" (ASR) traction control system. The engine is compliant with the European Union Euro3 (EU3) standard, and includes two close-coupled primary catalytic converters (CATs), two underfloor main CATs, and four heated oxygen sensors which manage the cylinder bank selective lambda control. This results in a CO2 emissions rating of 350 g/km for the Avant and saloon in standard configuration. It has an electronically controlled five- speed ZF 5HP24A tiptronic automatic transmission (parts code prefix: 01L, identification code: GAG) (gear ratios‚Äî1st: 3.571, 2nd: 2.200, 3rd: 1.505, 4th: 1.000, 5th: 0.804), with lock-up torque converter in all forward gears. It has \\"hill-detection\\" capability, and despite many press articles stating that the gearbox was programmed to \\"blip\\" the throttle for downshifting gear changes, no UK owners have ever found this feature to be present. The transmission control unit ECU incorporates \\"fuzzy logic\\" with its \\"Dynamic Shift Programme\\" (DSP), with the shift pattern adapting to suit individual driving styles. 'Tiptronic' manual control can be achieved with either the floor-mounted gear shift lever or the steering wheel-mounted 'paddles'. The RS 6 was only available with Audi's Torsen-based Quattro permanent four-wheel drive, utilising the Torsen T-2 dynamic 'automatic torque biasing' (ATB) centre differential (diff), a modified unit which was being used in the 6.0-litre W12-powered Audi D3 A8. The torque from the engine is first routed from the gearbox output shaft to the Torsen centre diff, and then automatically divided and apportioned between the front and rear axles. The front and rear axle differentials (ratio: 3.197, rear axle identification code: GGW) are a conventional \\"open\\" type but utilise an \\"Electronic Differential Lock\\" (EDL). EDL is an integrated additional function of the Bosch Electronic Stability Programme (ESP) system, and works by monitoring and comparing the individual wheel speeds across an axle, and braking an individual wheel which is sensed to have lost traction (spinning), thus transferring torque across the axle to the wheel/tyre which does have grip. \\"Anti-Slip Regulation\\" (ASR), more commonly known as traction control systemBosch Automotive Technology Traction Control System TCS completes the Bosch ESP-related driver aids. ===C5 suspension and steering=== Utilising the same fully independent four-link front suspension, and double wishbone rear, as its related A6 and S6, the RS 6 was lowered by , with a 30% stiffer spring rate, and 40% increased compression damping. The RS6 also served as the debut model for Audi's \\"Dynamic Ride Control\\" (DRC) system. The DRC system is mainly mechanical, and uses a pump to provide additional pressure to individual dampers (shock absorbers) during cornering, acceleration or braking; to counteract rolling and pitching. The system can adjust the stiffness at each individual damper constantly; to maintain both a comfortable ride on straight roads, and a high level of poise and grip when cornering hard, accelerating, or braking. The DRC's main advantage is that it operates without the need for complicated electronics, as required in similar systems from Mercedes-Benz and other competitors. Its main drawback is that the DRC dampers have been known to fail (leaking fluid from the cross-linked circuits), which can affect the handling and ride quality of the vehicle; some owners have reported needing multiple replacements of faulty DRC units and many drivers have opted to replace the system with simpler and more reliable aftermarket coil-over suspension. ===C5 brakes, wheels and tyres=== The front brakes feature fixed Brembo 8-piston monoblock brake calipers, working with radially vented and cross-drilled brake discs, sized at in diameter, by thick. The rear features single-piston floating ATE calipers with integrated cable-operated parking brake mechanism, mated to radially vented disc and cross-drilled, sized by . Front and rear brake calipers are finished in a high-gloss black paint, with the fronts incorporating the Audi \\"RS\\" logo. Both front and rear discs are held in by metal pins to the lightweight disc hub, and allow of lateral thermal expansion from the hub centre. Bosch ESP 5.7 Electronic Stability Programme,Bosch Automotive Technology Electronic Stability Programme ESP with Anti-lock Braking System (ABS),Bosch Automotive Technology Antilock Braking System ABS Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), and Brake Assist (BA) was standard fitment. There were a total of three original equipment manufacturer (OEM) wheel and tyre types available with the RS 6. In Europe and elsewhere, 19-inch wheels were standard, with an optional 18-inch package. In the U.S. market, the 18-inch package was the only available offering. An 18-inch winter package, with Dunlop SP Winter Sport M3 tyres () was universally available. For 18-inch wheels, the standard tyre fitted was with extra load (XL) rating. This is often stressed, and is the only recommendation by Audi, as the RS 6 does weigh . Tyres which are not rated XL are not safe (nor legal, in most countries) for use. Owners reported finding Continental ContiSportContact 2, Dunlop SP Sport 9000, Michelin Pilot Sport PS2, and Pirelli P-Zero Rosso as OEM suppliers for tyres on the RS6. However, according to ETKA, the Dunlop and Pirelli tyres were subsequently withdrawn from the official supply, and the Continental SportContact 2 has been superseded by the SportContact 3\\\\. An additional tyre from Bridgestone has now been included as officially recommended fitment, the Potenza RE050A. For 19-inch wheels, the standard tyre fitted was . as the XL rating achieves a ( load rating). In contrast, the will get you , good for per tyre. Current officially recommended tyres from ETKA for the 19-inch rims only include the Michelin Pilot Sport PS2, Continental ContiSportContact 3 and Vredestein Ultrac Sessanta also 96Y XL. ===C5 RS 6 Plus=== Audi RS6 Plus, showing the 'black optics' and anthracite alloy wheels Between April 2004 and September 2004, there was a final limited run of an even higher-performance RS 6, named the Audi RS 6 Plus. This had an increased engine power output (identification code: BRV), and produced at 6,000-6,400 rpm, with the same of torque at 1,950-6,000 rpm. This engine was also developed and manufactured in the UK by Cosworth Technology (now known as MAHLE Powertrain). The additional performance was achieved with a new engine control unit (ECU), and two additional coolant radiators behind the side- mounted intercoolers (these were standard fitment on the standard RS 6 in hotter climate countries). Official performance figures indicate the discipline of sprinting from standstill to in 4.4 seconds. The RS 6 Plus carries on to reach in 20.36 seconds, and has an official top speed of . The RS 6 Plus came with Dynamic Ride Control (DRC) as standard, and also included a no-cost option of \\"Sports Suspension Plus\\", which lowered the standard sports suspension by a further over the standard RS 6. A revised steering rack, with a reduced ratio of 14.3 for firmer steering feel was included, and resulted in a turning circle of . The brakes now included cross-drilled discs. The wheels were only available in the 9Jx19-inch '5-arm design' alloys, finished in \\"anthracite\\" (dark grey), with tyres. The car was available only as an Avant and was sold only in European markets. Visual differences for the RS 6 Plus included the \\"black optic pack\\", which consisted of black finish to the framing of the radiator grille, exterior window trims, tailgate lower trim, roof rails, and exhaust tailpipes. It quickly sold out once it was released (999 units total). The last three digits of the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) are reproduced on a plaque inside the car, displayed on the centre console. ===C5 RS 6 in auto racing=== Champion Racing Audi RS6 Competition The RS 6 was used in the North American SPEED World Challenge GT Series of auto racing for three years - 2002 to 2004, claiming the manufacturers' championship victory successively in all three years.Audi.com Once again, the special race derivative of the twin-turbo V8 engine was developed and manufactured in the UK by Cosworth Technology (now known as MAHLE Powertrain). However, the 2005 season proved difficult due to performance restrictions imposed on Champion Audi Racing by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA), with Champion deciding to run a different wheel diameter, and the trade-off was reducing boost pressure. ==C6 (Typ 4F, 2008‚Äì2010)== Audi RS6 saloon (France) The ten (per side) LED daytime running lights (DRLs) - indicating a 10-cylinder engine Interior The second-generation RS 6, later called the Audi RS 6 5.0 TFSI quattro (Typ 4F) was based on the Volkswagen Group C6 automobile platform and was launched in September 2007 at the Frankfurt Motor Show. With factory production starting in December 2007, it was available in Europe from the same date, and began to be exported elsewhere in 2009. The total production run of the C6 RS 6 was 8,000 units, with 6,500 of these being Avants and the remainder saloons. The RS 6 was not available in North America, leaving the Audi S6 as the top performing trim there. (The unpopularity of wagons made it unlikely that the RS 6 Avant would be imported, and although it had been rumoured that the RS 6 sedan would be offered in the United States,Audi RS6 Sedan unveiled: details and photos - PaulTan.org blog. nothing came of this as the RS 6 importer could not clear US regulations). Production of the C6 RS 6 ended in the third quarter of 2010. The RS 6's V10 engine produced at 6,250 to 6,700 rpm and of torque from 1,500 to 6,250 rpm, and more than BMW's 5.0L V10. , the RS6 was Audi's single most powerful car ever,Audi UK - The New Audi RS6 - Pricing and Specification Guide, Edition 1. 02/08Audi UK - Audi RS6 - Pricing and Specification Guide, Edition 2. 05/08 and positioned the car ahead of its closest competitors, the BMW M5 and the Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG in terms of engine output, both of which have naturally aspirated engines. However the estimated price of the RS 6 sedan in 2010 was $160,000 USD (another source quotes $126,000 USD in 2009, making the RS 6 perhaps too expensive for the United States market) which set it apart from the performance variants of other executive cars: the MRSP of BMW M5's was $85,700 USD, of Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG's was $87,700 USD, and of Audi's own S6 was $78,025 USD. Official performance figures for the Avant: 4.6 seconds for the 0- sprint, 12.7 seconds 0-, and top speed is electronically limited to , with a factory option to de-restrict the top speed to . In standard form, CO2 emissions are rated at 333 g/km. The saloon reaches 0- in 4.5 seconds. ===C6 bodywork and styling=== Audi RS6 Avant quattro (C6) The C6 RS 6 Avant was launched in April 2008, and the four-door saloon/sedan was available from August 2008. Constructed from steel in a monocoque (unibody) design, the RS 6 uses lightweight aluminium for its front wings (fenders) and bonnet (hood). Visually, the RS 6 differed from the related S6, having flared front and rear wheel arches (fenders), harking back to the original Audi Quattro, to allow for a wider wheel track. It also had no front fog lights to allow for larger frontal air intakes (for the two side-mounted intercoolers (SMICs), and additional radiators). The ten (per side) front light-emitting diode (LED) daytime running lights (DRLs) are located within the main headlamp housing on the RS 6 in order to increase the size of the air intakes, whereas similar LEDs (but five per side) on the related S6 are found adjacent to the fog lamps in the lower front bumper. LED lighting technology was also used in the rear lights. The RS 6 also included adaptive headlights, which swivel around corners in conjunction with steering wheel movements. The facelifted Audi A6, released as a 2009 model, received similar front and rear-end LED lighting styling to that pioneered on the RS 6. Luggage capacity, measured according to the VDA 'block method' in the Avant ranges from , to . ===C6 powertrain=== The engine (parts code: 07L, identification code: BUH) of the RS6 was what Audi claimed to be the first all-aluminium alloy even firing 5.0-litre () 90¬∞ V10 twin-turbocharged (\\"biturbo\\"), Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), with a dry sump lubrication system. This engine is related to the naturally-aspirated V10 found in the Audi R8, S6 and S8, but the RS 6's engine has around 400 unique parts. The engine has four valves per cylinder, with chain-driven double overhead camshafts, and variable valve timingBosch Automotive Technology Variable valve timing direct gasoline injection for both inlet and exhaust camshafts. Charged intake air is cooled by two side-mounted intercoolers (SMIC)s. The engine is controlled by two Bosch DI-MotronicBosch Automotive Technology DI-Motronic for direct gasoline injection MED 9.1.2 engine control units, which act as 'master' and 'slave': two ECUs are required due to the high revs the engine can achieve. It also uses mapped direct ignition system with ten individual direct-acting spark coils, an electronic drive by wire throttle (Bosch \\"E-Gas\\"),Bosch Automotive Technology Electronic throttle control (ETC/EGAS) for direct gasoline injection cylinder-selective knock control, and cylinder bank adaptive lambda control, utilising eight lambda sensors. A total of seven radiators and four electric cooling fans are needed to cool the engine and related components under the aluminium bonnet of the RS6. Drive output passes through a ZF 6HP28A six-speed tiptronic automatic transmission. The gear ratios are: 1st: 4.171, 2nd: 2.340, 3rd: 1.521, 4th: 1.143, 5th: 0.867, 6th: 0.691, with shortened shift times, with \\"Dynamic Shift Programme\\" (DSP) and \\"Sport\\" mode. It has paddle-shifts mounted behind the flat-bottomed steering wheel, similar in design to the Audi B7 RS 4. The gearbox is set by default, in conventional automatic mode, to delay up-changes during acceleration, and change down earlier to maximise engine braking. Downshifts in all modes of operation include the Powertrain Control Module electronic control unit (ECU) \\"blipping\\" the Bosch \\"E-Gas\\" drive by wire throttle, for smoother shift shifts. The hydraulic torque converter includes a lock-up function in all forward gears and is able to completely disconnect when the vehicle is stationary, thus saving fuel. Like all Audi \\"RS\\" models, the RS 6 is fitted with Audi's 'trademark' Quattro permanent four-wheel drive as standard. This version of the RS 6 uses the latest asymmetric dynamic 40:60 front-to-rear default torque distribution from the Torsen T-3 'automatic torque biasing' (ATB) centre differential. This latest incarnation of the Torsen Quattro, first seen in the B7 RS 4, can automatically dynamically apportion up to a maximum 100% torque to the rear axle, or up to 80% to the front, dependent on traction conditions. The front and rear final drives are conventional \\"open\\" differentials (ratio 3.317) and use the Audi \\"Electronic Differential Lock\\" (EDL). EDL is a part, or \\"function\\", of the Bosch ESP 8.0 Electronic Stability Programme, which also includes \\"Anti-Slip Regulation\\" (ASR) traction control system. EDL does not 'lock' the differential in a traditional sense, but uses electronics to compare the speeds of the two wheels on an axle, and brakes any wheel that is sensed to have lost traction (by rotating faster than the opposite wheel, beyond normally accepted deviations). This braking of a slipping wheel has the effect of transferring torque across the axle to the other wheel, which is assumed still to have traction. ===C6 steering and suspension=== Like the previous RS6 and the B7 RS 4, this generation of RS 6 includes Audi's \\"Dynamic Ride Control\\" (DRC) Sports suspension system. The system is mainly mechanical, using a pump to provide additional pressure in the diagonally linked dampers (shock absorber) during cornering, to counteract rolling and pitching. The system can dynamically adjust the stiffness at each damper constantly to maintain both a comfortable ride and a high grip. In this version, it has a three-way level control, selectable from the Multi Media Interface controls. The steering system includes rack and pinion speed-dependent \\"servotronic\\" power steering, with a ratio of 12.5, and a turning circle of 12.2 metres. ===C6 brakes, wheels and tires=== The standard brakes on the RS 6 are cross-drilled, radially vented, and floating iron discs. At the front they are diameter and thick, clamped by gloss black six-piston fixed Brembo monoblock alloy calipers incorporating the \\"RS\\" logo, and at the rear they are diameter and with black single-piston floating calipers and an integrated electro-mechanical parking brake linkage. The parking brake serves doubles as a full emergency brake whilst the car is in motion, by applying maximum braking effort to all four wheels, resulting in activating the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS). Optional \\"Audi ceramic\\" Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide (C/SiC) composite front brakes are available, only with 20-inch wheels, which use diameter by thick drilled, vented, and floating SGL Carbon composite discs, with grey painted eight-piston fixed Alcon monobloc alloy calipers with the \\"Audi ceramic\\" logo. Irrespective of the type of disc construction, all brake discs are mounted via high strength steel mounting pins which connect the 'working' surface of the disc to lightweight alloy disc hubs. A specifically 'tuned' \\"sport-biased\\" Bosch ESP 8.0 Electronic Stability Programme is standard, and includes Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), and Brake Assist (BA). This ESP system has three user-selectable settings: \\"ESP-on\\" - the standard default full protection mode, \\"ESP-sportmode\\" (which turns off the ASR and EDL traction functions), and \\"ESP-off\\" (which fully disables all 'stability' and 'traction' related functions). Standard wheels (in the UK) are 9.5Jx20-inch '5-segment-spoke' design alloy wheels running on (eXtra Load) tyres (rated at per tyre), with official supplies being either Pirelli P-Zero Rosso or Dunlop SP SportMaxx GT. No-cost options are 9.5Jx20 '7-arm double spoke' design (identical style to B7 RS 4), or 9Jx19-inch '10-spoke' design alloys with Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 tyres. ===C6 other notable features=== *Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) digital radio tuner with DVD-based satellite navigation and Multi Media Interface (MMI), with optional hybrid digital/analogue TV tuner. * Solar sunroof operating the air-con whilst the vehicle is stationary and the engine is turned off * Rear window and rear side window manual sun blinds ==C7 (Typ 4G, 2013‚Äì2018)== Audi RS6 (United Kingdom) Audi revealed the details of the RS 6 Avant on December 5, 2012.Audi MediaServices Groundbreaking performance: The new Audi RS 6 Avant Its twin- turbo TFSI V8 engine develops at 5700-6600 rpm and of torque at 1750-5500 rpm. This will enable the RS 6 Avant to accelerate from 0 to in 3.9 seconds. The top speed is limited to by default. By adding the optional Dynamic or Dynamic Plus package, this top speed is increased to respectively or . Audi claims an average fuel consumption of and CO2 emissions of 223 g/km. In order to accomplish this, Audi has added a start-stop system and a cylinder on demand system. The RS 6 Avant is offered with an 8-speed tiptronic transmission. ===C7 RS6 Performance=== The RS6 Avant Performance is powered by the same 4.0-litre TFSI twin-turbo V8 engine as the standard RS6, http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/audi/rs6/93201/audi-rs6-avant-and- rs7-performance-editions-unveiled-with-597bhp but with the help of a retuned ECU mapping, it increased power output to at 6100-6800 rpm and increased torque to at 2500-5500 rpm. While the top speed remains limited to , or with Dynamic Plus package, the 0 to time has been reduced to just 3.7 seconds at from 0 to in 12.1 seconds. Despite the improved performance, the fuel economy and CO2 are unchanged from the standard RS6 Avant. ==C8 (Typ 5G, 2019‚ÄìPresent)== (rear) As with the previous generation, the new RS6 is powered by a 4.0-litre twin-turbo TFSI petrol engine, now boosted by a 48V belt alternator/starter mild-hybrid system, which can recover up to 16bhp. The engine also utilises a cylinder-on-demand system that can shut off half of its cylinders to boost fuel economy. The powertrain produces 600ps (591bhp) ‚Äì up from 560ps (552bhp) of the previous generation, but slightly below the 605ps (596bhp) offered by the 2016 Performance variant ‚Äì with 590lb ft (800 Nm) available between 2100rpm and 4500rpm. The acceleration to 100 km/h (62 mph) takes 3.6 seconds and 200 km/h in 12 seconds. As standard, top speed is limited to 250 km/h, with a further two levels courtesy of optional packs ‚Äì the Dynamic package allows 280 km/h, while the Dynamic package plus grants even more headroom for a maximum of 305 km/h. The C8 is first RS 6 Avant to have the hybrid drivetrain, utilising Riemen-Starter-Generator and 48-volt electrical system. The Quattro system has power distribution with 40% for front and 60% for rear. The system can adjust the power distribution up to 70% for front and to 85% for the rear if needed. The adaptive suspension system is 20 mm lower than standard A6 and can lower the vehicle further 10 mm during the high-speed driving or can raise the ride 20 mm at low speed. The Drive Select function gains configurable RS1 and RS2 modes, which are activated by an ‚ÄòRS mode‚Äô button positioned on the steering wheel. As well as adjusting the engine and handling responses, they also enable bespoke information on the Virtual Cockpit system. Under the new Euro-7 emissions law, Chairman of the Management Board of Audi, Herbert Diess recently said \\"The RS range set for 2022 will be the biggest change in the production line since 2004. The new RS range will be the most economical, low emission with the RS6 and Q8 will both have electric hybrid engines to reduce the current emission by 27%.\\" The new Electric range will begin production in the Audi Sport GmbH Neckarsulm factory in Germany. The new RS range is set to be in Australia in mid-2023 and is said to have a three-cylinder hybrid plug-in, also currently being taken on by Mercedes Benz in order to comply with the new Euro-7 emission law.https://therising.co/2019/04/05/audi-goes-green-with-new-electric-car- factory/ The new RS 6 Avant will also be sold in the US for the first time. The closest equivalent of RS 6 Avant in the past was the RS 7 Sportback. ==See also== *Audi Sport GmbH *Audi S and RS models *Audi A6 *Audi S6 *Audi S4 *Audi RS4 * List of vehicle speed records ==References== ==External links== *Audi UK RS models *The Torque Report - 2008 Audi RS6 Avant Press Release + photos *Audi RS6 international community Category:Cars introduced in 2002 Category:2010s cars RS6 Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Executive cars Category:Euro NCAP executive cars Category:Mid-size cars Category:Sports cars Category:Sports sedans Category:Station wagons ","title":"Audi RS 6"},{"id":"1436011","text":"The tzimtzum or tsimtsum (Hebrew ' \\"contraction/constriction/condensation\\") is a term used in the Lurianic Kabbalah to explain Isaac Luria's doctrine that God began the process of creation by \\"contracting\\" his Ohr Ein Sof (infinite light) in order to allow for a \\"conceptual space\\" in which finite and seemingly independent realms could exist. This primordial initial contraction, forming a ·∏•ƒÅlƒÅl happƒÅnuy \\"vacant space\\" () into which new creative light could beam, is denoted by general reference to the tzimtzum. In contrast to earlier, Medieval Kabbalah, this made the first creative act a concealment/Divine exile rather than unfolding revelation. This dynamic crisis-catharsis in the Divine flow is repeated throughout the Lurianic scheme. Because the tzimtzum results in the \\"empty space\\" in which spiritual and physical Worlds and ultimately, free will can exist, God is often referred to as \\"Ha-Makom\\" ( lit. \\"the Place\\", \\"the Omnipresent\\") in Rabbinic literature (\\"He is the Place of the World, but the World is not His Place\\"Parshat Vayeitzei: Yalkut Shimoni on the verse \\"He arrived...\\" Also, alternate sages in Midrash Bereishit Rabbah 68:9. HaMakom article, inner.org). In Kabbalistic interpretation, this describes the paradox of simultaneous Divine presence and absence within the vacuum and resultant Creation. Relatedly, Olam ‚Äî the Hebrew for \\"World/Realm\\" ‚Äî is derived from the root ◊¢◊ú◊ù meaning \\"concealment\\". This etymology is complementary with the concept of Tzimtzum in that the subsequent spiritual realms and the ultimate physical universe conceal to different degrees the infinite spiritual lifeforce of creation. Their progressive diminutions of the Divine Ohr (Light) from realm to realm in creation are also referred to in the plural as secondary tzimtzumim (innumerable \\"condensations/veilings/constrictions\\" of the lifeforce). However, these subsequent concealments are found in earlier, Medieval Kabbalah. The new doctrine of Luria advanced the notion of the primordial withdrawal (a dilug - radical \\"leap\\") in order to reconcile a causal creative chain from the Infinite with finite Existence. ==Lurianic thought== Isaac Luria introduced four central themes into kabbalistic thought, tzimtzum, Shevirat HaKelim (the shattering of the vessels), Tikkun (repair), and Partzufim. These four are a group of interrelated, and continuing, processes. Tzimtzum describes the first step in the process by which God began the process of creation by withdrawing his own essence from an area, creating an area in which creation could begin. Shevirat HaKelim describes how, after the tzimtzum, God created the vessels (HaKelim) in the empty space, and how when God began to pour his Light into the vessels they were not strong enough to hold the power of God's Light and shattered (Shevirat). The third step, Tikkun, is the process of gathering together, and raising, the sparks of God's Light that were carried down with the shards of the shattered vessels.James David Dunn, Windows of the Soul, p.21-24 Since tzimtzum is connected to the concept of exile, and Tikkun is connected to the need to repair the problems of the world of human existence, Luria unites the cosmology of Kabbalah with the practice of Jewish ethics, and makes ethics and traditional Jewish religious observance the means by which God allows humans to complete and perfect the material world through living the precepts of a traditional Jewish life.J.H. Laenen, Jewish Mysticism, p.168-169 ==Chabad view== In Chabad Hassidism the concept of tzimtzum is understood as not meant to be interpreted literally, but rather to refer to the manner in which God impresses his presence upon the consciousness of finite reality: thus tzimtzum is not only seen as being a real process but is also seen as a doctrine that every person is able, and indeed required, to understand and meditate upon. In the Chabad view, the function of the tzimtzum was \\"to conceal from created beings the activating force within them, enabling them to exist as tangible entities, instead of being utterly nullified within their source\\".Tanya, Shaar Hayichud veHaEmunah, ch.4 The tzimtzum produced the required \\"vacated space\\" (chalal panui , chalal ), devoid of direct awareness of God's presence. ==Vilna Gaon's view== The Vilna Gaon held that tzimtzum was not literal, however, the \\"upper unity\\", the fact that the universe is only illusory, and that tzimtzum was only figurative, was not perceptible, or even really understandable, to those not fully initiated in the mysteries of Kabbalah.E. J. Schochet, The Hasidic Movement and the Gaon of Vilna Others say that Vilna Gaon held the literal view of the tzimzum.Allan Nadler, The Faith of the Mithnagdim Shlomo Elyashiv articulates this view clearly (and claims that not only is it the opinion of the Vilna Gaon, but also is the straightforward and simple reading of Luria and is the only true understanding). He writes: However, the Gaon and Elyashiv held that tzimtzum only took place in God's will (Ratzon), but that it is impossible to say anything at all about God himself (Atzmus). Thus, they did not actually believe in a literal tzimtzum in God's essence. Luria's Etz Chaim itself, however, in the First Shaar, is ambivalent: in one place it speaks of a literal tzimtzum in God's essence and self, then it changes a few lines later to a tzimtzum in the Divine Light (an emanated, hence created and not part of God's self, energy). ==Inherent paradox== A commonly heldsee for example Aryeh Kaplan, \\"Paradoxes\\" (in \\"The Aryeh Kaplan Reader\\", Artscroll 1983. ) understanding in Kabbalah is that the concept of tzimtzum contains a built-in paradox, requiring that God be simultaneously transcendent and immanent. On the one hand, if the \\"Infinite\\" did not restrict itself, then nothing could exist‚Äîeverything would be overwhelmed by God's totality. Existence thus requires God's transcendence, as above. On the other hand, God continuously maintains the existence of, and is thus not absent from, the created universe. Rabbi Nachman of Breslav discusses this inherent paradox as follows: ==Application in clinical psychology== An Israeli professor, Mordechai Rotenberg, believes the Kabbalistic-Hasidic tzimtzum paradigm has significant implications for clinical therapy. According to this paradigm, God's \\"self- contraction\\" to vacate space for the world serves as a model for human behavior and interaction. The tzimtzum model promotes a unique community- centric approach which contrasts starkly with the language of Western psychology. ==In popular culture== Tsimtsum is central to the plot of Aryeh Lev Stollman's 1997 novel The Far Euphrates. \\"Tsim Tsum\\" is the title of a collection of vignettes by Sabrina Orah Mark (published 2009). In Yann Martel's novel Life of Pi and its 2012 film adaptation, a cargo ship called the Tsimtsum sinks at a pivotal point of the plot, despite the name being entirely irrelevant to the Judaic concept of tzimtzum. ==See also== * Acosmism * Apeiron (cosmology) * Big Bounce * Monism * Nondualism ==Notes== ==References== * Jacob Immanuel Schochet, Mystical Concepts in Chassidism, especially chapter II, Kehot 1979,3rd revised edition 1988. * Aryeh Kaplan, \\"Paradoxes\\", in \\"The Aryeh Kaplan Reader\\", Artscroll 1983. * Aryeh Kaplan, \\"Innerspace\\", Moznaim Pub.

He became Prime Minister of Egypt in 1919 during a difficult period in Egypt's political life. Many members of the Coptic Christian community to which he belonged, objected to his accepting the premiership on the grounds that it would antagonize the relationship between Muslims and Christians when both were united under the Wafd Party to fight against the British occupation.John D. McIntyre, (1985) \\"The Boycott of the Milner Mission: A Study in Egyptian Nationalism\\" Peter Lange Publisher, New York Youssef always maintained the view that it was critical that a government nominated by the Sultan of Egypt lead the country rather than have the British fully annex it (especially as the victorious powers were carving up the old Ottoman Empire at the Versailles conference).Sir William Hayter, op. cit., During his premiership, Youssef Wahba introduced several economic reforms including the removal of price controls on agricultural products, probably a first in the history of Egypt, as well as the creation of the Banque Misr by Talaat Harb Pasha, the first national bank. He joined the first independent Senate when he was elected from a district in Alexandria in 1924. During his tenure in the Egyptian Senate, he supported various legislation relating to strengthening the independence of the Egyptian judicial system. He also resisted the introduction of any special privileges for minorities in Egypt whether based on ethnicity or religion (including the Christian Copts) first suggested by the Brunyate Commission for Judicial reform in 1917. He retired from the Senate in 1930.Proceedings of the Egypt Senate (Majlis Al-Shuyukh) 1924, 1929-30, Government Press, Cairo (in Arabic) He has two publications on the Commercial Code in Egypt, the first co-authored with Shafik Mansour Bey \\"Sharh Al Qanun Al Madani\\" (An Analysis of the Egyptian Civil Code) and the second, co-authored with a fellow Judge from the Mixed Court Abdel Aziz Kahil Bey \\"Sharh Al Qanun Al Toujari Al Masri (An Analysis of The Egyptican Commercial Code).

It first appeared in Beano issue 1, dated 30 July 1938, drawn by Eric Roberts. A similarly named character had also appeared in the first issue of The Wizard under the name 'Elpful 'Enery. The central character is Henry, a young boy who attempts to be helpful but ends up doing more harm than good ‚Äì usually as a result of a misunderstanding or misinterpretation. He was also in The Dandy Annual 1939, which came out two months after Beano No. 1 ‚Äì it is unknown whether the character moved comic or if this was a preview. However some characters, such as Marmaduke Mean the Miser, only appeared in the annuals, so that could be the explanation. As well as this some early Dandy characters such as Podge appeared in the 1940 Beano annual so this could be the case of minor characters just appearing in any DC Thomson annual.

The music of Thrace contains a written history that extends back to the antiquity, when Orpheus became a legendary musician and lived close to Olympus.Orpheus and Greek Religion (Mythos Books) by William Keith Guthrie and L. Alderlink, 1993), , page 61, \\"... is a city Dion. Neadr it is a village called Pimpleia. It was there they say that Orpheus the Kikonian lived ... Though the Thracian people were eventually assimilated by surrounding Balkan groups, elements of Thracian folk music continue. Traditional Thracian dances are usually swift in tempo and are mostly circle dances in which the men dance at the front of the line. The gaida, a kind of bagpipe, is the most characteristic instrument, but clarinets and toumbelekis are also used. The Thracian gaida, also called the avlos, is different from the Macedonian or other Bulgarian bagpipes. It is more high in pitch then the Macedonian gaida but less so than the Bulgarian gaida (or Dura). The Thracian gaida is also still widely used throughout Thrace in northeastern Greece. ==Types of dances== *Chelebinsko (Chain Dance of the Gentlemen): is a choreography by Belco Stanev with great music in an interesting meter. It's 9/8 divided : 2 3 2 2. In the vocal part, the steps are exactly on the meter: QSQQ, but in the instrumental refrain, half a bar is added 2 3 (QS). The steps are in 2 2 2 3 (QQQS) and the missing half bar 2 2 (QQ) is added at the end so that is missing (mathematically). *Izgryala E Mesechinka (The moon has risen): A beautiful song from Northern (Bulgarian) Thrace that has inspired many choreographies, all of them with extensive arm work that is typical in dances from this region. *Jambolsko Paidushko: Pajdusko/Paidushko horo/Baiduska, etc. is a family of dances usually danced to 5/16 or 5/8 (Q S) rhythm and found in a large area spanning Serbia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Greece, and beyond. It is the classic \\"aksak\\" (Turkish for limping) dance and rhythm. Its various forms reflect local preferences. This one is from the Jambol region in Northern (Bulgarian) Thrace, and was first introduced in the States by Dick Crum. *Krivo Sadovsko Horo (Twisted chain dance from Sadovo, Northern Thrace): Very fast dance, with special rhythm (13/8), this dance has many versions. *Pazardzhishka Kopanitsa: Pazardzhik Kopanitsa from Pazardzhik, Northern Thrace. *Pravo Trakiisko Horo: Pravo Trakiisko Horo (Straight Thracian chain dance) is from Northern Thrace. It has very little in common with the simple Pravo horo (straight chain dance). It's a challenging choreography by a performing group that was brought down from the stage. *Sedi Donka (Donka is sitting): One of the most unusual musical patterns in Bulgaria, Sedi Donka is in 25/16 meters. It is subdivided 7+7+11, which in turn can be subdivided 3 2 2, 3 2 2, 2 2 3 2 2. *Trakiiska Rachenitsa: Trakiiska Rachenitsa is a highly stylized rachenitsa from Northern Thrace with much arm work. *Trite Pati: Trite Pati (the three times) is a dance from Northern Thrace. Like some other Thracian dances, it is also danced in Western (Greek) Thrace. *Kuluriastos: Kuluriastos is a Greek dance from Western Thrace. It has a slower Zonaradikos part, and a faster part where the beginning of the line loops into the center and back out again. It's a lot of fun to dance this, especially if the dancer is near the beginning of the line. As with many Greek dances, it can be danced to many songs. This one is Pses idia st'oniro mu. *Sfarlis: Sfarlis is a beginner's dance from Western Thrace. *Troiro: Many Bulgarian dances from Northern Thrace have \\"cousins\\" (very similar dances) in Western (Greek) Thrace, and this is one of them: a Greek dance that sounds and feels Bulgarian. *Dostlar Bizim Halaya: This is a rom dance from Eastern (Turkish) Thrace. It is a reminder of the so-called \\"tsigansko horo\\" (gypsy chain dance), but the dances are not at all alike. *Hassapia: an ancient dance that simulates a stealth approach on any enemy camp, from beginning to victory. The hassapia dance has been dated back to Hellenistic times, before the time of Alexander the Great whose soldiers brought it to Macedonia. It is a warrior's dance in which the movements represent the noiseless approach on the enemy camp, the encounter, the fight, and the victory. This dance is done in a circle using a shoulder hold. A similar dance called \\"kasapsko horo\\" (butcher's chain dance) is performed in Bulgaria. *Kallinitikos: performed by three people (either two men and one woman or two women and one man), named after the kalines, or friends of the bride during her wedding, who escort her to the church performing this dance. Kallinitikos is a dance done by groups of three people: a man in the middle and two women at his sides or a woman in the middle and two men at her sides. The dance is named after the kalines, the bride's girlfriends, who do this dance as they escort her to the church. Performed in Western Thrace. *Kouseftos: derived from kousevo (to run in the Ancient Thracian language), performed, not in a circle, but in the form of a labyrinthKouseftos, with its characteristic quick running steps, takes its name from the word kousevo in Ancient Thrace which means 'to run. It differs from other Thracian dances in that, instead of being danced in a circle, its dance progression takes the form of a labyrinth. Performed in Western Thrace. *Mandilatos (Mandra): a couples dance performed at weddings. Mandilatos is a couples' dance which takes its name from the mandilia or handkerchiefs that the dancers hold while dancing. This dance is done at weddings as the guests escort the bride or the best man to the church. During the procession, some guests hold a mirror which symbolizes the purity of the bride and others hold brooms which symbolize her housekeeping ability. This dance is performed in Western Thrace. A similar dance called \\"rachenitsa\\" (from \\"raka\\" - an arm) is performed in Northern Thrace. *Stis tris: a slow but swift dance. Stis Tris means \\"in threes.\\" Each dance set is composed of three parts of four steps each. The arms are held down and move in a synchronized motion with the steps. This dance is performed under different names in Northern Thrace and Western Thrace. *Syngathistos: performed as the bride and groom are escorted to and from the church during weddings. Syngathistos is a free style couples dance that is danced as the bride and groom are escorted to and from the church. The bridal party also dances as they display and exchange gifts with the bride and groom, particularly gifts of handkerchiefs and head scarves. This dance is performed in Western Thrace. *Xesyrtos: a circle dance with men performed at the front of the line. Xesyrtos is a circle dance in which the men dance at the front of the line, followed by the women, and do variations to the dance step with characteristic slaps, jumps, and kicks. This dance is performed in Western Thrace. *Zonaradikos: a circle dance in which the participants hold each other's belts. This is the primary dance of Western Thrace and primarily danced by men where many tricks are performed. The Zonaradikos is a circle dance in which the dancers hold each other by their belts or zonaria (hence the name Zonaradikos). This dance is done in every village and region of Thrace. Three variations of the basic step are paties or stomps, monopatia or single stomp, and psalidia or scissors, usually followed by the koulouriastos or curling. A similar dance called \\"na poyas\\" (for belt) is found in Northern Thrace. *Dousko Zonaradiko-Tsestos: Tsestos is a challenging dance from Northern Greece (the region named Thrace or in Greek language Thraki). The dance starts with a moderate rhythm and is danced by both men and women with very few figure (this is an intro dance named Dousko, the steps are the same as the dance Zonaradiko (twelve steps) . As it goes on men come in front and they catch each other by the zonari (belt). At this point the dance becomes very quick and it consists of figures only(on twelve steps too). It performed by the Greek population of Northern Thrace (Anatoliki Romylia) and continues to be performed by all Greeks. It has roots in the most ancient dance of the world, the Greek dance Pyrihios which also has twelve steps. Bulgarian Trakiisko Pravo Horo has a lot in common with dousko zonaradiko Tsestos because in the past Greek population live on this field of Northern Thrace at Byzantine ages and now Bulgarians and many Greeks live in this area. *Paidushko (Baiduska, Pajdusko, Pajduska, Payduska): a very aggressive dance, usually performed by men. It is performed using heavy movement. Performed in all three regions of Thrace: Northern (Paidushko Horo), Western (Baiduska), and Eastern (Payduska). *Halay: Halay is a famous dance in the Middle East. It is a symbol for the tempestuous way of life in its place of origin, Anatolia. It is a national dance in Armenia and Turkey. The traditional form of the Halay dance is played on the Zurna, supported by a Davul. The dancers form a circle or line while holding each other with the little finger.

At its publication, Narcissus and Goldmund was considered Hesse's literary triumph; chronologically, it follows Steppenwolf. ==Synopsis== Narcissus and Goldmund is the story of a young man, Goldmund (), who wanders aimlessly throughout Medieval Germany after leaving a Catholic monastery school in search of what could be described as \\"the meaning of life\\". Narcissus (German: \\"Narziss or, before the German spelling reform of 1996, Narzi√ü ), a gifted young teacher at the cloister school, quickly befriends Goldmund, as they are only a few years apart, and Goldmund is naturally bright. Goldmund looks up to Narcissus, and Narcissus has much fondness for him in return. After straying too far in the fields one day on an errand gathering herbs, Goldmund comes across a beautiful Gypsy woman, who kisses him and invites him to make love. This encounter becomes his epiphany; he now knows he was never meant to be a monk. With Narcissus' help, he leaves the monastery and embarks on a wandering existence. Goldmund finds he is very attractive to women, and has numerous love affairs. After seeing a particularly beautiful carved Madonna in a church, he feels his own artistic talent awakening and seeks out the master carver, with whom he studies for several years. However, in the end Goldmund refuses an offer of guild membership, preferring the freedom of the road. When the Black Death devastates the region, Goldmund encounters human existence at its ugliest. Finally, after being imprisoned and set to be executed, he is reunited with and saved by his friend Narcissus, now an abbot, and the two reflect upon the different paths their lives have taken, contrasting the artist with the thinker. The timeline and geography of the narrative is left somewhat vague, as the tale is rather abstract, and there is little attempt at historical accuracy. For example, some of Narcissus and Goldmund's discussions of philosophy and science sound too modern to have taken place during medieval times. ==Themes== In this novel the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche's theory of the Apollonian versus Dionysian spirit is evident. The polarization of Narcissus's individualist Apollonian character stands in contrast to the passionate and zealous disposition of Goldmund. Hesse, in the spirit of Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy, completes the equation by creating Goldmund as a wanderer (a Dionysian endeavour) balanced out by Narcissus, the structured and stable priest-monk (an Apollonian approach), and highlighting the harmonizing relationship between the main characters. Goldmund is presented as an evolving seeker who attempts to embody both Apollonian and Dionysian elements, thus capturing Nietzsche's conception of the ideal tragedy. Goldmund comes to embody a wide spectrum of the human experience, lusting for the gruesome ecstasy of the sensual world yet capturing and representing it through his talent as a sculptor. Like most of Hesse's works, the main theme of this book is the wanderer's struggle to find himself, as well as the Jungian union of polar opposites (Mysterium Coniunctionis). Goldmund represents nature and the \\"feminine mind\\", while Narcissus represents science and logic and God and the \\"masculine mind\\". These \\"feminine\\" and \\"masculine\\" qualities are drawn from the Jungian archetypal structure, and is reminiscent of some of his earlier works, especially Demian. Throughout the novel, Goldmund increasingly becomes aware of memories of his own mother, which ultimately results in his desire to return to the Urmutter (primordial mother). However, he also tries to reconcile the Apollonian and Dionysian ideals through art (giving form to the formless). ==English translations== The first translation into English, (by Geoffrey Dunlop), appeared in 1932 titled Death and the Lover. Penguin Modern Classics published this translation in 1971, entitled \\"Narziss and Goldmund\\", reprinting in 1971, 1972x2, 1973x2, 1974x2, 1976, 1978.

She has also campaigned for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. ==Background== Longfield was born in Timmins, Ontario. She graduated from North Bay Teacher's College, and worked as a community college teacher before taking time off to raise a family. She was a governor of the Trafalgar Castle School for Girls. Longfield began working for the Liberal Party in 1965 as an organizer, and was an executive assistant to Ontario Liberal Members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs) Allan Furlong and Steve Mahoney. She was a field organizer in Jean Chr√©tien's 1990 leadership campaign, and co-managed Dalton McGuinty's bid to become provincial leader in 1996. ==Politics== Longfield was elected to the Whitby municipal council in 1991, winning a close victory in the city's second ward. She was re-elected in 1994. Longfield was involved with the local government division of the National Democratic Institute in this period, and represented Canada on delegations to Romania and Guyana. Longfield was designated as the Liberal candidate for Whitby‚ÄîAjax in the 1997 federal election, as part of an effort by Prime Minister Chr√©tien to increase the number of female Members of Parliament (MPs) in the Liberal caucus. She won a convincing victory, and was returned in the 2000 and 2004 elections, fending off a strong challenge from the Conservative Party on the latter occasion.

In the simplest case, consider a function of two variables such that :\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2u}{\\\\partial x^2}+\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2u}{\\\\partial y^2}=0. The weak maximum principle, in this setting, says that for any open precompact subset of the domain of , the maximum of on the closure of is achieved on the boundary of . The strong maximum principle says that, unless is a constant function, the maximum cannot also be achieved anywhere on itself. Such statements give a striking qualitative picture of solutions of the given differential equation. Such a qualitative picture can be extended to many kinds of differential equations. In many situations, one can also use such maximum principles to draw precise quantitative conclusions about solutions of differential equations, such as control over the size of their gradient. There is no single or most general maximum principle which applies to all situations at once. In the field of convex optimization, there is an analogous statement which asserts that the maximum of a convex function on a compact convex set is attained on the boundary.Chapter 32 of Rockafellar (1970). ==Intuition== ===A partial formulation of the strong maximum principle=== Here we consider the simplest case, although the same thinking can be extended to more general scenarios. Let be an open subset of Euclidean space and let be a function on such that :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2u}{\\\\partial x^i\\\\partial x^j}=0 where for each and between 1 and , is a function on with . Fix some choice of in . According to the spectral theorem of linear algebra, all eigenvalues of the matrix are real, and there is an orthonormal basis of consisting of eigenvectors. Denote the eigenvalues by and the corresponding eigenvectors by , for from 1 to . Then the differential equation, at the point , can be rephrased as :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\lambda_i\\\\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\\\\Big_{t=0}\\\\big(u(x+tv_i)\\\\big)=0. The essence of the maximum principle is the simple observation that if each eigenvalue is positive (which amounts to a certain formulation of \\"ellipticity\\" of the differential equation) then the above equation imposes a certain balancing of the directional second derivatives of the solution. In particular, if one of the directional second derivatives is negative, then another must be positive. At a hypothetical point where is maximized, all directional second derivatives are automatically nonpositive, and the \\"balancing\\" represented by the above equation then requires all directional second derivatives to be identically zero. This elementary reasoning could be argued to represent an infinitesimal formulation of the strong maximum principle, which states, under some extra assumptions (such as the continuity of ), that must be constant if there is a point of where is maximized. Note that the above reasoning is unaffected if one considers the more general partial differential equation :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2u}{\\\\partial x^i\\\\partial x^j}+\\\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x^i}=0, since the added term is automatically zero at any hypothetical maximum point. The reasoning is also unaffected if one considers the more general condition :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2u}{\\\\partial x^i\\\\partial x^j}+\\\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x^i}\\\\geq 0, in which one can even note the extra phenomena of having an outright contradiction if there is a strict inequality ( rather than ) in this condition at the hypothetical maximum point. This phenomena is important in the formal proof of the classical weak maximum principle. ===Non-applicability of the strong maximum principle=== However, the above reasoning no longer applies if one considers the condition :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2u}{\\\\partial x^i\\\\partial x^j}+\\\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x^i}\\\\leq 0, since now the \\"balancing\\" condition, as evaluated at a hypothetical maximum point of , only says that a weighted average of manifestly nonpositive quantities is nonpositive. This is trivially true, and so one cannot draw any nontrivial conclusion from it. This is reflected by any number of concrete examples, such as the fact that :\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\big(-x^2-y^2\\\\big)+\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial y^2}\\\\big(-x^2-y^2\\\\big)\\\\leq 0, and on any open region containing the origin, the function certainly has a maximum. == The classical weak maximum principle for linear elliptic PDE == === The essential idea === Let denote an open subset of Euclidean space. If a smooth function u:M\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} is maximized at a point , then one automatically has: * (du)(p)=0 * ( abla^2 u)(p)\\\\leq 0, as a matrix inequality. One can view a partial differential equation as the imposition of an algebraic relation between the various derivatives of a function. So, if is the solution of a partial differential equation, then it is possible that the above conditions on the first and second derivatives of form a contradiction to this algebraic relation. This is the essence of the maximum principle. Clearly, the applicability of this idea depends strongly on the particular partial differential equation in question. For instance, if solves the differential equation :\\\\Delta u=du^2+2, then it is clearly impossible to have \\\\Delta u\\\\leq 0 and du=0 at any point of the domain. So, following the above observation, it is impossible for to take on a maximum value. If, instead solved the differential equation \\\\Delta u=du^2 then one would not have such a contradiction, and the analysis given so far does not imply anything interesting. If solved the differential equation \\\\Delta u=du^2-2, then the same analysis would show that cannot take on a minimum value. The possibility of such analysis is not even limited to partial differential equations. For instance, if u:M\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} is a function such that :\\\\Delta u-du^4=\\\\int_M e^{u(x)}\\\\,dx, which is a sort of \\"non-local\\" differential equation, then the automatic strict positivity of the right-hand side shows, by the same analysis as above, that cannot attain a maximum value. There are many methods to extend the applicability of this kind of analysis in various ways. For instance, if is a harmonic function, then the above sort of contradiction does not directly occur, since the existence of a point where \\\\Delta u(p)\\\\leq 0 is not in contradiction to the requirement \\\\Delta u=0 everywhere. However, one could consider, for an arbitrary real number , the function defined by :u_s(x)=u(x)+se^{x_1}. It is straightforward to see that :\\\\Delta u_s=se^{x_1}. By the above analysis, if s>0 then cannot attain a maximum value. One might wish to consider the limit as to 0 in order to conclude that also cannot attain a maximum value. However, it is possible for the pointwise limit of a sequence of functions without maxima to have a maxima. Nonetheless, if has a boundary such that together with its boundary is compact, then supposing that can be continuously extended to the boundary, it follows immediately that both and attain a maximum value on M\\\\cup\\\\partial M. Since we have shown that , as a function on , does not have a maximum, it follows that the maximum point of , for any , is on \\\\partial M. By the sequential compactness of \\\\partial M, it follows that the maximum of is attained on \\\\partial M. This is the weak maximum principle for harmonic functions. This does not, by itself, rule out the possibility that the maximum of is also attained somewhere on . That is the content of the \\"strong maximum principle,\\" which requires further analysis. The use of the specific function e^{x_1} above was very inessential. All that mattered was to have a function which extends continuously to the boundary and whose Laplacian is strictly positive. So we could have used, for instance, :u_s(x)=u(x)+sx^2 with the same effect. ==The classical strong maximum principle for linear elliptic PDE== ===Summary of proof=== Let be an open subset of Euclidean space. Let u:M\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} be a twice-differentiable function which attains its maximum value . Suppose that :a_{ij}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2u}{\\\\partial x^i\\\\partial x^j}+b_i\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x^i}\\\\geq 0. Suppose that one can find (or prove the existence of): * a compact subset of , with nonempty interior, such that for all in the interior of , and such that there exists on the boundary of with . * a continuous function h:\\\\Omega\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} which is twice- differentiable on the interior of and with ::a_{ij}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2h}{\\\\partial x^i\\\\partial x^j}+b_i\\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial x^i}\\\\geq 0, : and such that one has on the boundary of with Then on with on the boundary of ; according to the weak maximum principle, one has on . This can be reorganized to say :-\\\\frac{u(x)-u(x_0)}{x-x_0}\\\\geq \\\\frac{h(x)-h(x_0)}{x-x_0} for all in . If one can make the choice of so that the right-hand side has a manifestly positive nature, then this will provide a contradiction to the fact that is a maximum point of on , so that its gradient must vanish. ===Proof=== The above \\"program\\" can be carried out. Choose to be a spherical annulus; one selects its center to be a point closer to the closed set than to the closed set , and the outer radius is selected to be the distance from this center to ; let be a point on this latter set which realizes the distance. The inner radius is arbitrary. Define :h(x)=\\\\varepsilon\\\\Big(e^{-\\\\alphax-x_{\\\\text{c}}^2}-e^{-\\\\alpha R^2}\\\\Big). Now the boundary of consists of two spheres; on the outer sphere, one has ; due to the selection of , one has on this sphere, and so holds on this part of the boundary, together with the requirement . On the inner sphere, one has . Due to the continuity of and the compactness of the inner sphere, one can select such that . Since is constant on this inner sphere, one can select such that on the inner sphere, and hence on the entire boundary of .

There are various conditions under which the right-hand side can be guaranteed to be nonnegative; see the statement of the theorem below. Lastly, note that the directional derivative of at along the inward-pointing radial line of the annulus is strictly positive. As described in the above summary, this will ensure that a directional derivative of at is nonzero, in contradiction to being a maximum point of on the open set . ===Statement of the theorem=== The following is the statement of the theorem in the books of Morrey and Smoller, following the original statement of Hopf (1927): The point of the continuity assumption is that continuous functions are bounded on compact sets, the relevant compact set here being the spherical annulus appearing in the proof. Furthermore, by the same principle, there is a number such that for all in the annulus, the matrix has all eigenvalues greater than or equal to . One then takes , as appearing in the proof, to be large relative to these bounds. Evans's book has a slightly weaker formulation, in which there is assumed to be a positive number which is a lower bound of the eigenvalues of for all in . These continuity assumptions are clearly not the most general possible in order for the proof to work. For instance, the following is Gilbarg and Trudinger's statement of the theorem, following the same proof: {\\\\lambda} and \\\\textstyle\\\\frac{b_i}{\\\\lambda} are bounded functions on for each between 1 and . If is a nonconstant function on such that :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{j=1}^na_{ij}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2u}{\\\\partial x^i\\\\partial x^j}+\\\\sum_{i=1}^nb_i\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x^i}\\\\geq 0 on , then does not attain a maximum value on .}} One cannot naively extend these statements to the general second-order linear elliptic equation, as already seen in the one- dimensional case. For instance, the ordinary differential equation has sinusoidal solutions, which certainly have interior maxima. This extends to the higher-dimensional case, where one often has solutions to \\"eigenfunction\\" equations which have interior maxima. The sign of c is relevant, as also seen in the one-dimensional case; for instance the solutions to are exponentials, and the character of the maxima of such functions is quite different from that of sinusoidal functions. == See also == * Maximum modulus principle * Hopf maximum principle ==Notes== ==References== ===Research articles=== * Calabi, E.

Becker. He originally created the software as the result of a poker game with friends that were praising the BBS software created by Ward Christensen. Mr. Becker said he could do better and founded eSoft, Inc. in 1984 based on the strength of TBBS sales. ==History== TBBS is an abbreviation for The Bread Board System, although this explanation was buried in the documentation. This was different because \\"BBS\\" was most commonly used to stand for Bulletin Board System. The name was chosen because it drew parallels between an electronics \\"breadboard\\" (where the basis for any circuit can be built). TBBS started out in 1983 as a single line Bulletin Board System (BBS) originally written for RadioShack TRS-80 machines, and was later ported to IBM-PC computers. Its advantage was that it could be fully customized by the system operator, so that no two TBBS systems looked the same. Other BBS packages at the time had their menu structures hard coded. As time progressed, Phil completely re-wrote the TBBS program in assembler to operate on IBM PCs running under DOS. In 1988, he added a custom multitasking kernel that allowed multiple callers to access the TBBS system at the same time. Other BBS software packages could only achieve simultaneous user access by either running their software on LAN systems, dedicating one complete machine per modem, or under multitasking software such as Quarterdeck's DESQview. TBBS achieved multiple lines all on the one machine. For those wishing to run two lines, no additional hardware was needed - you only needed to use COM1 and COM2. For those wishing to run more lines, multiport serial boards from a company called Digiboard were used to allow up to 96 modems to be hooked into the one machine. At its height in 1996, TBBS could support more simultaneous users at full speed on less hardware than any competing BBS product. Many software companies, like Microsoft, and most computer hardware companies all around the world relied on TBBS for their online technical support and file download services until Internet web and FTP sites replaced the need for a direct dial BBS presence in the mid 1990s. ==Option Modules== Add-On \\"Option Modules\\" were used to internally extend the TBBS feature set. * TDBS (The Data Base System) was a dBase3 compatible compiled language that supported creation of multiline applications and games without having to exit the TBBS environment via batchfiles (or dropfiles) making it more stable than its competitors. * TIMS was released to allow interaction with FidoNet technology. * QSO was released to allow users to use the popular QWK message format for offline mail reading. * SYSOM was released to give the sysop real time control over files and user accounts and menu flags without bringing the TBBS system down. * Interchange was released to allow the TBBS system to grab outgoing modem lines to dial other services, networking multiple BBS systems together. * TIGER was released to allow users access to Internet email and newsgroups. All in all, TBBS and its option modules were far beyond the performance and reliability of what other BBS authors could dream of. TBBS had power not even anticipated by the author. For example, in 1988 the University of Southern California installed TBBS for their 16 line BBS system administered by Susan Biddlecomb, who was Director of Computer Support of the USC Health Care system. The actual computer was housed in the Computer Facility, some distance from her office, necessitating her to go to the computer facility to make the most minor change. Her solution was to completely dispense with the internal menu and interface system, devising a standard menu layout, and building menus ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù using the add-on TDBS module. She would upload any changes or additions to the menus as entries in the database, and remotely recompile the menus. After a daily reboot, the changes would automatically take effect without the necessity for a trip to the computer room. A side benefit was dynamic content -- upon registration or login, the user could enter or change any information, such as personal information, preferences, or sub-boards of interest, this information was entered into the database, and this would then dynamically customize the menu system presented to the user, and no two users were necessarily presented with the same information. This meant that the entire interface seen by the users was in actuality an add-on running under TDBS with the main program functioning merely as a multi-tasker. A similar concept is widely used today on the World Wide Web as database driven content, one of its most powerful features. E-Soft did not publicize this method of constructing the menu system and left it up to the users to discover the power this advanced implementation. ==IPAD== In 1993, Phil Becker saw the approaching commercial migration to the Internet and started work on the IPAD (Internet Protocol Adapter) project. It was designed as an embedded hardware+software solution that originally focused on bidirectional telnet access to TBBS. It also provided other services (RAS, DNS, FTP, etc.) for those TBBS callers on dial in lines using the IPAD machine as a direct gateway. This allowed many IPAD owners to more easily become Internet Service Providers (ISP's) as BBS usage on the whole began to wane, caused by the growing popularity of the Internet. The IPAD was extremely popular with commercial TBBS operators. Unfortunately, it was very expensive and beyond the reach of most hobby TBBS sysops that had already invested thousands of dollars into TBBS plus option modules for use on free systems with no hope of ever making a profit. ==Aftermath== eSoft and TBBS went their separate ways as eSoft pursued the Internet market. All new TBBS development ended in 1997 and by the end of 1999 all technical support for TBBS and associated products officially ended. New TBBS sales continued through 2003 as part of vertical applications built with the TDBS language. TBBS was until recently supported by a user support forum at TBBS.org. IPAD is currently developed and supported by the IPAD Owners Association, Inc. eSoft is located in Broomfield, Colorado. ==References== ===Sources=== * == External links == * IPAD Owners Association, Inc. * ONE BBSCON 1994: TBBS UltraChat, presented by Bob Hartman * ONE BBSCON 1994: TBBS: Future Directions presented by Phil Becker, Bob Hartman Category:Bulletin board system software Category:DOS software ","title":"The Bread Board System"},{"id":"1436135","text":"Western Trunk line () is a railway line of the Taiwan Railways Administration in western Taiwan. It is by far the busiest line, having served over 171 million passengers in 2016. The total length of the line is 404.5 km. The line is an official classification of physical tracks and does not correspond to particular services. It is connected to Taichung line (mountain line; ) at Zhunan and Changhua. Many services turn inland to take the Taichung route, then reconnect back to the main line (West Coast line). Train schedules and departure boards mark either mountain or coastal () line to indicate the route taken. ==History== The original railroad between Keelung and Twatutia was completed in 1891. The section between Twatutia and Hsinchu was finished in 1893. However, in the Japanese era, these sections were all rebuilt by the Government-General of Taiwan as part of its Taiwan Trunk Railway (, J≈´kan Tetsud≈ç) project. The Taiwan Trunk Railway was completed in 1908 with route from Kƒ´run (, Keelung) through Taihoku (, Taipei), Shinchiku (, Hsinchu), Taich≈´ (, Taichung), Tainan (, Tainan), to Takao (, Kaohsiung). The Taiwan Trunk Railway at that time went through all major cities in western Taiwan. However, the terrain around Taich≈´ (Taichung) created a significant bottleneck for rail freight transport. To resolve this issue, the Government-General of Taiwan decided to built a Coastal Line (, Kaigan-sen) between Chikunan (, Zhunan) and Sh≈çka (, Changhua) to relieve the congestion. The construction of the Coastal Line was started in 1919 and completed in 1922. The Coastal Line then became a part of the main West Coast Line, and the original railway through Taich≈´ (Taichung) was named as a separate line (Taichung line).

It was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777. A moderate-sized deer, male chital reach nearly and females at the shoulder. While males weigh , the lighter females weigh . It is sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and antlers are present only on males. The upper parts are golden to rufous, completely covered in white spots. The abdomen, rump, throat, insides of legs, ears, and tail are all white. The antlers, three-pronged, are nearly long. ==Etymology== The vernacular name \\"chital\\" (pronounced ) comes from cƒ´tal (), derived from the Sanskrit word ' (‡§ö‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§≤‡§É) meaning variegated or spotted. The name of the cheetah has a similar origin. Variations of \\"chital\\" include \\"cheetal\\" and \\"cheetul\\". Other common names for the chital are Indian spotted deer (or simply the spotted deer), and axis deer. ==Taxonomy and phylogeny== The chital was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777 as Cervus axis. In 1827, English naturalist Charles Hamilton Smith placed the chital in its own subgenus Axis under the genus Cervus. Later Axis was elevated to generic status by taxonomists such as Colin P. Groves and Peter Grubb. In the past Hyelaphus ‚Äì comprising the Bawean deer (H. kuhli), the Calamian deer (H. calamianensis ), and the hog deer (H. porcinus) ‚Äì was considered a subgenus of Axis. However a morphological analysis in 2004 showed significant differences between Axis and Hyelaphus. A phylogenetic study later that year showed that Hyelaphus is closer to the genus Rusa than Axis. Axis was revealed to be paraphyletic and distant from Hyelaphus in the phylogenetic tree; the chital was found to form a clade with Rucervus duvaucelii (barasinga) and R. schomburgki (Schomburgk's deer). The chital was estimated to have diverged from the Rucervus lineage in the Early Pliocene (five million years ago). The following cladogram is based on the 2004 phylogenetic study: Fossils of extinct Axis species dating back to the Early to Middle Pliocene are known from central to southern Asia from Iran in the east to Indochina in the west. ==Description== Male in velvet, Kanha National Park The chital is a moderately sized deer. Males reach nearly and females at the shoulder; the head-and-body length is around . While immature males weigh , the lighter females weigh . Mature males can weigh up to . The tail, long, is marked by a dark stripe that stretches along its length. The species is sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and antlers are present only on males. The dorsal (upper) parts are golden to rufous, completely covered in white spots. The abdomen, rump, throat, insides of legs, ears, and tail are all white. A conspicuous black stripe runs along the spine (back bone). The chital has well-developed preorbital glands (near the eyes) which have stiff hairs. It also has well-developed metatarsal glands and pedal glands located in its hind legs. The preorbital glands, larger in males than in females, are frequently opened in response to certain stimuli. Each of the antlers has three lines on it. The brow tine (the first division in the antler) is roughly perpendicular to the beam (the central stalk of the antler). The antlers, three-pronged, are nearly long. Antlers, as in most other cervids, are shed annually. The antlers emerge as soft tissues (known as velvet antlers) and progressively harden into bony structures (known as hard antlers), following mineralisation and blockage of blood vessels in the tissue, from the tip to the base. A study of the mineral composition of the antlers of captive barasinga, chital, and hog deer showed that the antlers of the deer are very similar. The mineral content of the chital's antlers was determined to be (per kg): copper, cobalt, and zinc. Hooves measure between in length; hooves of the fore legs are longer than those of the hind legs. The toes taper to a point. The dental formula is , same as the elk. The milk canine, nearly long, falls off before one year of age, but is not replaced by a permanent tooth as in other cervids. Compared to the hog deer, the chital has a more cursorial build. The antlers and brow tines are longer than those in the hog deer. The pedicles (the bony cores from which antlers arise) are shorter and the auditory bullae are smaller in the chital. The chital may be confused with the fallow deer. Chital have several white spots, whereas fallow deer usually have white splotches. Fallow also have palmate antlers whereas chital have 3 dinstinct points on each side. The chital has a prominent white patch on its throat, while the throat of the fallow deer is completely white. The biggest distinction is the dark brown stripe running down the chital's back. The hairs are smooth and flexible. ==Ecology and behaviour== Male feeding in Nagarhole Female running in Mudumalai Chital are active throughout the day. In the summer, time is spent in rest under shade, and the sun's glare is avoided if the temperature reaches ; activity peaks as dusk approaches. As days grow cooler, foraging begins before sunrise and peaks by early morning. Activity slows down during midday, when the animals rest or loiter about slowly. Foraging recommences by late afternoon and continues till midnight. They fall asleep a few hours before sunrise, typically in the forest which is cooler than the glades. These deer typically move in a single file on specific tracks, with a distance of two to three times their width between them, when on a journey, typically in search of food and water sources. A study in the Gir National Park (Gujarat, India) showed that chital travel the most in summer of all seasons. When cautiously inspecting its vicinity, the chital stands motionless and listens with rapt attention, facing the potential danger, if any. This stance may be adopted by nearby individuals, as well. As an antipredator measure, chital flee in groups (unlike the hog deer that disperse on alarm); sprints are often followed by hiding in dense undergrowth. The running chital has its tail raised, exposing the white underparts. The chital can leap and clear fences as high as , but prefers to dive under them. It stays within of cover. A gregarious animal, the chital forms matriarchal herds comprising an adult female and her offspring of the previous and the present year, which may be associated with individuals of any age and either sex, male herds, and herds of juveniles and mothers. Small herds are common, though aggregations of as many as 100 individuals have been observed. Groups are loose and disband frequently, save for the juvenile-mother herd. Herd membership in Texas is typically up to 15; herds can have five to 40 members in India. Studies in the Nallamala Hills (Andhra Pradesh, India) and the Western Ghats (western coast of India) showed seasonal variation in the sex ratio of herds; this was attributed to the tendency of females to isolate themselves ahead of parturition. Similarly, rutting males leave their herds during the mating season, hence altering the herd composition. Large herds were most common in monsoon, observed foraging in the grasslands. Predators of the chital include wolves, Bengal tigers, Asiatic lions, leopards, Indian rock pythons, dholes, Indian pariah dogs, and mugger crocodiles. Red foxes and golden jackals target juveniles. Males are less vulnerable than females and juveniles. A vocal animal, the chital, akin to the North American elk, gives out bellows and alarm barks. Its calls are, however, not as strong as those of elk or red deer; they are mainly coarse bellows or loud growls. Bellowing coincides with rutting.Mishra, H. and Wemmer, C. 1987. \\"The comparative breeding ecology of four cervids in Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal\\". Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press. Dominant males guarding females in oestrus make high-pitched growls at less powerful males. Males may moan during aggressive displays or while resting. The chital, mainly females and juveniles, bark persistently when alarmed or if they encounter a predator. Fawns in search of their mother often squeal. The chital can respond to the alarm calls of several animals such as the common myna and langurs. Marking behaviour is pronounced in males. Males have well-developed preorbital glands (near the eyes). They stand on their hind legs to reach tall branches and rub the open preorbital glands to deposit their scent there. This posture is also used while foraging. Urine marking is also observed; the smell of urine is typically stronger than that of the deposited scent. Sparring between males begins with the larger male displaying his dominance before the other; this display consists of hissing heading away from the other male with the tail facing him, the nose pointing to the ground, the ears down, the antlers upright, and the upper lip raised. The fur often bristles during the display. The male approaches the other in a slow gait. Males with velvet antlers may hunch over instead of standing erect as the males with hard antlers. The opponents then interlock their horns and push against each other, with the smaller male producing a sound at times which is louder than that produced by sambar deer, but not as much as the barasinga's. The fight terminates with the males stepping backward, or simply leaving and foraging. Fights are not generally serious. Individuals may occasionally bite one another. Common mynas are often attracted to the chital. An interesting relationship has been observed between herds of chital and troops of the northern plains grey langurs, a widespread South Asian monkey. Chital benefit from the langurs' eyesight and ability to post a lookout from trees, while the langur benefit from the chital's strong sense of smell, both of which help keep a check on potential danger. The chital also benefit from fruits dropped by langurs from trees such as Terminalia bellirica and Phyllanthus emblica. The chital has been observed foraging with sambar deer in the Western Ghats. ===Diet=== Chital graze when grasses are available, else they browse. Grazers as well as browsers, the chital mainly feed on grasses throughout the year. They prefer young shoots, in the absence of which, tall and coarse grasses are nibbled off at the tips. Browse forms a major portion of the diet only in the winter- October to January-when the grasses, tall or dried up, are no longer palatable. Browse includes herbs, shrubs, foliage, fruits, and forbs; Moghania species are often preferred while browsing. Fruits eaten by chital in the Kanha National Park (Madhya Pradesh, India) include those of Ficus species from January to May, Cordia myxa from May to June, and Syzygium cumini from June to July. Individuals tend to group together and forage while moving slowly. Chital are generally silent when grazing together. Males often stand on their hindlegs to reach tall branches. Water holes are visited nearly twice daily, with great caution. In the Kanha National Park, mineral licks rich in calcium and phosphorus pentoxide were scraped at by the incisors. Chital in the Sunderbans may be omnivores; remains of red crabs have been found in the rumen of individuals. ===Reproduction=== Breeding takes place throughout the year, with peaks that vary geographically. Sperm is produced year-round, though testosterone levels register a fall during the development of the antlers. Females have regular oestrus cycles, each lasting three weeks. The female can conceive again two weeks to four months after the birth. Males sporting hard antlers are dominant over those in velvet or those without antlers, irrespective of their size. Courtship is based on tending bonds. A rutting male fasts during the mating season and follows and guards a female in oestrus. The pair does several bouts of chasing and mutual licking before copulation. The newborn is hidden for a week after birth, a period much shorter than most other deer. The mother-fawn bond is not very strong, as the two get separated often, though they can reunite easily as the herds are cohesive. If the fawn dies, the mother can breed once again so as to give birth twice that year. The males continue their growth till seven to eight years. The average lifespan in captivity is nearly 22 years. The longevity in the wild, however, is merely five to ten years. The chital is found in large numbers in dense deciduous or semievergreen forests and open grasslands. The highest numbers of chital are found in the forests of India, where they feed upon tall grass and shrubs. Chital have been also spotted in Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary in Bhutan, which has the only remaining natural sal (Shorea robusta) forest in the country. They do not occur at high altitudes, where they are usually replaced by other species such as the sambar deer. They also prefer heavy forest cover for shade and avoid direct sunlight.

Artiodactyla. In: D. E. Wilson and D. M. Reeder (eds), Mammal Species of the World. A Taxonomic and Geographic Reference (3rd ed), pp. 637‚Äì722. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, USA. The western limit of its range is eastern Rajasthan and Gujarat. The northern limit is along the Bhabar-terai belt of the foothills of the Himalaya and from Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal through to Nepal, northern West Bengal and Sikkim and then to western Assam and the forested valleys of Bhutan, which are below 1,100 m asl. The eastern limit of its range is through western AssamGee, E.P. (1964). The wild life of India, Collins, LondonChoudhury, A.U. (1994). Checklist of the mammals of Assam. Gibbon Books, Guwahati, India. . to the Sunderbans of West Bengal (India) and Bangladesh. Sri Lanka is the southern limit. Chital occur sporadically in the forested areas throughout the rest of the Indian peninsula.Sankar, K. and Acharya, B. 2004. Chital (Axis axis (Erxleben, 1777)). ENVIS Bulletin (Wildlife Institute of India, Dehra Dun) 7: 171‚Äì180. Within Bangladesh, it currently only exists in the Sundarbans and some ecoparks situated around the Bay of Bengal, as it became extinct in the central and north-east of the country. ===Australia=== The chital was the first species of deer introduced into Australia in the early 1800s by Dr. John Harris, surgeon to the New South Wales Corps, and he had about 400 of these animals on his property by 1813. These did not survive and the primary range of the chital is now confined to a few cattle stations in North Queensland near Charters Towers and several feral herds on the NSW north coast. While some of the stock originated from Sri Lanka (Ceylon), the Indian race likely is also represented. ===The United States=== In the 1860s, axis deer were introduced to the island of Molokai, Hawaii, as a gift from Hong Kong to King Kamehameha V. The deer were introduced to Lanai, another of the Hawaiian Islands, soon afterward and are now plentiful on both islands. The deer were introduced to Maui island in the 1950s to increase hunting opportunities. Because the deer have no natural predators on the Hawaiian islands, their population is growing 20 to 30% each year, causing serious damage to agriculture and natural areas. Releasing them on the island of Hawaii was planned, as well, but this was abandoned after pressure from scientists over damage to landscapes caused by the deer on other islands. In 2012, deer were spotted on the island of Hawaii; wildlife officials believe people had flown the deer by helicopter and transported them by boat onto the island. In August 2012, a helicopter pilot pleaded guilty to transporting four axis deer from Maui to Hawaii. Hawaiian law now prohibits \\"the intentional possession or interisland transportation or release of wild or feral deer.\\" In 1932, axis deer were introduced to Texas. In 1988, self- sustaining herds were found in 27 counties, located in Central and South Texas. The deer are most populous on the Edwards Plateau, where the land is similar to that of India. ===Croatia=== Chital of unknown genetic origin were introduced to Brijuni Island in 1911, where they still occur today. They can also be found on Rab Island, and the population on the two islands amounts to some 200 individuals. Attempts by hunters to introduce the species to the mainland of Croatia were unsuccessful. ==Conservation status== The chital is listed by the IUCN as being of least concern \\"because it occurs over a very wide range within which there are many large populations\\". Currently, no range-wide threats to chitals are present, and they live in many protected areas. However, population densities are below ecological carrying capacity in many places due to hunting and competition with domestic livestock. Hunting for the deer's meat has caused substantial declines and local extinctions. The axis deer is protected under Schedule III of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972) and under the Wildlife (Preservation) (Amendment) Act, 1974 of Bangladesh. Two primary reasons for its good conservation status are its legal protection as a species and a network of functioning protected areas. The chital has been introduced to Andaman Islands, Australia, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, the Point Reyes National Seashore in California, Texas, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, and Hawaii in the United States, and to the Veliki Brijun Island in the Brijuni Archipelago of the Istrian Peninsula in Croatia.First record of the invasive alien species Axis axis (Erxleben, 1777) (Artiodactyla: Cervidae) in BrazilCiervo Axis (Axis axis) == Gallery == File:Spotted deer by Dharani Prakash.jpgSpotted deer near Coimbatore File:Flickr - Rainbirder - Cheetal Stag.jpgSri Lanka File:Axis axis Kanha 4kl.jpgKanha National Park, India File:Chital young 1.jpgA young chital hiding behind its mother File:Deer Sudarnakhali Sundarbans.JPGHerd grazing while one (on left) keeps watch at Sudarnakhali, Sundarbans File:Deers chilling.jpgHerd of chital does at Ranthambore National park File:Axisdeer-tobudobutsuen-2012.ogvA Chital in captivity ==See also== * Sri Lankan axis deer ==References== ==External links== * Category:Cervines Category:Fauna of South Asia Category:Mammals of Bangladesh Category:Mammals of Asia Category:Introduced mammals of Australia Category:Mammals of India Category:Mammals of Nepal Category:Mammals described in 1777 Category:Taxa named by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Introduced animals of Hawaii ","title":"Chital"},{"id":"1436150","text":"A plasma torch cutter A plasma torch (also known as a plasma arc, plasma gun, or plasma cutter, plasmatron) is a device for generating a directed flow of plasma.http://www.pjoes.com/Energy-Recovery-from-Waste-of-Printed-Circuit-r- nBoards-in-Plasmatron-Plasma-Reactor,89193,0,2.html The plasma jet can be used for applications including plasma cutting, plasma arc welding, plasma spraying, and plasma gasification for waste disposal. ==Types of thermal plasma torches== Thermal plasmas are generated in plasma torches by direct current (DC), alternating current (AC), radio-frequency (RF) and other discharges. DC torches are the most commonly used and researched, because when compared to AC: \\"there is less flicker generation and noise, a more stable operation, better control, a minimum of two electrodes, lower electrode consumption, slightly lower refractory [heat] wear and lower power consumption\\". ===Thermal plasma DC torches, non-transferred arc, based on hot cathode=== Cross-sectional representation of a non-transferred DC plasma torch. Showing the pointed cathode and annular anode. The inlets and outlets of the water-cooling system are labelled, note that the arc temperature can be up to 15 000¬∞C. The plasma arc is drawn for illustration purposes only. Not to scale. In a DC torch, the electric arc is formed between the electrodes (which can be made of copper, tungsten, graphite, molybdenum, silver etc.), and the thermal plasma is formed from the continual input of carrier/working gas, projecting outward as a plasma jet/flame (as can be seen in the adjacent image). In DC torches, the carrier gas can be, for example, either oxygen, nitrogen, argon, helium, air, or hydrogen; and although termed such, it does not have to be a gas (thus, better termed a carrier fluid). For example, a research plasma torch at the Institute of Plasma Physics (IPP) in Prague, Czech Republic, functions with an H2O vortex (as well as a small addition of argon to ignite the arc), and produces a high temperature/velocity plasma flame. In fact, early studies of arc stabilization employed a water-vortex. Overall, the electrode materials and carrier fluids have to be specifically matched to avoid excessive electrode corrosion or oxidation (and contamination of materials to be treated), while maintaining ample power and function. Furthermore, the flow-rate of the carrier gas can be raised to promote a larger, more projecting plasma jet, provided that the arc current is sufficiently increased; and vice versa. The plasma flame of a real plasma torch is a few inches long at most; it is to be distinguished from fictional long-range plasma weapons. ==== Transferred vs. non-transferred ==== There are two types of DC torches: non-transferred and transferred. In non-transferred DC torches, the electrodes are inside the body/housing of the torch itself (creating the arc there). Whereas in a transferred torch one electrode is outside (and is usually the conductive material to be treated), allowing the arc to form outside of the torch over a larger distance. A benefit of transferred DC torches is that the plasma arc is formed outside the water- cooled body, preventing heat loss‚Äîas is the case with non-transferred torches, where their electrical-to-thermal efficiency can be as low as 50%, but the hot water can itself be utilized. Furthermore, transferred DC torches can be used in a twin-torch setup, where one torch is cathodic and the other anodic, which has the earlier benefit of a regular transferred single-torch system, but allows their use with non-conductive materials, as there is no need for it to form the other electrode. However, these types of setups are rare as most common non-conductive materials do not require the precise cutting ability of a plasma torch. In addition, the discharge generated by this particular plasma source configuration is characterized by a complex shape and fluid dynamics that requires a 3D description in order to be predicted, making performance unsteady. The electrodes of non-transferred torches are larger, because they suffer more wear by the plasma arc. The quality of plasma produced is a function of density (pressure), temperature and torch power (the greater the better). With regards to the efficiency of the torch itself‚Äîthis can vary among manufacturers and torch technology; though for example, Leal-Quir√≥s reports that for Westinghouse Plasma Corp. torches ‚Äúa thermal efficiency of 90% is easily possible; the efficiency represents the percentage of arc power that exits the torch and enters the process‚Äù.

Four of her siblings had been born in Bermuda: Albert Albouy Outerbridge (1841-); Sir Joseph Outerbridge (1843-1933); August Emelius Outerbridge (1846‚ÄìJanuary 14, 1921); Catherine Tucker Outerbridge (1846-). Her other siblings were Harriett Harvey Outerbridge; Alexander Ewing Outerbridge II; Laura Catharine Outerbridge; Adolph John Harvey Outerbridge (1858‚ÄìMay 29, 1928) and Eugenius Harvey Outerbridge, who was the first president of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. ==Bermuda and tennis== The modern game of lawn tennis was first commercialized in 1874 in England by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield of the British Army. One of the Major's men brought the rules for the game and the equipment with him when he was posted to the Bermuda Garrison in 1874. Mary played the game at \\"Clermont\\", her family's house with a large flat lawn in Paget parish in Bermuda. In 1874 Mary returned from Bermuda aboard the ship \\"S.S. Canima.\\" The sporting equipment was originally confiscated by customs officials, but then her brother managed to have the supplies released. She introduced lawn tennis to the United States. She set up the first tennis court in the United States on the grounds of the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club, which was near where the Staten Island Ferry Terminal is today. The club was founded on or about March 22, 1872. She played the first tennis game in the US against her sister Laura in Staten Island, New York, on an hourglass-shaped court. In September 1880 the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club held \\"the tournament for the championship of America\\". The match was won by O. E. Woodhouse of England who was in New York at the time. Woodhouse defeated I. F. Hellmuth in the championship finals. Several other clubs held similar tournaments in the same year. In the same year tennis was also introduced in Arizona. ==Home life== In 1880 Mary and her parents were living in the Castleton area of Staten Island, New York City and her father was working as a clerk, as was her brother, Adolph. The family had two servants.Outerbridges in the 1880 US Census for Staten Island ==Death and burial== She died in 1886 at age 34 in the New Brighton section of Staten Island and was buried in Silver Mount Cemetery, Staten Island, next to her parents. ==Legacy== Mary Outerbridge was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1981. She was inducted into the Staten Island Sports Hall of Fame in 1999. In 2018, the New York Times published a belated obituary for her as part of the Overlooked history project. ==See also== * James Dwight * History of tennis * 1880 Men's Tennis Tour * ==Footnotes== ==Further reading== * Amisha Padnani, \\"Mary Ewing Outerbridge, 1852-1886,\\" New York Times, March 8, 2018. ==External links== *Findagrave: Mary Outerbridge *International Tennis Hall of Fame Category:American tennis people Category:Tennis people from Pennsylvania Category:International Tennis Hall of Fame inductees Category:American people of Bermudian descent Category:Sportspeople from Philadelphia Category:Sportspeople from Staten Island Category:1852 births Category:1886 deaths Category:History of tennis ","title":"Mary Ewing Outerbridge"},{"id":"1436171","text":"Michael Weiss (born 1958), is a jazz pianist and composer best known for his fifteen-year association with saxophonist Johnny Griffin. Weiss was born in Dallas, Texas. After completing a bachelor of music degree from Indiana University, Weiss moved to New York City in 1982. He toured that year with singer Jon Hendricks. He has worked with George Coleman, Art Farmer, Johnny Griffin, Slide Hampton, Tom Harrell, Jimmy Heath, Charles McPherson, and Gerry Mulligan. In 2000 he was the grand prize winner in the BMI/Thelonious Monk Institute's Composers Competition. In 1989, he won second prize in the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Piano Competition, and in 2002, he received a composition commission from Chamber Music America. As a soloist and bandleader, Weiss has been featured on the television and radio programs CBS News Nightwatch, Live from Lincoln Center, Jazzset, Piano Jazz, and the Jazz Piano Christmas Special. In addition to performing, composing and recording, Weiss has been committed to jazz education throughout his career. Weiss presented a New York tribute concert to Horace Silver, who he credits as \\"one of his earliest and longest lasting influences.\\" ==Critical response== Writing about Weiss's album Soul Journey in All About Jazz, Dan McClenaghan said, \\"It's the songs, though, that star on Soul Journey. And though Weiss doesn't call attention to himself as an instrumentalist, additional listens reveal a richness to his own solos, a smooth and understated eloquence.\\" Reviewing Soul Journey for All About Jazz, Chris Hovan said, \\"What will come as a revelation is the transformation that the pieces have made now that they‚Äôve been fleshed out even further by Weiss for this larger ensemble.\\" Writing for Jazz Review of a performance by Johnny Griffin, in which Weiss played panio, Ben Ratliff said, \\"With the band playing beautifully behind him, he played a set like many he has played before, ... The set had tentative moments, but he ended fully on his feet, and it was as good a demonstration of blues phrasing as can be heard in jazz.\\" Writing a review of the album Power Station for Jazz Times, Sid Gribetz said, \\"Weiss is an excellent pianist who plays bebop and hard-bop lines with elegance and precision. He has a deft touch and swinging rhythmic sense, with the right dollop of funk and soul.\\" Gribetz went on to mention Weiss's long association with Johnny Griffin. ==Discography== ===As leader=== * Presenting Michael Weiss (1986, Criss Cross, 1986) * Power Station (DIW, 1998) * Milestones (SteepleChase, 2000) * Soul Journey (Sintra, 2003) ===As sideman=== With Johnny Griffin * Take My Hand (Who's Who in Jazz, 1988) * The Cat (Antilles, 1990) * Dance of Passion (Antilles, 1992) * Johnny Griffin & Steve Grossman Quintet (Dreyfus, 2000) With Frank Wess * Body and Soul (Grave News, 2005) * Once Is Not Enough (Labeth Music, 2009) With Vanguard Jazz Orchestra * Monday Night Live at the Village Vanguard (Planet Arts, 2008) * Forever Lasting ‚Äì Live in Tokyo (Planet Arts, 2011) With others * Georgie Fame, Cool Cat Blues (Blue Moon/Bean Bag Entertainment, 1991) * Nathen Page, The Other Page (1991, Hugo's Music) * Charles McPherson, First Flight Out (Arabesque, 1994) * Ronnie Cuber, N.Y.C.ats (SteepleChase, 1997) * Doug Raney, Back in New York (SteepleChase, 1997) * Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra, Big Band Treasures Live (1997, Smithsonian Folkways) * Louis Smith, The Bopsmith (SteepleChase, 2001) * Eszter Balint, Mud (Bar/None, 2004) * Dick Oatts, Two Hearts (SteepleChase, 2010) ==References== ==External links== *MichaelWeiss.info - Official website Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Post-bop pianists Category:Hard bop pianists Category:American jazz composers Category:American male jazz composers Category:American jazz pianists Category:American male pianists Category:Musicians from Dallas Category:Indiana University alumni Category:20th-century American pianists Category:Jazz musicians from Texas Category:21st-century American pianists Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:21st-century American male musicians Category:The Jazztet members ","title":"Michael Weiss (pianist)"},{"id":"1436192","text":"Sir Thomas Lake (1561 ‚Äì 17 September 1630) was Secretary of State to James I of England. He was a Member of Parliament between 1593 and 1626. Thomas Lake was baptised in Southampton on 11 October 1561, the son of Almeric Lake, a minor customs official: his obscure birth was a source of much unkind comment by his enemies throughout his life. Arthur Lake, Bishop of Bath and Wells, was his older brother. He attended King Edward VI School, Southampton as a day boy. This meant that he did not have the level of French language tuition accorded to boarders by his Belgian schoolmaster Adrian Saravia, which was a source of regret to him in later life. He did, however, gain excellent fluency in Latin. ==Career== He was an MP for Malmesbury in 1593, New Romney in 1601, Launceston in 1604, Middlesex in 1614 and Wootton Bassett in 1626. He became the personal secretary of Sir Francis Walsingham, the Secretary of State, and was nicknamed 'Swiftsure' for his speed and accuracy. Walsingham brought Lake to the attention of Queen Elizabeth I and he was appointed Clerk of the Signet in 1600. As one of the Queen's favourites he travelled with her reading Latin texts to her on her progresses around the country. On 28 March 1603, four days after the death of Elizabeth I of England the Privy Council sent him to Scotland with George Carew to inform James I of the current state of affairs and reiterate their urgent desire that the King should come to England. He was a prot√©g√© of the Howard family and became a favourite of James, who appointed him Secretary of the Latin Tongue and Keeper of the Records and then knighted him in 1603. He acted as the King's travelling secretary just as he had for Walsingham. His brother Arthur was one of the translators of the King James Bible appointed in 1604‚Äîthe year that the reversion of Great Stanmore Manor in Middlesex was granted to Lake, although it seems that he never took possession for the lordship remained in the name of the Burnell family until his son Thomas assumed possession in 1631. The adjoining manor of Little Stanmore contained the lands known as Canons, which Lake also acquired in 1604 and on which he built the grand brick mansion called Cannons to a design ascribed to John Thorpe. Bribery was endemic at the time and Lake's position with the King made him a target for many bribes (the Bishop of Llandaff offered Lake ¬£80 for his help in securing a position) but he was not averse to bribery on his own behalf. When Lord Salisbury, Walsingham's successor as Secretary of State, died in 1612, Lake desperately wanted the job and tried to bribe his way into it but James would not appoint Lake immediately and filled the post himself for a time. It was also in 1612 that Lake came to regret not having boarded at his school, which would have enabled him to profit from the headmaster's tutorials in French. The King's daughter, Princess Elizabeth was betrothed to a German prince, Frederick V of the Palatinate, and Lake was chosen to read the marriage contract aloud. It was written in French and his accent was so bad and his translation into English so inept that he made a fool of himself. It did not do lasting harm to his career, however. On 29 March 1614/5 Lake was taken into the Privy Council and on 3 January 1615/6 James swore him in as one of the two principal royal secretaries so that both he and Sir Ralph Winwood were Secretary of State. == Scandal and the Secretary of State == Lake's discretion was not always to be relied on. In 1619 he relayed to the Earl of Suffolk remarks that the King had made to him privately about Suffolk's wife, Katherine Knyvet. The King was gravely displeased, and Lake offered the Marquess of Buckingham, the King's favourite ¬£15,000 to help him regain the King's friendship. Buckingham refused but later yielded to Lake's pleas. ===The Roos affair === Ultimately, Lake's career was nearly ruined by his involvement in a bitter family quarrel. On 12 February 1616/17 Lake's eldest child Anne was married to William Cecil, 16th Baron de Ros, but the marriage did not last. During the marriage, Cecil had mortgaged some of his land to Lake and following the divorce Lake claimed this for his daughter. Cecil's grandfather, Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter, contested the request and a vicious dispute ensued. Lake's eldest son, Sir Arthur Lake violently attacked Cecil. Lake's wife and daughter then threatened to accuse Cecil of having an affair with his grandfather's young second wife. This charge was entirely false but when Cecil fled to Rome, Anne Lake forged incriminating letters. Lady Exeter charged Lake, his wife, his son and his daughter with defamation of character. Anne was accused of \\"precontracts, adultery, incest, murder, poison\\" against her husband, Lord Roos. As part of the legal action, Lake and his wife submitted a bill to the Star Chamber, which was defended by Lord Roos who counter-sued with a bill submitted by his grandfather, the Earl of Exeter. On 14 February 1617/18, the King expressed his annoyance with Lake because of Lady Roos' slanders against Frances Brydges Smith Cecil, Countess of Exeter. On 22 February Lady Roos was committed into the Bishop of London's custody, her maid to the custody of Edmund Doubleday, and Thomas Lake's attorney and Luke Hutton were imprisoned. Lady Roos was freed on 5 March. King James chose to judge the case in person, adjudicating the trial in the Star Chamber in two morning sessions on 3 and 5 February 1619/20. The King found them all guilty, although he found Lake himself guilty of less serious crimes than the others. The King and the Lords in the Star Chamber passed sentence on 13 February 1619/20. Huge fines exceeding ¬£10,000 were imposed upon the family and two days later Lake, his wife, and Lady Roos his daughter were consigned to the Tower. The fines were almost all due to the Crown and little compensation was offered to Lady Exeter. Lake also had to surrender his seal and public documents. One of his duties while confined to the tower was the chopping of wood. On 21 April Lake's son and secretary William was put in custody because he attempted to pass secret letters to Lady Roos and tried to escape when accosted and on 3 June Arthur Lake was placed in custody having published a slanderous pamphlet. But the misbehaviour was not confined to the Lakes: Parker, Clerk of the Star Chamber, was also incarcerated on 3 June because he acted in bad faith in examining Lady Roos. On 19 June Lake was brought back to the Star Chamber and told that he must make a public confession that the sentence brought against him was just, and that he had inflicted an injury upon the Countess of Exeter. He pleaded not guilty; so too did his wife, even though their daughter had confessed that her slanders about incest with Lady Roos, poisoning, and requests for forgiveness for crimes were inventions written by Arthur Lake and copied by Hobbie, Lady Roos' maid, with her father and mother accomplices. The King considered this to be the height of contempt against his Royal Majesty but a month later he agreed to free Lake from prison and put him in the custody of his brother Arthur, Bishop of Bath and Wells. Lake's daughter was also freed. Lake did not leave the Tower immediately; he chose to stay there a while longer to arrange his private affairs. On 28 January 1620/21, back in the Star Chamber Lake read out an acknowledgement of the slanders by which he had done damage to the Countess of Exeter. This acknowledgment or act of submission was devised by the Lord Chancellor, Chief Justices, and Attorney General. In this, > for the defence and support of Lady Roos his daughter, he acknowledged that > the sentence handed down against him on the preceding 13 February, was just, > because his fault was disgraceful, hateful, and scandalous to the said > Countess. But he was misled by his great credulilty, indulgence, and > ignorance. Furthermore he acknowledged that he had erred in incarcerating > Luke Hutton on 22 February 1618 and George Williams out of self-interest, > and professed that it grieved him to his heart to have defended such a > disgraceful, hateful, and scandalous case.possibly Lake's attorney or Sir > George Williams, the Elizabethan courtier who reported on his audiences with > Henry IV of France, MS British Library Cotton Caligula E. viii. Rymer's f. > 170 Begging the Countess' forgiveness, he sincerely petitioned the Lords to > intercede with the King for favour and mercy. Intriguingly, on 22 February William Camden notes in his diary that: \\"Peacock of Cambridge, who had claimed he had employed magical tricks to sway the King's mind from sound judgement in the case of Thomas Lake, is put to torture in the Tower of London. Some pronounced him a madman, others an impostor.\\" On 10 March Lake's wife was temporarily freed from the Tower \\"because of her ill health, under the condition that at the beginning of term she be returned unless she has made her submission\\". Lake finally kissed the royal hand on 15 May but his wife stubbornly refused to make her submission and remained in the Tower after his release. She was still there on 27 September when Lake was struck by a vehicle and broke his arm and on 16 November when she was to be brought to the Star Chamber to acknowledge her offence against the Countess of Exeter, \\"she wrote a letter to her derogatory to the kingdom's justice, and, quoting verses from Psalm 136, summoned the Countess to Divine Judgement,\\" and hence was returned to the Tower. A month later on 14 December she was freed from prison without public explanation. ==Later life == Lake did not return to his post as Secretary of State but he and the King were reconciled and he was readmitted to Court. In 1625 he was elected MP for Wells in 1625 and in the 1626 he became MP for Wooton, which position he until his death on 17 September 1630. He was survived by his widow, Mary (daughter of Sir William Ryder, Lord Mayor of London, and a first cousin of John Ryder, Anglican Bishop of Killaloe), three sons, Arthur (died 1633), Thomas (died 1653) and Lancelot (died 1680), and four daughters, including Lady Roos (who had remarried George Rodney) and Bridget, who married Sir William Domville, Attorney General for Ireland. It is inevitable that anyone who was so favoured by the King attracts envy. A fellow courtier described him as a 'mean fellow, of mean birth and meaner breeding'; but the King said of Lake: 'He was a Minister of State fit to serve the greatest prince in Europe.' ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * Category:1561 births Category:1630 deaths Category:People from Southampton Category:People educated at King Edward VI School, Southampton Category:16th- century English people Category:Secretaries of State of the Kingdom of England Category:English MPs 1604‚Äì1611 Category:English MPs 1614 Category:English MPs 1625 Category:English MPs 1626 ","title":"Thomas Lake"},{"id":"1436195","text":"Thomas Joseph Dodd (May 15, 1907 ‚Äì May 24, 1971) was an American diplomat who served as a United States Senator and Representative from Connecticut, He is the father of former U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd and Thomas J. Dodd, Jr., who served as the United States Ambassador to Uruguay from 1993 to 1997 and to Costa Rica from 1997 to 2001. ==Early life== Dodd was born in Norwich, New London County, to Abigail Margaret (n√©e O'Sullivan) and Thomas Joseph Dodd, a building contractor; all four of his grandparents were immigrants from Ireland. His paternal grandparents were farmers in the Housatonic river valley with large commercial tobacco leaf farms located near Kent and New Milford. He graduated from Saint Anselm College's preparatory school, run by Benedictine monks in Goffstown, New Hampshire, in 1926. He graduated from Providence College in 1930 with a degree in philosophy, and from Yale Law School in 1933. In 1934, Dodd married Grace Murphy of Westerly, Rhode Island. They had six children. He served as a special agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1933 and 1934, the highlight of his career there being his participation in an unsuccessful attempt to capture John Dillinger at Little Bohemia Lodge.Dodd, Thomas in American National Biography, American Council of Learned Societies, 2000. He was then Connecticut director of the National Youth Administration from 1935 to 1938. He was assistant to five successive United States Attorneys General (Homer Cummings, Frank Murphy, Robert Jackson, Francis Biddle and Tom Clark) from 1938 to 1945. As a special agent for the Attorney General, Dodd was basically a trial-level federal prosecutor. He worked primarily on criminal and civil liberties cases, including the prosecution of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1930s. In 1942, he was sent to Hartford to prosecute a major spy ring case in which five men (Anastasy Vonsiatsky, Wilhelm Kunze, and others) were accused of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 by conspiring to gather and deliver US Army, Navy, and defense information to Germany or Japan. Four of the five pleaded guilty; Dodd tried and won the conviction of the fifth man, Reverend Kurt Emil Bruno Molzahn. Dodd became vice chairman of the Board of Review and later executive trial counsel for the Office of the United States Chief of Counsel for the Prosecution of Axis Criminality at Nuremberg, Germany, in 1945 and 1946. He practiced law privately in Hartford, Connecticut, from 1947 to 1953. ==Nuremberg Trials== Both Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson, chief prosecutor for the U.S., and Dodd insisted upon a fair and legal trial to prosecute the Nazi war criminals. Dodd accepted Jackson's offer to join him in Germany. Dodd expected the position to last only several months, but he wound up spending 15 months there. Dodd suggested Heidelberg as the location for the International Military Tribunal, since it had survived the war almost completely unscathed, but Nuremberg was eventually chosen. In October 1945, Jackson named Dodd to his senior Trial Board for the Nuremberg Trials, and later in 1946, named him Executive Trial Counsel, putting him in the number-two position at the trials. In the summer of 1946, Jackson appointed Dodd as the acting Chief of Counsel while he returned to DC. Dodd finally returned to the U.S. in October 1946. He described the delegation as \\"an autopsy on history's most horrible catalogue of human crime.\\" Dodd cross-examined defendants Wilhelm Keitel, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank, Walther Funk, Baldur von Schirach, Fritz Sauckel and Arthur Seyss-Inquart. In addition to cross-examining, Dodd drafted indictments against the defendants, showed films of concentration camps, provided evidence of slave labor programs, and presented evidence of economic preparations by the Nazis for an aggressive war. Dodd showed through his evidence that Erich Koch, the Reichkommissioner for the Ukraine and defendant Hans Frank, the Governor-General of Poland were responsible for the plan to deport one million Poles for slave labor. Dodd also showed evidence that defendant Walther Funk turned the Reichsbank into a depository for gold teeth and other valuables seized from the concentration camp victims. Dodd showed a motion picture of the vaults in Frankfurt where Allied troops found cases of these valuables, containing dentures, earrings, silverware and candelabra. Dodd showed many gruesome items of evidence, such as a shrunken, stuffed and preserved human head of one of the concentration camp victims that had been used as a paperweight by the commandant of Buchenwald Concentration Camp. Final pleas were made on August 31, 1946, and the Tribunal announced its judgment in September 1946. Dodd assisted the Allied prosecuting team of convicting all but three of the defendants. All but one of the defendants had claimed innocence, including Hermann G√∂ring, whom Dodd had charged with ordering Reinhard Heydrich to set the Holocaust in motion. In addition to prosecuting the individual defendants, Dodd demanded in his summation to the Tribunal that all six of the indicted Nazi organizations be convicted of crimes against humanity, on the same grounds of the crimes against humanity ascribed to the individual defendants. These six organizations are the Leadership Corps, the Reich cabinet, the Gestapo, The Storm Troops (SA), the Armed Forces, and the Elite Guard (SS). Dodd said that these organizations should not escape liability on the grounds that they were too large, part of a political party, etc. Dodd was given several awards in recognition of his work at the Nuremberg trials. Jackson awarded him the Medal of Freedom in July 1946 and President Harry Truman awarded him the Certificate of Merit, which Jackson personally delivered to him in Hartford in the fall of 1946. Dodd also received the Czechoslovak Order of the White Lion. In 1949, the Polish government had intended to award Dodd with a badge of honor called the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, but Dodd rejected the medal due to his commitment to human rights and views that the Polish government was imposing a tyranny similar to that imposed by the Nazis, and accepting an honor from the President of Poland would be like accepting one from the Nazis. ==Congress== Dodd was elected as a Democrat to the House of Representatives in 1952 and served two terms. He lost a Senate election in 1956 to Prescott S. Bush but was elected in 1958 to Connecticut's other Senate seat and then re-elected in 1964. Before becoming a U.S. senator, Dodd was hired to lobby for Guatemala in the United States for $50,000 a year by the dictator Carlos Castillo Armas. According to the North American Congress on Latin America, Dodd \\"had perhaps the coziest relationship with the Castillo Armas government.\\"North American Congress on Latin America. \\"Guatemala\\", North American Congress on Latin America, Berkeley, 1974, p. 84-85. After a short trip to Guatemala in 1955, Dodd urged the House of Representatives to increase aid to the country in Central America. Dodd's amendment passed and Guatemala received $15 million of US aid in 1956. Dodd was unapologetic when criticized for his lobbying efforts on behalf of the Guatemalan dictatorship. When a Republican organizer challenged Dodd on his lobbying, Dodd stated, \\"I am a practicing attorney and I am proud of the fact that the anti-communist government of Guatemala has asked me to handle its legal affairs in the US. Of course I will not represent the government of Guatemala or any other private client if I am elected to the Senate.\\" In 1961, Dodd visited the Congo to investigate the civil war caused by the secession of the Province of Katanga. In addition to his work in the Congo, Dodd opened what became nearly three years of intermittent hearings. The results of the three committee staff monitoring reports of television content in 1954, 1961, and 1964 showed incidents of violence. Senator Dodd and Estes Kefauver were the two men responsible for informing the public of the effects of violence on juveniles.Sterling, Christopher Hastings., and John Michael. Kittross. Stay Tuned: a Concise History of American Broadcasting. Belmont, Calif: Wadsworth, 1990. Print. In 1964, Dodd was locked in a somewhat bitter and tough re-election bid against popular former Governor John Davis Lodge, the younger brother of the Ambassador to South Vietnam and former U.S. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., who had just won a series of Republican presidential primaries, starting with New Hampshire earlier that year without campaigning but on the strength of the Lodge family name alone. Worried about that respectful allure might power his younger brother, Dodd reached out to President Lyndon B. Johnson for assistance. Johnson had been keeping his choice of running mate secret and so on the Wednesday of the Democratic National Convention, before the evening on which the running mate would be announced, Johnson summoned both Dodd and his colleague, whom Johnson had chosen to be his running mate, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota to the White House. While Dodd was never seriously considered for the running mate, the ensuing summons by the President of Dodd added a lot of suspense and free press to Dodd, who successfully used it to raise his name and record before the voters. It also allowed Johnson that much more excitement to a running mate slot, which had come down the press and public opinion between Humphrey and Minnesota's other senator, the urbane Eugene McCarthy. Aided in part by Johnson, who enthusiastically endorsed Dodd on a campaign swing through Connecticut later and then Johnson's subsequent landslide over Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, who seized the Republican presidential nomination from Lodge's brother and a number of other establishment Republicans, Dodd won his own landslide over the younger Lodge by 30%,1964 United States Senate election in Connecticut thereby shuttering the younger Lodge's nascent political career. In the fall of 1965, Dodd tried to get Martin Luther King Jr. arrested for violating the never-successfully used Logan Act of 1799, claiming that King's public stance against the Vietnam War was a felony per the Logan Act's intent of preventing unauthorized negotiations from undermining the government's position. As chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency, Dodd worked to restrict the purchase of mail order handguns and later shotguns and rifles. Those efforts culminated in the Gun Control Act of 1968, which Dodd introduced, including certain registration requirements. Dodd played an instrumental role in the prohibition of LSD in the United States by presiding over subcommittee hearings purportedly investigating the drug's effects on youth. Notably, the Harvard psychologist and LSD proponent Timothy Leary was called to testify. T Although Leary urged lawmakers to enact a strictly regulated framework in which LSD would remain legal, Dodd and his colleagues drafted a ban which was later adopted. That event was one episode in the prelude towards an all-out \\"War on Drugs\\" in the 1970s. ==Senate censure and loss of office== In 1967 Dodd became the first Senator censured by the US Senate since Joseph McCarthy in 1954,https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL30764.pdf and was one of only six people censured by the Senate in the 20th century. The resulting censure was a condemnation and finding that he had converted campaign funds to his personal accounts and spent the money. Beyond the Senate Ethics Committee's formal disciplinary action, other sources (such as investigative journalist Drew Pearson and Jack Anderson's Congress in Crisis) suggest. Dodd's corruption was far broader in scope, and there were accusations of alcoholism.. In response to these accusations, Dodd filed a lawsuit against Pearson claiming that Pearson had illegally interfered with his private property. Although the district court granted a partial judgment to Dodd, the appellate court ruled in favor of Pearson on the grounds that Dodd's property had not been physically abused.Pearson v. Dodd. 11 Prosser, Wade and Schwartz's Torts Cases and Materials 81-84. United States Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit. 1969. Print. In 1970, the Democrats endorsed for his seat Joseph Duffey, who won the nomination in the primary. Dodd then entered the race as an independent, taking just under a quarter of the vote, in a three-way race which he and Duffey lost to Republican Lowell Weicker. Dodd finished third, with 266,500 votes‚Äìfar exceeding Weicker's 86,600-vote margin over Duffey. ==Death and legacy== Months after his defeat, Dodd died from a heart attack at his home. His son Christopher Dodd was elected to the Senate as a Connecticut Democrat in 1980. Thomas J. Dodd Memorial Stadium in Norwich was named in his honor. In 1995, the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center was established at the University of Connecticut. The Thomas J. Dodd Research Center or Dodd Research Center houses the Human Rights Institute, Archives & Special Collections at the University of Connecticut Library, and the Center for Judaic Studies at the University of Connecticut.Dodd Center Website, In 2003, the University of Connecticut established the Thomas J. Dodd Prize in International Justice and Human Rights.Dodd Prize website, http://doddprize.uconn.edu/about.htm The state of New Hampshire proclaimed April 25, 2008, as Thomas J. Dodd Day; that same day, the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College renamed its Center for International Affairs as the Senator Thomas J. Dodd Center for the Study of International Affairs and Law. The center seeks to promote understanding of the forces that drive politics and the political economy in the global world; to sensitize students to the cultures of other countries, and to spur interest in the needs and problems of other nations and countries. ==In popular culture== He has been portrayed by the following actors in film, television and theater productions; * Hrothgar Mathews in the 2000 Canadian/U.S. television miniseries Nuremberg. *Rupert Vansittart in the 2006 British television docudrama Nuremberg: Nazis on Trial. *Protest singer Phil Ochs references Dodd in his song \\"Draft Dodger Rag\\": \\"I believe in God and Senator Dodd and keeping old Castro down.\\" ==See also== * List of United States Senators expelled or censured * List of federal political scandals in the United States ==ReferencesCategory:1907 births Category:1971 deaths Category:Politicians from Norwich, Connecticut Category:American people of Irish descent Category:Connecticut Democrats Category:Connecticut lawyers Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Connecticut Category:Providence College alumni Category:American anti-communists Category:United States senators from Connecticut Category:Yale Law School alumni Category:Censured or reprimanded United States senators Category:Dodd family Category:Democratic Party United States senators Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:20th-century American politicians Category:Saint Anselm College alumni ","title":"Thomas J.

It is viewed as any change or disturbance to the land perceived to be deleterious or undesirable.Johnson, D.L., S.H. Ambrose, T.J. Bassett, M.L. Bowen, D.E. Crummey, J.S. Isaacson, D.N. Johnson, P. Lamb, M. Saul, and A.E. Winter-Nelson. 1997. Meanings of environmental terms. Journal of Environmental Quality 26: 581‚Äì589. Natural hazards are excluded as a cause; however human activities can indirectly affect phenomena such as floods and bush fires. This is considered to be an important topic of the 21st century due to the implications land degradation has upon agricultural productivity, the environment, and its effects on food security. It is estimated that up to 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded. According to the Special Report on Climate Change and Land of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: \\"About a quarter of the Earth‚Äôs ice-free land area is subject to human-induced degradation (medium confidence). Soil erosion from agricultural fields is estimated to be currently 10 to 20 times (no tillage) to more than 100 times (conventional tillage) higher than the soil formation rate (medium confidence).\\". The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 15 has a target to restore degraded land and soil and achieve a land degradation-neutral world by 2030. ==Measures== There are four main ways of looking at land degradation and its impact on the environment around it: #A temporary or permanent decline in the productive capacity of the land. This can be seen through a loss of biomass, a loss of actual productivity or in potential productivity, or a loss or change in vegetative cover and soil nutrients. #Action in the land's capacity to provide resources for human livelihoods. This can be measured from a base line of past land use. #Loss of biodiversity: A loss of range of species or ecosystem complexity as a decline in the environmental quality. #Shifting ecological risk: increased vulnerability of the environment or people to destruction or crisis. This is measured through a base line in the form of pre-existing risk of crisis or destruction. A problem with defining land degradation is that what one group of people might view as degradation, others might view as a benefit or opportunity. For example, planting crops at a location with heavy rainfall and steep slopes would create scientific and environmental concern regarding the risk of soil erosion by water, yet farmers could view the location as a favourable one for high crop yields. == Different types == Potato field with soil erosion In addition to the usual types of land degradation that have been known for centuries (water, wind and mechanical erosion, physical, chemical and biological degradation), four other types have emerged in the last 50 years:Brabant Pierre, 2010. A land degradation assessment and mapping method. A standard guideline proposal. Les dossiers th√©matiques du CSFD. N¬∞8. November 2010. CSFD/Agropolis International, Montpellier, France. 52 pp. * pollution, often chemical, due to agricultural, industrial, mining or commercial activities; * loss of arable land due to urban construction, road building, land conversion, agricultural expansion, etc.; * artificial radioactivity, sometimes accidental; * land-use constraints associated with armed conflicts. Overall, more than 36 types of land degradation can be assessed. All are induced or aggravated by human activities, e.g. Soil erosion, Soil contamination, Soil acidification, sheet erosion, silting, aridification, salinization, urbanization, etc. ==Causes== Overgrazing by livestock can lead to land degradation Land degradation is a global problem largely related to agricultural use, deforestation and climate change. Causes include: * Land clearance, such as clearcutting and deforestation * Agricultural depletion of soil nutrients through poor farming practices * Livestock including overgrazing and overdrafting * Inappropriate irrigation and overdrafting * Urban sprawl and commercial development * Vehicle off-roading *Quarrying of stone, sand, ore and minerals * Increase in field size due to economies of scale, reducing shelter for wildlife, as hedgerows and copses disappear * Exposure of naked soil after harvesting by heavy equipment * Monoculture, destabilizing the local ecosystem * Dumping of non-biodegradable trash, such as plastics * Invasive Species * Climate Change * Loss of soil carbon Soil erosion in a wheat field near Pullman, US Overcutting of vegetation occurs when people cut forests, woodlands and shrublands‚Äîto obtain timber, fuelwood and other products‚Äîat a pace exceeding the rate of natural regrowth. This is frequent in semi-arid environments, where fuelwood shortages are often severe. Overgrazing is the grazing of natural pastures at stocking intensities above the livestock carrying capacity; the resulting decrease in the vegetation cover is a leading cause of wind and water erosion. It is a significant factor in Afghanistan. The growing population pressure, during 1980‚Äì1990, has led to decreases in the already small areas of agricultural land per person in six out of eight countries (14% for India and 21% for Pakistan). Population pressure also operates through other mechanisms. Improper agricultural practices, for instance, occur only under constraints such as the saturation of good lands under population pressure which leads settlers to cultivate too shallow or too steep soils, plough fallow land before it has recovered its fertility, or attempt to obtain multiple crops by irrigating unsuitable soils. High population density is not always related to land degradation. Rather, it is the practices of the human population that can cause a landscape to become degraded. Populations can be a benefit to the land and make it more productive than it is in its natural state. Land degradation is an important factor of internal displacement in many African and Asian countries.Terminski, Bogumil, Towards Recognition and Protection of Forced Environmental Migrants in the Public International Law: Refugee or IDPs Umbrella (December 1, 2011). Policy Studies Organization (PSO) Summit, December 2011 Severe land degradation affects a significant portion of the Earth's arable lands, decreasing the wealth and economic development of nations. As the land resource base becomes less productive, food security is compromised and competition for dwindling resources increases, the seeds of famine and potential conflict are sown. ===Climate change and land degradation=== According to the Special Report on Climate Change and Land of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate change in one of the causes of land degradation. The report state that: \\"Climate change exacerbates land degradation, particularly in lowlying coastal areas, river deltas, drylands and in permafrost areas (high confidence). Over the period 1961‚Äì2013, the annual area of drylands in drought has increased, on average by slightly more than 1% per year, with large inter-annual variability. In 2015, about 500 (380‚Äì620) million people lived within areas which experienced desertification between the year 1980s and 2000s. The highest numbers of people affected are in South and East Asia, the circum Sahara region including North Africa, and the Middle East including the Arabian Peninsula (low confidence). Other dryland regions have also experienced desertification. People living in already degraded or desertified areas are increasingly negatively affected by climate change (high confidence).\\" Additionally, it is claimed that 74 % of the poor are directly affected by land degradation globally. Significant land degradation from seawater inundation, particularly in river deltas and on low- lying islands, is a potential hazard that was identified in a 2007 IPCC report. As a result of sea-level rise from climate change, salinity levels can reach levels where agriculture becomes impossible in very low-lying areas. ==Sensitivity and resilience== Sensitivity and resilience are measures of the vulnerability of a landscape to degradation. These two factors combine to explain the degree of vulnerability. Sensitivity is the degree to which a land system undergoes change due to natural forces, human intervention or a combination of both. Resilience is the ability of a landscape to absorb change, without significantly altering the relationship between the relative importance and numbers of individuals and species that compose the community. It also refers to the ability of the region to return to its original state after being changed in some way. The resilience of a landscape can be increased or decreased through human interaction based upon different methods of land-use management. Land that is degraded becomes less resilient than undegraded land, which can lead to even further degradation through shocks to the landscape. ==See also== == References == == Further reading == * This article incorporates text in the public domain produced by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service * * D.L.

A Liberal, he was first elected as the Member of Parliament for Bramalea‚ÄîGore‚ÄîMalton in 1993, and served as its representative in the House of Commons for 18 consecutive years until his defeat in the 2011 election. Malhi is notable for being the first turban-wearing Sikh to be elected to the House of Commons of Canada, or any national legislature in the western world.http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/eppp-archive/100/205/300/liberal- ef/06-10-26/www.liberal.ca/members_e.aspx@id=5741 == Member of Parliament == Malhi was first elected to the House of Commons in the federal election of 1993, defeating Progressive Conservative (PC) incumbent Harry Chadwick and in the Peel Region riding of Bramalea‚ÄîGore‚ÄîMalton. Prior to 1993, Canadian law prohibited members of Parliament from wearing headgear of any sort in the House of Commons. Malhi's insistence on wearing a turban caused the law to be changed shortly after the election. Malhi was re-elected in the 1997 election over Reform candidate Darlene Florence and PC candidate Beryl Ford. He was re- elected with the greatest majority of his career in the 2000 federal election over Canadian Alliance candidate Gurdish Mangat and PC candidate Danny Varaich. He was re-elected again with a significant plurality over Conservative Raminder Singh Gill in the 2004 election, despite the fact that his riding was a key Conservative target. In the 2006 federal election, Malhi was elected over Conservative candidate John Sprovieri and NDP candidate Cesar Martello. Malhi was elected for the sixth time in the 2008 election over Conservative candidate Stella Ambler and NDP candidate Jash Puniya. In 2002, he became the recipient of the Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal for his commitment and contributions to Canadian society. In 2003, he was appointed for life to the Queen's Privy Council for Canada by Prime Minister Paul Martin. Gurbax Singh Malhi served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour from 2001 to 2003. From 2003 to 2004, Malhi served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry with special emphasis on Entrepreneurs and New Canadians. In 2004 he was named Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development and he served in this capacity until 2005. In 2005, Gurbax Singh Malhi also acted as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development and Minister responsible for Democratic Renewal. From 2005 to 2006, he also served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Revenue. In 2005, Malhi was among 32 Liberal Party backbenchers who voted against the Civil Marriage Act, despite the Liberal government being officially in favour of its adoption. In a House of Commons debate, he encouraged MPs to vote to maintain the definition of marriage as between one man and one woman \\"in keeping with the natural law and in conformity with God's design for the world\\" and downplayed discrimination against same-sex couples, stating that \\"just because differences exist in society, it does not mean that inequality and discrimination exist\\". In the 2011 federal election, the Liberal Party won the fewest seats in its history. Falling to third place, Malhi was defeated by Conservative Bal Gosal. Jagmeet Singh, the future leader of the NDP, finished in second. Like Malhi, Singh would be a trend-setter for Canadian Sikhs when he became the first turban- wearing, visible minority party leader in 2017. During the 2014 Ontario general election, he campaigned for his daughter Harinder Malhi, who contested and won the seat for Brampton‚ÄîSpringdale for the Ontario Liberal Party, becoming a Member of Provincial Parliament in the 41st Legislative Assembly of Ontario. == Electoral record == === Bramalea‚ÄîGore‚ÄîMalton === Source: Elections Canada Note: Conservative vote is compared to the total of the Canadian Alliance vote and Progressive Conservative vote in 2000 election. === Bramalea‚ÄîGore‚ÄîMalton‚ÄîSpringdale === Note: Canadian Alliance vote is compared to the Reform vote in 1997 election. === Bramalea‚ÄîGore‚ÄîMalton === Note that all electoral information is taken from Elections Canada. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1949 births Category:Canadian Sikhs Category:Indian emigrants to Canada Category:Liberal Party of Canada MPs Category:Living people Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Ontario Category:Members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada Category:People from Brampton Category:People from Punjab, India Category:Canadian politicians of Indian descent Category:Panjab University alumni Category:21st-century Canadian politicians ","title":"Gurbax Singh Malhi"},{"id":"1436223","text":"Real Radio was a network of five regional radio stations broadcasting to Northern England, Scotland, Wales and Yorkshire.

Ferr√©. It was formerly called Expreso Las Am√©ricas. It runs from PR-1 in southwest R√≠o Piedras and heads south until it intersects with highway PR-2 in Ponce. At its north end, the short PR-18 continues north from PR-52 towards San Juan. This short segment is known as Expreso Las Americas, the only segment of the route still unofficially bearing this name, since PR-18 is officially named Roberto S√°nchez Vilella Expressway. The combined route of PR-18 and PR-52 runs concurrent with the unsigned Interstate Highway PRI-1. Toll stations are located in San Juan, Caguas, Salinas, Juana D√≠az, and Ponce. ==Route description== Municipality of Ponce PR-52 is Puerto Rico's longest and second most traveled tollway. The road is mostly a 2-lane road in each direction. The section between the Caguas toll and the town of Salinas crosses the Cordillera Central, resulting in a more curvy and hilly section than the other sections of the highway. It also experiences more fog and lower visibility than the rest of the road due to the altitude. The speed limit is also reduced in the area. One of Puerto Rico's only 2 rest areas is located on this expressway. map The other rest area is located on PR-53 (northbound only) near Humacao/Naguabo municipality border although it is signed as a scenic zone and thus just like the rest area on PR-52, it has no facilities. map The rest area, however, has no relief, vending, or service facilities such as a restaurant or a gas station. The rest area does include an important monument, the Monumento al J√≠baro Puertorrique√±o. The whimsical Tetas de Cayey are visible from this rest area as well. PR-52 passes extremely close to the central town of Cidra between approximately kilometer markers 34 and 30. In fact, Exit 32 to Guavate is so close to the Cidra border that once the exit is taken and instead of going south to Guavate and Patillas through PR-184, going north it quickly ends at PR-1 and a welcome sign to Cidra is shown.

Construction for this road started in October 1968 during the administration of governor Roberto S√°nchez Vilella, also a trained engineer, and continued during Luis Ferre's tenure. It was then named Autopista Las Americas, and it was planned to run from San Juan to Ponce. On December 9, 1993, Law 118 was enacted which renamed the roadway Autopista Luis A. Ferre. The expressway is currently the longest in the island, but this will change when the 83-km-long PR-22 extends to Aguadilla. In March 1969 the roadway became a tolled expressway. The Puerto Rico Highway and Transportation Authority reports that tolls were added to the highway to speed up its construction.

The first issue of The Times printed with the new presses was published on 29 November 1814. In August 1817 Koenig returned to Germany because of a disagreement with Thomas Bensley, a London book printer partner, who Koenig believed sought sole rights to the new machine. After consideration he chose an abandoned monastery in W√ºrzburg for the premises of the factory.

Williams was convicted on May 1, 1981, for taking bribes in the Abscam sting operation,Williams is Guilty on All Nine Counts in ABSCAM Inquiry, New York Times, May 2, 1981 and resigned from the U.S. Senate in 1982 before a planned expulsion vote.Governing under the influence; Washington alcoholics: their aides protect them, the media shields them, Washington Monthly, June 1988. \\"Former senators who have acknowledged alcoholism included the chairman of the Agriculture Committee (Herman Talmadge); the chairman of the Finance Committee (Russell Long), who went on the wagon in the 1970s; and a senior liberal (Harrison Williams), who later went to prison after an Abscam sting caught him taking bribes. ==Biography== Williams was born in Plainfield, New Jersey, and graduated from Oberlin College in 1941. He engaged in newspaper work in Washington, D.C., and studied at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service of Georgetown University until called to active duty as a seaman in the United States Naval Reserve in 1941. He became a naval aviator and was discharged as a lieutenant, junior grade, in 1945. After being employed in the steel industry for a short time, he graduated from Columbia Law School in 1948, and was admitted to the bar and commenced practice in New Hampshire. He returned to Plainfield in 1949 and continued to practice law, and was an unsuccessful candidate for the New Jersey General Assembly in 1951 and for city councilman in 1952. ===Congressional service=== Williams was elected to the House of Representatives in a special election in 1953, and was re-elected in 1954 but defeated for re-election in 1956. He was elected to the Senate in 1958 and re-elected in 1964, 1970 and 1976, defeating a future leader in the Republican Party, David A. Norcross. He became the first Democratic senator in the history of New Jersey ever to be elected four times. Known as \\"Pete,\\" Williams fought for a range of social welfare laws and urban transit programs. He was instrumental in passage of such landmark laws as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which protects worker pensions, and the 1969 Coal Mine Safety and Health Act. He also helped pass legislation that created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and had a major role in passage of the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964, the first federal law to provide mass transportation assistance to states and cities. He also was the chairman of the United States Senate Special Committee on Aging from 1967 through 1971. Williams was the sponsor of the 1968 Williams Act (named after him), which regulates tender offers. ===Abscam conviction and resignation=== In 1981, Williams, a resident of Westfield, New Jersey, at the time, was convicted of bribery and conspiracy in the Abscam scandal for taking bribes in a sting operation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).Bachrach, Judy. \\"Facing Expulsion from the Senate He Loves, Harrison Williams Finds Some Unlikely Supporters\\", People (magazine), February 1, 1982.

Pete looked about 80 years old‚Äîhorrible.'\\" The Senate Committee on Ethics recommended that Williams be expelled because of his \\"ethically repugnant\\" conduct. Prior to a Senate vote on his expulsion, Williams resigned on March 11, 1982. Sentenced to three years, he served two years in Federal prison as Inmate #06089-050, the first time in over 80 years that a senator had spent time in prison. Williams was also charged a $50,000 fine in addition to prison time. Released on January 31, 1986, he served the remainder of his sentence at the Integrity House halfway house, where he later became a member of the board of directors until his death on November 17, 2001. He also attempted to receive a presidential pardon from President Bill Clinton, but his request was denied. The Metropark train station had been renamed Harrison A. Williams Metropark Station in 1979, in recognition of his support for its construction. However, the name was removed from the station after his conviction. Williams died of cancer and heart ailments at St. Clare's Hospital in Denville, New Jersey, on November 17, 2001.

That said, Mr. Justice Cattanach in Henderson Estate, Bank of New York v.

Bruce Mohs, the company founder, built limited- production automobiles on chassis built to custom specifications by the International Harvester Company. Automobiles by Mohs were built between 1967 and 1979. Mohs produced two models. Bruce Baldwin Mohs died February 1, 2015. ==Ostentatienne Opera Sedan== The Ostentatienne Opera Sedan was offered at a F.O.B. price of $19,600 (1967), had a weight of 5,740 lb (2,600 kg), and sat on a 119 in (3.02 m) wheelbase. Prices have also been quoted at $25,600. Tires for the vehicle were nitrogen filled 7.50‚Äùx20‚Äù (USA). The Ostentatienne was powered by an International Harvester truck engine. Entry into the car was from the rear; solid steel side rails (designed to protect passengers during a crash) prevented doors along the vehicle's sides. The Ostentatienne could be ordered customized to suit its buyer‚Äôs wishes; Ming styled oriental rugs, refrigerators and sealed beam taillights were some of the options available. Production was reported to be three to four vehicles per year, only one was ever built. The Opera Sedan was brought back to life in 2009 after sitting in storage for almost 20 years.

A personal friend of Mr. Mohs, Fred Beyer coordinated the restoration and displayed it at the 2009 Iola Car Show in Iola, WI. FHS students along with instructor Jay Abitz and associate Bob Abitz spent 16 weeks and over 400 hours repairing rust, fabricating panels, and restoring the paint and body. Retired teacher Fred Beyer and Mike Carnahan along with the \\"Hot Rod High Students performed all of the dis-assembly, mechanical repairs, detailing, and re-assembly.

Their hits include \\"Saturday\\" (not to be confused with \\"Saturday Night\\"; this was not released until two years after the album had come out), \\"Summer Jam\\" and \\"Tonight\\". The band has four members: Vic Krishna (vocals), Craig Smart (vocals), DJ Frank (remixes) and AJ Duncan (keyboards). == Career == The band was formed when Canadian artist Vic Krishna was visiting Germany and had a jam session with Canadian singer Craig Smart and the production team of ToneDef and Triple S. It went well, so they started recording; mostly demo tapes, but also full-fledged tracks. When there was enough material for an album, It Doesn't Matter was the end result. The group's most popular track, \\"Summer Jam\\", was one of the biggest pop hits in Europe. At one point, it was on the rotation list of every pop radio station in Germany. It also received much attention in the UK and US. \\"Summer Jam\\" reached a high of #2 on the German pop charts. MTV Germany and VIVA both supported the video, adding even more exposure. The biggest dance radio station in New York City, WKTU, also expressed support for the record and added it to their playlist, as well as market leader Power 96 in Miami. In addition to the original set of mixes, new mixes of the song have been completed by various remixers to enhance the record's appeal to a wider variety of club DJs. Most notable is the Dance Movement Extended Mix, done by Nitelite Record's Max Maroldo. The record became a Top 20 pop hit in Italy.

First delineated from aerial photographs taken by USN Operation Highjump in January 1947. Named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) after the ice-ship USS Bear, flagship of the USAS, from which three reconnaissance flights were made in late February 1940, resulting in the discovery of Walgreen Coast (with probable sighting of this feature) and the Thurston Island area. This ship, under the name Bear of Oakland, also served as flagship of the Byrd AE, 1933-35, which based at the Bay of Whales, Ross Ice Shelf. Launched in 1874 at Greenock, Scotland, for use in the sealing trade, she sank in 30-foot seas and high winds in the North Atlantic, March 19, 1963, at which time she was being towed from Nova Scotia to Philadelphia. == Geography == Bear Peninsula on the Walgreen Coast, lower centre of photo. Martin Peninsula is shown to the east, with the Dotson Ice Shelf between them. Bear Peninsula is large enough that numerous features along its coast and inland have been charted and individually named. Unless specified, the features noted below were first mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from air photos obtained by Operation Highjump in 1947 as well as surveys and U.S. Navy aerial photographs taken between 1959‚Äì66, and were named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN). === West coast === On the west side of the peninsula, the first notable named feature is Hunt Bluff, a steep rock and ice bluff approximately long. It was named after Lieutenant Robert B. Hunt, U.S. Navy Reserve, a medical officer with the Byrd Station winter party, 1966. north is a conspicuous rock bluff called Jeffery Head, named after Stuart S. Jeffery, a researcher in ionospheric physics at Byrd Station in 1966. north of that is Brush Glacier. Ber Peninsula's northernmost point is ice-covered Koloc Point, named after Lieutenant Commander Bohumil Koloc, Jr., a U.S. Navy helicopter pilot during Operation Deep Freeze 1966 and 1967. === East coast === The northeast portion of Bear Peninsula is called Gurnon Peninsula. Gurnon Peninsula is a completely ice-covered peninsula about long, between Park Glacier and Bunner Glacier. It was named after Lieutenant P.J. Gurnon, a Lockheed Hercules aircraft commander in Antarctica during Operation Deep Freeze 1965‚Äì67. Hummer Point is the eastern point of Gurnon Peninsula. It was named after Dr. Michael G. Hummer. South of Gurnon Peninsula on the east coast is Hamilton Ice Piedmont, an ice piedmont, wide, to the east of Wyatt Hill. Ice-covered Merrick Point sits on its east side. These features were named in 1977. The piedmont was named for Robert Hamilton, a meteorologist at the University of California, Davis, who was United States Antarctic Research Program Station Scientific Leader at South Pole Station, winter party 1975. The point was named for Dale Merrick of Stanford University, upper atmosphere researcher and Station Scientific Leader at Siple Station, winter party 1975. Continuing south on the east coast, the next notable feature is Grimes Ridge, a high, mostly ice-covered ridge at the north side of Holt Glacier. It was named after Captain E.W. Grimes, a member of the U.S. Army Aviation Detachment that provided Antarctic support during Operation Deep Freeze. Goepfert Bluff sits at its east end. It was named in 1977 after Lieutenant Eric R. Goepfert, U.S. Navy, officer in charge of the U.S. Naval Support Force, Antarctica, winter detachment at McMurdo Station, 1976. ==References== Category:Peninsulas of Ellsworth Land ","title":"Bear Peninsula"},{"id":"1436290","text":"Judicial notice is a rule in the law of evidence that allows a fact to be introduced into evidence if the truth of that fact is so notorious or well known, or so authoritatively attested, that it cannot reasonably be doubted. This is done upon the request of the party seeking to rely on the fact at issue. Facts and materials admitted under judicial notice are accepted without being formally introduced by a witness or other rule of evidence, and they are even admitted if one party wishes to plead evidence to the contrary. Judicial notice is frequently used for the simplest, most obvious common sense facts, such as which day of the week corresponded to a particular calendar date or the approximate time at sunset. However, it could even be used within one state to notice a law of another state‚Äîsuch as one which provides average baselines for motor vehicle stopping distances.Code of Virginia ¬ß 46.2-880 Tables of speed and stopping distances ==Judicial notice in the United States== ===Judicial notice in the Federal Rules of Evidence=== In the United States, Article II of the Federal Rules of Evidence (\\"FRE\\") addresses judicial notice in federal courts, and this article is widely copied by U.S. States. Article II of the FRE consists of a single rule, Rule 201. FRE 201 covers judicial notice of adjudicative facts, which are those concerning the parties to a proceeding, but not of legislative facts, which are general. FRE 201(b) permits judges to take judicial notice of two categories of facts: # Those that are \\"generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court\\" (e.g. locations of streets within the court's jurisdiction) or # Those that are \\"capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned\\" (e.g. the day of the week on a certain date). FRE 201(c) notes that judicial notice may be permissive or mandatory. Under the wording of the rule, judicial notice is permissive if the court takes such notice on its own but mandatory if a party requests it and the court is supplied with the necessary information. Courts have ruled that judicial notice must be taken of federal public laws and treaties, state public laws, and official regulations of both federal and local government agencies. A trial court's decision to take judicial notice or not to do so is reviewed on appeal under the standard of abuse of discretion.Judicial Notice on Appeal ===Judicial notice and the burden of proof=== FRE 201(f) establishes that the effect of the court taking judicial notice is different in civil and criminal trials. In a civil trial, the fact taken notice of is thereby conclusively proved. In a criminal case, the defendant has the right to contest every fact that might tend to incriminate him. Therefore, the court taking judicial notice would simply allow the jury to make the finding that the court took notice of, but would not require this outcome, and would not prevent the defense from presenting evidence to rebut the noticed fact. ===Judicial notice in foreign affairs=== Legal disputes about foreign affairs are generally settled by judicial notice by obtaining the information directly from the office of the Secretary of State (in the United States). For example, if a litigant in an extradition hearing attempted to argue that Israel was not a sovereign state, a statement from the Secretary of State that the U.S. recognized Israel as a sovereign state would settle the issue and no evidence could be led to the contrary. (In the United Kingdom, similar resourt could be had to information from the Foreign Secretary.) Recently, Court of Appeals decisions regarding the legal rights of detainees of Guantanamo Bay took judicial notice of Cuba having no sovereignty over the U.S. naval base in that location despite claims by the United States government that it was Cuban territory and not subject to the application of United States law. Federal courts and the courts of most jurisdictions have determined that matters of foreign law are subject to permissive judicial notice. ===Official notice=== During the prosecution phase of U.S. patent applications, a similar concept to judicial notice is applied by patent examiners, but the process is referred to as taking \\"official notice\\". In a typical patent claim rejection, the examiner has to present prima facie evidence from the prior art, usually patent documents or other printed publications, that the subject matter of a rejected claim was known or would have been obvious prior to the application for patent by the inventor. However, examiners may officially notice facts that \\"are capable of instant and unquestionable demonstration as being well-known\\". Patent applicants are then allowed to traverse the official notice given by an examiner, in which case the examiner must present an evidentiary document to prove the fact or limitation is well known.USPTO MPEP ¬ß 2144.03 ===Historical examples=== In the 1858 murder trial of William Armstrong, his attorney, then- former Congressman Abraham Lincoln, used judicial notice to establish that a claim by a witness to have used moonlight to see events could not have taken place since there was no visible moon that evening. This led to Armstrong's acquittal.Death of William Armstrong: Was once held for murder and Abraham Lincoln defended him. The New York Times, May 14, 1899. In the 1934 United States Supreme Court case Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes took judicial notice of the economic conditions of the Great Depression to help conclude that a state of emergency existed, and thus the State of Minnesota could properly impose on the contracts made by private persons to promote a broad societal interest. Specifically, the Court upheld a Minnesota statute preventing loan companies from foreclosing on homes before 1935, despite mortgage agreements allowing companies the right to do so.Home Loan Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398 (1934) In the 1981 case of Mel Mermelstein v. Institute for Historical Review, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County took judicial notice of the fact that \\"Jews were gassed to death at the Auschwitz Concentration Camp in Poland during the summer of 1944.\\" ==Judicial notice in Australia== In New South Wales, judicial notice may be taken of facts that are \\"not reasonably open to question\\".Uniform Evidence Act, s 144(1) This may include, for example, the location of well-known geographical features. However, both parties must be given notice of the judicial officer's intention to rely upon the information.Farkas v R [2014] NSWCCA 141 ==Judicial notice in Canada== Besides the categories of judicially noticed facts found in other common law jurisdictions, the Supreme Court of Canada has required Canadian courts to take judicial notice of such facts as the history of colonialism in Canada and its harmful effects on Indigenous peoples: :To be clear, courts must take judicial notice of such matters as the history of colonialism, displacement, and residential schools and how that history continues to translate into lower educational attainment, lower incomes, higher unemployment, higher rates of substance abuse and suicide, and of course higher levels of incarceration for Aboriginal peoples. ::‚ÄîR. v. Ipeelee, at para. 60R. v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13 (CanLII), [2012] 1 SCR 433 (LeBel, J.) Some judges have taken a similar approach to the history of racism against other ethnic groups in Canada, such as African Canadians, concerning whom Justice Nakatsuru of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice wrote: :I find that for African Canadians, the time has come where I as a sentencing judge must take judicial notice of such matters as the history of colonialism (in Canada and elsewhere), slavery, policies and practices of segregation, intergenerational trauma, and racism both overt and systemic as they relate to African Canadians and how that has translated into socio-economic ills and higher levels of incarceration. ::‚ÄîR. v. Jackson, at para. 82R. v. Jackson, 2018 ONSC 2527 (CanLII) (Nakatsuru J.) However, some other judges have declined to follow this approach.R. v.

Norville is the anchor of Inside Edition, a syndicated television news magazine, a position she has held since March 6, 1995. She is a member of the board of directors of ViacomCBS. She markets and sells a line of yarns (Deborah Norville Collection) for knit and crochet enthusiasts, manufactured by Premier Yarns. Previously, she was an anchor and correspondent for CBS News and earlier co-host of Today on NBC. Her book Thank You Power was a New York Times best-seller. ==Early life== Norville was born in Dalton, Georgia. She won her town‚Äôs local Junior Miss contest, a beauty contest for high school senior girls and represented Georgia in the 1976 America‚Äôs Junior Miss pageant. She did not win but credits seeing the behind- the-scenes work of the CBS Television production team as inspiring her to switch her career goal from law to television journalism. She hosted the 1999 America's Junior Miss contest. ===Education=== Norville is a graduate of the University of Georgia. She graduated summa cum laude in three years with a perfect 4.0 grade point average in earning her BA in journalism from the university‚Äôs Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication. She was named a First Honor Graduate and elected to Phi Beta Kappa. During her studies, she served on the Main Court of the University‚Äôs Student Judiciary and was a member of Delta Delta Delta sorority. ===Early career=== Norville began her television career while still a college student. She received an internship through Georgia Public Television, where she worked on The Lawmakers, a nightly program covering the Georgia General Assembly. She was spotted by an executive of WAGA-TV in Atlanta, who offered her a summer internship. As Norville recalled, \\"The third day they were short on reporters and they asked me to cover a news story.\\" She reported that evening on the six o‚Äôclock news and was later offered a weekend reporting position during her senior year in college. The 60-mile commute between school in Athens and work in Atlanta was grueling, as remembered by Norville in an interview with Larry B. Dendy for the Georgia Alumni Record (February 1990): \\"I'd leave the university on Friday afternoon and drive to Atlanta, and sometimes I had a place to stay and sometimes I slept in my car in the parking lot. I worked Saturday and Sunday; Sunday night after the 11:00 p.m. show I'd drive back and go to class Monday morning.\\"\\"Norville, Deborah.\\" Current Biography Yearbook 1990. The H.W. Wilson Company. 1990. p. 481. In January 1979, she conducted a live interview with President Jimmy Carter. Norville joined WAGA-TV as a full-time reporter after graduating and was named weekend anchor in October 1979. In 1982 she was hired as a reporter and later an anchor by WMAQ-TV, the NBC-owned station in Chicago. In 1986, when it was announced Norville would be joining NBC News in New York, Mayor Harold Washington declared \\"Deborah Norville Week\\" in Chicago. ==NBC News== Norville joined NBC News in January 1987 as anchor of NBC News at Sunrise, becoming the only solo female anchor of a network newscast. Ratings on Sunrise jumped 40 percent when she joined the program, which led to her being asked to occasionally substitute on NBC‚Äôs Today Show. In August 1989, a documentary in which Norville was the primary host, Bad Girls, on violent teenaged girls, was the seventh most watched show the week it aired, according to Nielsen ratings. In September 1989 Norville was named news anchor on Today. Soon after, Today co-host Jane Pauley announced her desire to leave the Today Show, and Norville was named her successor. Pauley went on to host a prime- time show, Real Life with Jane Pauley. Norville became co-host of Today in January 1990. During her tenure on Today, she won an Emmy award for her role in NBC‚Äôs coverage of the democratic uprising in Romania. Ratings on Today declined after Norville‚Äôs arrival. NBC management was accused of mishandling the transition. One insider told People magazine, ‚ÄúNBC handled the whole situation in a very poor manner. I don‚Äôt think she [Deborah] blames anyone in particular. I just think she feels the situation was handled unprofessionally‚Äîin an undignified manner for both her and Jane.‚Äù After Norville took maternity leave on the birth of her first child, she did not return to the program. ==ABC Network Radio== In May 1991, ABC TalkRadio Networks announced Deborah Norville would be hosting a prime-time program, broadcast from her homes in New York and Long Island. The Deborah Norville Show: From Her Home to Yours featured newsmaker interviews and listener calls. It ran from September 1991 to October 1992, when Norville joined CBS News to resume her television career. ==Return to television== Norville returned to television in October 1992, when she joined CBS News as a correspondent. She reported for Street Stories and 48 Hours, for which she won her second Emmy award for coverage of the Mississippi floods of 1994. She was later assigned to the CBS Evening News and named co-anchor with Dana King of America Tonight. From 1993 to 1995, Norville was a semiregular anchor of the CBS Sunday Evening News, which had been vacant since Connie Chung was elevated to co-anchor of the CBS Evening News. In 1995, Norville was named anchor of Inside Edition, a syndicated newsmagazine, a position she continues to hold. In March 2015, the show celebrated her 20th anniversary on the program, noting that she had become the longest-serving female anchor on national television. Among Norville‚Äôs reports were her dispatches from the Davidson County, North Carolina, jail, billed as the ‚Äútoughest in America‚Äù; her interview with Paula Jones, whose accusation of sexual harassment by then-president Bill Clinton led to the Monica Lewinsky scandal and impeachment proceedings, and her series of ‚Äújobs,‚Äù notably the song she wrote and performed, ‚ÄúKeep On Movin.‚Äù Set to music written by noted producer Junior Vasquez, Norville wrote the lyrics, a challenge she described in O, The Oprah Magazine. ‚ÄúThe strength from meeting that challenge,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúis still with me. It‚Äôs the boost you get from accomplishing something you never dreamed you could do.‚Äù In 2003, MSNBC announced Deborah Norville was joining its prime-time lineup to host a 9:00 p.m. program. She left Deborah Norville Tonight in 2005, citing the challenge of juggling her Inside Edition and MSNBC duties along with family responsibilities. In 2015, Knit and Crochet Now!, a craft show seen on public television, announced the appointment of Norville as host of its upcoming season. ==Publishing== Alongside her television career, Norville has frequently moonlighted as a writer. She served as a contributing editor to Inside Sports magazine in the 1980s and as a contributing editor to McCall‚Äôs magazine from 1991 to 1993. She published the New York Times best-seller Thank You Power: Making the Science of Gratitude Work for You (Thomas Nelson, 2007), featuring the benefits found by research on gratitude. This was preceded by Back on Track: How To Straighten Out Your Life When It Throws You a Curve (Simon and Schuster, 1997), which drew on her earlier experiences on the Today Show. The Power of Respect: Benefit from the Most Forgotten Element of Success (Thomas Nelson, 2009) explains‚Äîthrough scientific evidence‚Äîhow respect is power in business, at home, and in your personal life. Her history of Inside Edition, The Way We Are: Heroes, Scoundrels, and Oddballs from 25 Years of Inside Edition, written with Charlie Carillo and with a foreword by Donald Trump (Inside Edition Books, 2013), details all 8,150 episodes of the show, celebrating its 25th anniversary. Additionally, she has written several knit and crochet pattern books, most notably Knit With Deborah Norville‚Äî18 Classic Designs For The Whole Family (Leisure Arts, Inc., 2009). She has also written two children‚Äôs books‚ÄîI Don't Want to Sleep Tonight (Golden Books, 1999) and I Can Fly (Golden Books, 2001)‚Äîand contributed to several editions of the Chicken Soup for the Soul series. ==Other activities== In 2008, Norville began performing in infomercials. In addition to commercials for anti-aging creams and lotions, she launched the Deborah Norville Collection of knit and crochet yarns in partnership with Premier Yarns, a North Carolina-based yarn manufacturer. Norville debuted the line at the 2009 Craft Hobby Show, the craft industry‚Äôs premier convention, where she also served as the keynote speaker. Norville stated in a Swedish interview that since the early 1980s, she has been an active supporter of commercial whaling activities as they supply raw materials for her anti-aging and lotion products. She continues this effort through financial support of the Japan Whaling Organization, a pro-whaling group. The Norville line of yarns and other knit and crochet accessories are available in retail craft stores and online. Deborah Norville was elected to the board of directors of ViacomCBS in March 2013. She serves on the company‚Äôs compensation committee. ==Personal life== Norville married Swedish businessman Karl Wellner in 1987; the couple has three children, Niki (b. 1991), Kyle (b. 1995), and Mikaela (b. 1998). On April 1, 2019, Norville announced that she would be undergoing surgery to remove a cancerous thyroid nodule. The cancer was detected after a viewer noticed a lump on Norville's neck. ==See also== *New Yorkers in journalism ==ReferencesCategory:American television news anchors Category:American television reporters and correspondents Category:American television talk show hosts Category:American women television journalists Category:Living people Category:MSNBC people Category:NBC News people Category:People from Dalton, Georgia Category:People from the Upper East Side Category:Television anchors from Chicago Category:University of Georgia alumni Category:1958 births Category:20th-century American journalists Category:21st-century American journalists ","title":"Deborah Norville"},{"id":"1436317","text":"A DNA construct is an artificially constructed segment of nucleic acid that is to be transplanted into a target tissue or cell.

According to the 2001 Ukrainian census, it has a population of 11,124. Current population: Khotyn, first chronicled in 1001, is located on the right (southwestern) bank of the Dniester River, and is part of the historical region Bessarabia. Important architectural landmarks within the city include the Khotyn Fortress, constructed in the 13-15th centuries (new fortress started in 1325, major improvements in the 1380s and 1460s), and two 15th century constructions by Moldavia's ruler Stephen the Great: the Prince's Palace (Palatul Domnesc) and the city's clock tower. Historically, the town was part of the Principality of Moldavia (1359-1432, 1459-1538, 1541-1562, 1572-1615, 1621-1673, 1699-1712), the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (1432-1459, 1538-1541, 1562-1572, 1615-1620, 1673-1699) and the Ottoman Empire (1711-1812) . Subsequently, it was part of the Bessarabia Governorate of the Russian Empire (1812‚Äì1917), Moldavian Democratic Republic (1917‚Äì1918), Romania (1918‚Äì1940, 1941‚Äì1944), the USSR (1940‚Äì1941, 1944‚Äì1991) and Ukraine (1991 - ). ==Name== Khotyn (; ; ; ; ) was conquered and controlled by many different states, resulting in many name changes. Other name variations include Chotyn, or Choczim (especially in Polish). ==History== ===Early history: 11th‚Äì15th centuries=== Khotyn, located on cliffs above the Dniester, is sometimes conflated with a sound-alike locality mentioned in 1001, a minor settlement of Kievan Rus'. Archaeological excavations found that the Kievan town covered the area of some twenty hectares. It later became part of the Principality of Halych and its successor, Halych-Volhynia. The town was an important trading center due to its location by a river crossing. A Genoese trading colony was established there by the 13th century. Khotyn was first mentioned in 1310, as a residence of a catholic bishop, being held in the first half of the 14th century by the Kingdom of Poland, which intended to impose Catholicism on the local Vlach communities, mentioned there in the 10th-13th centuries. The first fortifications date back from this period. In 1351, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania conquered the area, only to give it three years later to the Vlachs, who formed their own independent principality in 1359, Moldavia. The present- day fortress was constructed after 1400 by the Moldavian ruler Alexander the Good, with the help of Vytautas the Great of Lithuania. After 1433, it was occupied by Poland, due to wars between Alexander's successors, and was reconquered from the Poles by Stephen the Great of Moldovia in 1459 after a two-year siege. The fortress, strengthened by Stephen, during the 15th century, became the strongest on the northern border of the medieval Moldavia. === Conquest by different states === The Khotyn Fortress, located on the shores of the Dniester River. The Khotyn Fortress During Wallachian ruler Michael the Brave's conquest of Moldavia in May 1600, its ruler Ieremia MovilƒÉ took refuge in the Fortress of Khotyn together with his family, a handful of faithful boyars, and the former Transylvanian Prince, Sigismund Bathory. As the Moldavian state's international significance was dwarfed by that of the Kingdom of Poland and the Ottoman Empire, the latter sought to gain control of the strategic river crossing. As a result, Khotyn's later history was dominated by wars between the expanding Christian powers (first Poland, then Russia) and the expanding Ottoman Empire. The Turks suffered two decisive defeats at Khotyn in the 17th century, at the hands of the army of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth: in 1621 by Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, and again in 1673 by Jan III Sobieski (see: Battles below). The Ottoman Empire finally seized the fortress from Moldavia in 1713 during the Great Northern War and held it during the following century as a base for its troops. Another power, Russian Empire, came to claim the region in the 18th century. The Turks amplified and enlarged the citadel, which was besieged and taken by the Russians on four occasions: in 1739 by Burkhard Christoph von Munnich, in 1769 by Prince Alexander Galitzine, in 1788 by Prince Josias of Coburg, and Ivan Saltykov, in 1807 by Ivan Ivanovich Michelson. With the start of the Russo- Turkish War in 1806, the Khotyn Fortress was taken by the Imperial Russian Army and passed to Russia. With the signing of the Bucharest Peace Treaty in 1812, the entire region that became known as Bessarabia was annexed by the Russian Empire from Moldavia. From 1812 to 1918, Khotin was the administrative center of the Hotin County, one of the twelve, later nine counties of Bessarabia. During the 19th century, due to economic reasons and the geographic proximity of Kamianets-Podilskyi (an important political center during the late Middle Ages and the early modern times), the Ukrainian population of Bessarabia (especially in its north) increased significantly, from around 15,000 in 1810 to around 200,000 in 1917 (of which over half in the northern half of the Hotin county alone), mostly by migration from Podolia (just across the river Dniester). During World War I, the north-eastern corner of the Hotin county was the only area of Bessarabia occupied temporarily by Austria‚ÄìHungary. ===Modern history: 20th-21st centuries=== A street in Khotyn Khotyn theatre With the collapse of the Russian Empire, Bessarabia proclaimed independence from Russia in 1917, then union with Romania in April 1918. Romania and Austria signed a Peace treaty in May 1918, and the Austrians withdrew. The treaty was not formally ratified by Romania, a former Entente ally which found itself in isolation, until on November 10 Romania re-entered the war. The Austrians were in control of Khotin and several villages around for several months starting February 28, 1918.,http://www.russianwarrior.com/STMMain.htm?1914_History_1917.htm&1 until Romania took over, due to the fact that on April 9, Bessarabia declared union with Romania. Shortly after that, in January 1919, local Ukrainians desiring to be part of Ukraine, started a revolt,Oleksandr Derhachov (editor), \\"Ukrainian Statehood in the Twentieth Century: Historical and Political Analysis\\", Chapter: \\"Ukraine in Romanian concepts of the foreign policy\\", 1996, Kiev Ihor Burkut, Khotyn uprising against Greater Romania, \\"Chas \\", January 1, 2003For the discussion whether the uprising was a Russian Bolshevik coup, see the Khotin Uprising article. which was also exploited by some Soviet agitators, followed by the ethnic cleansing of Ukrainian civilians by Romanian authorities, on January 23‚ÄìFebruary 1, 1919. After the Khotin Uprising was put down by the Romanian Army, Romania implemented nationalist policies aimed at re-Romanizing the territory.Dovidnyk z istori√Ø Ukra√Øny, 3-Volumes, Article \\"Hotyns'ke Povstannya, 1919\\" (T.3), Kiev, 1993‚Äì1999, (t. 1), (t. 2), (t. 3). As of this time, the population was approximately 35,000. The city remained under Romanian control until 28 June 1940, when along with Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina it was occupied by the Soviet Union. In August 1940, Soviets created the Chernivtsi Oblast, and included the area around Khotin to it, which became part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, not of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, as the rest of Bessarabia. After Operation Barbarossa, where Romania acted as a Germany ally, the area was retaken by Romania in early July 1941. In March 1944, with the defeat of the Axis forces, the town was retaken by the Soviets, and reattached to the Soviet Ukraine. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine in 1991, Khotyn became a part of newly independent Ukraine. In 2000, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine created the historical- architectural preserve \\"Khotynska Fortetsia\\" (Khotyn Fortress). In September 2002, the city celebrated its 1,000 year anniversary. ==Battles== Defending the Polish banner at Chocim painted by Juliusz Kossak Jan Karol Chodkiewicz (in red) at Chocim In the first Battle of Khotyn in 1621, an army led by Osman II, advanced from Adrianople towards the Polish frontier. The Turks, following their victory in the Battle of Cecora, had high hopes of conquering Polish controlled Ukraine. The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth commander Jan Karol Chodkiewicz crossed the Dniester in September 1621 with approximately 35,000 soldiersChekhovsky, p. 252 and entrenched the Khotyn Fortress, blocking the path of the Ottoman march. The arrival of 40,000 Ukrainian Cossack forces under their hetman Petro Konashevych was helpful in that anti-Ottoman victory. The Commonwealth hetman held the sultan at bay for a whole month, until the first snow of autumn compelled Osman to withdraw his diminished forces. But the victory was also dearly purchased by Poland: a few days before the siege was raised, the aged grand hetman died of exhaustion in the fortress on September 24, 1621. The Commonwealth forces held under the command of Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski. The battle, described by Wac≈Çaw Potocki in his most famous work Transakcja wojny chocimskiej, marked the end of the long period of Moldavian Magnate Wars. In 1673, the Polish hussars again fought a major battle on this site (second Battle of Khotyn). This time Polish forces under the command of soon-to-be-king Jan Sobieski defeated the Ottomans on November 11, 1673. In this battle, rockets of Kazimierz Siemienowicz were successfully used. This brilliant victory was a prelude to the Battle of Vienna 1683. In the Russo-Turkish War, the fortress was taken by Russian field marshal Burkhard Christoph von Munnich on August 19, 1739. This victory is remembered primarily through the Ode on the Taking of Khotin from the Turks, composed by the young Mikhail Lomonosov. This ode has a place in the history of Russian literature: its sonorous iambic verse is often taken as a starting point of the modern Russian poetry. ==Natives== * The Romanian philologist, historian and writer Bogdan Petriceicu-Hasdeu was born near Khotyn on February 16, 1836. * Azriel Yanover (1875‚Äì1938), a Yiddish poet, playwright, and educator; lived in Khotyn from 1895. * Alemdar Mustafa Pasha (1765‚Äì1808), Ottoman Grand Vizier, was born in Khotyn ==Jewish cemetery== Khotyn contains a Jewish cemetery, indexed by the U.S. Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad. ==Religious building== A church built in the fortress grounds was later converted to a mosque by the Turks. ==Footnotes and references== ==External links== * Flags of the World ‚Äì Khotyn (Chernivtsi, Ukraine) * Khotyn photo gallery ‚Äì by Sergiy Klymenko, July 2004 * Castles and churches of Ukraine ‚Äì Khotyn, Chocim Category:Cities in Chernivtsi Oblast Category:Cities of district significance in Ukraine Category:Populated places on the Dniester River in Ukraine Category:Populated places in Bessarabia Category:History of Bessarabia Category:Populated places established in the 11th century Category:Khotinsky Uyezd Category:Hotin County Category:Capitals of the counties of Bessarabia Category:»öinutul Suceava Category:Shtetls ","title":"Khotyn"},{"id":"1436326","text":"Mount Kaplan is a massive mountain, the highest in the Hughes Range of Antarctica, standing 5 km (3 mi) southeast of Mount Wexler.

The character was created by Bruce Timm and Paul Dini and first appeared in the pilot episode of the animated television series Batman Beyond (1999‚Äì2001), voiced by Will Friedle. Terry McGinnis is the vigilante known as Batman in the future, having taken over the mantle after the aging Bruce Wayne went into retirement. In the DC animated universe continuity, he eventually learns that he is the biological son of Bruce Wayne (under a covert genetic engineering by Project Cadmus) unbeknownst to him and Bruce at first being that the former was conceived and raised by Warren McGinnis. ==Publication history== McGinnis was created for the Batman Beyond animated television series, as a continuation of The New Batman Adventures, originally meant as a character for the DCAU. For a long time, he was not considered a character for the main DC Universe. Countdown introduced Earth-12, an alternate universe with its own version of Terry McGinnis and other Beyond-like characters. Superman Batman (comic book) #22 (2005, which predates Superman Batman Annual 4) was the first comic to depict McGinnis as existing in the future of Batman and the characters of the mainstream comic book DCU. In Batman # 700, Terry's mentor is not Bruce, but Damian Wayne, who had become the third Batman after Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson (in other words Terry would be the fourth Batman). The 2010 story Superman Batman Annual #4 returned to the DCAU Terry's story, as later did a 2011 Batman Beyond miniseries. From 2012, DC began publishing three Terry-related comic books: Batman Beyond and Justice League Beyond most prominently, though the character also appears in Superman Beyond. Terry officially entered mainstream DC continuity in the 2014 New 52 maxiseries, The New 52: Futures End. It has since then produced two separate comic book series, the first in 2015 where Tim Drake has replaced Terry as Batman, and the second one in 2016 which is part of DC Rebirth where Terry has become Batman once again. ==Fictional character biography== ===Batman Beyond=== Terry was born in Gotham City to Warren and Mary McGinnis, a research scientist at Wayne-Powers and an astronomer at Astro-Tech respectively on August 18, 2023. By his own admission, he was once a \\"bad kid\\". As a former member of a street gang run by youthful racketeer Charlie \\"Big Time\\" Bigelow, Terry had his fair share of run-ins with the Gotham City Police at age fourteen while his parents were going through a divorce, even serving a three-month stint in juvenile hall (having been underage, he is spared Charlie's three-year sentence where Charlie was old enough to be tried as an adult). A 16-year-old Terry McGinnis; from the animated series Batman Beyond. Twenty years after Batman is last seen, Terry finds himself on the run from the Jokerz, another street gang, who have modeled themselves after the long-dead Gotham City legendary criminal, the Joker. Terry flees onto the grounds of Wayne Manor, where an aged Bruce Wayne comes to his defense. The strain of the fight places substantial stress on Bruce's weak heart, so Terry helps Bruce into the mansion and gets him his medication; Bruce proceeds to fall asleep afterward. Before leaving, Terry notices a bat stuck inside a grandfather clock. As he tries to free it, he stumbles upon the entrance to the Batcave and realizes that the elder man was the city's heroic Dark Knight. He is then forced to leave by an enraged Bruce. Terry returns home to find his father murdered, ostensibly by Jokerz. He later discovers that Derek Powers (who has assumed leadership of a merged Wayne-Powers) ordered Warren's death after the latter discovered Powers' plan to mass-produce biological weapons. Powers' right-hand man Mr. Fixx leads a raid on the McGinnis home and shoots Warren McGinnis. (In the comic books, he orders one of his henchmen, who is a great grand-nephew of Joe Chill, to shoot Warren). Terry then seeks Bruce's assistance in bringing Powers down but cannot convince the old man to inflict swift justice - Bruce is still shaken from an ordeal 20 years earlier of having relied on a handgun for self-defense (the event that forced him to retire as Batman for good) as well as the events of Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker. Bruce suggests that Terry take the evidence against Powers to the current commissioner of police but, after a scuffle with Powers during which Derek is able to reclaim the evidence, Terry takes matters into his own hands and steals the latest incarnation of the Batsuit. Despite some initial mistrust, their similar backgrounds convince Bruce to aid Terry. Terry successfully derails Powers' plan, exposing Powers to his own viral weapons in the process, resulting in his mutation into Blight. Convinced that there is still a need for a Batman, Bruce hires Terry as his \\"personal assistant\\" and begins secretly training him for his new role as Gotham's Dark Knight. In addition, Bruce assists Terry in the field primarily by keeping in continual contact with him from the Batcave. Beyond the vigilante duties as Batman, Terry is also Bruce's chauffeur and provides assistance with Bruce's daily business and personal tasks at his home and office, which also allows him to bond with Bruce's dog Ace when he helps him care for the Great Dane. In time, the pair develops a bond of trust and respect, and confide in each other not only just their mutual missions, but also life issues as well, similar to a father and son. Bruce would even trust Terry over Barbara Gordon's words when the villain Spellbinder frames Terry for murder with another one of his illusions. After Powers' criminal identity is revealed to the public and he finally brings retribution to his father's killer, Terry decides to continue his role as Batman to make up for his past sins, in the hope that it is his chance at redemption. Later in his career as Batman, he has a confrontation with an elderly Amanda Waller, who reveals that she engineered his origin to create a replacement Batman for Bruce Wayne. McGinnis learns that Wayne is his biological father; Waller used nanotechnology to ensure that Bruce Wayne's DNA overwrote the DNA in Warren McGinnis's reproductive cells. She had intended to take things one step forward and recreate the tragic circumstances that drove Bruce into becoming the Batman (by hiring The Phantasm to murder the young boy's parents in front of him), but her hired assassin refused at the last minute. In conclusion, Waller tells Terry that while he does not possess Bruce's level of deduction and analytical skills, he does possess the same heart. ===Project Batman Beyond=== In the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Epilogue\\", which takes place 15 years after Batman Beyond, Terry discovers the shocking truth about his paternity. When Bruce requires tissue for the cloning of a kidney to transplant, Terry is checked for compatibility. To his surprise, his DNA is almost identical to Bruce's. After hesitating for a time, he runs a DNA test and finds out that Bruce is his biological father. Terry tracks down Amanda Waller, the only person in the world he believes can answer his questions. As he does so, he imagines scenarios where he leaves the people important to himself because he believes his life was a lie. Terry vents some of his frustration about Bruce and his plans to Waller, only to be surprised when Waller reveals that it was not Bruce who was responsible for Terry's genetic makeup - it was her, without Bruce's consent or even knowledge. Decades earlier, Waller was the government liaison to the Justice League and she slowly began to realize and believe that Batman was the most capable person in the League; despite not having any powers, his willpower, body strength, and acute intelligence made him the most balanced and reliable fighter in the entire League. Because of this, Waller slowly began to respect and trust Bruce Wayne. However, Waller noticed something as the years went by: Batman was human. As such, he was getting older and more and more unable to handle the day-to-day intensities as a crimefighting superhero. She knew that one day Batman would have to retire, or there would be the chance that he'd be killed by one of his enemies eventually. Fearing that fact and believing the world always needed Batman, she decided to create a new one. Waller, with old connections to Project Cadmus, gathered the technology necessary for her movement, codenamed \\"Project Batman Beyond.\\" Bruce Wayne's DNA was obtained from a mission where he got injured - a small blood sample on a piece of gauze left at the scene of the mission. Years later in Neo Gotham, she found a couple that was psychologically identical to Bruce's parents. Warren McGinnis was called in to get a routine flu shot that was actually a Project Cadmus nanotech solution that was used to reconstruct the DNA within his reproductive system to match Bruce Wayne's. A short while later - approximately one year - Mary McGinnis gave birth to Terry, who was a combination of her and Bruce. Waller executed the final phase of her plan when Terry was eight years old. She hired an assassin - Andrea Beaumont, Bruce Wayne's former fianc√©e and the enigmatic Phantasm - to kill Terry's parents so that the trauma of seeing his parents murdered in front of him would cause Terry to someday become Batman. However, Beaumont got cold feet at the last minute and realized that to commit murder in Batman's name would dishonor his legacy. Waller, realizing that Beaumont was right, cancelled the project, resulting in Matt, Terry's brother, being born later. Nevertheless, eight years later, Terry's father was murdered and the young teen encountered Bruce, sealing Terry's fate. Waller's admission of guilt and affirmation of Terry's destiny allowed Terry to overcome his anger and bitterness. Terry then decided to propose to longtime girlfriend Dana. According to episode co-writer Dwayne McDuffie, Bruce, as a master detective, becomes aware that Terry and Matt are his genetic offspring at some point after Terry assumes the role of Batman, and figures out the machinations of Waller and Project Cadmus; however, he never brings it up out of respect for Warren McGinnis, and because he wants Terry to be his own man. He also comes to love Terry and Matt as his sons. This project was used in the Batman Beyond original comic book miniseries, with the Beyond version of Hush being a twisted clone of Dick Grayson created after the original Dick was badly injured in a fight; Waller had reasoned that a clone of Grayson would be easier to control than one of Bruce, but the new Grayson went insane, killing most of Batman's survived-but-retired villains and nearly triggering a new earthquake before he was defeated by McGinnis, the original Grayson, and the new Catwoman. ===DC Main Universe=== The Batman Beyond concept became DC Comics canon in the pages of Superman/Batman issues 22 and 23, wherein Bizarro is transported to an alternate reality somewhere in Hypertime which resembled the Batman Beyond-era Gotham City, with Batman Beyond in action with the 1999 animated black-and-red costume and the 1992 Batplane from the original animated series. This version of the character is in radio contact with Bruce Wayne, but was referred to as \\"Tim\\". The Batman Beyond cameo was enough to garner a DC Direct action figure, the character's first in years, listed as \\"Tim Drake\\". Also, in Countdown to Final Crisis, former Robin Jason Todd, former Wonder Girl Donna Troy, Green Lantern Kyle Rayner, and Bob the Monitor travel to \\"Earth-12,\\" which resembles the DCAU's future. They witness from the rooftops someone in a Batman Beyond costume defeating members of the Jokerz gang (although they do not know who is under the mask of the future Batman), to which Jason Todd says: \\"Huh. The more things change, the more they stay the same.\\" The group speculates that either Tim Drake or Dick Grayson is under the mask. However, The Monitor confirms it is indeed McGinnis.Countdown to Final Crisis #21 Dan DiDio announced in a July 2009 questions segment with Newsarama that Terry McGinnis would be appearing within DC Comics again in the future. The Batman Beyond miniseries began its run on 16 June 2010, set in 2039 Neo- Gotham, revolving around the assassination of anyone who had anything to do with Bruce Wayne's Batman, foe or friend. Dan DiDio stated that this \\"Terry McGinnis mini-series\\" is in response to the interest expressed by the \\"fans of the character.\\" It will be penned by Adam Beechen, a non-DCAU Batman television writer. According to Beechen, the comic book arc will open the door for the \\"legendary\\" DCAU to enter into the mainstream DC Universe (comics), tying into both continuities. The series will take place after McGinnis had defeated the reborn Joker and pick up where Bruce Timm initially left off, but years before he learns that Bruce Wayne is his biological father. In 2010, Terry appeared alongside Superman in the oversized issue Superman/Batman Annual 2010, where it picks up after their first meeting together taking place in the DCAU, and also jibing with the DCU. Terry became officially part of the DCU canon in Superman/Batman Annual #4. In \\"The New 52\\" reboot following the 2011 Flashpoint comic book crossover, Terry made his debut in DC Comics' latest continuity in 2014. On October 6, 2010, it was announced at New York Comic-Con that Batman Beyond would start as an ongoing series in January 2011. The series ended with only eight issues in August. However, a new series titled Batman Beyond Unlimited will serve as a return to the Beyond universe. The title will feature Superman Beyond, Justice League Beyond and Batman Beyond starring McGinnis. Terry McGinnis officially entered mainstream DC continuity in the 2014 New 52 maxiseries, The New 52: Futures End. ==Relationships== ===Bruce Wayne=== Despite his role as the second Batman, Terry leads a very different, far less privileged life than Bruce. In addition to coping with his father's death, Terry struggles to keep his double life secret from his mother and younger brother. Because of his responsibilities as Batman and personal assistant to Bruce, he is not afforded the same licenses the Robins enjoyed and is expected to be on the call whenever he is needed. As a result, Terry is just barely successful at balancing out his dual life, on several occasions prompting both men to reconsider Terry's reliability. This is evidenced by him perpetually sleepy during the day, struggling to stay awake for school or to have time for his family and girlfriend. Terry and Bruce develop an unspoken respect for each other, with Terry regarding Bruce as a surrogate father, not knowing his biological connection to Bruce at first. This is demonstrated in the episode \\"Sneak Peek\\" where Terry pays reporter Ian Peek a visit to plead on Bruce's behalf: :Terry: \\"I don't care what you do to me, but he doesn't deserve this. He's done too much for this city to wind up in the middle of a media circus.\\" :Peek: \\"He means a lot to you, doesn't he?\\" :Terry: \\"Yes... he does.\\" Even though the stern attitude of Bruce with Terry is meant to ensure that he pushes Terry both emotionally and physically, and even though Bruce can at times be very emotionally distant to the young Batman, there are occasions where he also shows genuine concern and love for Terry. In one instance he defended Terry to Commissioner Barbara Gordon when Shriek held Gotham hostage in exchange for Batman's life: :Bruce: \\"What are you saying Barbara? That I should just hand Terry over to Shriek?\\" :Barbara: \\"No, give him to me. I'll figure out something. I had some pretty good teachers, remember?\\" :Bruce: \\"I remember, but you work for a mayor who would sell out the kid at the drop of a hat.\\" :Barbara: \\"Look, if you've got a better plan...\\" :Bruce: \\"All I know right now is this: That kid's done a lot for this city, it's time the city did something for him.\\" In turn, Bruce initially treats Terry the same way he treated Dick Grayson and Tim Drake. In time, Terry grows into the cowl, and Bruce grows to accept him as his heir to the Batman legacy, demonstrating a great deal of faith in him despite his criminal past; in the episode \\"Eyewitness,\\" when Terry was framed by Spellbinder for murder, Bruce trusted Terry's claims of innocence even after Barbara Gordon told Bruce that she had seen Terry kill a man. Over time, the generally private Bruce Wayne even told Terry about some of his old enemies and adventures as Batman, such as his old relationship with Selina Kyle, with Terry also doing his own independent research into individuals such as Talia al Ghul, although Bruce rarely discussed the Joker due to the intensely personal nature of his confrontations with the villain. The Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Epilogue\\" reveals that Terry is secretly Bruce's biological youngest son (since Damian, who was conceived via Bruce's tryst with Talia) due to Amanda Waller's \\"Batman Beyond\\" project. The project caused Warren McGinnis to have his DNA re-written into an exact copy of Bruce's when he had what he thought was a flu shot; this would make Bruce the biological father of Terry and his younger brother Matt McGinnis, even though they were born to Warren and Mary McGinnis. When Terry was eight years old, the same age Bruce lost his parents, Waller then hired assassin Andrea Beaumont, AKA: The Phantasm, Bruce Wayne's former fianc√©e, to kill Warren and Mary as they were coming out of a movie theater with their son, hoping to recreate the same psychological trauma that resulted in Bruce becoming Batman within Terry, but at the last minute Beaumont abandoned the job, believing it would go against everything Bruce stood for: this would eventually lead Waller to completely abort the project - however, Warren's death at the hands of a criminal ironically cemented Terry's destiny as the next Batman. This twist seems to be foreshadowed in a number of Batman Beyond episodes, as references to Bruce being a father figure are occasionally made, both by Terry and other characters, as well as the similarities the two men share. Both of Terry's parents are shown as having red hair in Batman Beyond, which is usually a recessive trait, which would make it extremely unusual for them to have biological sons with black hair. Additionally, at the end of the episode \\"The Call\\", Superman implied he knew of Terry's true lineage. ===Family members=== Terry values his mother, Mary McGinnis, and his younger brother, Matt, as the closest family he has left. At the time of his death, Warren McGinnis was divorced from his wife and their sons split between them; Terry with his father, Matt with his mother. After the divorce, Terry's relationship with his father is shown in the episode \\"Rebirth\\" to be strained. The last time they spoke Terry and his father have a heated argument, something Terry is never completely able to forgive himself for (even after finding out that Warren was not his real father). Like Thomas Wayne, Warren's death inspired Terry to fight crime as Batman. After Warren's death, Terry moves back in with his mother and brother. Even though there exists an obligatory spark of sibling rivalry and tough love between himself and Matt, Terry would be there to raise his brother's spirits when he was feeling down, notably in the episode \\"Revenant\\" when Matt reminisces about their father. Matt is also an obsessive Batman fan, which is ironic considering that he never realizes his brother and the hero he idolizes are one and the same, and oblivious of his biological relation to the original Dark Knight. As far as Mary and Matt are concerned, Terry is simply employed by Bruce Wayne to run errands during the series, finding the idea of Terry being Batman to be absurd, ridiculing him when he once attempts to reveal his secret in the episode \\"Sneak Peek\\". In the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Epilogue\\", Terry tells Bruce Wayne that he never once doubted that Warren McGinnis loved him with all his heart, and would have taught Terry right from wrong if the young man had been willing to listen. In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Matt McGinnis is aware of his brother's secret identity after Terry revealed it to him when he rescued Matt from a crumbling bridge. He becomes more active in assisting both Tim and Terry when they take on the mantle of Batman, and possibly hopes to inherit the mantle himself one day. However, in Rebirth, Matt became the new Robin instead. Their mother is also deceased as a result of Futures End.Batman Beyond (vol. 6) #1 (October 2016) ===Friends and colleagues=== ====Max Gibson==== Maxine \\"Max\\" Gibson, a classmate of Terry's and later one of his closest friends, is an African American girl with short dyed pink hair who attends Hamilton Hill High School with Terry. Her parents are separated, and she has one older sister who often works late hours. Max is exceptionally intelligent and talented with computer programming, even among her peers. It is revealed in the episode \\"Babel\\" that the Gibsons own a seal- pointed Siamese cat. Max becomes curious about Batman after his \\"return\\" to Gotham City. Exceptionally skilled with computers and electronics, she creates a program that is designed to uncover Batman's secret identity to satisfy that curiosity. After unmasking Terry (following an incorrect assessment of him being a Jokerz hooligan), Max insists on being a part of his secret life and helps him with everything from computer hacking to coming up with excuses to give his girlfriend Dana. She even expressed a desire to want to be the next Batgirl at some point, but both Bruce and Terry refused to allow that possibility to become a real one. Max's importance is similar to that of Barbara Gordon's in the comics, as the resident hacking genius. Terry and Max remain close, but their relationship is never shown to exceed the boundaries of friendship, which is in contrast to the relationship between Barbara and Bruce, who were briefly involved. Max is, essentially, Terry's version of Alfred Pennyworth; Terry even jokingly referred to her as such on one occasion. The show has been revisited several times since its end, in Justice League Unlimited, Static Shock and in the movie Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, but Max has not been seen or mentioned in any of these. However, she has made an appearance in the fourth issue of the ongoing comic book series Batman Beyond and presently of the first issue of the current Batman Beyond series that was released as part of DC Rebirth, which is part of a separate continuity that is part of the New 52 universe. Notable episodes In the episode \\"Hidden Agenda\\", Max reveals that she is writing a computer program to analyze all the data available on Batman and deduce his secret identity. She informs her friends Terry McGinnis and Dana Tan that she believes that Batman is a new person in the old suit, and is somehow connected to their school. This concerns Terry, who is in fact the new Batman. When the school is vandalized by a gang of Jokerz, Max reconfigures her program to search for Jokerz instead. Unknown to her, the vandalism was targeted at her personally: the leader of the Jokerz, Terminal, is actually an honor student named Carter Wilson, and Max's standing is higher than his, outperforming him academically; at the current rate, she will be valedictorian instead of him. Terry, as Batman, discovers that Max is a specific target and mistakenly believes that it is because of her computer program. He convinces her to stop running the program, but when Max goes to delete it, she learns that it has completed its analysis. Much to her surprise, Terry's name comes up on the list of potential Jokerz, and she becomes convinced that Terry is Terminal and sends him a message, threatening to expose his secret if he does not meet her. Further confusing the issue, Terry does not get the message until late, and Terminal (who was following her) shows up at the meeting place with his Jokerz. Terry arrives as Batman and rescues Max, revealing Terminal's true identity in the process. Max later admits to Terry that she had thought he was one of the Jokerz, but has now figured out the truth. She goes to delete her program, but Terry advises her that it has already been wiped after Bruce hacked into the school's computer systems. Max then immediately proves herself an asset by providing an alibi for why Terry did not call Dana the previous night when he was saving Max. Max tells Terry that he cannot call her Robin; he instead jokingly calls her \\"Alfred\\". (Naturally, she fails to understand the reference, given Alfred's lack of exposure in Batman's exploits to the public). In the episode \\"Hooked Up\\", Max attempts to join Terry on patrol as his partner, even though both he and Bruce do not approve. Trying to prove her worth to Terry, she becomes addicted to Spellbinder's illegal VR technology, but fights off its influence and knocks Spellbinder out before he can injure Terry. Although Terry remains unwilling to allow her to physically assist him, he accepts her as his partner after she helps him defeat Curar√© and disarming Mutro Botha's nuclear weapon in the episode \\"Final Cut\\". Terry initially hides Bruce's identity from Max, but Max already has enough information to deduce that Terry's employer is actually the original Batman. In \\"Where's Terry?\\", when Terry goes missing in Gotham's maze of subway tunnels, Bruce and Max look for him together and manage to come to an understanding regarding their respective importance to Terry, although Bruce steadfastly refuses to allow her to become involved in rescuing Terry. In times, Bruce and Max eventually become friends. ====Dana Tan==== Terry flirted with several girls throughout the show, but his main love interest has always been Dana Tan, his long-time girlfriend. In the episode \\"Big Time,\\" she recognizes Charlie \\"Big Time\\" Bigelow by sight, suggesting that Dana and Terry knew each other since their early teens, although in \\"Rebirth\\", Terry's mother notes that Dana, Terry's \\"friend\\", left him her number, suggesting that they became an item over the course of the series. Despite their commitment to each other, their relationship is strained as Terry struggles early on as Batman to balance his dual obligations. The two have been on the verge of breaking up several times, especially before Terry meets Melanie Walker, AKA Ten of the Royal Flush Gang, but despite being close to breaking up several times over, Dana somehow manages to forgive Terry for his absences, believing that Terry sees Bruce Wayne as a father-figure and doesn't want to fail him. The two are usually shown together many times through the series, including the motion-picture movie Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker. However, as the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Epilogue\\" reveals, Terry ultimately grows into full acceptance of his role as Batman, and somewhere along the line discloses his secret to Dana. Despite knowing his secret, Dana shows to have accepted his double life and is willing to be with him, even if her safety is threatened. She is also frustrated with the fact that they have been dating for years and have not married. Although it takes him some time to get over his fears for her safety in the event that his identity is ever compromised, the episode ends with Terry planning to propose to her. In the comics, it was revealed that Dana had a brother named Doug who led an assault on Gotham as the leader of the Jokerz. Dana requests Terry and Bruce's help in finding him, but Doug manages to kill thousands of people by sending a large group of Jokerz as suicide bombers around the city. Doug confronts Dana and her family in the hospital (after he fractured their father's skull), but before Doug can kill them, Bruce manages to call Batman in to save the Tans, eventually resulting in Doug's death. Batman's rescue led Dana to figure out that Terry was Batman and what his connection to Bruce was. Bruce and Terry trusted Dana enough to keep the secret, and Dana's family agrees to implant Bruce with Doug's liver to save Bruce from dying of liver failure. ====Melanie Walker/Ten==== In the midst of a spat with Dana, Terry meets Melanie Walker and the two become extremely attracted to one another instantly; however, Terry is crushed when he learns she too leads a double life: as Ten, the youngest member of the latest incarnation of the Royal Flush Gang. He discards a note Melanie had left him without reading it, choosing to be with Dana instead in his anger due to the betrayal, leaving Melanie apparently oblivious that her enemy and her lover are the same person. Terry has additional encounters with Ten and the Royal Flush Gang; each time, he advises her to turn straight, showing that he still cares deeply about her. Their relationship is somewhat reminiscent of the one the original Batman had with Catwoman, and Bruce even notes it. Melanie is later shown to have gone straight and has abandoned the life of a criminal for a normal one. In a comic book series based from the continuity of the animated series, Melanie is now enrolled in Terry and Dana's college, continuing the love triangle between them. After Batman and Ten stop Inque and Queen from stealing Two-Face's coin, Terry accuses Melanie of stealing the coin, leading the two to break up as Melanie accepts that she can never get Terry to trust her again no matter what she does. ====Commissioner Barbara Gordon==== Terry upholds tradition by forging an alliance with Gotham City's police commissioner, Barbara Gordon, formerly Batgirl/Oracle and the daughter of James Gordon. The alliance starts out on a sour note, as Barbara never fails to take Terry's juvenile record into account and believes he is too reckless for the role of Batman. The fact that Terry occasionally ruins police stakeout operations by intervening without fully assessing the situation sometimes worsens their relationship. In addition to this, Barbara, actually the last of the Bat-Family to retire from vigilantism, revealed she and Bruce were romantically involved at one point, but his unwavering focus on his mission strained their relationship, thus having a new Batman appears to have opened up old wounds for her. Barbara is reluctant to assist the new Batman and to have a teenager as Gotham's new protector. The direct-to-video movie Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker revealed that Barbara remains haunted by the torture that Tim Drake long ago suffered at the hands of the Joker. She advises Terry to give up being Batman, and once tries to arrest him after he is framed for murder by Spellbinder; however, when the truth comes out, Barbara rewards Terry with a civic service award as an apology. Barbara eventually relents, however, upon realizing that she could not deter him any more than she could have been deterred from being Batgirl. Barbara eventually warms up to Terry, assisting him when Bruce is put out of action by a revived Joker. She states that she hopes Terry would avoid the lonely existence that Bruce leads. However, Barbara's attitude is different from Jim Gordon's, and she notes once that she is \\"not [her] father\\", never working as closely with Terry as her father did with Bruce (i.e. using a Bat-Signal, directly giving him leads, etc.). In the comics, Barbara works closer with Terry than in the animated series and gives him the necessary information about the criminals they face. She even gives him the opportunity to take the villains down before calling in for police support. She becomes more involved when Terry starts working with her former lover, Dick Grayson. At one point, she and Dick tell Terry that her relationship with Bruce went to shambles because Barbara was seeing both at the same time, while keeping her affair with Bruce secret from Dick. Eventually, this reached the breaking point when Barbara became pregnant from Bruce, who then decided to tell Dick without gaining her consent. Because Barbara would not relent from crimefighting, she suffered a miscarriage, all of which resulted in the bitter end of her participation as a member of the Bat-Family.Batman Beyond 2.0 #27 (August 2014) In 2011's New 52 reboot of the series, Barbara is slightly younger than she was in the animated series (still retaining her red hair) and isn't hesitant to work with Terry likely due to the extreme circumstances the world was put in thanks to Futures End. When Terry was presumed dead and Tim Drake was Batman, her role as the tech expert was similar to Bruce's role to Terry's Batman. ====Dick Grayson==== Though Terry never met Batman's former sidekick that was Robin and Nightwing in the animated series, the two did get the chance to meet in the tie-in comic. They work together to bring down Hush (who was a failed clone of Grayson), and Dick helped Terry with handling the Jokerz bombing Gotham and Undercloud. Though Dick was uninvolved in the superhero community for quite some time after losing his eye during a fight between Batman and the Joker, Terry has inspired him to return to the spotlight. When a GCPD detective outs Dick as Nightwing to the public, Terry and Max try to make the public think otherwise by having Terry interrogate the detective as a disguised, older Nightwing while Max plants alibis on the internet. Dick admits the truth to the public without jeopardizing his allies' secrets. After learning how Bruce impacted Dick and Barbara's romance, Terry loses trust in Bruce and chooses Dick to be his new mentor. Terry finds working with Dick easier than Bruce, Dick reminds Terry of his commitment to his family and to his education. Terry also managed to convince the Justice Lord counterpart of Dick to aid him in battling Lord Superman. After Lord Superman is defeated, Dick and Terry's counterpart are inspired by Terry to continue Bruce's legacy and begin their version of Batman Beyond. Dick becomes T's mentor for fighting criminals. ====T==== T is Terry's counterpart in the Justice Lords timeline. In this timeline, Terry became estranged from his parents (his father is alive in this reality), dyed his hair blond, and became a member of the Jokerz. He was also dating the Justice Lord counterpart of Melanie, who was also part of the Jokerz. When Terry arrives in his reality in the Justice Lords Beyond story arc, he is disgusted by T's personality and actions as a Joker. He's also upset that T is distant from his parents and doesn't take advantage of his dad being alive in this reality. In the event, Terry's near-sacrifice at the hands of Lord Superman and courage convince T to turn his life around. T and this reality's Dick Grayson assist Terry in escaping and taking on Lord Superman. When Lord Superman is defeated, T gives Terry the chance to talk to his father in return for his actions. T and Dick are inspired by Terry to continue Batman's legacy and he becomes this reality's version of Batman Beyond. Following this, Terry makes frequent visits to the timeline to monitor T's journey as a hero and becomes increasingly impressed with T's progress. He also takes the time to make visits with T's dad. However, when Rewire blackmails Batman into giving him access to the Justice Lords timeline, Bruce destroys the portal. T and the alternate Dick make one last visit over where T tells Terry that he told his father about his situation and that he wants to see both of them. However, Terry's accepted that T's father will never be his and decides not to go back to their timeline again. He tells T to spend time with his loved ones before they are gone and gives one last goodbye before T and Dick return to their timeline. ====Charlie Bigelow==== Charlie \\"Big Time\\" Bigelow is a con artist who dragged Terry into a life of crime. In the episode \\"Big Time,\\" Terry reveals his background with Charlie to Max, explaining that the same felony which landed him in juvie for three months had Charlie put away for three years. Guilt-ridden, Terry would e-mail Charlie periodically while he was in prison. When Charlie is finally released, Terry convinces Bruce to give him a job at Wayne-Powers. This turns out to be a ploy by Charlie to aid in a corporate espionage scheme, during which Charlie is exposed to an experimental growth compound and mutated into a monstrous, disproportionate creature. Despite Terry's friendship with Bigelow and the regret that his time in jail did not reform him, subsequent events in the episode \\"Betrayal\\" make clear that Bigelow saw Terry merely as hired muscle. Terry finally lets go of his guilt toward Charlie and sees him for the monster he really is. Terry and Charlie's friendship is reminiscent of Bruce and Harvey Dent, two best friends who eventually become enemies, another similarity that Bruce notes. ===With other superheroes=== Terry grew up admiring other superheroes of his day, the Justice League Unlimited. Eventually, he is recruited by Superman to root out a traitor in the team, which turns out to be Superman himself, under the control of the extraterrestrial creature Starro. Though the rest of the team at first distrusts him due to his perceived inexperience, Terry gains their trust by saving their lives and freeing Superman from the alien's mind control. However, he says that he would prefer to be like his mentor and only partially serve on the Justice League. When Static is sent 40 years into the future from the time of the Static Shock series, he is forced to work with Terry to rescue Static's future self from the KOBRA organization. While Terry doubts his abilities at first, he eventually develops respect for Static. Terry also sees the resemblance in both the teenage and adult version. Terry seems to have rejoined, as later episodes of Justice League Unlimited show him as a regular member (and possibly leader). In the alternate timeline shown in the JLU episode \\"The Once and Future Thing, Part 2: Time Warped,\\" Terry fights alongside Static (of that era) and Warhawk. He is killed in the episode, though his death is undone thanks to time travel. ==Powers, abilities, and equipment== Even prior to receiving training from Bruce, Terry appeared to be at least a well abled street fighter. In the pilot episode \\"Rebirth\\", he is able to fend off a number of Jokerz without aid, and appears to be a member of his high school's wrestling team. As expected of Batman, he engages in regular, rigorous training to minimize his reliance on the Batsuit: under Bruce's tutelage, Terry has honed his body to at least Olympic levels. Terry has engaged in combat outside of the Batsuit in various instances. His training has granted him exceptional reflexes, enabling him to evade gunfire and make impressive leaping attempts whether in or out of the Batsuit. In one instance, without the suit's aid, Terry survives a fall from several stories high by bouncing off a pillar that is about to crush him and lands on his feet. Terry even defeats his suit in single combat when it is controlled by the computerized consciousness of a deceased business mogul, armed only with the equipment in Bruce's vintage utility belt. Fifteen years after the last episode of Batman Beyond, as Terry reaches his thirties, he is able to get through Amanda Waller's security systems and overpower her guards without the aid of his suit, suggesting that his skills are rivaling his mentor's when he was in his prime. In \\"Epilogue\\", Waller comments that Terry has inherited several of Bruce's qualities: he possesses a high intellect (though Waller notes that Bruce is still the brighter of the pair) and has grown into Bruce's physical stature and build, having been significantly leaner than Bruce was as Batman during the series. Terry tends to rely on Bruce for the intellectual details when in the field, but he has received an amount of detective training from Bruce, allowing him to perform such feats as tracking down Shriek or determining a connection between Joker and Tim Drake when Bruce was incapacitated. Despite his detective training, Terry's ambition is to be a physician, and, under Bruce, he learns to create cures, remedies and antidotes. As a student, his main interests are in health or medical sciences and history; however, his responsibilities as Batman and less-than-stellar study habits have caused problems with his grades, as seen in \\"The Eggbaby\\" where he needed to get a good grade on a Family Studies practical assignment in order to pass the class. As Batman, Terry emulates Bruce's deep, harsh tone. He does this of his own accord, to separate the entities of Terry and Batman (Terry can be heard using his \\"Batman voice\\" outside of the Batsuit in the episodes \\"Shriek\\" and \\"Future Shock\\"). Actor Will Friedle has stated that he believes Terry's \\"Batman voice\\" is not just to strike terror into the hearts of criminals, but also to conceal his adolescence. Terry has a tendency to taunt his opponents: on one occasion, he was able to put the revived Joker off-balance to the point of blind anger. Terry is also capable of using a rather convincing Brooklyn accent when undercover (\\"Shriek,\\" \\"Ace in the Hole\\"). Terry is a skilled motorcyclist, seen hijacking a Jokerz motorcycle in \\"Rebirth\\" and using it throughout the series, and has also demonstrated considerable skill in handling a flight-capable Batmobile. ===Terry's Batsuit=== Terry's Batsuit. The Batsuit worn by Terry is the last incarnation created by Bruce before his retirement. Though the technology in the suit is at least 20 years old, it is still considered cutting-edge. In addition, after Terry becomes Batman, it is implied that the suit is updated numerous times, and after it is destroyed, he and Wayne are seen rebuilding and modifying it. The cowl in this suit covers the face completely, with the mouth being the only opening. The traditional cape has been eliminated in favour of retractable glider wings under the arms. Thrusters built into the boots allow flight in the absence of wind, although for prolonged long-range flight Terry typically uses the Batmobile. In case the suit is stolen, the circuitry in the suit can be paralyzed remotely from the Batcave. This Batsuit conforms to the size and physique of its wearer, being able to fit both the physically imposing Bruce and the significantly slimmer Terry. The form-fitting material provides almost no reduction in flexibility, while muscular enhancement technology enhances the wearer's strength and also grants the wearer agility and endurance. The material in the suit is resistant to massive concussive forces (in particular, it was able to take blows from Superman), fire, lasers, electric shocks, water pressure, wind force, bullets and even low levels of radiation. After an episode where Terry nearly drowns, a built-in rebreather is added to allow the user to remain underwater for long periods or breathe in other inhospitable areas. The suit possesses a two-way audio-visual link with the Batcomputer, allowing Terry to keep in contact with Bruce for superior tactical planning. The same applies to the Batmobile, which will automatically fly to the user's location when summoned. Directional microphones in the fingertips allow the user to hear and record audio through walls or at a distance - this data can then be transferred to a separate microchip as evidence. Lenses in the cowl's eyepieces transmit visual data to the wearer, allow for various scanning abilities and allow Wayne to monitor Terry's activities from the Batcave, seeing and hearing what he sees and hears and advising him. The cowl's lenses can also scan a number of frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum allowing night vision among other things. However, as the suit's visual capabilities are entirely electronic, the user is effectively rendered blind if they are disrupted. The suit has several defensive capabilities. A device on the belt can electrically charge the suit to repel close attackers, added after Terry's encounters with the shapeshifting supervillain Inque; this same feature can be limited to just the hands, turning the defensive technology into an offensive one if need be. The suit (and the Batmobile) also possesses a cloaking device that can render Terry invisible to the naked eye - although it cannot, however, filter ultraviolet light. Pads on the feet can be magnetically charged, allowing the user to cling to metal surfaces even when upside-down, mimicking bats' hangings. The suit's offensive capabilities are also significant. It carries a large number of dispensable Batarangs which, when inactive, are compact enough to be invisible to the naked eye. These Batarangs come with a range of auxiliary functions, such as producing electric shocks or explosions. The Batarangs are usually thrown by hand, but can be fired from a wrist-mounted launcher (which also fires its own \\"Dark Knight Discuses\\" in the game). However, there is a limit to the amount of Batarangs the Batsuit can dispense; Batman has run out on at least one occasion. Spare Batarangs still kept in the utility belt along with other arsenals. It is integrated into the suit and carries tracers, flash and smoke pellets, extinguisher capsules, flexicuffs and a detachable buzz saw on the buckle. Retractable claws on the fingers can be used to cut through objects and grip solid surfaces and the forearms are equipped with grappling hooks that can act as bolas. Finally, the Batsuit possesses a number of other devices to aid in detective work. The right index finger possesses a retractable decoding device for electronic locks, the palms possess polygraph sensors, and the fingers can analyze most substances they are dipped into. Other, less-used devices, such as frequency scanners, also make appearances. ===Prototype Batsuit=== In the later comics, when Terry's suit was heavily damaged Bruce gave him a spare prototype Batsuit to join the Justice League on a mission. The most notable feature was a cape, and while the suit gave him identical physical abilities, its sensors and communication capabilities were less advanced. ===Lord Batman's Synthetic Kryptonite Batsuit=== While on a mission into the parallel universe where the Justice Lords reside, Terry found an alternate version of his Batsuit (hidden in the compartment where Bruce kept the prototype suit) built by Lord Batman before his death to counter Lord Superman's powers and abilities, the extra enhancements included force fields, holographic projections, and it featured synthetic kryptonite as a weapon. After defeating Lord Superman, he and Dick Grayson started upgrading his own suit with the enhancements. The upgrades include a new pair of wings on Terry's Batsuit to help him gain better capability in flight, but Bruce rejects the new wings. ===The Bat Armor=== Seen only twice in the series, the Bat Armor is donned by Bruce in an encounter with Inque, who had kidnapped Terry and was holding him hostage. It is a retractable powered exoskeleton composed of heavy plate armor that enhances the survivability of the wearer, boosting their physical strength and resilience to superhuman levels greater than that of the Batsuit. When retracted, Bruce was able to wear a trench coat over it and not look like he had any considerable increase in body mass, although activating the armor shredded the trench coat in the process. Bruce created the Bat Armor years earlier in light of his increasing heart problems as a possible replacement for the Batsuit; however, during testing, using the armor nearly gave him a heart attack and he was forced to abandon that option. Understandably, Bruce only uses the Bat Armor in dire circumstances. This armor is featured in the episode \\"Disappearing Inque\\". ==In other media== Terry and Bizarro. ===DCAU tie-in comics=== In addition to having his own ongoing comic book, the Tomorrow Knight made an appearance in Superman Adventures #64, chasing a futuristic version of Brainiac. ===Television=== *McGinnis has made a guest appearance on the Batman Beyond spin-off series The Zeta Project. He also appeared on Static Shock in the episode \\"Future Shock,\\" which involved time travel and a future Static. McGinnis later appears in three episodes of Justice League Unlimited; \\"The Once and Future Thing, Part 1: Weird Western Tales\\" (at the very end), \\"The Once and Future Thing, Part 2: Time Warped,\\" alongside Static and Warhawk. (He is apparently killed in the episode by Dee Dee using their energy whips, though his death is undone later, as the episode's plot involved time travel.) After the timeline is fixed and Terry's death is prevented, Terry is seen 15 years older in the JLU episode \\"Epilogue,\\" which is centered on him and takes place in his timeline, serving as the series finale to Batman Beyond. *McGinnis made his return to television since \\"Epilogue\\" to the DC Nation Shorts adaptation of Batman Beyond during the 75th-anniversary celebration for Batman. *A wallpaper of McGinnis as Batman is shown in Nightwing's house in the animated series, Teen Titans Go!, although he makes no physical appearance. ===Video games=== *Terry's advanced outfit has been featured as downloadable or pre-order bonus content in Batman: Arkham City and in Batman: Arkham Knight as a secondary variant outfit. It's also available in Injustice: Gods Among Us. The costume is also available for avatar use on Xbox Live. *Terry McGinnis appears via downloadable content as a playable character in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, voiced by Troy Baker. *Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker for Game Boy Color, PlayStation and Nintendo 64 followed the movie of the same name. ==See also== * Batman Beyond * Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker * Batman Beyond (comics) ==References== ==External links== * DK Publishing.

Agrarian Democrats hoped to keep more money in circulation in order to keep interest rates lower. In summary, wealthy eastern delegates demanded a plank promising that federal war bonds be redeemed in gold-even though many of the bonds had been purchased with badly depreciated paper greenbacks. Poorer Midwestern delegates answered with the \\"Ohio Idea,\\" which called for redemption in greenbacks. Debt-burdened agrarian Democrats hoped to keep more money in circulation and keep interest rates lower. This dispute later showed a bitter fight over the money policy that would fight the Republic and cause disagreement until the century's end.(This is almost a quote from \\"The American Pageant - A History of the American People\\", 14th edition, Kennedy, Cohen, & Bailey, p. 437) Category:Political history of the United States ","title":"Ohio idea"},{"id":"1436349","text":"Sigma Alpha (Œ£Œë) is a professional agricultural sorority. ==History== On January 26, 1978, five students, Ann Huling Mathews, Cindie Davis, Marilyn Burns, Jennifer McMillan and Amy Mathews, founded Sigma Alpha at the Ohio State University.

Santiago first rose to prominence as one half of the East Coast hip hop duo Capone-N-Noreaga (C-N-N), alongside fellow Queens-based rapper Capone. He would also have success as a solo artist with the singles \\"Superthug\\", \\"Banned from T.V.\\", \\"Nothin'\\", \\"Oye Mi Canto\\" and \\"Mas Maiz\\". Santiago has released music under various record labels, including Penalty, Roc-La-Familia, Def Jam, and Babygrande Records. In June 2011, it was announced Santiago partnered with fellow American rapper Busta Rhymes' Conglomerate label, where he released his 2013 album Student of the Game, issued under E1 Music. Santiago is also chief executive officer (CEO) of his own imprint, Militainment Business. ==Musical career== ===1995‚Äì1997: Career beginnings with Capone=== Santiago's career began to take off in 1995, while under the pseudonym Noreaga (after Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega), as part of the duo Capone-N-Noreaga (C-N-N), alongside friend and fellow Queens-based rapper Capone (whom he met while serving time in prison). They signed to Penalty Recordings in 1996, and released their debut album The War Report, in 1997. The War Report was a commercial and critical success that made the duo well known among hip hop audiences. The album received praise for using the \\"traditional grimey boom- bap\\" sound of classic New York City hip hop, which at that time was falling out in favor of a more futuristic sound. The album peaked at #21 on the Billboard 200, and the singles \\"Illegal Life\\", \\"Closer\\", and \\"T.O.N.Y. (Top of New York)\\" all charted on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles and Tracks chart. ===1997‚Äì2000: Solo career and debut album=== Following the release of the album, Capone was again sentenced to a jail term, which left Noreaga to take on a solo career and make an album on his own. Noreaga's solo debut studio album N.O.R.E, was released in 1998. The title, a shortening of the artist's name, used the backronym \\"Niggaz on (the) Run Eatin'\\". The album became even more successful than the duo's debut, charting at #3 on the Billboard 200 and being certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album features guest appearances from fellow NYC rappers Nas, Kool G Rap, Big Pun and Busta Rhymes. It also features in many cases a different production style than The War Report, including the modern futuristic sound, with tracks produced by then-up-and-coming producers The Neptunes and Swizz Beatz. The Neptunes produced the hit \\"Superthug\\", which reached #36 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. The song, along with Mase's hit \\"Lookin' At Me\\", was one of the Neptunes' first high-profile productions and made them one of the most sought after production teams in hip hop. It also started their relationship with Noreaga as they would continue to produce more hits for him in the future. In 1999, Noreaga would go on to release his second solo album, Melvin Flynt - Da Hustler, which was a moderate success, reaching the top 10 of the Billboard 200 and becoming certified gold by the RIAA. The album's most successful single (produced by The Neptunes) was \\"Oh No\\", which reached #49 on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles and Tracks chart. Capone was released from prison in 1999. The two subsequently began recording music together again and released their second C-N-N album in the year 2000. The album, titled The Reunion, was not well-received critically and failed to match the commercial success of the duo's debut or Noreaga's solo albums. AllMusic reviewer Matt Conaway summed up the album by stating \\"With The Reunion, Capone-N-Noreaga take a step backward.\\" The group would then go on a hiatus and not release another album until 2009. ===2001‚Äì2007: Name change and reggaeton era=== Noreaga continued to pursue his career as a solo artist. He officially changed his stage name to N.O.R.E., and after some delays, his third solo studio album God's Favorite, was released in 2002. The album peaked at #3 on the Billboard 200 and was later certified platinum. It contained the major hit \\"Nothin'\\" (produced by The Neptunes), which reached #10 on the Billboard Hot 100. It became N.O.R.E.'s highest-charting hit. Following God's Favorite, N.O.R.E. changed his musical focus. He began recording Spanish- language songs to reflect his Puerto Rican background and made reggaeton music, rather than traditional hip hop. The reggaeton single \\"Oye Mi Canto\\", was released in 2004 and became a major hit, peaking at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was originally supposed to be a single from an upcoming album titled 1 Fan a Day, but the album was never released. Instead, N.O.R.E. released a reggaeton/hip hop album in 2006, titled N.O.R.E. y la Familia...Ya T√∫ Sabe, which included the lead singles \\"Oye Mi Canto\\" and \\"Mas Maiz\\". The album, released under Jay-Z's Roc-La-Familia, has both English and Spanish language tracks. It did not chart nearly as well as any of N.O.R.E.'s previous solo albums, as it only reached #82 on the Billboard 200. He also is a playable character in Def Jam Vendetta and Def Jam Fight for New York N.O.R.E. went on to release two more solo albums. The first, his fifth album Noreality, was released in 2007 and supported by the single \\"Set It Off\\", featuring vocals and production from Swizz Beatz. N.O.R.E. released his CD/DVD, Noreality, in September via a joint venture with his own Thugged Out Militainment label and Babygrande Records. The album features guest appearances from Jadakiss, Three 6 Mafia, Kanye West, Pharrell, Mobb Deep's Prodigy, Bun B, Tru Life, David Banner, Kurupt and Capone. Swizz Beatz is among the producers. The DVD, which was available in limited quantities, is based on the rapper's life. The second album S.O.R.E., was controversially released in 2009. N.O.R.E. would go on to denounce S.O.R.E., calling it an album he had nothing to do with and asked fans not to purchase it. The album is a reference to his stage name and his first album which is a backronym for \\"Niggaz on (the) Run Eatin'\\", which makes \\"S.O.R.E.\\", \\"Still on (the) Run Eatin'\\". The term was first used in late 2007, when N.O.R.E. released a song entitled \\"Still on the Run Eatin'\\", featuring Lil Wayne. N.O.R.E. said in a video blog that he didn't approve of this album. He also stated the album's artwork was of him at 310 pounds, adding he had lost 62 pounds since then. He also went on to mention five songs on the album were actually handed in, while the rest were pulled off the internet, some of which came from 2007, probably stemming from label financial issues. He later stated the official album he's working on is N.O.R.E. Pt. 2: Born Again. ===2009‚Äìpresent: Student of the Game === In 2009, N.O.R.E. collaborated with Capone once again, to release their third studio album Channel 10, which charted at #136 on the Billboard 200. In 2010, a fourth Capone-N-Noreaga album titled The War Report 2, was released. Its lead single was \\"Hood Pride\\", featuring Faith Evans. In June 2011, fellow American rapper Busta Rhymes, with whom N.O.R.E. has collaborated several times in the past, stated on his Twitter account that he had officially signed N.O.R.E. to his newly founded record label Conglomerate Records. Between 2009 and 2011, N.O.R.E. teamed up with DJ EFN to host a satellite radio show for Sirius XM called Militainment Crazy Raw Radio, a title that gave equal weight to N.O.R.E.'s Militainment brand, to EFN's Crazy Hood, and to 66 Raw, the channel on Sirius XM which carried the show. In early 2013, Santiago stated that he would yet again change his moniker, this time to P.A.P.I. (Acronym for Power Always Proves Intelligence), which stirred mixed reactions from his fans. On April 16, 2013 he released Student of the Game, and shortly after announced a sequel would be released as his next album. On September 27, 2013, he told MTV that his next album, Melvin Flynt II: Da Final Hustle will be his final album, as he will stop touring and releasing solo albums to focus on being a music executive and CEO. On October 30, 2015, Santiago tweeted: \\"New and last album in July!!!\\", followed by \\"Melvin Flynt 2? Or N.O.R.E. 2?\\". ==Legal troubles== On February 24, 2009, N.O.R.E. was arrested at a Fatburger hamburger restaurant in Miami Beach, FL, following a fight with a customer. ==Discography== ;Studio albums * N.O.R.E.

Chi Omega has 181 active collegiate chapters and approximately 240 alumnae chapters. Since its founding in 1895 at the University of Arkansas, the fraternity has initiated over 355,000 members with more than 28,000 undergraduates added each year, making it the largest women's fraternal organization by membership. Chi Omega's national headquarters are located in Memphis, Tennessee. ==History== Chi Omega was founded April 5, 1895 at the University of Arkansas by Ina May Boles, Jean Vincenheller, Jobelle Holcombe, and Alice Simonds, with the help of Dr. Charles Richardson (an initiate of the Kappa Sigma fraternity). This founding chapter is called the Psi Chapter. It first expanded in Fall 1898 with Chi chapter at Transylvania University; located in Lexington, Kentucky and Hellmuth Ladies' College, located in London, Ontario. Both chapters were transferred to other schools in 1903. By its 10th anniversary, in 1905, and with the support of Alumnae and Dr. Richardson, Chi Omega had installed 17 chapters throughout the United States. Chi Omega joined the National Panhellenic Conference in 1903. From 1947-1973, Chi Omega's headquarters were in the private home of two alumnae in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1973, Chi Omega moved to the 33rd floor of Carew Tower, the tallest building in Cincinnati. Chi Omega was the first women's Fraternity to have an Executive Office in an Office Building. In 1986, the Chi Omega Executive Office was moved to the 31st floor of the same office building, Carew Tower, until their move to the present location in Memphis, Tennessee in December 1993. Chi Omega Sorority House at Ohio University. In the late 1990s, the leadership in Chi Omega researched opportunities for a partnership with a national philanthropy, choosing the Make-A-Wish Foundation as their official philanthropy since 2002.Chi Omega: Alliance between Chi Omega and Make-A-Wish. Since the start of this alliance, Chi Omega has raised more than 19 million dollars and has volunteered over one million hours for Make-A-Wish and contributed more than a million dollars annually. Despite being a women's organization, Chi Omega only refers to itself as a women's fraternity instead of a sorority. As such, Chi Omega is the largest women's fraternal organization in the world with over 355,000 initiates and 181 collegiate chapters. The 300,000th member was initiated in 2013. ==Symbols== The white carnation is the official flower, while the skull and crossbones are the official symbol. The official colors are cardinal and straw. Chi Omega has two official jewels, the pearl and the diamond. The owl serves as the sorority's official mascot, symbolizing wisdom. Emblematically the owl teaches members to be watchful and guarded in their thoughts, words, and actions. Chi Omega's crest was adopted in 1902. Centered on the crest is a white carnation, with the Greek letter Chi to the left and the Greek letter Omega to the right of the flower. Above these symbols are both the symbols of the skull and crossbones and the owl. Beneath the carnation are five Greek letters: Rho, Beta, Upsilon, Eta and Sigma. The symbol is surrounded by a laurel wreath. The badge of Chi Omega was regulated and adopted in 1906. Dr. Charles Richardson designed the first badge, and made it completely out of scraps of hammered dental gold. The badge is a monogram of the Greek letter \\"Chi\\" superimposed over \\"Omega.\\" It is only allowed to be adorned with fourteen pearls or diamonds, disallowing the use of any other stones. The badge is to be worn only when wearing professional clothing, above all other pins and over the heart. Both the badge and the crest may only be used or worn by initiated members. ===Purposes=== Chi Omega is an \\"intergenerational women‚Äôs organization\\" that states its founding purposes as: \\"friendship, personal integrity, service to others, academic excellence and intellectual pursuits, community and campus involvement and personal and career development\\". The ethos of the fraternity is embodied in a document known as the Chi Omega Symphony, composed in 1904 by Ethel Switzer Howard of the Xi Chapter at Northwestern University. == Membership == ===Organization and leadership=== The fraternity's day-to-day business activities are overseen by the Governing Council; which consists of five elected alumnae, volunteer members, who are elected every two years. The current president of Chi Omega is Shelley Potter. Each chapter of Chi Omega receives at least an annual visit from a National Consultant who aids in the development of the members. Since 1899, The Eleusis is the official newsletter magazine of Chi Omega, named after the Greek myth. In 1899, it was edited by Ida Pace Purdue and delivered to less than 100 members. The subscription price was $1/year. An account of the founding, histories and pictures of the chapters, and a directory of the members were included in the first issue. In 2013, over 200,000 copies of The Eleusis were mailed out three times per year to collegiate and alumnae members.Chi Omega: The Eleusis The Nancy Walton Laurie Leadership Institute of Chi Omega is a leadership training program for collegiate and alumnae members. The sessions include a variety of topics based on personal development, and the program is available at various meetings and events. The Chi Omega Foundation supports the Laurie Leadership Institute. The Laurie Leadership Institute impacts Chi Omegas in a variety of ways, from the Flagship weekend in Memphis, Tennessee to leadership programming at Chi Omega Convention. Collegiate and alumnae chapters also have the opportunity to experience these workshops through Regional, Chapter, and even all-Panhellenic sessions throughout the year. ===Chapters=== ===Notable alumnae=== ==Controversies== In 1971, the Delta Nu chapter at Dickinson College attempted to recruit an African-American woman as a member, and the national organization refused permission. Delta Nu separated from the national organization over this issue and became an independent sorority. In 2013, the chapter at Pennsylvania State University was shut down after the sorority threw an offensive party insulting Mexican-American culture. National leadership of the sorority released a statement saying the party was not congruent with Chi Omega's values and purpose. In 2013 and 2014, sorority women from multiple chapters at the University of Alabama ‚Äì including Chi Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Pi Beta Phi, Kappa Delta, Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Omicron Pi, and Phi Mu ‚Äì alleged that either active members or some of their alumnae had prevented them from offering membership to black candidates because of their race. An anonymous Chi Omega member told the school newspaper, The Crimson White, that their university-employed rush adviser dropped a black girl who received perfect scores after the first round of recruitment. Afterwards, chapter members requested that the Chi Omega national headquarters investigate the incident for racial discrimination, and one member of the chapter's executive board moved out of the chapter house and resigned her membership. Students held a campus march to integrate Greek life on campus, and following media and national outcry, the university held a second round of recruitment in hopes of offering membership to more women, including black women. In 2014, the chapter at the University of Central Florida was suspended after allegations surfaced of sorority members blindfolding two pledges under the legal drinking age and taking them to the woods to drink an entire bottle of rum. According to the police report, one pledge ended up so intoxicated that she injured herself in a fall. Members of the sorority directly involved with the hazing incident later resigned from the sorority. In 2014, a member at the University of Alabama was kicked out of the sorority after releasing a racially offensive picture that included a racial slur on social media, celebrating that the chapter had not offered membership to any black women that year. The university's president and sorority's leadership both released statements condemning the photo and acknowledging the importance of embracing diversity. In 2016, a sorority member at the University of Nebraska at Omaha was kicked out of the sorority for posting pictures wearing her sorority letters in her Tinder profile. The incident made it to a Good Morning America segment where she states she was unfairly treated and targeted by members of the sorority. ===News=== In 1978, serial killer Ted Bundy entered the Chi Omega sorority house at Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida on January 15. Ted Bundy attacked four women, two of whom were killed (Lisa Levy and Margaret Bowman).* ==See also== *List of social fraternities and sororities ==References== ==External links== * Chi Omega's official website Category:Student organizations established in 1895 Category:Student societies in the United States Category:National Panhellenic Conference Category:1895 establishments in Arkansas ","title":"Chi Omega"},{"id":"1436370","text":"In historical linguistics, a macrofamily, also called a superfamily or phylum, is a proposed genetic relationship grouping together language families (also isolates) in a larger scale classification.Campbell, Lyle and Mixco, Mauricio J.

It is mostly flat with some minor rises. Scenery includes park lands, the creek valley, and semi-rural suburbia. The trail is fully paved with either concrete or asphalt and is not much affected by tree roots. It is a trail for leisurely riding rather than high-speed commuting and is shared with walkers, family groups, children, dogs (on leash) and the elderly. The path is narrow in parts and has many added 90 degree bends to vary interest. The trail is poorly signposted and there are a two points where the unwary traveller can become easily lost. There are also road crossings and an unprotected rail crossing. The main features are Edendale Farm Community Environment Centre and Diamond Valley Railway. ==Following the Path== The start of the trail is unmarked but starts not far from Diamond Creek station. From the station cross Main Hurstbridge Road, turn right and cross the road bridge. The trail starts on the other side of the bridge next to the toilet block at Diamond Creek Reserve. The trail appears to end at Allendale Road, Diamond Creek. To pick it up turn left along Allendale Rd towards the railway crossing ‚Äì the trail runs alongside the track. Between here and Eltham you pass Edendale Farm (admission fee payable) or check out the animals at the back fence. At Edendale Farm you can divert to another trail that follows Main Rd and meets with the Maroondah Aqueduct Trail. The Maroondah Aqueduct Trail in turn, loops back to Diamond Creek Trail back at Allendale Rd. To keep the cycling grades to a minimum, always do the Maroondah Aqueduct Trail loop anti-clockwise. The trail then runs along Railway Parade until it crosses the railway track opposite Elsa Court. You must dismount to cross the track. This is an open, unguarded crossing. The track then runs along the footpath into the Eltham business district. Eltham railway station is 300 metres down the footpath after the crossing. Continuing the trail again disappears. One block after the Elsa Court crossing turn right into Diamond St and then continue left in front of the tennis centre. Keep straight on for 200 metres ‚Äì the trail resumes on the other side of the tennis centre, at Eltham Central Park. At Withers Way, Eltham, the trail appears to run straight ahead towards Eltham High School. In fact, turn sharp left and cross the footbridge. At this point a detour to the nearby Montsalvat can be made by crossing Main Rd at the pedestrian crossing and heading up Dalton St. Continuing, the trail narrows and twists through the park, until it comes to Eltham Lower Park. The park is famous for the Diamond Valley Railway, much-loved by generations of children (and adults). On the south side of Eltham Lower Park continue to the left (east) where the path meets up with the footbridge across the Yarra. Crossing the footbridge leads directly to the Yarra River Trail about 1 km east of Westerfolds Park. Cycling time at a leisurely pace: one hour. The next railway station is Heidelberg, about 14 kilometres along the Yarra River Trail. == Landmarks == Edendale Farm Community, Montsalvat, Diamond Valley Railway. ==Connections== The northern end meets with a trail on Main Rd that leads to the Maroondah Aqueduct Trail.

It was cancelled in 1943. == Design == By the time of the Battle of Britain the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka had proved very vulnerable to enemy fighters and needed replacement, so after rejection of the Ju 87F proposal a new dive bomber was designed under the designation Ju 187. The projected aircraft kept some of the features of the earlier Ju 87, such as the inverted gull wing and two man crew. It would have added retractable landing gear, as well as improved armour and armament. Most notably, the Ju 187 incorporated a rotating vertical tail. When rotated down, the tail would give the air gunner, armed with a rear turret, an unobstructed field of fire. It is not known how the aircraft would have handled with the tail rotated. The Ju 187 project was cancelled by the Reich Air Ministry in autumn 1943 because the aircraft's projected performance, when fully loaded, was estimated to be no better than the latest Ju 87D variant (estimated maximum speed: ). ==Specifications (Ju 187 estimated)== ==References == ==Further reading== * * RLM: V-Muster-Programm, November 1942 * JFM AG: Anhang I der Aufsichts- und Verwaltungsratsitzung der JFM AG am 15. und 16.

Operational art is defined by its military-political scope, not by force size, scale of operations or degree of effort. Likewise, operational art provides theory and skills, and the operational level permits doctrinal structure and process. ==Background== During the 18th and early 19th centuries, the synonymous term grand tactics (or, less frequently, maneuver tactics) was often used to describe the manoeuvres of troops not tactically engaged, while in the late 19th century to the First World War and through the Second World War, the term minor strategy was used by some military commentators.p.218, Jablonskyp.28, Whitman Confusion over terminology was brought up in professional military publications, that sought to identify \\"...slightly different shades of meaning, such as tactics, major tactics, minor tactics, grand strategy, major strategy, and minor strategy\\".p.3, Bundel The term was not widely used in the United States or Britain before 1980‚Äì1981, when it became much discussed and started to enter military doctrines and officer combat training courses.p. 111, Stone ==Application== Operational art comprises four essential elements: time, space, means and purpose. Each element is found in greater complexity at the operational level than at the tactical or strategic level. This is true, in part, because operational art must consider and incorporate more of the strategic and tactical levels than those levels must absorb from the operational level. Although much can be gained by examining the four elements independently, it is only when they are viewed together that operational art reveals its intricate fabric. The challenge of operational art is to establish a four-element equilibrium that permits the optimal generation and application of military power in achieving the political goal. Viewing time, space, means and purpose as a whole requires great skill in organizing, weighing and envisioning masses of complex, often contradictory factors. These factors often exist for extended periods, over great distances and with shifting mixes of players, systems and beliefs, pursuing political goals which may or may not be clear, cogent or settled. Compounding factors, such as the opponent's actions, create further ambiguity. ===Mission analysis=== The operational- level strategist possesses numerous tools to frame and guide their thinking, but chief among these are mission analysis and end state. Mission analysis answers the question \\"What is to be accomplished?\\" Through mission analysis, the operational-level planner fuses political aims and military objectives. In so doing, the planner determines what application of military force will create military power to achieve the political purpose. Subordinate processes here include defining objectives and centers of gravity, but excessive dependence on analytical mechanisms can create false security. The final test rewards success, not the quality of the argument. Conversely, the planner cannot hope to \\"feel\\" a way to victory‚Äîcomplexity demands an integration of thought and effort. ===End state=== End state answers the question \\"What will constitute success?\\" The campaign end state is not merely a desired status quo of the military goal. It also establishes a touchstone for the tactical, operational and strategic levels. The end state manifests the intended results of military power and exposes any limitations. Indeed, an achievable end state may require the employment of nonmilitary elements of national power. As such, it recognizes that military power alone may not be capable of attaining political success. ==Skills required== An operational-level strategy must continually inventory and weigh time, space, means and purpose, extrapolating from them outcomes and likelihood. To accomplish this, practitioners need both skill and theory, experience and knowledge. At the operational level, skills and experience must usually be developed indirectly, through formal training, military history and real-world practicum. Success at the tactical level is no guarantee of success at the operational level: mastery of operational art demands strategic skills. Without a strong grounding in the theory and application of operational art, a successful tactician has little hope of making the demanding leap from tactics. The operational level strategist must see clearly and expansively from the foxhole into the corridors of national or coalition authority. They must be aware of the plausibility and coherence of strategic aims, national will and the players who decide them. Successful operational art charts a clear, unbroken path from the individual soldier's efforts to the state or coalition's goals. == Role in historiography == While the emerging corpus of operational art and the establishment of a specifically operational level of war are relatively new, in practice operational art has existed throughout recorded history. Peoples and commanders have long pursued political goals through military actions, and one can examine campaigns of any period from the existential perspective of operational art. Current schools of thought on the operational art share the fundamental view that military success can be measured only in the attainment of political-strategic aims, and thus historians can analyze any war in terms of operational art. In the case of World War II analysis, the Wehrmacht did not use the operational level as a formal doctrinal concept during the campaigns of 1939‚Äì1945. While personnel within the German forces knew of operational art, awareness and practice was limited principally to general-staff trained officers. Nevertheless, the existential nature of operational art means that examining a campaign or an operation against political aims is valid irrespective of the doctrine or structures of the period. Thus the elements of operational art‚Äîtime, space, means and purpose‚Äîcan illuminate thoughts and actions of any era, regardless of the prevailing contemporary doctrine or structure. == See also == * Grand strategy * Maskirovka * Military doctrine * Military strategy * Military tactics * Naval strategy * Principles of war * Strategy == References == === Notes === === Bibliography === * Bundel, C.

However, while on holiday in the Greek islands during the year of 1999, Nordstr√∂m met the young guitarist Gus G (from Firewind). The musicians got along quite well, despite an age difference of over a decade. Plans for a band commenced - Gus had already been planning to relocate to Gothenburg, and upon his arrival he looked up Fredrik at Studio Fredman to begin writing. The first person asked to join the new band was Snowy Shaw (from King Diamond, Mercyful Fate and Notre Dame), but the drummer initially refused their invitation. He would later change his mind and agreed to play on the band's debut album in a session capacity. Vocalist Niklas Isfeldt had done backing vocals for some of HammerFall's songs produced by Nordstr√∂m, and since he was not involved in any major projects at the time, he agreed to take the position. He also brought along his longtime friend and Pure-X bandmate Peter St√•lfors, who assumed bass guitar duties. Up until the moment the first promotional photos were shot, the entire band had never been in the same place at the same time before. Some members did not even know each other. The band soon got a deal with Century Media Records, and intended to name themselves Dragonslayer due to the medieval and fantastical themes of the songs written by Gus and Nordstr√∂m. The label did not find the name original enough, and thus the band settled for the name Dream Evil, inspired by the Dio album of the same name. Dream Evil's debut album was released in April 2002, and received positive feedback from the metal press. At one point the album, titled Dragonslayer, reached number one on the Japanese import charts. The band proceeded to play a series of festivals, and also supported Blind Guardian during a part of their world tour. The band members found that they got along well as a unit, despite the somewhat random manner by which they had been brought together - Snowy Shaw decided to join the band permanently, and Dream Evil went on their first Japanese tour. During their stay in Japan, the band was invited by HammerFall to support their 2003 European tour. Their label manager hinted that it would be a good idea to have a new album out by then. With little time on their hands, the band wrote the basis of several songs on the flight back to Europe, and on the day of their arrival entered the studio in order to record a new album. They took two weeks in total to record Evilized, and most songs were recorded as they had been written. It was released on 20 January, and one week later Dream Evil proceeded to tour Europe with HammerFall and the less known Masterplan. For their third album, the band actually took time to write the songs and fine-tune them in the studio. The Book of Heavy Metal took two months to be recorded, and was released in May 2004. Guitarist Gus G left the band in late 2004 in order to dedicate more time to Firewind, being replaced by Mark Black (then known as Mark U Black). Black had previously filled in for Gus on a few other occasions and replaced him permanently on their tour as support act for Saxon. Niklas Isfeldt and Peter St√•lfors briefly left in 2005 to be replaced by Jake E. Berg (aka Jake Steel, of Dreamland) and Tommy Larsson. However, a few months later, Niklas and Pater returned before recordings or live shows were done. At the start of 2006, Snowy Shaw abruptly quit Dream Evil. After a period of silence for several months, Dream Evil announced Pat Power (Patrik Jerksten), a co-worker of Fredrik Nordstr√∂m from Studio Fredman, as Snowy's replacement. The first album featuring the new line-up, United, was released on October 13, 2006. Dream Evil announced on December 7, 2007 on the website that Mark Black would be leaving the band and will be replaced by Daniel Varghamne aka Dannee Demon. On March 3, 2008, the band announced that they had begun work on a new studio album, tentatively titled In the Night. The album was released on January 25, 2010 in Europe and January 26, 2010 in North America. On July 23, 2008, the band announced that their first live DVD/CD set, Gold Medal in Metal (Alive & Archive), was released on August 25, 2008. On December 28, 2013 Dream Evil announced that Dannee Demon left the band and was replaced by Mark Black. Upon contact in 2015, Dream Evil informed that they were not on hiatus, just very busy with other commitments, and had eighteen tracks prepared for a future album. On March 7, 2017, the album, titled Six, was finally announced to be released on May 26, 2017. ==Members== Current members *Fredrik Nordstr√∂m ‚Äì rhythm guitar (1999‚Äìpresent) *Niklas Isfeldt ‚Äì vocals (1999‚Äìpresent (small hiatus in 2005)) *Peter St√•lfors ‚Äì bass guitar (1999‚Äìpresent (small hiatus in 2005)) *Markus Fristedt ‚Äì lead guitar (2004‚Äì2007, 2013‚Äìpresent) *Sir N ‚Äì drums (2019-present) Former members *Snowy Shaw ‚Äì drums (1999‚Äì2006) *Gus G ‚Äì lead guitar (1999‚Äì2004) *Daniel Varghamne ‚Äì lead guitar (2007-2013) *Jake E.

It was discovered on 19 February 2001, by astronomers of the Lincoln Near- Earth Asteroid Research at the Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site in New Mexico, United States. The asteroid was named for novelist Douglas Adams. == Orbit and classification == Douglasadams is a member of the Nysa family (), better described as the Nysa‚ÄìPolana complex, as it contains at least three asteroid families with distinct spectral types (SFC). It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.0‚Äì2.8 AU once every 3 years and 9 months (1,371 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 2¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken by Spacewatch at Kitt Peak Observatory in January 1997, more than four years prior to its official discovery observation at Lincoln Lab's ETS. == Physical characteristics == The spectral type of Douglasadams is unknown. Based on its albedo (see below) it is likely a common stony S-type asteroid. === Diameter and albedo === According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Douglasadams measures 2.410 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.210. It has an absolute magnitude of 15.6. === Rotation period === As of 2017, no rotational lightcurve of Douglasadams has been obtained from photometric observations. The asteroid's rotation period, poles and shape remain unknown. == Naming == This minor planet was named in memory of English novelist Douglas Adams (1952‚Äì2001), because its provisional designation happened to contain the year of his death, his initials, and the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything (42), as given in his novel serial The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 25 January 2005 ().

He was one of the Hollywood Ten and later blacklisted by the Hollywood movie studio bosses. ==Life and career== ===Early life=== Scott was born in Arlington, New Jersey, the son of successful Irish Catholic parents ‚Äî his father worked in middle management for the New York Telephone Company. Arlington was one of the centers of the American textile industry, a key site in the history of industrial capitalism and a hotbed of radical labor agitation. Arlington is 12 miles south of Paterson, where the 1913 strike of 25,000 silk workers brought together socialists, Wobblies, and Greenwich Village intellectuals. In 1926, when Scott was 15, 20,000 textile workers in nearby Passaic, New Jersey, closed down the mills. Scott's older brother Allan was a playwright (and later screenwriter), whose comedy Goodbye Again ran on Broadway for most of 1933. Adrian's college yearbook in Amherst College described him: \\"Hat cocked back at a rakish angle, cigar in the corner of his mouth, his fingers playing nimbly over the typewriter keys, the inimitable R.A.L. Scott.\\" Scott graduated from Amherst in 1934. He was a film critic and associate editor of Stage magazine from 1936 through 1938. He moved to Hollywood, California, in 1939. ===Screenwriter=== Scott broke into Hollywood as a screenwriter. He worked on the script for Keeping Company (1940) at MGM, We Go Fast (1941) at 20th Century Fox, and The Parson of Panamint (1941) at Paramount. Scott wrote Mr. Lucky (1943) at RKO, which was a hit. ===Producer=== RKO signed Scott to work as a producer. His first credit in that capacity was My Pal Wolf (1944). He went on to produce Murder, My Sweet (1944), an adaption of Farewell My Lovely by Raymond Chandler by John Paxton that was directed by Edward Dmytryk. It was a critical and commercial success. The cast included Dick Powell, who revitalized his career in the role of Philip Marlowe, and Ann Shirley, whom Scott married. , Scott, Dmytryk, Powell, and Paxton reunited on Cornered (1945). Scott then produced Deadline at Dawn (1946), the only feature film directed by Harold Clurman. Dmytryk, Paxton, and he reunited on So Well Remembered (1947) shot in England. More successful was Crossfire (1947), another collaboration among the three men. Crossfire was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and was a popular success.Richard B. Jewell, Slow Fade to Black: The Decline of RKO Radio Pictures, University of California, 2016 Scott produced The Boy with Green Hair (1948), directed by Joseph Losey, which was a box-office flop.Scott Eyman, Lion of Hollywood: The Life and Legend of Louis B. Mayer, Robson, 2005 p 420 He is credited on the script for Miss Susie Slagle's (1946) at Paramount. ===Blacklisting=== Scott joined the Communist Party USA in 1944. In October 1947, Scott was called to testify during the House Committee on Un- American Activities hearings on Hollywood, but as did nine others, refused to testify. RKO fired him on October 29, 1947, for refusing to answer questions. For the first year of the blacklist, he returned to journalism, contributing to the London journal Cine-Technician. He was sentenced to prison along with the other members of the Hollywood Ten. Edward Dmytryk, another of the Hollywood Ten, chose to become a 'friendly' witness and testified before the HUAC in 1951 that Scott pressured him to put communist propaganda in his films. In 1955, Scott published an essay titled \\"Blacklist: The Liberal's Straightjacket and Its Effect on Content\\" in Hollywood Review. From 1954 to 1961, Scott made a living writing for television.Bernard F. Dick, Radical Innocence: A Critical Study of the Hollywood Ten (Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky, 1989): 133. These shows included The Adventures of Robin Hood and The Adventures of Sir Lancelot. He provided the story for Conspiracy of Hearts (1960) under a pseudonym. He moved to England in 1961. In 1963, MGM- British hired Scott as a production executive, effectively ending his blacklisting. ===Later career=== Scott attempted to make a return to feature- film production in 1967 by producing a new adaption of Monsieur Lecoq; the film was never finished. Film stills featuring the movie's actress Julie Newmar were featured in the September 1969 edition of Playboy. Shortly before his death, Scott made a television adaption of The Great Man's Whiskers and was credited with his legal name. ==Personal life== Scott was married to actress Anne Shirley, who subsequently married another screenwriter, Charles Lederer, nephew of Marion Davies. He later married Joan Scott (n√©e LaCour), fellow screenwriter and producer. Joan sometimes served as Adrian's front when he was unable to publish under his own name, and later the surname LaCour was used by both when writing in Hollywood. Adrian was the brother of screenwriter Allan Scott, who is the father of actress Pippa Scott. Adrian Scott died from lung cancer in 1972 in Sherman Oaks, California. ==Papers== Joan and Adrian Scott's papers can be found at the American Heritage Center in Laramie, Wyoming. ==Referencesthe Adrian Scott Archive Category:1911 births Category:1972 deaths Category:American communists Category:American film producers Category:American male screenwriters Category:Deaths from cancer in California Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:Hollywood blacklist Category:Members of the Communist Party USA Category:People from Kearny, New Jersey Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:20th-century American male writers Category:20th- century American writers ","title":"Adrian Scott"},{"id":"1436428","text":"Clemenceau may refer to: * Georges Clemenceau (1841‚Äì1929), French statesman; leader in First World War * Martine Cl√©menceau (born 1949), French singer * Clemenceau-class aircraft carrier, a class of aircraft carriers of the French Navy ** Clemenceau (R 98), the lead ship of the class * Clemenceau metro station, a Brussels metro station * Mount Clemenceau, a mountain in the Canadian Rockies * Rue Cl√©menceau, a commercial and residential street in Beirut, Lebanon * Clemenceau, Arizona, a former smelter town * Clemenceau, Saskatchewan, a hamlet in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan ","title":"Clemenceau"},{"id":"1436431","text":" L√â Deirdre (P20) was a ship in the Irish Naval Service. She was named after Deirdre, a tragic heroine from Irish mythology who committed suicide after her lover's murder. Built in 1972, Deirdre was built as a replacement for the s, and one of the first vessels custom-built for the Irish Naval Service. She was to have longer range and be a more seaworthy ship for work in the Atlantic. Deirdre became the prototype for the later -type vessels. National Maritime Museum Deirdre undertook a number of search and rescue operations throughout her careers. For example, Deirdre was one of the vessels involved in the 1979 Fastnet race rescue operations, assisting the crews of two yachts. In 1990, during the rescue of a Spanish trawler crew in Bantry Bay, a member of Deirdre's crew died ‚Äì and was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Medal and Spanish Cross of Naval Merit. By the time of the vessel's naval decommissioning in early 2001, Deirdre had travelled approximately 450,000 nautical miles. She was replaced by a R√≥is√≠n-class patrol vessel. Deirdre was sold at public auction for IR¬£190,000 in . She was purchased by the English yacht chartering company Seastream International for conversion into luxury charter yacht Tosca IV for the company's owner, businessman Christopher Matthews. Speaking on the radio, a Seastream spokesman appeared pleased with their bargain as they had been prepared to bid up to IR¬£500,000. The auction starting price had been IR¬£60,000. The conversion in a Polish shipyard was not completed as the English owner died. In 2007 she was towed to Brazil for further refit and completion. Substantially complete, she arrived at Jacksonville, Florida in September 2012 for final outfitting as Santa Rita I.

The song was also performed at Led Zeppelin's reunion show at the O2 Arena, London on 10 December 2007. \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" was featured on Led Zeppelin's 1976 concert film (and accompanying soundtrack), as part of Plant's fantasy sequence. The title of the song was used as the title of both the film and the album. \\"The Song Remains The Same (Guitar Overdub Reference Mix)\\", an instrumental version of the song, appears on the second disc of the remastered 2-CD deluxe edition of Houses of the Holy. It was recorded on 18 May 1972, at the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio at Stargroves, with engineer Eddie Kramer and mix engineer George Chkiantz. It runs 5:30, while the original runs 5:24. ==Reception== In a contemporary review of Houses of the Holy, Gordon Fletcher of Rolling Stone gave \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" a mixed review, writing that the track is \\"the only other tune [on the album, except for \\"The Ocean\\"] approaching the Zep's past triumphs\\" and \\"works solely as a vehicle for Page's guitar antics\\". In a retrospective review of Houses of the Holy (Deluxe Edition), Kristofer Lenz of Consequence of Sound gave \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" a more positive review, praising every band member and writing that \\"as the band moves through the many changes of ‚ÄúThe Song Remains the Same‚Äù, they are tight yet nimble, proficient yet unpretentious.\\" ==See also== *List of cover versions of Led Zeppelin songs ==References== ==External links== * Category:1973 songs Category:Led Zeppelin songs Category:Songs written by Jimmy Page Category:Songs written by Robert Plant Category:Song recordings produced by Jimmy Page Category:Songs about music Category:Metasongs ","title":"The Song Remains the Same (song)"},{"id":"1436438","text":"Ogun State is a state in southwestern Nigeria.

Two versions were intended to be produced, a twin-engine version using the Junkers Jumo 222 engine and a four-engine variant which was to have used the smaller Daimler-Benz DB 605 engine. The project was eventually abandoned due to technical difficulties with the engines.Jane's 1989, p. 165. ==Design and development== In July 1939, the RLM issued a specification for a high-performance medium bomber (the \\"Bomber B\\" program). It was to have a maximum speed of 600 km/h (370 mph) and be able to carry a bomb load of 4,000 kg (8,820 lb) to any part of Britain from bases in France or Norway. Furthermore, the new bomber was to have a pressurized crew compartment, of the then-generalized \\"stepless cockpit\\" design (with no separate windscreen for the pilot) pioneered by the He 111P shortly before the war and used on most German bombers during the war, remotely controlled armament, and was to utilize two of the new 2,500 PS (2,466 hp, 1,839 kW) class of engines then being developed (Jumo 222 or Daimler-Benz DB 604), with the Jumo 222 being specified for the great majority of such twin-engined designs, that Arado, Dornier, Focke-Wulf and Junkers had created airframe designs to use. The Arado Ar E340 was eliminated. The Dornier Do 317 was put on a low-priority development contract; and the Junkers Ju 288 and Focke-Wulf Fw 191 were chosen for full development. Dipl. Ing E. K√∂sel, who also worked on the Fw 189 reconnaissance plane, was supposed to have led the design team for the Fw 191. Overall, the Fw 191 was a clean, all-metal aircraft that featured a shoulder- mounted wing. Two 24-cylinder Jumo 222 engines (which showed more promise than the DB 604 engines) were mounted in nacelles on the wings. An interesting feature was the inclusion of the Multhopp-Klappe, an ingenious form of combined landing flap and dive brake, which was developed by Hans Multhopp. The entire fuel supply was carried in five tanks located above the internal bomb bay, and in two tanks in the wing between the engine nacelles and fuselage. The tail section was of a twin fins and rudders design, with the tailplane having a small amount of dihedral. The main landing gear legs retracted to the rear and rotated 90¬∞ to lie flat in each engine nacelle with the mainwheels resting atop the lower ends of the gear struts when fully retracted, much like the main gear on the production versions of the Ju 88 already did. Also, the tailwheel retracted forwards into the fuselage. A crew of four sat in the pressurized cockpit, and a large Plexiglas dome was provided for the navigator; the radio operator could also use this dome to aim the remotely controlled rear guns. The Fw 191 followed established Luftwaffe practice in concentrating the crew in the nose compartment, also including the nearly ubiquitous Bola, inverted-casemate undernose gondola for defensive weapons mounts first used on the Ju 88A before the war, and in the use of a \\"stepless cockpit\\", having no separate windscreen for the pilot, as the later -P and -H versions of the Heinkel He 111 already did. This was pressurised for high-altitude operations.Jane's 1989, p.266. The proposed operational armament consisted of one 20 mm MG 151 cannon in a chin turret, twin 20 mm MG 151 in a remotely controlled dorsal turret, twin 20 mm MG 151 in a remotely controlled ventral turret, a tail turret with one or two machine guns and remotely controlled weapons in the rear of the engine nacelles. However, different combinations were mounted in the prototype aircraft. Sighting stations were provided above the crew compartment, as well as at the ends of the aforementioned Bola beneath the nose. The aircraft had an internal bomb bay. In addition, bombs or torpedoes could be carried on external racks between the fuselage and the engine nacelles. The design was to have had a maximum speed of 600 km/h (370 mph), a bomb load of 4,000 kg (8,820 lb), and a range allowing it to bomb any target in Britain from bases in France and Norway. ===Failure and end of program=== It is said that the intention to use electric power for almost all of the aircraft's auxiliary systems (also a fact for the successful Fw 190 fighter), requiring the installation of a large number of electric motors and wiring led to the nickname for the Fw 191 of \\"Das fliegende Kraftwerk\\" (the flying powerstation). This also had the detrimental effect of adding even more weight to the overburdened airframe, plus there was also the danger of a single enemy bullet putting every system out of action if the generator was hit. Dipl. Ing Melhorn took the Fw 191 V1 on its maiden flight early in 1942, with immediate problems arising from the lower rated engines not providing enough power, as was anticipated. One surprising problem that was encountered were the Multhopp-Klappe, which presented severe flutter problems when extended, and pointed to the need for a redesign. At this point, only dummy gun installations were fitted and no bomb load was carried. After completing ten test flights, the Fw 191 V1 was joined by the similar V2, but only a total of ten hours of test flight time was logged. The 2,500 PS (2,466 hp, 1,839 kW) Junkers Jumo 222 engines which would have powered the Fw 191 proved troublesome. In total only three prototype aircraft, V1, V2 and V6, were built. The project was crippled by engine problems and an extensive use of electrical motor-driven systems. Problems arose almost immediately when the Jumo 222 engines were not ready in time for the first flight tests, so a pair of 1,560 PS (1,539 hp, 1,147 kW) BMW 801A radial engines were fitted. This made the Fw 191 V1 seriously underpowered. Another problem arose with the RLM's insistence that all systems that would normally be hydraulic or mechanically activated should be operated by electric motors. At this point, the RLM allowed the redesign and removal of the electric motors (to be replaced by the standard hydraulics), so the Fw 191 V3, V4 and V5 were abandoned. The Fw 191 V6 was then modified to the new design, and also a pair of specially prepared Jumo 222 engines were fitted that developed 2,200 PS (2,170 hp, 1,618 kW) for takeoff. The first flight of the new Fw 191 took place in December 1942 with Flugkapit√§n Hans Sander at the controls. Although the V6 flew better, the Jumo 222 were still not producing their design power, and the whole Jumo 222 development prospect was looking bad due to the shortage of special metals for it. The Fw 191 V6 was to have been the production prototype for the Fw 191A series. Due to the German aviation engine industry having ongoing problems in producing powerplant designs capable of output levels matching or exceeding the 1,500 kW (2,000 PS) figure throughout the entirety of the war years, that had any demonstrable level of combat-ready reliability, the Jumo 222 engines were having a lot of teething problems, and the Daimler Benz DB 604 had already been abandoned, a new proposal was put forth for the Fw 191B series. The V7 through V12 machines were abandoned in favor of using the Fw 191 V13 to install a pair of Daimler Benz DB 606 or 610 \\"power system\\" engines, which were basically coupled pairs of either DB 601 or 605 12-cylinder engines. Their lower power-to-weight ratio, however, from their 1.5 tonne weight apiece for each \\"power system\\", meant that the armament and payload would have to be reduced. It had already been decided to delete the engine nacelle gun turrets, and to make the rest manually operated. Five more prototypes were planned with the new engine arrangement, V14 through V18, but none were ever built, possibly from the August 1942 condemnation by Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring of the coupled \\"power system\\" DB 606 and 610 powerplants as \\"welded-together engines\\", in regards to their being the primary cause of the unending series of powerplant problems in their primary use, as the engines on Heinkel's He 177A Greif, Germany's only production heavy bomber of World War II. One final attempt was made to save the Fw 191 program, this time the Fw 191C was proposed as a four engined aircraft, using either the 1,340 PS (1,322 hp, 986 kW) Jumo 211F, the 1,350 PS (1,332 hp, 993 kW) DB 601E, the 1,475 PS (1,455 hp, 1,085 kW) DB 605A or similar rated DB 628 engines. Also, the cabin would be unpressurized and the guns manually operated, with a rear step in the bottom of the deepened fuselage ‚Äî in the manner of the near-ubiquitous Bola gondola used by the majority of German bombers for ventral defense under the nose ‚Äî being provided for the gunner. Focke-Wulf used the designations Fw 391 and Fw 491 for the different variants of the Fw 191C, but these were unofficial and never allocated by the RLM.http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_focke-wulf_Fw_191.htmlHerwig, Dieter; Rode, Heinz (2000). Luftwaffe secret projects : strategic bombers 1935-45 (1st English ed.). Earl Shilton: Midland. p 29. . However, at this time, the whole \\"Bomber B\\" program had been canceled, due mainly to no engines of the 2,500 PS class being available, which was one of the primary requirements in the \\"Bomber B\\" program. Although the Fw 191 will be remembered as a failure, the air frame and overall design eventually proved themselves to be sound; only the underpowered engines and insistence on electric motors to operate all the systems eventually doomed the aircraft. All in all, there were only three Fw 191s ever built (V1, V2 and V6), and no examples of the Fw 191B or C ever advanced past the design stage. The RLM kept in reserve for Focke- Wulf the future number: Fw 391 for follow-up designs, but nothing ever developed. The project was eventually scrapped. ==Specifications (Fw 191B - DB 610 engines)== ==See also== Comparable aircraft * Avro Manchester * Dornier Do 317 * Junkers Ju 288 * Martin XB-33 ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1945, page 117c and addendum 23 * Jane's Fighting Aircraft of World War II.

Mammal classification has been through several iterations since Carl Linnaeus initially defined the class. No classification system is universally accepted; McKenna & Bell (1997) and Wilson & Reader (2005) provide useful recent compendiums. Many earlier ideas from Linnaeus et al. have been completely abandoned by modern taxonomists, among these are the idea that bats are related to birds or that humans represent a group outside of other living things. Competing ideas about the relationships of mammal orders do persist and are currently in development. Most significantly in recent years, cladistic thinking has led to an effort to ensure that all taxonomic designations represent monophyletic groups. The field has also seen a recent surge in interest and modification due to the results of molecular phylogenetics. George Gaylord Simpson's classic \\"Principles of Classification and a Classification of Mammals\\" (Simpson, 1945) taxonomy text laid out a systematics of mammal origins and relationships that was universally taught until the end of the 20th century. Since Simpson's 1945 classification, the paleontological record has been recalibrated, and the intervening years have seen much debate and progress concerning the theoretical underpinnings of systematization itself, partly through the new concept of cladistics. Though field work gradually made Simpson's classification outdated, it remained the closest thing to an official classification of mammals. See List of placental mammals and List of monotremes and marsupials for more detailed information on mammal genera and species. ==Molecular classification of placentals== Molecular studies by molecular systematists, based on DNA analysis, in the early 21st century have revealed new relationships among mammal families. Classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placental mammals, Afrotheria, Xenarthra, and Boreotheria. which diverged from early common ancestors in the Cretaceous. The relationships between these three lineages is contentious, and all three have been proposed as basal in different hypotheses. The first divergence was that of the Afrotheria 110-100 million years ago (mya). The Afrotheria proceeded to evolve and diversify in the isolation of the African-Arabian continent. The Xenarthra, isolated in South America, diverged from the Boreoeutheria approximately 100-95 mya. The Boreoeutheria split into the Laurasiatheria and Euarchontoglires between 95 and 85 mya; both of these groups evolved on the northern continent of Laurasia. After tens of millions of years of relative isolation, Africa-Arabia collided with Eurasia, and the formation of the Isthmus of Panama linked South America and North America, facilitating the distribution of mammals seen today. With the exception of bats and murine rodents, no placental land mammals reached Australasia until the first human settlers arrived approximately 50,000 years ago. It should however be noted that these molecular results are still controversial mainly because they are not reflected by morphological data and thus not accepted by many systematists. It is also important to note that fossil taxa are not and, in most cases cannot, be included. Although there are instances of DNA being recovered from prehistoric mammals such as the ground sloth Mylodon and Neanderthal humans, Homo neanderthalensis, fossils can generally only be incorporated in morphological analyses.

classroom textbooks. The following taxonomy of extant and recently extinct mammals is taken from the 6th edition of Vaughan's Mammalogy. This approach emphasizes an initial split between egg-laying prototherians and live-bearing therians. The therians are further divided into the marsupial Metatheria and the \\"placental\\" Eutheria. No attempt is made in this classification to further distinguish among the orders within these subclasses and infraclasses. This system also makes no note of the position of entirely fossil groups. In this and later taxonomies, families are merely listed under the order to which they belong. More detailed relationships among families is presented in the article of each order. ===Subclass Prototheria=== *Order Monotremata **Family Tachyglossidae (echidnas) **Family Ornithorhynchidae

McKenna and Susan K. Bell, which has resulted in the \\"McKenna/Bell classification\\". McKenna and Bell, Classification of Mammals: Above the species level, (McKenna & Bell, 1997) is a comprehensive work on the systematics, relationships, and occurrences of all mammal taxa, living and extinct, down through the rank of genus. The authors worked together as paleontologists at the American Museum of Natural History, New York. McKenna inherited the project from Simpson and, with Bell, constructed a completely updated hierarchical system, covering living and extinct taxa that reflects the historical genealogy of Mammalia. The McKenna/Bell hierarchical listing of all of the terms used for mammal groups above the species includes extinct mammals as well as modern groups, and introduces some fine distinctions such as legions and sublegions and ranks which fall between classes and orders that are likely to be glossed over by the layman. Click on the highlighted link for a table comparing the traditional and the new McKenna/Bell classifications of mammals. Extinct groups are represented by ‚Ä†. ===Subclass Prototheria=== (monotremes) *Order Platypoda: platypuses **Family Ornithorhynchidae: platypuses *Order Tachyglossa: echidnas (spiny anteaters)

discoveries have been made that have led researchers to question many of the relationships proposed by McKenna and Bell (1997). Additionally, researchers are subjecting taxonomic hypotheses to more rigorous cladistic analyses of early mammal fossils. Luo et al. (2002) summarized existing ideas and proposed new ideas of relationships among mammals at the most basal level. They argued that the term mammal should be defined based on characters (especially the dentary-squamosal jaw articulation) instead of a crown-based definition (the group that contains most recent common ancestor of monotremes and therians and all of its descendants). Their definition of Mammalia is roughly equal to the Mammaliaformes as defined by McKenna and Bell (1997) and other authors. They also define their taxonomic levels as clades and do not apply Linnean hierarchies. Mammalia *‚Ä†Sinoconodon - earliest and most basal of mammals *Unnamed clade 1 - a clade that contains all other mammals. These are characterized by determinant growth and occlusal features of the cheek teeth. **‚Ä†Morganucodontidae - morganucodontids, including ‚Ä†Morganucodon, ‚Ä†Megazostrodon, and others **‚Ä†Docodonta - docodonts, including ‚Ä†Haldanodon and ‚Ä†Castorocauda (Ji et al., 2006) **Unnamed clade 2 - a clade containing all living mammals and some fossil relatives. It is characterized by the loss of a postdentary trough and a widened braincase. ***‚Ä†Hadrocodium ***‚Ä†Kuehneotherium ***Crown-group Mammalia - the group that contains most recent common ancestor of monotremes and therians and all of its descendants. This group is defined by additional characters relating the occlusion of molars and the presence of a well-developed masseteric fossa. ****Australosphenida - a clade that contains monotremes and their fossil relatives. These fossils include ‚Ä†Ambondro, ‚Ä†Asfaltomylos, ‚Ä†Ausktribosphenos, and ‚Ä†Bishops. If correct, this clade represents an independent evolution of the tribosphenic molar in southern continents. ****Trechnotheria - Therians, spalacotheriids and their relatives. They are characterized by features of the scapula, tibia, and humerus. *****‚Ä†Spalacotheriidae - including Akidolestes, Zhangheotherium, and Maotherium. *****Cladotheria - Therians, dryolestids, and their relatives. They are characterized by features of the tribosphenic molar and the angular process of the dentary. ******‚Ä†Dryolestidae ******‚Ä†Amphitherium - incertae sedis (it may be a prototribosphenidan) ******Prototribosphenida - Therians and fossil relatives including ‚Ä†Vincelestes. Characterized by features of the cochlea including coiling. *******‚Ä†Vincelestes *******Zatheria - Therians and fossil relatives including the \\"peramurids\\". Characterized by the presence of wear in the talonid of the lower molars. ********‚Ä†\\"Peramuridae\\" - ‚Ä†Peramus and relatives. Known only from preserved mandibles and distinctly zatherian molars. ********Boreosphenida - Therians and fossil relatives including ‚Ä†Kielantherium. They are characterized by molar features. *********‚Ä†Kielantherium *********‚Ä†Deltatheroida including ‚Ä†Deltatheridium - incertae sedis (it may represent a metatherian) *********Crown-group Theria - the group that contains most recent common ancestor of marsupials and placentals and all of its descendants. Characterized by a host of molar features, aspects of the alispenoid, and aspects of the astragalus region. ****‚Ä†Eutriconodonta - incertae sedis. Triconodonts appear to be a member of the crown-Mammalia clade, but their relationships within it are unknown. It is also not certain that they represent a monophyletic group. Examples include Repenomamus. ***‚Ä†Multituberculata - incertae sedis. Luo e al. (2002) argue that multituberculates cannot be confidently placed in a particular clade of mammals. They suggest that they represent either basal mammals or are sister to the Trechnotheria. ==Simplified classification for non-specialists== The following classification is a simplified version based on current understanding suitable for non-specialists who want to understand how living genera are related to each other. The classification ignores differences in levels and thus cannot be used to estimate the respective distances between taxa. It also ignores taxa that became extinct in pre-historic times. Finally, English names are preferred whenever they exist. This makes it especially suited for non-specialists who wish to gain an easy overview. For the full picture, the non-simplified versions above should be consulted. *Monotremes (prototheria): echidnas and platypus **Platypus **Echidnas (tachyglossids) *Live-bearing mammals (theria) **Marsupials ***Opossums (didelphids) ***Shrew opossums (caenolestids) ***Australodelphia: Australian marsupials and monito del Monte ****Monito del Monte ****Dasyuromorphs *****Dasyurids: antechinuses, quolls, dunnarts, Tasmanian devil, and allies *****Numbat ****Peramelemorphs: bilbies and bandicoots *****Bilbies (thylacomyids) *****Bandicoots (peramelids) ****Marsupial moles (notoryctids) ****Diprotodonts *****Koala *****Wombats (vombatids) *****Phalangerids: brushtail possums and cuscuses *****Pygmy possums (burramyids) *****Honey possum *****Petaurids: striped and Leadbeater's possums, and yellow-bellied, suger, mahogany and squirrel glider *****Ringtailed possums (pseudocheirids) *****Potorids: potoroos, rat kangaroos and bettongs *****Acrobatids: feathertail glider and feather-tailed possum *****Musky rat-kangaroo *****Macropodids: kangaroos, wallabies and allies **Placentals ***Atlantic placentals (atlantogenatans) ****Afroplacentals (afrotherians) *****Afroinsectiphilians: elephant shrews, tenrecs, otter shrews, golden moles, and aardvark ******Elephant shrews (macroscelidids) ******Afrosoricids: tenrecs and golden moles *******Tenrecids: tenrecs and otter shrews *******Golden moles (chrysochlorids) ******Aardvark *****Paenungulates: hyraxes, elephants, dugongs and manatees ******Hyraxes or dassies (procaviids) ******Elephants (elephantids) ******Sirenians: dugong and manatees *******Dugong *******Manatees (trichechids) ****Xenarthrans *****Pilosans: sloths and anteaters ******Anteaters (vermilinguans) *******Silky anteater *******Myrmecophagids: giant anteater and tamanduas ******Sloths (folivorans) *******Three-toed sloths (bradypodids) *******Two-toed sloths (megalonychids) *****Armadillos (dasypodids) ***Northern placentals (boreoeutherians) ****Supraprimates (euarchontoglires) *****Euarchontans: treeshrews, colugos and primates ******Treeshrews (scandentians) *******Tupaiids: all treeshrews except pen-tailed *******Pen-tailed treeshrew ******Colugos or flying lemurs (cynocephalids) ******Primates *******Strepsirrhines: lemur- and loris-like primates ********Lemur-like primates (lemuriforms) *********Cheirogaleids: dwarf lemurs and mouse-lemurs *********Aye-aye *********True lemurs (lemurids) *********Sportive lemurs (lepilemurids) *********Indriids: woolly lemurs and allies ********Loris-like primates (lorisiforms) *********Lorisids: lorises, pottos and allies *********Galagos (galagids) *******Haplorhines: tarsiers, monkeys and apes ********Tarsiers (tarsiids) ********Anthropoid primates *********New World monkeys (platyrrhines) **********Callitrichids: marmosets and tamarins **********Cebids: capuchins and squirrel monkeys **********Aotids: night or owl monkeys **********Pitheciids: titis, sakis and uakaris **********Atelids: howler, spider, woolly spider, and woolly monkeys *********Catarrhines **********Old World monkeys (cercopithecids) **********Hominoid primates ***********Gibbons (hylobatids) ***********Great apes (hominids): incl.

During his long and eventful reign: 1552: Russia took Kazan, 1556: Russia took Astrakhan, 1569: Turks and Crimeans failed to re-take Astrakhan, 1571: Crimean Tatars burnt Moscow, 1572: Crimeans defeated near Moscow. During his reign there were a number of Cossack raids on Crimea. Among his sons Mehmed II Giray (1577‚Äì1584), ƒ∞sl√¢m II Giray (1584‚Äì1588), ƒûazƒ± II Giray (1588‚Äì1607), Fetih I Giray (1596‚Äì1597), Sel√¢met I Giray (1608‚Äì1610), Mehmed III Giray (1610, 1623‚Äì1627), Mubarak, Adil, Alp, Sahin, Akhmed and Haji (both killed by Russians in 1555). Saadet II Giray (1584) was a son of Mehmed II. Canibek Giray (1610‚Äì1623, 1624, 1627‚Äì1635) was a son of Mubarak. His wives were: Aisha Fatima Khatun, a Circassian princess; Khansuret Khatun, daughter of Circassian Prince Kambulat Cherkasski; Khanbike Khatun; Farkhan Khatun; Jamali Khatun. ==Early Life and enthronement== He was the son of Mubarak, and grandson of Me√±li I Giray (1478‚Äì1515). From Mengli's death until Devlet's accession the throne was held by Mubarak's brothers and their sons, so Devlet was from a collateral branch. Mubarak served Sultan Selim I the Grim and died fighting in Egypt in 1516/17. In 1530 Devlet became Kalga to his uncle Saadet I Giray (1524‚Äì1532). When Saadet abdicated in 1532 he was imprisoned and then followed his uncle to Istanbul. Girays in the Turkish service were potential Crimean khans. In 1551 Sahib I Giray refused a Turkish order to fight in Persia. Devlet was sent to replace him. The Crimean army went over to Devlet, Sahib was captured and killed and by Devlet's order Sahib's children and grandchildren were also killed. ==Reign== 1552: Kazan lost: Learning that the pro-Russian Shahghali had been driven out of Kazan, in March 1552 Ivan decided on a major campaign against that Khanate. Learning of this, Devlet decided to attack Muscovy while the army was away, which would give him an easy victory and also protect Kazan. Nearing Ryazan he learned that Ivan was waiting for him at Kolomna. He planned to retreat, but his men did not want to go home without loot. He besieged Tula on 21 June, but two days an advancing Russian army and a sortie by the garrison drove the Tatars away and captured the wagons and all the Turkish artillery. In October of that year Russia conquered the Khanate of Kazan. 1556: Astrakhan lost: After the fall of Kazan Yamghurchi of Astrakhan broke with Russia and allied with Crimea. Devlet sent 13 cannon but no soldiers. In the spring of 1554 Ivan sent 33,000 soldiers down the Volga, drove out Yamgurchi and replaced him with Dervish Ali Astrakhani. Dervish then broke with Russia and allied with Crimea. Devlet sent some cannon, advisors, 300 Jannisaries and 700 Crimeans. In 1556 Russia drove out Dervish and conquered Astrakhan. Meanwhile, on the steppe Ismail was in conflict with his elder brother Yusuf Bey, the father of the unfortunate S√∂yembik√§ of Kazan. He sought support from the Turks. The Sultan turned the matter over to the Crimeans who were in charge of steppe affairs. Devlet said no and Ismail turned to Moscow. He proposed a joint attack on Astrakhan to put his prot√©g√© Dervish Ali on the throne. Ismail's horsemen were to meet Russian boats on the Volga, but he did not show up because he was away fighting his brother Yusuf. The Russians took Astrakhan without him. Ismail killed Yusuf and became head of the Nogais. Kazi-Mirza gathered those who disliked the rule of a pro-Russian fratricide and led them to the Kuban where they formed the Small Nogai Horde which was closely allied with Crimea. Wars against Russia: Around this time Russia was briefly involved in the North Caucasus. See Kabardia. In the spring of 1555 Devlet led an army to the North Caucasus to deal with some Circassians who had gone over to the Russians. Learning of this, Ivan sent 13000 men under Sheremetev and Saltykov south in the direction of Perekop. On the way they learned that Devlet had turned north intending to attack Ryazan. Ivan reinforced the Oka bank Line, Devlet retreated and bumped into Sheremetev near Sudbishchi 150km south of Tula. Sheremetev captured his supply wagons, Devlet attacked and suffered great losses, including his sons Kalga Akhmed Geray and Haji Geray. Another son, Mehmed, rushed north, defeated Sheremetev and the Crimeans returned home. Howorth (1880), p489 has the Akhmed-Haji-Mehmed story as a steppe battle against 'the famous Shermet Oghlu' (Sheremetev?) circa 1551.. In the spring of 1556 Devlet failed a third time in a raid on Muscovy. In January 1558 Devlet sent 100,000 men under his eldest son Kalga Mehmed Geray to attack Tula, Ryazan and Kashira. Learning of a Russian concentration on the Oka, they turned back. The Russians chased them as far as the river Oskol but could not catch them. In May‚ÄìJune 1562 Devlet sent 15000 men to raid around Mtsensk, Odoev, Novosil, Bolkhov Cherny and Belyov. In the spring 1563 Devlet's sons Mehmed and Adil raided around Dedilov, Pronsk and Ryazan. In October 1564 Develt and his two sons raided around Ryazan for six days. In autumn 1565 Devlet and a small army raided around Bolkhov but was driven off. After the 1569 Astrakhan campaign (below), in spring 1570 his sons Mehmed and Adil Geray devastated the area around Ryazan and Kashira. At some point, given his failures, Devlet tried to make peace with Moscow, but his nobles refused. Cossacks against Crimea: About this time Dmytro Vyshnevetsky was turning the Zaporozhian Cossacks into a serious fighting force. In 1556 Devlet led his army toward the Circassia, but turned back when he learned that pro-Russian Cossacks were descending the Dnieper and Don. The Cossacks wrecked Islyam-Kerman/Kakhovka, and carried its cannon back to Khortytsia. They attacked Ak-Chum/Ochakov and Kerch, but on the approach of Devlet's army they slipped away. In the spring of 1557 Devlet besieged Vishnevetsky and the Zaporozhian Cossacks Khortytsia. After 24 days he was forced to retreat. In 1558 Vishnevetsky, Zaporozhian Cossacks and 5000 Russian soldiers went on ships to the lower Don, raided deep into Crimean territories, besieged Azak/Azov and defeated a Crimean force. At the same time 8000 Russians under Adashev went down the Dnieper and raided the west coast of Crimea, looted villages and freed many captives from Russia and Lithuania. The Turks they captured were freed since they were not at war with the sultan. Circassians invaded Crimea across the Kerch strait, but Devlet defeated them and seized their leaders. Around this time Ismail tried several times to break through Perekop. Many of the mainland Nogais fled to Crimea or joined Ismail. There was also drought with hunger and plague. Pressure was relieved when Vishnevetsky broke with Ivan and Ivan turned to the Livonian War (1558‚Äì1563). 1569: Turks fail to take Astrakhan: As early as 1563 the Turks developed a grandiose plan to recapture Astrakhan from the infidels, reopen the trade and pilgrim route north of the Caspian and dig a canal from the Don to the Volga to send ships from the Black to the Caspian Sea and attack Persia from the Caspian. Devlet was not happy with the idea of being surrounded by Turkish territory and did what he could to dissuade the sultan. There are suggestions that he interfered with the campaign even while he was on it. On 31 May 1569 Kasim-Pasha set out for Astrakhan with 15000 Janissaries, several thousand other Turks, and 30000 laborers to dig the canal. He was joined by 40 or 50 thousand of Devlet's men. They went up the Don to the point where the rivers are closest and started digging. It quickly became obvious that the canal was impossible and there was no way to haul the boats and artillery across the steppe. The artillery was sent back downriver. Kasim planned to leave but heard that he could get ships on the Volga, so he crossed the steppe and went down to Astrakhan. The town was easy, but there was no way to take the fort without cannon. There was talk of waiting for re-supply in the spring, but they had only 40 days of supply and the soldiers became mutinous at the thought of spending the winter in tents on the steppe. On 26 September Kasim lifted the siege and headed west. They were harassed by Circassians and a Russian army sent south. The mounted Crimeans and Nogais did fairly well but the soldiers suffered greatly on the waterless steppe. Much of the fleet was wrecked by a storm at Azov. See Russo-Turkish War (1568‚Äì1570). 1571: Moscow burned: Given his previous failures along the Oka, in the spring of 1571 Devlet led 40000 men north to attack Kozelsk and Bolkhov south of the western Oka Bank Line. Approaching Muscovy he met six boyars who had fled Ivan the Terrible's increasing madness. They promised to show the Tatars an unguarded area along the Oka. They said that most of the Russian army was away in Livonia and the country was weakened by crop failure and plague. When Devlet crossed the Oka Ivan fled to Rostov. By 24 May Devlet was near Moscow directing raiding parties. Moscow caught fire, a strong wind blew up and within a few hours the wooden city was in ashes except for the Kremlin walls. People who fled the fire were captured. Devlet returned to Crimea, taking more captives along the way. It is said that tens of thousands of Russians were killed and 150 thousand enslaved. See Fire of Moscow (1571). 1572: Failure near Moscow: There was talk of taking diplomatic advantage of the unexpected victory, but Devlet decided on a knock-out blow. By 5 August he had 120 thousand menGaivoronsky, p.279 on the Oka ‚Äì 80 thousand Crimeans and Nogais, 33 thousand Turks and 7000 janissaries. A Nogai detachment crossed the river and the rest of the army followed. Ivan fled towards Novgorod. The troops on the Oka went after Devlet, blocking his retreat. Devlet told his men to ignore them and concentrate on catching Ivan. His sons Mehmed and Adil disobeyed, attacked the Russians and were defeated. Devlet sent 10000 Nogai against the Russians but they fell under artillery fire. Devlet broke off the pursuit and turned his large army to block the advancing Russians. The Russians broke into groups and surrounded each group with gulyay-gorods. The first battle was about even, but the Russians captured Deve-Bey, the leader of the Nogais. Baki-Bey? Devlet planned to surround the gulay-gorods and starve them out, but the leaderless Nogais demanded immediate action. Devlet had to agree. The decisive battle took place on 11 August. When the cavalry attacked the gulay- gorods their walls were dropped revealing artillery and musketeers. The Tatars fell back and were caught by a Russian troop that had slipped behind them. The losses were worse than the previous day and Devlet lost a son and grandson. While this was going on the Tatars captured a message from Ivan saying that he was arriving with a large force. The message was a trick, Devlet fell for it and retreated, having lost a large part of his army. Estimates of the survivors range from 5 to 20 thousand. See Battle of Molodi. Later: In subsequent years there were small raids on Muscovy by his sons and various Crimean and Nogai mirzas. As he grew older there were difficult relations between his sons Mehmed and Adil. He died of plague on 29 June 1577 and was buried at Bakhchisarai. He was followed by his oldest son Mehmed II Geray (1577‚Äì1584). ==His sons== Devlet was the ancestor of all subsequent khans.

Several large islands are partially or wholly embedded in the ice shelf, pinning the calving front. Summer temperature and salinity measurements from 1994 to 2010 show the shelf is subject to more changeable oceanic forcing than other Antarctic shelves. Beneath cold surface waters, the thermocline was ‚àº200 m shallower in 2007 than in 2000, indicative of shifting access of deep water to the continental shelf and ice shelf base. The calculated area-average basal melt rates was between 1.1 and 4.1 m of ice per year, making Getz the largest source of meltwater to the Southern Ocean. The ice shelf westward of Siple Island was discovered by the United States Antarctic Service (USAS) in December 1940. The portion eastward of Siple Island was first delineated from air photos taken by U.S. Navy Operation Highjump, 1946‚Äì47. The entire feature was mapped by the United States Geological Survey from U.S. Navy air photos of 1962‚Äì65. It was named by the USAS (1939‚Äì41) for George F.

Its towers were located in St. Clairsville, Ohio. It is West Virginia's only class A 50,000-watt clear-channel station, sharing the frequency's Class A status with KFAQ (formerly KVOO) in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and KJNP in North Pole, Alaska. WWVA can be heard in most of the eastern two-thirds of the United States at night, as well as most of Canada. The station is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. and uses the on-air nickname \\"The Big One\\" (borrowed from sister stations WLW and WTAM). WWVA was one of the first stations in the U.S. to have an in-studio Citizens band radio to talk to listeners at night, in between songs and other on-air items, during the 1970s when it produced and ran an in-house nightly truckers' show hosted by the popular radio personality, Buddy Ray. Ray left the station in the early 1980s. In two instances has WWVA been threatened with relocation, neither being successful: first in 1930 to Charleston by then- owner West Virginia Broadcasting Corporation, and again in 2004 to Stow, Ohio (a suburb of Akron) by then-Clear Channel Communications. ==History== former logo WWVA began broadcasting at 2 a.m. on December 13, 1926 when John Stroebel threw the switch that sent power to a home-built 50-watt transmitter in the basement of his home. One week earlier, the Federal Radio Commission had granted a broadcast license on 860 kHz to the radio station WWVA. In its first year of operation, it broadcast to listeners with home-made crystal sets, principally from Stroebel's own home. Transmitter c.1940s Through the years, WWVA has been granted several power increases. In May 1941, the FCC moved WWVA to 1170, and in August of that same year, granted it the highest power for AM stations: 50,000 watts. With the increase, WWVA became the most powerful AM station in the entire state of West Virginia. WWVA has changed hands many times over the years. Past owners include Fidelity Investments, West Virginia Broadcasting Corporation, Storer Broadcasting, Basic Communications, Screen Gems Radio - a division of Columbia Pictures, Coca-Cola, Price Broadcasting, Osborn Communications, Atlantic Star Communications, AMFM Inc., and Clear Channel Communications. It is currently owned by iHeartMedia. WWVA‚Äôs broadcast history includes the airing of such notable live broadcasts as President Dwight D. Eisenhower‚Äôs 1952 visit to the Wheeling area. In the 1980s, WWVA briefly enjoyed a reputation as one of the leading radio news operations in the country, and won several national news reporting awards under the leadership of prominent broadcast journalists such as Jim Forsyth and Colleen Marshall, but that reputation faded in the 1990s. Harvey, however, remained on the station's schedule, as did the legendary Jamboree USA and Jamboree in the Hills broadcasts. The WWVA Jamboree broadcasts started on January 7, 1933 and were even transmitted to troops abroad during World War II. Under Basic Communications ownership, the Jamboree became the centerpiece of an all- contemporary country western format starting on November 8, 1965, a format that saw ratings skyrocket weeks after it debuted. \\"This is WWVA, the big country\\" was their signature. In 1970 the studios and the Jamboree moved to the Capitol Music Hall, a civic center that is the largest in West Virginia. This country music format lasted until 1997, when WWVA abandoned it in favor of news/talk. Assumption of ownership by Clear Channel Communications resulted in the addition of such hosts as Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck. A series of cost-cutting moves in January 2004 resulted in the elimination of both local talk hosts (George Kellas and Jim Harrington) and most of the news department. Coinciding with this was an attempt to relocate the station to Stow, Ohio, under an FCC major construction permit four weeks later. This application was withdrawn in August 2004. Since then, much of WWVA's programming emulates regional sister station WHLO in Akron, Ohio. One local link to the station's past was the afternoon drive show hosted by former sportscaster Steve Novotney, but he was also fired from WWVA in November 2006. At the time, the only local talk show remaining on WWVA was Saturday Sports Day with John Simonson, but WWVA, then in negotiations with new ownership, made a bold move when they paid more money to David Bloomquist to export his Bloomdaddy Experience from rival local station, WKKX in late May/early June 2007. The move was controversial (even though the reason given by WKKX to let Bloomquist go was in connection with the Don Imus Rutgers controversy that transpired on MSNBC around that same time), as WKKX members appeared bitter about the exit. Clear Channel began to syndicate Bloomdaddy through the northeast and midwest after the cancellation of The War Room with Quinn and Rose in November 2013. The Original Wheeling Radio Jamboree (formerly Jamboree USA) is the second- longest running program in radio history (The Grand Ole Opry on WSM Nashville is the oldest, having first aired in 1925). However the Jamboree was dropped from WWVA's schedule in December 2008, and went to WKKX for a time. In 2015 it was picked up by community station WWOV-LP/101.1. On August 4, 2010, a severe thunderstorm, classified as a \\"down burst\\" by the National Weather Service, pushed through the Wheeling area knocking the 3-tower array, located in nearby St. Clairsville, Ohio, to the ground. The station was knocked completely off the air and took its programming to sister station WBBD on August 5. On August 5, 2010 at 10:30 pm, transmissions on 1170 AM were restored using temporary equipment. On November 16, 2006, WWVA, WOVK, WVKF, WKWK, WEGW and WBBD were announced for sale as part of Clear Channel's divestiture of almost 450 small and middle-market radio properties in the U.S. The Clear Channel Wheeling stations were initially slated to be sold to Florida-based GoodRadio.TV LLC in May 2007, but the deal soon collapsed prior to FCC approval. Prior to 2009, unlike most Clear Channel news talk stations, WWVA did not air the overnight network program Coast to Coast AM. Instead, it aired America's Trucking Network - still listed as The Truckin' Bozo on the schedule, even several years after the show's name change. The trucking show had been a longtime staple of WWVA's nighttime schedule. WWVA was one of the first and last stations to syndicate The Truckin' Bozo, and even before that, Buddy Ray hosted a longtime truck show on the station. The trucking programming was unceremoniously dropped in 2009, replaced with Coast to Coast AM, already available from the many other AM signals that penetrate the area. ==Programming== WWVA airs a local morning show hosted by David Blomquist (\\"Bloomdaddy\\"), which is simulcast on WJAS in Pittsburgh. The remainder of WWVA's weekday programming is identical to that of most iHeartMedia news talk stations, carrying Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and George Noory. WWVA produces a local agricultural education program (\\"Extension Calling\\") recorded by OSU and WVU Extension Agents, aired Sunday mornings for over 40 years. The station broadcasts paid programming in the late nights. Its signal can be picked up quite strongly as far away as Toronto, Ontario, Canada, giving Toronto the ability to hear programs which are not permitted to air locally due to Canadian content regulations. WWVA relies on a fairly large amount of paid and religious programming during the evening and weekend hours. It is one of a handful of 50,000-watt AM stations that still engage in this practice, including WCKY in Cincinnati, Ohio and KXEL in Waterloo, Iowa. ==References== ==External links== *NewsRadio 1170 WWVA *In-house history of WWVA published on the station's 50th anniversary *Arcane Radio Trivia - The Newcomer twins of WWVA *Pictures of WWVA's Towers Down *map of WWVA-AM (Wikimapia) WVA (AM) Category:Radio stations established in 1926 Category:IHeartMedia radio stations Category:News and talk radio stations in the United States Category:1926 establishments in West Virginia ","title":"WWVA (AM)"},{"id":"1436492","text":"The Japan Network Information Center (JPNIC) is the National Internet Registry in Japan that manages several aspects of Internet operations, including the allocation of IP addresses and AS numbers.

He also acted as acting captain of Pakistan against West Indies in Sharjah.ODI statistics for Aamer Sohail at CricketOnly === Controversies === Sohail played a big role in Pakistan's World-Cup triumph in 1992, famously telling Ian Botham that he might want to send his mother-in-law in to bat, referring to Botham's statement that he wouldn't send even his mother-in-law to Pakistan, after Botham was controversially given out for nought in the final. In the 1996 World Cup Quarter Final in Bangalore against arch rival India, Sohail was captaining his side in pursuit of a relatively large target of 287 in 49 overs. With opening partner Saeed Anwar, he got Pakistan off to a flying start. With the score at 109 for one, and Saeed Anwar (48) back in the pavilion, Sohail smashed a delivery from Indian seamer Venkatesh Prasad through the covers for four. Both players exchanged words, and Sohail unnecessarily pointed his finger aggressively at Prasad. The next delivery clean-bowled him and triggered a batting collapse which ultimately lost the game and eliminated Pakistan from the competition. Sohail was at the heart of the match-fixing scandal that rocked cricket in the 1990s: as captain of the national team, his whistle-blowing may have negatively affected his international career.Aamer Sohail ESPNcricinfo profile ==Cricket administration== After retiring from cricket in 2001, Sohail became chief selector for the national team, his tenure ending in January 2004 when he was replaced by former national team wicketkeeper Wasim Bari.

One-time or limited-time retro uniforms are sometimes produced to be worn by teams in games, on special occasions such as anniversaries of significant events. Throwback uniforms have proven popular in all major pro and college sports in North America, not only with fans, but with the teams' merchandising departments. Because the \\"authentic\\" uniforms (accurate reproductions) and less-authentic \\"replicas\\" had been so popular at retail, the professional leagues institutionalized throwbacks as \\"third jerseys\\". == Background == Throwbacks were first popularized in Major League Baseball, where teams not only wore renditions of their past styles, but also tributes to defunct minor league and Negro League baseball teams as well. Often, the games where teams will wear throwbacks are promoted as \\"Turn Back The Clock Nights\\". Throwbacks also make frequent appearances every season in college football games, National Hockey League games, and in National Basketball Association games. The first companies to produce throwback uniforms were Tiedman & Company Sportswear (college football, basketball, hockey, NFL and World Cup soccer), Mitchell & Ness (Major League Baseball), and Ebbets Field Flannels (Negro League baseball). All three companies are still in business; Tiedman & Company relaunched in 2009 under the brand name Tiedman & Formby Vintage Athletic Co. In some instances, teams will wear \\"fauxbacks\\": retro designed uniforms harkening back to an era which pre-dates the team itself. For example, the Tampa Bay Rays, formed in 1998, wore 1979-style baseball uniforms in 2012 (although they have used Tampa Tarpons and Tampa Smokers throwback jerseys), and the Dallas Mavericks have used a 1970s-like basketball uniform since 2004, despite having been established in 1980. Fauxback can also refer to a retro style \\"vintage inspired\\" uniform that has design elements from a uniform from the past but is in itself a completely new and different design due to cosmetic adjustments. An example of this is the current Buffalo Bills NFL team uniforms that feature helmets resembling the team's white helmets from the 1970s but with a different, more modern looking stripe design. == American football == === National Football League === Throwbacks were introduced in the NFL in 1991 at retail through the NFL Throwbacks Collection. The rights to produce the vintage apparel was limited to six apparel licensees, including Tiedman & Company Sportswear (exclusive to jerseys), Riddell (helmets), Starter (caps), Nutmeg Mills (sweatshirts), and DeLong (jackets). In 1994, to honor the NFL's 75th Anniversary, teams were allowed to wear modern versions of their old uniform styles. However, the designs varied widely in their accuracy: * While no attempt was made to simulate obsolete leather helmets which were phased out in the 1950s, teams simulating uniforms from the era of leather headgear simply removed all decals and striping from their regular hard-shell helmets. * A rule imposed by the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger in 1970 adopted the AFL's policy of all jerseys displaying the player's last name on the back side. This practice was not part of the NFL officially until after the merger, but in order to keep consistency with current rules, the names were placed on the back side of all throwback jerseys. * In most instances the fonts and typestyles used were only approximate matches at best. * The Arizona Cardinals, Chicago Bears and Pittsburgh Steelers wore reproductions of uniforms that pre-dated large numerals on the front of jerseys, so instead smaller numerals were worn on the right shoulder. * The Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills received some criticism for their portrayal of their throwbacks. The Cowboys wore their early 1960s uniforms with their current helmet, while the Bills wore their then-current uniforms with the old \\"standing buffalo\\" logo in white on their red helmets, in place of the current blue \\"charging buffalo\\" logo. Later that season, the Cowboys used the \\"double-star\\" uniform, which could be considered an updated version of the 1960s jerseys. Ironically, both teams have since adopted these throwbacks more accurately as alternates, with Dallas now using the original, plain star helmet and Buffalo using the original red \\"standing buffalo\\" helmet on white background, as well as wearing the AFL-era jerseys as opposed to the Jim Kelly/Marv Levy-era jerseys (the two jerseys have few noticeable differences other than sleeve stripes, which were present on the 1960s jerseys but not on the 1990s ones). The Bills adopted 1975-era throwbacks, with white helmets, as their main uniform in 2011. The New York Jets also received similar criticism for using their throwback logo on their then-current green helmets; when they adopted the throwback design full-time in 1998, they also went back to their original-style white helmets. The Bills and Cowboys did the same when they adopted their retro unis. * The Miami Dolphins, New Orleans Saints, Seattle Seahawks, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Indianapolis Colts and Cleveland Browns had not had major uniform redesigns up to that point or only made subtle changes, as the Seahawks and Buccaneers had joined the league just 18 years earlier. The Seahawks and Buccaneers have also since redesigned their uniforms in 2002, 2012 and 1997, 2014 respectively, while the Dolphins made some minor updates in 1997, then a brand new look altogether in 2013, the Saints got new uniforms in 2000, and also the Browns in 2015. Champ Bailey wearing a Denver Broncos throwback uniform in 2009 All the teams were informed that they would be wearing the Throwbacks during Week Three of the season. Some teams continued to wear theirs throughout the season. The San Francisco 49ers wore replicas of their 1955 uniforms in their Super Bowl XXIX victory. The uniforms were well-liked enough that the 49ers brought them back, in slightly modified form, for 1996‚Äì1997. In 1998, the gold pants from before were returned, in more modern form. In 2009, the team debuted an updated design of the 1980s uniforms that won them four of their five Super Bowls. Both of the NFL's New York City teams' throwbacks proved so popular with their fans that the teams returned to wearing them full-time soon afterwards: The Jets' replicas of their 1968 uniforms (with a darker shade of green than before), and the Giants' 1961 uniforms, with the lowercase \\"ny\\" instead of the underlined uppercase \\"GIANTS\\" ‚Äì which was retained as a secondary logo ‚Äì imposed after moving to East Rutherford, New Jersey. Both teams have modernized the 1960s decals for their current primary corporate logos. As a result of the NFL modifying its rules to allow teams to wear alternate jerseys in 2002, throwbacks still make occasional appearances. The Thanksgiving Day games hosted by the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys have been a showcase of throwbacks in recent years. The Bills, San Diego Chargers and Cowboys traditionally wear their early 1960s throwbacks twice each season. Additionally, the Lions dropped their much criticized black alternates in favor of the popular 1940's and 1950s throwbacks (plain blue jersey, silver pants and helmets) in 2008. However; due to the NFL's regulations about player safety and helmets both teams have ceased wearing the throwback uniforms. The Lions in 2011 and Cowboys in 2013. The Cleveland Browns throwbacks are based on a uniform/helmet combination that first appeared in 1957 when Jim Brown was drafted. (Player numbers appeared on the side of the helmet that year.) The Browns began wearing their throwbacks in 2006 as part of the team's 60th Anniversary. They only wear them once per season. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who substantially changed their uniforms and team colors in 1997, never wore their orange throwbacks from 1997 to 2008. In 2009, the team wore their throwbacks for the first time against the Packers on November 8 to debut the \\"Buccaneers' Ring of Honor.\\" The club has continued to do so annually until 2014. The San Diego Chargers wore their 1960s style powder-blue uniforms with white helmets as alternates from 2002 to 2006 and in 2007 adopted a modified version as their full-time uniforms. Meanwhile, the San Francisco 49ers wore their 1980s-style home red uniforms as throwbacks in 2002 (in 2005 the team re-designated them as alternate uniforms to be worn 1‚Äì2 home games a season). The team also petitioned the league to wear the throwbacks on the 2007 season opening night, as a tribute to their late former head coach Bill Walsh. For the 2009 season, an updated design based heavily on the 1980s throwbacks was debuted by the 49ers, which was combined with the team's current modern logo. On September 16, 2007, the Pittsburgh Steelers, celebrating their 75th season, wore a variation of their older early '60s uniforms that featured gold helmets with black stripe, black jerseys with gold numbers and stripes, and white pants with black-and-gold side stripes as they hosted Buffalo. They wore them again on Monday Night Football on November 5 against Baltimore. The Steelers enjoyed immense success in both games, winning each handily (26‚Äì3 vs. Buffalo, 38‚Äì7 vs. Baltimore), in direct contrast to the team's struggles when they wore those jerseys originally. On November 11, 2007, The New York Giants, wore their red uniforms against the division rival Dallas Cowboys. Also in 2007, the New York Jets twice wore replicas of their New York Titans uniforms ‚Äì once against the Philadelphia Eagles, and once against the Miami Dolphins. Since then, the Jets have worn the Titans uniforms several more times ‚Äì twice in 2008, three times in 2009, and once in 2011. For two of the 2009 games, the Jets wore white versions, replicating the Titans road uniforms. The Eagles wore their powder blue and yellow throwback jerseys during the home game against the Lions on September 23, 2007. Though the Eagles had a big 56‚Äì21 victory, these particular Throwbacks were criticised as being very unattractive. During Sunday Night Football on NBC that week, Keith Olbermann named the Philadelphia Eagles the \\"Worst Persons in the NFL\\" for their blue- and-yellow throwback jerseys, citing \\"Throwbacks? Try throw-ups!\\" The blue and yellow uniforms, which are the same colors as the flag of the City of Philadelphia, were used by the Eagles, and their predecessors, the defunct Frankford Yellowjackets franchise, until the 1940s when the more familiar pre- Jeffrey Lurie era kelly green was introduced. The kelly green throwbacks from the 1960 season were wore for the 2010 season opener vs. the Green Bay Packers to commemorate the 50th anniversary of when the Eagles beat the Packers to win the 1960 NFL Championship. For the 2009 season, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the American Football League, the eight charter members of the AFL wore throwback uniforms from the early 1960s on select \\"Legacy Weekends.\\" The Dallas Cowboys, also celebrating their 50th anniversary season, wore throwback jerseys for some games. The Packers, starting in 2010, introduced their 1929 throwback uniforms as their alternative uniform. Honoring the Packers first ever championship team in 1929, the uniform features a navy blue jersey with yellow numbers, with an added twist, as the uniforms in 1929 featured a small yellow circle in the front with a blue number in it. The circle and numbers were enlarged to meet current NFL uniform rules. Complementing the rest of the uniform were tan pants, replicating the canvas uniform pants used during the 1920s. The team switched to their 1940s uniforms for the 2015 season, which removed the yellow circle but retained the color scheme. In their 80th anniversary, the Pittsburgh Steelers released a throwback uniform that honored the 1934 team. The uniform was a gold and black horizontal-striped jersey white squares containing the numbers.Pittsburgh Steelers 80th Anniversary Throwback Jerseys: You Be the Judge by Andrea Hangst, 17 Apr 2012 The throwback uniform was worn twice during the regular season. and drew major media attention. USA Today said that the Steelers looked like \\"bumblebee[s] in a Depression-era chain gang.\\" The NFL imposed a new rule for the 2013 season prohibiting the use of alternate colored helmets, eliminating many of the historically accurate throwback uniforms that had been in use up to that point. Teams are still allowed to use alternate decals (or no decals at all) for their throwbacks, but they must use them on the regular helmets.Breech, John (September 17, 2013).

The uniforms resembled those of the 1939 Tigers, Clemson's first bowl team. In a continuation of the centennial celebration, the uniforms were also worn for one game the following season, a September 7, 1996 contest against Furman. The Texas Longhorns college football team wore throwback uniforms for a single game during their 2005 national championship season as a way of honoring the past. The throwback jerseys were similar to jerseys worn during their 1963 National Championship season under Coach Darrell K Royal. The University of Virginia football team wore throwback uniforms in a single game on September 6, 2008, in honor of Virginia's teams from 1984 through 1993. The university's athletic department termed the game a \\"Retro Game\\" instead of using the term \\"throwback.\\" The University of Virginia football team also wore throwback uniforms in a single game on September 29, 2012, in honor of Virginia's 1968 team and Frank Quayle. The University of Florida football team wore throwback uniforms in a single game on September 30, 2006, in honor of Florida's teams in the 1960s. For the 2009 and 2010 seasons, as part of Nike's Pro Combat program, several college football teams, including Ohio State and Oregon State wore throwback-inspired uniforms. In addition, for the 2009 playing of the \\"Holy War\\" rivalry against the University of Utah Utes (and also in the Las Vegas Bowl), the BYU Cougars donned royal blue throwback uniforms to commemorate the 25th anniversary of their 1984 National Championship season. These throwbacks, along with another alternate royal blue uniform, have been employed occasionally in subsequent seasons; since in 2014, they have been worn for the team's homecoming game each year. The Kansas Jayhawks football team wore throwback uniforms on October 1, 2011 to honor the 50th anniversary of the 1961 KU football team, winners of the 1961 Bluebonnet Bowl, the program's first-ever bowl victory.UniformCritics.com, Photos of 2011 Kansas Jayhawks Throwback Uniform.

In 2005‚Äì06 Arsenal changed their home colours from their traditional red and white to a variant of maroon known as redcurrant as a commemoration of their final season at Highbury Stadium; this colour was supposedly the same shade the team had worn when they first played at Highbury in 1913, although later evidence suggested that Arsenal's main colour at that time was a more standard shade known as 'Garibaldi red'. Redcurrant, however, still played a part in their kits since; most recently on their yellow change kit featuring redcurrant shorts and pinstripes on the shirt and socks, between 2010 and 2012. Paul Scholes and Owen Hargreaves in 2008, wearing 1958-style Manchester United kits to mark the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster Manchester United wore several retro-style kits in the 1990s and 2000s, based on kits the worn by the club in the 1950s and '60s, as well as that worn by their first ever team, known then as Newton Heath. The Newton Heath-inspired kit was introduced in 1992 and worn for two seasons as a third kit. They wore a replica of their jersey from 1958 during the Manchester derby against Manchester City on February 10, 2008 at Old Trafford to mark the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster four days earlier. United were granted special dispensation by the Premier League to wear the one-off uniform which was devoid of logos and kit markings, and used the traditional \\"one to eleven\\" numbering scheme rather than using squad numbers. In a gesture of solidarity, Manchester City similarly removed the sponsor and manufacturer logos from their kits for the game, giving their shirts the same clean and empty look resembling the plain shirts of the 1950s when logos and team badges were not worn. However, they used the current season's kit style and chose not to go the whole distance in producing a retro-looking kit; retaining the club crest, competition sleeve patches, and the player name and squad number on the kit but added a black ribbon above the right breast. The previous season, 2006‚Äì07, United introduced a similar 1950s-style uniform to celebrate 50 years of the Busby Babes' first league championship. After their Champions League victory in 2008, United introduced another retro-style kit for 2008‚Äì09, celebrating the 40th anniversary of their first European Cup win. The club unveiled an all-blue third kit, based on the one worn against Benfica in the 1968 final. More authentic reproductions of kits from the past have become popular fashion items, especially jerseys linked to successful or memorable teams. When France won the 1998 World Cup, their uniform was reminiscent of the design of the triumphant Euro 1984 team, with a red horizontal stripe and three thin horizontal stripes across the chest. When the United States men's soccer team took the field between 1999 and 2001, their plain white uniform with a thick V-neck collar looked reminiscent of the U.S. Soccer Federation's first uniform worn in 1916. A similar uniform was produced in 2013, complete with vintage crest, to mark the 100th anniversary of the USSF. For the FIFA Centenary Match in 2004, France and Brazil played in kits resembling their first ever home kits. The Brazilian team wore white tops with blue trim, the original colours of their home kit, which was replaced in 1951 by today's yellow top with green trim after the 1950 World Cup defeat. Tottenham Hotspur celebrated their 125th anniversary during the 2007‚Äì08 season by launching a special kit in the club's early colours, sky blue and white, which were originally worn in 1885. The kit was worn for one game only, a 4‚Äì4 home draw to Aston Villa. For the 2009‚Äì10 Premier League, newly promoted Burnley wore a redesigned version of their 1959‚Äì60 Football League kits, when they last won the then-First Division. Southampton celebrated the club's 125th anniversary in 2010‚Äì11, by wearing the strip worn by the team's original forebears, which consisted of a white shirt with a red sash, white shorts and black socks. During the later stages of the 2011‚Äì12 season, financially troubled Scottish club Rangers wore their normal blue shirts on the pitch, but began selling and encouraging fans to wear throwback red and black striped scarves, the traditional colours of the burgh of Govan (where Ibrox Stadium is located) in an attempt to raise money. The club would be placed in administration, face liquidation and then sold to a new ownership group, with a severe relegation penalty for the 2012‚Äì13 season. English club West Bromwich Albion wore a replica of their 1968 FA Cup Final kit, in their Premier League game against Leicester City on 11 April 2015. It was worn to honour the match-winning goalscorer in the 1968 Cup Final, Jeff Astle, who died in 2002 due to chronic traumatic encephalopathy as a result of heading the heavy leather footballs through his career. The kit used the 1‚Äì11 numbering system save for the goalkeeper's shirt, which was left blank as they were in those days. 2014‚Äì15 Scottish Championship winners Heart of Midlothian F.C. chose for their current season a replica of the shirt worn by the team 100 years ago, for the 1914‚Äì15 season. The shirt is plain maroon with a white collar and fly-button opening and has no sponsorship logos. Though the 1914‚Äì15 shirt bore no badge, the current shirt has an embroidered badge in the style of the club's logo of one hundred years ago. The shirt and badge also commemorate Hearts first and reserve teams, management and fans who, though currently topping the Scottish league, volunteered for the Great War effort en-masse in November 1914 to join a newly forming wartime volunteer infantry battalion, 16th Battalion Royal Scots, commanded by George McCrae (politician) MP. Spurred on by Hearts, \\"McCrae's Battalion\\" also attracted players and supporters from other Scottish teams plus various sportsmen. The first football team to join up, Hearts and \\"McCrae's Battalion\\" were mentioned in thanks by Winston Churchill in Parliament and proved a catalyst in the formation of other football and sportsmen battalions of Kitchener's Army. Heart of Midlothian lost 7 players killed in the war, plus others maimed or gassed and unable to resume their careers after the war. For the 2019 Copa Am√©rica, the Brazil national team released a 100th. anniversary shirt, in white with blue details. It resembled the shirt worn in the first official match v Exeter City in 1919. The white uniform would be last worn in the 1950 FIFA World Cup 'final' that Brazil lost to Uruguay at Estadio Maracan√°. The retro kit debuted in the first match v Bolivia. == Australian rules football == 's heritage guernsey. Throwback uniforms, more commonly called heritage guernseys, are worn occasionally by clubs in the Australian Football League, mostly to commemorate the anniversaries of past successes or events. Between 2003 and 2007, there was an annual \\"Heritage Round\\", in which all clubs were encouraged to wear heritage guernseys from either their club or state. The heritage guernsey of the Port Adelaide Football Club has been a regular source of controversy. The primary historical guernsey of the Port Adelaide Football Club, when it dominated national football the years before World War I and the South Australian National Football League for the 19th century, was black with a white \\"prison bars\\" design; however, when the club entered the Australia Football League in 1997, it was forced to change its colours to avoid a clash with the Collingwood Football Club, who also wear black and white although in a different design. Whether or not Port Adelaide is permitted to wear its black and white guernsey in any heritage matches, even those not played against Collingwood, has been a point of contention between the clubs. The most recent instance of the club wearing the guernsey was during the Elimination Final of the 2014 AFL season. == Baseball == === Major League Baseball === In 1990, the Chicago White Sox wore replicas of their 1917 World Series uniforms against the Milwaukee Brewers as part of the White Sox celebration of the final season at Comiskey Park. During the game, the scoreboard and public address system were turned off, and the lineups announced with a hand-held megaphone. Since then, these games have proven popular not only among team fans but also with viewers of TV highlight shows. ESPN, for the highlights of the 1990 game, sped up the highlights and showed them in black and white to emulate the silent film of the era. The team then adopted a modified version of the 1959 \\"Go-Go Sox\\" era jerseys for the first year at the new Comiskey Park in 1991, having kept that design since and winning the 2005 World Series in that design, ending an 88-year World Series championship drought. With the introduction of interleague play, when the Atlanta Braves played the Boston Red Sox for the first time in a regular season game in Boston in 1997, the teams wore uniforms that traced back to the initial season in which each team adopted the current nickname, the Braves wearing road uniforms from the 1912 season with the word 'BOSTON' and the Red Sox wearing 1908 uniforms with a large red sock with the word 'BOSTON' in white on the sock. It was the Braves' first official game against the Red Sox since the team moved to Milwaukee after the 1952 season. Braves manager Bobby Cox went on record as being firmly against his team being identified as 'Boston' by their uniforms. Some throwback nights featured the Oakland Athletics wearing one combo or another of the gold/white/green uniform set it featured in the 1970s and 1980s, or the Pittsburgh Pirates' black-and-gold combo from the same era ‚Äì on June 26, 2010, they did so against one another, with Pittsburgh in black and Oakland in gold. In 2003 the St. Louis Cardinals hosted the Baltimore Orioles with teams wearing retro St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Browns (the predecessor to today's Orioles, which moved to Baltimore for 1954) uniforms, respectively. The scoreboard that day said \\"Browns\\" and the stadium announcer played along with the fantasy as well. Also in 2003, in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the first modern World Series, the two participants in that game (the Boston Red Sox and the Pittsburgh Pirates) met in a 3-game interleague series at PNC Park in Pittsburgh. While the Red Sox took two of three of those games with both teams wearing their standard uniforms, the one the Pirates won was meant to replicate their matchup in the 1903 World Series with both teams wearing 1903-era throwbacks. Although baseball teams did not have uniform numbers at the time, to keep with the current rules numbers were put on the backs of the otherwise-accurate throwbacks. The JumboTron screen was left with a static background, and the scoreboard had the different team names at the time: the \\"Boston Americans\\" and the \\"Pittsburg Pirates\\". The stadium crew at PNC Park also did other 1903-era activities such as using a megaphone for announcements. In 2006 the New York Mets, in honor of the 20th anniversary of the 1986 World Series, held a \\"turn-back-the-clock-night\\" and wore their 1986 uniforms. In 2009 the Mets played three games of a four-game set against the San Francisco Giants in a \\"fauxback\\" jersey based on early 20th century New York Giants' jerseys with a giant \\"NY\\" on the chest, but using the Mets' current team colors of orange and blue. (The Mets are the only team to have worn a throwback from their home city's past instead of their franchise's past; while the Minnesota Twins and Texas Rangers, both of whom were once the Washington Senators, have each used throwbacks from their previous hometown, the city's current team, the Washington Nationals, have worn both Twins-Senators and Rangers-Senators throwbacks as well.) In 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies adopted an alternate uniform based on their 1948 uniforms, but with modern graphics on an off-white color background. Aaron Miles in a throwback Los Angeles Dodgers uniform, June 2011 Not all throwbacks use Major League uniforms; at least 15 MLB teams have at some point paid tribute to the pre-integration Negro Leagues by wearing the uniform of a Negro League from the city's past; in almost every case both teams do so simultaneously. Since the Homestead Grays played \\"home\\" games in both Washington and Pittsburgh, the team has been honored as such by both the Nationals and Pirates; in 2008 the two teams did so together, with Washington wearing the Grays' home uniforms and Pittsburgh the away ones. The Tampa Bay Rays have staged a \\"Turn Back the Clock\\" promotion with a retro theme and throwback uniforms almost every season of their existence. Because the franchise does not yet have a long history from which to choose uniforms, they have often worn the uniforms of historical local teams such as the Tampa Tarpons of the Florida State League (worn in 1999, 2006, and 2010), the St. Petersburg Pelicans of the Senior Professional Baseball Association (worn in 2008), the St. Petersburg Saints (2007) and Tampa Smokers (2011) of the Florida International League, and the University of Tampa Spartans (2000). The Rays have worn their own uniforms for Turn Back the Clock night only once: in 2009, when they wore Devil Rays \\"rainbow\\" uniforms from their 1998 inaugural season.\\"Rays have worn a variety of throwback uniforms\\" St. Pete Times Usually, the Rays' opponent on Turn Back the Clock night wear throwbacks of their own from the same era as the Rays' retro uniforms. For example, the Houston Astros wore their 1980s \\"Rainbow Guts\\" uniforms, the Dodgers wore the 1955 road uniforms of the Brooklyn Dodgers, the Mets wore the road unis of their 1969 championship team, and the Orioles wore their rare all-orange uniforms from the early 1970s. The San Diego Padres have also worn multiple throwback uniforms. Pre-1969 designs have represented the Padres of the Pacific Coast League. During the 2010 season, throwback uniforms were worn during all Thursday home day games. Multiple designs and color schemes were used, including the 1969 \\"first major league season\\" brown and gold, 1984 \\"first World Series\\" white with gold lettering and brown trim (and \\"RAK\\" on the sleeves for then-recently deceased owner Ray A. Kroc), and a 1990s era white with orange-trimmed blue lettering (while these were the accurate Padres jersey of the period, the design is also very similar to that of the New York Mets, as the owners of the team at the time were investors from New York). All of these were fairly accurate representations of the team's uniforms and colors of the period, and in most games the visiting team wore throwback uniforms of a similar period. For example, at the final home game on September 30, the visiting Chicago Cubs and the Padres both wore 1984-era jerseys, in tribute to the 1984 NLCS, in which the same two teams played against each other. In recent years, the Milwaukee Brewers have resurrected their old 1980s pinstriped uniforms with the old ball-in-glove \\"MB\\" logo on the caps for use as an alternate uniform. In 2008, the Toronto Blue Jays unveiled their new \\"Flashback Friday\\" powder blue throwback uniforms, similar to those worn between the 1977 and 1979 seasons. The Cleveland Indians throwbacks are usually worn once a year in July and normally are based on their uniforms from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s (most notably, their 1974 \\"All Red\\" home uniforms), They have also worn uniforms based on the 1948 Indians in honor of Larry Doby, the first African-American player in the American League with the Indians. The 2011 Arizona Diamondbacks celebrated the tenth anniversary of their 2001 World Series championship on September 9‚Äì11. To commemorate the event the Diamondbacks held a reunion of players who had been on the championship team. They also wore the purple, teal, and copper uniforms that the team wore from 1998 to 2006. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of Fenway Park, the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox wore 1912 throwbacks during a regular-season game on April 20, 2012; the Yankees' 1912 uniforms were a nod to their days as the New York Highlanders. In the 1999 season, MLB held a series of \\"Turn Ahead the Clock\\" nights. It was inspired by an independently held promotion on July 18, 1998 at a game between the Seattle Mariners and the Kansas City Royals. During those nights, teams wore uniforms envisioned as they might be in the year 2021. Twenty-two teams ultimately participated over 13 different games in 1999, with some teams wearing the uniforms more than once. The promotion proved unpopular, and has yet to be repeated since. In 2016, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their 1986 world championship season, the New York Mets revived their 1986 uniforms to be used for all Sunday home games. === Other leagues === In 1921 a baseball game held at Rickwood Field as part of the Semicentennial of Birmingham, Alabama was played in \\"old-style\\" uniforms and according to \\"the rules of the games as they were in 1872.\\".\\"Baseball Fans Given Rare Treat at Wood.\\" (October 26, 1921) The Birmingham News Since 1996 Rickwood Field has been the site of the annual \\"Rickwood Classic\\", a regular season Birmingham Barons game in which both Southern League teams wear uniforms honoring some period of their respective histories. The Lotte Giants of the Korea Baseball Organization has \\"Again 1984/1992\\" day once per month in commemoration of their league titles from those respective years. The team dresses in their old baby blue jerseys as well as their old cap, complete with the old logo. The \\"Again 1984/1992\\" games are usually the most popular games of the year in Busan, with the stadium as well as the throwback merchandising usually selling out fast. Due to this success, starting in 2008, other teams in the league such as Doosan Bears and Samsung Lions have started to incorporate a similar style of throwback day as well. The Buffalo Bisons of the International League adopted a throwback uniform as their main jersey in 2012 as part of their change in parent club affiliation to the Toronto Blue Jays. == Basketball == === National Basketball Association === In the 1996‚Äì97 NBA season, the NBA celebrated its 50th anniversary by introducing throwback jerseys, known as \\"Hardwood Classics\\". The Toronto Raptors were notable for wearing the uniforms of the long-defunct Toronto Huskies, an original BAA team. The Raptors have since brought back this tradition on certain occasions, notably games against the New York Knicks. The Chicago Bulls wore script-logo throwbacks from the beginning of Michael Jordan's career. Some of the throwbacks that were introduced in this season have been brought back on more occasions since, notably the Golden State Warriors, whose throwback placed the players' numbers inside an angled cable car (a reference to San Francisco, where they had played in the early years in California). In more recent years, throwback jerseys in the NBA have recalled some of the more gaudy uniforms of the NBA and the ABA, ranging from the aforementioned Warriors uniforms, to the Detroit Pistons' lightning bolt uniforms of the Dick Vitale era of the late 1970s, to the Miami Floridians throwbacks worn by the Heat, and the Cleveland Cavaliers' 1980s era jerseys worn by Brad Daugherty, Mark Price, and Ron Harper as well as uniforms based on the early and mid-1970s. In contrast, the New York Knicks often wear throwback uniforms from the 1970s and 1980s that are understated by comparison. The warmups and uniform shorts of that era feature an \\"interlocking NY\\" identical to the one worn by the New York Yankees on their caps and home jerseys. Most \\"Hardwood Classics\\" jerseys worn by current players for games, however, are based on modern fabrics, and not the classic fabric designs of the past. The Los Angeles Lakers wore throwback short-shorts in 2007 for one game. Kobe Bryant complained, saying, \\"I feel violated. I feel naked. It's one thing to see those old guys wearing them on film, it's another to actually wear them\\". The Philadelphia 76ers began wearing throwback jerseys from their championship season of 1982‚Äì83 in 2007‚Äì08 to honor the 25th anniversary of their championship. They were so popular that the Sixers kept these jerseys for next year, and reverted to their old logo (modified with a newer \\"6\\") for the 2009‚Äì10 season. The Orlando Magic are notable for wearing the same throwback design at least twice; their black pinstriped throwback was used in 2003‚Äì04, 2006‚Äì07 and 2009‚Äì10 seasons. They also wore the blue pinstriped throwbacks in 2004‚Äì05 and the white pinstriped throwbacks in 2005‚Äì06. The then-New Orleans Hornets, Charlotte Bobcats, Los Angeles Clippers, Minnesota Timberwolves and Memphis Grizzlies were also notable for wearing throwbacks of long-forgotten American Basketball Association franchises New Orleans Buccaneers, Carolina Cougars, Los Angeles Stars, Minnesota Muskies and Memphis Tams/Pros. The San Antonio Spurs also paid tribute to their predecessors Dallas Chaparrals, while the Bulls and the Washington Wizards did the same to a pair of former Chicago-based NBA franchises, the Stags and Zephyrs. The usage of throwback uniforms even inspired some NBA teams to acquire elements used from old uniform designs in creating new ones. For example, the Detroit Pistons, Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors reverted to their original color schemes while adding some accent colors to create a more modern look, while the Magic and the Charlotte Bobcats revived the use of pinstripes on their uniforms. The Dallas Mavericks briefly used a third jersey with the green, blue and white color scheme of the 1980s. The Houston Rockets revived the classic red and gold scheme in unveiling their new alternate uniform in 2009. The Utah Jazz are re-using their classic \\"J\\" note logo and a similar (though not the same) color scheme, and also plan to adopt a similar uniform design to what they originally wore from 1974 to 1996. The Washington Wizards also went retro, with secondary logos inspired from the old Bullets logos and the modernized \\"Stars and Stripes\\" uniform worn from 1974 through 1987. The New York Knicks eliminated black from their color scheme and unveiled a modern adaptation of their 1970‚Äì75 uniforms, sans the shorts' side stripes, addition of silver trim, and a bolder, less arched \\"NEW YORK\\" script. The Sacramento Kings have used their classic Kansas City-era script to their gold and then black alternate uniforms. The Denver Nuggets revived the 'rainbow' uniforms from the 1980s as an alternate uniform, this time with the current colors and typeface, while the Oklahoma City Thunder wore alternate uniforms with a vertically arranged front script similar to those worn by the Oscar Robertson- era Cincinnati Royals. The Phoenix Suns paid tribute to the 1990s by unveiling new uniforms featuring a modified streaking sun. As of 2019, NBA throwback uniforms are classified as part of Nike's Classic series. The uniforms were replicas of past jersey designs and feature truncated arm stripes, the Nike logo on the right chest and space for an advertiser logo on the left chest. === Other leagues === In 2003, the Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball team wore throwback jerseys in home games against Kansas and Missouri to celebrate the program's 100th anniversary season. The jerseys were lavender with black letters and numerals, similar to the uniforms worn by Jack Hartman's teams in the 1970s and 1980s, during some of KSU's best seasons. The Kansas Jayhawks basketball team wore throwbacks in March 2005 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Allen Fieldhouse. In February 2008 and February 2013, they wore throwbacks for the 20th and 25th anniversaries, respectively, of the 1988 NCAA championship team, and did so again in February 2012 to honor the 1952 NCAA championship team's 60th anniversary. == Box lacrosse == The Philadelphia Wings indoor lacrosse team ditched their silver, red, and black uniforms for a game to wear their original orange and white jerseys worn in the early 1970s from the original National Lacrosse League. For the 100th anniversary of the rivalry between Johns Hopkins and Maryland in men's lacrosse, both teams wore special retro jerseys.Rivalry 101: Terps vs. Johns Hopkins, The Diamondback, April 15, 2005. During the 35th anniversary of women's field hockey at Dartmouth College, the Big Green are wearing a special harlequin-design throwback uniform. == Canadian football == === Canadian Football League === The first documented use of a throwback uniform came during the 1998 season, when the Calgary Stampeders wore 1948 red striped jerseys to celebrate the first Grey Cup championship won by the Stampeders franchise. The jerseys were worn on October 4, 1998 against the BC Lions. The BC Lions were the next to wear throwback jerseys in 2003, as they were celebrating their 50th season with orange replica jerseys from the 1954 BC Lions season. Those jerseys were worn four times that season with the first being the home opener that year. In both cases, neither uniform was accurate as the jerseys were paired with pants and helmets from both teams' present day sets. In 2007, the Saskatchewan Roughriders wore green replica jerseys from the late 1960s to 1970s with double white striping over the shoulders. As opposed to the single season usage the Stampeders and Lions employed, the Roughriders wore these jerseys from 2007 to 2013, including their usage in the 97th and 98th Grey Cup. It wasn't until the 2008 CFL season that the league started to truly embrace throwback uniforms when they announced that the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and Toronto Argonauts would play two games (September 12 in Toronto and October 10 in Winnipeg) to celebrate and recognize the 1950s and in particular, the 1950 Mud Bowl Grey Cup game. Both teams wore coloured jerseys, as was common during the 1950s. Toronto's jerseys were a light blue in colour, with dark blue striping on the sleeves and the team's old \\"Pull Together\\" football-as-a-ship logo on the shoulders. The Blue Bombers' jerseys were dark blue in colour, with gold sleeve stripes. The team's 1950s-era logo was on the front of the jersey, just below the V in the neck. A special CFL \\"Retro Week\\" logo adorned each jersey as well, that logo being a take-off of the maple leaf one used as the league symbol from 1954 through 1969. For the 2009 CFL season, all eight teams wore retro uniforms, this time based on uniforms from the 1960s. Week 3 of the 2009 season featured all teams wearing their retro uniforms. When revealed at the time, four teams had white retro jerseys and four had coloured retro jerseys. As the season progressed, Saskatchewan added a green 1960s jersey for the Labour Day Classic and Calgary wore a white 1960s jersey for the Labour Day rematch versus Edmonton. 11 games were scheduled during the season to feature both teams wearing these uniforms while more were added later on. In 2010, all eight teams again wore retro uniforms and for this season it was based on uniforms worn from the 1970s. Teams wore retro uniforms during weeks 6 and 7, however, contrary to the previous year, only the Saskatchewan Roughriders wore white throwback uniforms, meaning most teams wore their regular white uniforms as the away team. The Roughriders wore their regular 1970s throwback jersey during retro games they hosted. Additionally, during this season, the Roughriders were celebrating their 100th anniversary as a franchise and wore black, red, and silver throwback uniforms similar to the ones worn by the Regina Roughriders from 1912 to 1947. These uniforms were worn on July 17, 2010. While the league had originally planned to celebrate with retro uniforms each season leading up to the 100th Grey Cup, the CFL did not introduce 1980s-themed uniforms for the 2011 CFL season. Some teams (Calgary, Saskatchewan, Toronto, and Winnipeg) continued wearing the previous year's retro uniforms while the rest wore no throwback uniforms at all. In 2012, all teams remodeled their full uniform set with only Saskatchewan and Winnipeg carrying over their 1970s throwback uniforms. In 2013, the Toronto Argonauts wore 1980s throwback uniforms on August 23, 2013 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the 71st Grey Cup championship. Also that year, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats wore red, black, and white replicas of the 1943 Hamilton Flying Wildcats to celebrate the 70th anniversary of their 31st Grey Cup victory. In both cases, the uniforms from these games were worn only once. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers wore 1980s-themed uniforms from 2013 to 2015 before switching full-time to similar royal blue jerseys in 2016. The Roughriders introduced new throwback uniforms based on the uniforms from the early 1980s in 2014 and wore them again in 2015. The franchise introduced another green retro-styled jersey in 2016, but due to lack of numbers on the shoulders, were never actually worn before in their history. As of the 2015 CFL season, the Saskatchewan Roughriders, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, and Toronto Argonauts have worn throwback uniforms representing four different decades, which is the most in the league. The Roughriders have worn six different throwback jerseys, including two white jerseys, which is also the most in the league. No Ottawa franchise (Ottawa Rough Riders, Ottawa Renegades, and Ottawa Redblacks) has ever worn a throwback uniform, presumably due to their checkered absences from the league over the past 20 years. == Cricket == In February 2005 at Eden Park, Auckland, Australia and New Zealand contested the very first Twenty20 cricket international match. Both teams appeared in retro 1980s-style tight- fitting one day international uniforms without team names, numbers or sponsors' logos. The Australians wore their original \\"yellow and gold\\" whilst New Zealand were in \\"beige\\" inspired by the Beige Brigade sports fans. The game was played in a light-hearted manner with both teams sporting 1980s-style head bands, moustaches and hairstyles. == Cycling == When Lance Armstrong won his fifth Tour de France championship, in 2003, his U.S. Postal Service- sponsored team wore a special jersey sporting the old U.S. Mail logo from the 1970s for the final day of the race. This was not technically a throwback jersey, as the team itself did not exist in that era, and had only been affiliated with USPS since 1998. == Ice hockey == === National Hockey League === Throwbacks were first introduced in the National Hockey League in their 75th anniversary season of 1991‚Äì92. At the time, only the Original Six teams wore throwbacks, although they were also used in the All-Star game. While the NHL had long since replaced the heavy wool sweaters with more modern air-knit jerseys, the patterns for the 75th anniversary throwbacks were consistent with the original versions, with a few exceptions (as noted below). Player surnames were worn on the back of the throwback jerseys, even though this was not originally the case (the NHL did not require names on the jerseys until 1977). The Original Six teams' throwbacks included the following modifications: * Boston Bruins ‚Äì c. 1927 through 1931 \\"shield logo\\" design The Bruins' colors were brown and gold during this era, but the throwback jerseys use a \\"basic black\\" scheme with a small amount of white and gold trim, with the \\"shield logo\\" on the front of the jersey, and the \\"spoked-B\\" modern day regular logo placed on the jersey shoulders. For the Winter Classic that they hosted at Fenway Park on January 1, 2010, they wore adapted replicas of the first \\"Spoked B\\" logo from 1947 to 1948 on the 1955‚Äì58 gold jerseys. * Chicago Blackhawks ‚Äì c. 1940 design The Blackhawks' \\"barber pole\\" design was used one more time, in a game against Detroit at Chicago Stadium in January 1994. A c.-1936 design, featuring beige in the color scheme, was used in the 2009 NHL Winter Classic on January 1, 2009 at Chicago's Wrigley Field; it would become the team's third jersey for the 2009‚Äì10 season. * Detroit Red Wings ‚Äì c. 1928 design At the time the design was originally worn, the Red Wings were known as the Cougars. They wore their throwbacks again in the aforementioned game at Chicago Stadium in 1994. (The design was also used by Wayne Gretzky's team of All-Stars that toured Europe during the 1994‚Äì95 NHL lockout, and by the Adirondack Red Wings as a third jersey). For the Winter Classic in 2009, the Wings donned a modified version of their inaugural 1926 sweater, which featured a single red stripe across the chest with a stylized \\"D\\" in the center, along with the current winged wheel logo to the shoulders. * Montreal Canadiens ‚Äì c. 1926 design The Canadiens' red jerseys have changed very little. The differences between the throwback and their current jersey were the crew collar and the duplicate Canadiens logo on the left sleeve. Three \\"retro\\" jersey designs from the Canadiens' past were authorized as part of the team's centennial celebration in 2009, including a \\"barber pole\\" design of red, white and blue horizontal stripes. * New York Rangers ‚Äì c. 1940 design This jersey was notable because it was of the style the Rangers wore when they had last won the Stanley Cup. (They won the cup again two years later.) * Toronto Maple Leafs ‚Äì c. 1940 design The two-stripe design was used for many years by the Maple Leafs, and after over two decades of the single-stripe design, the Leafs adopted a new version of the two-stripe design the following season. * Wales Conference All-Stars ‚Äì c. 1952 design (white) * Campbell Conference All-Stars ‚Äì c. 1952 design (red) The stripes running down the sleeves of the All-Star jerseys were wider than those on the original versions. As other leagues began using throwbacks, interest in retro jerseys increased within the NHL. To celebrate new ownership, the New York Islanders wore a modified throwback design for one game in 1998. The Buffalo Sabres pulled a similar stunt for a game in 2003. The Toronto Maple Leafs also brought back a 1960s-era jersey as a third jersey beginning in 1998‚Äì99. In 2003‚Äì04, the NHL implemented a Vintage program, allowing several teams to wear throwback uniforms that were specially branded with a vintage \\"V\\" patch. The following teams were among those that participated in the program: * Boston Bruins ‚Äì c. 1970s uniforms These were notable as the Bobby Orr-era uniforms. The black throwbacks would replace the gold third jerseys in 2006. * Edmonton Oilers ‚Äì c. 1990s uniforms The current Oilers only wore the white uniforms once, for the Heritage Classic. The Oilers alumni wore the blue version for the preceding MegaStars game. For 2008‚Äì09, this uniform served as the Oilers' third jersey and became the team's primary jersey in 2009‚Äì10. * Los Angeles Kings ‚Äì c. 1977 uniforms * Montreal Canadiens ‚Äì c. 1946 (white), c. 1960 (red) The white throwbacks, similar in design to the red jersey with its blue-and- white stripe across the chest, continued to be worn as an alternate jersey in subsequent seasons. The red throwbacks featured a tie-up collar, a design feature that has seen a comeback in recent years, although it's there strictly for aesthetic purposes. * New York Islanders ‚Äì 1972‚Äì73 This uniform, from the team's first season featured similar-(though not the same) colored numbers on similar (though not the same)-colored trim against a royal blue background, serving as the 2008‚Äì09 and 2009‚Äì10 third jersey, was elevated to their full-time home uniform in 2010‚Äì11. * New York Rangers ‚Äì c. 1977 uniforms This uniform featured the team's shield logo instead of \\"RANGERS\\" written diagonally across the chest. Ironically, these throwback jerseys were actually newer in design than their regular jerseys. * St. Louis Blues ‚Äì c. 1979 uniforms Their then-current uniforms, introduced in 1998, were at least partially inspired by these uniforms. * Vancouver Canucks ‚Äì c. 1977 uniforms The blue throwbacks would replace their screen-printed red/blue alternate in 2006. These throwbacks served as the basis for Vancouver's new uniforms in 2007. * Philadelphia Flyers ‚Äì c. 1974 uniforms The first two times the Flyers wore these jerseys, the numbers were the same as the old ones. The numbers on the throwbacks worn in 2008‚Äì09 are the same as the numbers on their current road and third jerseys. These will serve as the Flyers' primary home jerseys for the 2009‚Äì10 season; a white version was used for the Winter Classic at Fenway Park January 1; these will serve as of 2010‚Äì11 as their road uniforms. A few teams also introduced \\"fauxback\\" uniform (a term that was coined by Paul Lukas, the creator of the Uni Watch column and blog, for a uniform design not worn in the past, but given the appearance of decades-old vintage) designs as alternate jerseys. The Colorado Avalanche introduced burgundy third jerseys similar in design to the New York Rangers' blue ones, while the Minnesota Wild introduced a red alternate featuring a logo encased in a circle containing the team's name, a feature previously used by the Blackhawks and Pittsburgh Penguins. The 2004 National Hockey League All-Star Game also featured faux throwback designs. The Sabres introduced a \\"fauxback\\" jersey designed as an homage to its American Hockey League predecessor, the Bisons, in 2010 and wore it as their third jersey until 2012. The Bruins, Canadiens, Maple Leafs, and Canucks used their throwbacks through 2006‚Äì07. The Buffalo Sabres also wore a throwback blue-and-gold jersey for one season, bringing it back again in 2008‚Äì09, and making it their 2009‚Äì10 home sweater. Although third jerseys were temporarily discontinued for 2007‚Äì08 so that teams could get used to the new Rbk Edge uniforms (third jerseys returned for the 2008‚Äì09 season), Boston and Vancouver have adopted new uniforms that are based on their throwback designs. On January 1, 2008, the Sabres and the Penguins donned throwback uniforms in the AMP Energy NHL Winter Classic at Ralph Wilson Stadium in Orchard Park, New York, albeit with Reebok's \\"Edge\\" design template. The Penguins also used the throwbacks as their third jersey for the 2008‚Äì09 season. And as mentioned earlier, at the 2009 NHL Winter Classic, the Blackhawks and the Red Wings wore throwback replicas at Wrigley Field and the Flyers and Bruins donned retro schemes at Fenway Park in 2010. For the 2011 game, the Penguins (1967‚Äì68) and their opposition, the Washington Capitals (1974‚Äì75) are expected to wear their first season replicates. In recent years, CCM, now owned by Reebok, has made additional replica throwbacks available for sale, in addition to those in current use. 1992 throwbacks such as Detroit's and Chicago's were among those reissued, while others included older-era jerseys of current NHL teams the Phoenix Coyotes, the Colorado Avalanche, the Dallas Stars, the Carolina Hurricanes and the New Jersey Devils when they had played in their former markets of (Winnipeg, Quebec City, Bloomington, Minnesota, Hartford and Denver). The much-maligned \\"Flying-V\\" uniforms of the Vancouver Canucks were also reissued. The Winnipeg jerseys were particularly popular and were seen throughout Winnipeg after it became clear that a new Winnipeg Jets franchise would be established in 2011; Jets jerseys were prevalent at the 2011 NHL Draft, where the new Jets' name was revealed. When Adidas reinstated the third jersey program in the 2018‚Äì19 season, a few teams used the occasion to unveil Heritage uniforms, which were only used at least three times and on a part-time basis. Among the teams that participated include the Maple Leafs (white/green St. Patricks' design from the 1920s), Devils (1980s home design), Jets (design based on the original Jets' WHA uniforms), Oilers (blue uniforms from the Wayne Gretzky era) and Hurricanes (late 1980s Hartford Whalers green uniform). For the 2019‚Äì20 season, the Canucks wore their \\"skate blade\\" uniforms from the 1990s, while the Kings brought back their 1990s white uniforms for a few games. A few other teams, namely the Arizona Coyotes, Calgary Flames, St. Louis Blues and Washington Capitals, reinstated their throwbacks as full-fledged alternates, although the Blues did bring back their mid-1990s blue uniforms for a few games in the 2019‚Äì20 season. == See also == * Retro style * Away colors * Third jersey * Mitchell & Ness * Special paint scheme ‚Äì \\"Retro\\" paint jobs found their way into NASCAR in the 1990s * Turn Ahead the Clock == References == == External links == * ESPN Page 2 looks at Major League Baseball throwbacks worn in 2002 * NHL Uniforms.com, visual history of NHL uniforms * NFL 75th Anniversary Throwbacks * AFL Heritage Round Category:Design Category:Retro style Category:Sports terminology Category:Sports uniforms Category:Replicas Category:Nostalgia ","title":"Throwback uniform"},{"id":"1436520","text":"Tamias is a genus of chipmunks within the tribe Marmotini of the squirrel family.

These classifications are arbitrary, and most taxonomies over the twentieth century have placed the chipmunks in a single genus. However, studies of mitochondrial DNA show that the divergence between each of the three chipmunk groups is comparable to the genetic dissimilarity between Marmota and Spermophilus., so each of the three genera have been split.

In it had a population of . Throughout the ages, the site of the modern city was controlled by many people, including the Romans, the Ottoman and the British. The modern city was established on the site of the Palestinian Arab village of al-Tira. The town of Tirat Carmel was officially declared a city in 1992. ==History== Tirat Carmel is built on the ruins of the town of al-Tira. Crusaders called it St Yohan de Tire.Khalidi (1992), p. 195 It was ruled by the Ottomans in late medieval and Renaissance times and was an agricultural area with wheat and goats and other farms.Khalidi, 1992, p.196. While conscription in the late 1800s harmed the town, it recovered, and by 1945 was an agricultural Muslim community with a Christian minority. The town was known for production of olives and almonds. In 1949 two absorption centers were established for Jewish immigrants in the same location, which in 1954 were reorganized into the municipality of Tirat Carmel. ==Demographics== According to CBS, in 2001 the ethnic makeup of the city was 99.6% Jewish and other non-Arab, with no significant Arab population.

In New Zealand, multiple names have been given, including kƒÅkatai, matuku moana and matuku tai. It is known as bel≈ç in Fiji, matu'u in the Samoan Islands, and motuku in Niue, Tonga, and Wallis Island. == Description == Pacific reef herons are medium-sized herons, reaching 57 to 66 cm in length. They have a wingspan of between 90 and 110 cm and reach an average weight of 400 grams. The species displays an unusual, non-sexual dimorphism, with some members having entirely white plumage ('light' morph) and others (the larger portion) being charcoal-grey ('dark' morph). The reason for the colour variation or \\"morph\\", is unknown, though it is most commonly thought to be related to camouflage. The plumage of immature herons tends to be browner and duller in colour. Pacific reef herons have very short, yellow legs, and the grey variety's throats and chins are marked by a narrow, white stripe. They have brown beaks, gold-yellow coloured eyes and the surrounding areas of their faces are normally of a greenish to yellow cast. == Distribution and habitat == The Pacific reef heron is widely distributed across southern Asia and Oceania. In Australia, Pacific reef herons inhabits most of the coastline, and offshore islands including the Torres Strait Islands. Pacific reef herons are widespread across Micronesia, with breeding records in Guam, the Marshall Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, and Palau, among various other islands. The species also breeds throughout western Polynesia, including in Fiji, French Polynesia, and Tonga ‚Äì though it does not breed in Niue. Surveys of the Fijian island of Rotuma, conducted in 1991 and 2018, suggest that the Pacific reef heron has recently colonized the island. New Zealand is considered to be the southern limit of the Pacific reef heron's distribution. Despite being relatively uncommon, the herons are found throughout the country, though are most common in Northland. == Behaviour and ecology == === Breeding === The species lay clutches of eggs year-round in colonies in the jungle, between palms and mangroves or in cavities of old buildings. Two to three paled greenish-blue eggs are laid in nests constructed from branches and blossoms. Males and females share brooding tasks. They normally have a 28-day brood period. After chicks are hatched, parents provide approximately 5 weeks of support. === Food and feeding === Their food sources are made up predominantly of varieties of ocean-based fish, crustaceans and molluscs. == Conservation status == In New Zealand, the Pacific reef heron has the conservation status of \\"Nationally endangered\\". It has been classified as \\"Regionally Critical\\" in the Wellington region. == Gallery == Eastern Reef Egret - dark morph.jpgDark morph Eastern reef egrets in Ko Tao.jpgTwo colour morphs, Ko Tao, Thailand Eastern Reef-Egret96.oggMooloolaba, Australia Juvenile Reef Egret.jpgJuvenile dark morph, Coral Bay, Western Australia ==References== * Bruce Campbell (1974).

Enterprise Project Management is a way of thinking, communicating and working, supported by an information system, that organizes enterprise's resources in a direct relationship to the leadership's vision and the mission, strategy, goals and objectives that move the organization forward. Simply put, EPM provides a 360 degree view of the organization's collective efforts. In recent years, with general adoption of (IT) governance practices, Enterprise Project Management has become more specific: whereas in the 1990s focus was generally on the management of the single project, in the subsequent decade, the focus lay more on the fact that a project is likely to be not the only one in the enterprise. The project co- exists with many other projects in the enterprise, or may be part of one or more programs. It may utilize (human) resources that are shared among other projects. In order to facilitate governance, it has become essential to be able to manage, monitor, and assess the status of all projects (and other assets, of course) in the enterprise, through a set of (preferably uniform) Enterprise Project Management processes, methods and application packages. Typically, organizations that adopt an Enterprise Project Management way of working, might set up a Project Management Office (PMO)/ Enterprise Project Management Office (EPMO), which is said to be more successful than a traditional PMO in addressing the priorities of the organization as its scope is enterprise-wideThe Strategic Importance of the Enterprise Project Management Office Accessed: 2010-05-02), might select and adopt a Project Management Methodology like PRINCE2, PMBOK (or create a proprietary method) or follow the concepts of IPMA Competence Baseline as a foundation for development and certification of project managers and their knowledge, experience and behaviour. They might even select and implement a software system to support Enterprise Project Management. An even more recent evolution in Enterprise Project Management is to not only plan and track the existing set of projects, but to create a portfolio (per budget size, per calendar year, per budget year, per business line, et cetera) of existing and future (demand) projects. This is called Project Portfolio Management. Just like the management of a portfolio of shares, Project Portfolio Management is the activity of selecting which projects to keep in portfolio (because of their anticipated value) and which ones to discard (because of their obsoleteness or because they will not yield the value that was initially calculated). Project Portfolio Management includes the creation of various scenarios to decide which is the best portfolio (for a certain year, business, budget, etcetera). Once the contents of the portfolio are agreed upon, it is key to constantly scrutinize how the individual projects are evolving in terms of quality, cost and schedule. Implementing an Enterprise Project Management toolset needs to be considered in the light of the organization's Project Management Maturity and the methodologies, processes and governance structures that are currently in place. There are many consulting organizations that can support such implementations. ==See also== *Strategic enterprise management ==References== ==External links== * Genius Project Enterprise Project Management Software * Triskell Entreprise Portfolio Management Software - A PPM+++ Cloud Service * Enterprise Project Management Tools - Wrike Inc. * Enterprise Project Management Solutionss - Changepoint Corporation * Customer-Centric Enterprise Work Management - Leankor Category:Network management Category:Information technology management Category:Project management by type ","title":"Enterprise project management"},{"id":"1436556","text":" L√â Banba (CM11) was a in the Irish Naval Service (INS) and was one of three purchased by the Irish government in light of changing politics in northern Ireland that was creating more gunrunning, and, the beginning of the drugs trade.

It featured a much squarer aerodynamic body, servicing panels, a single large windscreen wiper, a thicker fibreglass body and altered interior, but the chassis, engine and a lot of large components were from the previous model. The improvements gave the Rialto improved high-speed stability as well as improved fuel economy. The Rialto was built in a number of different models from a saloon, estate, van, hatchback, pickup and flatbed. Rialtos also came in a number of different series: the MkI models from 1982 to 1983; the Rialto 2 series from 1983 to 1986 and the Rialto SE from 1987 until 1997. Upon release the Rialto had a 12-month waiting list and was one of Reliant's best-selling models ever, but it never gained as much praise as the better-known Robin. In the 1980s the Rialto was Reliant's only 3 wheeler model; the MkI Robin ended production in 1981 and only in 1989 was the MkII Robin introduced. == MkI Rialto == The MkI Rialto series was available in three separate body styles: saloon, estate and van. The range consisted of basic specification with a vinyl interior and could be ordered with a list of choice optional extras, or GLS specification which came with a clock, FM/AM radio, voltage gauge, cloth covered seats with extra matching cloth covered areas on the interior, extra thick carpets with a carpeted boot area, GLS decals, leather steering wheel, spare wheel and radial tyres. All cars had a dark green dash with dark grey door cards. The sole available engine was Reliant's own four-cylinder 850 cc \\"red top\\" (so-called because of its red rocker cover) mated to a four-speed gearbox. This engine was carried over from the previous MkI Robin and produced 40 hp, a top speed of 85 mph and fuel consumption of up to 60 mpg. The most recognisable feature of a MkI Rialto is the thick stripe which runs front to rear, in either gold, graphite or silver according to body colour. == The Rialto 2 == The Rialto 2 model was the second version of the Rialto and was released to the public in late 1983. It featured a number of improvements over its predecessor, including a reworked engine (the 850 engine now had an ultra skimmed head to raise the compression ratio along with a new camshaft for improved low-end torque), a new needle in the SU carburetor and a specific distributor. This engine was named the \\"economy\\" engine, with each unit featuring a capital 'E' stamped on the cylinder head, and every engine number ending with a capital 'E'. The rocker cover was painted yellow, which gave the engine the nickname \\"the yellow top\\". Reliant had initially wanted to launch the original Rialto with these improvements but were unable due to time pressures during development, therefore the original MkI Rialto was a compromise to build demand using a number of carryover parts from the Robin. To match the new engine, the rear axle ratio was raised to 2.78/1 (and can be identified with 'B' stamped on diff case). This, combined with the engine, gave the car a much higher top speed of 100 mph and a fuel economy figure of 72mpg at 56 mph. The engine now produced peak torque at lower engine speeds, and the axle allowed the Rialto to cruise at 70 mph at lower revs. This created the disadvantage of not being able to cruise at 30 mph in 4th gear. Rialtos now had vinyl seats on basic models or corduroy cloth seats on GLS models. All Rialto models whatever their specification now had a vacuum economy gauge along with a new decal set of a double coach line with \\"RIALTO 2\\" on the wings and rear door and new hub caps. Another visual improvement on GLS models were black plastic bumpers which wrapped around the front and rear. By late 1984 the Rialto 2 was re- released with an altered specification, the rear axle ratio was returned to 3.23/1 as customers complained of being unable to use 4th gear at city speeds and the economy gauge was no longer fitted. == Rialto SE == The Rialto SE was introduced in 1986. Whilst the best selling model in the Rialto 2 range was the estate, Reliant introduced for the first time a hatchback Rialto, after much development to the roof structure to add enough strength for the tailgate hinges. This model was a huge commercial success and soon become Reliant's best selling model. Mechanical parts of the new Rialto SE had now gone back to the standard specification engine but now with a grey rocker cover, the engine using a pre-engaged starter motor for improved starting. Bodywork now came in brighter colours than before, as well as now having a black decal border running along the bottom of the car which fades out plus a single orange pin stripe running front to rear in the centre of the car. With the Rialto hatchback now in the range the Rialto saloon was the cheapest car in the whole range but by 1995 the saloon had been deleted from the range. The MkII Robin of 1989 replaced the Rialto SE hatchback. By 1990 a roller bearing clutch was also introduced on all models. The MkII Robin estate was released by 1992, but the Rialto SE estate continued in production as a cheaper alternative even though the only differences between the cars were the body design. Some MkII Robin estates were sometimes registered wrongly as Reliant Rialto SE estates. In 1997 the Rialto received the same improvements as the new Robin: it gained 12-inch wheels, a new braking system, different interior trim and an updated dashboard design with new dials. Additionally, a Reliant Rialto pickup named 'Giant' was built which was introduced as a production model in 1997, but only for a limited time on a small production run. The last Rialto model to be built was the estate, and production of the Rialto finally finished in 1997. === Unfounded myths === One of the most widely known myths is that a Reliant three-wheeled vehicle would have to have reverse gear removed or blanked off from its gearbox for someone to drive it on a motorcycle licence. This was true in the early 1960s but ceased to be the case soon after as the lack of mobility in reverse was dangerous to the driver and other road users. Another myth is that a three-wheel Reliant isn't allowed on British motorways. This is not the case as any two-, three- or four-wheeled vehicle is allowed on the motorway as long as its displacement is over 50 cc. Some people believe that one can drive a three-wheeled Reliant on a compulsory basic training (CBT) driving licence, but this is incorrect as Reliants have engines larger than the CBT licence allows. A full motorcycle or full car driving licence is required, and the driver must also be over 21 to drive a Reliant. === Driving a Reliant on a motorcycle licence === Holders of motorcycle licences in the UK would also receive a B1 category entitlement, thereby allowing them to drive a three- or four-wheeled vehicle of up to 550kg. The B1 entitlement ceased to be issued by the DVLA after 2001. Interest in the Reliant increased once more after January 2013, when the licensing scheme was changed once again. From then until the present, a holder of a full A category motorcycle licence over the age of 21 may drive a three-wheeled vehicle of any power. Because of these licensing changes a Reliant Robin cannot be driven with a learner's permit.

Born in London, he made his first appearance onstage in 1895. He left the stage briefly to pursue a degree in engineering and returned to appear with Beerbohm Tree's company in 1904. He gained fame as a Shakespearian actor appearing on London and New York stages. In 1931, Anson made his screen debut in John Ford's film Arrowsmith. Director Frank Capra cast him to play the \\"High Lama\\" in his film Lost Horizon, but Anson died before filming so the role was given to Sam Jaffe. Anson died in Monrovia, California. ==Stage career== His father was the Shakespearean and character actor George W. Anson. His stage debut was at the Court Theatre in London on 27 April 1895. In 1904 (like his father at around this time) he joined Herbert Beerbohm Tree's company. In 1905 he played Brabantio in Othello, his first major role. In 1905 he toured the USA: he appeared in the play The Toast of the Town by Clyde Fitch, with Viola Allen and Hassard Short. Julia Neilson and Anson in Henry of Navarre He first appeared in New York in 1902, in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. As a member of the New Theatre Company, which included many English actors, he was in the first play produced in the New Theatre in New York, opening on 6 November 1909, playing Octavian in Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, and was in Galsworthy's Strife, opening on 17 November. The company produced Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor, which opened on 7 November 1910, Anson playing Master Ford. This last play came in December 1910 to Toronto, where a reviewer wrote, \\"Mr. Anson was especially fine as the jealous husband Ford. Indeed his was a performance that deepened the significance of the play.\\" He was in The Witness for the Defence by A. E. W. Mason, which ran for 64 performances at the Empire Theatre, opening in December 1911. This came to Toronto, where the same reviewer wrote, \\"Mr. A. E. Anson... is known to be one of the most eloquent actors of the day ‚Äì a man much of the type of Sir George Alexander, the possessor of a beautiful voice and the bearing of a person of distinction as he is supposed to be in the play.\\" The play Romance by Edward Sheldon, in which Anson played Cornelius van Tuyl, ran for 160 performances in 1913 at the Maxine Elliott Theatre. A critic wrote, \\"Mr. Anson's complete command of the resources of his art is a treat to all lovers of acting, and his suave ease upon the stage a thing to be copied by many a player.\\"\\"What bishops do in their youth\\". Walter Prichard Eaton, Plays and Players: Leaves from a Critic's Scrapbook (1916), page 74. In London, Romance opened at the Duke of York's Theatre on 6 October 1915; Anson, who produced the play, appeared again as van Tuyl. The play ran for 1,049 performances.Longest Running Plays in London and New York stagebeauty.net, accessed January 4, 2017.Page 254 The A to Z of American Theater: Modernism.

He was in the play White Cargo, which ran for 257 performances at the Greenwich Village Theatre, opening in November 1923, Anson playing Witzel. The play was written and staged by Leon Gordon.

He married three times: to actress Cora Busch in 1902 (their daughter Cora Marjorie Viola Anson was born in 1906) and they divorced in 1912; to actress Deirdre Doyle in 1912, they were later divorced; thirdly to actress Mary Malleson, with whom he appeared in New York in The Barton Mystery by Walter C. Hackett in 1917; he also directed this play. During the 1920s he was engaged to, but did not marry, the actress Marjorie Rambeau with whom he was in two New York productions: As You Like It in 1923, and The Road Together (which closed after one performance) by George Middleton in 1924. ==Movies== Anson in Arrowsmith In the 1930s he moved to California. He appeared in the 1931 film Arrowsmith, directed by John Ford. The film was based on the novel of the same name by Sinclair Lewis, about the life of Martin Arrowsmith, an idealistic doctor (played by Ronald Colman); Anson played the part of his mentor Dr Gottlieb. Anson had a minor part in the 1931 film The Road to Singapore, directed by Alfred E. Green. (The film, which featured William Powell, was based on the play Heatwave by Denise Robins and Roland Pertwee). He died on 25 June 1936 in Monrovia, and was buried in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles. ==ReferencesCategory:1879 births Category:1936 deaths Category:English male film actors Category:English male stage actors Category:Burials at Hollywood Forever Cemetery Category:20th-century English male actors Category:British expatriate male actors in the United States ","title":"Albert Edward Anson"},{"id":"1436582","text":" L√â Fola (CM12) was a of the Irish Naval Service.

Together with Mercian, Kentish and West Saxon, it forms one of the sub-categories of Old English devised and employed by modern scholars. The dialect was spoken from the Humber, now within England, to the Firth of Forth, now within Scotland. In the Danelaw after the Viking invasions, Northumbrian came under the influence of the invaders' Norse language. The earliest surviving Old English texts were written in Northumbrian: these are Caedmon's Hymn (7th century) and Bede's Death Song (8th century). Other works, including the bulk of Caedmon's poetry, have been lost. Other examples of this dialect are the Runes on the Ruthwell Cross from the Dream of the Rood. Also in Northumbrian are the 9th-century Leiden RiddleIn MS. Voss. lat. Q. 166 at the University of Leiden (see article by R. W. Zandvoort in English and Germanic Studies, vol. 3 (1949-50)) and the mid-10th-century gloss of the Lindisfarne Gospels. The Viking invasion forced a division of the dialect into two distinct subdialects. South of the River Tees, the southern Northumbrian version was heavily influenced by Norse, while northern Northumbrian retained many Old English words lost to the southern subdialect and influenced the development of English in northern England, especially the dialects of modern North East England (the modern Northumbrian dialect) and Scotland. In addition, Scots (including Ulster Scots) is descended from the Northumbrian dialect, as is modern Northumbrian and other dialects of Northern English. ==History== Extent of Northumbria, Historians of languages recognise four distinct dialects of Old English: Northumbrian, Mercian, Kentish and West Saxon. The Northumbrian dialect () was spoken in the Kingdom of Northumbria (from the Humber on the east coast of northern England to the Firth of Forth in the Scottish Lowlands). Modern Scots, Northumbrian and northern English accents and dialects originate from Northumbrian. It was significantly different from the accents spoken by other Kingdoms, especially that of West- Saxon (the primary dialect). Modern Standard English, on the other hand, has its origins in Mercian dialect. The Angles brought their language (Englisc) to Northumbria in the 6th century AD, where it reached the modern-day Scottish Lowlands. This form of Northumbrian Old English was first recorded in poetic; e.g. C√¶dmon's Hymn ), writings of the Venerable Bede () and the Leiden Riddle. The language is also attested in the Lindisfarne Gospels , in modern Scotland as a carved runic text, the Dream of the Rood, and on the Ruthwell Cross, . Old Northumbria was later conquered by the Danes (867‚Äì883 AD) and from this day forth the language became influenced with Old Norse. The region of Lothian in the Lowlands, which was originally a part of the Kingdom of England, was invaded by Kenneth III of Scotland and became part of Scotland's sovereign territory. Despite the king being a Scottish Gaelic speaker, he allowed the region to keep its Northumbrian dialect, which was then still known as Inglis. However, the region became divided from Northumbria following the Battle of Carham (with the northern half of the territory under Scottish rule and the southern part under the English); the language north of the divide later became known as Scottis or Scots. The anonymous author of the Northumbrian Cursor Mundi, said southern English texts needed to be translated into northern dialects for people to understand what they were reading. Ralph Higden in 1364 described Northumbrian as incredibly difficult for southern natives to understand, believing the reason for this to be the \\"strange men an nations that speaketh stronglie\\" (i.e. the Scots) the region bordered. John of Trevisa spoke about nearby \\"strange men an aliens\\" in discussing northren English's alleged outlandishness, and in Osbern Bokenam wrote about Scots' influence on northern English in his Mappula Angliae. Bi the 14th-century, Lowland Scots became the main language of Scotland's Lowlands (excluding Galloway, which still spoke Gaelic). Despite this, Northumbrian began to lose its significance in England by the 16th century. Northumbrian dialectical terms, accents, and manners of speaking were considered incorrect and inelegant those in power, who were seated in the south of England. As England began to centralise its power in London and the south of England, texts in the midland and southern dialects became the de facto standard. Although a great number of letters, poems an newspaper articles were written in Northumbrian dialect throughout the 19th an 20th centuries, the southern form became the standard of the accent. The modern Northumbrian dialect is currently promoted by the Northumbrian Language Society. ==The Lord's Prayer== Some Scottish and Northumbrian folk still say or \\"our father\\" and \\"thou art\\".Gray, Alasdair, The Book of Prefaces, Bloomsbury Publishing, London 2000 (2002 edition) The Lord's Prayer as rendered below dates from .

Together with Northumbrian, it was one of the two Anglian dialects. The other two dialects of Old English were Kentish and West Saxon. Each of those dialects was associated with an independent kingdom on the island. Of these, all of Northumbria and most of Mercia were overrun by the Vikings during the 9th century. Part of Mercia and all of Kent were successfully defended but were then integrated into the Kingdom of Wessex. Because of the centralisation of power and the Viking invasions, there is little to no salvaged written evidence for the development of non-Wessex dialects after Alfred the Great's unification, until the Middle English period.Skeat, W. W., English Dialects, from the Eighth Century to the Present Day. Cambridge, 1911.Bennett, J. A. W. & Smithers, G. V., Early Middle English Verse and Prose. Oxford, 1968, etc.Dickins, Bruce, & Wilson, R. M. Early Middle English Texts. Cambridge: Bowes & Bowes, 1951. ==History== The Mercian dialect was spoken as far east as the border of East Anglia and as far west as Offa's Dyke, bordering Wales. It was spoken as far north as Staffordshire, bordering Northumbria and Strathclyde, and as far south as South Oxfordshire/ Gloucestershire, where it bordered the Kingdom of Wessex. The Old Norse language also filtered in on a few occasions after the foundation of the Danelaw. This describes the situation before the unification of Mercia. The Old English Martyrology is a collection of over 230 hagiographies, probably compiled in Mercia, or by someone who wrote in the Mercian dialect of Old English, in the second half of the 9th century. Six Mercian hymns are included in the Anglo-Saxon glosses to the Vespasian Psalter; they include the Benedictus and the Magnificat.Sweet, H. (1946) Anglo-Saxon Reader; 10th ed. Clarendon Pr.; pp. 170-179 In later Anglo-Saxon England, the dialect would have remained in use in speech but hardly ever in written documents. Some time after the Norman conquest of England, Middle English dialects emerged and were later found in such works as the Ormulum and the writings of the Gawain poet. In the later Middle Ages, a Mercian or East Midland dialect seems to have predominated in the London area, producing such forms as are (from Mercian arun). Mercian is used by the writer and philologist J.R.R Tolkien to signify his fictional Rohirric language. ==Alphabet== The letters b, d, g, l, m, n, p, q, s, t, v, w, and z behave as in Modern English. *c is always pronounced hard, like cat, never soft like cell. *ƒã is pronounced like ch in cheese. *h at the beginning of a word, hard as in hat. Before t and at the end of a syllable, it is pronounced like ch in loch or the German ich, e.g. niht (translates as night) *ƒ°ƒ° and cg are pronounced as dge as in wedge. *·µπ before a, o, and u, it has a guttural sound, like the French r; before i, e, and y it sounds like the Modern English y. *r always rolled in Scottish style *sƒã and sc both give the 'sh' as in shoe, *f pronounced v as in very (as is found in Modern Welsh). *√¶ the short a as in bat *ƒÅ as in aah *a shortened as in barn *ƒì like the ay in bay *e like the e in bed *ƒ´ like the ee in creek *i as in bin *≈ç as in the o in the Scottish och *o as in caught *≈ìÃÑ like the √∂ in the German sch√∂n *≈ì shortened version of the above *≈´ like oo in moo *u like the ou in Doug *»≥ like the u in the French tu *y shortened version of the above Mercian also uses the eth (√ê and √∞) and thorn (√û and √æ) both give the English 'th' sound as in 'thin' ==Grammar== Mercian grammar has the same structure as other West Germanic dialects. ===Nouns=== Nouns have three genders: masculine, feminine, neuter; and four cases: nominative, accusative, dative and genitive. These, in addition, all have singular and plural forms. They can also be strong or weak. ====Examples==== *Strong masculine noun stƒÅn (stone) **nominative (singular, plural): stƒÅn, stƒÅnes **accusative: stƒÅn, stƒÅnes **dative: stƒÅne, stƒÅnen **genitive: stƒÅnes, stƒÅne *Weak masculine noun name (name) **nominative: name, namen **accusative: namen/name, namen **dative: namen/name, namen **genitive: namen/name. namene/namen ===Pronouns=== Personal pronouns (I/me, you, he, she, we, you (pl.) and they) come in all the above cases and come in three numbers: singular, dual ('you/we two'), plural. Demonstrative pronouns vary in the same way described below for the indefinite article, based on '√∞es' only for this. That and Those are the same as the definite article. Relative pronouns (who, which, that) are usually '√∞e' and '√∞et.' ===Articles=== The definite article is equally complex, with all genders changing in the singular in all cases, based on variations of '√∞e.' In the plural all genders take the same word. The indefinite article was often omitted in Mercian. ===Adjectives=== Adjectives are always declined, even with some verbs (which means they can double up as adverbs), e.g. I am cold. Having split into weak and strong declensions (depending on the strength of the noun), these split again into all four cases, both singular and plural. Comparative adjectives (e.g. bigger) always add 're.' Example: √Ü√∞elen (noble), √¶√∞elenre (nobler). ===Verbs=== Verbs can be conjugated from the infinitive into the present tense, the past singular, the past plural and the past participle. There exist strong and weak verbs in Mercian that too conjugate in their own ways. The future tense requires an auxiliary verb, like will (Mercian wyllen). There are three moods: indicative, subjunctive and imperative. Like most inflected languages, Mercian has a few irregular verbs (such as 'to be' bƒìon and 'have' habben). For basic understanding, the four principal parts must be known for each strong verb: weak verbs are easier and more numerous, they all form the past participle with -ed. ===Vocabulary=== Mercian vocabulary is largely inherited from Proto-Germanic, with Latin loanwords coming via the use of Latin as the language of the Early Church, and Norse loanwords that arrived as part of the Norse incursions and foundation of the Danelaw which covered much of the midlands and north of England. ==See also== *AB language (a written Middle English dialect) *Mercia (disambiguation) * Wiktionary's coverage of Mercian terms ==References== *Biddulph, Joseph (2004) The Mercian Language: Introduction to the English Midlands Dialect of Late Anglo-Saxon and Early Middle English. 56 p.

It concerns a young recluse (Bud Cort, as the title character) who lives in a fallout shelter of the Houston Astrodome, where he is building a pair of wings so he can fly. He is helped by his comely and enigmatic \\"fairy godmother\\", played by Sally Kellerman, as he becomes a suspect in a series of murders. The film was shot on location in Houston, Texas. During the opening credits, shots of the downtown Houston skyline (with One Shell Plaza under construction) zoom toward the Houston Astrodome and Astrohall, with the emerging Texas Medical Center in the background. It was the first film shot inside the Astrodome. ==Plot== The film opens with the MGM logo, as usual, but with a voice-over saying, \\"I forgot the opening line\\" (the voice of James Stewart), replacing the lion roar, and proceeds with The Lecturer regaling his unseen students with a wealth of knowledge of the habits of birds. Owlish Brewster McCloud, living hidden and alone under the Houston Astrodome, dreams of creating wings that will help him fly like a bird. His only assistance comes from Louise, a beautiful woman who wants to help. Wearing only a trench coat, Louise has unexplained scars on her shoulder blades, suggestive of a fallen angel. She warns him against having sexual intercourse, as this could kill his instinct to fly. While Brewster works to complete his wings and condition himself for flight, Houston suffers a string of unexplained murders, the work of a serial killer whose victims are found strangled and covered in bird droppings. Haskell Weeks, a prominent figure in Houston, pulls strings to have the Houston Police call \\"San Francisco super cop\\" Frank Shaft to investigate. Shaft immediately fixates on the bird droppings and soon finds a link to Brewster. Brewster eludes the police with the apparent help of Louise but he eventually drives her away‚Äîand dooms himself‚Äîwhen he ignores her advice about sex by hooking up with Astrodome usher Suzanne Davis. Suzanne saves Brewster by evading Shaft in her stolen Road Runner. Severely injured after losing Brewster, Frank kills himself. Brewster eventually confesses his responsibility in the killings to Suzanne, who betrays him to the police. A small army of Houston policemen enter the Astrodome, but fail to nab Brewster before he takes flight using his completed wings. Although Brewster escapes the police, he cannot escape a human being's inherent unsuitability for flight. Exhausted by the effort, he falls out of the air, crashing in a heap on the floor of the Astrodome. The film ends with a Circus entering the Astrodome, played by the cast of the film, costumed as clowns, strongmen and other circus performers. The Ringmaster (played by William Windom) announces the names of each cast member, finishing with Brewster, who remains crumpled on the floor. ==Cast== * Bud Cort as Brewster McCloud * Sally Kellerman as Louise * Michael Murphy as Detective Frank Shaft * William Windom as Haskell Weeks * Shelley Duvall as Suzanne Davis * Ren√© Auberjonois as The Lecturer * Margaret Hamilton as Daphne Heap * Corey Fischer as Officer Hines * Stacy Keach as Abraham Wright * John Schuck as Officer Johnson * Bill Adair as detective * Bert Remsen as Officer Breen * Jennifer Salt as Hope * G. Wood as Captain Crandall * Dean Goss as Officer Ledbetter * William Baldwin as Bernard * Ronnie Cammick as Wendel * Marilyn Burns as Tour Guide ==Cultural references== The film features references to other films, including those of Fellini and to Altman's own work. Altman pays homage to Bullitt (1968) through the character of San Francisco detective Frank Shaft. Character Haskell Weeks' name resembles that of Haskell Wexler, a cinematographer Altman admired and considered working with on California Split. Visual references to The Wizard of Oz (1939) are suggested in the film: for example, Margaret Hamilton, who played the Wicked Witch of the West, appears wearing ruby slippers. Hope (Jennifer Salt), who supplies Brewster with health food, resembles Dorothy, with her distinctive gingham dress, pigtails and basket. At the end of the film, Hope is shown in the cast as Dorothy, carrying Toto. ==Production== This film marks the first feature produced by Altman's Lion's Gate Films. The film records landmarks and streetscapes that later were demolished or radically changed. For instance, the hotel Frank Shaft checks into was once part of the Astrodome complex, and has gone through several significant changes subsequently. ==Reception== Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and, comparing it to MASH, wrote that it was \\"just as densely packed with words and action, and you keep thinking you're missing things. You probably are. It's that quality that's so attractive about these two Altman films. We get the sense of a live intelligence, rushing things ahead on the screen, not worrying whether we'll understand.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded three out of four stars and wrote, \\"Once again Altman has taken a story (this time a rather weak one) and given it a distinctive spirit and flavor thru casting, cinematic devices and odd juxtapositions. An Altman film, if two can make a genre, appears to be more of a mood than a story. This rarely works, but it does for him.\\"Siskel, Gene (December 22, 1970). \\"'Brewster' & 'Lobo'\\".

One commonly used measure of nucleotide diversity was first introduced by Nei and Li in 1979. This measure is defined as the average number of nucleotide differences per site between two DNA sequences in all possible pairs in the sample population, and is denoted by \\\\pi. It is given by the formula: : \\\\pi = \\\\sum_{ij} x_i x_j \\\\pi_{ij} = 2 * \\\\sum_{i=2}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_i x_j \\\\pi_{ij} where x_i and x_j are the respective frequencies of the i th and j th sequences, \\\\pi_{ij} is the number of nucleotide differences per nucleotide site between the i th and j th sequences, and n is the number of sequences in the sample. Nucleotide diversity is a measure of genetic variation. It is usually associated with other statistical measures of population diversity, and is similar to expected heterozygosity. This statistic may be used to monitor diversity within or between ecological populations, to examine the genetic variation in crops and related species, or to determine evolutionary relationships. Nucleotide diversity can be calculated by examining the DNA sequences directly, or may be estimated from molecular marker data, such as Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) data and Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) data. ==Software== * DnaSP -- DNA Sequence Polymorphism, is a software package for the analysis of nucleotide polymorphism from aligned DNA sequence data. * MEGA, Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis, is a software package used for estimating rates of molecular evolution, as well as generating phylogenetic trees, and aligning DNA sequences.

There are a few variants and associated names for this idea: Mandel notation, Mandel‚ÄìVoigt notation and Nye notation are others found. Kelvin notation is a revival by Helbig of old ideas of Lord Kelvin. The differences here lie in certain weights attached to the selected entries of the tensor. Nomenclature may vary according to what is traditional in the field of application. For example, a 2√ó2 symmetric tensor X has only three distinct elements, the two on the diagonal and the other being off-diagonal. Thus it can be expressed as the vector :\\\\langle x_{1 1}, x_{2 2}, x_{1 2}\\\\rangle. As another example: The stress tensor (in matrix notation) is given as :\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}= \\\\left[{\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\sigma_{xx} & \\\\sigma_{xy} & \\\\sigma_{xz} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_{yx} & \\\\sigma_{yy} & \\\\sigma_{yz} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_{zx} & \\\\sigma_{zy} & \\\\sigma_{zz} \\\\end{matrix}}\\\\right]. In Voigt notation it is simplified to a 6-dimensional vector: :\\\\tilde\\\\sigma= (\\\\sigma_{xx}, \\\\sigma_{yy}, \\\\sigma_{zz}, \\\\sigma_{yz},\\\\sigma_{xz},\\\\sigma_{xy}) \\\\equiv (\\\\sigma_1, \\\\sigma_2, \\\\sigma_3, \\\\sigma_4, \\\\sigma_5, \\\\sigma_6). The strain tensor, similar in nature to the stress tensor‚Äîboth are symmetric second-order tensors --, is given in matrix form as :\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon}= \\\\left[{\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\epsilon_{xx} & \\\\epsilon_{xy} & \\\\epsilon_{xz} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\epsilon_{yx} & \\\\epsilon_{yy} & \\\\epsilon_{yz} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\epsilon_{zx} & \\\\epsilon_{zy} & \\\\epsilon_{zz} \\\\end{matrix}}\\\\right]. Its representation in Voigt notation is :\\\\tilde\\\\epsilon= (\\\\epsilon_{xx}, \\\\epsilon_{yy}, \\\\epsilon_{zz}, \\\\gamma_{yz},\\\\gamma_{xz},\\\\gamma_{xy}) \\\\equiv (\\\\epsilon_1, \\\\epsilon_2, \\\\epsilon_3, \\\\epsilon_4, \\\\epsilon_5, \\\\epsilon_6), where \\\\gamma_{xy}=2\\\\epsilon_{xy}, \\\\gamma_{yz}=2\\\\epsilon_{yz}, and \\\\gamma_{zx}=2\\\\epsilon_{zx} are engineering shear strains. The benefit of using different representations for stress and strain is that the scalar invariance : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\epsilon} = \\\\sigma_{ij}\\\\epsilon_{ij} = \\\\tilde\\\\sigma \\\\cdot \\\\tilde\\\\epsilon is preserved. Likewise, a three-dimensional symmetric fourth-order tensor can be reduced to a 6√ó6 matrix. == Mnemonic rule == A simple mnemonic rule for memorizing Voigt notation is as follows: * Write down the second order tensor in matrix form (in the example, the stress tensor) * Strike out the diagonal * Continue on the third column * Go back to the first element along the first row. Voigt indexes are numbered consecutively from the starting point to the end (in the example, the numbers in blue). 180px ==Mandel notation== For a symmetric tensor of second rank : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}= \\\\left[{\\\\begin{matrix} \\\\sigma_{11} & \\\\sigma_{12} & \\\\sigma_{13} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_{21} & \\\\sigma_{22} & \\\\sigma_{23} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_{31} & \\\\sigma_{32} & \\\\sigma_{33} \\\\end{matrix}}\\\\right] only six components are distinct, the three on the diagonal and the others being off-diagonal. Thus it can be expressed, in Mandel notation, as the vector : \\\\tilde \\\\sigma ^M= \\\\langle \\\\sigma_{11}, \\\\sigma_{22}, \\\\sigma_{33}, \\\\sqrt 2 \\\\sigma_{23}, \\\\sqrt 2 \\\\sigma_{13}, \\\\sqrt 2 \\\\sigma_{12} \\\\rangle. The main advantage of Mandel notation is to allow the use of the same conventional operations used with vectors, for example: : \\\\tilde \\\\sigma : \\\\tilde \\\\sigma = \\\\tilde \\\\sigma^M \\\\cdot \\\\tilde \\\\sigma^M = \\\\sigma_{11}^2 + \\\\sigma_{22}^2 + \\\\sigma_{33}^2 + 2 \\\\sigma_{23}^2 + 2 \\\\sigma_{13}^2 + 2 \\\\sigma_{12}^2. A symmetric tensor of rank four satisfying D_{ijkl} = D_{jikl} and D_{ijkl} = D_{ijlk} has 81 components in three-dimensional space, but only 36 components are distinct. Thus, in Mandel notation, it can be expressed as : \\\\tilde D^M= \\\\begin{pmatrix} D_{1111} & D_{1122} & D_{1133} & \\\\sqrt 2 D_{1123} & \\\\sqrt 2 D_{1113} & \\\\sqrt 2 D_{1112} \\\\\\\\\\\\ D_{2211} & D_{2222} & D_{2233} & \\\\sqrt 2 D_{2223} & \\\\sqrt 2 D_{2213} & \\\\sqrt 2 D_{2212} \\\\\\\\\\\\ D_{3311} & D_{3322} & D_{3333} & \\\\sqrt 2 D_{3323} & \\\\sqrt 2 D_{3313} & \\\\sqrt 2 D_{3312} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sqrt 2 D_{2311} & \\\\sqrt 2 D_{2322} & \\\\sqrt 2 D_{2333} & 2 D_{2323} & 2 D_{2313} & 2 D_{2312} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sqrt 2 D_{1311} & \\\\sqrt 2 D_{1322} & \\\\sqrt 2 D_{1333} & 2 D_{1323} & 2 D_{1313} & 2 D_{1312} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sqrt 2 D_{1211} & \\\\sqrt 2 D_{1222} & \\\\sqrt 2 D_{1233} & 2 D_{1223} & 2 D_{1213} & 2 D_{1212} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}. ==Applications== The notation is named after physicist Woldemar Voigt & John Nye (scientist). It is useful, for example, in calculations involving constitutive models to simulate materials, such as the generalized Hooke's law, as well as finite element analysis, and Diffusion MRI. Hooke's law has a symmetric fourth-order stiffness tensor with 81 components (3√ó3√ó3√ó3), but because the application of such a rank-4 tensor to a symmetric rank-2 tensor must yield another symmetric rank-2 tensor, not all of the 81 elements are independent. Voigt notation enables such a rank-4 tensor to be _represented_ by a 6√ó6 matrix. However, Voigt's form does not preserve the sum of the squares, which in the case of Hooke's law has geometric significance. This explains why weights are introduced (to make the mapping an isometry). A discussion of invariance of Voigt's notation and Mandel's notation can be found in Helnwein (2001). ==References== ==See also== * Vectorization (mathematics) * Hooke's law Category:Tensors Category:Mathematical notation Category:Solid mechanics ","title":"Voigt notation"},{"id":"1436676","text":" L√â Cliona was a in the Irish Naval Service. She was named after Cliodhna, an ancient Irish goddess of love; she was the former Bellwort was built by George Brown & Co of Greenock, Scotland. After wartime service in the Royal Navy she was handed over to the Naval Service on 3 February 1947 and commissioned Cliona by Lieutenant Walter J. Reidy the same day. She was sold to Haulbowline Industries for scrap and was removed to Passage West on 4 November 1970. ==Fire incident== On 29 May 1962, Cliona was participating in an annual exercise south off Roches Point. Cliona had a press party including a number of RT√â cameras embarked to do some filming for the new national broadcaster. The ship initially carried out a successful Hedgehog mortar exercise. During her second pattern of depth charges, she suffered a premature explosion from a charge dropped from the port stern rail. The resulting explosion lifted the stern of the ship out of the water and the concussion ruptured fuel oil feed pipes in the after boiler room. The leaking oil resulted in a serious fire which rapidly accelerated out of control. Stoker William Mynes closed the feed valves, isolating the supply of fuel to the fire. Mynes had to be ordered to leave his post so he could receive medical attention for burns he had sustained in the fire fighting effort. The Executive Officer, Lt. Pat O'Mahoney, then entered the aft boiler room where he fought the fire for at least another thirty minutes. The fire was eventually extinguished, despite the Marine Rescue Coordination centre dispatching an oceangoing tugboat, Clonmel to the scene to assist, Cliona was able to proceed to Haulbowline under her own steam for an investigation and repairs. At the time, neither Mynes or O'Mahoney were recognised for the bravery they showed in their fire fighting effort.Report to the Chief of Staff from Captain Thomas McKenna on fire damage to LE Cliona, 31 May 1962 (National Military Archives) However, 'scrolls of commendation' were issued in recognition of the crew member's efforts some decades later. ==References== Category:1941 ships Category:Former naval ships of the Republic of Ireland Category:Flower-class corvettes of the Naval Service (Ireland) Category:Cl√≠odhna ","title":"L√â Cliona (03)"},{"id":"1436685","text":"Stratford International is a National Rail station in Stratford and a separate Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station nearby, located in East Village in London and within the Greater London metropolitan area. Despite its name, no international services call at the station; plans for it to be served by Eurostar trains never came to fruition. The National Rail platforms are, however, served by domestic Southeastern trains on the High Speed 1 route originating at St. Pancras, with interchange to Eurostar trains at either Ebbsfleet or Ashford. On the DLR it is a terminus ‚Äì one of seven end of the line termini ‚Äì for local services via . Construction of the National Rail station was completed in 2006 but it only opened in 2009, for Southeastern services on HS1. In 2011 an extension of the DLR was opened to connect Stratford International to the wider London public transport network and to the main Stratford station to the south. The DLR station is physically separate and across the road from the HS1 station. Oyster cards and contactless payment cards are valid for travel to and from Stratford International, with the DLR station in Travelcard zone 2/3, but special fares apply at the HS1 station. The four-platform HS1 station is built within \\"Stratford Box\\", a concrete-sided cutting, meaning the station is located below ground level. It is located near the centre of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, adjacent to the Westfield Stratford City shopping centre. ==Background== High Speed 1 station concourse The station is on the High Speed 1 railway between and . As the station lies just inside the eastern boundary of the London Olympic Park, much of the surrounding land was little more than a construction site until mid-2012. The tracks descend into tunnel at both ends of the station as its platforms are closer to the surface than the tunnels; some of the platforms have a noticeable dip along their length at the east end. Stratford International has four platforms in the station box: two at the outer edges and two shorter ones forming a central island. The main line through tracks run down each side of the station between the adjacent platforms. There is a waiting room on the island platforms but not on the outer platforms. 35 metres beyond the eastern portals, the tunnels pass just below the Central line tunnels curving north from Stratford. The bottom invert of each Central line tunnel is only and above the high-speed running tunnels. The station was not authorised by the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996 and an order under the Transport and Works Act 1992 had to be made to allow for its construction. In the centre of the station is a single-track inclined viaduct, rising to the east end along and above the length of the island platforms. This is to allow out-of-service trains to leave the station box and reach the depot at Temple Mills. ==Services and connections== ===National Rail=== Southeastern operate all trains serving the High Speed 1 station. The full service started on 13 December 2009 using Class 395 multiple units. The typical off-peak service is: * 4tph (trains per hour) to St Pancras International (taking 7 minutes) * 2tph to * 1tph to via Ashford International and * 1tph to via Ashford International There are 1 or 2 international trains per hour in each direction that pass through without stopping. The peak hour service is 19 trains arriving at St Pancras between 07:00 and 09:59. The typical off-peak service will be: * 4tph (trains per hour) to St Pancras International (taking 7 minutes) * 2tph to with 1 continuing to Ashford via Ramsgate and Dover * 1tph to via Ashford International and * 1tph to via Ashford International continuing to Gravesend via Ramsgate and Faversham. During the 2012 Olympic Games, a service of eight trains an hour ran between St Pancras and Ebbsfleet, calling at Stratford, replacing the high speed service. Two of these would be extended to Ashford and one to Faversham. Between 11pm and 1am the service between St Pancras and Ebbsfleet would be increased to twelve per hour. To enable the domestic services to stop at platforms previously designed for Eurostar trains the platforms had to be raised. ===Docklands Light Railway=== DLR station soon after opening in 2011 The Docklands Light Railway extension to Stratford International consists of a short new line from Stratford International to Stratford station, then continues along the former North London Line route between and , stopping at Stratford High Street (on the site of the original Stratford Market railway station), Abbey Road, and Star Lane before joining the existing DLR branches from Canning Town to Woolwich Arsenal. Its opening was originally planned for July 2010, but was delayed to 31 August 2011. ===Bus services=== London Bus routes 97, 108, 308, 339 and night route N205 serve the station. ==International services== The original intended purpose of Stratford International station was to act as the London stop for regional Eurostar trains bypassing St Pancras and continuing to other destinations in Britain. However, these services did not come into being, and Rob Holden, chief executive of LCR and deputy chairman of Eurostar, stated that, \\"stopping a high-speed train seven minutes out of St Pancras is less than ideal\\", leaving only the domestic Southeastern trains serving the station. Critics derided the station as a white elephant. By the time Southeastern was serving the station, the Transport Secretary Lord Adonis was urged by Sir Robin Wales, former Mayor of Newham, and Peter Miller, Westfield Stratford City's CEO, to order Eurostar to stop at the station.Make Eurostar stop at Stratford International, ministers urged Evening Standard. Rob Lydall 17 February 2010 John Burton, development director of Westfield's Stratford City mall, said domestic services were a \\"poor substitute\\" for Eurostar: \\"International commuters are essential in order to realise the vision of a major metropolitan centre for east London. Direct international services will be a key part of the legacy of the Olympics.\\"Stratford needs Eurostar, warns boss of Olympic mall Evening Standard. Ross Lydall, 9 September 2010 Miller and local politicians including former Mayor Ken Livingstone warned that international services would be vital for the success of the Stratford City scheme and the regeneration of East London. London Assembly member Andrew Boff has suggested that rail operators considering running international trains should be forced to stop at Stratford International as part of their High Speed 1 line access.News from Andrew Boff: Stratford International is white elephant, says Boff Greater London Authority, Andrew Boff 26 May 2010 However, Eurostar could not stop during the 2012 London OlympicsEurostar 'will not stop' at Stratford International BBC News. Accessed 25 May 2010 because of the high frequency of the Javelin service. There are several other potential operators that may use the station for International services including Deutsche Bahn's proposed London-Frankfurt service. ==Access and interchange== Access to the station was, at design stage, to be via a new link road to Waterden Road, which linked in turn to the A12 at Lea Interchange and south to Carpenters Road. This link road was constructed and a new signal junction installed on Waterden Road but never opened. However, these roads were stopped up in mid-2007 to enable the construction of the Olympic Park. When opened it was located adjacent to the construction sites of both the London Olympic Park and Westfield Stratford City shopping centre which prevented pedestrian access; during local redevelopment work a temporary bus service linked Stratford International to nearby Stratford. The DLR station opened on 31 August 2011, and Westfield Stratford City on 13 September 2011. The bus service ran until 20 September.Stratford International details, nationalrail.co.uk, accessed 14 September 2011 archive ==References== Category:Docklands Light Railway stations in the London Borough of Newham Category:Railway stations in the London Borough of Newham Category:Railway stations opened by Network Rail Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 2009 Category:Railway stations served by Southeastern Category:Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park Category:Stratford, London ","title":"Stratford International station"},{"id":"1436690","text":"First Nation Operated Schools in Manitoba and the rest of Canada are schools that are funded by the Government of Canada. In accordance with the Treaty arrangements between the federal government and most individual First Nations, First Nation Operated Schools must be administered by locally elected School boards, and operate outside the direct control of the local Chief and Band Council. While there is no legislative requirement that Band Operated Schools follow Provincial Curricula, or adhere to the Manitoba Public Schools Act, or the Manitoba Education Administration Act, most First Nation Operated Schools do operate very closely to the way all Provincial Schools operate for the benefit of their students. By following Provincial Curricula, their students can more readily transfer from a Federal school to a Provincial school, and First Nation Operated Schools are able to retain High School Accreditation, so that their Secondary Graduates are recognized by Post-Secondary Institutions. The most noticeable difference between First Nation Operated Schools and Provincial Schools is in the absence of professional organizations such as The Manitoba Teachers' Society(MTS). Of the fifty-one First Nations Communities that operate Federal Schools, only two have teachers who are members of the Provincial Union, which all other public school teachers are automatically members of under the Public Schools Act and Education Administration Act.

However, over the past couple of years the magazine veered more towards the mainstream film press, with the notable change being its cover policy: initially Hotdog covers were often illustrations or images of cult, historical or alternative characters from film, referenced within that issue in one way or another, but towards the end of its life - along with a new, glossy cover material - this changed to the more standard practice of putting the current star of the moment there instead. This was largely a decision imposed by management for commercial reasons; veiled (or not so veiled) references to the magazine staff's displeasure at the practice can be found in several issues. ==History== The magazine was originally published by I Feel Good Ltd, before being sold to Paragon Publishing in 2002. Paragon was bought by Highbury House Communications PLC in 2003, becoming first Highbury-Paragon and later Highbury Entertainment. Following Highbury House's financial collapse in 2005, the Highbury Entertainment magazines were sold off to various other companies, including Future Publishing and Imagine Publishing. Hotdog was sold to SMD Publishing in early 2006, who closed the magazine in November 2006. Media Week reported that SMD Publishing were to close the title unless a buyer could be found. Richard Olsen, managing editor, said, \\"Hotdog is an exceptional magazine, but not economically viable in its current form\\". In August 2009 Marketing Week announced that Hotdog Magazine had been acquired along with Front magazine by The Kane Corporation, an independent publishing company led by 24-year-old self made millionaire entrepreneur Dominic McVey and managing director of talent agency Money, Francis Ridley. No plans for Hotdog have been announced by The Kane Corporation, however on 7 February 2014 McVey announced his intention to close Front. ==Subscribers== Due to the rapid way in which the magazine closed and the circumstances of the staff, subscribers were not offered compensation by way of a transference or refund, without independently contacting Dovetail, the contracted subscription company. ==References== Category:Film magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Defunct magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Magazines established in 2000 Category:Magazines disestablished in 2006 Category:Magazines published in London ","title":"Hotdog (magazine)"},{"id":"1436726","text":"Sudharmono (EVO: Soedharmono; 12 March 1927 ‚Äì 25 January 2006) was an Indonesian politician and military officer. He served as its fifth vice president between March 1988 and March 1993. ==Early life== Sudharmono was born on 12 March 1927 in Gresik, now of East Java. He lost both his parents in the space of six months when he was only three. Sudharmono then went to live with his uncle, a scribe serving in the Regency of Jombang, East Java. As he grew up however, he would move around a lot, living with family from both his father's and his mother's side. Sudharmono had just completed Junior High School when Indonesia proclaimed its independence from the Netherlands in 1945. After deciding to drop out from any further education, Sudharmono assisted in collecting weapons from the Japanese troops in preparation of the formation of an Indonesian Army. As a result of this, he became the Commander of the Ronggolawe Division, a position which he held throughout the course of the Indonesian War of Independence against the returning Dutch troops. ==Career== After the Dutch retreated in 1949, Sudharmono completed his Secondary Education before going to Jakarta in 1952 to join the Military Law Academy. He completed the course in 1956 before serving in Medan, North Sumatra as an Army Attorney from 1957‚Äì1961. In 1962, Sudharmono received his degree in law after completing a course at Military Law University. After this, Sudharmono was appointed Chairman of the Central Government Personnel Orders Unit and provided administrative assistance to the Government. During the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation, President Sukarno formed the Supreme Operations Command (KOTI), which was a war command immediately under Sukarno's control. In 1963, Sudharmono joined KOTI and was given the role of Joint Centre Operations Member for the Supreme Operations ==The New Order== It was from this position that Sudharmono began his rise. In October 1965, Major General Suharto was appointed Army Commander and joined KOTI as its Chief of Staff. Suharto formed a relationship with Sudharmono during these tense times in Indonesian history and it was evident that Sudharmono earned Suharto's trust. On 11 March 1966, when Suharto received the Emergency Powers from Sukarno, Sudharmono was the one who reproduced copies of the letter to be distributed to other Military Officers. The next day, on 12 March 1966, Sudharmono was also the one to write the decree banning PKI. With Suharto's rise to power, KOTI was disbanded but Sudharmono's administrative skills and the trust that he had earned from Suharto ensured him a position in Suharto's administration. When Suharto became President in 1968, Sudharmono was named Cabinet Secretary as well as Chairman of the Economic Stability Council. In 1970, Sudharmono was moved from the position of Cabinet Secretary to the State Secretary, a position which allowed him to assist Suharto in the day-to-day running of the Government. Whilst State Secretary, Sudharmono also covered for other Ministers when they are unable to perform their duties; with short stints as Interim Information Minister and Interim Home Affairs Minister as well as helping to produce Suharto's accountability speech before the People Consultative Assembly (MPR) General Session. In 1980, Sudharmono's position as State Secretary received a significant boost through a Presidential Decision which gave the State Secretary the power to supervise Government purchases exceeding 500 Million Rupiahs. ==Chairman of Golkar== By the 1980s, Sudharmono had proved his loyalty to Suharto and had also shown that he does not have any ambitions. At the 1983 Golkar Congress, with Suharto's support, Sudharmono was elected as the Chairman of Golkar. As Chairman, Sudharmono conducted many inspection tours of Golkar branches in the regions. Sudharmono also initiated a membership drive to get more voters to Golkar, an initiative that paid dividends in the 1987 Legislative Elections when Golkar's votes increased from 64% to 73%. The 1987 Legislative Elections was also a historical one for Golkar as it emerged victorious in the Province of Aceh for the first time. ==Vice Presidency== ===Nomination controversy=== As the MPR convened for its 1988 General Session, it was widely believed by many that Suharto (who was 67 years old) would be elected to his fifth and last term as President. With that in mind, the Vice Presidency became a crucial position. As 1988 began, Suharto began to show signs that he wanted Sudharmono to become his Vice President. Although never mentioning Sudharmono by name, Suharto said that he wanted his vice president to enjoy the support of a large socio-political force. The possibility of Sudharmono becoming Vice President displeased many in ABRI. Although Sudharmono had been an Army man himself and had ended his career with the rank of Lieutenant General, he had spent most of his career behind a desk instead of commanding troops. For this, he was looked down upon by ABRI. Suharto was aware of this and before ABRI could do anything, replaced Benny Moerdani with Try Sutrisno as ABRI Commander. This move crippled ABRI as Moerdani was more assertive when it comes to disagreeing with Suharto while Try, having been Suharto's aide-de-camp would be more passive. When the nomination was finally taken up through the official channels with Golkar, the Bureaucrats and Functional factions unanimously agreed to nominate Sudharmono as Vice President. The ABRI faction's nomination was delayed, with Moerdani continuing to procrastinate by claiming that he had not discussed the Vice Presidential nomination yet. It was said that he wanted Try to become the Vice President. At the 1988 MPR General Session in March 1988, controversy continued to dog Sudharmono's nomination as Vice President. First, Brigadier General Ibrahim Saleh interrupted the Session and was beginning to launch a scathing attack to Sudharmono before he was taken down from the podium by ABRI MPR members. Then Sarwo Edhie Wibowo, a General who had helped Suharto get to power in the mid-60's resigned from both his MPR and People's Representative Council (DPR) seat in protest. Finally, United Development Party Chairman, Jailani Naro nominated himself as Vice President, presumably with the private backing in ABRI, who in public supported Sudharmono's nomination. Suharto finally intervened. He cited a decision that the MPR made in 1973 that one of the criteria for a Vice President was that he should be able to work with the President. Suharto also conducted discussions with Naro and convinced him to withdraw the nomination. With Naro out of the way, Sudharmono was finally elected as Vice President. ===Term as Vice President=== Sudharmono and Vice President-elect Try Sutrisno at the 1993 session of the People's Consultative Assembly As Vice President, Sudharmono was extremely active. He regularly visited the Provinces and set up Mailbox 5000, a place where the people can send their suggestions and complains and the government. Sudharmono, ever the specialist in giving administrative assistance, was also given the duty by Suharto to supervise government bureaucracy. Despite this however, ABRI continued to show their displeasure at Sudharmono's election as Vice President. At the Golkar Congress in October 1988, ABRI got their revenge against Sudharmono when they secured the election of Wahono as the Chairman of Golkar. ABRI members were also responsible for a smear campaign which involved accusing Sudharmono as a communist. Finally in March 1993, to prevent having to deal with a Vice President that they did not like, ABRI nominated Try Sutrisno as Vice President without waiting for Suharto to make his choice. ===Possible President?=== Sudharmono as the State Secretary. In his book, Suharto: A Political Biography, Robert Elson theorized of the possibility of Sudharmono's Vice Presidency being the final step before the Indonesian Presidency itself and that Suharto only continued because of the reaction to Sudharmono's nomination There are two reasons for this: *1: As State Secretary, Sudharmono's duty was to assist the President in the day-to-day administration of the Government. Having held this position for 15 years prior to being elected Vice President, Sudharmono was sure to have been familiar with the inner workings of the Suharto regime. *2: ABRI would not have gone to extreme lengths to show their displeasure at Sudharmono being elected Vice President if they did not expect a long-term effect. ==Post-VP== In 1997, Sudharmono released his autobiography, Pengalaman Dalam Masa Pengabdian (Experiences During Time of Service). Concurrently, a book was also released called Kesan dan Kenangan dari Teman: 70 Tahun H. Sudharmono SH (Impressions and Memories from Colleagues: 70 Years of Sudharmono) which talked about Sudharmono from the point of view of those who he had worked with. Because the release of these books happened a year before the 1998 MPR General Session, there were rumors that Sudharmono was going to make a political comeback and aim for the Vice Presidency once again. In May 1998, on the eve of Suharto's fall, Sudharmono, together with former vice presidents Umar Wirahadikusumah and Try Sutrisno visited Suharto at his residence to discuss possible options. Sudharmono also continued to manage Suharto's Foundations (Yayasan). ==Death== Sudharmono died on 25 January 2006. His body was buried in the TMP Kalibata, Jakarta. ==Family== Sudharmono married Erma Norma, with whom he had five children. His last son has three children. ==Portrait== Sudharmono Official Portrait.jpgAnother Portrait Sudharmono as Vice President Sekretaris Kabinet Sudharmono.jpgPortrait as Secretary of Cabinet Sudharmono in military uniform.jpgPortrait in full military uniform ==See also== *List of Vice Presidents of Indonesia ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Bio at Ensiklopedi Tokoh Indonesia * Article on ABRI's reluctance to nominate Sudharmono as Vice President * profile on Tokoh-indonesia.com Category:1927 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Vice Presidents of Indonesia Category:People from Gresik Regency Category:People from Jombang Regency Category:Deaths from respiratory failure Category:Indonesian generals Category:Javanese people Category:Golkar politicians ","title":"Sudharmono"},{"id":"1436729","text":"Steering Oar The steering oar or steering board is an over-sized oar or board, to control the direction of a ship or other watercraft prior to the invention of the rudder.

These mascot characters can perform some useful functions such as checking e-mail or adjusting the clock of the computer, but are most popular as an aesthetic add-on, which ‚Äúsays‚Äù weird things. Characters are typically cute anime girls of original design, accompanied by a small monster or pet of some sort. However, a variety of other subjects exist on the sidelines, from video game characters to 2channel memes to humorous depictions of Hitler. ==Surface, shell, ghost== Most importantly, the characters ‚Äútalk‚Äù (in Japanese). What they ‚Äúsay‚Äù is shown in a speech bubble. Also, they have variable facial expressions (called ‚Äúsurfaces‚Äù). For example, they might say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 3. Are you still awake?‚Äù at 3:00. Or, when the user is rebooting, they might say ‚ÄúOh, are you rebooting? Okay, Seeya.‚Äù But usually, the two chat to each other, and the user can read their conversations (in the balloons). The contents of their conversations are usually hilarious, ironic, silly, or possibly erotic. Those lines (called ‚Äúfake-AI talk‚Äù) are program generated, and the personality of the character (called ‚Äúghost‚Äù, in its narrow sense) depends on this conversation-generating program (called ‚Äúshiori‚Äù). The character‚Äôs appearance is called shell, which is implemented as several surfaces. A set of the ‚Äúmain‚Äù girl and her companion is vaguely called a ghost (‚Äúghost‚Äù in its broad sense). As of August 8, 2006, 1617 kinds of ghosts are listed on the Ghost Center. Usually, a different ghost has a different shell. In order for the ghost not to repeat the same conversations (which would be boring), the user can update the data via the Internet. Additionally, if the user permits, they can talk according to a remote script (which is written in the language called ‚ÄúSakura Script‚Äù). In that case, it is also possible that two or more users chat to each other using the Ukagaka system. The protocol it uses to communicate with other (local or remote) programs is called SSTP (Sakura Script Transfer Protocol). Ports 7743 and 9801 are officially assigned by IANA for SSTP. The port 7743 is not actually used for this protocol. The original Ukagaka listens to port 9801 while SSP (see below) uses the port 9821 by default. Most ghosts are highly otaku-oriented; hence, even if the user is a native Japanese speaker, he or she probably does not fully understand what they are talking about, unless they are an otaku to a significant degree. Not always, but in many cases, they are chatting to each other assuming the user (that is, the reader) is very familiar with the games released by Leaf and by Key. Also note that, in many cases, Uny≈´ does not speak standard Japanese, but speaks the Osaka dialect (as often as not it is a fake Osaka dialect made up by a non-Osaka dialect speaker). Ukagaka is, in a narrow sense, a platform on which any standard-compliant ghost runs. There are a few Ukagaka-compatible platforms, such as SSP (Sakura Script Player) and CROW. Many users prefer SSP to the original Ukagaka, whose development has been stalled. Ukagaka, or its compatible platform, usually comes with its default ghost. It is possible and usual to have more than one ghost on the same platform, when the ghosts are switchable (that is, the girl the user selected from the menu appears on the user‚Äôs desktop). An additional ghost, including its shell, is usually provided as a single .nar (Nanika Archive) file, which the user can easily install by dragging and dropping onto the running shell. ==Shiori== Basically, each ghost has its own personality, talking differently about different topics. This means that each ghost has its own shiori (a conversation-generating module). However, it is not easy to implement a shiori from scratch. Usually, middleware is used to make it easy to create a new ghost. KAWARI is open- source software used frequently for this purpose. ==Internationalization== Although it is not well documented, it is basically easy to create a ghost that speaks a language other than Japanese. Also, it is possible to change the menu language of SSP into English, but since SSP is just a platform, changing the menu language does not change the language the ghost speaks. ==See also== *Nanika *Kisekae Set System ==External links== In Japanese: *SSP, a popular Ukagaka program for Windows *Nanika Ghost Center, a database of 'ghosts' *Niseringo, an Ukagaka program for Mac OS X *ninix-aya, a Ukagaka program for UNIX *GHOST TOWN, a repository of ghost characters Category:Desktop environments ","title":"Ukagaka"},{"id":"1436742","text":"Beverley Owen (n√©e Ogg; May 13, 1937February 21, 2019) was an American television actress, best known for having played the original role of Marilyn Munster on the sitcom The Munsters before the role was taken over by Pat Priest. ==Early life== Beverley Jane Ogg was born on May 13, 1937, in Ottumwa, Iowa.

Usually this is done by assigning at least a latitude and longitude to the image, and optionally altitude, compass bearing and other fields may also be included. In theory, every part of a picture can be tied to a geographic location, but in the most typical application, only the position of the photographer is associated with the entire digital image. This has implications for search and retrieval. For example, photos of a mountain summit can be taken from different positions miles apart. To find all images of a particular summit in an image database, all photos taken within a reasonable distance must be considered. The point position of the photographer can in some cases include the bearing, the direction the camera was pointing, as well as the elevation and the DOP. ==Methods== There are a few methods of geotagging photographs, either automatic or manual. Automatic methods provide the easiest and most precise method of geotagging an image, providing that a good signal has been acquired at the time of taking the photo. ===Automatic using a built-in GPS=== Several manufacturers offer cameras with a built-in GPS receiver, but most cameras with this capability are camera phones as camera manufacturers after initial experience in the market came to treat GPS cameras as a niche market.New York Times Gadgetwise 2010/07/28 Why don't more cameras offer GPS? The 2008 Nikon P6000, for example, an early geotagging camera, was replaced in 2010 by the P7000 which lacked that feature.CNET UK Nikon says No to GPS Some models also include a compass to indicate the direction the camera was facing when the picture was taken. * Canon EOS 6D * Canon PowerShot SX280HS * Canon PowerShot S100 * Fujifilm FinePix F550EXR * Fujifilm FinePix F770EXR * Nikon COOLPIX P330 * Nikon COOLPIX P6000 * Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ10 * Panasonic Lumix DMC- TZ40 * Sony Alpha 55V (DSLR) * Some mobile phones with assisted GPS use the cell phone network to speed GPS acquisition times. ===Automatic using a connected GPS=== Geotagger \\"Solmeta N2 Compass\\" + Nikon D5000 The D1X and D1H that Nikon introduced in 2002 included a GPS interface.http://www.nikonsupport.eu/europe/Download/Other%20Downloads/gps_instructions.pdf In 2006 the first special GPS receiver for Nikon was produced by Dawntech.http://gps-camera.eu/wissen/29-hardware/202-die-anfaenge-unser- erstes-dawntech-di-gps.html Since 2009 Nikon has sold its own Geotagger GP-1. Canon uses the USB socket on the wireless file transmitter unit (WFT) as the GPS interface. Some digital cameras and camera phones support an external GPS receiver connected by cable, or inserted into the memory card slot or flash shoe. The Samsung SH100 can connect using Wi-Fi to get position data from a GPS-enabled smartphone. Generally the relevant GPS data is automatically stored in the photo's Exif information when the photo is taken. A connected GPS will generally remain switched on continuously, requiring power, and will then have location information available immediately when the camera is switched on. Many GPS-ready cameras are currently available, made by manufacturers such as Nikon, Fujifilm, Sony and Panasonic. Automatic geotagging combined with real-time transfer and publishing results in real- time geotagging. ===Synchronizing with a separate GPS=== Most cameras sold today do not contain a built-in GPS receiver; however, an external location- aware device, such as a hand-held GPS logger, can still be used with a non-GPS digital camera for geotagging. The photo is taken without geographical information and is processed later using software in conjunction with the GPS data. Timestamps made by the camera can be compared with timestamps in the recorded GPS information, provided that the clocks in the separate devices can be synchronized. The resulting coordinates can then be added to the Exif information of the photo. ===Manual geotagging=== Location information can also be added to photos, for example via its Exif specification that has fields for longitude/latitude, even if no GPS device was present when the photo was taken. The information can be entered by directly giving the coordinates or by selecting a location from a map using software tools. Some tools allow entry of tags such as city, postal code or a street address. Geocoding and reverse geocoding can be used to convert between locations and addresses. Manual geotagging also introduces possibilities of error, where a photograph's location is incorrectly represented by wrong coordinates. An advanced comparative analysis of such photos with the total collection set of all photos available from the surrounding coordinates, needs to be done to single out and flag such photos, but such a software's value, need and purpose could be limited in today's environment where almost every smartphone and camera have geotagging built-in and users do not need to manually enter this information. ===Remote standoff capture=== Screenshot from a U.S. Customs and Border Protection Predator UAV, showing the GPS position of the aircraft (red) and the target (blue) Some manufacturers of military and professional mapping- grade GPS instruments have integrated a GPS receiver with a laser rangefinder and digital camera. These multi-functional tools are able to determine a remote subject's GPS position by calculating the subject's geographic location relative to the camera's GPS position. These instruments are commonly used in military applications when an aircraft or operator is targeting an area, the position is inaccessible (for example over a valley or wetland), there are personal health & safety concerns (motorway traffic), or the user wants to quickly capture multiple targets from a single, safe position (trees, street signage and furniture). Civilian integrated GPS cameras with rangefinders and remote standoff capability are currently available made by manufacturers such as Ricoh and Surveylab. ==Uses== When geotagged photos are uploaded to online sharing communities such as Flickr, Panoramio or Moblog, the photo can be placed onto a map to view the location the photo was taken. In this way, users can browse photos from a map, search for photos from a given area, and find related photos of the same place from other users. Many smartphones automatically geotag their photos by default. Photographers who prefer not to reveal their location can turn this feature off.US Army Additionally smartphones can use their GPS to geotag photos taken with an external camera. Geotagged photo location stamped with GPStamper Geotagged photos may be visually stamped with their GPS location information using software tools. A stamped photo affords universal and cross-platform viewing of the photo's location, and offers the security of retaining that location information in the event of metadata corruption, or if file metadata is stripped from a photo, e.g. when uploading to various online photo sharing communities. Geotagging is also being used to determine social patterns. For example, Now app uses geotagged Instagram photos to find nearby events happening now.https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/11/now-app/ ==Formats== With photos stored in JPEG, TIFF and many other file formats, the geotag information, storing camera location and sometimes heading, is typically embedded in the metadata, stored in Exchangeable image file format (Exif) or Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) format. These data are not visible in the picture itself but are read and written by special programs and most digital cameras and modern scanners. Latitude and longitude are stored in units of degrees with decimals.In this format, a positively signed coordinate indicates Northern or Eastern hemisphere, while negative sign indicates Southern or Western hemisphere. This geotag information can be read by many programs, such as the cross-platform open source ExifTool. An example readout for a photo might look like: GPS Latitude : 57 deg 38' 56.83\\" N GPS Longitude : 10 deg 24' 26.79\\" E GPS Position : 57 deg 38' 56.83\\" N, 10 deg 24' 26.79\\" E or the same coordinates could also be presented as decimal degrees: GPS GPS Longitude : 10.40744 GPS Position : 57.64911 10.40744 When stored in Exif, the coordinates are represented as a series of rational numbers in the GPS sub-IFD.

First appearing in The Flash #123 (1961), Earth-Two was created to explain differences between the original Golden Age and then-current Silver Age versions of characters such as the Flash, and how the current (Earth-One) versions could appear in stories alongside earlier versions of the same character concepts. Earth-Two includes DC Golden Age heroes, including the Justice Society of America, whose careers began at the dawn of World War II, concurrently with their first appearances in comics. Earth-Two, along with the four other surviving Earths of the DC Multiverse, were merged into one in the 1985 miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths. However, following the events of Infinite Crisis, the Multiverse was reborn, although the subsequent Earth-Two was not the same as its pre-Crisis equivalent. Following the events of Flashpoint, the setting was revised once again, and was now identified as \\"Earth 2\\" (instead of \\"Earth Two\\" or \\"Earth-Two\\"). While it still houses a team of superheroes, its membership is younger than before. Earth 2 also has a tragic backstory, having been invaded by a horde of alien invaders from Apokolips five years prior to the reboot, ahead of Darkseid's attempted invasion of Prime Earth. In the process, this reality's Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman all died, while its Supergirl and Robin were swept through a dimensional warp to Prime Earth where they became known as Power Girl and Huntress. == Publication history == === Introduction (\\"Flash of Two Worlds\\") === The Flash #123 (September 1961). Art by Carmine Infantino and Murphy Anderson. Characters from DC Comics were originally suggestive of each existing in their own world, as superheroes never encountered each other. This was soon changed with alliances being formed between certain protagonists. Several publications, including All Star Comics (publishing tales of the Justice Society of America), Leading Comics (publishing tales of the Seven Soldiers of Victory) and other comic books introduced a \\"shared universe\\" among several characters during the 1940s. By the 1950s, as the popularity of superheroes was waning, comics shifted to horror, westerns and war. Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman were among the few DC continued to publish. Beginning in the early 1960s, the popularity of superheroes began to grow. DC introduced more modern versions of its heroes. For example, Hawkman was an alien policeman instead of a reincarnated Egyptian prince. Older versions of DC characters were assigned to an \\"alternative reality\\" Earth that existed within its own fictional \\"universe\\" and could communicate with the Earth of the current, revised versions of those characters. Alternative-reality Earths had been used in DC stories before, but were usually not referred to after that particular story. Most of these alternative Earths were usually so vastly different that no one would confuse that Earth and its history with the so- called real Earth. That would change when the existence of another reliable Earth was established in a story titled \\"Flash of Two Worlds\\" in which Barry Allen, the modern Flash later referred to as the Flash of Earth-One (the setting of the Silver Age stories) first travels to another Earth, accidentally vibrating at just the right speed to appear on Earth-Two, where he meets Jay Garrick, his Earth-Two counterpart. He claims Gardner Fox's dreams were tuned into Earth-Two, explaining their depiction as a fictional world in earlier Barry Allen stories. === Expanding the concept: revisiting 40s superheroes === Superman was introduced in the 1930s and was the archetype for the modern superhero, and so is depicted in stories set on Earth-Two as the first major reliable costumed superhero on that world, discounting earlier part-time heroes and \\"mystery men\\" such as Dr. Occult. Most of the following costumed mystery men history is based on the Earth-Two Superman's initial appearance, where these previously independent operating heroes begin to reliably interact. In order to distinguish him from the later primary version of the character, this Superman was called \\"Kal-L\\", using the spelling of Superman's Kryptonian name in his early appearances. He was specifically introduced as an Earth-Two character in Justice League of America #73 (1969). Most superheroes from the Golden Age later followed this trend of operating publicly, while wearing distinctive costuming and interacting in a largely shared universe. The primary characters of Superman and Batman still largely worked independent of team environments. In the 1970s, as the now annual team up between the Justice League of America and the Justice Society of America had proven popular, DC published the then present day adventures of the Justice Society in the revived All-Star Comics with issue 58, resuming the numbering from the series original run. The story continued in Adventure Comics #460- 465, which featured the death of the Earth-Two Batman. Mr and Mrs Superman, a feature in Superman Family (1974‚Äì1982), featured stories of the adventures of married Superman and Lois Lane of Earth-Two. These stories were set at a time in which the Superman of Earth-Two was at a similar age to the then-present-day Superman of Earth-One. In the 1980s, DC published All-Star Squadron which covered the war time history of various superheroes during World War II. Infinity, Inc., a group made up of the children and heirs of the Justice Society, was introduced in All-Star Squadron #25 (September 1983). There was an eponymous comics series starring the group,Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 207: \\"Written by DC's Golden Age guru Roy Thomas and drawn by Jerry Ordway, Infinity, Inc. was released in DC's new deluxe format on bright Baxter paper.\\" which ran from March 1984 through June 1988. === Abandonment: Crisis on Infinite Earths === Crisis on Infinite Earths (1985‚Äì1986) was an effort by DC Comics to clean up their continuity, resulting in the multiple universes combining into one. Since then, a handful of characters originating from Earth-Two have consistently remained part of the merged Earth, including Power Girl, Jay Garrick, and Alan Scott. Superman and Lois Lane from Earth-Two (along with Superboy from Earth Prime, and Alexander Luthor, Jr. from Earth- Three) were transported into a ghost-like \\"paradise dimension\\" tangential to the new universe. Following the end of the known Multiverse, more alternate realities were discovered. Even though Earth-Three was destroyed in the Anti- Monitor's anti-matter wave attacks, a new Crime Syndicate (called the \\"Crime Syndicate of Amerika\\") developed in the antimatter universe of Qward, which was very different in background and power base from the pre-Crisis Earth- Three group, though same in the number of members. After the Kingdom event, Hypertime and divergent realities were revealed, but never supposed to be accessed, as stated in the Zero Hour event. They were later revealed when a directly-parallel Flash (Walter West aka the \\"Dark Flash\\") entered the mainstream DC Universe and threatened to destroy it. These alternate realities are usually addressed as \\"Elsewhere\\" and \\"Elseworld\\" stories. === Reviving the Multiverse: Infinite Crisis === thumb Kal-L, Lois Lane-Kent, Superboy-Prime, and Alexander Luthor returned during Infinite Crisis. Unknown to Kal-L, Luthor's plan was to resurrect the pre-Crisis Multiverse. He wanted to mix and match elements from each reality to create a \\"perfect world\\". The fallout of the conflict brought the short-lived return of an Earth-Two copy and the deaths of Kal-L, Lois Lane-Kent and Luthor Jr. of Earth-Two. It is unclear what happened to the aged Diana Trevor, the Earth-Two Wonder Woman, though she faded from her ghostly existence. Inexplicably, Earth-Two was the only returning world that was devoid of most people, except the Justice Society, Kal-L, and his wife Lois Kent. This world was a copy, new and recently manufactured by Alexander Luthor, Jr. of pre-Crisis Earth-Three, instead of resurrected. This copy Earth-Two was recombined with the primary Earth to form the primary DC reality termed as \\"New Earth\\". ====Post-52 version==== New Earth-2 from 52 Week 52, art breakdowns by Keith Giffen. At the end of the Infinite Crisis limited series, the realigned world is called \\"New Earth\\". In the final issue of the 52 weekly series, it is revealed that fifty-two duplicate worlds have been created and all but New Earth have been altered from the original incarnation. The post-Crisis Earth-2 made its first appearance in a single panel of 52 Week 52 where it resembled the pre-Crisis Earth-Two, where a newspaper article says that this world's Superman and Power Girl are missing. The Flashes of New Earth (Jay Garrick and Wally West) briefly glimpsed this world with Robin and Huntress in action (during their travel with the Cosmic Treadmill as shown in Justice Society (vol. 3) #11) and Monarch selected Jay Garrick of this Earth (amongst others) in a Multiversal arena tournament. Based on comments by 52 co-writer Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-Two. This separation between the pre-Crisis Earth-Two and post-Crisis Earth-2 is formally established in Justice Society of America Annual #1 (2008), with a story titled \\"Earth 2 Chapter One: Golden Age\\", in which the New Earth Power Girl arrives on post- Crisis Earth-2. Thinking that she has returned home to her long destroyed pre- Crisis Earth-Two. Power Girl crash lands and unconscious, on the closest parallel of the 52 Multiverse, the post-Crisis Earth-2, which appears similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-Two. She is found by the post-Crisis Earth-2 Huntress, who thinks she is her long-missing best friend, the Power Girl native to this world. In this new reality, the Justice Society of America has merged with Infinity, Inc. and is now known as Justice Society Infinity. Initially, Power Girl believes she has returned home, until the missing post-Crisis Earth-2 Power Girl reappears and declares that the other Power Girl is an impostor, and has caused the disappearance of the post-Crisis Earth-2 Superman. This turn of events results in the post-Crisis Earth-2 Power Girl and the Justice Society Infinity to go after the New Earth Power Girl. The Power Girl of New Earth recruits the post-Crisis Earth-2 Michael Holt, who is a physics professor and father and has never become a costumed hero, to help her return to her source Earth. Holt constructs a device similar to the Cosmic treadmill used by Barry Allen to open a portal to New Earth. The Power Girl of New Earth returns home, followed by the Justice Society Infinity, who kidnap her and take her back to post-Crisis Earth-2. During the confrontation, Green Lantern and Jade are initially confused when they see each other, as the post-Crisis Earth-2 Jade's father, Alan Scott, is dead, and New Earth's Jade is dead as well. The JSI interrogate Power Girl for information on the post-Crisis Earth-2 Superman's whereabouts. The post-Crisis Earth-2 Power Girl assumes that the Superman the New Earth Power Girl said was dead was the post-Crisis Earth-2 Superman (rather than Kal-L who was killed by Superboy-Prime) and that the New Earth Power Girl had killed him. The Justice Society of New Earth arrives to stop her torture. Starman reveals that the re-creation of the Multiverse led to the creation of a Power Girl and Superman native to this new universe, post-Crisis Earth-2 and that the post-Crisis Earth-2 Superman is still alive. The Power Girl of New Earth then returns home along with her Justice Society but with no apology from her counterpart nor from the post- Crisis Earth-2 Huntress for their actions against her. === Earth 2 in \\"The New 52\\" === In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the Earth-2 concept has been revived and is covered in two series; Worlds' Finest, which focuses on the adventures of the Huntress and Power Girl on New Earth written by Paul Levitz, and Earth 2, originally written by James Robinson and then by Tom Taylor, which features the formation of the Justice Society. James Robinson, the original writer of Earth 2, describes the new Earth 2 as a complete reboot of the concept, with superheroes only just now appearing, similar to the \\"young hero\\" concept for the New 52 continuity, and with revamped costume designs. In Earth 2, Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Catwoman seemingly gave their lives in order to repel the Apokoliptan invasion, leaving behind a world with no heroes. Supergirl and Robin (Helena Wayne) end up stranded in the mainstream universe towards the end of the invasion. When the Earth-2 Solomon Grundy threatens the world, three new heroes team up to defeat him: the Flash (Jay Garrick), Hawkgirl (Kendra Saunders), and Green Lantern (Alan Scott). In later issues, Mister Terrific (Michael Holt) from the mainstream universe joins the team. Other heroes who have made appearances include Dr. Fate (Khalid Ben-Hassin), the Atom (Al Pratt, now nuclear-powered), the Sandman (Wesley Dodds), Mister Miracle, and Big Barda. Villains include Solomon Grundy, a now-villainous Terry Sloan, Wotan, Steppenwolf and what was thought to be a surviving, Darkseid- brainwashed Superman, which turned out to be a very powerful but genetically unstable Bizarro-type clone. Writer James Robinson left the series with issue #16 and Tom Taylor became the new writer at #17. Other new characters introduced as the series progresses include a female Red Tornado (with the consciousness of Lois Lane), a hyper-intelligent knowledge-assimilator known as Accountable (Jimmy Olsen), a new Batman (Thomas Wayne#Earth-2 using Miraclo), a new version of Aquawoman (Marella), and a new Superman (Val-Zod, a Kryptonian and a childhood friend of Power Girl's who had been imprisoned by Terry Sloan). Towards the end of the series, Darkseid launches a second invasion of Earth, which is depicted in both Earth 2 and the weekly series Earth 2: World's End. Another weekly series, The New 52: Futures End, depicts a possible future in which refugees from a destroyed Earth 2 come to Earth 0 and prompt society to fracture. Over the course of the series, several new characters are introduced, such as Yolanda Montez, an Avatar of the Red who is a counterpart of Alan Scott; a second Red Arrow, an Earth 2 equivalent of Oliver Queen; Ted Grant, a former boxer; and Dick Grayson, a journalist who goes on a mission to find his son after his wife Barbara Gordon is killed during the invasion. Others change alignment; Wonder Woman and Steppenwolf's daughter Fury sides with Mister Miracle and the other heroes after Big Barda reveals her loyalty to Darkseid. Huntress and Power Girl return to Earth 2 as well to take part in a mad scramble to save the Earth and then later, to save its people along with a computerized record of human culture and life on Earth created by Bruce Wayne. In Earth 2: World's End #11, it is revealed that Highfather made a deal with Darkseid that he would not interfere with Darkseid's plans for conquest so long as Darkseid only preyed upon one Earth of the Multiverse, which was Earth 2, explaining the recurrent tragedies faced by this world in comparison to others. In the end, Darkseid is successful, and the Earth is destroyed, and attempts to take Earth 2's refugees to Earth 0 are prevented by a time travelling Tim Drake in Futures End. Just as the world ends, several of the Wonders are sent to the planet Telos by Brainiac, where they confront their counterparts from various parallel worlds, both present and extinct, in the Convergence miniseries. Over the course of the series, Batman dies and Dick Grayson, inspired by his Batman counterparts from other worlds, takes up the mantle from Thomas Wayne. Ultimately, the planet Telos is terraformed into a new Earth-like planet and sent to the Earth 2 dimension as a new home for its refugees. The heroes' fraught attempts at forming a new society, rapidly augmented by Terry Sloan's technology, is depicted in the follow-on series Earth 2: Society (August 2015 ‚Äì March 2017). It also debuts versions of Hourman and Mist. The final arc of the series recreates Earth 2 again making it appear similar to their universe's first Earth through use of an Amazon artifact known as Pandora's Casket by Ultra-Humanite. This Earth has had no history of Wonders with Ultra-Humanite controlling the world behind the scenes. Following Ultra-Humanite's defeat, the Wonders becomes the world's new defenders and hopes that this Earth is the Earth they can protect. At the end of Doomsday Clock #12 (2019), Doctor Manhattan reverses the actions that created the \\"New 52\\" universe, restoring Alan Scott and the Justice Society's original full histories as before Flashpoint, and the original Earth-Two is explained as existing in the multiverse too. == Characters == A number of characters, heroes and villains, had counterparts on both Earth-One and Two. Generally speaking, the older Earth-Two versions were phased out or incorporated into their younger, Earth-One versions following Crisis on Infinite Earths. Several others were rebooted almost entirely, with their new versions having nothing in common with the old ones. For instance, Jim Corrigan of Earth-Two was a murdered police detective who served as the human host for the Spectre, while his Earth-One counterpart was a Metropolis police officer who often assisted Daily Planet cub reporter Jimmy Olsen and superhero Black Lightning. Many characters would often travel from one Earth to the other and interact with its natives or even immigrate. For example, Larry Jordan, the first Air Wave and native of Earth-Two, traveled to Earth-One under yet-unexplained circumstances, married Helen (the second Air Wave) and raised a son, Hal (the third Air Wave). == Unique features == The history of Earth-Two is slightly different from both real world history and the history of other versions of Earth from DC Comics stories. For example, in classic Earth-Two stories, by the 1970s, Quebec is shown to be an independent nation autonomous from Canada. South Africa abolished apartheid sooner than in the real world. The fictional countries of Dukalia, Luxor, Napkan, Nastonia, Oxnalia, Thornia and others existed on the Axis side in WW2 (though most of these disappeared when the US entered the war). Unlike other DC Comics depictions of Atlantis, the Atlantean countries of Poseidonis and Tritonis were ruled by a queen, not a king (along with its inhabitants displaying surface dweller features and no capacity for underwater survival, as the Atlantis continent had been raised). In addition, masked crimefighters are introduced decades earlier than in other universes later identified within DC Comics, and these participated in such historic conflicts as World War II. Franklin Delano Roosevelt founded both the Justice Society of America and the All-Star Squadron. Other events taking place decades earlier include the destruction of Krypton and the advent of advanced technology such as interstellar transportation and time travel. Thousands of years ago, the Guardians of Earth-One's Universe expelled the vast majority of magic from their universe, sending it to Earth-Two. This resulted in a predominance of magic and a weakening of scientific laws within Earth-Two's universe. == Variants == Because Earth-Two as presented did not match up with the actual comics of DC's Golden Age, other alternative Earths were used to explain the discrepancies. Earth-Two-A (also known as Alternate Earth-Two) was where Clark Kent worked for the Daily Planet under editor Parry White in the 1940s and 1950s (on regular Earth-Two Kent worked for the Daily Star, his editor was George Taylor, and Perry White was a reporter). Earth-Two-B (aka Earth-Forty- Six) is a world referenced but not described in the Crisis On Infinite Earths: Absolute Edition. Earth-E (Earth-216) is the world where the Super-Sons adventures happened and was used to explain 1950s Batman and Superman stories that didn't fit with either Earth-One or Earth-Two history. Mark Gruenwald assigned it to the 1951‚Äì1960 period of those books. == In other media == === Television === * The season 3 episode \\"Tempus Anyone?\\" in Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, time traveler and author H.G. Wells takes the Lois Lane from Earth-One to a parallel universe Metropolis where there is a Clark Kent, but no Superman. Here, she inspires him to become the Man of Steel to that world. She also runs into familiar faces in unfamiliar roles: Jimmy Olsen is now James Olsen, owner of the Daily Planet; Perry White is running for Mayor; Clark Kent is engaged to High School sweetheart Lana Lang (who is keeping him from using his powers); she also realizes that the Lois Lane of that world died a few years earlier when she came upon her tombstone. Needless to say, by the end of the episode, Earth-Two Clark Kent embraces his destiny as Superman, but loses his identity as Clark. Earth-Two Clark later arrives in Earth-One during the season 4 episode \\"Lois and Clarks\\". This occurs after another encounter with Tempus that has the Earth-One Man of Tomorrow locked away in a moment of time that threatens to erase him from existence. * The Earth-Two of the Smallville series appears in Season Ten episode \\"Luthor\\". Resembling the Post Crisis Earth-3, this Earth-2 is a dark offshoot-universe where Clark was found and raised by Lionel Luthor instead of Martha and Jonathan Kent and helped him take control of the world by creating an alternative non costumed identity known as Ultraman. This reality works as a mirror world where the counterparts are totally different from those that exist in the Earth-1 (such as Oliver Queen not being Green Arrow but instead Lois' disgruntled fianc√©e, and an angry Jonathan Kent farming his home for gold meteor rock to buy back his home). The only known way to access it is through the Kryptonian Mirror box, but Lionel escaped to Earth-1 to resume his dead counterpart's position as Luthorcorp, while Clark destroyed the box. Clark Luthor reappears in \\"Kent\\" where his Mirror box makes an appearance sending Clark to Earth-2, but destroyed it, seeking asylum in Earth-1 as everyone knows how to kill him and sees Tess Mercer as an ally. With the help of Emil Hamilton repairing the Earth-2 box, he and Tess used it to bring back Clark. * Another version of Earth-Two appears in the TV series set in the Arrowverse: ** Earth-Two is first featured in season 2 of The Flash, though originally as an analogue of the comic books' Earth-3. While possessing similarities to the 'Prime' Earth, this Earth-Two had several marked differences. The architecture, clothing fashions, and entertainment outlets were mixtures of contemporary 21st century and 1940s styles. Furthermore, certain areas of science and technology were far more advanced than on Earth- One. In addition, people in this Earth-Two are typically opposite in personality and circumstances compared to their Earth-One doppelgangers. For instance, Caitlin Snow on Earth-One originally didn't possess the metahuman gene and is a kind, soft-spoken person whereas her Earth-Two counterpart is an amoral criminal named Killer Frost who has ice-generating powers. Iris West Allen is not a reporter on this world; instead, she is a police detective whose father, Joe West, (a cop on Earth-One) is a nightclub singer (this aspect is similar to that depicted on the Earth shown in JLA: Earth 2). Other Earth-2 counterparts involve Barry Allen as a CSI operative, Cisco Ramon as Zoom's enforcer Reverb, Ronnie Raymond as Killer Frost's husband Deathstorm who never takes Martin Stein's advice, Robert Queen as the Hood after Oliver died in the Queen's Gambit shipwreck, Henry and Nora Allen living a happy life, Linda Park operating as Doctor Light, Leonard Snart being the Mayor of Central City, David Singh as a criminal, Quentin Lance is dead, Laurel Lance as Zoom's lieutenant Black Siren, and Dante Ramon as the supervillain Rupture. The two Earths were originally connected through a wormhole created by Eobard Thawne/\\"Harrison Wells\\" (the Prime Earth Reverse-Flash) in the season 1 finale; demonstrated by the appearance of the Earth-Two Flash's helmet. When the singularity is finally collapsed, the explosion opens 52 breaches throughout Central City that allow passage between the two worlds, though only by speedsters or through technological means. Doppelgangers from Earth-Two begin appearing on Earth-One after being forcibly brought by Zoom, a criminal speedster. Zoom directs metahumans such as Atom-Smasher, King Shark, Sand Demon, and other such followers into killing the Earth-One Flash or be stranded on Earth-One forever. Jay Garrick and the Harrison Wells of Earth-Two arrive separately to help Team Flash with the criminal metahumans and to defeat Zoom. ** Earth-Two of The Flash is referred to in the Supergirl crossover episode \\"Worlds Finest\\". As Barry is explaining the multiverse to Kara and her friends, Winn asks about a possible Earth \\"where all of us are evil\\". Barry replies \\"Been there. It sucks\\", referring to the Earth-Two he has visited (\\"Welcome to Earth-2\\" and \\"Escape from Earth-2\\"). ** In season 6 of Arrow (from which The Flash spun out of), Black Siren resurfaced and allied with criminals Cayden James and Ricardo Diaz before defecting to Green Arrow's side. In the episode \\"Starling City,\\" it is revealed that Moira Queen is remarried to Malcolm Merlyn, Thea Queen died from an overdose of the Vertigo drug, Tommy Merlyn operated as Dark Archer, Dinah Drake is a police sergeant who is on Tommy's side, Rene Ramirez is Malcolm Merlyn's head of security who is also on Tommy's side, Adrian Chase is now the Hood, and a variation of Bruce Wayne existed here. However, Earth-Two is destroyed as part of a lead-up to the Arrowverse's take on the DC comics event Crisis on Infinite Earths. ** In the epilogue of Crisis on Infinite Earths following the multiverse's rebirth, a new Earth-Two was created in place of the previous Earth-Two. This Earth-Two has the events of the TV series Stargirl taking place within it. === Video games === * An Earth 2 skin pack was released as downloadable content for Injustice: Gods Among Us. It included alternate skins for the Flash, Hawkgirl, and Solomon Grundy based on the appearances of Jay Garrick, Kendra Saunders and Grundy in New 52. * A pre-order skin pack for Batman: Arkham Origins video game includes two Earth 2 skins for Batman, both based on the New 52. One depicts the original Batman Bruce Wayne and the other depicting the new black-and-red Batman Thomas Wayne. == References == == External links == * * *Earth 2 at Mike's Amazing World of Comics Category:1961 in comics Category:DC Comics dimensions Category:DC Comics planets Two ","title":"Earth-Two"},{"id":"1436756","text":"Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of the Russian SFSR located on the Crimean Peninsula. ==History== It was created on October 18, 1921, as the Crimean Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic of the Russian SFSR.

Before Kalla declared himself as the running mate for Joko Widodo in the 2014 presidential election, a 2012 poll placed his popularity among likely voters in the top three contenders for the presidency and ahead of his own party's nominee Aburizal Bakrie. He is the first person to hold two non-consecutive terms as Vice President of Indonesia. Since 2009 Kalla serves as the chairman of the Indonesian Red Cross Society. ==Early life== Kalla was born on 15 May 1942 in Watampone, now sits in South Sulawesi. His parents were Hadji Kalla, a local businessman and Athirah, a woman who sold Buginese silk for a living.Jusuf Kalla, Petinggi Negara yang Sederhana  Biografi  Ensiklopedi Tokoh Indonesia He was the second of 10 children. After completing school, Kalla attended Hasanuddin University in Makassar. At university he became active in the Indonesian Student Action Front (KAMI), a student organization which supported General Suharto in his bid to gain power from president Sukarno. Kalla was elected as chair of South Sulawesi branch of KAMI. He showed interest in a political career, becoming a member of the Regional People's Representative Council (DPRD) and chairman of the Youth Division of Golkar when it was still organised under a Joint Secretariat (Sekretariat Bersama or Sekber) format. ==Businessman== In 1967 Kalla graduated from the Economics Faculty at Hasanuddin University. The economic situation was bleak at the time and his father, Hadji Kalla, considered shutting down the family business, NV Hadji Kalla. Instead, Kalla decided to take over the firm. Putting aside his political activities, in 1968 Kalla became CEO of NV Hadji Kalla while his father became chairman. In the beginning the business only had one employee and business was slow. Kalla's mother assisted by trading silk and running a small transportation business with three buses. Over time the business grew and became quite successful. NV Hadji Kalla expanded from the export-import trading business into other sectors (hotels, infrastructure construction, car dealerships, aerobridges, shipping, real estate, transportation, a shrimp farm, oil palm, and telecommunications). In addition to being CEO of NV Hadji Kalla, Kalla was also CEO of various subsidiaries of the firm. In 1977, Kalla graduated from INSEAD, an international business school in Fontainebleau, south of Paris. \\"NV Hadji Kalla\\" is now known as the Kalla Group and is one of the leading business groups in Indonesia, especially in Eastern Indonesia. ==Affiliations== Aside from his business career, Kalla has been active in numerous well-known organizations. From 1979 to 1989, he was chairman of the Indonesian Economics Graduates Association (ISEI) in Makassar (known as Ujung Pandang at the time) and continues to be an adviser for ISEI. Kalla was extensively involved with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN). From 1985 to 1998 he was chairman for KADIN in South Sulawesi and was coordinator for KADIN in eastern Indonesia. In addition, Kalla is on the board of trustees for three universities in Makassar. Kalla has contributed socially by building the Al Markaz Mosque and becoming chairman of its Islamic centre. In 2015, the Jusuf Kalla School of Government at Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta was established, with the school being funded by Kalla. Kalla is seen in The Act of Killing film praising Pancasila Youth and encouraging them to commit violence. ==Political career== ===Member of the People's Consultative Assembly=== Kalla returned to active politics in 1987 when he was appointed to the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) as a regional representative for South Sulawesi. He was re-appointed to the MPR in 1992, 1997, and 1999.Yayasan API, Panduan Parlelem Indonesia (Indonesian Parliamentary Guide), Jakarta, ===Wahid and Megawati Presidency=== When Kyai Haji Abdurrahman Wahid (often known as Gus Dur) was elected as president by the MPR in 1999, Kalla was included in the cabinet and became Minister of Industry and Trade. He had only been a minister for six months when in April 2000 Wahid removed him along with the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises. Wahid accused both Kalla and minister Laksamana of corruption, although he never produced evidence to support the charge, and Kalla denied the allegations. In July 2001, at a special session of the MPR, President Gus Dur was dismissed from office. Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri took over the presidency and included Kalla in her cabinet, appointing him to the senior post of Coordinating Minister of People's Welfare. Although it was not part of his ministerial brief, Kalla helped solve the inter-religious conflict in Poso on his native island of Sulawesi. Kalla facilitated the negotiation which resulted in the signing of the Malino II Accord on 20 December 2001Deklarasi Malino Mengakhiri Pertikaian di Poso. Tempointeraktif.com (20 December 2001). and an end to the conflict which had gone on for three years. Two months later, Kalla helped solve another conflict in Sulawesi. On 12 February 2002, Kalla, together with Coordinating Minister of Politics and Society Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, managed to solve a similar conflict on Ambon and Molucca through a second Malino Declaration.Eskol-Net]\\\\- Hot Spot: \\"Deklarasi Malino untuk Maluku\\" ===Road to Vice Presidency=== Now a popular figure for assisting with the peace process in Sulawesi, Kalla considered putting himself forward as a candidate in the 2004 presidential elections. In August 2003 he announced his candidacy and enlisted as a participant in Golkar's 2004 Convention which would choose the Golkar candidate for president.Rimanews . Nasional Rimanews. As the months went by, however, Kalla came to be seen more as a vice presidential candidate. He was expected to partner a Javanese presidential candidate and his non-Javanese background was seen as a means of attracting non-Javanese votes which a Javanese candidate might have trouble getting.Nasional . Suara Merdeka. Just days before the Golkar national convention, Kalla decided to withdraw from running under the Golkar banner. Rather, he accepted the offer from the Democratic Party's (PD) Yudhoyono to become his running mate. The pair also received the support of the Crescent Star Party (PBB), the Indonesian Justice and Unity Party (PKPI), and Reform Star Party (PBR). On 5 July 2004 the presidential election was held. Yudhoyono and Kalla won the popular vote with 33% of the votes but 50% of votes is required for election as president and vice president so a run-off was required. Yudhoyono and Megawati proceeded to the second election round held later in the year. In the second ground Yudhoyono faced a considerable challenge from Megawati who formed a national coalition consisting of her own Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle (PDI-P) along with Golkar, the United Development Party, the Prosperous Peace Party (PDS), and the Indonesian National Party (PNI). Whilst Yudhoyono consolidated political support from other parties, Kalla turned to Golkar for support. Led by Fahmi Idris and ignoring the party line, pro-Kalla elements in Golkar declared their support for Kalla and Yudhoyono.Tempo Interaktif On 20 September 2004 Yudhoyono and Kalla won the run-off with 60.1% of the vote. ===First vice-presidential term=== Official portrait of Kalla's first VP term Although he had overwhelmingly won the Presidency, Yudhoyono was still weak in the People's Representative Council (DPR). PD with all of its coalition partners were still too weak to contend with the legislative muscles of Golkar and PDI-P who now intended to play the role of opposition. With a National Congress to be held in December 2004, Yudhoyono and Kalla had originally backed head of DPR Agung Laksono to become Golkar Chairman. When Agung was perceived to be too weak to run against Akbar, Yudhoyono and Kalla threw their weight behind Surya Paloh. Finally, when Paloh was also perceived to be too weak to run against Akbar, Yudhoyono gave the green light for Kalla to run for the Golkar Chairmanship.Nasional . Suara Merdeka. On 19 December 2004, Kalla was elected as the new Chairman of Golkar. Kalla's victory posed a dilemma for Yudhoyono. Although it now enabled Yudhoyono to pass legislation, Kalla's new position meant that in one sense, he was now more powerful than Yudhoyono. The first sign of rivalry came during the Indian Ocean tsunami when Kalla, apparently on his own initiative, assembled the ministers and signed a vice presidential decree ordering work to begin on rehabilitating Aceh. The legality of the Vice Presidential decree was questioned although Yudhoyono maintained that it was he who gave the orders for Kalla to proceed. Jusuf Kalla with Russian President (then Prime Minister), Vladimir Putin The second sign was in September 2005 when Yudhoyono went to New York to attend the annual United Nations Summit. Although Yudhoyono had left Kalla to take charge of proceedings at Jakarta, he seemed to be bent on maintaining a watch on matters at home. Yudhoyono would hold a video conference from New York to receive reports from ministers. Critics suggested that such conduct was an expression of distrust by Yudhoyono The suggestion seemed to gain momentum when Kalla only showed up for one video conference and then spent the rest of the time taking care of Golkar matters. Although things calmed down, especially with Golkar gaining another cabinet position in the reshuffle, the alleged rivalry surfaced again in October 2006 when Yudhoyono established the Presidential Work Unit for the Organization of Reform Program (UKP3R). Critics questioned whether the establishment of the unit was an attempt by Yudhoyono to exclude Kalla from the government. Yudhoyono was quick to clarify that in supervising UKP3R, he would be assisted by Kalla.Presiden SBY: UKP3R Dipertahankan  Berita Tokoh Indonesia ===Potential presidential candidacy in 2014=== Kalla has been often mentioned as a possible nominee of the Golkar Party in the 2014 presidential race. In 2009 Kalla ran in the Indonesian presidential election with former Armed Forces Chief of Staff Wiranto as his running mate, finishing third with 12.4% of the vote. During a dedication ceremony of the Indonesian Red Cross headquarters in the Riau province on 3 February 2012 Kalla stated his willingness to run in the presidential election in 2014 should he receive sufficient public support. By May 2012 however, Kalla stated that he had no intention of running in the 2014 Presidential election. Kalla said he had no hard feelings about party chairman Aburizal Bakrie's upcoming inauguration as presidential candidate for the Golkar Party and that he had no intention of competing with him despite surveys that showed that Kalla was likely to be more electable than Bakrie. During Golkar's National Leadership meeting in Bogor on 29 June 2012, Bakrie was officially declared the Golkar Party's 2014 Presidential candidate. Nevertheless, in the changeable political scene in Indonesia the situation can be expected to evolve in the preparations for the 2014 presidential election. In late 2012 Jusuf Kalla indicated that he would be prepared to move away from Golkar and join a ticket sponsored by the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) with former president Megawati as candidate for president and him as the vice-presidential candidate. \\"If I am not representing Golkar Party, then I have no objection ... Everything is possible in politics,\\" Kalla said.Rabby Pramudatama, 'Kalla ready to dump Golkar and be VP candidate for Megawati', The Jakarta Post, 26 November 2012. ===Jokowi's running mate=== Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP)'s presidential candidate Joko Widodo announced Jusuf Kalla as his vice presidential running mate at Gedung Juang, Jakarta, on 19 May 2014.Fikri Fakih, PDIP: Gedung Joeang Dipilih Karena Jokowi Memulai Orde Perjuangan, Merdeka.com, 19 May 2014 ===Second vice-presidential term=== First official portrait of Kalla's second VP term, used from 2014 to 2016. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence meeting with Kalla and Cabinet Ministers, 20 April 2017 During his second term as vice president, Kalla criticized neighbor nations Malaysia and Singapore for airing their concerns about suffering from the repeated haze caused by Indonesian forest fires, stating in March 2015: \\"For 11 months, they enjoyed nice air from Indonesia and they never thanked us. They have suffered because of the haze for one month and they get upset.\\" During the 2015 Southeast Asian haze crisis in September, Kalla restated a similar position, while further questioning \\"why should there be an apology\\" from Indonesia. It was also noted that Kalla had made similar comments between 2005 and 2007 during his first term of Vice Presidency. In what was interpreted as a response to Kalla, the Singaporean Minister for Foreign Affairs, K. Shanmugam, while noting that \\"PSI levels in parts of Indonesia are at almost 2,000\\", expressed disappointment at \\"shocking statements made, at senior levels, from Indonesia ... without any regard for their people, or ours, and without any embarrassment, or sense of responsibility\\". With Indonesia's pollution index by the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics declaring values over 350 to be \\"hazardous\\", it was reported on 22 September 2015 that the index in Palangkaraya in Central Kalimantan had hit 1,986. Later in September, Kalla insisted that Indonesia is \\"open\\", and requested that \\"Singapore, please come if you want to help. Don't just talk\\"; this was in spite of earlier rejections (in that month) by Indonesia of Singapore's offers of assistance. In November, Kalla said that the destruction of Indonesian forests was \\"not only our problem\\" as \\"foreign people\\" were also responsible. He scolded foreign companies, saying \\"You take [Indonesian products], and pay $5, and you bring it here, and sell for $100. Indonesian companies just get $5 ... you have to pay, if not we will cut down all the trees, and let the world feel the heat ... The world has to pay for all of this. Don't always accuse Indonesia.\\" He also reiterated that since Singapore and Malaysia did not thank Indonesia for \\"fresh air from Sumatra, Kalimantan\\", then there was no need for Indonesia to apologize for haze from Indonesian forest fires. In February 2016, Kalla told the United Nations Development Programme not to finance or carry out an LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) community program in Indonesia. Kalla previously stated opposition to LGBT campaigns in Indonesia, which he considered at that point as deviating from social values. In April 2016, Kalla reportedly criticized how Singapore, \\"never wants to sign\\" an extradition agreement with Indonesia, despite Singapore supposedly being the \\"country where the largest number of\\" Indonesian fugitives had fled. The Singaporean Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded by pointing out that an Indonesia-Singapore extradition treaty cum defence cooperation pact had been signed in 2007, while Kalla was also Vice President, but the treaty was still pending ratification by the Indonesian House of Representatives. The Indonesian House had rejected the dual agreement in 2013 as \\"not favourable to Indonesia\\", maintaining that \\"extradition and defence are two separate issues\\". In December 2018, the issue of China's Xinjiang re-education camps and human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim minority was brought up in parliament. Kalla said: \\"we don't want to intervene in the domestic affairs of another country.\\" ==Personal life== Kalla and his wife Kalla is married to Mufidah Miad Saad, with whom he has five children, Muchlisa, Muswira, Imelda, Solichin and Chaerani.Figur magazine, Edition XXIX/2008, p29, PT. Panca Wira Karsa, Jakarta, His career after the vice presidency has included many community activities. On 22 December 2009, he was elected as chairman of Indonesian Red Cross Society (Palang Merah Indonesia, PMI). Kalla said that under his leadership the PMI would build up stocks in the national blood bank to prepare for any increased demand for blood by hospital patients and victims of natural disasters.

He held the office from 11 March 1993 to 11 March 1998. Previously, he served as the Commander of the Republic of Indonesia Armed Forces for five years. == Early life == Try Sutrisno was born on 15 November 1935 in Soerabaia (Surabaya), now of East Java. His father, Subandi, was an ambulance driver, and his mother, Mardiyah, was a housewife. After the Indonesian Proclamation of Independence in 1945, the Dutch returned to reclaim Indonesia as their colony. Try and his family moved from Surabaya to Mojokerto. His father worked as a medical officer for the Poncowati Army Battalion, forcing Try to stop his schooling and make a living as a cigarette and newspaper seller. At age 13, Try wanted to join the Poncowati Battalion and fight, but no one took him seriously, and he ended up being employed as a courier. Try's duty was to find information on areas occupied by the Dutch Army as well as retrieving medicine for the Indonesian Army. Finally in 1949, the Dutch retreated and recognized Indonesia's independence. Try and his family then returned to Surabaya, where he completed his education in 1956. After graduating from high school, Try wanted to enlist in ATEKAD (Army Technical Academy, later merged into the Indonesian Military Academy or Akmil). He passed an entrance examination but then failed the physical examination. Despite this, Major General GPH Djatikusumo took interest in Try and summoned him back. Try participated in a psychological examination in Bandung, West Java, and was then accepted into the ATEKAD as a cadet. == Military career == === Early military career === Try's first Military experience was in 1957, when he fought against the PRRI Rebellion. The rebellion was led by a group of separatists in Sumatra wishing to establish an alternative Government to that of President Sukarno's. Try completed his military education in 1959, when he graduated from ATEKAD and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Indonesian Army. Try's early experience in the ABRI included stints in Sumatra, Jakarta, and East Java. In 1972, Try was sent to the Army Staff College (Seskoad). In 1974, Try was chosen to be President Suharto's adjutant. Suharto took a liking to Try and from then on, Try's military career would skyrocket. === KODAM XVI/Udayana and KODAM IV/Sriwijaya === In 1978, Try was appointed to the position of Regional Command Chief of Staff at KODAM XVI/Udayana. A year later, he would become the Regional Commander of KODAM IV/Sriwijaya, where he had started his career. As Regional Commander, Try moved to suppress the crime rate as well as stopping lead smuggling. He even participated in an environmental campaign to return Sumatran elephants to their natural habitats. === KODAM V/Jaya and Tanjung Priok Incident === In 1982, Try was appointed to the Regional Commander of KODAM V/Jaya and was stationed in Jakarta. 1984 would see the Government pass a law which required all organizations whether it be political or non- political to adopt the national ideology of Pancasila as the sole guiding principle (Azas Tunggal). It would also see Islamic dissent reached its peak as preachers began teaching against the adoption of Pancasila as the national ideology, what they perceived to be the Government's Christianization, the Government's family planning program, and the dominance of the Indonesian Economy by the Chinese Indonesian population. On 7 September 1984, Sgt. Hermanu, running on an inspection run in North Jakarta, came across a mosque with leaflets which asked for women to wear the hijab. This was a leaflet which encouraged Muslims who read it to defy the Government's policy of discouraging women from wearing the hijab. Sergeant Hermanu asked for the leaflets to be taken down but his orders were not followed. The next day, Hermanu returned and stuck papers washed in dirty water over the leaflets to cover it up. Somehow a rumor began going around that Hermanu had defiled the Mosque by going into the prayer hall without taking his shoes off. This caused a lot of outrage and Hermanu's motorbike was burned. The Army then returned to arrest the 4 youths who burned the motorbike. Over the next few days there were protests asking for the release of the 4 youths and preachers took advantage of the situation to preach against the Government. Finally on 12 September 1984, the crowd at Tanjung Priok began attacking shops owned by Chinese Indonesians as well as going after the headquarters of the North Jakarta District Military Command (KODIM). Try, together with ABRI Commander, Benny Moerdani agreed that troops should be deployed to contain the rioters. The riot continued to get worse, according to the soldiers, the mob refused to heed the warning shots and continued charging at them with machetes and sickles. Finally the troops were forced to open fire. The Government claimed that 28 people were killed but the victims continued to insist that around 700 were killed. This episode would continue to haunt Try for the rest of his career. === Deputy Army Chief of Staff and Army Chief of Staff === Try's career continued to advance. In 1985, he became Deputy Army Chief of Staff, before becoming the Army Chief of Staff himself in 1986. As Army Chief of Staff, Try started the Badan TWP TNI-AD (Army Compulsory Saving for Housing Body) to make it easier for Army soldiers to buy their own house. === ABRI Commander and Dili Massacre === Try finally reached the pinnacle of his Military career in 1988, when he was appointed ABRI Commander to replace Moerdani. As ABRI Commander, Try spent a lot of time putting down rebellions all around Indonesia. His immediate target was the separatists in Aceh, which he successfully suppressed by 1992. In 1989, there was the Talangsari incident, in which Try repeated his actions in 1984 by cracking down on Islamist protesters. In November 1991, in the then Province of East Timor, a group of students attending the funeral of a fellow student who had been shot dead by Indonesian troops took the opportunity to launch protests against the Indonesian occupation. At the funeral procession, students unfurled banners calling for self-determination and independence, displaying pictures of the independence leader Xanana Gusm√£o. As the procession entered the cemetery, Indonesian troops opened fire. Of the people demonstrating in the cemetery, 271 were killed, 382 wounded, and 250 disappeared. The incident, known as the Dili Massacre, provoked worldwide condemnation from the international community. Try said two days after the massacre: \\"The army cannot be underestimated. Finally we had to shoot them. Delinquents like these agitators must be shot, and they will be....\\".Quoted in Carey, p. 52. A slightly different wording (\\"...and we will shoot them\\") is quoted in Jardine, p. 17. Try was then invited to speak before the People's Representative Council (DPR) to explain himself. Try gave a defense of his decision and maintained that the protesters were provoking the soldiers and that claims that the protests were peaceful was \\"bullshit\\". Try was discharged from his position as ABRI Commander in February 1993. == Vice President == === Nomination === Try Sutrisno takes the oath of office on 11 March 1993 at a session of the People's Consultative Assembly. In February 1993, the same month that Try was discharged from his position and a month before the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) was due to meet to elect a new President and Vice President, MPR members from ABRI nominated Try to be the Vice President. Technically speaking, MPR faction members were allowed to nominate their candidates for Vice President. But the unwritten rule in Suharto's regime had been to wait for the President to nominate his chosen candidate. Members from the United Development Party and the Indonesian Democratic Party quickly approved of Try's nomination as Golkar struggled in telling its members that Golkar had not nominated Try as Vice President. Suharto was reportedly angry that he had been pre-empted by the armed forces but did not want an open dispute with its delegation in the assembly. Suharto finally accepted Try and Golkar tried to play down the pre-emption by saying it had let the other parties and ABRI nominate their Vice Presidential candidates. ABRI had gotten their revenge from the 1988 MPR General Session when Suharto chose Sudharmono, someone who the ABRI did not like as the Vice President. Defense Minister Benny Moerdani was determined that ABRI would choose a Vice President for Suharto in the 1993 MPR General Session. It was speculated that had he not been pre-empted, Suharto would have either elected B. J. Habibie as his Vice President or re- elected Sudharmono. === Vice Presidency === Although he had accepted Try as Vice President, Suharto's displeasure at having a Vice President he did not ask for shone through as ABRI members within the Cabinet were kept to a bare minimum. For Try himself, Suharto showed little regard and did not even consult him in the cabinet formation process. Another show of disregard came In late 1997 when Suharto had to go to Germany to receive health treatment. Instead of leaving Try to execute Presidential duties, Suharto ordered State Secretary Moerdiono to come to his residence to receive Presidential duties. == Post Vice Presidency == In May 1998, on the eve of Suharto's fall, Try, together with Umar Wirahadikusumah and Sudharmono visited Suharto at his residence to discuss possible options. In 1998, Try was elected to become the Chairman of the ABRI Veterans' Union (Pepabri). He successfully kept Pepabri united as one under his Chairmanship despite the prevalent mood at the time that each branch of the Armed Forces gets their own veterans' union. Try completed his term in this position in 2003. Try also served as Party Elder for General Edi Sudrajat's Justice and Unity Party. In August 2005, Try, together with Abdurrahman Wahid, Megawati Sukarnoputri, Wiranto, and Akbar Tanjung formed a forum called the National Awakening to Unity Movement (Gerakan Nusantara Bangkit Bersatu). This forum criticized Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's Government for its memorandum of understanding with the Free Aceh Movement (GAM). This was followed in September 2005 with a criticism of Yudhoyono's decision to raise fuel prices. Try somewhat softened his stance with the Government after a meeting with Vice President Jusuf Kalla in September 2005. Kalla was sent to explain the reasoning behind the policies taken towards GAM and raising fuel prices. At the end of the meeting, Try said that he can understand the Government's position and encouraged the people to back the Government in their decisions. == Family == Try is married to Tuti Sutiawati with whom he had 3 children and 4 grandchildren. ==Honour== ===Foreign honour=== * : Honorary Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (P.M.N.)

Clinical governance became important in health care after the Bristol heart scandal in 1995, during which an anaesthetist, Dr Stephen Bolsin, exposed the high mortality rate for paediatric cardiac surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary. It was originally elaborated within the United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS), and its most widely cited formal definition describes it as: > A framework through which NHS organisations are accountable for continually > improving the quality of their services and safeguarding high standards of > care by creating an environment in which excellence in clinical care will > flourish.Scally and Donaldson, 1998 This definition is intended to embody three key attributes: recognisably high standards of care, transparent responsibility and accountability for those standards, and a constant dynamic of improvement. The concept has some parallels with the more widely known corporate governance, in that it addresses those structures, systems and processes that assure the quality, accountability and proper management of an organisation's operation and delivery of service. However clinical governance applies only to health and social care organisations, and only those aspects of such organisations that relate to the delivery of care to patients and their carers; it is not concerned with the other business processes of the organisation except insofar as they affect the delivery of care. The concept of \\"integrated governance\\" has emerged to refer jointly to the corporate governance and clinical governance duties of healthcare organisations. Prior to 1999, the principal statutory responsibilities of UK NHS Trust Boards were to ensure proper financial management of the organisation and an acceptable level of patient safety. Trust Boards had no statutory duty to ensure a particular level of quality. Maintaining and improving the quality of care was understood to be the responsibility of the relevant clinical professions. In 1999, Trust Boards assumed a legal responsibility for quality of care that is equal in measure to their other statutory duties. Clinical governance is the mechanism by which that responsibility is discharged. \\"Clinical governance\\" does not mandate any particular structure, system or process for maintaining and improving the quality of care, except that designated responsibility for clinical governance must exist at Trust Board level, and that each Trust must prepare an Annual Review of Clinical Governance to report on quality of care and its maintenance. Beyond that, the Trust and its various clinical departments are obliged to interpret the principle of clinical governance into locally appropriate structures, processes, roles and responsibilities. ==Elements== Clinical governance is an aggregation of service improvement processes that are regulated by a single ideology. Clinical governance is composed of at least the following elements: *Education and Training *Clinical audit *Clinical effectiveness *Research and development *Openness *Risk management *Information Management ===Education and training=== It is no longer considered acceptable for any clinician to abstain from continuing education after qualification ‚Äì too much of what is learned during training becomes quickly outdated. In NHS Trusts, the continuing professional development (CPD) of clinicians has been the responsibility of the Trust and it has also been the professional duty of clinicians to remain up-to-date. ===Clinical audit=== Clinical audit is the review of clinical performance, the refining of clinical practice as a result and the measurement of performance against agreed standards ‚Äì a cyclical process of improving the quality of clinical care. In one form or another, audit has been part of good clinical practice for generations. Whilst audit has been a requirement of NHS Trust employees, in primary care clinical audit has only been encouraged, where audit time has had to compete with other priorities. ===Clinical effectiveness=== Clinical effectiveness is a measure of the extent to which a particular intervention works. The measure on its own is useful, but decisions are enhanced by considering additional factors, such as whether the intervention is appropriate and whether it represents value for money. In the modern health service, clinical practice needs to be refined in the light of emerging evidence of effectiveness but also has to consider aspects of efficiency and safety from the perspective of the individual patient and carers in the wider community. ===Research and development=== A good professional practice is to always seek to change in the light of evidence-led research. The time lag for introducing such change can be substantial, thus reducing the time lag and associated morbidity requires emphasis not only on carrying out research but also on efficiently implementing said research. Techniques such as critical appraisal of the literature, project management and the development of guidelines, protocols and implementation strategies are all tools for promoting the implementation of research practice. ===Openness=== Poor performance and poor practice can too often thrive behind closed doors. Processes which are open to public scrutiny, while respecting individual patient and practitioner confidentiality, and which can be justified openly, are an essential part of quality assurance. Open proceedings and discussion about clinical governance issues should be a feature of the framework. Any organisation providing high quality care has to show that it is meeting the needs of the population it serves. Health needs assessment and understanding the problems and aspirations of the community requires the cooperation between NHS organisations, public health department. Legislations contribute to this. The system of clinical governance brings together all the elements which seek to promote quality of care. ===Risk management=== Risk management involves consideration of the following components: Risks to patients: compliance with statutory regulations can help to minimise risks to patients. In addition, patient risks can be minimised by ensuring that systems are regularly reviewed and questioned ‚Äì for example, by critical event audit and learning from complaints. Medical ethical standards are also a key factor in maintaining patient and public safety and well-being. Risks to practitioners: ensuring that healthcare professionals are immunised against infectious diseases, working in a safe environment (e.g. safety in acute mental health units, promoting an anti-harassment culture) and are kept up-to-date on important parts of quality assurance. Furthermore, keeping healthcare professionals up to date with guidelines such as fire safety, basic life support (BLS) and local trust updates is also important, these can be annually or more frequent depending on risk stratification. Risks to the organisation: poor quality is a threat to any organisation. In addition to reducing risks to patients and practitioners, organisations need to reduce their own risks by ensuring high quality employment practice (including locum procedures and reviews of individual and team performance), a safe environment (including estates and privacy), and well designed policies on public involvement. Balancing these risk components may be an ideal that is difficult to achieve in practice. Recent research by Fischer and colleagues at the University of Oxford finds that tensions between 'first order' risks (based on clinical care) and 'second order' risks (based on organisational reputation) can produce unintended contradictions, conflict, and may even precipitate organisational crisis. ===Information management=== Information management in health: Patient records (demographic, Socioeconomic, Clinical information) proper collection, management and use of information within healthcare systems will determine the system‚Äôs effectiveness in detecting health problems, defining priorities, identifying innovative solutions and allocating resources to improve health outcomes. ==Application in the field== If clinical governance is to truly function effectively as a systematic approach to maintaining and improving the quality of patient care within a health system, it requires advocates. It also requires systems and people to be in place to promote and develop it. The system has found supporters outside of the UK. The not-for-profit UK hospital accreditation group the Trent Accreditation Scheme base their system upon NHS clinical governance, and apply it to hospitals in Hong Kong and Malta. Also in the Spanish National Health Service several experiences has been implemented, such the ones in Andaluc√≠a and Asturias. ==Notes== ==References== *G. Scally and L. J.

Portfolios may be held by individual investors or managed by financial professionals, hedge funds, banks and other financial institutions. It is a generally accepted principle that a portfolio is designed according to the investor's risk tolerance, time frame and investment objectives. The monetary value of each asset may influence the risk/reward ratio of the portfolio. When determining asset allocation, the aim is to maximise the expected return and minimise the risk. This is an example of a multi-objective optimization problem: many efficient solutions are available and the preferred solution must be selected by considering a tradeoff between risk and return. In particular, a portfolio A is dominated by another portfolio A' if A' has a greater expected gain and a lesser risk than A. If no portfolio dominates A, A is a Pareto-optimal portfolio. The set of Pareto-optimal returns and risks is called the Pareto efficient frontier for the Markowitz portfolio selection problem. Recently, an alternative approach to portfolio diversification has been suggested in the literatures that combines risk and return in the optimization problem. ==Description== There are many types of portfolios including the market portfolio and the zero-investment portfolio. A portfolio's asset allocation may be managed utilizing any of the following investment approaches and principles: dividend weighting, equal weighting, capitalization-weighting, price-weighting, risk parity, the capital asset pricing model, arbitrage pricing theory, the Jensen Index, the Treynor ratio, the Sharpe diagonal (or index) model, the value at risk model, modern portfolio theory and others. There are several methods for calculating portfolio returns and performance. One traditional method is using quarterly or monthly money-weighted returns; however, the true time-weighted method is a method preferred by many investors in financial markets. There are also several models for measuring the performance attribution of a portfolio's returns when compared to an index or benchmark, partly viewed as investment strategy. ==See also== * * Capital asset pricing model * Infection ratio * Investment management ==References== Category:Financial markets Category:Investment Category:Personal finance ","title":"Portfolio (finance)"},{"id":"1436845","text":"Terminal symbol A terminal strip, to which wires can be soldered A terminal is the point at which a conductor from a component, device or network comes to an end.

It consists of the counties Vestfold og Telemark, Viken, Oslo and Innlandet. Eastern Norway is by far the most populous region of Norway. It contains the country's capital, Oslo, which is Norway's most populous city. In Norwegian, the region is called √òstlandet and Austlandet (\\"The east land\\") in contrast to Vestlandet (\\"The west land\\"). ==Geography== As of 2015, the region had 2,593,085 inhabitants, 50.4% of Norway's population. The region is bounded by mountains in the north and west, the Swedish border to the east and by Viken and Skagerrak to the south. The border towards S√∏rlandet is less obvious. The mountains reach a height of 2469 metres in the Jotunheimen mountain range, the highest point in the Nordic countries (excluding Greenland). Other prominent mountain ranges include part of the Dovrefjell in the far north of the region, the Rondane north east of Lillehammer and others. The high plateau of Hardangervidda extends into Western Norway. Valleys cut deep into the mountains, from east to west the main valleys are √òsterdal, Gudbrandsdal, Valdres, Hallingdal, Numedal and the many valleys of Telemark. √òsterdalen is surrounded by mostly flat areas of conifer forests, but the others are all deeply cut into the mountains. Most of eastern Norway's southern half is dominated of rolling hills with pine and spruce forests, and agricultural land down in the valleys The area around the Oslo fjord and towards the north east are comparatively flat, and there are patches of intensely cultivated lands, notably Hedmarken, Toten, Hadeland, Ringerike and others. The population density in the flatlands is the highest in the nation, and some 40% of the nation's population lives within 200 km of Oslo. Numerous islands shelter the coasts, creating a paradise for swimmers and boaters in the summer. == Municipalities == ==People, culture and folklore== The Norwegian dialects spoken in the south-east share a common intonation, but there is some variation in grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation. The dialects of the interior mountainous areas (Hedmark, Oppland, and interior parts of Buskerud and Telemark) are all distinct. The dialects of the coastal areas (Telemark, Vestfold, Akershus, southern Buskerud, Oslo and √òstfold) are more similar to the written language (Bokm√•l); in fact, Urban East Norwegian can be said to be an unofficial standard pronunciation of Bokm√•l. The eastern forests of Finnskogen were the home of an ethnic minority, immigrants from Finland that came in the 17th century. Their language and culture was preserved into the 20th century, but now only folk tunes and food specialities remain. The southernmost group of Norway's Sami population is to be found in the north-eastern corner, in Engerdal. The culture of mountain valleys is preserved to a greater degree than the more urbanized metropolitan areas. The area is distinguished with traditional architecture, like stave churches and lafteverk, folk music and food. Some are concerned for the loss of local culture in the face of modernization. There are many tourist traps, which have a tendency of becoming Disneyland versions of the actual culture, especially in the ski resorts, which are transformed by people from the cities, with increased building of shops, hotels and vacation houses. It is common to see moose warning signs missing from their posts, because of many tourists taking them home as a souvenir. This is of course illegal, and can result in a fine. The coastal region is densely populated both by Norwegian and European standards. This region was the early industrialized. Traditionally the biggest export was timber and shipping, now employment in the industrial sector is in decline and most people are working in service-oriented companies. The coastal area is varied, from the metropolitan Oslo to the more quiet and idyllic old maritime city of Dr√∏bak, and the oldest city in Norway, T√∏nsberg There is also some museum railway lines, for example the Kr√∏der Line, where one can ride heritage steam and diesel trains on old twisty railway tracks. Oslo, the capital of Norway, has attracted people from all over Norway. Most of the immigrants settle here as well. There are numerous mosques, Hindu shrines, Sikh temples, Buddhist temples, as well as many churches, giving Oslo a cosmopolitan feel. ==References== Category:Regions of Norway ","title":"Eastern Norway"},{"id":"1436852","text":"William Dee Calhoun (August 3, 1934 - December 7, 1989) was an American professional wrestler, who used the professional name \\"Haystack\\" or \\"Haystacks\\" Calhoun. ==Early life== Born on August 3, 1934, William Dee Calhoun grew up on a farm in McKinney, Texas; a rural suburb located in Collin County about north of Dallas. By age 14, he already weighed . By the time he was in his early 20s, Calhoun weighed over . Calhoun first broke into wrestling in 1955 and he began competing for local promoter Orville Brown. ==Professional wrestling career== Initially performing under the name \\"Country Boy Calhoun\\", he performed in various regional territories, including Houston, Kansas City, and Canada. However, he first appeared nationally on Art Linkletter‚Äôs House Party, a televised variety show where Calhoun tossed full bales of hay into a high loft. As a result of this feat, he adopted the name \\"Haystacks Calhoun\\". Recognizing the show business potential of such a gimmick, Calhoun decided to exaggerate his hillbilly persona by adopting the fictional birthplace of Morgan's Corner, Arkansas, while sporting a bushy beard, white t-shirt, blue overalls, and a genuine horseshoe around his neck on a chain. Moreover, while promoters typically did not book him for championships, he seldom lost a match. He was often booked in handicap matches and battle royals. Calhoun with Mario Milano and Tex McKenzie in 1971 He was matched up against fellow wrestling giant Happy Humphrey in a series of highly promoted altercations at Madison Square Garden during the early 1960s. At over 750 lbs (340 kg), Humphrey outweighed Calhoun by over and was considerably slower than Calhoun. Calhoun took the majority of the decisions over Humphrey, many by count out as Humphrey often could not get himself back into the ring by the count of 20 when thrown out. On April 14, 1961, in the Chicago International Amphitheater, he challenged Capitol Wrestling NWA United States heavyweight champion \\"Nature Boy\\" Buddy Rogers in a second attempt to take the U.S. title. This bout ended in failure when Rogers dropkicked Calhoun to the ropes and the middle rope broke and Calhoun tumbled to the concrete floor and was counted out. Calhoun had also lost his first championship bout with Rogers in New York's Sunnyside Gardens on January 28, 1961. Although mainly active in the eastern half of the United States, he also wrestled in Australia, on tour with other American wrestlers in bouts promoted by U.S. promoter Sam Menacker. He also wrestled for NWA: All-Star Wrestling in Vancouver, where he twice won the NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship with Don Leo Jonathan. He formed a tag team with the over Mountain Man Mike on the West Coast. After engaging in a feud against Dick the Bruiser, Calhoun then generally traveled from territory to territory, never staying in one region for too long. In 1966 he won both the NWA Tri-State Tag Team Championship and the NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship while teaming with Jack Brisco and Don Leo Jonathan, respectively. Moreover, he then helped attract fans to the fledgling Northeast promotion World Wide Wrestling Federation. On May 30, 1973, Calhoun paired with Tony Garea to defeat the Japanese duo of Mr. Fuji and Prof. Toru Tanaka for the WWF Tag Team Title. However, his weight and declining health eventually forced him into retirement, and he was ultimately confined to a double-wide trailer after losing his left leg to diabetes in 1986. He died at age 55 on December 7, 1989. He is buried in Scott Cemetery in Collin County, Texas. His daughter donated mementos of his wrestling career to the Collin County museum. ==Legacy== Calhoun was more directly an influence on British super heavyweight wrestler Martin Ruane, best known in America for his stint as Loch Ness in World Championship Wrestling. Ruane achieved fame in his home country as \\"Giant Haystacks\\", a modified version of Calhoun's gimmick. Ruane first wrestled as \\"Haystacks Calhoun\\", a direct copy of the American original, while working for Wrestling Enterprises (of Birkenhead) in the early 1970s, before modifying his name and character. Thus adapted, Ruane later moved to Joint Promotions where he achieved television exposure and national fame as the tag team partner - and later arch enemy - of Big Daddy.The Wrestling Simon Garfield, Faber & Faber 1996 Calhoun often appeared at Capital Arena in Washington, D.C. scuffling on televised bouts. A. J. Weberman was head of Haystacks Calhoun fan club. On March 31, 2017, Calhoun was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a part of the Legacy Wing. ==Other media== Calhoun appears briefly at the end of the 1962 theatrical motion picture version of Rod Serling's teleplay Requiem For A Heavyweight. The protagonist, played by Anthony Quinn, is a punch-drunk prize fighter slipping into oblivion but his manager, played by Jackie Gleason, finds a way to squeeze a few more bucks from his career by lining him up for a \\"professional wrestling\\" match. The opponent's name is stated on a poster for the event, and announced as Quinn's character approaches the ring, but only the upper fourth of the wrestler's torso is seen, from the rear, on screen. He scratches his head in response to the behavior of this unknown newcomer. The film's credits make no reference, however, to Calhoun's participation. ==Championships and accomplishments== * Big Time Wrestling (Massachusetts) ** BTW Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with Sweet Daddy SikiBig Time Wrestling Tag Team Title (Massachusetts) at Wrestling-Titles.com.

His band of No Goods consist of several lookalike henchmen clad in hats and coats, who simultaneously utter incomprehensible phrases of agreement to whatever he says. * The Solenoid Robots, green metal gas mask-faced evildoers from outer space who have a unicycle-like wheel instead of legs and talk in barely understandable electronic voices. * Red Dog the Pirate, a redheaded short, squat scourge of the seven seas with an eye patch, peg-leg and a wiseacre parrot named Carl Bob for a sidekick. * Blond, long-nosed, Zsa Zsa Gabor-accented foreign spy femme fatale Jacqueline Hyde (a play on Jekyll and Hyde). * Dr. Frank N. Schwine, a Boris Karloff soundalike mad scientist who, with the help of his purple propeller beanie-wearing assistant Sidney, keeps creating huge hulking Frankenstein-style monsters only to have them defeated by Roger and become football players. * Count Batguy, a bald Nosferatu-style vampire from Transylvania complete with Bela Lugosi accent. * Dr. What, internationally feared evil genius. * Sexy senorita Tequila Mockingbird (a play on To Kill a Mockingbird) who teams up with her bandito boyfriends the Enchilada Brothers, Beef and Chicken, to stir up revolution in the tiny Latin American country of San Domino. Another recurring, non-criminal character in the series was sportscaster Vincent Yafnarro, who appeared in several sports-related episodes. Roger's tough little old mother, Ma Ramjet, appeared in several episodes; her voice was an imitation of Jonathan Winters' \\"Maude Frickert\\" character, and she had her own variation on her son's Proton Energy Pills, \\"Ma Ramjet's Atomic Vitamins for Old People whose Get-Up-and-Go Got Up and Left.\\" Lance Crossfire (a parody of actor Burt Lancaster), Ramjet's toothy test pilot rival for the affections of his short, Southern-accented sweetheart Lotta Love, is also likely to get in the way. When Lance and Roger cross paths, neither one of them wins: in one episode, the always fickle Lotta ends up going out with General Brassbottom, who promises the two men that he will take care of her. As is his way, Roger does not realize that they have both lost ‚Äî unlike Lance, who inevitably ends these cartoons with the phrase, \\"Oh, Roger ‚Äî Shut up!\\" ==Episodes== ===Season one (1965)=== # \\"Dr. Ivan Evilkisser\\" # \\"The Sheik\\" # \\"Bat Guy\\" # \\"The Shaft\\" # \\"Kokomo\\" # \\"Baseball\\" # \\"The Cowboy\\" # \\"Dee Kidnap\\" # \\"Drafted\\" # \\"TV Crisis\\" # \\"Miss America\\" # \\"The Pirates\\" # \\"Revolution\\" # \\"Torture\\" # \\"The Race\\" # \\"Jack the Nipper\\" # \\"Ma Ramjet\\" # \\"The Cockroaches\\" - this episode is a parody of The Beatles # \\"Moon\\" # \\"Hi Noon\\" # \\"Bank Robbers\\" # \\"Sun Clouds\\" # \\"Football\\" # \\"Bullfighter\\" # \\"Bathysphere\\" # \\"Skydiving\\" # \\"Monkey\\" # \\"Dr. Frank N.

The show was also on the BBC and ITV from 1979 to 1994 in the UK and Europe wide on Sky Channel from 1985 to 1989 and Bravo from 1992 to 1993. In Australia, in 1966 the show appeared on the ABC in the afternoon, and has been shown regularly on Australian television ever since. Selected Minisodes of the show are available to view for free on Crackle. The series was also screened in several other countries including ZNBC in Zambia, Dubai 33 in the U.A.E., SABC1 in South Africa, KBC in Kenya and TV2 in New Zealand. As of 2017, the show aired on Kids & Teens TV in the US. ==Production notes== *The creators of the series were from Lompoc, California and worked in many references to the town into the series,Pierce, Leonard. http://www.tv.com/news/roger-ramjet-a-cartoon-for-the-ages--22053/ including setting several episodes there. Invariably, the name of the town was mispronounced. *The name \\"Roger\\" came about after producer Fred Crippen had an interview with a reporter named Roger Smith. Smith asked Crippen about his new TV series and then joked that the main character should be named Roger. *The theme song's lyrics are sung to the melody of Yankee Doodle. ==Other credits== * Associate Producers: Dick Reed, Paul Shively * Production Coordinator: Fred Calvert * Animation: Don Schloat, Alan Zaslove, Bill Hutton, George Nicholas, Fred Crippen * Background: Jack Heiter * Layout: Rosemary O'Connor, Sam Weiss, Joe Bruno, Dave Hanan, Bob Kurtz * Sound Effects: Phil Kaye * Ink and Paint: Constance Crawley * Checking: Dottie Mullens * Sound: TV Recorders, Western Recorders ==DVD release== On February 8, 2005, Classic Media (distributed by Sony Wonder) released Roger Ramjet: Hero Of Our Nation (Special Collector's Edition), a 3-Disc box set containing 119 of the 156 episodes of the series (although the box incorrectly states that 120 episodes are included).

It owes its name, meaning \\"seven rivers\\" (literally \\"seven waters\\") in Kazakh and Persian, to the rivers which flow from the south-east into Lake Balkhash. When the region was incorporated into the Russian Empire in the 19th century, it became known in Russian (and, to an extent, in European languages) as Semirechye (), which is a Russian calque of the Kazakh \\"Zhetysu\\". The name has also been transcribed as Semiryechye, Semirech'e, Semirechiye, Semirechie, Semirechensk or Semireche. Zhetysu falls into today's Almaty Region, which is part of Kazakhstan. However, the Semirechye Oblast, as an administrative unit of the Russian Empire, included not only Zhetysu proper but also lands that now constitute parts of northern Kyrgyzstan and adjacent provinces of Kazakhstan as well. ==Geography== DMA, 1985) In the hills between Bishkek and Almaty The lands of the 19th-century Semirechye Oblast included the steppes south of Lake Balkhash and parts of the Tian Shan Mountains around Lake Issyk Kul. The province had an area of 147,300 km¬≤, and was bounded by the province of Semipalatinsk on the north, by China (Xinjiang) on the east and south, and by the former Russian provinces of Fergana, Syr-darya, and Akmolinsk on the west. The Dzungarian Alatau Mountains, which separated it from the Chinese region of Kulja, extend south-west towards the river Ili, with an average height of 2,700 m (9,000 ft) above the sea, several isolated snow-clad peaks reaching 3,400 to 4,300 m (11,000 to 14,000 ft). In the south, the region embraces the intricate systems of the Ala-Tau and the Tian Shan. Two ranges of the former, the Trans-Ili Ala-tau and the Terskey Ala-tau, stretch along the north shore of Lake Issyk Kul, both ranging from 3,000 to 4,600 m (10,000 to 15,000 ft) and both partially snow-clad. South of the lake, two ranges of the Tian Shan, separated by the valley of the Naryn, stretch in the same direction, lifting up their icy peaks to 1,800 and 2,400 m (6,000 and 8,000 ft); while westwards from the lake the precipitous slopes of the Alexander chain, 2,700 to 3,000 m (9,000 to 10,000 ft) high, with peaks rising 900 to 1,200 m (3,000 to 4,000 ft) higher, extend into the former province of Syr-darya (containing the southern Kazakh cities of Chimkent, Auliye-ata and Turkestan). Another mountain complex of much lower elevation runs north-westwards from the Trans- Ili Ala-tau towards the southern extremity of Lake Balkhash. In the north, where the province bordered Semipalatinsk, it included the western parts of the Tarbagatai range, the summits of which (3,000 m or 10,000 ft) do not reach the limit of perpetual snow. The remainder of the province consisted of a fertile steppe in the north-east (Sergiopol), and vast uninhabitable sand- steppes on the south of Lake Balkhash. Southwards from these at the foot of the mountains and at the entrance to the valleys, there are rich areas of fertile land. ===Climate=== Lake Kaindy The climate in Zhetysu is thoroughly continental. In the Balkhash steppes the winter is very cold. The lake freezes every year, with temperatures falling to ‚àí11¬∞C (13¬∞F). In the Ala-kul steppes the winds blow away the snow. The passage from winter to spring is very abrupt, and the steppes are rapidly clothed with vegetation, which, however, is soon scorched by the sun. Average temperatures at Almaty (733 m, 2,405 ft high) are: for the year , for January ‚àí8¬∞C (17¬∞F), for July 23¬∞C (74¬∞F). At Przhevalsk (1,660 m, 5,450 ft): for the year 2.5¬∞C (36.5¬∞F), for January ‚àí5¬∞C (23¬∞F), for July 17¬∞C (63¬∞F); still higher in the mountains, at Naryn (2,100 m, 6,900 ft), the average temperature for the year is only 6.5¬∞C (43.7¬∞F), for January ‚àí17¬∞C (1.4¬∞F), for July 18¬∞C (64.4¬∞F). ===Bodies of water=== The most important river is the Ili, which enters Zhetysu from the Tian Shan mountains of China's Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in northern Xinjiang, and drains it for 250 km before it enters Lake Balkhash. The Chu River also rises in the Tian Shan mountains and flows north-westwards through the former Akmolinsk province of the Governor-Generalship of the Steppes. The Naryn River flows south-westwards along a longitudinal valley of the Tian Shan, and enters the Fergana Valley to join the Syr Darya. The major lakes of the area include Lake Balkhas (or Denghiz) and Lake Ala Kul, which was connected with Balkash in the post-Pliocene period but now stands some hundred feet higher, connected by a chain of smaller lakes with Sissyk Kul, Lake Issyk-Kul, and the alpine lakes of Son-Kul and Chatyr-Kul. ==Population== The population was estimated in 1906 as 1,080,700. Kazakhs formed 76% of the population, Russians 14%, Taranchi 5.7%. ==History and administration== History of the central steppe has an outline history with links to the many peoples who lived in this area. In the VI-III vv. BC. e. the Iranian Sakas (Scythians) established their first state, whose center was in Zhetysu. In the mid 6th century, the Turkic nomads subordinated Zhetysu (Semirechie), Central Kazakhstan, and Khorezm. The Semirechye Oblast as it existed in 1900 A 1903 map in Polish showing both the large Semirechye Oblast (Semirjecze≈Ñsk in Polish) and its neighbors. The map also shows a much smaller historical area labeled Siedmiorzecze (Polish translation for Russian \\"Semirechye\\", i.e. Zhetysu proper) southeast of Lake Balkhash Ascension Cathedral, Almaty (modern view) The area belonged to Dzungar Khanate in the 17th century. When Dzungar Khanate was eliminated by Qing China in 1755 the area formed part of empire and was under the direct rule by General of Ili (), headquartered at the fort of Huiyuan (the so-called \\"Manchu Kuldja\\", or Yili), 30 km west of Ghulja (Yining). Most of Zhetysu was annexed by the Russian Empire from Qing China in 1854, before the outbreak of the Crimean War, which delayed the southern advance. The territorial change was confirmed by the Treaty of Tarbagatai, where Russia gained about 350,000 square miles of territory at the expense of Chinese Xinjiang. The two major Russian fortresses and garrisons in the region, Verny and Pishpek, were founded in 1854 on the sites of former Kokandian fortresses on the Steppe frontier. The Semirechye Cossack Host was created in 1867 as a branch of the Siberian Cossack Host. From 1867-1884 this province was made part of Russian Turkestan, and from then until 1899 it was incorporated in the Governor- Generalship of the Steppes before reverting to Russian Turkestan that year. The province was divided into six districts, the chief towns of which were Verny (the capital), Jarkent, Kopal, Pishpek, Przhevalsk and Sergiopol. Before the Russian revolution the chief occupation of the Russians, the Taranchis and the Dzungars, and partly also of the Kazakhs of the region, was agriculture. The most important crops were wheat, barley, oats, millet, rice and potatoes. A variety of oil-bearing plants and green fodder, as also cotton, hemp, flax and poppies, were grown. Livestock breeding was very extensively carried on by the Kazakhs, namely, horses, cattle, sheep, camels, goats and pigs. Orchards and fruit gardens were well developed; and the Russian Imperial crown maintained two model gardens. Bee-keeping was widely spread. The factories consisted of flour-mills, distilleries, tanneries and tobacco works; but a great many domestic trades, including carpet-weaving and the making of felt goods, saddlery and iron goods, were carried on, among both the settled inhabitants and the nomadic Kazakhs. There was also trade with China, valued at less than half a million sterling annually in 1911. From 1905, after the Russian-Japanese war and the construction of the Trans-Aral Railway, the settlement of Russian people in the area increased greatly under the guidance of the new Migration Department in St. Petersburg (–ü–µ—Ä–µ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ –£–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ). The province was administered by Vasile Balabanov under General Alexander Dutov until the Bolshevik take-over in 1921, when both Dutov and Balabanov escaped to China. A shop in 19th century Almaty After the Central Asian Revolt of 1916 and the Russian Revolution of 1917 the Provisional Government's authority in the region collapsed. Approximately 2,500 Russian settlers are thought to have been killed by the Kazakhs in the violence that followed in Zhetysu, and this was followed by equally bloody reprisals against the nomadic population, led by the (all-Russian) workers' & soldiers' Soviets in Tashkent and Verny. Bolshevik control was reimposed in 1918-21 in a series of campaigns led by Mikhail Frunze, after whom the town of Pishpek in Zhetysu was renamed. In 1924, Zhetysu was incorporated in the southern portion of the new Kazakh ASSR by the new Soviet Union, and, in 1931, this was made a full Soviet Republic and nominally independent of Russia. In 1936 the Kyrgyz ASSR, which incorporated the southern portion of Zhetysu, also became a Soviet Republic. In late 1991, both republics declared their independence from the Soviet Union, forming the new nations of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan respectively. ==Derived names== The Semirechensk pig and the Semirechensk Salamander are named after the region. The name of Onsu County (Wensu) in nearby Aksu Prefecture, Xinjiang, China similarly means \\"ten water\\" in Uyghur and other Turkic languages- both names consist of a number followed by 'su' (river; water). The name 'Aksu' in nearby Aksu Prefecture is Turkic for 'white water'. Kizilsu, name of a river and of a nearby prefecture in Xinjiang, means ‚Äúred water‚Äù (). ==References== * * Miracles of the Zhetysu (Russian) Category:History of Kazakhstan Category:History of Kyrgyzstan ","title":"Zhetysu"},{"id":"1436888","text":"In software, a stack overflow occurs if the call stack pointer exceeds the stack bound. The call stack may consist of a limited amount of address space, often determined at the start of the program. The size of the call stack depends on many factors, including the programming language, machine architecture, multi-threading, and amount of available memory. When a program attempts to use more space than is available on the call stack (that is, when it attempts to access memory beyond the call stack's bounds, which is essentially a buffer overflow), the stack is said to overflow, typically resulting in a program crash. ==Causes== ===Infinite recursion=== The most- common cause of stack overflow is excessively deep or infinite recursion, in which a function calls itself so many times that the space needed to store the variables and information associated with each call is more than can fit on the stack.What is the difference between a segmentation fault and a stack overflow? at StackOverflow An example of infinite recursion in C. int foo() { return foo(); } The function foo, when it is invoked, continues to invoke itself, allocating additional space on the stack each time, until the stack overflows resulting in a segmentation fault. However, some compilers implement tail-call optimization, allowing infinite recursion of a specific sort‚Äîtail recursion‚Äîto occur without stack overflow. This works because tail-recursion calls do not take up additional stack space. Some C compiler options will effectively enable tail-call optimization; for example, compiling the above simple program using gcc with \`-O1\` will result in a segmentation fault, but not when using \`-O2\` or \`-O3\`, since these optimization levels imply the \`-foptimize-sibling-calls\` compiler option. Other languages, such as Scheme, require all implementations to include tail-recursion as part of the language standard. ===Very deep recursion=== A recursive function that terminates in theory but causes a call stack buffer overflow in practice can be fixed by transforming the recursion into a loop and storing the function arguments in an explicit stack (rather than the implicit use of the call stack). This is always possible, because the class of primitive recursive functions is equivalent to the class of LOOP computable functions. Consider this example in C++-like pseudocode: { width=\\"100%\\" !width=\\"50%\\" !width=\\"50%\\" -  void function (argument) { if (condition) function (argument.next); }  stack.push(argument); while (!stack.empty()) { argument = stack.pop(); if (condition) stack.push(argument.next); } } A primitive recursive function like the one on the left side can always be transformed into a loop like on the right side. A function like the example above on the left would not be a problem in an environment supporting tail-call optimization; however it is still possible to create a recursive function that may result in a stack overflow in these languages. Consider the example below of two simple integer exponentiation functions. { width=\\"100%\\" !width=\\"50%\\" !width=\\"50%\\" -  int pow(int base, int exp) { if (exp > 0) return base * pow(base, exp - 1); else return 1; }  int pow(int base, int exp) { return pow_accum(base, exp, 1); } int pow_accum(int base, int exp, int accum) { if (exp > 0) return pow_accum(base, exp - 1, accum * base); else return accum; } } Both \`pow(base, exp)\` functions above compute an equivalent result, however, the one on the left is prone to causing a stack overflow because tail-call optimization is not possible for this function. During execution, the stack for these functions will look like this: { width=\\"100%\\" !width=\\"50%\\" !width=\\"50%\\" -  pow(5, 4) 5 * pow(5, 3) 5 * (5 * pow(5, 2)) 5 * (5 * (5 * pow(5, 1))) 5 * (5 * (5 * (5 * pow(5, 0)))) 5 * (5 * (5 * (5 * 1))) 625  pow(5, 4) pow_accum(5, 4, 1) pow_accum(5, 3, 5) pow_accum(5, 2, 25) pow_accum(5, 1, 125) pow_accum(5, 0, 625) 625 } Notice that the function on the left must store in its stack \`exp\` number of integers, which will be multiplied when the recursion terminates and the function returns 1. In contrast, the function at the right must only store 3 integers at any time, and computes an intermediary result which is passed to its following invocation. As no other information outside of the current function invocation must be stored, a tail-recursion optimizer can \\"drop\\" the prior stack frames, eliminating the possibility of a stack overflow. ===Very large stack variables=== The other major cause of a stack overflow results from an attempt to allocate more memory on the stack than will fit, for example by creating local array variables that are too large. For this reason some authors recommend that arrays larger than a few kilobytes should be allocated dynamically instead of as a local variable. An example of a very large stack variable in C: int foo() { double x[1048576]; } On a C implementation with 8 byte double-precision floats, the declared array consumes 8 megabytes of data; if this is more memory than is available on the stack (as set by thread creation parameters or operating system limits), a stack overflow will occur. Stack overflows are made worse by anything that reduces the effective stack size of a given program. For example, the same program being run without multiple threads might work fine, but as soon as multi-threading is enabled the program will crash. This is because most programs with threads have less stack space per thread than a program with no threading support. Because kernels are generally multi-threaded, people new to kernel development are usually discouraged from using recursive algorithms or large stack buffers. ==See also== *Buffer overflow *Call stack *Heap overflow *Stack buffer overflow *Double fault ==References== ==External links== * The reasons why 64-bit programs require more stack memory Category:Software bugs Category:Computer errors ","title":"Stack overflow"},{"id":"1436901","text":"Mynydd Bodafon (Bodafon Mountain) is a small collection of peaks including the Arwydd (The Sign or signal) which is the highest point on the island of Anglesey (although not in the county of Anglesey ‚Äî see Holyhead Mountain). It lies about 2¬Ω miles west of the coastal town of Moelfre and ‚Öî of a mile south- west of the hamlet of Brynrefail. The meaning of Bodafon is obscure. Bod is a common placename element meaning 'dwelling' and afon here is probably a corruption of the personal name A(e)ddan (afon is Welsh for 'river' but topography rules that out).Melville Richards, Atlas M√¥n (Llangefni, 1972). On the mountain is a lake named Gors Fawr (the big marsh), containing rudd, roach and recently pike. Originally, there were two lakes on either side of the road but one is now a covered reservoir. The lake is spring fed despite local legends that claim it is connected to lakes in Snowdonia, and is bottomless. To the east of the lake is found an Iron Age settlement called Cytiau'r Gwyddelod (Irishmen's huts). The wildlife is dictated by the heathland habitat, different heathers, two types of gorse, cotton grass, bog asphodel, tormentil etc. There are adders, lizards, stone chats, peregrine, chough and cuckoos (there is an old local song about the cuckoo on Bodafon) etc. Heron, coot and ducks are in the lake and water rail are occasionally seen or heard. A rare form of pillwort exists in the lake. Mynydd Bodafon holds a special place in druidic and spiritual history Although the name Mynydd Bodafon may refer to the hill itself, it is also the name for the wider geographical area, which is part of the Penrhoslligwy parish. Rabbits tend to be the only grazing animals currently and parts of the heath are reverting to pioneer woodland because of that. There are occasional fires that sweep across the heathland but these are often at the wrong time of year and subsequently encourage bracken. ==References== ==External links== * www.geograph.co.uk : photos of Mynydd Bodafon and surrounding area Category:Marilyns of Wales Category:Mountains and hills of Anglesey Category:Moelfre, Anglesey Category:Llanddyfnan ","title":"Mynydd Bodafon"},{"id":"1436909","text":"Code page 855 (CCSID 855) (also known as CP 855, IBM 00855, OEM 855, MS-DOS Cyrillic) is a code page used under DOS to write Cyrillic script.

It lies about two miles west of the town of Holyhead, and slopes steeply down to the Irish Sea on two sides. Ireland can be seen from here on a clear day and the mountain is an important site for seabirds. ==The mountain== Holyhead Mountain is located on Holy Island, Anglesey, jutting out into the Irish Sea. At , it is the highest mountain in the county of Anglesey, being higher than Bodafon Mountain () on the main island. On the east side of the mountain is the site of a late Roman watchtower called Caer y T≈µr (Tower Fortress), from which Holyhead Mountain's Welsh name is derived. Holyhead Mountain also has an Iron Age stone circle settlement near its foot. This shows evidence of being occupied in the middle part of the Stone Age, the Neolithic Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. There are traces of field systems and the bases of dry-stone walls of twenty huts, and there are a number of standing stones in the vicinity. The summit of the mountain is rocky and the slopes clad in heather. The material for the breakwater at the port of Holyhead was quarried from the mountain, with seven million tons of limestone being removed from its quarries to form the longest breakwater in Britain, at nearly long. On the mountain are also the remains of a brickworks, which closed in 1973. Specialist bricks produced here were also used in construction of the breakwater. Holyhead Mountain attracts many visitors, and it is also located close to South Stack lighthouse; many people come to see the variety of birds that nest along the cliff faces near South Stack. Views from the summit are extensive, especially to the west, where the Wicklow Mountains in Ireland can often be seen across the Irish Sea on clear days. Birds that nest here include Atlantic puffins, stonechats and oyster catchers, and grey seals can be seen offshore during the summer. ==Gallery== Trig point at the top of the mountain.

Many districts have deep historical roots, and only partially coincide with today's administrative units of counties and municipalities. The districts are defined by geographical features, often valleys, mountain ranges, fjords, plains, or coastlines, or combinations of the above. Many such regions were petty kingdoms up to the early Viking Age. ==Regional identity== Southern Norway's districts during the Middle Ages Northern Norway's districts during the Middle Ages A high percentage of Norwegians identify themselves more by the district they live in or come from, than the formal administrative unit(s) whose jurisdiction they fall under. A significant reason for this is that the districts, through their strong geographical limits, have historically delineated the region(s) within which one could travel without too much trouble or expenditure of time and money (on foot or skis, by horse/ox-drawn cart or sleigh or dog sled, or by one's own small rowing or sail boat). Thus, dialects and regional commonality in folk culture tended to correspond to those same geographical units, despite any division into administrative districts by authorities. In modern times the whole country has become more closely connected, based on the following: *Communication technologies such as telegraph, newspapers, telephone, radio and TV, in particular Televerket and NRK. *The construction of mountain crossings, tunnels through mountains, bridges, undersea tunnels; many of these projects, particularly the larger bridges and the undersea tunnels, were undertaken as late as the 1970s forward. *Establishing a coastal express route of combined passenger and cargo ships, like the Hurtigruten, sailing regularly from Bergen to Kirkenes and back again, and stopping by at a host of cities and towns along the western and northern coast. *The construction of railroads between distant parts of the country. *The opening of dozens of new airports all over the country through the 1960s and 1970s. *The release of private cars from government rationing and import restrictions from the 1950s onwards. A concrete display of the Norwegian habit of identifying themselves by district can be seen in the many regional costumes, called bunad, strictly connected to distinct districts across the country. Commonly, even city dwellers proudly mark their rural origins by wearing such a costume, from their ancestral landscape, at weddings, visits with members of the royal family, Constitution Day (May 17), and other ceremonial occasions. ==List of traditional districts== The following list is non-exhaustive and partially overlapping.

Ultimo is located 2 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Sydney. Broadway is a locality around the road of the same name, which is located on the borders of Ultimo, Chippendale and Glebe. ==History== \\"Ultimo\\" was originally the name of the estate of Dr John Harris, on granted to him by Governor King in 1803, for his military service and for aiding the governor in curtailing the illegal trading of rum by a corrupt group in the NSW Corps (the Rum Corps). It was named for a clerical error in a legal case against Harris that had prevented him being court-martialled. The court-martial based on fictitious charges was used as a retaliation by the Rum Corps. His offence was listed as \\"ultimo\\" (having occurred in the previous month) when it should have been cited as \\"instant\\" (having occurred in the same month).From heaven to hell in one easy walk - National - www.smh.com.au Harris Street is named in his honour.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 257 The area remained as farmland, in possession of the Harris family, until it was subdivided in 1859. At that time, most of the current streets were laid out, and the descendants of John Harris constructed the first residences in the area (at least one of which-a row of terraces in Wattle Street-was still owned by the family in the early 1980s). Farmers and Graziers warehouse in Wattle Street, a typical example of the Federation Warehouse style Residential development accelerated in the 1880s. In 1891 the population of the Pyrmont-Ultimo area was 19,177, in 3,966 dwellings. The population peaked at around 30,000 in 1900. However, the construction of factories, quarries, woolstores and a power station in the early 20th century saw the demolition of hundreds of houses, and a steady decline in population. It was a good site for warehouses because of its proximity to Darling Harbour. Several examples of the Federation Warehouse style can be found along Wattle Street. By 1954, the population of Pyrmont and Ultimo was 5,000, and by 1978 it was just 1,800.Matthews, Michael R. Pyrmont & Ultimo a History (1982) For approximately ten years from the early 1950s, Harris Street was home to the head office, recording studio, pressing plant and warehouse of Festival Records, which was Australia's leading independent record company for almost 50 years. Festival moved its facilities to a site in nearby Pyrmont in 1966. In 1973, the Builders Labourers Federation organised a green ban with Pyrmont to stop the construction of the North-Western Expressway, which would've destroyed large parts of both suburbs. thumb Subsequently, many industries began to move to cheaper land further from the CBD, and the decline of the wool industry made Ultimo's 15 woolstores redundant. By the start of the 1980s, derelict industrial sites began to be redeveloped for residences, mostly as apartments, a process that continues to the present. Very little industry remains in the area, and its current character is a combination of residential and commercial. One conspicuous industrial relic is the brick shell of Davey's Flour Mill, built in 1911, and adjacent to the southern approach to the Anzac Bridge. Inglis' Bazaar & Saleyards, George St, Quay St, 1923, F. Cunninghame & Co.The Dairy Farmer's Cooperative operated from its facility in Harris Street and Ultimo Road from 1912 to its closure in 2009, after which the site was redeveloped by the nearby UTS in a project designed by architect Frank Gehry. Wentworth Park commenced its life as a creek and swamp, known from the 1830s as Blackwattle Cove Swamp. Wentworth Park became a rugby league oval and the home ground of the Glebe Dirty Reds who were a part of the New South Wales Rugby League premiership back in its inception. == Heritage listings == Ultimo has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Darling Harbour goods railway: Ultimo Road railway underbridge * 494 Harris Street: Ultimo Post Office * 41 Mountain Street: Ultimo Substation * William Henry Street: Ultimo Sewage Pumping Station ==Churches== One of the landmarks in the area is the Uniting Church on the corner of Quarry Street and Bulwara Road. The church was originally built in 1883 to replace the old Presbyterian Church at Mount Street, Pyrmont. The latter had been the first Presbyterian Church in the colony, but it outgrew its old premises and the congregation had to move to the new church in Ultimo. A manse was built a few years later. By 2001 the church was in bad repair and had to be restored with help from a government grant. The church is still active and the congregation goes by the name of The Mustard Seed.http://www.mustardseed.unitingchurch.org.au ==Commercial area of architecture== Marcus Clark building), an example of the Federation Free Classical style of architecture Farmers & Graziers, characteristic of the many warehouses found in Ultimo. The commercial areas of Ultimo are mainly centred on Broadway, Harris Street and Wattle Street. The Broadway Shopping Centre is located in the former site of the flagship building of the Grace Bros department store chain. The Ultimo area is undergoing gentrification, with considerable redevelopment of industrial buildings for residential and commercial purposes. The NSW transmission network service provider TransGrid is located on Thomas Street. The corporate headquarters and Sydney studios of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation are located in its Ultimo Centre on Harris Street. The Ultimo Centre also houses an auditorium and recording studio, known as the Eugene Goosens Hall. Sydney's community television station TVS, NITV & Aurora from a digital broadcast centre are located at Ultimo Centre. Harris Street is also the home of Sydney's Powerhouse Museum. Wentworth Park is a multi-purpose sporting facility in Ultimo that is used for various sports including rugby union, rugby league, soccer and greyhound racing. ==Transport== Evening buses running along George Street. Ultimo is well-served by public transport. Central railway station is at the southern border of the suburb, on the opposite side of Broadway. The Dulwich Hill Line of Sydney's light rail network has stations at the eastern edge of the suburb, where Ultimo borders Darling Harbour. Many buses travel along Broadway. A distinctive landmark in Ultimo is the former railway viaduct that now carries the light rail through Wentworth Park. The viaduct was built in 1922 and consists primarily of twenty-three brick arches. It is considered \\"an outstanding example of engineering brickwork\\" and is listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/40 The Goods Line is a park and pedestrian pathway utilising a section of the railway line not used by the light rail. ==Population== At the , it had a population of 8,845 of which 82.4% were born overseas. The 2001 census recorded a population of 4,054, 46% of whom were born overseas. Its proximity to Chinatown means that it has historically had a large Chinese population. In 2016, the most common ancestries in Ultimo were Chinese 36.6%, English 8.4%, Australian 5.8%, Thai 4.3% and Korean 3.3%. In Ultimo, 17.6% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were China 29.8%, Thailand 5.0%, South Korea 3.5%, Indonesia 3.1% and India 2.4%. 23.7% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 28.1%, Cantonese 7.0%, Thai 5.0%, Korean 3.2% and Indonesian 2.5%. The most common response for religion was No Religion at 49.9%. In 2016, 90.6% of residences were flats and 8.2% were semi-detached, row or terrace house, townhouse etc. ==Houses== Terraced houses in Wattle Street In common with other inner suburbs such as Surry Hills, Ultimo still has some of the oldest examples of Victorian terraces. Despite slum clearance and redevelopment during the 20th century, many fine examples exist which, as in other inner Sydney suburbs, have been progressively 'gentrified' in recent times. ==Education== Ultimo is home to the main campus of the University of Technology Sydney and the Sydney Institute of TAFE, the largest TAFE in New South Wales. International Grammar School is located near the western boundary.

It is located in the region of the island usually referred to as Mid-Island, immediately to the south of Port Richmond, to the west of Meiers Corners and Westerleigh, to the north of New Springville, and to the east of Bulls Head. ==History== Named for a brook that flowed through the area's farmland, Willowbrook once lay at the heart of the island's agricultural zone, and first saw other significant development when a military hospital opened there during World War II. After the war ended the property became the site of Willowbrook State School, a state-run institution for intellectually disabled children that became the scene of a national scandal in the 1970s when it was revealed that the children housed there were the victims of widespread abuse and neglect. The facility was forced to close by 1987, and six years later a campus of the College of Staten Island opened at the site. Willowbrook Park, a large city park, borders the college on the west. It was also home to the Seaview Hospital tuberculosis sanatorium, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. The neighborhood was also drastically transformed with the opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in November 1964. Soon after this, the farms were sold and broken up, and residential housing was built on the property. Many of the owners of the newly built homes were Jewish families, and as a result, Willowbrook became the center of the island's Orthodox Jewish community, which from the turn of the 20th century until the late 1960s and early 1970s was primarily centered in Staten Island's North Shore neighborhood of Tompkinsville along with most of Staten Island's then-small Jewish population. The 2010s saw a great influx to the Jewish community in Willowbrook, because of the housing crisis in Brooklyn. ==Demographics== Young Israel of Staten Island -- an Orthodox synagogue that is the island's largest Jewish house of worship -- is located in Willowbrook, as are a number of smaller Orthodox congregations, including Hasidic and Sephardic congregations. Although Willowbrook is home to non- Orthodox Jews as well, there are no non-Orthodox synagogues in the community. There are also many Italian-Americans as well as East Asian, African American, and South Asians. ==Education== ===School=== Willowbrook is the location of P.S. 54, an elementary school administered by the New York City Department of Education. ===Library=== The New York Public Library (NYPL)'s Todt Hill- Westerleigh branch is located at 2550 Victory Boulevard on the border between Willowbrook and Westerleigh.

It is mostly the same as code page 866, except for codes F2hex through F7hex (which code page 866 changes to Ukrainian and Belarusian letters) and codes F8hex through FBhex (where code page 866 matches code page 437 instead).

Unlike KBL, the Russian –Å/—ë is retained. It accompanies LST 1283 (Code page 774/1118), which encodes the additional Lithuanian letters at the same locations as LST 1284, but is based on Code page 437 instead.

IBM code page/CCSID 848 is a variant of code page/CCSID 1125 with the euro sign at FDhex, replacing ¬§. IBM code page/CCSID 849 is a variant of code page/CCSID 1131 with the euro sign at FBhex, replacing ¬§. === GOST R 34.303-92 === The GOST R 34.303-92 standard defines two variants. The more extensive variant, KOI-8 N2 (but not to be confused with the KOI-8 encoding, which it does not follow), matches code page 866 and the Alternative code page until the last row (codes 240 through 255, or F0hex through FFhex). For the last row, it supports letters for Belarusian and Ukrainian in addition to Russian, but in a layout unrelated to code page 866 or 1125. Notably, even the Russian –Å/—ë (which was unchanged between the Alternative code page and code page 866) is in a different location. The differing row is shown below. { - !                 } The other variant, KOI-8 N1, is a subset of KOI-8 N2 which omits the non-Russian Cyrillic letters and mixed single/double lined box drawing characters, leaving them empty for further internationalization (compare with code page 850). The affected rows are shown below. { - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 - !                 } === Lehner‚ÄìCzech modification === An unofficial modification used in software developed by Michael Lehner and Peter R. Czech. It replaces three mathematic symbols with guillemets and the section sign which are commonly used in the Russian language. (Lehner and Czech created a number of alternative character sets for other European languages as well, including one based on CWI-2 for Hungarian, a Kamenicky- based one for Czech and Slovak, a Mazovia variant for Polish and a seemingly- unique encoding for Lithuanian. The modified row is shown below. { - !                 } ===Latvian variant=== A Latvian variant, supported by Star printers and FreeDOS, is code page 3012.

A campaign was begun by Indigenous activists after the death of 16-year-old John Peter Pat died in a police cell in 1983 but gathered steam when several other Indigenous detainees were found dead in their cells, in circumstances believed to be suspicious by their families. In July 1987 Helen Corbett, a representative of the National Committee to Defend Black Rights (CDBR) took their case to the United Nations in July 1987, and it was shortly after this that the government acted on it. Announced on 10 August 1987, the Commission was conducted under the Royal Commissions Act 1902 and various state and federal legislative instruments, such as Letters Patent, which governed its operation and the appointments and revocations of Commissioners. The Northern Territory issued its Letters Patent under its Commission of Inquiry (Deaths in Custody) Act 1987. The Commission was established on 16 October 1987, to inquire why so many Aboriginal Australians had died in custody, and to make recommendations as to how to prevent such deaths in the future. ==Description== The terms of reference for the inquiry limited it to such deaths between 1 January 1980 and 31 May 1989, which meant that it looked at 99 Aboriginal deaths in the custody of prison, police or juvenile detention centres that occurred during this period in Australia. It was mandated to look at the individual circumstances of each death as well as wider social, cultural and legal factors relating to such deaths. 63 of the deaths occurred while the person was in police custody. Federal Court judge James Henry Muirhead, QC, was first appointed Chair of the Commission as the sole Commissioner (leading to the Commission sometimes being referred to as the \\"Muirhead Commission\\"), as the number of deaths had been believed to be about 44. However, after discovering that there was a much larger number of deaths needing investigation under the mandate, five other commissioners were appointed: D.J. O'Dea; Hal Wootten AC, QC; L.F. Wyvill, QC; and Elliott Johnston, QC. Hal Wootten was a former judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales; and Elliott Johnston was a judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia. Johnston replaced Muirhead as the national commissioner on 28 April 1989. The only Indigenous Commissioner, Patrick Dodson, was not legally trained. Muirhead said that his job entailed not just understanding how each person died, but why that person died. While the original terms of reference limited the inquiry to just investigating the deaths, they were later expanded to include looking at any related underlying social, cultural and legal issues. Aboriginal activist Rob Riley was appointed Head of the Aboriginal Issues Unit of the Commission until Ruby Hammond was appointed to the position in 1990. The Commission investigated 99 cases of Aboriginal deaths in custody between 1 January 1980 and 31 May 1989, including the death of rugby player Eddie Murray in 1981 at the Wee Waa police station, and the death of John Pat at Roebourne, Western Australia in 1983, of which Commissioner Johnston was critical of the lack of any disciplinary charges against five officers implicated in the violent death of the 16-year-old Aboriginal boy, calling this \\"a most unsatisfactory state of affairs\\". The Commission held public hearings and community meetings where deaths occurred, with the Inquiry conducting internal and commissioned research. It also received submissions from organisations and individuals, including family members of victims, and delivered issues papers (46, of which 21 were produced by the Commission's research unit). The Commission's Interim Report was issued on 21 December 1988, and the Final Report in April 1991. ==Final report== The final report of the Commission was published in April 1991. The Commission concluded that the 99 deaths investigated were not due to police violence: :\\"... the immediate causes of the deaths do not include foul play, in the sense of unlawful, deliberate killing of Aboriginal prisoners by police and prison officers. More than one-third of the deaths (37) were from disease; 30 were self-inflicted hangings; 23 were caused by other forms of external trauma, especially head injuries; and 9 were immediately associated with dangerous alcohol and other drug use. Indeed, heavy alcohol use was involved in some way in deaths in each of these categories. The chapter concludes that glaring deficiencies existed in the standard of care afforded to many of the deceased\\". The report goes on to say that this \\"in no way diminishes the seriousness of the problem of Aboriginal deaths in custody, nor does it undermine the reasons for the establishment of the Royal Commission. Indeed, the finding that the life styles of the Aboriginal people who died in custody, along with the procedures adopted by custodians and others, are the central determinants of their deaths ...highlights the importance of the Royal Commission' s broad enquiry into the position of Aboriginal people in Australia today and the ways that Aboriginal people are handled by the police and criminal justice systems. It found that the circumstances of each death were very varied (with 63 occurring police custody, 33 in prison custody and 3 in juvenile detention), and one cannot point to a common thread of abuse, neglect or racism common to the them. There were however facts relating to their Aboriginality which pertained to their being in custody and how they died. It found that \\"...there appeared to be little appreciation of and less dedication to the duty of care owed by custodial authorities and their officers to persons in custody. We found many system defects in relation to care, many failures to exercise proper care and in general a poor standard of care. In some cases the defects and failures were causally related to the deaths, in some cases they were not and in others it was open to debate...in many cases death was contributed to by system failures or absence of due care\\". The Royal Commission reported that Aboriginal people in custody died at about the same rate as non-Aboriginal people in custody, but the rate at which they came into custody was much higher, in particular police custody, so the 99 deaths represent that over- representation. Aboriginal people's rate of imprisonment was much higher. The RCIADIC report identified child removal (later dubbed the Stolen Generations) as correlating highly with later likelihood of imprisonment. Aboriginal disadvantage is considered: \\"By all the indicators...Aboriginal people are disadvantaged when compared with any other distinct group in Australian society and with the society as a whole\\". Factors such as the economic position, health indicators, housing, their access or lack of it to land and employment, education; and the part played by alcohol and other drugs are all discussed in the report. ===Recommendations=== In all, there were 339 recommendations made in the report, including: (Also here) *Imprisonment should only occur a last resort; *Medical assistance must be called where necessary; *Better collaboration with Aboriginal communities; *The initiation of a process of reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians; *Statistics and other information on Aboriginal and non- Aboriginal deaths in custody should be monitored nationally on an ongoing basis, by the Australian Institute of Criminology, with the count based on a specific definition (Recommendation no. 6); *Every death in custody in the future, Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal, should be subject to \\"rigorous and accountable investigations and a comprehensive coronial inquiry\\", which had not been the case with some of the deaths identified for the Royal Commission. ==Legacy== A related issue, not investigated by the Commission, is the disproportionately high number of Indigenous Australians who come under some form of custody or who are imprisoned under the law. One of the outcomes of the Commission was the establishment of a National Deaths in Custody Monitoring and Research Program at the Australian Institute of Criminology. The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation was created by an Act of Parliament in September 1991. ==Later reviews and analyses== Many years after RCIADIC, problems persisted, and various criticisms have been made about the Commission. Some blame the lack of commitment by the various governments to properly implement its recommendations; others blame the Commission, saying it was too constrained by its mandate and so could not possibly have achieved the necessary reforms to tackle the marginalisation of Indigenous people. An in- depth analysis of RCIADIC by Elena Marchetti, Senior Lecturer at Griffith Law School, published in 2005, concludes: \\"Despite its many flaws - including the fact that legalistic perspectives were generally privileged at the expense of the more non-orthodox points of view ‚Äì the RCIADIC remains the most comprehensive investigation ever undertaken into the deep disadvantage experienced by Indigenous people as a result of colonisation\\". A 2018 review by Deloitte commissioned in December 2017 by the then Indigenous Affairs Minister, Nigel Scullion, found that only 64% of the recommendations had been fully implemented, and the rate of imprisonment of Indigenous Australians had almost doubled during the 27 years since 1991. It reported that 14% were \\"mostly implemented\\", 16% were \\"partly implemented\\" and 6% not at all. It also found that monitoring of deaths in custody had decreased nationwide, and the quality of data on police custody was ‚Äúan ongoing issue‚Äù. Prison safety had increased, but more staff were needed for mental and other health issues of Aboriginal prisoners. Regular in-cell checks, particularly in police watch houses, were still deficient in some jurisdictions. ==See also== * Aboriginal deaths in custody * Royal Commission Appointed to Investigate, Report and Advise Upon Matters in Relation to the Condition and Treatment of Aborigines (WA, 1934) * Deaths In Custody Watch Committee (WA) Inc ==References== ==External links== * Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, Royal Commission into Category:History of Indigenous Australians Category:Indigenous Australian politics Category:Organisations serving Indigenous Australians Category:Penal system in Australia ","title":"Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody"},{"id":"1436946","text":"The Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service, also known as the Wood Royal Commission was a royal commission held in the State of New South Wales, Australia between 1995 and 1997. The Royal Commissioner was Justice James Roland Wood. The terms of reference were to determine the existence and extent of corruption within the New South Wales Police; specifically, it sought to determine whether corruption and misconduct were \\"systemic and entrenched\\" within the service, and to advise on the process to address such a problem. In 1995, the Commission received letters patent widening the terms of reference to include investigating the activities of organised paedophile networks in New South Wales, the suitability of care arrangements for at-risk minors and the effectiveness of police guidelines for the investigation of sex-offences against minors. == Investigations and powers == The Commission was granted considerable powers, even by the standards of a Royal Commission; in addition to the usual power to compel attendance, the giving of evidence and the production of documents and self-certification of warrants for electronic surveillance and bugs. Commission officers were permitted to carry firearms and were conferred the powers of a constable of the NSW Police Service. Lying to or misleading the Commission was an offence carrying a sentence of up to 6 months imprisonment. However, for no obvious reason, the Commission was denied the power to intercept telephones, and this would prove to be a significant barrier to the Commission in gathering evidence of corruption. In contrast to the usual structure of Royal Commissions, which are staffed primarily by lawyers and administrators, the commission had three investigation teams composed of lawyers, accountants, investigators and current and former officers from every Australian and common-law jurisdiction excepting New South Wales. The commission also acquired the equipment and expertise so that it possessed the sophisticated covert surveillance capabilities it would need to effectively monitor the activities of groups of corrupt police officers and organised criminals. By 1995, the Commission had uncovered hundreds of instances of bribery, money laundering, drug trafficking, fabrication of evidence, destruction of evidence, fraud and serious assaults in the Criminal Investigation Branch (CIB) at Kings Cross. Participation in misconduct was the norm in the detective division and the senior levels of the CIB in Sydney's inner city were in corrupt relationships with major drug traffickers and the local criminal milieu. The Kings Cross detectives received payments akin to a \\"rent\\" from individuals like Bill Bayeh, Steve Hardas and \\"Fat\\" George; the payments totaled thousands of dollars per week, collected by Sergeant Trevor Haken and shared amongst the six Detective Sergeants and the Detective Inspector in charge (Graham \\"Chook\\" Fowler). This corrupt practice was known in police circles as \\"the laugh\\". In 1994, Trevor Haken was summonsed for an examination at the New South Wales Crime Commission. The NSWCC had become aware of his relationship with drug traffickers and his corrupt practices through telephone intercepts that the Royal Commission could not undertake itself. The Wood Royal Commission had assessed Haken as being the individual most likely to co- operate with the Commission in a covert capacity, and took the opportunity to put to Haken an offer to work with the Commission. He agreed and he was instructed by the Commission to simply carry on as normal; his car was fitted with listening devices and cameras to record video and audio. Over the following 6 months, Haken continued to collect payments from traffickers, distribute them to the other corrupt detectives and collected an enormous amount of intelligence and data for the Commission. In 1995, the Commission scheduled a hearing on the Kings Cross police. It summonsed the detective sergeants and \\"Chook\\" Fowler and asked them whether they had ever accepted or asked for a bribe. They emphatically denied they had. Having these denials on the record, the Commission then played video footage and audio recordings from the bugs in Trevor Haken's car. The recordings showed very clearly the handing over of large amounts of cash and discussion of bribes and corrupt activities. Following this bombshell hearing, resistance to the work of the commission from the police service and media crumbled and they were inundated with calls from serving officers seeking to determine whether they could make a deal. The next day, Commissioner Wood declared a conditional amnesty for disclosures of corruption or misconduct by serving officers. The Commissioner emphasised that the goal of the inquiry was to ascertain the prevalence and nature of corruption in the NSW Police and advise on the reforms necessary to address the problem. Removing corrupt officers who would simultaneously provide a full account of their conduct and end their ability to engage in further corrupt practices. It would allow the NSW Police to obtain a large amount of information that would not otherwise come out in criminal proceedings, and it would serve as a clean break for the NSW Police Service. In addition to the Kings Cross hearings, hundreds of police officers were compelled to resign as evidence of wrongdoing and misconduct was brought to light. Specialist officers from the Fraud Enforcement Agency, Armed Holdup Squad, Northwest Regional Crime Squad and Drug Squad were implicated in particularly serious abuses and criminality. A large number of generalist, uniform officers also left the service due to the disclosure of misconduct. == Paedophilia/pederasty enquiry == In 1995, the Independent Commission Against Corruption referred a matter to the Commission regarding the possibility of collusion between organised paedophile networks with members from the legal profession, media and political establishment, and the senior ranks of the NSW Police Service and judiciary. For the purposes of this article, and in the Commission Report Volume 4, the term paedophile is used as an umbrella for sexual offences and behaviours that include paedophilia, pederasty and hebephilia. The allegation of the existence of this conspiracy was made by Colin Fisk, a convicted sex offender and member of such a network; the background to this allegation was his arrest, along with Detective Larry Churchill, for child pornography and drug offences. Fisk alleged the existence of a vast network of prominent individuals from the legal profession, media, political establishment and medical profession who were paedophiles/pederasts and were colluding with senior ranks of the police service to protect its members from prosecution. In pursuing this term of reference, the commission investigated the activities of the particular pederastic/hebephilic network of which Fisk was a member, and its relationship with a group of corrupt NSW Police Service detectives. The network operated as a mutual syndicate and was designed to facilitate the distribution of child pornography, the procuring and sharing of underage sexual partners by members, investment in property such as an underage male brothel in Surry Hills and a pooling of resources and information for the purposes of evading law enforcement and maintaining access to illicit markets. Syndicate members also carried on an amphetamine-trafficking enterprise to raise money to help with the significant expense imposed by the requirement to pay bribes, and the high price of illicit materials and services. The relationship between the network and the group of corrupt detectives was extensive and multifaceted, including regular bribe payments to the detectives in exchange for advance warning of law enforcement scrutiny, consignment of large amounts of methamphetamine to the network members on a profit-sharing bases and the planning of insurance frauds and financial crimes. The detective closest to the network, Larry Churchill, also shared some of the hebephilic tendencies of the network members. The Commission found that the syndicates were effective and efficient in protecting the perpetrators from law enforcement scrutiny and facilitating their criminal activities, and there had been a corrupt relationship between the Fisk syndicate and a group of corrupt officers led by Larry Churchill. The inquiry also conceded that there were probably other such networks and corrupt dealings unknown to them but based on the extensive evidence provided by large numbers of sex-offenders, victims and law enforcement officers, it felt able to put that aside and concentrate on its instruction to examine police procedure and care arrangements for minors. It was highly critical of police, prosecutors and public servants in their approach to the prosecution of sex offences against minors and their lack of specialist police resources and clear guidelines. The Commission made comprehensive recommendations for the reform of care arrangements and police and public service procedures in dealing with child victims of sexual offences. However, the inquiry debunked the most sensational allegations made by Fisk and was emphatic that there was no compelling evidence for the existence of a large network of prominent professionals with paedophile tendencies and a criminal bargain with senior officers of the police service to protect them from prosecution. == Consequences and reform == When the inquiry was first set up, Police Commissioner Tony Lauer stated that corruption in the New South Wales Police was not systemic or entrenched; in fact, he provided a map to the commission purporting to show areas which were guaranteed to be free from any systemic misconduct. The Kings Cross patrol, the most egregious participant in corruption and criminality, was labelled by the Lauer document as being entirely free from corruption. The sensational revelations coming out of the Commission hearings, and his emphatic assertion that corruption was a non-issue, made Tony Lauer's position as Commissioner untenable. He resigned shortly after the publication of the Commission's initial report. Following the Commission hearings, the government felt that the senior ranks of the NSW Police Service were too compromised by personal misconduct or personal ties to corrupt officers meant that no officer could be expected to navigate the reform of the service and implement decisions in the face of bitter opposition from colleagues and former colleagues. Peter Ryan was recruited from the United Kingdom and successfully implemented many of the recommendations of the Commission, including drug testing for serving officers, integrity testing and more thorough supervision. The New South Wales government also undertook a series of legislative changes, which resulted in the majority of recommendations being consolidated in statute. These recommendations included the questioning and investigation procedures that followed arrest.Brown et al, Criminal Laws: Materials and commentary on Criminal Law and Process of New South Wales (The Federation Press, 6th ed, 2015) In addition to reforms of the police service,See, Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (NSW), AustLII the facilities, staff and equipment of the Commission formed the nucleus of the Police Integrity Commission; the PIC retained many of the broad powers held by the Wood Royal Commission and has acted as a standing Royal Commission. The Commission has been criticised as \\"puritanical\\" for overreacting to minor cases of alleged misconduct like the Kareela Cat Burglar case, where senior detectives who were tangentially involved in a case where mace was used on an uncooperative child molester were dismissed from the force 12 years after the event. == In popular culture == The 2009 and 2010 television series Underbelly: A Tale of Two Cities and Underbelly: The Golden Mile were loosely based on the activities of the NSW police service and the Wood Royal Commission with Terry Clark, Robert Trimbole, \\"Chook\\" Fowler, Trevor Haken, Bill Bayeh, George Freeman and Lenny McPherson all portrayed. == References == == External links == * The Kings Cross Sting series exposing what the Wood's Royal Commission missed linking to Kings Cross * Category:1990s in Australia Category:Law enforcement in New South Wales Police Service, Royal Commission into the Category:Corruption in Australia Category:Police misconduct in Australia ","title":"Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service"},{"id":"1436948","text":"GNU Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extensions (GNU Guile) is the preferred extension language system for the GNU Project and features an implementation of the programming language Scheme. Its first version was released in 1993. In addition to large parts of Scheme standards, Guile Scheme includes modularized extensions for many different programming tasks. For extending programs, Guile offers libguile which allows the language to be embedded in other programs, and integrated closely through the C language application programming interface (API); similarly, new data types and subroutines defined through the C API can be made available as extensions to Guile. Guile is used in programs such as GnuCash, LilyPond, GNU Guix, GNU Debugger, GNU TeXmacs and Google's schism. ==Guile Scheme== Guile Scheme is a general-purpose, high-level programming language whose flexibility allows expressing concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C. For example, its hygienic macro system allows adding domain specific syntax-elements without modifying Guile. Guile implements the Scheme standard R5RS, most of R6RS and R7RS, several Scheme Requests for Implementation (SRFI), and many extensions of its own. The core idea of Guile Scheme is that \\"the developer implements critical algorithms and data structures in C or C++ and exports the functions and types for use by interpreted code. The application becomes a library of primitives orchestrated by the interpreter, combining the efficiency of compiled code with the flexibility of interpretation.\\"Blandy 1997, p. 87. Thus Guile Scheme (and other languages implemented by Guile) can be extended with new data types and subroutines implemented through the C API. The standard distribution offers modules for Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) system calls, scheduling, a foreign function interface, S-expression based XML processing through SXML, SXPath, and SXSLT, HTTP and other World Wide Web APIs, delimited continuations, array programming, and other functionality. Guile programs can use facilities from SLIB, the portable Scheme library. ===Implementation details=== When using continuations with call/cc, a requirement of the Scheme standard, Guile copies the execution stack into the heap and back. Because foreign code may have pointers to Scheme objects, Guile uses the conservative Boehm‚ÄìDemers‚ÄìWeiser (BDW) garbage collector. ==History== The Guile manual gives details of the inception and early history of the language. A brief summary follows: After the success of Emacs in the free software community, as a highly extensible and customizable application via its extension (and partly implementation) language Emacs Lisp, the community began to consider how this design strategy could apply to the rest of the GNU system. Tom Lord initially began work on an embeddable language runtime named the GNU Extension Language (GEL), which was based on Aubrey Jaffer's Scheme implementation SCM (which in turn was based on George Carrette's SIOD). Lord convinced Richard Stallman to make GEL the official extension language of the GNU project, based on the argument that Scheme was a cleaner Lisp dialect than Emacs Lisp, and that GEL could evolve to implement other languages on the same runtime, namely Emacs Lisp. After Lord discovered GEL had a naming conflict with another programming language, he solicited suggestions for a new name. From several contributions in several Usenet newsgroups, Lord controversially chose Guile from a suggestion by Lee Thomas. During the development of Guile (then GEL) and before its public release, the extension language Tcl was gaining popularity and being pushed as a universal extension language. Stallman saw Tcl as being underpowered as an extension language, and posted a criticism to the comp.lang.tcl newsgroup, which initiated a flamewar known as the \\"Tcl War\\".Archives of the Tcl War Since the public announcement of the Guile project coincided with the Tcl debate, it has become a common misconception that Guile began as a reaction to this. After the initial release of Guile, development languished for many years, but 2009‚Äì2010 saw major improvements, and Guile 2.0 was released in 2011 with a new compiler infrastructure, a virtual machine implementation, a switch to the Boehm‚ÄìDemers‚ÄìWeiser garbage collector, many improvements to the Guile Scheme language, and other major changes. One of the goals of Guile is to allow other languages to be used alongside Scheme, such that Guile would effectively be a language-neutral runtime environment. Various attempts at this have been made in past versions: a dialect of Scheme essentially differing only in its C-like syntax, a translation of Emacs Lisp, a Tcl converter motivated by tkWWW, and something roughly resembling the language Logo. With version 2.0, the project successfully transitioned to a compiler tower approach, allowing the definition of compilers from one language to another, typically from a higher- level one to a lower-level intermediate representation, and eventually virtual machine bytecode or native machine code. On 16 Mar 2017, Guile 2.2.0 was released with a new optimizing compiler and high-performance register virtual machine. According to the release announcement by Andy Wingo, real-world programs often showed a speedup of 30% or more with Guile 2.2 when compared to the previous 2.0 series. Guile 2.2.0 also lowered memory usage, sped up the \\"eval\\" interpreter, provided better support for multi-core programming, and removed any fixed limit on recursive function calls. It also supported the creation of user-space concurrency facilities that multiplex millions of concurrent lightweight \\"fibers\\" and provided a complete Emacs-compatible Elisp implementation, implementing all of Elisp's features and quirks in the same way as Emacs. On 16 January 2020, Guile 3.0.0 was released with just-in-time (JIT) native code generation for much greater performance. Compared to 2.2, microbenchmark performance is around twice as good on the whole, while some individual benchmarks are up to 32 times as fast. It also featured support for interleaved definitions and expressions in lexical contexts, native support for structured exceptions, better support for the R6RS and R7RS Scheme standards and many optimizations. ===Emacs integration=== There have been several past unfinished attempts to replace or supplement Emacs's Emacs Lisp (Elisp) extension language with Guile, parallel to the efforts of supporting other languages in Guile. With version 2.0 of Guile, a new attempt at implementing Elisp on the Guile compiler tower and replacing Emacs's Elisp implementation with that of libguile has begun and made significant progress through Google Summer of Code projects.

Compiled by Mortimer Adler, an American philosopher, under the guidance of Robert Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago, the volumes were billed as a collection of the 102 great ideas of the western canon. The term ‚Äúsyntopicon‚Äù was coined specifically for this undertaking, meaning ‚Äúa collection of topics.‚ÄùAdler, Mortimer J.. Syntopicon Booklet Draft, Box 4, Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library. The volumes catalogued what Adler and his team deemed to be the fundamental ideas contained in the works of the Great Books of the Western World, which stretched chronologically from Homer to Freud. The Syntopicon lists, under each idea, where every occurrence of the concept can be located in the collection's famous works. The Syntopicon was revised as part of the second edition of the collection. ==History== The Syntopicon was created to set the Great Books collection apart from previously published sets (such as Harvard Classics). Robert Hutchins, at the time, in addition to being the president of the University of Chicago, also served as Chairman of the Board of Editors of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Hutchins and Adler were recruited by the encyclopedia's publisher for a ‚Äúspecial idea‚ÄùAllen, J. S. (1983).

Britannica publisher Senator William Benton joked at the Great Books presentation dinner that ‚Äúthe Syntopicon is said to be the most expensive two volumes editorially in all publishing history.

I‚Äôd like it whenever I can get it.‚ÄùBenton, William. \\"Great Books of the Western World.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Presentation Dinner. Waldorf Astoria, New York City. 15 Apr. 1952. The process of cataloging each appearance of one of the ‚ÄúGreat Ideas‚Äù in all 431 works by 71 authors in the collection was so arduous that the Syntopicon nearly did not make it to print. Before it even came time to print, the budget had topped a million dollars and there was not even ‚Äúa penny for paper‚Äù left.Adler, Mortimer J. Untitled Letter, Box 4, Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library. Adler persevered, however, having spent the previous eight years of his life on the project. He single-handedly raised funds by selling more expensive ‚ÄúFounders Editions‚Äù of the sets, and disobeyed the order to fire his entire staff. There were times, during the process when he admitted: ‚Äúthe question was could we sell the plates for junk! Could we dispose of the plates as old metal?‚Äù Adler felt, through it all, that he was creating something completely new. The Syntopicon, he felt, would be revolutionary, its release on par with such events as the creation of the first dictionary. It would do for ideas what previous reference books had done for words and facts. He worked with a team of over 100 readers who met twice a week for years to discuss the readings and the ideas within them. Among his editorial team was a young Saul Bellow. In the end, he produced two volumes, which listed the 102 Great Ideas of the western world, from Angel to World. The set was released with much fanfare, including an honorary gifting of the first two editions to U.S. President Harry S. Truman and Elizabeth II. An internal memo from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, regarding a release party, reads: ‚ÄúThe projected sequences of events is: (1) Mr. Hutchins kicks off the conference with a discussion of the Great Books movement, and the university‚Äôs and Britannica‚Äôs interest in the set; (2) Mr. Adler tells in detail of the contents of the set and the significance of the Syntopicon; (3) Cocktails.‚ÄùColvin, James. Letter to C. Scott Fletcher. 12 Apr. 1950. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inter Office Correspondence. Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library, Chicago, IL. The second edition of Great Books of the Western World contained six additional volumes of works from the twentieth century, like James Joyce, Max Weber, etc. The second edition of the Syntopicon added, to each of the articles on the great ideas, references to the works in the additional volumes and revisions to the introduction to each great idea to include some mention of how the given idea was understood by the twentieth-century authors in the collection. ==Purpose== In addition to being a ‚Äúspecial idea‚Äù that would set Great Books of the Western World apart, the Syntopicon serves four other purposes, outlined in its preface. The Syntopicon can serve as a reference book, as a book to be read, as an ‚Äúinstrument of liberal education,‚Äù and as ‚Äúan instrument of discovery and research.‚ÄùAdler, Mortimer J. \\"Syntopicon I Preface.\\" Great Books of the Western World. 1st ed. 54 vols. Chicago, IL: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1952. Above all, however, the Syntopicon was created to unite the western world's canon. It was created to solve what Adler saw as a fundamental problem, that ‚Äúdifferent authors say the same thing in different ways, or use the same words to say quite different things.‚ÄùAdler, Mortimer J. Syntopicon Booklet Draft, Box 4, Special Collections Research Center, University of Chicago Library. By cataloging the things the great authors were saying in a more scientific manner, Adler hoped to show the underlying unity that ultimately existed in the collected works. For Hutchins, a chief proponent of classical education, the creation of the Syntopicon held even greater implications. Hutchins felt that the ideas being discussed and cross-listed in the Syntopicon might be \\"powerful enough to save the world from self- destruction.\\"\\"There are Only 102 Great Ideas.\\" Look. Jan. 1948: 58‚Äì61. ==Content== The Syntopicon consists of 102 chapters on the 102 Great Ideas. Each chapter is broken down into five distinct sections: the introduction, an outline of topics, references, cross-references, and additional readings. Adler penned all 102 introductions himself, giving a brief essay on the idea and its connection with the western canon. The outline of topics broke each idea down further, into as many as 15 sub-ideas. For instance, the first idea ‚ÄúAngel‚Äù is broken down into ‚ÄúInferior deities or demi-gods in polytheistic religion,‚Äù ‚Äúthe philosophical consideration of pure intelligences, spiritual substances, supra-human persons‚Äù and seven other subtopics.\\"Syntopicon I.\\" Great Books of the Western World. 1st ed. 54 vols. Chicago, IL: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1952. p. 9. After this is the references section (for instance, ‚Äúinferior deities or demi-gods in polytheistic religion‚Äù can be found in Homer, Sophocles, Shakespeare, Milton, Bacon, Locke, Hegel, Goethe and more). Cross-references follow, where similar ideas are listed. Last is the additional readings, in which one could seek out more on the subject of ‚ÄúAngel.‚Äù The list of 102 ideas is broken between the two volumes, as follows: Volume I: Angel, Animal, Aristocracy, Art, Astronomy, Beauty, Being, Cause, Chance, Change, Citizen, Constitution, Courage, Custom and Convention, Definition, Democracy, Desire, Dialectic, Duty, Education, Element, Emotion, Eternity, Evolution, Experience, Family, Fate, Form, God, Good and Evil, Government, Habit, Happiness, History, Honor, Hypothesis, Idea, Immortality, Induction, Infinity, Judgment, Justice, Knowledge, Labor, Language, Law, Liberty, Life and Death, Logic, and Love.

Full page ads for Time magazine appeared in newspapers across the country, saying ‚ÄúWhat and Why is a Syntopicon?‚Äù\\"TIME Magazine.\\" Advertisement. Chicago Daily News 20 Apr. 1950.

Despite the extensive press coverage and cross-country speeches, however, sales of the Syntopicon and the Great Books of the Western World were slow. Experienced encyclopedia salesmen had to be brought in to move the product, despite Hutchins‚Äô dislike of this solution. The Syntopicon's list was \\"arbitrary\\", as even Adler admitted. The press and others also found problems with the Syntopicon, and despite Adler‚Äôs predictions (‚Äúwe predict that, as dictionaries are indispensable in the realm of words, and encyclopaedias in the realm of facts, so the Syntopicon will become indispensable in the realm of ideas‚Äù ) the Syntopicon has fallen into relative obscurity. At the time of its release, The New York Times Book Review declared: ‚ÄúIts defects are on the surface. One is the implication that great books are concerned only with ideas which can be logically analyzed‚Äîwhereas many masterpieces of literature live in realms partially or wholly outside the realm of logic. Another is the conception that the chief purpose of reading a book is to crack its shell and reach its kernel‚Äîthe form itself being unimportant decoration.‚ÄùHighet, Gilbert. \\"The Great Ideas of the Western World.\\" Rev. of Great Books of the Western World, by Mortimer J. Adler. New York Times Book Review 14 Sept. 1952. ==Subsequent books== In a succeeding book, Adler expressed his regret that the civil rights concept of Equality had not been selected. He attempted to rectify the omission with Six Great Ideas: Truth‚ÄìGoodness‚ÄìBeauty‚ÄìLiberty‚ÄìEquality‚ÄìJustice (1981). Adler attempted another index, in one volume, the Prop√¶dia for the fifteenth edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. A traditional two-volume alphabetical index has since been produced for the more recent versions of the fifteenth edition, in addition to Prop√¶dia. The Syntopicon was republished as The Great Ideas: a Lexicon of Western Thought (1992), a single volume reprint of the commentary on all 102 ideas without including indexing and cross-reference to the Great Works. ==See also== * Great Conversation * Great books ==NotesCenter for the Study of the Great Ideas - The Great Ideas * Center for the Study of the Great Ideas * Syntopicon volume 1 at Archive.org * Syntopicon volume 2 at Archive.org Category:Indexes Category:Lists of books ","title":"A Syntopicon"},{"id":"1436955","text":"New Springville is a neighborhood in Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City, USA. ==History== Located near the island's geographical center, the neighborhood was founded in 1680 in Karle's Neck, so it was later named Karle's Neck Village. By the early 19th century, the community included a dock (on Richmond Creek) and several freshwater springs, leading to its being renamed first Springville, then later New Springville. New Springville remained largely rural until 1964, when the E. J. Korvette department store chain opened an outlet on the site of a former chicken farm. This was followed, in 1973, by the opening of the Staten Island Mall on the grounds of what had been a little-used airport, which changed the character of the neighborhood completely; soon adjacent land was converted to business (mostly retail) use as well. Since then, New Springville has emerged as a commercial and administrative core, rivaling St. George. New Springville has also become a major public transportation hub, second in size on Staten Island only to that of the St. George ferry terminal; six city bus routes serve the area, including one going to Brooklyn, with the terminal at the Staten Island Mall on the Marsh Avenue side (the S79). The Yukon bus depot was opened in the early 1980s and can accommodate 380 buses. The neighborhood is also known for its mafia presence. Some instances: * On September 11, 1989, mob-connected developer Fred Weiss was shot to death outside of his girlfriend's New Springville apartment building. Weiss was indicted, and out of fear that he would cooperate, Gambino crime family boss John Gotti ordered Weiss's murder, and delegated the work to the DeCavalcante crime family. The hit was carried out by James Gallo and Vincent Palermo. The murder would end up resulting in multiple convictions for members of both crime families. * In 1992, bar owner Michael Devine was shot to death in New Springville, allegedly on orders from Colombo family boss Alphonse Persico, because he had been carrying on a relationship with Persico's wife while Persico was imprisoned. * In 2005, Gambino family capo Carmine Sciandra ‚Äì accompanied by two Bonanno gangsters ‚Äì was shot non-fatally outside of his Top Tomato supermarket by a former NYPD officer whose daughter had been an employee at the supermarket. In addition to its explosive development as a business district, New Springville also experienced massive residential growth during the latter third of the 20th century, with thousands of single-family homes being built there, along with apartment and condominium complexes near the Staten Island Mall. In recent years, a new educational complex has been under construction near these apartments and condominiums. Completed is P.S. 58 (Space Shuttle Columbia School), an elementary school, and new intermediate and high schools heve been completed. The 19th-century LaTourette House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ==Transportation== Although New Springville is a major transportation hub and is well served relative to many other parts of Staten Island, it still has transportation problems. The routes serve the area, but have no late-night service/ There are also 6 express bus routes: The SIM4, SIM4C, SIM4X, SIM8, SIM8X and SIM31. Until 1995, New Springville had late-night bus service on the S59 route. , however, there are no overnight buses in New Springville, the closest bus routes to New Springville during the overnight hours are the S74 bus on Arthur Kill Road at the Eltingville Transit Center to the south and the S62 on Victory Boulevard to the north. Both of these routes are very far from the residential portion of New Springville, with the S74 and S62 being located in Eltingville and Bulls Head, respectively. ==Education== New Springville is served by these schools, two of which are expeditionary learning schools: * two public elementary schools (P.S. 58 and P.S. 69), * two intermediate schools (I.S. 72 and the Marsh Avenue School for Expeditionary Learning), and * two high schools (Gaynor McCown Expeditionary Learning School and the College of Staten Island High School for International Studies). ==Demographics== According to the 2010 census, the demographics of New Springville were 68% non-Hispanic White, 2% Black, 16% Asian, and 1% Multiracial. Hispanics or Latinos of any race made up 13% of the population. The neighborhood consists of the census tracts 277.02, 277.04, 277.05, and 277.06. The median household income was estimated to be $66,931. 7.2% of the population lived below the poverty line, making it an average Staten Island community ==References== Category:Neighborhoods in Staten Island Category:Populated places established in 1680 Category:1680 establishments in New York ","title":"New Springville, Staten Island"},{"id":"1436966","text":"The Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) ( (–û–£–ù), ) was a radical far- right Ukrainian ultranationalist political organization established in 1929 in Vienna. The organization first operated in Eastern Galicia (then part of interwar Poland). It emerged as a union between the Ukrainian Military Organization, smaller radical right-wing groups, and right-wing Ukrainian nationalists and intellectuals represented by Dmytro Dontsov, Yevhen Konovalets, Mykola Stsyborsky and other figures. The OUN sought to infiltrate legal political parties, universities and other political structures and institutions. As revolutionary ultra-nationalists the OUN have been characterized by some historians as fascist. OUN strategies to achieve Ukrainian independence included violence and terrorism against perceived foreign and domestic enemies, particularly Poland, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. In 1940 the OUN split into two parts. The older, more moderate members supported Andriy Melnyk and the OUN-M, while the younger and more radical members supported Stepan Bandera's OUN-B. After the start of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 (Operation Barbarossa), the OUN-B in the person of Yaroslav Stetsko declared an independent Ukrainian state on 30 June 1941 in occupied Lviv, while the region was under the control of Nazi Germany. In response, the Nazi authorities suppressed the OUN leadership. In October 1942 the OUN-B established the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA). To pre- empt future Polish efforts at re-establishing Poland's pre-war borders,Timothy Snyder. (2004) The Reconstruction of Nations. New Haven: Yale University Press: pg. 168 in 1943‚Äì1944 some UPA military units carried out large-scale ethnic cleansing against Polish people. Historians estimate that 100,000 Polish civilians were massacred in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia. After World War II the UPA fought against Soviet and Polish government forces. During Operation Vistula in 1947, the Polish government deported 140,000 Ukrainian civilians in Poland to remove the support base for the UPA.\\"Poland's president expresses regret over 1947 Akcja Wisla\\", The Ukrainian Weekly In the struggle Soviet forces killed, arrested, or deported over 500,000 Ukrainian civilians. Many of those targeted by the Soviets included UPA members, their families, and supporters. During and after the Cold War western intelligence agencies, including the CIA, covertly supported the OUN. A number of contemporary far- right Ukrainian political organizations claim to be inheritors of the OUN's political traditions, including Svoboda, the Ukrainian National Assembly and the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists. The role of the OUN remains contested in historiography, as these later political inheritors developed a literature denying the organization's fascist political heritage and collaboration with Nazi Germany, while also celebrating the SS Division Galicia. On the other hand, some scholars argue that political opponents emphasized the far-right or extreme-right aspects of modern OUN descendants for electoral purposes. ==History== ===Background and creation=== Yevhen Konovalets, OUN's leader from 1929 to 1938 In 1919 with the end of the Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War, the Second Polish Republic took over most of the territory claimed by the West Ukrainian National Republic (the rest was absorbed by the Soviet Union). One year later, exiled Ukrainian officers set up the Ukrainian Military Organization (Ukrainian ‚Äì –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ –í—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–æ–≤–∞ –û—Ä–≥–∞–Ω—ñ–∑–∞—Ü—ñ—è: Ukrayins'ka Viys'kova Orhanizatsiya, the UVO), an underground military organization composed of Ukrainian veterans with the goals of continuing the armed struggle against Poland, of destabilizing the political situation, and of preparing disarmed veterans for an anti-Polish uprising. The UVO was strictly a military organization with a military command-structure. Originally the UVO operated under the authority of the exiled government of the Western Ukrainian People's Republic, but in 1925 following a power struggle all the supporters of the Western Ukrainian People's Republic's exiled president Yevhen Petrushevych were expelled. Christopher Gilley (2006). A Simple Question of 'Pragmatism'? Sovietophilism in the West Ukrainian Emigration in the 1920s Working Paper: Koszalin Institute of Comparative European Studies pp.6‚Äì13 Yevhen Konovalets, the former commander of the elite Sich Riflemen unit of the Ukrainian military, led the UVO. West Ukrainian political parties secretly funded the organization. Although it engaged in acts of sabotage and attempted to assassinate the Poland's Chief of State J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski in 1921, it functioned more as a militant protective organization rather than as a terrorist organization.John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pg. 21 When in 1923 the Allies recognized Polish rule over western Ukraine, many members left the organization. The legal Ukrainian parties turned against the UVO's militant actions, preferring to work within the Polish political system. As a result, the UVO turned to Germany and Lithuania for political and financial support. It established contact with militant anti-Polish student organizations, such as the Group of Ukrainian National Youth, the League of Ukrainian Nationalists, and the Union of Ukrainian Nationalist Youth. After preliminary meetings in Berlin in 1927 and Prague in 1928, at the founding congress in Vienna in 1929 the veterans of the UVO and the student militants met and united to form the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. Although the members consisted mostly of Galician youths, Yevhen Konovalets served as its first leader and its leadership council, the Provid, comprised mostly veterans and was based abroad.

Toronto: University of Toronto Press. pp.441‚Äì446. ===Pre-war activities=== At the time of its founding, the OUN was originally a fringe movement in western Ukraine, where the political scene was dominated by the mainstream and moderate Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance (UNDO). This party promoted constitutional democracy and sought to achieve independence through peaceful means. UNDO was supported by the Ukrainian clergy, intelligentsia, and the traditional establishment and published the main western Ukrainian newspaper, '. In contrast, the OUN accepted violence as a political tool against foreign and domestic enemies of their cause. Most of its activity was directed against Polish politicians and government representatives. Under the command of the Western Ukrainian Territorial Executive (established February 1929), the OUN carried out hundreds of acts of sabotage in Galicia and Volhynia, including a campaign of arson against Polish landowners (which helped provoke the 1930 Pacification), boycotts of state schools and Polish tobacco and liquor monopolies, dozens of expropriation attacks on government institutions to obtain funds for its activities, and assassinations. From 1921 to 1939 UVO and OUN carried out 63 known assassinations: 36 Ukrainians (among them one communist), 25 Poles, 1 Russian and 1 Jew.Grzegorz Motyka, Ukrai≈Ñska Partyzantka 1942‚Äì1960, Warszawa 2006 This number is likely an underestimate, because there were likely unrecorded killing in rural regions.Alexander Motyl. (1985). Ukrainian Nationalist Political Violence in Inter-War Poland, 1921‚Äì1939. East European Quarterly, 19:1 (1985:Spring) p.45 Some of the OUN's victims included Tadeusz Ho≈Ç√≥wko, a Polish promoter of Ukrainian/Polish compromise, Emilian Czechowski, Lwow's Polish police commissioner, Alexei Mailov, a Soviet consular official killed in retaliation for the Holodomor, and most notably Bronis≈Çaw Pieracki, the Polish interior minister. The OUN also killed moderate Ukrainian figures such as the respected teacher (and former officer of the military of the West Ukrainian People's Republic) Ivan Babij. Most of these killings were organized locally and occurred without the authorization or knowledge of the OUN's emigre leaders abroad. In 1930 OUN members assaulted the head of the Shevchenko Scientific Society Kyryl Studynsky in his office.Lvivska Hazeta (Lviv Gazette), October 7, 2005. The Art of Compromises: Kyryl Studynsky and Soviet Rule. Article written by Ihor Chornovol Such acts were condemned by the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, Metropolitan Andriy Sheptytsky, who was particularly critical of the OUN's leadership in exile who inspired acts of youthful violence, writing that they were \\"using our children to kill their parents\\" and that \\"whoever demoralizes our youth is a criminal and an enemy of the people.\\"Bohdan Budurowycz. (1989). Sheptytski and the Ukrainian National Movement after 1914 (chapter). In Paul Robert Magocsi (ed.). Morality and Reality: The Life and Times of Andrei Sheptytsky. Edmonton, Alberta: Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Alberta. pg. 57. A more detailed sample of Sheptytsky's impassioned words condemning the OUN, printed in the newspaper of the maninstream western Ukrainian newspaper Dilo: \\"If you are planning to kill treacherously those who are opposed to your misdeeds, you will have to kill all the teachers and professors who are working for the Ukrainian youth, all the fathers and mothers of Ukrainian children...all politicians and civic activists. But first of all you will have to remove through assassination the clergy and the bishops who resist your criminal and foolish actions...We will not cease to declare that whoever demoralizes our youth is a criminal and an enemy of our people.\\" As Polish persecution of Ukrainians during the interwar period increased, many Ukrainians (particularly the youth, many of whom felt they had no future) lost faith in traditional legal approaches, in their elders, and in the western democracies who were seen as turning their backs on Ukraine. This period of disillusionment coincided with the increase in support for the OUN. By the beginning of the Second World War, the OUN was estimated to have 20,000 active members and many times that number in sympathizers. Many bright students, such as the talented young poets Bohdan Kravtsiv and Olena Teliha (executed by the Nazis at Babi Yar) were attracted to the OUN's revolutionary message. As a means to gain independence from Polish and Soviet oppression, before World War II the OUN accepted material and moral support from Nazi Germany. The Germans, needing Ukrainian assistance against the Soviet Union, were expected by the OUN to further the goal of Ukrainian independence. Although some elements of the German military were inclined to do so, they were ultimately overruled by Adolf Hitler and his political organization, whose racial prejudice against the Ukrainians precluded cooperation. ===Split in the OUN=== Stepan Bandera Tensions between young radical Galician students and the older military veteran leadership based abroad existed within the OUN from the beginning. The older generation had the experience of growing up in a stable society and of having fought for Ukraine in regular armies; the younger generation perceived Polish repression and an underground struggle. The leadership abroad, or Provid, thought of itself as an unapproachable elite. Most of the Provid, such as general Mykola Kapustiansky, referred to themselves using their military titles acquired during the war, which the youthful members could never attain. The older faction was also more politically moderate, and adhered to an officer's code of honor and standards of military discipline that prevented them from fully following the belief that any means could be used to achieve the goal. In contrast, the younger faction was more impulsive, violent, and ruthless.John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 39‚Äì42 The older leaders living in exile admired aspects of Benito Mussolini's fascism but condemned Nazism while the younger more radical members based within Ukraine admired fascist ideas and methods as practiced by the Nazis.Paul Robert Magocsi. (1996). A History of Ukraine. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pg. 621 Andriy Melnyk Despite these differences the OUN's leader Yevhen Konovalets thanks to his considerable political skill and reputation was able to command enough respect to maintain unity between both groups within the organization. This was shattered when Konovalets was assassinated by a Soviet agent, Pavel Sudoplatov, in Rotterdam in May, 1938. Andriy Melnyk, a 48-year- old former colonel in the army of the Ukrainian People's Republic and one of the founders of the Ukrainian Military Organization was chosen to lead the OUN despite not having been involved in political or terrorist activities throughout the 1930s. Melnyk was more friendly to the Church than were any of his associates (the OUN was generally anti-clerical), and had even became the chairman of a Ukrainian Catholic youth organization that was regarded as anti- Nationalist by many OUN members. His choice was seen as an attempt by the leadership to repair ties with the Church and to become more pragmatic and moderate. However, this direction was opposite to the trend within western Ukraine itself.John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 36‚Äì39 \\"saboteur\\". April 1941 General Government The Galician youths formed the majority of the membership. Due to their presence in western Ukraine rather than in exile abroad, they faced the danger of arrest and imprisonment. Yet, they were shut out of the leadership. After failing to come to an agreement with their elder leaders in the Provid, in August 1940 they held their own leadership conference, choosing Stepan Bandera, who as an iron-willed, extremist conspirator was in many ways the opposite of the cautious, moderate and dignified Melnyk. On the eve of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the OUN was thus divided into two competing and hostile factions: the \\"legitimate\\" OUN-M headed by Andrii Melnyk and the OUN-B (or OUN-R for \\"revolutionary\\") headed by Stepan Bandera. Each group had its strengths. The OUN-M retained the loyalty of some youths in Galicia as well as a majority of the youths in the regions of Bukovyna and Trancarpathia, whose political leader monsignor Avgustyn Voloshyn praised Melnyk as a Christian of European culture, in contrast to many nationalists who placed the nation above God. The OUN-M's leadership was more experienced and had some limited contacts in Eastern Ukraine; it also maintained contact with German intelligence and the Germany army.John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pg. 87 The OUN-B, on the other hand, enjoyed the support of the majority of the nationalistic Galician youth, who formed the backbone of the underground Ukrainian nationalist movement. It had a strong network of devoted followers and was powerfully aided by Mykola Lebed, who began to organize the feared Sluzhba Bezpeky or SB, a secret police force modelled on the Cheka with a reputation for ruthlessness. Within the Bandera group but somewhat apart from its political leaders such as Stepan Bandera or Mykola Lebed were a number of young Galicians who were less concerned with ideology and whose interests were primarily pragmatic and military. The most prominent among them was Roman Shukhevych. This group was not yet very significant, although their importance would increase rapidly later,John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pg. 63 during the period of OUN war-time activity. ===During World War II=== ====Early years of the war and activities in Central and Eastern Ukraine==== An OUN-B leaflet from the World War II. After the invasion of Poland in September 1939, both factions of the OUN collaborated with the Germans and used the opportunity of the invasion to send their activists into Soviet-controlled territory. OUN-B leader Stepan Bandera held meetings with the heads of Germany's intelligence, regarding the formation of Ukrainian staffed forces. On February 25, 1941, the head of Abwehr Wilhelm Franz Canaris sanctioned the creation of the \\"Ukrainian Legion\\" under German command. The formation was planned to have 800 persons. OUN-B expected that it would become the core of the future Ukrainian army. In the spring of 1941 the Legion was organized as two units; one unit became known as Nachtigall Battalion, while the other became the Roland Battalion.–Ü.–ö. –ü–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–ª—è–∫. –í—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–æ–≤–∞ –¥—ñ—è–ª—å–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç—å –û–£–ù(–ë) —É 1940‚Äî1942 —Ä–æ–∫–∞—Ö. ‚Äî –£–Ω—ñ–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—Ç–µ—Ç —ñ–º–µ–Ω—ñ –®–µ–≤—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ \\\\–Ü–Ω-—Ç —ñ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—ó –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ –ù–ê–ù –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ –ö–∏—ó–≤, 2004 (No ISBN) p.271-278 Eight days after Germany's invasion of the USSR, on June 30, 1941, the OUN-B proclaimed the establishment of Ukrainian State in Lviv, with Yaroslav Stetsko as premier. One of the versions of the \\"Act of Proclamation of Ukrainian State\\" signed by Stepan Bandera In response to the declaration, OUN-B leaders and associates were arrested and imprisoned by the Gestapo (ca.1500 personshttp://www.history.org.ua/LiberUA/Book/Upa/4.pdf). Many OUN-B members were killed outright, or perished in jails and concentration camps (both of Bandera's brothers were eventually murdered at Auschwitz). On September 18, 1941 Bandera and Stetsko were sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp in \\"Zellenbau Bunker\\". Bandera was imprisoned along with some of the most important prisoners of the third Reich, such as the ex-prime minister of France L√©on Blum and ex-chancellor of Austria, Kurt Schuschnigg. The prisoners of Zellenbau received help from the Red Cross unlike common concentration camp prisoners and were able to send and receive parcels from their relatives. Bandera also received help from the OUN-B including financial assistance. The Germans permitted the Ukrainian nationalists to leave the bunker for important meeting with OUN representatives in Fridental Castle which was 200 meters from Sachsenhausen.,A.B. Shirokorad, Uteryannie zemli Rossii: otkolovshiesya respubliki, Moscow:\\"Veche\\", 2007, p. 84. where they were kept until September 1944. As a result of the German crackdown on the OUN-B, the faction controlled by Melnyk enjoyed an advantage over its rival and was able to occupy many positions in the civil administration of former Soviet Ukraine during the first months of German occupation. The first city which it administered was Zhitomir, the first major city across the old Soviet-Polish border. Here, the OUN-M helped stimulate the development of Prosvita societies, the appearance of local artists on Ukrainian-language broadcasts, the opening of two new secondary schools and a pedagogical institute, and the establishment of a school administration. Many locals were recruited into the OUN-M. The OUN-M also organized police forces, recruited from Soviet prisoners of war. Two senior members of its leadership, or Provid, even came to Zhitomir. At the end of August 1941, however, they were both gunned down, allegedly by the OUN-B which had justified the assassination in their literature and had issued a secret directive (referred to by Andriy Melnyk as a \\"death sentence\\") not to allow OUN-M leaders to reach Ukrainian SSR's capital Kiev (now Kyiv, Ukraine). In retaliation, the German authorities, often tipped off by OUN-M members, began mass arrests and executions of OUN-B members, to a large extent eliminating it in much of central and eastern Ukraine.John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 91‚Äì98. As the Wehrmacht moved East, the OUN-M established control of Kiev's civil administration; that city's mayor from October 1941 until January 1942, Volodymyr Bahaziy, belonged to the OUN-M and used his position to funnel money into it and to help the OUN-M take control over Kiev's police.John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 114‚Äì117. The OUN-M also initiated the creation of the Ukrainian National Council in Kiev, which was to become the basis for a future Ukrainian government.Paul Robert Magocsi. (1996). A History of Ukraine. Toronto: University of Toronto Press: pg. 629. At this time, the OUN-M also came to control Kiev's largest newspaper and was able to attract many supporters from among the central and eastern Ukrainian intelligentsia. Alarmed by the OUN-M's growing strength in central and eastern Ukraine, the German Nazi authorities swiftly and brutally cracked down on it, arresting and executing many of its members in early 1942, including Volodymyr Bahaziy, and the writer Olena Teliha who had organized and led the League of Ukrainian Writers in Kiev. Although during this time elements within the Wehrmacht tried in vain to protect OUN-M members, the organization was largely wiped out within central and eastern Ukraine. ====OUN-B's struggle for dominance in western Ukraine==== As the OUN-M was being wiped out in the regions of central and western Ukraine that had been east of the old Polish-Soviet border, in Volhynia the OUN-B, with easy access from its base in Galicia, began to establish and consolidate its control over the nationalist movement and much of the countryside. Unwilling and unable to openly resist the Germans in early 1942, it methodically set about creating a clandestine organization, engaging in propaganda work, and building weapons stockpiles.John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 142‚Äì165. A major aspect of its programme was the infiltration of the local police; the OUN-B was able to establish control over the police academy in Rivne. By doing so the OUN-B hoped to eventually overwhelm the German occupation authorities (\\"If there were fifty policemen to five Germans, who would hold power then?\\"). In their role within the police, Bandera's forces were involved in the extermination of Jewish civilians and the clearing of Jewish ghettos, actions that contributed to the OUN-B's weapon stockpiles. In addition, blackmailing Jews served as a source of added finances.Ukrainian Collaboration in the Extermination of the Jews during the Second World War: Sorting Out the Long- Term and Conjunctural Factors by John-Paul Himka, University of Alberta. Taken from The Fate of the European Jews, 1939‚Äì1945: Continuity or Contingency, ed. Jonathan Frankel (New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), Studies in Contemporary Jewry 13 (1997): 170‚Äì89. During the time that the OUN-B in Volhynia was avoiding conflict with the German authorities and working with them, resistance to the Germans was limited to Soviet partisans on the extreme northern edge of the region, to small bands of OUN-M fighters, and to a group of guerillas knowns as the UPA or the Polessian Sich, unaffiliated with the OUN-B and led by Taras Bulba-Borovets of the exiled Ukrainian People's Republic. By late 1942, the status quo for the OUN-B was proving to be increasingly difficult. The German authorities were becoming increasingly repressive towards the Ukrainian population, and the Ukrainian police were reluctant to take part in such actions. Furthermore, Soviet partisan activity threatened to become the major outlet for anti-German resistance among western Ukrainians. By March 1943, the OUN-B leadership issued secret instructions ordering their members who had joined the German police in 1941‚Äì1942, numbering between 4,000‚Äì5,000 trained and armed soldiers, to desert with their weapons and to join the units of the OUN-B in Volyn. –û—Ä–≥–∞–Ω—ñ–∑–∞—Ü—ñ—è —É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∏—Ö –Ω–∞—Ü—ñ–æ–Ω–∞–ª—ñ—Å—Ç—ñ–≤ —ñ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ –ø–æ–≤—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ –∞—Ä–º—ñ—è p.165 Borovets attempted to unite his UPA, the smaller OUN-M and other nationalist bands, and the OUN-B underground into an all-party front. The OUN-M agreed, while the OUN-B refused, in part due to the insistence of the OUN-B that their leaders be in control of the organization. After negotiations failed, the OUN commander Dmytro Klyachkivsky coopted the name of Borovets' organization, UPA, and decided to accomplish by force what could not be accomplished through negotiation: the unification of Ukrainian nationalist forces under OUN-B control. On July 6, the large OUN-M group was surrounded and surrendered, and soon afterward most of the independent groups disappeared; they were either destroyed by the Communist partisans or the OUN-B, or joined the latter. On August 18, 1943, Taras Bulba-Borovets and his headquarters was surrounded in a surprise attack by OUN-B force consisting of several battalions. Some of his forces, including his wife, were captured, while five of his officers were killed. Borovets escaped but refused to submit, in a letter accusing the OUN-B of among other things: banditry; of wanting to establish a one-party state; and of fighting not for the people but in order to rule the people. In retaliation, his wife was murdered after two weeks of torture at the hands of the OUN-B's SB. In October 1943 Bulba-Borovets largely disbanded his depleted force in order to end further bloodshed.Institute of Ukrainian History, Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army Chapter 3 pp. 152‚Äì153 http://history.org.ua/oun_upa/upa/9.pdf In their struggle for dominance in Volhynia, the Banderists would kill tens of thousands of Ukrainians for links to Bulba-Borovets or Melnyk.Timothy Snyder. (2004) The Reconstruction of Nations. New Haven: Yale University Press: pg. 164 ====OUN-B's struggle against Germany, Soviet Union and Poland==== By the fall of 1943 the OUN-B forces had established their control over substantial portions of rural areas in Volhynia and southwestern Polesia. While the Germans controlled the large towns and major roads, such a large area east of Rivne had come under the control of the OUN-B that it was able to set about creating a \\"state\\" system with military training schools, hospitals and a school system, involving tens of thousands of personnel.John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pg. 156 Its military, the UPA, which came under the command of Roman Shukhevich in August 1943, would fight against the Germans and later the Soviets until the mid-1950s. It would also play a major role in the genocide of the Polish population from western Ukraine. For more information about the UPA, see: Ukrainian Insurgent Army. ===After the Second World War=== After the war, the OUN in eastern and southern Ukraine continued to struggle against the Soviets; 1958 marked the last year when an OUN member was arrested in Donetsk. Both branches of the OUN continued to be quite influential within the Ukrainian diaspora. The OUN-B formed, in 1943, an organization called the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations (headed by Yaroslav Stetsko). The Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations it created and headed would include at various times emigre organizations from almost every eastern European country with the exception of Poland: Croatia, the Baltic countries, anti-communist emigre Cossacks, Hungary, Georgia, Bohemia-Moravia (today the Czech Republic), and Slovakia. In the 1970s the ABN was joined by anti- communist Vietnamese and Cuban organizations.Encyclopedia of Ukraine, Anti- Bolshevik Bloc of Nations In 1956 Bandera's OUN split into two parts,Institute of Ukrainian History, Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army Chapter 8 pp. 462‚Äì463 http://www.history.org.ua/LiberUA/Book/Upa/30.pdf the more moderate OUN(z) led by Lev Rebet and Zinoviy Matla, and the more conservative OUN led by Stepan Bandera. Euromaidan in Kyiv, December 2013. Protesters with OUN-B flag. After the fall of Communism both OUN factions resumed activities within Ukraine. The Melnyk faction threw its support behind the Ukrainian Republican Party at the time that it was headed by Levko Lukyanenko. The OUN-B reorganized itself within Ukraine as the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists (KUN) (registered as a political party in January 1993 –ö–æ–Ω–≥—Ä–µ—Å—Å –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∏—Ö –ù–∞—Ü—ñ–æ–Ω–∞–ª—ñ—Å—Ç—ñ–≤, Database DATA). Its conspirational leaders within the diaspora did not want to openly enter Ukrainian politics, and attempted to imbue this party with a democratic, moderate facade. However, within Ukraine the project attracted more primitive nationalists who took the party to the right.Andrew Wilson. (1997). Ukrainian Nationalism in the 1990s: a Minority Faith. Cambridge University Press. Until her death in 2003, KUN was headed by Slava Stetsko, widow of Yaroslav Stetsko, who also simultaneously headed the OUN and the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations. On March 9, 2010 the OUN rejected Yulia Tymoshenko's calls to unite \\"all of the national patriotic forces\\" led Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko against President Viktor Yanukovych. OUN did demand that Yanukovych should reject the idea of cancelling the Hero of Ukraine status given to Stepan Bandera and Roman Shukhevych, Yanukovych should continue the practice of recognizing fighters for Ukraine's independence, which was launched by (his predecessor) Viktor Yushchenko, and posthumously award the Hero of Ukraine titles to Symon Petliura and Yevhen Konovalets.OUN rejects Tymoshenko's calls to form united opposition, Kyiv Post (March 9, 2010) On 19 November 2018 Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and fellow Ukrainian nationalist political organizations Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, Right Sector and C14 endorsed Ruslan Koshulynskyi's candidacy in the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election.

Originally the Vozhd was Yevhen Konovalets ; after his assassination he was succeeded by Andriy Melnyk resulting in a split where the Galician youths followed their own Vozhd, Stepan Bandera. Underneath the Vozhd were the Provid, or directorate. At the start of the second world war the OUN's leadership consisted of the Vozhd, Andrii Melnyk, and eight members of the Provid.John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 33‚Äì36. The Provid members were: Generals Kurmanovych and Kapustiansky (both generals from the times of Ukraine's revolution in 1918‚Äì1920); Yaroslav Baranovsky, a law student; Dmytro Andriievsky, a politically moderate former diplomat of the revolutionary government from eastern Ukraine; Richard Yary, a former officer of the Austrian and Galician militaries who served as a liaison with the German Abwehr; colonel Roman Sushko, another former Austrian and Galician officer; Mykola Stsyborsky, the son of a tsarist military officer from Zhytomir, who served as the OUN's official theorist; and Omelian Senyk, a party organizer and veteran of the Austrian and Galician armies who by the 1940s was considered too moderate and too conservative by the youngest generation of Galician youths. Yary would be the only member of the original Provid to join Bandera after the OUN split.John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pg. 62. ==Ideology== The OUN was formed from a number of radical nationalist and extreme right-wing organizations including the Union of Ukrainian Fascists. Initially, it was led by war veterans who failed to establish a Ukrainian state in 1917‚Äì1920. The ideology of the organization was heavily influenced by the philosophy of Nietzsche, German National Socialism and Italian Fascism; combining extreme nationalism with terrorism, corporatism, and anti-Semitism, as well as totalitarianism and anti-democracy. In order to create an illusion that the Ukrainian brand of nationalism was a product of domestic development, most early OUN writers denied their ideological connection to fascism in a self-deceptive manner, contradicting generally known facts. The OUN viewed the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church as a rival and condemned Catholic leaders as police informers or potential informers; the Church rejected integral nationalism as incompatible with Christian ethics. The conflict between the OUN and the Church eased in the late 1930s.Myroslav Shkandrij.(2015). National democracy, the OUN, and Dontsovism: Three ideological currents in Ukrainian Nationalism of the 1930s‚Äì40s and their shared myth-system\\".Communist and Post-Communist Studies 1‚Äì8 According to its initial declaration, the primary goal of OUN was to establish an independent and ethnically pure Ukrainian state. This goal was to be achieved by a national revolution, that would drive out all foreign element and set up an authoritarian state led by a strong man. The OUN's leadership felt that past attempts at securing independence failed due to democratic values in society, poor party discipline and a conciliatory attitude towards Ukraine's traditional enemies. Its ideology rejected the socialist ideas supported by Petliura, and the compromises of Galicia's traditional elite. Instead the OUN, particularly its younger members, adopted the ideology of Dmytro Dontsov, an √©migr√© from Eastern Ukraine. ===Integral nationalism=== The Ukrainian nationalism of the 19th and early 20th centuries had been largely liberal or socialist, combining Ukrainian national consciousness with patriotism and humanist values. In contrast, the nationalists who emerged in Galicia following the First World War, much as in the rest of Europe, adopted the form of nationalism known as Integral nationalism. According to this ideology, the nation was held to be of the highest absolute value, more important than social class, regions, the individual, religion, etc. To this end, OUN members were urged to \\"force their way into all areas of national life\\" such as institutions, societies, villages and families. Politics was seen as a Darwinian struggle between nations for survival, rendering conflict unavoidable and justifying any means that would lead to the victory of one's nation over that of others. In this context willpower was seen as more important than reason, and warfare was glorified as an expression of national vitality. Integral nationalism became a powerful force in much of Europe during the 1920s and 1930s. The OUN's conceptualization of this idea was particular in several ways. Because Ukraine was stateless and surrounded by more powerful neighbors, the emphasis on force and warfare was to be expressed in acts of terrorism rather than open warfare, and illegality was glorified. Because Ukrainians did not have a state to glorify or serve, the emphasise was placed on a \\"pure\\" national language and culture rather than a State. There was a strain of fantastic romanticism, in which the unsophisticated Ukrainian rejection of reason was more spontaneous and genuine than the cynical rejection of reason by German or Italian integral nationalists.John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 20‚Äì22 ===Myth and nationalism of the deed=== Dmytro Dontsov claimed that the 20th century would witness the \\"twilight of the gods to whom the nineteenth century prayed\\" and that a new man must be created, with the \\"fire of fanatical commitment\\" and the \\"iron force of enthusiasm\\", and that the only way forward was through \\"the organization of a new violence.\\" This new doctrine was the chynnyi natsionalizm ‚Äì the \\"nationalism of the deed\\". To dramatize and spread such views, OUN literature mythologized the cult of struggle, sacrifice, and emphasized national heroes. The OUN, particularly Bandera, held a romantic view of the Ukrainian peasantry, glorified the peasants as carriers of Ukrainian culture and linked them with the deeds and exploits of the Ukrainian Cossacks from previous centuries. The OUN believed that a goal of professional revolutionaries was, through revolutionary acts, to awaken the masses. In this aspect the OUN had much in common with 19th-century Russian Narodniks.Bandera ‚Äì romantyczny terrorysta \\"Bandera ‚Äì Romantic Terrorist, interview with Jaroslaw Hrycak. Gazeta Wyborcza, May 10, 2008. ===Authoritarianism=== The nation was to be unified under a single party led by a hierarchy of proven fighters. At the top was to be a Supreme Leader, or Vozhd. In some respects the OUN's creed was similar to that of other eastern European, radical right- wing agrarian movements, such as Romania's Legion of the Archangel Michael, Croatia's Ustashe, Hungary's Arrow Cross Party, and similar groups in Slovakia and Poland. There were, however, significant differences within the OUN regarding the extent of its totalitarianism. The more moderate leaders living in exile admired some facets of Benito Mussolini's fascism but condemned Nazism while the younger more radical members based within Ukraine admired the fascist ideas and methods as practiced by the Nazis. The faction based abroad supported rapprochement with the Ukrainian Catholic Church while the younger radicals were anti-clerical and felt that not considering the Nation to be the Absolute was a sign of weakness. The two factions of the OUN each had their own understanding of the nature of the leader. The Melnyk faction considered the leader to be the director of the Provid and in its writings emphasized a military subordination to the hierarchical superiors of the Provid. It was more autocratic than totalitarian. The Bandera faction, in contrast, emphasized complete submission to the will of the supreme leader.John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 38‚Äì39. At a party congress in August 1943, the OUN-B rejected much of its fascistic ideology in favor of a social democratic model, while maintaining its hierarchical structure. This change could be attributed in part to the influence of the leadership of Roman Shukhevych, the new leader of UPA, who was more focused on military matters rather than on ideology and was more receptive to different ideological themes than were the fanatical OUN-B political leaders, and was interested in gaining and maintaining the support of deserters or others from Eastern Ukraine. During this party congress, the OUN-B backed off its commitment to private ownership of land, increased worker participation in management of industry, equality for women, free health services and pensions for the elderly, and free education. Some points in the program referred to the rights of national minorities and guaranteed freedom of speech, religion, and the press and rejected the official status of any doctrine. Nevertheless, the authoritarian elements were not discarded completely and were reflected in continued insistence on the \\"heroic spirit\\" and \\"social solidarity, friendship and discipline.\\"John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 159‚Äì165 In exile, the OUN's ideology was focused on opposition to communism. ===Treatment of non-Ukrainians=== The OUN intended to create a Ukrainian state with widely understood Ukrainian territories, but inhabited by Ukrainian people narrowly understood, according to Timothy Snyder. Its first congress in 1929 resolved that \\"Only the complete removal of all occupiers from Ukrainian lands will allow for the general development of the Ukrainian Nation within its own state.\\" OUN's \\"Ten Commandments\\" stated: \\"Aspire to expand the strength, riches, and size of the Ukrainian State even by means of enslaving foreigners\\" or \\"Thou shalt struggle for the glory, greatness, power, and space of the Ukrainian state by enslaving the strangers\\". This formulation was modified by OUN's theoreticians in the 1950s and shortened to \\"Thou shalt struggle for the glory, greatness, power, and space of the Ukrainian state\\". ===OUN and antisemitism=== Antisemitism was an attribute OUN shared with other agrarian radical right-wing Eastern European organizations, such as the Croatian Ustashe, the Yugoslav Zbor and Romania's Legion of the Archangel Michael.Subtelny, Orest. (1988) Ukraine: a History. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pg. 442Volovici, Nationalist Ideology, p. 98, citing N. Cainic, Ortodoxie ≈üi etnocra≈£ie, pp. 162‚Äì4 The OUN's ideology, on the other hand, did not emphasize antisemitism and racism despite the presence of some antisemitic writing. Indeed, three of its leaders, General Mykola Kapustiansky, Rico Yary (himself of Hungarian-Jewish descent), and Mykola Stsyborsky (the OUN's chief theorist), were married to Jewish womenKost Bondarenko, Director of the Center for Political Research, The History We Don't Know or Don't Care to Know, Mirror Weekly, #12, 2002 and Jews belonged to the OUN's underground movement.Philip Friedman. Ukrainian-Jewish Relations During the Nazi Occupation. In Roads to Extinction: Essays on the Holocaust. (1980) New York: Conference of Jewish Social Studies. pg. 204 The OUN in the early 1930s considered Ukraine's primary enemies to be Poles and Russians, with Jews playing a secondary role or not considered an enemy. An article published in 1930 by OUN leader Mykola Stsyborsky denounced the anti-Jewish pogroms of 1918, stating that most of its victims were innocent rather than Bolsheviks. Stsyborsky wrote that Jewish rights should be respected, that the OUN ought to convince Jews that their organization was no threat to them, and that Ukrainians ought to maintain close contacts with Jews nationally and internationally.Myroslav Shkandrij. (2009). 'Jews in Ukrainian Literature: Representation and Identity.' New Haven: Yale University Press, pp. 152‚Äì153 Three years later, an article in the OUN journal Rozbudova Natsii (\\"Development of the Nation\\"), despite its focus on Jews' alleged exploitation of Ukrainian peasants, also stated that Jews as well as Ukrainians were victims of Soviet policies. By the late 1930s, the OUN attitude towards Jews grew more negative. Jews were described in OUN publications as parasites who ought to be segregated from Ukrainians. For example, an article titled \\"The Jewish Problem in Ukraine\\" published in 1938 called for Jews' complete cultural, economic and political isolation from Ukrainians, rejecting forced assimilation of Jews but allowing that they ought to enjoy the same rights as Ukrainians. Despite the increasingly negative portrayal of Jews, for all of its glorification of violence Ukrainian nationalist literature generally showed little interest in Nazi-like antisemitism during the 1930s. Evhen Onatsky, writing in the OUN's official journal in 1934, condemned German National Socialism as imperialist, racist and anti-Christian.Myroslav Yurkevich. (1986). Galician Ukrainians in German Military Formations and in the German Administration. In Ukraine during World War II: history and its aftermath : a symposium (Yuri Boshyk, Roman Waschuk, Andriy Wynnyckyj, Eds.). Edmonton: University of Alberta, Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies Press pg. 69 German documents from the early 1940s give the impression that extreme Ukrainian nationalists were indifferent to the plight of the Jews; they were willing to either kill them or help them, whichever was more appropriate, for their political goals. The OUN-B's ambivalent wartime attitude towards the Jews was highlighted during the Second General Congress of OUN-B (April, 1941, Krak√≥w)in which the OUN-B condemned anti-Jewish pogroms.Jaros≈Çaw Hrycak, Ukrai≈Ñcy w akcjach anty≈ºydowskich. Appeared in the journal Nowa Europa Wschodnia and specifically warned against the pogromist mindset as useful only to Muscovite propaganda.Hunczak, Ukrainian-Jewish Relations, p.41 At that conference the OUN-B declared \\"The Jews in the USSR constitute the most faithful support of the ruling Bolshevik regime, and the vanguard of Muscovite imperialism in Ukraine. The Muscovite-Bolshevik government exploits the anti- Jewish sentiments of the Ukrainian masses to divert their attention from the true cause of their misfortune and to channel them in a time of frustration into pogroms on Jews. The OUN combats the Jews as the prop of the Muscovite- Bolshevik regime and simultaneously it renders the masses conscious of the fact that the principal foe is Moscow.\\"Philip Friedman. Ukrainian-Jewish Relations During the Nazi Occupation. In Roads to Extinction: Essays on the Holocaust. (1980) New York: Conference of Jewish Social Studies. pp.179‚Äì180 On the other hand, the OUN was willing to support Nazi antisemitic policies if doing so would help their cause. The OUN sought German recognition for an independent Ukrainian state. Despite its declared condemnation of pogroms in April 1941, when German official Reinhard Heydrich requested \\"self-cleansing actions\\" in June of that year the OUN organized militias who killed several thousand Jews in western Ukraine soon afterward that year.The Lviv pogrom of 1941 By John Paul Himka. Kyiv Post September 23, 2010. The Ukrainian People's Militia under the OUN's command led pogroms that resulted in the massacre of 6,000 Jews in Lviv soon after that city's fall to German forces.

The author of the OUN emblem with stylized trident (nationalistic trident) was R. Lisovsky. The organization's anthem \\"We were born in a great hour\\" () was finalized in 1934 and also was published in the same magazine. Its lyrics were written by Oles Babiy, while music, by composer Omelian Nyzhankivsky. For long time OUN did not officially have its own flag, however during the Hungarian campaign against the Republic of Carpathian Ukraine in 1939, Carpathian Sich, a militarized wing of OUN, adopted its flag from the OUN's emblem ‚Äì golden nationalistic trident on a blue background. The flag was finalized and officially adopted by the organization only in 1964 at the 5th Assembly of Ukrainian Nationalists. During the World War II in 1941 OUN split. The newly created organization, OUN-revolutionary, was headed by Stepan Bandera (hence sometimes is known as OUN-B). OUN-r refused to adopt the nationalistic trident as a symbol and came up with its own heraldry. As the original OUN emblem previously, Robert Lisovskyi created in 1941 the organizational emblem for OUN-r as well. The central element of the new emblem was a stylized cross within a triangle. According to Bohdan Hoshovsky, the combination of colors red and black was based on a concept of the OUN ideologue and a veteran of the Ukrainian Galician Army, Yulian Vassian.Hoshovsky, B.

This meant that for the first time they could receive veteran benefits, including free public transport, subsidized medical services, annual monetary aid, and public utilities discounts (and will enjoy the same social benefits as former Ukrainian soldiers Red Army of the Soviet Union).Former WWII nationalist guerrillas granted veteran status in Ukraine, Kyiv Post (26 March 2019) There had been several previous attempts to provide former Ukrainian nationalist fighters with official veteran status, especially during the 2005‚Äì2009 administration President Viktor Yushenko, but all failed. ==Leaders== * 1929 ‚Äì 1938 Yevhen Konovalets * 1938 ‚Äì 1940 Andriy Melnyk ===OUN (Melnyk)=== * 1940 ‚Äì 1964 Andriy Melnyk * 1964 ‚Äì 1977 Oleh Shtul * 1977 ‚Äì 1979 Denys Kvitkovskyi * 1979 ‚Äì 2012 Mykola Plaviuk * 2012 ‚Äì Bohdan Chervak ===OUN (Bandera)=== * 1940 ‚Äì 1959 Stepan Bandera * 1959 ‚Äì 1968 Stepan Lenkavskyi * 1968 ‚Äì 1986 Yaroslav Stetsko * 1986 ‚Äì 1991 Vasyl Oleskiv * 1991 ‚Äì 2001 Slava Stetsko * 2001 ‚Äì 2009 Andriy Haidamakha * 2009 ‚Äì Stefan Romaniv ===OUN (abroad)=== * 1954 ‚Äì 1956 Zenon Matla * 1956 ‚Äì 1957 Lev Rebet * 1957 ‚Äì ????

Stefan Kiszko ( ), an intellectually disabled young man who lived near Molseed in Greater Manchester, was wrongly convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering her, and served 16 years in prison before the conviction was overturned. Kiszko's mental and physical condition deteriorated while he was in prison, and he died 20 months after his release in 1992, before he could collect money owed to him for his suffering. His ordeal was described by one British MP as \\"the worst miscarriage of justice of all time.\\" Evidence that Kiszko could not have committed the crime was suppressed by three members of the investigation team, who were initially arrested in 1993 before charges were dropped. In 2006, however, a DNA match led to the arrest of Ronald Castree for Molseed's murder. He was convicted the following year and sentenced to life in prison. ==Murder== Lesley Susan Molseed (14 August 1964 ‚Äì 5 October 1975), was a child who lived at 11 Delamere Road, Rochdale, Greater Manchester, part of the Turf Hill Estate. Known as \\"Lel\\" to her mother (April), step-father (Danny), brother, and two sisters, she had been born with a congenital cardiac condition. When she was three, she had open-heart surgery to rectify her illness, but the procedure affected her health and development, and she remained frail and with a reduced mental level for her age. Around lunchtime on Sunday, 5 October 1975, she was asked by her mother to go from her home to a local shop on nearby Ansdell Road to buy bread and air-freshener. The children had a rota for chores and for Lesley such an errand would have been considered a routine one in that culture and era. Walking alone in a blue raincoat, and with ¬£1 in cash and a blue canvas bag, she was last seen by witnesses in secluded Stiups Lane. When Lesley failed to return home, her concerned mother sent her siblings out to look for her, and her step-father also joined the search. At 3:00 pm, with no sign of her, and no evidence that she had arrived at the shops, the Rochdale Police were contacted. A search around the town and the adjacent M62 area was immediately begun. Molseed's body was found three days later, around 8:00 am on 8 October, in a natural turf shelf 9 metres above a remote roadside layby on the trans-Pennine A672 near Rishworth Moor in West Yorkshire. Lying face down in some tall grass, she had been stabbed 12 times in the upper shoulder and back. Some of the wounds were very deep and one had penetrated her heart. There were no defensive wounds, and a time of death could not be calculated. None of her clothing or possessions were disturbed, but the money was missing and someone had ejaculated on her clothing and underwear. Other evidence collected by forensics included foreign fibres, traces of dry wallpaper paste, and 379 other objects in the vicinity. ==Prime suspect ‚Äì Kiszko== At the time of the hunt, four girls, Maxine Buckley aged 12, Catherine Burke aged 16, Debbie Brown aged 13 and Pamela Hind aged 18, all claimed that Kiszko had indecently exposed himself to them the day before the murder. One of them also said he had exposed himself to her a month after the murder, on Bonfire Night. Kiszko was then a 23-year-old local tax clerk of Eastern European (Latvian) descent. His father, Ivan (spelled Iwan and also called John), had emigrated from Soviet Ukraine and his mother, Charlotte (n√©e Slaviƒç), from Yugoslavia (modern-day Slovenia) after the Second World War to work in the cotton mills of Rochdale. West Yorkshire Police quickly formed the view that Kiszko fitted their profile of the sort of person likely to have killed Molseed even though he had never been in trouble with the law and had no social life beyond his mother and aunt. His father had died of a heart attack in the street, at Kiszko's feet, on 26 September 1970. Evaluation showed Kiszko had a mental and emotional age of just 12. Kiszko also had an unusual hobby of writing down registration numbers of cars that annoyed him, which supported police suspicions. The police now pursued evidence which might incriminate him, and ignored other leads that might have taken them in other directions. Acting upon the teenage girls' information and their suspicions of Kiszko's idiosyncratic lifestyle‚Äîand having allegedly found girlie magazines and a bag of sweets in his car‚Äîthe police arrested him on 21 December 1975. During questioning, the interviewing detectives seized upon every apparent inconsistency between his varying accounts of the relevant days as further demonstration of his likely guilt. Kiszko confessed to the crime after three days of intensive questioning: He believed that by doing so he would be allowed to go home and that the ensuing investigations would prove him innocent and his confession false. Prior to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act of 1984, suspects did not have the right to have a solicitor present during interviews and the police did not ask Kiszko if he wanted one. His request to have his mother present while he was being questioned was refused and, crucially, the police did not caution him until long after they had decided he was the prime ‚Äì indeed, the only ‚Äì suspect. After admitting to the murder to police, Kiszko was charged with Molseed's murder on Christmas Eve 1975. When he entered Armley Gaol after being charged, he was nicknamed \\"Oliver Laurel\\" because he had the girth of Oliver Hardy and the perplexed air of Oliver's comedy sidekick Stan Laurel. Later, in the presence of a solicitor, Kiszko retracted his confession. Kiszko was remanded until his murder trial, which began on 7 July 1976 under Sir Hugh Park at Leeds Crown Court (then at Leeds Town Hall). He was defended by David Waddington QC, who later became Home Secretary. The prosecuting QC, Peter Taylor, became Lord Chief Justice the day after Kiszko was cleared of the murder in 1992. ===Trial and appeal=== Kiszko was tried at Leeds Assizes then seated at Leeds Town Hall (courtroom pictured) Kiszko's defence team led by Waddington made significant mistakes. Firstly, they did not seek an adjournment when the Crown delivered thousands of pages of additional unused material on the first morning of the trial. Then there was the inconsistent defence of diminished responsibility which Kiszko never authorised, on the grounds that the testosterone he was receiving for his hypogonadism might have made him behave unusually. Kiszko's endocrinologist strongly disagreed with this theory, and if called to testify would have said that his treatment could not have caused him to act in such a way that would make him carry out a murder. He was never called. The manslaughter claim undermined Kiszko's claims that he was totally innocent and destroyed his alibis (a defence known in legal parlance as 'riding two horses'). In fact, his innocence could have been demonstrated at the trial. The pathologist who examined Molseed's clothes found traces of sperm, whereas the sample taken from Kiszko by the police contained no sperm. There was medical evidence that Kiszko had broken his ankle some months before the murder and, in view of that and his being overweight, he would have found it difficult to scale the slope to the murder spot. The sperm findings were suppressed by the police and never disclosed to the defence team or the jury; neither was the medical evidence of his broken ankle disclosed to the court. Kiszko gave evidence that in July 1975 he had become ill and had been admitted to Birch Hill Hospital, where he was given a blood transfusion. In August he was transferred to a Manchester hospital and diagnosed as being anaemic and as having a hormone deficiency.Rochdale Observer ‚Äì 14 November 2007 He agreed to injections to rectify the latter problem and was discharged in September 1975. He said correctly that he had never met Molseed and therefore could not have murdered her, and he claimed he was with his aunt tending to his father's grave in Halifax at the time of the murder before visiting a garden centre and then going home. When asked why he had confessed, Kiszko replied, \\"I started to tell these lies and they seemed to please them and the pressure was off as far as I was concerned. I thought if I admitted what I did to the police they would check out what I had said, find it untrue and would then let me go\\". His conviction was secured by a 10‚Äì2 majority verdict on 21 July 1976 at Leeds Crown Court after five hours and 35 minutes' deliberation. He was given a life sentence for committing Molseed's murder. The judge praised the three teenage girls who had made the exposure claims, Buckley in particular, for their \\"bravery and honesty\\" in giving evidence in court and their \\"sharp observations\\". The evidence of Pamela Hind, was read out in court. Park said that Buckley's \\"[s]harp eyes set this train of inquiry into motion\\". He also praised the police officers involved in the case \\"for their great skill in bringing to justice the person responsible for this dreadful crime and their expertise in sifting through masses of material\\", adding, \\"I would like all the officers responsible for the result to be specially commended and these observations conveyed to the Chief Constable\\". DS John Akeroyd and DSupt Holland were singled out for praise. Sheila Buckley, whose daughter Maxine played a major part in securing Kiszko's conviction, criticised the police for not arresting him earlier and told the Manchester Evening News that \\"... children are a lot safer now this monster has been put away\\".Manchester Evening News, 21 July 1976 She also demanded that Kiszko be hanged. Even Albert Wright, Kiszko's solicitor, thought that his client was guilty but that it was a case of diminished responsibility and that therefore he should not have been convicted outright of murder. After a month in Armley Prison, Kiszko was transferred to Wakefield Prison and immediately placed on Rule 43 to protect him from other inmates, as in the eyes of the law he was now a convicted sex offender. Kiszko launched an appeal, but it was dismissed on 25 May 1978, when Lord Justice Bridge said \\"We can find no grounds whatsoever to condemn the jury's verdict of murder as in any way unsafe or unsatisfactory. The appeal is dismissed\\". ==Time in prison== ===Attacks=== After his conviction Kiszko was fiercely and bitterly hated by the majority of inmates, receiving taunts and several verbal and written death threats during his first months in prison. He was physically attacked four times in total. The first time was on 24 August 1976, just after being transferred to Wakefield Prison, when he was set upon in his cell by five prisoners who stole his watch, smashed up his radio, cut his mouth and injured both his leg and ankle. The attackers said they did it for Lesley and her family.Delusions of Innocence: The Tragic Case of Stefan Kiszko - Page 22.The Innocents - How justice failed Kiszko and Lesley Molseed - page 205 On 11 May 1977 he was hit over the head with a mop handle, leaving Kiszko in need of three stitches to a head wound.The Innocents - How justice failed Kiszko and Lesley Molseed - page 209 In December 1978, he was punched once in the face by another prisoner in an unprovoked attack, whilst in the prison chapel.The Innocents - How justice failed Kiszko and Lesley Molseed - page 234 In March 1981 he was again punched in the face by a prisoner in an unprovoked attack, whilst in the prison yard, but this time Kiszko retaliated and fought back. Blows were exchanged and a fight broke out. The two had to be separated by guards. Both men were given a loss of privileges for 28 days. On each occasion, the attacks on Kiszko earned him absolutely no sympathy, from either other prisoners or guards, because of the crime for which he had been jailed. Kiszko was not physically attacked or threatened again during his remaining eleven years in prison. During much of that time he was in the hospital wing of prisons. When he was not, he was placed among less violent offenders. ===Mental illness=== In July 1979 the Inland Revenue finally wrote to Kiszko to inform him he had been sacked and from late 1979 onwards, Kiszko developed schizophrenia whilst in prison and began to suffer from delusions, one being that he was the victim of a plot to incarcerate an innocent tax-office employee so the effects of imprisonment would be tested on him. Over the next decade any of Kiszko's claims of innocence were labelled as symptoms of his schizophrenic delusions, or attributed to his being in a state of denial. One forensic psychiatrist made a note of Kiszko suffering from \\"delusions of innocence\\". In January 1980 he said that coded messages on BBC Radio Two's Jimmy Young Show were being sent to him. In 1982 he claimed that his parents had a tape recorder hidden in the kitchen and made him sing after turning it on, later selling the songs to Barry Manilow to make money out of his talent.Rose, Panter and Wilkinson, Innocents ‚Äì How justice failed Stefen Kiszko and Lesley Molseed, Fourth Estate, London, 1997, pp 240. ==Remaining years in prison== In October 1981 Kiszko was put on the punishment block for possessing scissors in his cell. On 11 November 1981, Kiszko was transferred to Gloucester Prison. In April 1983 he was told that he would only ever be eligible for parole if he admitted to having carried out the murder. If he continued to deny being a child killer, then he would spend the rest of his natural life behind bars, but this made no difference to Kiszko's stance. Thirteen months later, while still denying having carried out the murder, he was moved to Bristol Prison. Such was his mental deterioration that a month later, in June 1984, it was recommended by a forensic psychiatrist that he should be moved to either Broadmoor, Park Moss Side Hospital (later Ashworth Hospital, Liverpool) or Rampton, but nothing came of it. Six months later, in December 1984, Kiszko was returned to Wakefield Prison. In August 1987 he was transferred again from Wakefield to Grendon Underwood Prison, where, in June 1988, the prison governor tried to persuade Kiszko to enrol on a sex offenders' treatment programme, in which he would have had to admit having committed the murder of Molseed. Having done that, he would then have to discuss what motivated him to do it. Kiszko refused to take part and repeatedly and persistently refused to \\"address his offending behaviour\\" on the grounds that he had done nothing that needed addressing. He left in Grendon Underwood in May 1989, where he was classed as having \\"made no progress\\" and moved back to Wakefield Prison. In July 1990 he said he was striking out a ghost who was trying to sexually abuse him. Finally, on 15 March 1991, Kiszko was transferred to Ashworth Hospital, under Section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983, after six months of delay, on the grounds of his deteriorating mental health. ===Case reopened=== Kiszko's mother continued to profess her son's innocence, but was ignored and stonewalled both by politicians, including her local MP Cyril Smith and Prime Ministers James Callaghan (1976 to 1979) and Margaret Thatcher (from 1979 onwards), and by the legal system. In 1984 she contacted JUSTICE, the UK human rights organisation which at the time investigated many miscarriages of justice. Three years later, she was put in touch with solicitor Campbell Malone, who agreed to take a look at the case. Malone consulted Philip Clegg, who had been Waddington's junior at the July 1976 trial. Clegg had expressed his own doubts about the confession and conviction at the time, and over the next two years, Clegg and Malone prepared a petition to the Home Secretary. The draft was finally ready to be sent on 26 October 1989. On the same day, by coincidence, David Waddington was appointed Home Secretary. Sixteen months passed before a police investigation into the conduct of the original trial began. Waddington resigned as Home Secretary in November 1990 to take up a peerage and to serve as Leader of the House of Lords. He was replaced by Kenneth Baker. In February 1991 Campbell Malone, with the help of a private detective named Peter Jackson, finally urged the Home Office to reopen the case, which was then referred back to West Yorkshire Police. Detective Superintendent Trevor Wilkinson was assigned to the job. He immediately found several glaring errors. Kiszko's innocence was demonstrated conclusively through medical evidence; he had male hypogonadism, which rendered him infertile, contradicting forensic evidence obtained at the time of the murder. In 1975 his testes had measured 4 to 5 mm, whereas the average adult testicular size was 15 to 20 mm. During his research, Jackson found someone who confirmed that Kiszko had been seen with his aunt tending his father's grave on the day the murder took place. They said they could not understand why they had not been called to give evidence at the trial. Someone else said that Kiszko had been in a shop around the time of the murder. Also that month, the four girls, now aged 27, 28, 31 and 33, who were involved in the court trial admitted that the evidence they had given which had led to Kiszko's arrest and conviction was false, and that they had lied for \\"a laugh\\" and because \\"at the time it was funny\\". Burke was interviewed at Sowerby Police Station on 14 February 1991. She said she wished she had not said anything saying she did not think it would go as far as it did. Burke said she went along with what Hind said. Buckley said it was not Kiszko who had exposed himself to her, but she had seen a taxi driver (not Ronald Castree) urinating behind a bush on the day of Molseed's murder. She also refused to apologise. Brown refused to make any statement. Hind was a friend of Molseed's older sister but she was the most remorseful of the four, saying that what they did was \\"foolish but we were young\\" and that, had she appeared in court, she would have told the truth about Kiszko, unlike her three friends, who all had committed perjury. She herself did not think Kiszko would be convicted. A decision was made by the prosecuting authorities for a senior police officer to caution Pamela Hind and Catherine Burke for the criminal offence that each had undoubtedly committed.O'Connell, Michael. Delusions of Innocence: The Tragic Case of Stefan Kiszko . Waterside Press. ===Acquittal=== In February 1990, the Home Office privately disclosed that Kiszko's first parole hearing would take place in December 1992, by which time he would have served 17 years in custody. However, he would only be released if he admitted to having murdered Molseed and if he could convince the Parole Board that he would not be a danger to children or the public. In August 1991, the new findings in Kiszko's case were referred to Kenneth Baker, who immediately passed them on to the Court of Appeal. On 19 December 1991, Kiszko was moved from Ashworth to Prestwich Hospital. Ten months before his parole hearing, on 17 February 1992, the judicial investigation into Kiszko's conviction began. It was heard by three judges, Lord, Mr Justice Rose and Mr Justice Potts. Present at the hearing were Franz Muller QC and William Boyce for the Crown, who were there to argue that Kiszko was guilty of murder and therefore must remain in prison custody for at least another ten months, and Stephen Sedley QC and Jim Gregory, to state that Kiszko was innocent. After hearing the new evidence presented by Sedley and Gregory, Muller and Boyce did not put up any contrary argument and immediately accepted its validity. Also after hearing the new evidence, Lord Chief Justice Lane said: \\"It has been shown that this man cannot produce sperm. This man cannot have been the person responsible for ejaculating over the girl's knickers and skirt, and consequently cannot have been the murderer.\\" Kiszko was cleared and Lord Lane ordered his immediate release from custody. The 1976 trial judge Sir Hugh Park, who had praised the police and the 13-year-old girls at the original trial for bringing Kiszko to justice, apologised for what had happened to Kiszko but said he was not sorry for how he had handled the court case. Anthony Beaumont-Dark, a Conservative MP said \\"This must be the worst miscarriage of justice of all time. It brings shame on everyone involved in the case\\" and demanded a full, independent and wide-ranging inquiry into the conviction. The Molseed family, who were totally convinced of Kiszko's guilt up to the very moment of him being cleared, also publicly apologised for the things they had said after his conviction such as demanding that he be hanged in public. (Molseed's father, Frederick Anderson, had hurled a volley of angry verbal abuse at Kiszko's mother, Charlotte, outside the court after her son was convicted). Anderson had also told the media that he would be outside the prison gates waiting for Kiszko should he ever be released. Molseed's older sister Julie Crabbe said when Kiszko was cleared \\"How could anyone feel about this innocent man who has spent 16 years in prison and they were not very nice to him in prison. At least his mum knows that he will come home. Our Lesley will never come home again.\\"The Times - 19 February 1992 In February 1992, Kiszko's mother said that it was David Waddington who ought to be \\"strung up\\" for his pro-capital punishment views and for the way he had handled her son's defence at the 1976 trial. Lord Lane himself, Waddington, Sheila Buckley, Maxine Buckley, Hind, Brown and Burke, Ronald Outteridge and prosecution barrister Peter Taylor all offered no apology, nor did any of them express any words of remorse or regret for what had happened. Even the West Yorkshire police, while accepting and admitting they had been wrong, tried to justify the position they had taken in 1975. All Waddington would say was that if this evidence had been available in July 1976, the trial would have taken a very different course. Dick Holland the surviving senior officer in charge of the original investigation, said \\"Words can't express the regret I feel for the family and for Kiszko, now it has turned out he is innocent. But the enquiry was done diligently and honestly within the terms that were legally and scientifically available. After Kiszko's arrest, the forensic science service received a hanky which may have had seminal stainings from Kiszko. After his arrest, he produced a sample in the presence of his solicitor and doctor which was sent to the laboratory for comparison. Now how much further can you go?\\".The Times - 19 February 1992 On 2 March 1992 Dr Edward Tierney, who ordered the sperm tests that led to the freeing of Kiszko, was dismissed after 25 years because he had demanded that police surgeons should be independent of the police and Crown Prosecution Service.The Times - 3 March 1992 ==Release and death== Kiszko needed further psychiatric treatment and remained in Prestwich Hospital until late April 1992https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/sunshine-start-to- a-new-life-1010859 when he was finally released, but the 16 years of incarceration for something he had not done had both mentally and emotionally destroyed him. Kiszko became a virtual recluse and showed little interest in anything or anyone. He bought a new car, a silver Ford Sierra and drove it on short journeys to the shops, Morrison's or garden centres or to visit relativesThe Innocents - How Justice Failed Stefan Kiszko and Lesley Molseed, but other people's apologies for what had happened, encouragement and support seemed to frighten him. As his mental health had deteriorated over the years, so now did his physical health; in October 1993 he was diagnosed as suffering from angina. Stefan Kiszko died at 1am on 23 December 1993, after suffering a massive heart attack, at his home, 18 years and two days after he made the confession that helped lead to wrongful conviction for murder.https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/fate-cruelly- denied-stefan-a-happy-1010864 Molseed's sister was one of those who attended his funeral two weeks later on 5 January 1994. His mother, Charlotte Hedwig Kiszko, died four months later, at Birch Hill Hospital, Rochdale, on 3 May 1994, at the age of 70.https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local- news/fate-cruelly-denied-stefan-a-happy-1010864 The two are buried together in Rochdale Cemetery. After release from prison Kiszko had been told he would receive ¬£500,000 in compensation for the years spent in prison. He had received an interim payment, but neither he nor his mother ever received the full amount they were awarded, since both died before Kiszko was due to receive it. ===Police exonerated=== In 1994 the surviving senior officer in charge of the original investigation, Detective Superintendent Dick Holland, and the retired forensic scientist who had worked on the case, Ronald Outteridge, were formally charged with \\"doing acts tending to pervert the course of justice\\" by allegedly suppressing evidence in Kiszko's favour, namely the results of scientific tests on semen taken from the victim's body and from the accused. On May Day 1995 the case was challenged by defence barristers, arguing that the case was an abuse of process and that charges should be stayed as the passage of time had made a fair trial impossible. The presiding magistrate agreed and as the case was never presented before a jury, the law regards the accused as presumed innocent.Rose, Panter and Wilkinson, Innocents ‚Äì How justice failed Stefen Kiszko and Lesley Molseed, Fourth Estate, London, 1997, pp 337-338 Holland, who came to public prominence as a senior officer on the flawed investigation into the murders committed by the Yorkshire Ripper, retired in 1988, at a time when he viewed the conviction of both Kiszko and of Judith Ward (in May 1992 her conviction was also viewed as unsafe by the High Court) as being among his finest hours during his 35 years in the police force. However, Holland was demoted during the Yorkshire Ripper inquiry four years after Kiszko's conviction. He died in February 2007 at the age of 74. ==New suspect ‚Äì Ronald Castree== In 1985 with the case being closed and the public and the Police believing that Molseed's killer was safely behind bars, her clothes which were taken from the crime scene were destroyedhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/man-convicted- of-1975-murder-of-schoolgirl-400065.html but strips of adhesive tape had been kept which had been used to remove fibres from the inside and outside of Molseed's semen stained pants. Scientists from the Forensic Science Service's lab in Wetherby, West Yorkshire, managed to extract sperm heads from this tape. And from these sperm heads, in 1999, for the first ever time, a DNA profile of the man who killed Molseed and ejaculated into her pants was obtained. But he wasn't in the National DNA Database.Rochdale Observer - 14 November 2007 On 5 November 2006, it was announced that a 53-year-old man had been arrested in connection with the murder of Molseed that had taken place in 1975. DNA evidence was alleged to have shown a \\"direct hit\\" with a sample found at the scene of the murder. Ronald Castree (born 18 October 1953 in Littleborough, near Rochdale), a comic book dealer, of Shaw and Crompton was charged with murder and made his first court appearance on 7 November 2006 where he was remanded in custody. At a court hearing on 19 April 2007, Castree pleaded not guilty. On 23 April 2007 he was refused bail. A DNA sample from Castree, taken on 1 October 2005 when he was arrested but not charged in connection with another sex attack, was a direct match with a semen sample found on her underwear, when run through the National DNA Datababse. Originally from the Turf Hill estate of Rochdale, Castree lived in nearby Shaw and Crompton and was a taxi driver for many years. He was unpopular with his neighbours, who said he had a very nasty temper. His former wife said \\"he was foul with his mouth, and foul with his fists\\". Two weeks before Castree killed Molseed, his wife had given birth to a son. Castree was not the baby's biological father; his wife had had an affair in late 1974. On 3 October 1975 Castree's wife went back into hospital with deep vein thrombosis, leaving Castree home alone on the day of the murder. She remained there for the following week. The birth of the illegitimate child may have been a trigger for Castree's murder of Molseed. Castree and his wife had two more children together, but they split up in 1996 and divorced a year later. On 3 July 1976 Castree abducted and sexually assaulted a nine-year-old girl. https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester- news/girl-9-escaped-after-attack-1008334On 12 July he pleaded guiltyhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/miscarriage-of-justice- corrected-as-jury-finds-man-guilty-of-murder-400089.html and was fined ¬£25 on both counts against him which were indecent assault and incitement to commit an act of gross indecency.Delusions of Innocence: The Tragic Case of Stefan Kiszko - Page 22. On 17 July 1978 Castree was fined ¬£50 after indecently assaulting a seven year old boy.Delusions of Innocence: The Tragic Case of Stefan Kiszko - Page 26. ==Trial and conviction== During the trial a scientist told a jury how DNA taken from the underwear of Molseed was linked to the man accused of her murder. Dr Gemma Escott explained to Bradford Crown Court the chances of the semen samples belonging to anyone other than the defendant were one in a billion. Castree's trial began at Bradford Crown Court on 22 October 2007. He was found guilty on 12 November 2007 and jailed for life, with a recommendation to serve a minimum of 30 years, which is expected to keep him in prison until November 2036 and the age of 83. == Media == A TV film adaptation of Kiszko's story was made and shown in October 1998, A Life for a Life, directed by Stephen Whittaker, featuring Tony Maudsley as Kiszko and Olympia Dukakis as his mother Charlotte. A documentary about the case, Real Crime: The 30 Year Secret, was broadcast by ITV1 on 29 September 2008. In the Channel 4 television series Red Riding, the character of Michael Myshkin is based on Kiszko, being a simple-minded immigrant who is coerced into confessing the rape and murder of an 11-year-old girl before eventually being exonerated. The satirical animated series Monkey Dust featured Ivan Dobsky, a character similar to Kiszko, being a simple-minded East European convicted of murder after being tortured by police. In February 2003, a television appeal for new information was made by Detective Chief Superintendent Max McLean of West Yorkshire Police on the BBC Crimewatch programme, publicly announcing the existence of a DNA profile of the killer for the first time, but no new leads were forthcoming. As revealed in the ITV television documentary Real Crime: The 30 Year Secret, Castree was convicted in 1976 of gross indecency and indecent assault against a nine-year-old girl in Rochdale. He was fined ¬£25 (). In May 2018, the crime and the convictions were covered in a 2-part series by Casefile True Crime Podcast. == See also == *List of miscarriage of justice cases *Murder of Teresa de Simone *Murder of Linda Cook *Murder of Wendy Sewell *Murder of Carol Wilkinson *Murder of Jacqueline Thomas *Innocent prisoner's dilemma ==ReferencesCategory:1975 in England Category:1975 murders in the United Kingdom Category:1970s trials Category:2000s trials Category:Crime in West Yorkshire Category:Deaths by stabbing in England Category:Female murder victims Category:Murder in Greater Manchester Category:Murder trials Category:October 1975 crimes Category:October 1975 events in the United Kingdom Category:Trials in England Category:English criminal law Category:Legal history of England Category:Overturned convictions in the United Kingdom ","title":"Murder of Lesley Molseed"},{"id":"1436969","text":"Yuki Hsu (born 3 March 1978) is a Taiwanese singer and actress from Taiwan. She is perhaps best known for her series of hits in Taiwan between 1998 and 2001. Most of her songs in her early career are upbeat, catchy, melodic dance tracks, often with youthful themes or lyrics. Some of her well-known songs include \\"Ding Dong\\" (a cover of Danish singer Tiggy's hit \\"Ring A Ling\\"), \\"Who's Naughty\\" (a cover of Dr Bombay's \\"Calcutta (Taxi Taxi Taxi)\\"), and a remake of the '90s techno track \\"Dub-i-Dub\\". In 1999 she collaborated with South Korean rapper Yoo Seung Jun on the duet \\"Can't Wait\\". She is also noted for the flamboyant and outlandish hairdos she sported in many of her early music videos. In 2001, Hsu temporarily ceased her singing career and turned to acting. In 2007, she returned to the music scene with the album Bad Girl. On 25 May 2018, Yuki Hsu held the concert, Only for Meeting You (Âè™ÁÇ∫„ÄåÈà∫„ÄçË¶ã‰Ω†), at Taipei International Convention Center, celebrating her 20 years of singing career. ==Personal life== Hsu faded into obscurity in the aftermath of a legal quagmire involving contract breaches and negative press covers. The court charged her with NT$2 million in damages and legal fines, and her mother borrowed money to help them get by. In 2010, she took on a job as an unpaid paralegal assistant so that she can study legal matters to prepare herself for her legal challenges. In 2011 Hsu claims that her former manager, Wu Zu Wang, of Dragon Imperium International Film Production Corp, texted inappropriate messages to her. She states that she has a backlog of such messages. Hsu was sued for a breach of contract when she failed to show up for a concert and made unauthorized public appearances on Taiwanese broadcasts. ==Discography== ===Singles=== * (1998.01) \\"Flying\\" (È£õËµ∑‰æÜ) * (1998.08) \\"5.6.7.8.

He played for Home United from 2004 to 2012, having played for Geylang United and the Young Lions in his earlier years. Lewis made his international debut in 2002 and made 73 appearances for the Singapore national football team. He was named the 2004 Tiger Cup MVP, and was nominated for the 2006 Asian Footballer of the Year award. After his retirement from professional football he has worked for Nanyang Polytechnic managing student sports. ==Club career== Lewis first played for Geylang United, and is recognised as one of an outstanding trio of keepers ‚Äì the other two being Shahril Jantan and Hassan Sunny ‚Äî that have turned out for the club. After a brief career at Geylang, where he made a total of 60 appearances, he joined the Young Lions to become part of the first Young Lions side to play in the S.League in 2003. In August 2004, the police regular joined Home United (which is affiliated to the Singapore Police Force) on a short-term contract and played for the Protectors in their AFC Cup campaign, before returning to the Young Lions. He made a return to Home United in 2005, where he has remained until the end of his career. Lewis has been cited as the difference between Home United and the other teams. Balestier Khalsa coach, Abdul Karim Razzak, described him as \\"a goalkeeper that can win 20 points for his team in a season\\". As of 21 December, he trained with Premier League club Manchester City. One week later, on 28 December 2007, Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson decided not to sign Lewis. On 13 January 2008, he underwent a one-week trial at Swiss Super League club Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich. On 22 January, he confirmed with S-League that he would not be signing a contract with Grasshopper. Lionel retired from professional football at the end of 2012 season, at the age of 29. ==International career== A teenage Lionel Lewis was touted by former Singapore coach Vincent Subramaniam as a future international, and the lanky keeper fulfilled those expectations with his progression into the senior squad. Lewis, who has a huge following, made his senior debut for the Singapore national team in a 2‚Äì0 friendly win over the Maldives on 9 April 2002. However, he only managed to grab the \\"No. 18\\" jersey from fellow keeper Hassan Sunny in 2004 and since then, he has regularly kept goal for the country in international tournaments. He represented the Singapore national team in the Tiger Cup, South-east Asia's premier football tournament. He made his name in Tiger Cup 2004, when his impeccable performances between the sticks helped Singapore to a memorable triumph. He was subsequently named the tournament's MVP for his performance during the Cup. Lewis has played in three SEA Games, in 2001, 2003 and 2005. Lewis was nominated for the prestigious 2006 Asian Footballer of the Year award, making him the only ASEAN player and only goalkeeper among the nominees and the first Singapore nominee in the award's history. While playing for Singapore in the 2006 King's Cup against Thailand, he was knocked unconscious after a horrific clash with Thai forward, Kiatisuk Senamuang. A post-match medical report indicated that the injury was not serious. ==Personal life== A graduate of Nanyang Polytechnic, Lewis later studied at Novation Business School in 2005. He graduated with an advanced diploma certificate in Sports and Leisure Management. In 2008, Lewis completed his degree in Sports Management from University of Wolverhampton. Lewis currently works at the Nanyang Polytechnic Student Affair Office. Lewis is married to Jenny Lam, a former flight stewardess. Together they have a daughter named Jennel Larissa and a son named Jonas Leroy. Appearing as one of the guest celebrity on the advertisement for Suzuki cup, he was portrayed as the pride of Asia as he is the first Singaporean to train with Premiership club's Manchester City first team. ==Endorsements== In 2010, Lionel signed a contract with Puma, after previously being sponsored by Adidas. Lionel's partnership with YEO‚ÄôS blossomed over the years and soon he became the ambassador of H-TWO-O and has been actively involved in their advertising campaigns. He is the first S.League player to be featured in a TV commercial which was produced outside of Singapore. Lionel is also one of the brand ambassadors of Europe's leading sports nutrition company, Maximuscle, here in Singapore. ==Honours== ===Club=== ;Geylang United *S.League: 2001 ;Home United *Singapore Cup: 2005, 2011 ===International=== ;Singapore *ASEAN Football Championship: 2004, 2007 ===Individual=== *Tiger Cup MVP: 2004 ==References== #Sven Goran Eriksson has a Singapore goalkeeper currently training with his squad #Lionel training with Man City # # #https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMy5aco4SV8 ==External links== *Player profile: ** ** ** ** *RedSports interview with Lionel Lewis Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Singaporean footballers Category:Geylang International FC players Category:Singapore Premier League players Category:Singaporean police officers Category:Singapore international footballers Category:Home United FC players Category:Nanyang Polytechnic alumni Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Young Lions FC players Category:Footballers at the 2006 Asian Games Category:Asian Games competitors for Singapore Category:Singaporean people of English descent ","title":"Lionel Lewis"},{"id":"1436986","text":"Gustav Anders Hemwall (October 24, 1908 - November 22, 1998) was a physician at West Suburban Hospital in Oak Park, Illinois and pioneer in prolotherapy. ==Biography== He was born on October 24, 1908 in Chicago, Illinois to the Swedish immigrants Anders Hemwall I (1877‚Äì1956) and Sigrid S.

The name \\"Arden Heights\\" is found on most maps of New York City, including Hagstrom's. Arden Heights is bordered by Annadale to the east, Huguenot to the south, the Arthur Kill to the west, and the Fresh Kills to the north. ==History== Erastus Wiman, a noted Staten Island real estate developer, coined the name \\"Arden Heights\\" in 1886; the neighborhood's name probably refers to the hill that currently looms above the Village Greens shopping center and housing development. (The moniker does not refer to the now-shuttered Fresh Kills Landfill, at the western end of Arden Avenue. The landfill did not exist until the mid-20th Century.) Long noted for being the site of St. Michael's Home For Children, a Roman Catholic orphanage, Arden Heights underwent a serious transformation when the aforementioned Village Greens, New York City's first planned urban development, opened there in 1971. Ground was broken for the project by Mayor John V. Lindsay, who in the late 1960s proudly announced that travel time from the Greens to Lower Manhattan would average one hour 15 minutes ‚Äì just about the same when taking a bus in 2007. In 1982, the Saint Michael's orphanage, situated off Arthur Kill Road, closed, with some land on which it stood being sold to developers (who have since built the Aspen Knolls development) and the remainder set aside for use as a church, named for the recently canonized St. John Neumann. The church also maintains a convent for the Presentation Sisters on the east side of the property; in 2005 a section of this land was sold off, with new home construction to follow here too ‚Äî still another sign of the continuing housing boom on Staten Island, which has gone on virtually uninterrupted since the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened in 1964. ==Village Greens== The Greens feature clustered townhomes built around looped streets ‚Äì one way in, one way out. Off the main thoroughfares of Arden Avenue and Arthur Kill Road, these streets ‚Äì Hampton Green, Forest Green, Dover Green, Avon Green, and Carlyle Green ‚Äì provides a relatively traffic- free environment, making Village Greens a unique place to live in an otherwise overdeveloped Staten Island. (Some Greens feature detached homes, which naturally fetch a higher market price than the townhomes, which are often clustered eight apiece.) Architectural guidelines and exterior home inspections by the Village Greens Homeowners Association have helped the community maintain its appearance. Another \\"Green\\" ‚Äì namely Rolling Hill Green ‚Äì was built on land intended for the Village Greens but, for reasons unknown (some conjecture that the developers ran out of cash and construction workers) were never built. These \\"Greens\\" have their own recreational facilities. A shopping center was simultaneously developed to serve the residents of Village Greens, as well as a New York City public elementary school; Village Greens also features a common park, featuring expanses of green grass, trees and ‚Äì most astonishingly ‚Äì two Olympic-sized swimming pools; all maintained through Village Greens Homeowners Association's relatively low common charges. Today, the project stands at the center of a community bearing its own identity, separate from that of Annadale. A large percentage of the residents of the development ‚Äî and the many single-family homes that have since been built around it ‚Äî are Jewish and Italian, giving Arden Heights more common ground with such Mid-Island neighborhoods as Willowbrook than with Annadale and other South Shore communities. The area also has a small Asian & Hispanic population that is more similar to Mid-Island neighborhoods than other South Shore neighborhoods. About a mile north of the \\"Greens\\" is the Aspen Knolls development, located off Arthur Kill Road, next to the St. John Neumann Church. Plans for this development began in the early 1990s and were originally meant for housing of Navy families. However, due to Base Realignment and Closure, the housing contract was terminated in November 1994 after the closure of the Staten Island Homeport in Stapleton. With the development already planned, the developer opted to market the one, two, and three bedroom homes to the public. Construction began in 1995 and was finished in early 2006. During this time period, people moved into the community as each house was finished being built. The complex includes playing fields and a community center. ==Transportation== Arden Heights is served by the local buses along Arthur Kill Road, the along Arden Avenue and Arthur Kill Road, and the along Annadale Road. It is also served by express buses to Manhattan, including the along Arden Avenue and Arthur Kill Road, the along Arthur Kill Road, and the along Woodrow Road and Arthur Kill Road. Arden Heights does not have a station on the Staten Island Railway, but it can be reached at the Annadale station via the S55 bus. ==Education== Arden Heights is served by the I.S.75 intermediate school. www.IS75.org ==Public libraries== New York Public Library operates the Huguenot Park Branch, which serves Arden Heights and other neighborhoods, at 830 Huguenot Avenue at Drumgoole Road East. The branch opened in January 1985.\\"Huguenot Park Branch.\\" New York Public Library.

He began attending the editorial meetings of A. R. Orage.\\"And after the war, Edwin Muir, Herbert Read, Michael Arlen, Denis Saurat, Janko Lavrin, and Philip Mairet, to mention a few, attended regularly.\\" (PDF), p. 43. Orage was a follower of Gurdjieff. Orage died suddenly in 1934, leaving the New English Weekly in limbo. Mairet, then the literary editor, emerged as the editor by a complex route: one group of Social Credit advocates wanted to exclude another group, of supporters of Mitrinoviƒá. Mairet was identified more with a third faction, the Chandos Group, around Maurice Reckitt, with Travers Symons, V. A. Demant, and Alan Porter.Jason Harding, The Criterion: Cultural Politics and Periodical Networks in Inter-War Britain (2002), pp. 191-2. This overlapped the Mitrinoviƒá group: there had been a shared interest in the journal Purpose, from 1929, and the theories of Adler were also a common factor.Mathew Thomson, Psychological Subjects: Identity, Culture, and Health in Twentieth-century Britain (2006), p. 91. Symons introduced Mairet to T. S. Eliot, who was holding the ring. In practical terms the Chandos Group were already deeply involved in producing the New English Weekly, and were sympathetic to Social Credit.Peter Barberis, John McHugh, and Mike Tyldesley, Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations (2000), p. 80. He belonged to numerous other small societies and discussion groups of the period before World War II.These included Oldham's Moot: Marjorie Reeves (editor), Christian Thinking and Social Order: Conviction Politics from the 1930s to the Present Day (1999), p, 25. He joined Rolf Gardiner's Kinship in Husbandry group in 1941.Julie V. Gottlieb, Thomas P. Linehan, The Culture of Fascism: Visions of the Far Right in Britain (2004), p. 187. He edited The Frontier for Walter Moberly's Christian Frontier Council.(PDF) , p. 21. He was an early supporter of George Orwell, giving him literary work for the New English Weekly, and writing in very positive and comprehending terms about Homage to Catalonia and Orwell's approach. He was a friend and long-time correspondent of T. S. Eliot, who dedicated his Notes towards the Definition of Culture to Mairet.Alzina Stone Dale, T. S. Eliot: The Philosopher Poet (2004), p. 170.

(A) No disturbing force (B) With an electric field, E (C) With an independent force, F (e.g. gravity) (D) In an inhomogeneous magnetic field, grad H In physics, the motion of an electrically charged particle such as an electron or ion in a plasma in a magnetic field can be treated as the superposition of a relatively fast circular motion around a point called the guiding center and a relatively slow drift of this point. The drift speeds may differ for various species depending on their charge states, masses, or temperatures, possibly resulting in electric currents or chemical separation. == Gyration == If the magnetic field is uniform and all other forces are absent, then the Lorentz force will cause a particle to undergo a constant acceleration perpendicular to both the particle velocity and the magnetic field. This does not affect particle motion parallel to the magnetic field, but results in circular motion at constant speed in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field. This circular motion is known as the gyromotion. For a particle with mass m and charge q moving in a magnetic field with strength B, it has a frequency, called the gyrofrequency or cyclotron frequency, of :\\\\omega_{\\\\rm c} = \\\\frac{qB}{m} . \\\\,\\\\\\\\! For a speed perpendicular to the magnetic field of v_{\\\\perp}, the radius of the orbit, called the gyroradius or Larmor radius, is :\\\\rho_{\\\\rm L} =\\\\frac{ v_{\\\\perp}}{ \\\\omega_{\\\\rm c}} . \\\\,\\\\\\\\! == Parallel motion == Since the magnetic Lorentz force is always perpendicular to the magnetic field, it has no influence (to lowest order) on the parallel motion. In a uniform field with no additional forces, a charged particle will gyrate around the magnetic field according to the perpendicular component of its velocity and drift parallel to the field according to its initial parallel velocity, resulting in a helical orbit. If there is a force with a parallel component, the particle and its guiding center will be correspondingly accelerated. If the field has a parallel gradient, a particle with a finite Larmor radius will also experience a force in the direction away from the larger magnetic field. This effect is known as the magnetic mirror. While it is closely related to guiding center drifts in its physics and mathematics, it is nevertheless considered to be distinct from them. == General force drifts == Generally speaking, when there is a force on the particles perpendicular to the magnetic field, then they drift in a direction perpendicular to both the force and the field. If \\\\vec{F} is the force on one particle, then the drift velocity is :\\\\vec{v}_f = \\\\frac{1}{q} \\\\frac{\\\\vec{F}\\\\times\\\\vec{B}}{B^2}. These drifts, in contrast to the mirror effect and the non-uniform B drifts, do not depend on finite Larmor radius, but are also present in cold plasmas. This may seem counterintuitive. If a particle is stationary when a force is turned on, where does the motion perpendicular to the force come from and why doesn't the force produce a motion parallel to itself? The answer is the interaction with the magnetic field. The force initially results in an acceleration parallel to itself, but the magnetic field deflects the resulting motion in the drift direction. Once the particle is moving in the drift direction, the magnetic field deflects it back against the external force, so that the average acceleration in the direction of the force is zero. There is, however, a one-time displacement in the direction of the force equal to (f/m)œâc‚àí2, which should be considered a consequence of the polarization drift (see below) while the force is being turned on. The resulting motion is a cycloid. More generally, the superposition of a gyration and a uniform perpendicular drift is a trochoid. All drifts may be considered special cases of the force drift, although this is not always the most useful way to think about them. The obvious cases are electric and gravitational forces. The grad-B drift can be considered to result from the force on a magnetic dipole in a field gradient. The curvature, inertia, and polarisation drifts result from treating the acceleration of the particle as fictitious forces. The diamagnetic drift can be derived from the force due to a pressure gradient. Finally, other forces such as radiation pressure and collisions also result in drifts. === Gravitational field === A simple example of a force drift is a plasma in a gravitational field, e.g. the ionosphere. The drift velocity is :\\\\vec{v}_g = \\\\frac{m}{q} \\\\frac{\\\\vec{g}\\\\times\\\\vec{B}}{B^2} Because of the mass dependence, the gravitational drift for the electrons can normally be ignored. The dependence on the charge of the particle implies that the drift direction is opposite for ions as for electrons, resulting in a current. In a fluid picture, it is this current crossed with the magnetic field that provides that force counteracting the applied force. === Electric field === This drift, often called the \\\\vec{E}\\\\times\\\\vec{B} (E-cross-B) drift, is a special case because the electric force on a particle depends on its charge (as opposed, for example, to the gravitational force considered above). As a result, ions (of whatever mass and charge) and electrons both move in the same direction at the same speed, so there is no net current (assuming quasineutrality of the plasma). In the context of special relativity, in the frame moving with this velocity, the electric field vanishes. The value of the drift velocity is given by :\\\\vec{v}_E = \\\\frac{\\\\vec{E}\\\\times\\\\vec{B}}{B^2} === Nonuniform E === If the electric field is not uniform, the above formula is modified to read :\\\\vec{v}_E = \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\rho_{\\\\rm L}^2 abla^2 \\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\vec{E}\\\\times\\\\vec{B}}{B^2} == Nonuniform B == Guiding center drifts may also result not only from external forces but also from non-uniformities in the magnetic field. It is convenient to express these drifts in terms of the parallel and perpendicular kinetic energies :K_\\\\ = \\\\frac{1}{2}mv_\\\\^2 :K_\\\\perp = \\\\frac{1}{2}mv_\\\\perp^2 In that case, the explicit mass dependence is eliminated. If the ions and electrons have similar temperatures, then they also have similar, though oppositely directed, drift velocities. === Grad-B drift === When a particle moves into a larger magnetic field, the curvature of its orbit becomes tighter, transforming the otherwise circular orbit into a cycloid. The drift velocity is :\\\\vec{v}_{ abla B} = \\\\frac{K_\\\\perp}{qB} \\\\frac{\\\\vec{B}\\\\times abla B}{B^{2}} === Curvature drift === In order for a charged particle to follow a curved field line, it needs a drift velocity out of the plane of curvature to provide the necessary centripetal force. This velocity is :\\\\vec{v}_{R }= \\\\frac{2K_\\\\}{qB}\\\\frac{\\\\vec{R}_{c}\\\\times\\\\vec{B}}{R_{c}^{2} B} where \\\\vec{R}_{c} is the radius of curvature pointing outwards, away from the center of the circular arc which best approximates the curve at that point. :\\\\vec{v}_{\\\\rm inertial} = \\\\frac{v_\\\\}{\\\\omega_c}\\\\, \\\\vec{b}\\\\times\\\\frac{d\\\\vec{b}}{dt}, where \\\\vec{b}=\\\\vec{B}/B is the unit vector in the direction of the magnetic field. This drift can be decomposed into the sum of the curvature drift and the term :\\\\frac{v_\\\\}{\\\\omega_c}\\\\, \\\\vec{b}\\\\times\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec{b}}{\\\\partial t} + (\\\\vec{v}_E\\\\cdot abla\\\\vec{b}) \\\\right]. In the important limit of stationary magnetic field and weak electric field, the inertial drift is dominated by the curvature drift term. === Curved vacuum drift === In the limit of small plasma pressure, Maxwell's equations provide a relationship between gradient and curvature that allows the corresponding drifts to be combined as follows :\\\\vec{v}_R + \\\\vec{v}_{ abla B} = \\\\frac{2K_\\\\+K_\\\\perp}{qB}\\\\frac{\\\\vec{R}_c\\\\times\\\\vec{B}}{R_c^2 B} For a species in thermal equilibrium, 2K_\\\\+K_\\\\perp can be replaced by 2k_BT (k_BT/2 for K_\\\\ and k_BT for K_\\\\perp). The expression for the grad-B drift above can be rewritten for the case when abla B is due to the curvature. This is most easily done by realizing that in a vacuum, Ampere's Law is abla\\\\times\\\\vec{B} = 0 . In cylindrical coordinates chosen such that the azimuthal direction is parallel to the magnetic field and the radial direction is parallel to the gradient of the field, this becomes : abla\\\\times\\\\vec{B} = \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r} \\\\left( r B_\\\\theta \\\\right) \\\\hat{z} = 0 Since r B_\\\\theta is a constant, this implies that : abla B = - B \\\\frac{\\\\vec{R}_c}{R_c^2} and the grad-B drift velocity can be written :\\\\vec{v}_{ abla B} = -\\\\frac{K_\\\\perp}{q} \\\\frac{\\\\vec{B}\\\\times \\\\vec{R}_c}{R_c^2 B^2} == Polarization drift == A time-varying electric field also results in a drift given by :\\\\vec{v}_p = \\\\frac{m}{qB^2}\\\\frac{d\\\\vec{E}}{dt} Obviously this drift is different from the others in that it cannot continue indefinitely. Normally an oscillatory electric field results in a polarization drift oscillating 90 degrees out of phase. Because of the mass dependence, this effect is also called the inertia drift. Normally the polarization drift can be neglected for electrons because of their relatively small mass. == Diamagnetic drift == The diamagnetic drift is not actually a guiding center drift. A pressure gradient does not cause any single particle to drift. Nevertheless, the fluid velocity is defined by counting the particles moving through a reference area, and a pressure gradient results in more particles in one direction than in the other. The net velocity of the fluid is given by :\\\\vec{v}_D = -\\\\frac{ abla p\\\\times\\\\vec{B}}{qn B^2} == Drift Currents == With the important exception of the E-cross-B drift, the drift velocities of differently charged particles will be different. This difference in velocities results in a current, while the mass dependence of the drift velocity can result in chemical separation. ==See also== *List of plasma (physics) articles ==References== T.G.

Her parents were David (a pharmacist) and Mary Ann (born Hunt) Partridge. She was educated locally and in 1899 she qualified to teach piano at the Royal Academy of Music. She then took up work as a governess, first in London and later in Bonn, Germany. ==Introduction to textiles== The Norman Chapel House main entrance in Broad Campden in 1895. This (partly 12th century) house was renovated by C. R. Ashbee for Ananda Coomaraswamy from 1905 to 1907 She met the famed art historian and philosopher Ananda Coomaraswamy. The couple married on 19 June 1902 and travelled to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where he conducted a mineral survey. The couple recorded the arts and crafts of each village, and Mairet kept meticulous journals, photographing each craft she observed. They returned to England in 1907 and published their investigations into Ceylon crafts. Until 1910 they lived in Broad Campden where the arts and crafts architect Charles Robert Ashbee had established a community of artists and craftspeople. This Guild and School of Handicraft in Chipping Campden included Ethel's brother Frederick James Partridge, a jeweller. Ashbee renovated a Norman chapel as the Coomaraswamy home. The couple visited India, where they added to the textile collection they had begun whilst in Ceylon. ==Weaving and dyeing== Aside from some rudimentary lessons in Ceylon and the British Isles, Ethel Mairet was self-taught as a weaver, spinner and dyer. Mairet made her first experiments with weaving and dyeing in 1909 in Chipping Camden. She studied vegetable dyes in the Bodleian Library, Oxford and is said to have travelled to the Lake District to learn weaving during this period. Her knowledge of dyes and mordants were likely compounded by her father (a chemist) and her husband Ananda Coomaraswamy (a botanist). Over the winter of 1910 Mairet and Coomaraswamy travelled to India. She wrote to the Ashbees over this period, and kept a journal detailing her discoveries of rare textiles and decorative jewellery, noting the vegetable dyes used. In 1910 Coomaraswamy began openly having an affair and their marriage ended. Ethel then built a house near Barnstaple complete with studios for textile dyeing and weaving. In 1913 she married Philip Mairet and together they established The Thatched House a joint home and studio near Stratford upon Avon. The studio provided a base for her first weaving workshop. The following year she was visited by Mahatma Gandhi, who knew of her work in Ceylon and was interested in using simple textile techniques in India (see Khadi). In 1916 she published A Book on Vegetable Dyes printed by Hilary Pepler at the Hampshire House Press in Hammersmith, London. ==Ditchling== Ditchling Museum of Art and Craft In 1916 she visited Hilary Pepler in Ditchling. Mairet was so impressed that she set about moving there. In 1917 she completed An Essay on Crafts and Obedience and oversaw the production of the second edition of A Book on Vegetable Dyes, both published by Hilary Pepler at St Dominic's Press in Ditchling. Gospels, Mairet's third and final building project was completed in late 1920. During the 1930s and 1940s she trained people in weaving and dyeing at her Ditchling studio. Mairet's seminal training at her workshop is said to have influenced all of the aspiring hand weavers of that generation including Hilary Bourne, Valentine KilBride, Elizabeth Peacock, Petra Gill and Peter Collingwood. The Swiss weaver Marianne Straub came to work with her and to learn more about hand loom weaving; Mairet taught Straub about hand dyeing and spinning as well. Straub introduced a variety of double cloth weaves and developed a friendship with Mairet. Mairet learnt in turn from Straub and this underwrote her belief that hand loom weaving could be used by industry. Straub and Mairet went on three European holidays during the mid 1930s. Straub frequently returned to Mairet and Gospels. A surviving journal written by Mairet from a European journey with her husband in 1927 illustrates how her observations were dominated not by whom she met but what they were wearing. In 1921 Bernard Leach and Shoji Hamada visited Mairet at Gospels. A member of both the Red Rose Guild of Craftsmen and the Guild of Weavers, Spinners and Dyers, in 1937 she became the first woman awarded the Royal Society of Arts title of Royal Designer for Industry. In 1939 she published Handweaving Today, Traditions and Change. She taught at the Brighton College of Art from 1939 until 1947. Mairet remained active throughout her life, and continued mentoring pupils and sending examples of her oeuvre to schools across the country. ==Legacy== Mairet died in Ditchling Common in 1952 and she was buried in Brighton, at St Nicholas' churchyard. Mairet influenced a generation of weavers. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography quotes the Japanese potter Shoji Hamada who called Mairet \\"the mother of English hand-weaving\\". Ditchling Museum of Art + Craft exhibits artifacts related to Mairet and other artists who worked locally. She is the subject of a biography, A Weaver's Life: Ethel Mairet. The Ethel Mairet archive is housed at the Crafts Study Centre. It includes documents and memorabilia from 1872‚Äì1952. Personal documents, travel journals 1910‚Äì1938. business and personal letters, books of account and photographs are included and are still a subject of academic study. ==Published works== * * ==ReferencesCategory:1872 births Category:1952 deaths Category:People from Barnstaple Category:British weavers Category:20th- century women textile artists Category:20th-century textile artists Category:20th-century British women artists Category:Alumni of the Royal Academy of Music ","title":"Ethel Mairet"},{"id":"1437031","text":"Dame Elizabeth Leah Manning DBE (n√©e Perrett; 14 April 1886 ‚Äì 15 September 1977) was a British educationalist, social reformer, and Labour Member of Parliament (MP) in the 1930s and 1940s. She organised the evacuation of orphaned or at risk Basque children during the Spanish Civil War.Basque Children of '37 Association, basquechildren.org; accessed 2 April 2014.

She became a teacher in Cambridge where she had met fellow undergraduate Hugh Dalton and joined the Fabian Society and the Independent Labour Party. Her school was in a poor area of the city and she pressed the city authorities to improve the health by providing free milk, using her position on Cambridge Trades Council to raise the issue. ==Marriage== She married William Henry Manning (1883‚Äì1952), an astronomer working for the University Solar Physics Laboratory, in 1914. They set up home together in a house on the Cambridge Observatory site.Ron Bill and Stan Newens Leah Manning Leah Manning Trust in association with Square One Books Limited, 1991; , pp. 21, 24, 45 He was a pacifist and a Liberal in politics. ==Politics== Spanish Medical Aid armband Mrs. Leah Manning Square, Bilbao, Spain. Manning welcomed news of the October revolution in Russia, and became a member of the 1917 Club. In peacetime, she became an active speaker on behalf of Labour candidates in elections around the country. She was appointed headmistress of a new experimental Open Air School for undernourished children which Cambridge education authority had established on a farm site, and found this work exceptionally rewarding. In 1929, she served as organising secretary of the National Union of Teachers, becoming its President in 1930. In 1931, she was elected as MP for Islington East in a by-election on 19 February. She did not support Ramsay MacDonald's National Government and stayed in the Labour Party, losing her seat a few months later at the 1931 general election in October. She served on the Labour Party National Executive Committee from 1931 to 1932, and in the 1935 general election unsuccessfully contested Sunderland. She was meanwhile moving away from her previous strict pacifism towards a more active anti-fascism. At the 1936 Labour Party Conference, several party members, including Ellen Wilkinson, Stafford Cripps, Aneurin Bevan and Charles Trevelyan, argued that military help should be given to the Popular Front of Spain, which fought Francisco Franco and his fascist Nationalist Army. Despite a passionate appeal from Isabel de Palencia, the Labour Party supported the Conservative Government's policy of non- intervention. Manning disagreed with the official line and became Secretary of the Spanish Medical Aid Committee. In the spring of 1937, she helped to arrange the evacuation of almost 4,000 Basque children to Britain as well as around 200 adults, accompanying the children on the SS Habana.Leah Manning, \\"The Cave By The River\\" and \\"Basque Children For England\\" in Jim Fyrth and Sally Alexander, Women's Voices from the Spanish Civil War. London : Lawrence & Wishart, 1991. (pp. 104-5, 222-4) While there she witnessed the bombing of Guernica. In 1938, Manning returned to Spain, where she wrote a report on the hospitals where British doctors and nurses were working. Back in England, she continued to be involved with the Basque children, visiting them and highlighting their plight. Manning was selected as Labour candidate for Epping and won the seat in the 1945 general election. In Parliament, she was known for her commitment to education. Defeated in the 1950 general election, she unsuccessfully contested Epping again in 1951 and 1955. ==Last years== Manning was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1966. She remained active in educational work (opposing comprehensive schools) and her autobiography (called A Life for Education) was published in 1970. Her last years, before her death at age 91, were spent in the NUT Home for Retired Teachers at Elstree, England. ==Legacy== She was remembered in 2002 by the renaming of a Bilbao square as Plaza de Mrs Leah Manning; a commemorative plaque from the Basque Children of '37 Association was presented to the British House of Commons.BBC history of the Basque Children; accessed 3 April 2014. A room is named in her honour at Homerton College, Cambridge.Homerton Conferencing; accessed 26 July 2016.

The first generation Sephia was badged Kia Mentor in some markets, and as the Timor S515/S516 in Indonesia. This convention continued on with the second generation version, which was also badged Kia Shuma and Kia Spectra. == First generation (1992‚Äì1997) == The first-generation Kia Sephia is the first car that was actually designed by Kia with their own chassis. Engines available were the B-series engines, with the 1.5-liter rated at , the 1.6-liter , and the 1.8-liter BP engine at from 1994. The car was presented in September 1992 to replace the aging Capital, which was rapidly losing market share. The Sephia proved quite successful, selling over 100,000 in its first full year in the home market (1993). A total of 472,920 Sephias were sold over the life of the original Sephia. In the United States, sales began in late 1993 for the 1994 model year. This was the first Kia to be exported to the US. An update came in the 1995 model year when grilles and taillights were restyled and all US- market Sephias except California-market RS/LS models got upgraded to the new 1.8-liter DOHC four-cylinder BP engine as used in the Mazda Familia (BG). Kia licensed the engine design from Mazda, but manufactured it themselves. It was launched in Europe in the spring of 1994 as the Kia Sephia in some markets and in others, including the United Kingdom, as the Kia Mentor. It was similar in size to best-selling European small family cars like the Ford Escort, but was priced similarly to smaller cars like the Ford Fiesta. Its key rivals in Europe were budget-priced Eastern European and Far Eastern imported products including the Daewoo Nexia, Hyundai Accent, Proton Persona and Skoda Felicia. In Brazil, the car went on the market in March 1994. It was only offered with the 1.5-liter twin cam engine with and was considered a competitor to the domestically built Chevrolet Omega and Volkswagen Santana. To make a car suitable for the Brazilian market, Kia went through the trouble of studying Brazilian road surfacing and importing of Brazilian gasoline to properly program the engine management. Kia presented a conceptual convertible version of the first generation Sephia, which was named \\"Kia Sephia Cabrio\\" at some auto shows. === Timor S5 series === The Sephia-derived Timor S5 series was meant to become the national car of Indonesia, and was sold there in the mid-1990s. It was intended fill a role similar to that of Malaysia's Proton, and as such was exempt from taxes and duties levied on other cars sold in the country. It was sold by PT Timor Putra Nasional, owned by then-President Suharto's son Tommy Suharto. Timor S515 The Timor S5 range consisted of the \\"S515\\" (SOHC carbureted), \\"S515i\\" (DOHC, fuel injected), and \\"S516i LE\\" (sports-oriented limited edition, licensed by Prodrive). Timor also had plans in place for an \\"SW516i\\" station wagon and a \\"SL516i\\" limousine. Between June 1996 and July 1997, 39,715 cars were imported. Escaping import tax, luxury tax, and an import surcharge meant that the Timor was sold at half the price of a comparable Toyota Corolla. The Timor S5 was briefly assembled locally in Timor plant in Purwakarta, West Java with imported parts in 1998 before its discontinuation due to WTO disputes. == Second generation (1997‚Äì2003) == In 1997, the Sephia was completely redesigned as a four-door sedan and five-door liftback, this time in-house by Kia itself with help from Mazda. Kia used a DOHC 1.5-liter and its own new DOHC 1.8-liter engine (the T8D engine, originally developed for the Kia Elan) and an improved air conditioning system. In South Korea, the Sephia label was retired in 2000 and replaced by the Spectra. The Sephia production totals were 628,168. The North American market received the Sephia sedan for the 1998 model year. For the 2000 model year, the liftback variant was launched, sold under the name \\"Kia Spectra\\". The Sephia (sedan) and Spectra (liftback) continued to be sold alongside one another until the 2002 model year updates were introduced. As part of this update, both body variants were facelifted, and the range was rationalized under the single \\"Kia Spectra\\" name. Three trim levels were available in the US: an entry level \\"S\\", slightly upgraded \\"GS\\", and the top-of-the-range \\"GSX\\". Arab American Vehicles (AAV) manufactured the Spectra in Cairo, Egypt, circa 2002. In Russia production of the Spectra continued until 2011, produced by Izh-Avto. The Spectra liftback was also assembled in Malaysia between 2001 and 2010. Production began at the HICOM AMM plant in Pekan, and was later transferred to Naza's NAM plant in Gurun. ;Australia The second generation Sephia sedan and liftback were badged \\"Mentor\\" in Australia when released in May 1998. Kia offered an entry-level \\"SLX\\" with the 1.5-liter inline-four engine, standard with five-speed manual transmission or optional four-speed automatic, and equipped with power steering, air conditioning, and cloth trim. The higher-specification \\"GLX\\" added central locking, power windows and mirrors, more upmarket trim, plus the option of the larger 1.8-liter engine on the liftback variant. From June 2000, following the change of distributor in Australia to Ateco, Kia discontinued the sedan variant and rebadged the liftback \\"Shuma\\". Along with the sedan, Kia dispensed with the 1.5-liter engine and SLX/GLX model identifiers. In their place, Kia offered an entry- level \\"Shuma\\" and a limited edition \\"Shuma FX\\", which added alloy wheels, central locking, power windows and mirrors, improved audio and higher-grade trim to the base model's air-conditioning and power steering. The Shuma also benefited from a minor facelift, which changed the tail-lamp lenses, wheels and interior trimmings. When the car was facelifted once more in May 2001, Kia rebranded it once more to \\"Spectra\\". This update brought redesigned headlights, a new front bumper, adjustments to suspension calibration, and an overhauled four-speed automatic. Equipment-wise, the single-specification \\"LS\\" offered a driver's airbag, seatbelt pretensioners and immobiliser were added, along with standard powered mirrors and windows and a host of minor trim upgrades. Kia Australia discontinued the Spectra in 2004. == Other versions == === Latin America (LD; 2003‚Äì2005) === Although the Sephia's successor, the Kia Cerato, was released in 2003, this replacement vehicle was still named Sephia for Latin America until 2005, when it was discontinued in favor of the name Spectra, as used in North America. === Sephia Taxi (DC; 2003‚Äì2005) === Some models of the first generation Kia Rio, were sold in certain countries of South America, such like Colombia, as \\"Sephia Taxi\\" already prepared with the legal requirements to work as Taxi cabs, including the yellow body paint. The Sephia Taxi came with the smaller displacement engine for that body (1.4-liter) and manual transmission. === Sephia Taxi (JB; 2005‚Äì2011) === Kia Sephia Taxi (JB) The second generation Kia Rio also sold in certain countries of South America as \\"Sephia Taxi\\". === Grand Sephia (RD; 2008‚Äì2012) === Kia Grand Sephia Taxi (TD) Some models of the Kia Forte, were also prepared to be sold as taxi cabs for certain countries of Latin America. The Grand Sephia has the smaller displacement engine available for that body (1.6-liter), and manual transmission. === Sephia Taxi (2020‚Äìpresent) === The Sephia nameplate once again is used as a taxi nameplate in Colombia, this time it is based on the Chinese-built Kia Pegas/Soluto. == References == == External links == * Kia Sephia Owner's Manual (1st generation) * Sephia Category:Compact cars Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Hatchbacks Category:Sedans Category:Cars introduced in 1992 Category:2000s cars ","title":"Kia Sephia"},{"id":"1437046","text":"A k≈çban in the Ginza district of Tokyo A k≈çban in Kameari, Katsushika, Tokyo ‚Äì the model for the k≈çban in the manga Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari K≈çen-mae Hashutsujo A is a small neighborhood police station found in Japan.

He won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1970 as co- writer of \\"For All We Know\\". ==Early life== Griffin was born in Cincinnati, Ohio and grew up in Memphis, Tennessee. His musical training began when his parents signed him up for accordion lessons. He attended Kingsbury High School in Memphis and Dorsey and Johnny Burnette were his neighbors and role models. After the Burnette brothers moved to Los Angeles, California to further their music careers, Griffin went there to visit them, and managed to secure a recording contract with Reprise Records. ==Career== ===Solo performing and songwriting=== His first album, Summer Holiday, was released in 1963. He had small roles in two films, For Those Who Think Young (1964) and None but the Brave (1965). In the 1960s, Griffin teamed with fellow songwriter Michael Z. Gordon to write songs for such diverse singers as Ed Ames, Gary Lewis, Bobby Vee, Brian Hyland, The Standells, Lesley Gore, Sandy Nelson and Cher. The pair won a BMI award for \\"Apologize\\". Griffin met Robb Royer through Maria Yolanda Aguayo (Griffin's future wife). The two hit it off immediately and became life-time collaborators both as performers and writers. Griffin was a staff writer with Viva Publishing and managed to get them to hire Royer as his co- writer in 1967. Viva was resistant to hiring Royer and instead wanted Griffin to write with another staff writer with the company. According to Royer, Griffin convinced Viva to hire Royer by threatening \\"I will be writing with him. Do you really want to give away half the publishing on all those songs?\\". James Griffin sang songs that were featured in a few episodes of the TV series 'Ironside' in the late sixties. ===Bread=== In 1968, Griffin and Royer teamed with David Gates to form the band Bread using session drummer Jim Gordon for their first album and their initial gigs. Mike Botts soon replaced Gordon as the band's permanent drummer, first appearing on their second album, On the Waters. In 1970, Griffin and Royer ‚Äì under the pseudonyms Arthur James and Robb Wilson ‚Äì wrote the lyrics for Fred Karlin's music for the song \\"For All We Know,\\" featured in the film Lovers and Other Strangers. It won the Academy Award for Best Song.This song was later covered by The Carpenters on their third album. In 1971 Royer left Bread, but continued to provide songs co- written with Griffin for the group, he was replaced by keyboardist/guitarist Larry Knechtel. They had a number one Billboard Hot 100 hit with the song, \\"Make It With You\\". Other hits by Bread included \\"Baby I'm-a Want You\\", \\"If\\" and \\"Everything I Own.\\" Although Griffin was a significant contributor to Bread's albums as a writer and singer, every one of the group's thirteen songs that made the Billboard Hot 100 chart was written and sung by Gates, a situation that created friction between the two. After the release of Guitar Man in 1972, Bread went on hiatus. Griffin released a solo album, Breakin' Up Is Easy on Polydor Records in 1973, credited to 'James Griffin & Co'. Neither the album nor the singles, \\"Breakin' Up Is Easy,\\" and \\"She Knows,\\" made the Billboard charts. Bread reformed in 1976 for one final album, Lost Without Your Love. Gates, Botts, and Knechtel continued to record together on Gates's solo albums, and initially toured as 'David Gates & Bread', which led to a lawsuit from Griffin. The dispute was not resolved until 1984. Griffin and Gates put aside their past differences for a Bread reunion tour in 1996‚Äì1997 with Botts and Knechtel. ===Black Tie=== In 1977, Griffin released a third solo album, James Griffin, also on Polydor, with tracks recorded in 1974 and 1975. He teamed with Terry Sylvester (formerly of The Hollies) on the album Griffin & Sylvester in 1982 and was a member of Black Tie with Randy Meisner and Billy Swan, which released When The Night Falls in 1985, co-produced by T-Bone Burnett. Robb Royer was also credited as a musician on the album. The album was remixed and reissued in the early 1990s, with Griffin's voice more prominent on some songs. The Black Tie single \\"Learning The Game\\" peaked at No. 59 on the Billboard country chart in 1991. ===The Remingtons=== In 1991 Griffin formed The Remingtons with Richard Mainegra and Rick Yancey. They released their first single that same year, followed by the albums Blue Frontier (1992) and Aim for the Heart (1993). Their single, \\"A Long Time Ago\\" went Top 10 on Billboard's country chart in 1992 with \\"Two-Timin' Me\\" cracking the Top 20 later that year. ===Toast/Radio Dixie=== Beginning in 1994 Griffin and Robb Royer collaborated with Grammy-nominated songwriter and multi- instrumentalist Todd Cerney to write songs and perform in local venues. Larry Knechtel also participated in the collaboration and the group called themselves Toast (an obvious reference to Bread). Griffin, Royer and Cerney began this collaboration when they wrote \\"Kyrie\\" in 1994. Knechtel also joined songwriting credits on the 1995 song \\"Slow Train.\\" The group wrote, recorded and performed together at various Nashville Venues including the Bluebird Cafe, 3rd & Lindsley, and 12th & Porter. In 1998 they changed the name to \\"Radio Dixie\\" in an effort to be more commercially viable. The group disbanded in 1998, although Royer and Cerney continued to collaborate on song-writing. ===GYG=== In 2003, Griffin, Rick Yancey and Ronnie Guilbeau began writing and performing as GYG, recording a CD of the same name. The CD included new material and well-known tunes like \\"Who's Gonna Know\\", a Remingtons tune recorded by Conway Twitty, and \\"Call It Love\\" a No. 1 hit for Poco written by Ronnie Guilbeau. GYG was performing at numerous Nashville venues including the 2004 CRS Conference and making further plans to shop the CD to indie labels and take the act on the road at the time of Griffin's sickness and death. In early 2004, Griffin recorded a duet with Holly Cieri of his Oscar-winning song \\"For All We Know\\". During that same year, Griffin also collaborated with Michael Z. Gordon and Griffin recorded the song, \\"Something Else Altogether\\" which was slated to be the title song for the film, \\"The Devil and Daniel Webster\\".

He was first a Fabian socialist, and follower of Victorian thinkers William Morris and John Ruskin.Stephen Dorril, Blackshirt: Sir Oswald Mosley and British Fascism, p. 73, calls Penty a disciple of Morris. He is generally credited with the formulation of a Christian socialist form of the medieval guild, as an alternative basis for economic life. Edwardian Architecture: A Biographical Dictionary - Page 283 https://books.google.co.uk/books?id A. Stuart Gray - 1986 Penty was the elder of the two architect sons of Walter Green Penty of York, designer of the York Institute of Art, Science and Literature. While a pupil and assistant with his father, Penty absorbed the spirit of the Arts and Crafts Movement and the progressive movement in Glasgow. ==Early life== Arthur Penty was born at 16 Elmwood Street, in the parish of St Lawrence, York, the second son of Walter Green Penty (1852‚Äì1902), architect, and his wife, Emma Seller. After attending St Peter's School in York he was apprenticed in 1888 to his father. ==Architect in York== When, in the 1890s, Penty joined his father's architectural practice, now renamed as Penty & Penty, \\"a marked improvement in the quality and originality of the firm's work\\" ensued. Among surviving buildings by Walter and Arthur Penty are: *1894: The Bay Horse, a public house in Marygate. *1895-6: Rowntree Wharf on the River Foss, originally a flour warehouse for Leetham's Mill, which burnt down in 1931, now flats and offices. *1899: Terry Memorial almshouses in Skeldergate. *1900‚Äì02: Buildings in River Street, Colenso Street and Lower Darnborough Street in the Clementhorpe area south of the River Ouse. He attracted national and even international attention, including favourable notice in Herman Muthesius's Das englische Haus (1904). His younger brother, Frederick T. Penty (1879‚Äì1943) took over the business after their father died. Arthur's other younger brother, George Victor Penty (1885‚Äì1967), emigrated to Australia to pursue a career in the wool industry. ==Move to London== Around 1900 Penty had met A. R. Orage; together with Holbrook Jackson they founded the Leeds Arts Club. Penty left his father's office in 1901, and moved to London in 1902 to pursue his interest in the arts and crafts movement. Orage and Jackson followed in 1905 and 1906; Penty in fact led the way, and Orage lodged with him in his first attempts to live by writing. ==Influence== For a time, from 1906, Penty's ideas were widely influential. Orage, as editor of The New Age, was a convert to guild socialism. After World War I guild socialism dropped back as a factor in the thinking of the British Labour movement, in general; the idea of post- industrialism, on which Penty wrote, attributing the term to A. K. Coomaraswamy, receded in importance in the face of the economic conditions. Several of Penty's books were translated into German in the early 1920s. Penty was an acknowledged influence on the writings of Spain's Ramiro de Maeztu (1875‚Äì1936), who was murdered by Communists in the early days of the Spanish Civil War. ==Penty the distributist== The somewhat complex British development of distributism emerged as a conjuncture of ideas of Penty, Hilaire Belloc and the Chestertons, Cecil and Gilbert. It reflected in part a first split from the Fabian socialists of the whole New Age group, in the form of the Fabian Arts Group of 1907. Orage was a believer in Guild socialism for a period. After C. H. Douglas met Orage in 1918, and Orage invented the term Social Credit for the Douglas theories, there was in effect a further split into 'left' (Social Crediters) and 'right' (distributist) thinkers. This is, though, fairly misleading as a classification; it was also to some extent a split between theosophist and Catholic camps. Penty associated with the Catholic Ditchling Community. Penty went with the distributists. Distributism in the 1920s took its own direction, as Belloc wrote his version of it in the period 1920 to 1925 and connected it with his political theories. The British Labour Party declared against Social Credit in 1922. ==Works== * The Restoration of the Gild System, Swan Sonnenschein and Co., 1906. ** \\"The Restoration of the Guild System,\\" The New Age, Vol. XIII, No. 14, 1913. ** \\"The Restoration of the Guild System II,\\" The New Age, Vol. XIII, No. 15, 1913. ** \\"The Restoration of the Guild System III,\\" The New Age, Vol. XIII, No. 16, 1913. ** \\"The Restoration of the Guild System IV,\\" The New Age, Vol. XIII, No. 17, 1913. ** \\"The Restoration of the Guild System V,\\" The New Age, Vol. XIII, No. 18, 1913. ** \\"The Restoration of the Guild System VI,\\" The New Age, Vol. XIII, No. 19, 1913. ** \\"The Restoration of the Guild System VII,\\" The New Age, Vol. XIII, No. 20, 1913. * \\"The Peril of Large Organisations,\\" The New Age, Vol. X, No. 13, 1912. * \\"Art as a Factor in Social Reform,\\" The New Age, Vol. XIV, No. 13, 1914. * \\"Art and National Guilds,\\" The New Age, Vol. XIV, No. 16, 1914. * \\"Art and Revolution,\\" The New Age, Vol. XIV, No. 20, 1914. * \\"Guilds and Versatility,\\" The New Age, Vol. XIV, No. 21, 1914. * \\"Aestheticism and History,\\" The New Age, Vol. XIV, No. 22, 1914. * \\"The Leisure State,\\" The New Age, Vol. XIV, No. 23, 1914. * \\"The Upside Down Problem,\\" The New Age, Vol. XIV, No. 24, 1914. * \\"Mediaevalism and Modernism,\\" The New Age, Vol. XIV, No. 25, 1914. * \\"Art and Plutocracy,\\" The New Age, Vol. XV, No. 1, 1914. * \\"Fabians, Pigeons, and Dogs,\\" The New Age, Vol. XV, No. 2, 1914. * \\"Liberty and Art,\\" The New Age, Vol. XV, No. 5, 1914. * Essays on Post-Industrialism (1914) edited with Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy * Old Worlds for New, George Allen & Unwin ltd., 1917. * \\"After the War,\\" The New Age, Vol. XX, No. 11, 1917, pp. 246‚Äì248. * \\"The Function of the State,\\" The New Age, Vol. XXII, No. 9, 1917, pp. 165‚Äì166. * \\"National Guilds v. the Class War,\\" The New Age, Vol. XXIII, No. 16, 1918, pp. 250‚Äì253. * \\"Dance of Siva,\\" The New Age, Vol. XXIII, No. 17, 1918, pp. 274‚Äì275. * \\"On the Class War Again,\\" The New Age, Vol. XXIII, No. 21, 1918, pp. 330‚Äì331. * \\"Syndicalism and the Neo- Marxians,\\" The New Age, Vol. XXIII, No. 24, 1918, pp. 376‚Äì377. * \\"The Neo- Marxians and the Materialist Conception of History,\\" The New Age, Vol. XXIII, No. 25, 1918, pp. 393‚Äì394. * \\"A Guildsman's Interpretation of History,\\" The New Age, Vol. XXIV, No. 1, 1918, pp. 5‚Äì7. * \\"National Guild Theory,\\" The New Age, Vol. XXIV, No. 2, 1918, p. 31\\\\. * \\"A Guildsman's Interpretation of History: From Rome to the Guilds,\\" The New Age, Vol. XXIV, No. 3, 1918, pp. 38‚Äì41. * Guilds and the Social Crisis, G.

Its seat is the Cathedral Church of Saint Peter, Saint Paul and Saint Andrew, which was founded as a monastery in AD 655 and re-built in its present form between 1118 and 1238. ==History== Founded at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1541 (it was until then part of the Diocese of Lincoln), the Diocese has parishes in: *The Soke of Peterborough *The county of Northamptonshire and *The county of Rutland. Until 1927 the Peterborough diocese covered what is now the (modern) Diocese of Leicester. Peterborough Abbey became a cathedral at the Reformation, one of six wholly new bishoprics founded under Henry VIII. On 4 September 1541 letters patent were issued converting the abbey church of Peterborough into a cathedral church, with a dean and chapter and ecclesiastical staff. The last abbot, John Chambers, was consecrated in his former abbey church on 23 October 1541 as the first Bishop of Peterborough. A link with the Anglican Church of Kenya Diocese of Bungoma was formed by the two bishops following the Lambeth Conference in 1998. ==Organisation== The Diocese is divided into two Archdeaconries: *The Archdeaconry of Northampton, and *The Archdeaconry of Oakham. The parts of the City of Peterborough that are south of the River Nene and so, were in the historic county of Huntingdonshire rather than the Soke of Peterborough, fall within the Diocese of Ely.

Bush administration after the resignation of Rosario Marin. ==Early life== Cabral, a second-generation Mexican-American, was born in San Bernardino, California to Francisco Escobedo and Teresa Beltran. Her father's family had come to the United States from Mexico in the early 1900s as did her maternal grandmother. Alfred Escobedo, her paternal grandfather, also participated in the Bracero Program. Cabral's maternal grandfather was a Native American, born and raised on a reservation in Southern California and her maternal grandmother was from Mexico.Committee on Finance, United States Senate, \\"Nomination of Anna Escobedo Cabral to be U.S. Treasurer,\\" S.

By age 16, Cabral was already on track to finishing high school early; after graduation, she intended to find a full-time job to help her parents financially. Her math teacher, Philip Lamm, convinced her instead to consider higher education. Lamm, she recalled in a later interview, \\"hand wrote the application. He told me that this was a better plan and found scholarship money for me to go to college.\\" Lamm also helped her overcome her family's initial misgivings. Cabral initially attended the University of California at Santa Cruz majoring in political science. In her sophomore year, she met Victor Cabral, a law student at the University of California, Davis; not long after this, she transferred to Davis. Between her sophomore and junior years, the couple was married and Cabral soon left school for a few years to raise a family. During this time, she also managed her husband's law firm. Cabral eventually returned to the University and graduated in 1987 with a bachelor's degree in political science. After considering several graduate schools, Cabral enrolled in a joint-degree program with the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and the Boalt Hall School of Law at UC Berkeley. She and her family moved to Massachusetts. However, halfway through the program, Cabral decided to withdraw in order to take care of family needs. In 1990, she obtained her Master of Public Administration degree from Harvard.United States Department of the Treasury, Treasury Officials (archived). Accessed on August 11, 2009. She eventually completed her Juris Doctor degree at George Mason University School of Law in 2008.http://www.linkedin.com/pub/anna-escobedo-cabral/13/8a8/114 ==Public career== In 1990, Cabral's husband obtained a job with the Justice Department; the rest of the family moved with him to Washington, D.C. The following year, Cabral became Executive Staff Director of the Task Force on Hispanic Affairs in the Senate Republican Conference. In this capacity, she managed a caucus of 25 U.S. Senators working on issues related to the Hispanic community.Office of Public Affairs, U.S. Department of the Treasury, \\"Anna Escobedo Cabral Sworn in as U.S. Treasurer,\\" (press release) JS-2203 (January 19, 2005). Cabral's work came to the attention of Senator Orrin G. Hatch, who was chair of the Task Force as well as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In 1993, in addition to her work with the Republican Conference, Cabral assumed the post of Deputy Staff Director for the committee, helping it to oversee federal judicial nominations as well as various Justice-related legislation. After several years, Cabral left government service but remained in the public sector. In 1999, she was hired as president and CEO of Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility. A Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit coalition of 16 of the largest Hispanic organizations in the nation, HACR worked with Fortune 500 companies to increase Hispanic representation in employment, procurement, philanthropy, and governance. Under Cabral's leadership, HACR published a best practices series, and instituted a partnership with Harvard Business School to provide executive training programs in Corporate Governance Best Practices to community leaders.Hispanic PR Wire-US Newswire, \\"Smithsonian Names Anna Escobedo Cabral Director of the Institution's Center for Latino Initiatives,\\" HispanicBusiness.com (June 9, 2003). Cabral participated on a number of advisory panels during this time. In 2002, she was appointed by President George W. Bush to his Council on the 21st Century Workplace, providing guidance to the White House and the Department of Labor on work-related issues. That same year, she was named to a two-year term on the Diversity Council of the Premier Automotive Group, an outreach effort of the Ford Motor Company. She also served on the boards of the Sewall‚ÄìBelmont House and Museum, a historic center commemorating women's suffrage, and Martha's Table, a nonprofit that assists the less fortunate to better themselves through volunteer activities. In 2003, Cabral was named Director of the Center for Latino Initiatives at the Smithsonian Institution. While at the center, she led a pan-institutional effort to improve Latino representation in exhibits and public programming among the Institution's 19 museums, five research centers, and the National Zoo.

She also provided advice and counsel to the Treasury Department in its efforts to provide economic assistance to devastated areas. Despite a heavy work schedule and numerous speaking engagements, Cabral returned to school in order to obtain her juris doctorate. She was inspired in this move by her mother, who returned to school at age 52 to get her diploma. In 2005, she began taking night courses at the Arlington campus of the George Mason University School of Law. In her second year, her daughter Catalina was a fellow George Mason student.Lee Benson, \\"U.S. official treasures basketball,\\" Deseret News (March 29, 2006).

Through its own facilities and agreements with other providers, GCI provides cable television service, Internet access, wireline (networking) and cellular telephone service. It is a subsidiary of Colorado-based company Qurate Retail Group (formerly Liberty Interactive), having been acquired by them in 2015. ==History== GCI was founded in 1979 by Ron Duncan and Bob Walp. On November 10, 2005, the company reported third-quarter profits of $2.3 million, down from $9.3 million during the same three months of 2004. ==Products== ===Television=== Based in Anchorage, GCI provides cable television service to approximately three-quarters of Alaska residents. GCI has upgraded most of its network to support digital cable broadcasts and provides high-definition broadcasts in some of the state's larger cities. GCI leases an array of analog and digital cable boxes, including HD and DVR digital cable boxes, to its customers. In 2008, GCI discontinued analog cable service to Anchorage residences, moving to a fully digital platform. GCI also provides content to the state-operated Alaska Rural Communications Service satellite system, which in turn provides free over-the-air broadcasts of commercial and public television programs to 235 rural Alaskan communities. On November 9, 2012, GCI announced plans to purchase KTVA, a CBS-affiliated television station in Anchorage, along with KATH-LD and KSCT-LP, the NBC- affiliated stations in Southeast Alaska. On December 9, 2013, GCI filed to acquire the CBS affiliates in Southeast Alaska‚ÄîKXLJ-LD in Juneau, KTNL-TV in Sitka, and KUBD in Ketchikan. On July 31, 2020, GCI announced its intent to exit the television business and sold the non-license assets of KTVA to Gray Television. ===Internet=== GCI provides access to the Internet via multiple means. As of January 2015, GCI provides cable modem services in major cities in Alaska with download speeds up to 250 megabits per second or Mbps(re:D Plan). In mid 2015 GCI will be deploying its fiber re:D network in the Anchorage area first, with download speeds up to 1 gigabit per second(1,000Mbit/s). To start that campaign, GCI has increased its highest home internet plan (re:D) from 50MMbps to 100Mbit/s and then to 250Mbit/s for free in all available areas that has access to the re:D plan. The re:D plan is currently to this date $174.99 and when the re:D 1Gbit/s Fiber network launches, the price will remain the same. In the rural cities of Nome, Cordova, Bethel, and Utqiagvik, GCI provides high-speed cable modem services but uses a satellite for the backhaul connection, as the cost to lay cable to these remote areas is prohibitively expensive. In some rural communities where GCI does not have a cable TV infrastructure, it provides lower-bandwidth (56-512 kbit/s) wireless Internet access over a satellite backhaul. Through its own facilities and agreements with other providers, primarily Alaska Communications Systems, GCI provides data network and Internet connections via GPON DSL, PRI leased lines (such as a T1), and other high-bandwidth business- class products. These services are aimed at the business market. The state government is a major customer of GCI, using GCI's infrastructure to provide the backbone for the state's wide area network. GCI maintains local access numbers throughout the state for analog dial-up service. GCI however no longer offers dial up service to customer accounts, but will continue to support customers who are grandfathered into the service. GCI also owns Alaska United fiber optic cable system, which connects Anchorage and Fairbanks with Internet points of presence in Seattle and Portland. GCI leases capacity on their system to other Internet providers in Alaska, including Clearwire wireless broadband. ===Wireline telephone=== GCI offers local telephone service in many Alaskan markets as well as intrastate and interstate long-distance. As the competitive local exchange carrier, GCI primarily contracts with the incumbent local exchange carrier, Alaska Communications Systems, to provide the local loop from GCI's switches to customers. (This practice is known as UNE-loop.) GCI is currently deploying digital cable telephony based on PacketCable technology in Utqiagvik as a replacement for the analog copper. In GCI's implementation, the connection between the GCI head end and the subscriber's EMTA uses IP packets but is interconnected with GCI's more traditional circuit-switched infrastructure and backbone.Balancing Responsibilities and Rights: A Regulatory Model for Facilities-Based VoIP Competition, National Cable and Telecommunications Association, February 2004. Accessed via http://ncta.com/DocumentBinary.aspx?id=318 . GCI also provides legacy as well as Cisco VoIP telephony for many customers, including the state government. ===Wireless telephone=== Through an agreement with Dobson Communications Systems, which provided TDMA and GSM cellular service under the Cellular One brand, GCI formerly sold GSM cellular service under its own name while providing Dobson with the back-end network infrastructure. AT&T;'s purchase of Dobson, however, resulted in an agreement on December 3, 2007, that released Dobson, now under the AT&T; Wireless brand, from its contract to use GCI for its back-end network on July 1, 2008; AT&T; Wireless now uses existing AT&T; Alascom networks. GCI will continue to contract with AT&T; Wireless for the use and resale of its products and services through June 30, 2012, but will also invest $100 million in its own network. It also plans to spend approximately $10 million to complete its acquisition of the remaining 20% of Alaska DigiTel, a competing CDMA-based cellular carrier.Anchorage Daily News: GCI will pump $100 million into its network. Published January 12, 2008. On December 4, 2014, GCI agreed to purchase the wireless assets of Alaska Communications for $300 million.

The HTML or media elements shown in a frame may come from a different web site as the other elements of content on display, although this practice, known as framing, is today often regarded as a violation of same-origin policy and has been considered a form of copyright infringement. In HTML, a frameset is a group of named frames to which web pages and media can be directed; an iframe provides for a frame to be placed inside the body of a document. Since the early 2000s, the use of framesets has been considered obsolete due to usability and accessibility concerns, and the feature has been removed from the HTML5 standard. ==Tags and Attributes== The frames in HTML are created using the \`\` tag pair. The \`\` tag is a container tag for all other tags that are used to create frames. The \`\` tag replaces the \`\` tag in frameset documents. The \`\` tag defines how to divide the window into frames. Each frameset defines a set of rows or columns. If user define frames by using the \`rows\` attribute then horizontal frames are created. If user define frames by using \`cols\` then vertical frames are created. The \`\` element may be included so web browsers with frames disabled (or browsers that do not support frames) can display something to the user, as in this example: Your browser does not support frames. [Click here](http://www.example.com/frame_1.html) to view frame 1. [Click here](http://alt.example.com/frame_2.html) for frame 2. Framesets have a \`border\` attribute. If set to an integer greater than 0, the user can resize the frames by dragging this border, unless a \`noresize\` attribute is present in a frame element. If border is set to 0, no border will be displayed and content in different frames will abut each other without delineation. The \`iframe\` element is used inline within a normal HTML body, and defines the initial content and name similarly to the \`frame\` element. Any text inside an \`\` tag pair will be displayed in browsers that do not understand the iframe tag. Your browser does not support iframes. [Click here](http://www.example.com/frame_1.html) to view the content. ==History== Netscape Navigator 2.0 introduced the elements used for frames in March 1996. Other browser vendors such as Apple with Cyberdog followed later that year. At that time, Netscape proposed frames to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for inclusion in the HTML 3.0 standard. Frames were used to display and navigate early online magazines and web apps, such as webmail services and web chat sites. Frames had the advantage of allowing elements to be displayed sitewide without requiring server features such as server-side includes or CGI support. These features were not common on early web servers accessible to the public. Early websites often used a frame at the top to display a banner which could not be scrolled away. These banner frames sometimes included the site's logo as well as advertising. XHTML, intended as a successor to HTML 4, removed all frames in 1.1. The intended eventual replacement was XFrames, which attempts to solve the problem of addressing a populated frameset through composite URIs. The later HTML5 standard, which took a different approach from HTML 4, also removes framesets.HTML 5 differences from HTML 4: \\"The following elements are not in HTML 5 because their usage affected usability and accessibility for the end user in a negative way: frame, frameset, noframes\\" The \`iframe\` element, however, remains, with a number of \\"sandboxing\\" options intended for sharing content between sites.HTML 5 differences from HTML 4: \\"new sandboxing features for iframe\\" ==Advantages== By allowing content to be loaded and navigated independently, frames offered several advantages over the plain HTML in use when they were first developed: * Simplifying maintenance of content shared across all or most pages, such as navigation data. If an item needs to be added to a sidebar navigation menu, the web page author needs to change only one web page file, whereas each individual page on a traditional non- frameset website would have to be edited if the sidebar menu appeared on all of them. * Reducing the amount of bandwidth needed by not re-downloading parts of the page which had not changed. * Allowing several pieces of information to be viewed side by side, with the ability for each section to be scrolled independently. This might include the side-by-side comparison of two pictures or videos, or two different ways to understand something, such as an independently scrolling page of text next to video, images, animation, 3D rotating objects, etc. * Allowing footnotes or digressions to appear in a dedicated section of the page when linked to, so that the reader does not lose their place in the main text. ==Criticism== The practice of framing HTML content led to numerous criticisms, most centering on usability and accessibility concerns. These include: * Framing breaks the identity between the content and URL as displayed in the browser, making it difficult to link to or bookmark a particular item of content within the frameset * The implementation of frames is inconsistent across different browsers *Browsers which render material linearly do not handle frames well. **Screen reader programs **text or audio browsers **Email browsers such as Agora **Mobile browsers * Framing complicates web indexing and can be detrimental to search engine optimization. * Framing confuses the boundaries between content on different servers, which raises issues of copyright infringement * Visitors arriving from search engines may land on a page intended for display in a frame, resulting in the visitor having no way to navigate to the rest of the site * Frames change the behavior of the back button. * Users usually do not expect browsers to print frames the way they do. * External links on web pages which use frames may cause other pages to appear in the frameset, since the default behaviour for a link is to load in the current frame if the author does not specify otherwise. This could be used by unscrupulous webmasters to make it appear as though content from another site was actually part of the site hosting the frameset. * If the screen resolution or browser window size is too low then each frame will have scroll bars which can look messy and uses up already limited space. Such behaviour typically resulted more from bad site design (fixed layouts instead of fluid layouts), whereby not all frameset features were put into proper use. This behaviour could be mitigated by: **disabling scrolling for smaller frames that typically did not require a scrollbar; **using fluid design characteristics in target pages instead of fixed designs, so that the content would not cause horizontal scrollbars in the first place. ==Alternatives== As web technology developed, many of the purposes for which frames were used became possible in ways that avoided the problems identified with frames. * Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) allowed elements of a page to be scrolled independently (using the \`overflow\` property) or held on screen while other content is scrolled (using \`position:fixed\`) * Server-Side Includes allowed shared content to be edited once and automatically delivered to the client as part of a finished page; as server CPU and connection speeds increased, the extra work required to do this on the fly became a lesser consideration. * CGI and web-oriented scripting languages and web development frameworks such as PHP and Active Server Pages, as well as database-backed Content Management Systems such as WordPress, provided much richer options for maintaining content and providing navigation. * Client-side scripting and Dynamic HTML allowed parts of a page to be visually replaced based on a user's actions. This allowed much more flexibility for showing \\"side\\" content, such as footnotes or instructions, as these could now be displayed and hidden anywhere on the page rather than requiring a pre-defined frame. * AJAX allowed for dynamic display within a page of content even when it needs to be fetched from the server, for instance based on the logged in user or events elsewhere. Not all of problems identified with framesets are eliminated by using these alternative approaches; for instance issues with Back/Forward navigation, bookmarking, and indexing remain on many sites which make heavy use of DHTML / AJAX navigation. ==See also== * Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing * Frames * Inline linking * Deep linking * Framekiller * Tableless web design ==References== ==External links== * HTML Help: What's wrong with frames? * Dan's Web Tips: Frames * Script designed to prevent framing of your content Category:HTML Category:World Wide Web Category:Web 1.0 ","title":"Frame (World Wide Web)"},{"id":"1437123","text":"The red-billed quelea (;\\"Quelea\\". Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. Quelea quelea), also known as the red-billed weaver or red-billed dioch, is a small‚Äîapproximately long and weighing ‚Äîmigratory, sparrow-like bird of the weaver family, Ploceidae, native to Sub-Saharan Africa. It was named by Linnaeus in 1758, who considered it a bunting, but Ludwig Reichenbach assigned it in 1850 to the new genus Quelea. Three subspecies are recognised, with Quelea quelea quelea occurring roughly from Senegal to Chad, Q. q. aethiopica from Sudan to Somalia and Tanzania, and Q. q. lathamii from Gabon to Mozambique and South Africa. Non-breeding birds have light underparts, striped brown upper parts, yellow-edged flight feathers and a reddish bill. Breeding females attain a yellowish bill. Breeding males have a black (or rarely white) facial mask, surrounded by a purplish, pinkish, rusty or yellowish wash on the head and breast. The species avoids forests, deserts and colder areas such as those at high altitude and in southern South Africa. It constructs oval roofed nests woven from strips of grass hanging from thorny branches, sugar cane or reeds. It breeds in very large colonies. The quelea feeds primarily on seeds of annual grasses, but also causes extensive damage to cereal crops. Therefore, it is sometimes called \\"Africa's feathered locust\\". The usual pest-control measures are spraying avicides or detonating fire-bombs in the enormous colonies during the night. Extensive control measures have been largely unsuccessful in limiting the quelea population. When food runs out, the species migrates to locations of recent rainfall and plentiful grass seed; hence it exploits its food source very efficiently. It is regarded as the most numerous undomesticated bird on earth, with the total post-breeding population sometimes peaking at an estimated 1.5 billion individuals. It feeds in huge flocks of millions of individuals, with birds that run out of food at the rear flying over the entire group to a fresh feeding zone at the front, creating an image of a rolling cloud. The conservation status of red-billed quelea is least concern according to the IUCN Red List. == Taxonomy and naming == George Edwards published in 1760 The red-billed quelea was one of the many birds described originally by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae. Classifying it in the bunting genus Emberiza, he gave it the binomial name of Emberiza quelea. He incorrectly mentioned that it originated in India, probably because ships from the East Indies picked up birds when visiting the African coast during their return voyage to Europe. It is likely that he had seen a draft of Ornithologia, sive Synopsis methodica sistens avium divisionem in ordines, sectiones, genera, species, ipsarumque varietates, a book written by Mathurin Jacques Brisson that was to be published in 1760, and which contained a black and white drawing of the species. The erroneous type locality of India was corrected to Africa in the 12th edition of Systema Naturae of 1766, and Brisson was cited. Brisson mentions that the bird originates from Senegal, where it had been collected by Michel Adanson during his 1748-1752 expedition. He called the bird Moineau √† bec rouge du Senegal in French and Passer senegalensis erythrorynchos in Latin, both meaning \\"red-billed Senegalese sparrow\\". Also in 1766, George Edwards illustrated the species in colour, based on a live male specimen owned by a Mrs Clayton in Surrey. He called it the \\"Brazilian sparrow\\", despite being unsure whether it came from Brazil or Angola. In 1850, Ludwig Reichenbach thought the species was not a true bunting, but rather a weaver, and created the genus name Quelea, as well as the new combination Q. quelea. The white-faced morph was described as a separate species, Q. russii. Three subspecies are recognised. In the field, these are distinguished by differences in male breeding plumage. * The nominate subspecies, Quelea quelea quelea, is native to west and central Africa, where it has been recorded from Mauritania, western and northern Senegal, Gambia, central Mali, Burkina Faso, southwestern and southern Niger, northern Nigeria, Cameroon, south-central Chad and northern Central African Republic. * Loxia lathamii was described by Andrew Smith in 1836, but later assigned to Q. quelea as its subspecies lathamii. It ranges across central and southern Africa, where it has been recorded from southwestern Gabon, southern Congo, Angola (except the northeast and arid coastal southwest), southern Democratic Republic of Congo and the mouth of the Congo River, Zambia, Malawi and western Mozambique across to Namibia (except the coastal desert) and central, southern and eastern South Africa. * Ploceus aethiopicus was described by Carl Jakob Sundevall in 1850, but later assigned to Q. quelea as its subspecies aethiopica. It is found in eastern Africa where it occurs in southern Sudan, eastern South Sudan, Ethiopia and Eritrea south to the northeastern parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Kenya, central and eastern Tanzania and northwestern and southern Somalia. Formerly, two other subspecies have been described. Q. quelea spoliator was described by Phillip Clancey in 1960 on the basis of more greyish nonbreeding plumage of populations of wetter habitats of northeastern South Africa, Swaziland and southern Mozambique. However, further analysis indicated no clear distinction in plumage between it and Q. quelea lathamii, with no evidence of genetic isolation. Hence it is not recognised as distinct. Q. quelea intermedia, described by Anton Reichenow in 1886 from east Africa, is regarded a synonym of subspecies aethiopica. === Etymology and vernacular names === Linnaeus himself did not explain the name quelea. Quelea quelea is locally called kwelea domo-jekundu in Swahili, enzunge in Kwangali, chimokoto in Shona, inyonyane in Siswati, thaha in Sesotho and ndzheyana in the Tsonga language. M.W. Jeffreys suggested that the term came from medieval Latin qualea, meaning \\"quail\\", linking the prodigious numbers of queleas to the hordes of quail that fed the Israelites during the Exodus from Egypt. The subspecies lathamii is probably named in honor of the ornithologist John Latham. The name of the subspecies aethiopica refers to Ethiopia, and its type was collected in the neighbouring Sennar province in today's Sudan. \\"Red-billed quelea\\" has been designated the official name by the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). Other names in English include black-faced dioch, cardinal, common dioch, Latham's weaver-bird, pink-billed weaver, quelea finch, quelea weaver, red-billed dioch, red-billed weaver, Russ' weaver, South-African dioch, Sudan dioch and Uganda dioch. === Phylogeny === Based on recent DNA analysis, the red-billed quelea is the sister group of a clade that contains both other remaining species of the genus Quelea, namely the cardinal quelea (Q. cardinalis) and the red-headed quelea (Q. erythrops). The genus belongs to the group of true weavers (subfamily Ploceinae), and is most closely related to the fodies (Foudia), a genus of six or seven species that occur on the islands of the western Indian Ocean. These two genera are in turn the sister clade to the Asian species of the genus Ploceus. The following tree represents current insight of the relationships between the species of Quelea, and their closest relatives. Interbreeding between red-billed and red-headed queleas has been observed in captivity. == Description == The red-billed quelea is a small sparrow-like bird, approximately long and weighing , with a heavy, cone-shaped bill, which is red (in females outside the breeding season and males) or orange to yellow (females during the breeding season). Over 75% of males have a black facial \\"mask\\", comprising a black forehead, cheeks, lores and higher parts of the throat. Occasionally males have a white mask. The mask is surrounded by a variable band of yellow, rusty, pink or purple. White masks are sometimes bordered by black. This colouring may only reach the lower throat or extend along the belly, with the rest of the underparts light brown or whitish with some dark stripes. The upperparts have light and dark brown longitudinal stripes, particularly at midlength, and are paler on the rump. The tail and upper wing are dark brown. The flight feathers are edged greenish or yellow. The eye has a narrow naked red ring and a brown iris. The legs are orangey in colour. The bill is bright raspberry red. Outside the breeding season, the male lacks bright colours; it has a grey-brown head with dark streaks, whitish chin and throat, and a faint light stripe above the eyes. At this time, the bill becomes pink or dull red and the legs turn flesh-coloured. The females resemble the males in non-breeding plumage, but have a yellow or orangey bill and eye-ring during the breeding season. At other times, the female bill is pink or dull red. Newborns have white bills and are almost naked with some wisps of down on the top of the head and the shoulders. The eyes open during the fourth day, at the same time as the first feathers appear. Older nestlings have a horn-coloured bill with a hint of lavender, though it turns orange-purple before the post-juvenile moult. Young birds change feathers two to three months after hatching, after which the plumage resembles that of non-breeding adults, although the head is grey, the cheeks whitish, and wing coverts and flight feathers have buff margins. At an age of about five months they moult again and their plumage starts to look like that of breeding adults, with a pinkish-purple bill. Different subspecies are distinguished by different colour patterns of the male breeding plumage. In the typical subspecies, Q. quelea quelea, breeding males have a buff crown, nape and underparts and the black mask extends high up the forehead. In Q. quelea lathamii the mask also extends high up the forehead, but the underparts are mainly white. In Q. quelea aethiopica the mask does not extend far above the bill, and the underparts may have a pink wash. There is much variability within subspecies, and some birds cannot be ascribed to a subspecies based on outward appearance alone. Because of interbreeding, specimens intermediate between subspecies may occur where the ranges of the subspecies overlap, such as at Lake Chad. The female pin-tailed whydah could be mistaken for the red- billed quelea in non-breeding plumage, since both are sparrow-like birds with conical red-coloured bills, but the whydah has a whitish brow between a black stripe through the eye and a black stripe above.

After arriving at the roost or nest site, birds keep moving around and make a lot of noise for about half an hour before settling in. Both males and females call. The male sings in short bursts, starting with some chatter, followed by a warbling tweedle-toodle-tweedle. == Distribution and habitat == The red-billed quelea is mostly found in tropical and subtropical areas with a seasonal semi-arid climate, resulting in dry thornbush grassland, including the Sahel, and its distribution covers most of sub-Saharan Africa. It avoids forests, however, including miombo woodlands and rain forests such as those in central Africa, and is generally absent from western parts of South Africa and arid coastal regions of Namibia and Angola. It was introduced to the island of R√©union in 2000. Occasionally, it can be found as high as above sea-level, but mostly resides below . It visits agricultural areas, where it feeds on cereal crops, although it is thought to prefer seeds of wild annual grasses. It needs to drink daily and can only be found within about distance of the nearest body of water. It is found in wet habitats, congregating at the shores of waterbodies, such as Lake Ngami, during flooding. It needs shrubs, reeds or trees to nest and roost. Red-billed queleas migrate seasonally over long distances in anticipation of the availability of their main natural food source, seeds of annual grasses. The presence of these grass seeds is the result of the beginning of rains weeks earlier, and the rainfall varies in a seasonal geographic pattern. The temporarily wet areas do not form a single zone that periodically moves back and forth across the entirety of Sub-Saharan Africa, but rather consist of five or six regions, within which the wet areas \\"move\\" or \\"jump\\". Red-billed quelea populations thus migrate between the temporarily wet areas within each of these five to six geographical regions. Each of the subspecies, as distinguished by different male breeding plumage, is confined to one or more of these geographical regions. In Nigeria, the nominate subspecies generally travels southwards during the start of the rains in the north during June and July, when the grass seed germinates, and is no longer eaten by the queleas. When they reach the Benoue River valley, for instance, the rainy season has already passed and the grass has produced new seeds. After about six weeks, the birds migrate northwards to find a suitable breeding area, nurture a generation, and then repeat this sequence moving further north. Some populations may also move northwards when the rains have started, to eat the remaining ungerminated seeds. In Senegal migration is probably between the southeast and the northwest. In eastern Africa, the subspecies aethiopica is thought to consist of two sub-populations. One moves from Central Tanzania to southern Somalia, to return to breed in Tanzania in February and March, followed by successive migrations to breed ever further north, the season's last usually occurring in central Kenya during May. The second group moves from northern and central Sudan and central Ethiopia in May and June, to breed in southern Sudan, South Sudan, southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya, moving back north from August to October. In southern Africa, the total population of the subspecies Q. quelea lathamii in October converges on the Zimbabwean Highveld. In November, part of the population migrates to the northwest to northwestern Angola, while the remainder migrates to the southeast to southern Mozambique and eastern South-Africa, but no proof has been found that these migration cohorts are genetically or morphologically divergent. == Ecology and behaviour == The red-billed quelea is regarded as the most numerous undomesticated bird on earth, with the total post-breeding population sometimes peaking at an estimated 1¬Ω billion individuals. The species is specialised on feeding on seeds of annual grass species, which may be ripe, or still green, but have not germinated yet. Since the availability of these seeds varies with time and space, occurring in particular weeks after the local off-set of rains, queleas migrate as a strategy to ensure year-round food availability. The consumption of a lot of food with a high energy content is needed for the queleas to gain enough fat to allow migration to new feeding areas. When breeding, it selects areas such as lowveld with thorny or spiny vegetation‚Äîtypically Acacia species‚Äîbelow elevation. While foraging for food, they may fly each day and return to the roosting or nesting site in the evening. Small groups of red-billed queleas often mix with different weaver birds (Ploceus) and bishops (Euplectes), and in western Africa they may join the Sudan golden sparrow (Passer luteus) and various estrildids. Red-billed queleas may also roost together with weavers, estrildids and barn swallows. Their life expectancy is two to three years in the wild, but one captive bird lived for eighteen years. ===Breeding=== Two males of subsp. lathamii at their nest site The red-billed quelea needs of precipitation to breed, with nest building usually commencing four to nine weeks after the onset of the rains. Nests are usually built in stands of thorny trees such as umbrella thorn acacia (Vachellia tortilis), blackthorn (Senegalia mellifera) and sicklebush (Dichrostachys cinerea), but sometimes in sugar cane fields or reeds. Colonies can consist of millions of nests, in densities of 30,000 per ha (12,000 per acre). Over 6000 nests in a single tree have been counted. At Malilangwe in Zimbabwe one colony was long and wide. In southern Africa, suitable branches are stripped of leaves a few days in advance of the offset of nest construction. The male starts the nest by creating a ring of grass by twining strips around both branches of a hanging forked twig, and from there bridging the gaps in the circle his beak can reach, having one foot on each of the branchlets, using the same footholds and the same orientation throughout the building process. Two parallel stems of reeds or sugar cane can also be used to attach the nest from. They use both their bills and feet in adding the initial knots needed. As soon as the ring is finished the male displays, trying to attract a female, after which the nest may be completed in two days. The nest chamber is created in front of the ring. The entrance may be constructed after the egg laying has started, while the male works from the outside. A finished nest looks like a small oval or globular ball of grass, around 18 cm (7 in) high and 16 cm (6 in) wide, with a 2.5 cm (1 in) wide entrance high up one side, sheltered by a shallow awning. About six to seven hundred fresh, green grass strips are used for each nest. This species may nest several times per year when conditions are favourable. In the breeding season, males are diversely coloured. These differences in plumage do not signal condition, probably serving instead for the recognition of individual birds. However, the intensity of the red on the bills is regarded an indicator of the animal's quality and social dominance. Red-billed quelea males mate with one female only within one breeding cycle. There are usually three eggs in each clutch (though the full range is one to five) of approximately long and in diameter. The eggs are light bluish or greenish in colour, sometimes with some dark spots. Some clutches contain six eggs, but large clutches may be the result of other females dumping an egg in a stranger's nest. Both sexes share the incubation of the eggs during the day, but the female alone does so during the cool night, and feeds during the day when air temperatures are high enough to sustain the development of the embryo. The breeding cycle of the red-billed quelea is one of the shortest known in any bird. Incubation takes nine or ten days. After the chicks hatch, they are fed for some days with protein-rich insects. Later the nestlings mainly get seeds. The young birds fledge after about two weeks in the nest. They are sexually mature in one year. === Feeding === Resting in the branches during the dayFlocks of red- billed queleas usually feed on the ground, with birds in the rear constantly leap-frogging those in the front to exploit the next strip of fallen seeds. This behaviour creates the impression of a rolling cloud, and enables efficient exploitation of the available food. The birds also take seeds from the grass ears directly. They prefer grains of in size. Red-billed queleas feed mainly on seeds from a wide range of species, including annual grasses of the genera Echinochloa, Panicum, Setaria, Sorghum, Tetrapogon and Urochloa. One survey at Lake Chad showed that two thirds of the seeds eaten belonged to only three species: African wild rice (Oryza barthii), Sorghum purpureosericeum and jungle rice (Echinochloa colona). When the supply of these seeds runs out, seeds of cereals such as barley (Hordeum disticum), teff (Eragrostis tef), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), manna (Setaria italica), millet (Panicum miliaceum), rice (Oryza sativa), wheat (Triticum), oats (Avena aestiva), as well as buckwheat (Phagopyrum esculentum) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) are eaten on a large scale. Red-billed queleas have also been observed feeding on crushed corn from cattle feedlots, but entire maize kernels are too big for them to swallow. A single bird may eat about in seeds each day. As much as half of the diet of nestlings consists of insects, such as grasshoppers, ants, beetles, bugs, caterpillars, flies and termites, as well as snails and spiders. Insects are generally eaten during the breeding season, though winged termites are eaten at other times. Breeding females consume snail-shell fragments and calcareous grit, presumably to enable egg- shell formation. One colony in Namibia, of an estimated five million adults and five million chicks, was calculated to consume roughly of insects and of grass seeds during its breeding cycle. At sunrise they form flocks that co- operate to find food. After a successful search, they settle to feed. In the heat of the day, they rest in the shade, preferably near water, and preen. Birds seem to prefer drinking at least twice a day. In the evening, they once again fly off in search of food. === Predators and parasites === Flocking at a waterholeNatural enemies of the red-billed quelea include other birds, snakes, warthogs, squirrels, galagos, monkeys, mongooses, genets, civets, foxes, jackals, hyaenas, cats, lions and leopards. Bird species that prey on queleas include the lanner falcon, tawny eagle and marabou stork. The diederik cuckoo is a brood parasite that probably lays eggs in nests of queleas. Some predators, such as snakes, raid nests and eat eggs and chicks. Nile crocodiles sometimes attack drinking queleas, and an individual in Ethiopia hit birds out of the vegetation on the bank into the water with its tail, subsequently eating them. Queleas drinking at a waterhole were grabbed from below by African helmeted turtles in Etosha. Among the invertebrates that kill and eat youngsters are the armoured bush cricket (Acanthoplus discoidalis) and the scorpion Cheloctonus jonesii. Internal parasites found in queleas include Haemoproteus and Plasmodium. == Interactions with humans == The red-billed quelea is caught and eaten in many parts of Africa. Around Lake Chad, three traditional methods are used to catch red-billed queleas. Trappers belonging to the Hadjerai tribe use triangular hand-held nets, which are both selective and efficient. Each team of six trappers caught about twenty thousand birds each night. An estimated five to ten million queleas are trapped near N'Djamena each year, representing a market value of approximately US$37,500‚Äì75,000. Between 13 June and 21 August 1994 alone, 1.2 million queleas were caught. Birds were taken from roosts in the trees during the moonless period each night. The feathers were plucked and the carcasses fried the following morning, dried in the sun, and transported to the city to be sold on the market. The Sara people use standing fishing nets with a very fine mesh, while Masa and Musgum fishermen cast nets over groups of birds. The impact of hunting on the quelea population (about 200 million individuals in the Lake Chad Basin) is deemed insignificant. Woven traps made from star grass (Cynodon nlemfuensis) are used to catch hundreds of these birds daily in the Kondoa District, Tanzania. Guano is collected from under large roosts in Nigeria and used as a fertiliser. Tourists like to watch the large flocks of queleas, such as during visits of the Kruger National Park. The birds themselves eat pest insects such as migratory locusts, and the moth species Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera exempta. The animal's large distribution and population resulted in a conservation status listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. === Aviculture === The red-billed quelea is sometimes kept and bred in captivity by hobbyists. It thrives if kept in large and high cages, with space to fly to minimise the risk of obesity. A sociable bird, the red-billed quelea tolerates mixed-species aviaries. Keeping many individuals mimics its natural occurrence in large flocks. This species withstands frosts, but requires shelter from rain and wind. Affixing hanging branches, such as hawthorn, in the cage facilitates nesting. Adults are typically given a diet of tropical seeds enriched with grass seeds, augmented by living insects such as mealworms, spiders, or boiled shredded egg during the breeding season. Fine stone grit and calcium sources, such as shell grit and cuttlebone, provide nutrients as well. If provided with material like fresh grass or coconut fibre they can be bred. === Pest management === Sometimes called \\"Africa's feathered locust\\", the red-billed quelea is considered a serious agricultural pest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The governments of Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, Sudan, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe have regularly made attempts to lessen quelea populations. The most common method to kill members of problematic flocks was by spraying the organophosphate avicide fenthion from the air on breeding colonies and roosts. In Botswana and Zimbabwe, spraying was also executed from ground vehicles and manually. Kenya and South Africa regularly used fire-bombs. Attempts during the 1950s and '60s to eradicate populations, at least regionally, failed. Consequently, management is at present directed at removing those congregations that are likely to attack vulnerable fields. == References == == External links == * * Category:Agricultural pests red- billed quelea red-billed quelea Category:Birds of Sub-Saharan Africa red- billed quelea ","title":"Red-billed quelea"},{"id":"1437124","text":"Socialist society may refer to one of the following. *A society based on socialism, inclusive collaborative decision-making *The societies of the Communist states *Socialist Society, a periodical *Socialist society (Labour Party) ","title":"Socialist society"},{"id":"1437141","text":"Heinrich Friedrich Link Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link (2 February 1767 ‚Äì 1 January 1851) was a German naturalist and botanist. ==Biography== Link was born at Hildesheim as a son of the minister August Heinrich Link (1738‚Äì1783), who taught him love of nature through collection of 'natural objects'. He studied medicine and natural sciences at the Hannoverschen Landesuniversit√§t of G√∂ttingen, and graduated as MD in 1789, promoting on his thesis \\"Flora der Felsgesteine rund um G√∂ttingen\\" (Flora of the rocky beds around G√∂ttingen). One of his teachers was the famous natural scientist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752‚Äì1840). He became a private tutor (Privatdozent) in G√∂ttingen. In 1792 he became the first professor of the new department of chemistry, zoology and botany at the University of Rostock. During his stay at Rostock, he became an early follower of the antiphlogistic theory of Lavoisier, teaching about the existence of oxygen instead of phlogiston. He was also a proponent of the attempts of Richter to involve mathematics in chemistry, introducing stoichiometry in his chemistry lessons. In 1806 he set up the first chemical laboratory at Rostock in the \\"Seminargeb√§ude\\". He began to write an abundant number of articles and books on the most different subjects, such as physics and chemistry, geology and mineralogy, botany and zoology, natural philosophy and ethics, prehistoric and early history. He was twice elected rector of the university. In 1793 he married Charlotte Juliane Josephi (1768?‚Äì1829), sister of his colleague at the university Prof. Wilhelm Josephi (1763‚Äì1845). During 1797‚Äì1799 he visited Portugal with Count Johann Centurius Hoffmannsegg, a botanist, entomologist and ornithologist from Dresden. This trip made him finally choose botany as his main scientific calling. In 1800 he was elected to the prestigious Leopoldina Academy, the oldest school for natural history in Europe. In 1808 he was awarded a prize at the Academy of Saint Petersburg for his monography Von der Natur und den Eigenschaften des Lichts (nature and characteristics of light). His scientific reputation grew and became widely known. In 1811 he was appointed professor of chemistry and botany at Breslau university, where he was equally elected twice rector of the university. After the death of Carl Ludwig Willdenow in 1815, he became professor of natural history, curator of the herbarium and director of the botanic garden (Hortus regius Berolinensis) in Berlin until he died. This period became the most fruitful period of his academic life. He augmented the collection of the garden to 14,000 specimens, many of them rare plants. He worked in close collaboration with Cristoph Friedrich Otto (1783‚Äì1856), conservator at the botanical garden. In 1827 he named with him the cacti genera Echinocactus and Melocactus. Most of the fungi that he named, are still recognised under the original name, proving the high quality of his work (such as Cordyceps, Creopus, Fusarium, Leocarpus, Myxomycetes, Phragmidium). He was elected member of the Berlin Academy of Science and many other scientific societies, including the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which elected him a foreign member in 1840. He trained a whole new generation of natural scientists, such as Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg (1795‚Äì1876). Throughout his life, he travelled extensively throughout Europe. He benefited from his knowledge of foreign languages, including Arabic and ancient Sanskrit. He died in Berlin on 1 January 1851, almost 84 years old. He was succeeded by Alexander Heinrich Braun (1805‚Äì1877), Title page of Filicum species in horto regio Berolinensi cultae He is recognised as one of the last scientists of the 19th century with a universal knowledge. Link was also one of the few German botanists of his time, who aimed at a complete understanding of plants, through a systematic anatomical and physiological research.

Initially, the process was used on earthenware. By the 15th century, small pottery towns of the Westerwald, including H√∂hr-Grenzhausen, Siegberg, K√∂ln, and Raeren in Flanders, were producing a salt-glazed stoneware,G.C.Nelson.

In the 17th century, salt glaze gained popularity in England as well as in Colonial America. Westerwald Pottery was characterized by stamped medallions and the use of a cobalt oxide based colorant for decoration. Production of salt glaze pottery in Westerwald ceased because of environmental considerations in 1983. In the UK during the 17th century and 18th century, high quality salt-glazed stoneware was produced in Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, London and Staffordshire. Salt glazed pottery was also popular in North America from the early 17th century until the early 19th century,'Salt-glazed Stoneware in Early America.' J.E.Skerry, S.Findlen Hood. University Press of New England & Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. 2009 indeed it was the dominant domestic pottery there during the 19th century. Whilst its manufacturer in America increased from the earliest dated production, the 1720s in Yorktown, significant amounts were always imported from Britain.'A Guide To Artifacts Of Colonial America.' I.N.Hume. University of Pennsylvania Press. 2001. One of the first potteries in America was on Bean Hill in Norwich, Connecticut. They manufactured yellow-brown, salt glazed earthenware. Their salt glaze technique was discovered in about 1680 by a servant. There was an earthen vessel on the fire with brine in it to cure salt pork. While the servant was away the brine boiled over, the pot became red hot, and the sides were found to be glazed. A local potter utilized the discovery and the salt glaze technique became an established fact. During the 20th century, the technique was promoted for studio pottery use by Bernard Leach. In the 1950s, it was introduced into Japanese craft pottery through Leach's association with Sh≈çji Hamada. Don Reitz introduced salt glazing into the curriculum at Alfred University in New York in 1959, and it subsequently spread to other American universities with ceramic art programs. Due to concerns of significant amount of air pollution resulting from the process environmental clean air restrictions led to the demise of widespread use of salt glazing. It was last used on any large scale for the production of salt- glazed sewer-pipes, and other than limited use by some studio potters the process is obsolete, although there are reports of it still being used for sewer-pipes in India. ===English salt glaze stoneware=== Experiments in stoneware production began in England during the second part of the 17th century. The earliest evidence has been dated 1650‚Äì1700 at the site of a kiln at Woolwich Ferry, London. The similarity of the ware to German products of a similar era has led it to be attributed to immigrant potters. A significant English manufacturer of salt glaze pottery was John Dwight at the Fulham Pottery, which he founded in 1672.'John Dwight's Fulham Pottery, 1672-1978: A Collection of Documentary Sources.' D.Haselgrove & J.Murray. Journal of Ceramic History 11 (1979).'John Dwight.' M.Bimson. Transactions of the English Ceramic Circle 5, no.2 (1961) In a related patent application, which was granted in 1671, he also claimed to have \\"discovered the mystery of transparent earthenware commonly knowne by the name of porcelaine or China and Persian ware.\\" By the 1800s Lambeth in London had become a centre for the production of salt glaze stoneware, and most especially after the establishment of Doulton and Watts Pottery, which later became Royal Doulton. The company was founded in 1815 when John Doulton formed a partnership with the owner, Martha Jones and foreman, John Watts, of an existing pottery in Lambeth. Initially the factory specialised in utilitarian salt glazed stoneware, similar to that produced by the Fulham factories. During the 1830s and 1840s, considerable amounts of salt-glazed sewer-pipes were produced by Doultons following Sir Edwin Chadwick's advocacy of improved sanitary conditions. Doultons were also one of the earliest manufacturers of electrical insulators, initially using salt glaze stoneware and for the electrical telegraph systems. Also, from about 1830, they started production of salt glaze stoneware vessels, which were valued for their acid resistance, for the emerging chemical industries. From the 1850s Doulton & Co.'s decorative stoneware, that was produced in association with the nearby Lambeth School of Art, enjoyed significant success at various international exhibitions, including at The Great Exhibition in 1851, Philadelphia Exhibition in 1876, and also at Chicago in 1893. Their salt glaze decorative products became known as 'Doulton Ware'. By 1890 their decorative stoneware were so successful that 350 designers and artists were employed at the Lambeth factory, including the famous George Tinworth.Royal Doulton, McKeown J. Shire Publications Ltd. 2004. Doulton‚Äôs Lambeth factory closed in 1956, due largely to new clean air regulations that prohibited the production of salt glaze in the urban environment. Production, but not of salt glazing, was transferred to their factory in Burslem which had been established in 1877. Several other stoneware potteries also operated in Lambeth between the mid-18th & 19th centuries, including James Stiff and Sons and Stephen Green's Imperial pottery. The former having started his pottery career at Doulton in 1830, before opening his own factory in 1843. Except for its use by a few studio potters, the process is obsolete. Before its demise, in the face of environmental clean air restrictions, it was last used in the production of salt-glazed sewer- pipes.'Dictionary of Ceramics' 3rd ed. A.Dodd, D.Murfin.

The only commercial pottery in the UK currently licensed to produce salt glaze pottery is Errington Reay at Bardon Mill in Northumberland which was founded in 1878. ===New world=== One of the first potteries in America was on Bean Hill in Norwich, Connecticut. They manufactured yellow-brown, salt glazed earthenware. Their salt glaze technique was discovered in about 1680 by a servant. There was an earthen vessel on the fire with brine in it to cure salt pork. While the servant was away the brine boiled over, the pot became red hot, and the sides were found to be glazed. A local potter utilized the discovery and the salt-glaze became an established fact. The earliest known production of salt glaze pottery in Australia has been dated to 1850‚Äì1883. ==Process== Pouring salt into a wood- fired kiln, using a carved-out piece of bamboo filled with salt soaked in water. Modern salt-glazed porcelain piece The salt glaze is formed on the unglazed body by reaction of common salt with the clay body constituents, particularly silica, toward the end of firing. The body should ideally be richer in silica than normal stoneware, and iron impurities can help produce good salt glazes. A reduction atmosphere can be employed as the reduced iron silicates are very powerful fluxes. The salting mixture of sodium chloride and water is introduced into the kiln when the appropriate temperature is reached, typically around 900 ¬∞C. As the kiln reaches higher temperatures, typically 1100‚Äì1200 ¬∞C, the sodium chloride vaporizes and reacts with steam to form hydrogen chloride and soda. These vapors react with the silica in the body and other body constituents. A glaze of fairly high alumina content (0.6 molecular parts) and a relatively low silica content (2.6 molecular parts), and in which the main base is soda, is formed. Salt glazes have been improved by the addition of borax, and sometimes sodium nitrate, to the salting mixture. Colouring oxides can be incorporated in the salting mixture to give decorative effects, such as a kind of aventurine glaze.Rado, P. An Introduction to the Technology Of Pottery. 2nd edition. Pergamon Press, 1988. Salt fumes in a firing atmosphere react in the following way: :2NaCl + 2H2O ‚Üí 2NaOH + 2HCl :2NaOH ‚Üí Na2O + H2O In soda firings the reaction is a little more direct, not requiring the presence of water vapor: :Na2CO3 ‚Üí Na2O + CO2 Both the hydrogen chloride and the carbon dioxide are gases; they do not react with the sodium oxide that binds with the silica and other components of the clay body. Hydrogen chloride leaving the kiln will form a hydrochloric acid vapour on contact with moisture in the air or kiln exhaust gases. Any remaining sodium oxide will form salt by reacting with hydrochloric acid vapour as the gases exit the kiln. The sodium oxide (Na2O) reacts with the alumina and silica in the clay body to form a sodium alumino-silicate glaze. The general reaction is shown below, with the values for x and y varying dependent on the amounts of sodium oxide, alumina and silica composing the glaze: :Na2O + SiO2 \\\\+ Al2O3¬∑(SiO2)2 ‚Üí (Na2O)x¬∑Al2O3¬∑(SiO2)y Salt can also be used as a decorative element on selected individual pots. Biscuit ware can be soaked in a brine solution to create salted patterns. Rope and other textiles can also be soaked in brine and wrapped around biscuit ware. Salt can also be added, in solution, to coloured clay slips and can be sprinkled onto biscuit ware in protective, ceramic containers called saggars. A related technique, soda firing, substitutes soda ash and/or sodium bicarbonate for common salt. Whilst the application method is a little different, the alternatives need to be sprayed into the kiln, results are similar to salt glazing but for subtle differences in texture and colour. ==References== ==Further reading== *Rogers, Phil.

In this design the Displacer piston is used without a regenerator. The rhombic drive is a specific method of transferring mechanical energy, or work, used when a single cylinder is used for two separately oscillating pistons. ==History== It was originally developed around 1900 for the twin-cylinder Lanchester car engine where it allowed perfect balancing of the inertial forces on both pistons. A current example of its use is on beta type-Stirling engines; the drive's complexity and tight tolerances, causing a high cost of manufacture, is a hurdle for the widespread usage of this drive. ==Operation== Schematic of a rhombic drive stirling engine in operation. In its simplest form, the drive utilizes a jointed rhomboid to convert linear work from a reciprocating piston to rotational work. The connecting rod of the piston is rigid as opposed to a common reciprocating engine which directly connects the piston to the crankshaft with a flexible joint in the piston. Instead, the rod connects to one corner of a rhombus. When force is applied to the piston, it pushes down; at the same time, the outer corners of the rhomboid push out. They push on two cranks/flywheels which cause them to rotate, each in opposite directions. As the wheels rotate the rhombus progresses its change of shape from being flattened in the direction of the piston axis at top dead centre to being flattened in the perpendicular direction to the piston axis at bottom dead centre. In the pictured example the left crank/flywheel turns clockwise and the right crank/flywheel anticlockwise. They turn at the same angular velocity and this can be reinforced by intermeshing them as gear wheels. ==References== * Mechanical Drives for Stirling Engines Dr. Siegfried \\"Zig\\" Herzog, Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Penn State University at Mont Alto. 06/01/05 Accessed August 2007 ==See also== Category:Piston engines Category:Engine technology Category:Linkages (mechanical) ","title":"Rhombic drive"},{"id":"1437174","text":"Stephen Andrew Perkins (September 13, 1967) is an American musician and songwriter.

Initially a teacher, he left his career in education in 1921 to pursue writing. He wrote poems, novels (ranging from realism to science fiction), as well as children‚Äôs literature. ==Childhood and adolescence== P√©rochon was born 24 February 1885 in Courlay, Deux-S√®vres at Tyran Farm. He was raised as a Protestant in a region with an unusual religious make-up, living alongside both Royalist Catholic \\"chouans\\" from the Vend√©e and dissidents from \\"the little church\\" which had refused the authority of the 1801 Concordat signed by Napoleon and Pope Pius VII. P√©rochon was very attached to his home region and to family values. He described in his stories his love for the common people, \\"les cherche-pain\\" (bread seekers) in his home region of the G√¢tine at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1897, P√©rochon became a student at l‚ÄôEcole Primaire Sup√©rieure in Bressuire, eleven kilometers north of Courlay. ==Adulthood== In 1900, P√©rochon enrolled at l‚ÄôEcole Normale in Parthenay (35 kilometers southeast of Courlay), and he later became an assistant primary teacher at Courlay before becoming a teacher at l‚ÄôEcole Primaire Sup√©rieure in Parthenay. He served in the military in 1905 under the 114th Infantry Regiment in Saint-Maixent. In 1907, P√©rochon married Vanda Houmeau, who was also a teacher. He then moved to Saint-Paul-en-G√¢tine where his only daughter, Simone, was born in 1908. In 1908, his first work was published by Clouzot in Niort. In 1909, he was published for a second time and his first novel, Les creux de maisons, in which he evoked the image of \\"les cherche-pain,\\" was also serialized in the newspaper l‚ÄôHumanit√© in this year. In 2012, P√©rochon's 1925 science fiction novel Les Hommes Fr√©n√©tiques was translated by Brian Stableford as The Frenetic People. ==Death== In 1914, P√©rochon returned to teaching in Vouill√©. After being called up to the army, he suffered a heart attack on the front lines. In 1920, his novel N√™ne, published by Clouzot, earned him the Prix Goncourt. The following year, he retired from teaching for good and moved to Niort. In 1940, P√©rochon refused to collaborate with the Vichy press and two of his novels were banned. He was threatened by the Vichy Prefect, and the Gestapo watched him closely. He concealed his anxiety from his family. He died February 10, 1942 from another heart attack at age 57. ==Anecdote== In 1935, P√©rochon's daughter, Simone, married Delphin Debenest, who was also involved in the Resistance during World War II. A soldier in 1940, this intelligence agent in the Franco-Belgian Resistance was arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Buchenwald and then to Kommando in Holzen from which he succeeded in escaping. During the Nuremberg Trials, this extraordinary man acted as deputy prosecutor. He was also a magistrate in Niort and Poitiers and won numerous French and Belgian military decorations. == Novels (selected) == Les Creux-De-Maisons (1912) Les hommes fr√©n√©tiques (1925) (translated in 2012 by Brian Stableford as \\"The Frenetic People\\") N√™ne (1920) - Prix Goncourt (translated in 1922) Le Chemin de plaine (1920) La Parcelle 32 (1922) (translated in 1923 by Frances C.

Under the High Patronage of the Minister of National Education and Culture, numerous speeches were given, including one by Mr. Leblond-Zola, grandson of √âmile Zola. For this occasion, a classroom from the time when P√©rochon was a student (and later a teacher) at Tour Nivelle was reconstructed. People have visited this place from then on, and it can still be visited today. This marked the beginning of the year of P√©rochon which was celebrated with many cultural events in the Deux-S√®vres as well as with shows and displays relating to the works of P√©rochon such as \\"l‚Äôhomme fr√©n√©tique\\" (The Frenzied Man), \\"les creux de maisons,\\" and \\"les gardiennes\\" (The Caretakers).

Quarries for trap rock were operated in the area from 1841 to 1896, leading to the community's name being changed first to Granite Village, then Graniteville. According to College of Staten Island professor, geologist Alan Benimoff, this name is a misnomer, as the quarry actually contained no granite. Granite is made of potassium feldspar. The rock at the quarry is composed of sodium feldspar. Also, professor Benimoff discovered Trondhjemite at the site, a rare mineral.Staten Island news article. Graniteville Quarry Park: A Unique Geological Area Transformed From Dumping Ground To City Park - Interviews With CSI Professor of Geology Alan Benimoff and The Friends of Graniteville Quarry Park Co-Founder Kathy Romanelli Largely rural well into the 20th century, Graniteville was the scene of a notable fire in March 1942, when an explosion at the Consolidated Fireworks Company on Richmond Avenue claimed the lives of five employees. Bisected from east to west by the Staten Island Expressway and with New York State Route 440 forming its eastern boundary, Graniteville's most notable landmark is Baron Hirsch Cemetery, an 80-acre (324,000 m¬≤) Jewish cemetery founded in the late 19th century and still in active use; in August 2001 this cemetery became the focus of a local health-related story when it was one of six locations on the island where mosquitos carrying the West Nile virus were discovered. Residential development in the area burgeoned soon after the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge opened in November 1964, and today Graniteville stands at the north end of a busy commercial strip along Richmond Avenue; this strip, which extends to the vicinity of the Staten Island Mall approximately 4 miles (6 km) away, is the scene of some of the heaviest automotive traffic on Staten Island. ==Demographics== As of the 2010 census, the demographics of Graniteville were roughly as follows: 37.4% White, 16.6% Black, 29.9% Hispanic, 13.1% Asian, 3% Other. This is defining Graniteville as everything within the boundaries of Census Tracts 303.01 & 303.02. ==Education== Public school students in Graniteville are mostly zoned for P.S.60 and P.S.22, and I.S.51 (Markham Intermediate School) or I.S.72 (Rocco Laurie Intermediate School), as well as Port Richmond High School. The John W. Lavelle Preparatory Charter School opened in September 2009 and is the first charter school (a school that is publicly funded, but privately run) on Staten Island. Also, a new school called The Staten Island School of Civic Leadership (P.S./I.S. 861) opened in September. This is Staten Island's first K to 8 school. Residents don't have a library in the community and use the Port Richmond, Todt Hill-Westerleigh, and Mariners Harbor branches of the New York Public Library. ==Transportation== Graniteville is served by the S48, S98, SIM30, SIM33, SIM34 and SIM35 on Forest Avenue, the S40, S46, S48, S90, S96, S98, SIM33 and SIM34 on South Avenue, and the S44, S59, S89, S94, SIM3, SIM4, SIM8, and SIM8X on Richmond Avenue. ==Police and crime== Graniteville and the West Shore are patrolled by the 121st Precinct of the NYPD, located at 970 Richmond Avenue. The 121st Precinct was split from the 120th Precinct in 2013; the latter ranked 12th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010.

Bush and UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the early 1990s, purporting to describe the economic benefit of a decrease in defense spending. It is used primarily in discussions relating to the guns versus butter theory. The term was frequently used at the end of the Cold War, when many Western nations significantly cut military spending (such as Britain's Options for Change defence review). ==Validity== While economies do undergo a recession after the end of a major conflict as the economy is forced to adjust and retool, a \\"peace dividend\\" refers to a potential long-term benefit as budgets for defense spending are assumed to be at least partially redirected to social programs and/or a decrease in taxation rates. The existence of a peace dividend in real economies is still debated, but some research points to its reality.Sanjeev Gupta, Benedict Clements, Rina Bhattacharya, and Shamit Chakravarti (2002), \\"The Elusive Peace Dividend\\" at Finance & Development, a quarterly magazine of the IMF. A political discussion about the peace dividend resulting from the end of the Cold War involves a debate about which countries have actually scaled back military spending and which have not. The scale back in defense spending was mainly noticeable in Western Europe and in the Russian Federation. The United States, whose military spending was rapidly reducing between 1985 and 1993 and remained flat between 1993 and 1999, has dramatically increased it after September 11, 2001 to fund conflicts like the War on Terror, the War in Afghanistan and the War in Iraq. ==Other uses== \\"Peace dividend\\" can also refer to the improved economy in Northern Ireland after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. ==See also== *Have one's cake and eat it too *Opportunity cost *Scarcity *Tax choice *There ain't no such thing as a free lunch *Trade-off ==Notes== Category:Political economy Category:Peace Category:Military economics ","title":"Peace dividend"},{"id":"1437184","text":"The production possibilities frontier (PPF) for guns versus butter. Points like X that are outside the PPF are impossible to achieve. Points such as B, C, and D illustrate the trade-off between guns and butter: at these levels of production, producing more of one requires producing less of the other. Points located along the PPF curve represent sustainable combinations of each type of production in a world where scarcity is a binding constrain. A, however, is inside of the PPF and represents a combination of output that is not utilizing all available resources. In macroeconomics, the guns versus butter model is an example of a simple production‚Äìpossibility frontier. It demonstrates the relationship between a nation's investment in defense and civilian goods. The \\"guns or butter\\" model is used generally as a simplification of national spending as a part of GDP. This may be seen as an analogy for choices between defense and civilian spending in more complex economies. The nation will have to decide which balance of guns versus butter best fulfills its needs, with its choice being partly influenced by the military spending and military stance of potential opponents. Researchers in political economy have viewed the trade-off between military and consumer spending as a useful predictor of election success. In this example, a nation has to choose between two options when spending its finite resources. It may buy either guns (invest in defense/military) or butter (invest in production of goods), or a combination of both. == Origin of the term == One theory on the origin of the concept comes from William Jennings Bryan's resignation as United States Secretary of State in the Wilson Administration. At the outbreak of World War I, the leading global exporter of nitrates for gunpowder was Chile. Chile had maintained neutrality during the war and provided nearly all of the US's nitrate requirements. It was also the principal ingredient of chemical fertilizer in farming. The export product was sodium nitrate, a salt mined in the northern part of Chile which is often called Chilean saltpeter. With substantial popular opinion running against US entry into the war, the Bryan resignation and peace campaign (joined prominently with Henry Ford's efforts) became a banner for local versus national interests. However, Bryan was no more pro-German than the infamously nativistic Wilson; his motivation, instead, was to expose and publicize what he considered to be an unconscionable public policy. The National Defense Act of 1916 directed the president to select a site for the artificial production of nitrates within the United States. It was not until September 1917, several months after the United States entered World War I, that Wilson selected Muscle Shoals, Alabama, after more than a year of competition among political rivals. A deadlock in the Congress was broken when South Carolina Senator Ellison D. Smith sponsored the National Defense Act of 1916 that directed \\"the Secretary of Agriculture to manufacture nitrates for fertilizers in peace and munitions in war at water power sites designated by the President\\". This was presented by the news media as \\"guns and butter.\\" ==Significance== \\"Butter\\" represents nonsecurity goods that increase social welfare, such as schools, hospitals, parks, and roads. \\"Guns\\" refer to security goods such as personnel--both troops and civilian support staff--as well as military equipment like weapons, ships, or tanks. Because these two types of goods represent a tradeoff, a country cannot increase one without negatively impacting the other. States often attempt to share the burden of defense through alliances. This allows a state to reduce its own production of guns and shift resources towards social goods. If armed conflict is avoided, then expenditure on guns represents deadweight, or resources that could have been better spent on butter. In the case of war, however, the production‚Äìpossibility frontier shrinks through the loss of life and infrastructure. This, in turn, limits the ability of the state to produce social goods, and the ability of society to benefit from them. == Quoted use of the term == Perhaps the best known use of the phrase (in translation) was in Nazi Germany. In a speech on January 17, 1936, Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels stated: \\"We can do without butter, but, despite all our love of peace, not without arms. One cannot shoot with butter, but with guns.\\" Referencing the same concept, sometime in the summer of the same year another Nazi official, Hermann G√∂ring, announced in a speech: \\"Guns will make us powerful; butter will only make us fat.\\" US President Lyndon B. Johnson used the phrase to catch the attention of the national media while reporting on the state of national defense and the economy. Another use of the phrase was British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's statement, in a 1976 speech she gave at a Kensington Town Hall, in which she said, \\"The Soviets put guns over butter, but we put almost everything over guns.\\"Speech at Kensington Town Hall (\\"Britain Awake\\"), Margaret Thatcher Foundation The song \\"Guns Before Butter\\" by Gang of Four from their 1979 album Entertainment! is about this concept. The Prodigy's 1997 album The Fat of the Land has the following text on the fold-out booklet: \\"We have no butter, but I ask you /Would you rather have butter or guns? /Shall we import lard or steel? Let me tell you /Preparedness makes us powerful. /Butter merely makes us fat.\\" This phrase as the title for an episode (\\"Guns Not Butter\\") in season four of the television show The West Wing (1999‚Äì2006) that focused on the portion of the federal budget devoted to foreign aid. The concept was also discussed in the 2001 movie Baby Boy. NYC based rap group Flatbush Zombies reference the concept in their song ‚ÄúRegular and Complex (GNB) by sampling dialogue delivered by Ving Rhames from the film Baby Boy, in which guns are identified as things that ‚Äúappreciate with value‚Äù such as real estate or stocks and bonds, while butter as identified as cars, and jewelry, and other things that ‚Äúdon‚Äôt mean shit after you buy it.‚Äù The concept is referenced in the title of the song \\"Gunz n Butter\\" on A$AP Rocky's 2018 album Testing. == Great Society example == Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society programs in the 1960s, when he was President of the United States, are examples of the guns versus butter model. While Johnson wanted to continue New Deal programs and expand welfare with his own Great Society programs, he was also involved in both the arms race of the Cold War and in the Vietnam War. These wars put strains on the economy and hampered his Great Society programs. This is in stark contrast to President Dwight D Eisenhower's own objections to the expansion and endless warfare of the military-industrial complex. In his \\"Chance For Peace\\" speech in 1953, he referred to this very trade-off, giving specific examples: > Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired > signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not > fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not > spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius > of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy > bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two > electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two > fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. > We pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat. We > pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than > 8,000 people. This is, I repeat, the best way of life to be found on the > road the world has been taking. This is not a way of life at all, in any > true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from > a cross of iron. ...

Barong tagalog combines elements from both the precolonial native Filipino and colonial Spanish clothing styles. It is traditionally made with sheer textiles (nipis) woven from pi√±a or abac√°; although in modern times, cheaper materials like silk, ramie, or polyester are also used. It is a common formal or semi-formal attire in Filipino culture, and is worn untucked over an undershirt with belted trousers and dress shoes. Baro't saya is the feminine equivalent of barong tagalog, with the Maria Clara gown being the formal variant of the latter.Moreno, Jose \\"Pitoy\\". - Maria Clara, Philippine Costume, koleksyon.com, archived from the original on July 13, 2006. Barong tagalog was also known as camisa fuera (\\"outer shirt\\") in Spanish. ==Etymology== The term \\"barong tagalog\\" is usually shortened in modern Filipino to \\"barong\\", though it is grammatically incorrect as barong is not a word that can stand alone. It contains the enclitic suffix -ng which indicates that it is modified by or modifies the next word. The root word of barong is the Tagalog word baro, meaning \\"outfit\\" or \\"clothing\\". The term is usually not capitalized. Though \\"barong tagalog\\" literally translates to \\"Tagalog outfit\\", the \\"tagalog\\" in the name does not mean that it was a form of dress exclusive to the Tagalog people, as opposed to other Philippine ethnic groups. Barong tagalog (and baro't saya) were worn universally among Christianized lowlanders throughout the Philippines in the Spanish colonial period. Rather, the name was coined to distinguish the dress as native (hence \\"tagalog\\", i.e. indio), as opposed to the styles of dress of Europeans and other foreign cultures. ==Description== Barong tagalog worn with a salakot. The woman is wearing a terno. Barong tagalog is a formal shirt usually made of sheer lightweight but stiff fabric known as nipis (usually woven from pi√±a or abac√° fibers). When using sheer fabrics, it is worn over an undershirt known as the camis√≥n or camiseta, which can have short or long sleeves. The term camisa de chino is also used for collar-less and cuff-less shirts, named after its resemblance to shirts worn by Chinese laborers. It is worn with belted trousers and dress shoes. Headgear, when worn, is either a salakot or a buntal hat (and historically also top hats or bowler hats). The ensemble mixes elements of both native and Spanish traditions. Dancers in barong tagalog (with a buntal hat) and traje de mestiza performing Jota Cagayana Barong tagalog can vary considerably in terms of design and material used, but they share common characteristics of having long sleeves, embroidery, being buttoned (halfway or straight down the chest), and the absence of pockets. They are also worn loosely and have slits on both sides. Historically, the material used for barong tagalog depended on the social class of the wearer and the formality of the occasion. Barong tagalog made of fine, sheer material like nipis were worn largely by the upper classes or were used for festive occasions; while barong tagalog made of cheaper opaque materials like cotton or sinamay were used by lower classes or for daily wear. The quality of the material and the intricacy of the embroidery were often signs of the status and wealth of the wearer. The embroidery of the barong tagalog are commonly placed on a rectangular section on the front of the chest (known as pechera, \\"shirt front\\", from Spanish pecho, \\"chest\\"), and/or over the entire shirt (sabog, from Tagalog for \\"scattered\\"). They feature various embroidery techniques, including calado and doble calado (\\"pierced\\" and \\"double-pierced\\", types of openwork drawn thread embroidery), encajes de bolilio (Venetian lace), and sombrado (shadow embroidery). They can also have other kinds of ornamentation, like alforza (pleats), suksuk (weft floats), and even hand- painted designs. Occasionally feminized versions are worn by women, either as an egalitarian or haute couture fashion statement; or as a form of power dressing when worn by female politicians (such as Corazon Aquino during her presidency). However, the direct female counterpart of the barong tagalog is the baro't saya (or more formal versions of it like the traje de mestiza and the terno), and both share the same precolonial origins. ==History== ===Pre- colonial era=== Tagalog maginoo (nobility) wearing baro in the Boxer Codex (c.1590) The barong tagalog originated from the Tagalog baro (literally \\"shirt\\" or \\"clothing\\", also known as bar√∫ or bay√∫ in other Philippine languages), a simple collar-less shirt or jacket with close-fitting long sleeves worn by both men and women in most ethnic groups in the pre-colonial Philippines. These were made from rough linen-like cloth woven from native abac√° fiber, or from imported fabrics woven from silk, cotton, and kapok, among others. This type of shirt was known by the Spanish as the canga or chamerreta. Among Tagalog men, they were commonly paired with a rectangle of richly decorated cloth known as the salaual or salawal worn knee-length and drawn up in the middle; while in women they were paired with a wraparound skirt known as the tapis. The baro usually extend to just slightly below the waist. However, in the Visayas, aside from similar baro (which had shorter sleeves) and salaual combinations, men also wore colorful robe-like and coat- like variants that could extend to well below the knees (known as the marlota and baquero in Spanish, respectively). These were sometimes belted at the waist. Among Tagalogs, red dyes and gold trimmings were indicative of being a member of nobility (maginoo) or the warrior caste (maharlika). The design of the original baro was influenced by trade and contact with neighboring regions, the most notable influence being the South Asian kurta. ===Spanish colonial era=== Full traditional Tagalog attire for working-class commoners during the Spanish colonial era, with barong tagalog, esclavina (rain capes), and salakot headwear (c.1855) Early records of clothing in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial era from the 16th to the 18th centuries were limited, thus the exact evolution of the precolonial baro to the modern barong tagalog can not be established with precision. Based on illustrations and written accounts, however, baro were still largely only worn by commoners during this period. They were mostly identical to precolonial baro and were made from opaque linen-like abac√° textiles, and thus lacked the collars, buttons, and embroidery of later baro styles. The couturier Jose \\"Pitoy\\" Moreno has hypothesized that this transitional style of shirt was the camisa de chino of later centuries, which makes it a precursor to the barong tagalog. Depictions of members of the principalia upper classes (including natives and mestizos) in the 18th century showed that they invariably wore European-style clothing. ruff collar depicted in El Mestiso by Justiniano Asuncion (c.1841) The first baro precursor to gain favor among the local and mestizo elites was the barong mahaba (literally \\"long baro\\") which became prominent starting from the 1820s. These were much longer than the modern barong tagalog, reaching down to slightly above the knees. They were also commonly striped with bold colors like blue, red, or green. However, they already displayed hallmarks of the modern barong tagalog, including being made of sheer nipis material, embroidery, long sleeves, and a loose silhouette with slits on both sides. However, they lacked buttons. Early examples of barong mahaba usually had high-standing collars or even Elizabethan-style ruffs with narrow cravats. Barong mahaba were generally worn with colorful straight-cut trousers with stripes, checkers, or plaid-like patterns (generally made from imported cambaya, rayadillo, and guing√≥n fabrics), top hats (sombrero de copa), and a type of embroidered velvet or leather slip-on shoes known as corchos. While barong mahaba were generally worn loose, they were sometimes fastened by silk strings through three openings around the waist, either over or under the shirt. The sheer fabric used by barong mahaba also necessitated the wearing of an undershirt, known as camis√≥n or camiseta, which was also worn on its own by commoners. By the 1840s, barong mahaba largely fell out of fashion. In this period, it evolved into the modern \\"classic\\" barong tagalog, being much shorter with less ostentatious folded collars, while still retaining the sheer fabric and other baro characteristics. They were also worn with smaller hats like bowler hats (sombrero hongo) or native buntal hats. They were initially paired with looser trousers, though they gradually assumed the dimensions of modern trousers by the end of the 19th century. The colors of the barong tagalog also became more muted and monochromatic, in contrast to the colorful barong mahaba ensembles of earlier decades. Barong tagalog ensembles from the mid-19th century onwards were usually combinations of black and white, blue and white, or all-white. Baro worn by commoners also favored darker colors like brown or blue, usually paired with white silk pants. A native Filipino in a late 19th-century dark-colored barong tagalog, from the collections of the Biblioteca Nacional de Madrid (c.1870) This type of barong tagalog were common among government workers and businessmen, who usually wore them underneath jackets (chaqueta). Sheer baro were also worn by natives and mestizos for fiestas, leisure activities like dancing, or for church. However, western- style suits became more popular among students of the burgeoning ilustrado educated class. A notable variant of the barong tagalog during this period was the baro cerrada (literally \\"closed baro\\"). Its name is derived from its closed-neck collar. It was made from opaque material (which can be white or darker colors) and was paired with white pants. This style of baro remained popular up until the early 1900s. A commonly repeated but false belief is that the Spanish colonizers made the natives wear their barong tagalog with the shirt tails hanging out to distinguish them from the ruling class; its translucent fabric allegedly showing that the wearer was not concealing a weapon underneath. There are no historical records of this anytime from the 16th to the late 19th century. No regulations mandated the use of sheer material or banned the tucking in of men's shirts. Baro were always worn untucked, even in the precolonial period; and up until the 19th century, they were not made from translucent nipis fabric. While the style and textiles worn by different classes did vary over the Spanish colonial period, this was due to fashion, wealth, and class distinction, rather than law. Most commoners throughout the colonial period wore baro made from cheaper and more durable opaque textiles, while expensive nipis fabrics were worn mostly by the upper classes. Natives (indios descended from precolonial nobility) and mestizos (both mestizos de Espa√±ol and mestizos de sangley) were also part of the aristocratic upper classes (principalia) and it wasn't restricted to Europeans. Indios and mestizos, regardless of class, wore barong tagalog and European-style clothing depending on what they can afford and which were fashionable at the time. The wearing of barong tagalog did have racial connotations however, since most people of unmixed European descent (the insulares, criollos, and peninsulares) retained their own dress styles and largely ignored native fashions. ===American colonial era=== Emilio Aguinaldo, in a baro cerrada, with his son (1906) The popularity of barong tagalog further waned during the American colonial period. It was replaced by suits (known as Americana in the Philippines) and tuxedos in most formal functions. In contrast, women persisted in wearing the native terno (a modernized and unified version of the baro't saya), which was then associated with suffragists. Barro cerrada remained popular as informal leisure clothing, however. A notable barong tagalog during this period was the \\"Commonwealth Barong Tagalog\\" worn by President Manuel L. Quezon, which featured embroidery of the flags of the Commonwealth of the Philippines and the United States. However, other than this, Quezon mostly wore American-style formal wear and did not promote the barong tagalog. ===Modern era=== Ramon Magsaysay and his (eventual) successor, Vice-President Carlos P. Garc√≠a, at their inauguration on 30 December 1953 After the Philippines independence on 4 July 1946, Americana or a suit and tie continued to be the dominant formal wear, worn by presidents Manuel Roxas and Elpidio Quirino. In 1953, however, President Ram√≥n Magsaysay won election by being \\"a man of the masses\\". He deliberately wore a barong tagalog at his inauguration. The press played up the symbolism of Magsaysay in a barong tagalog and the outgoing Quirino in a western-style suit as symbolic of the \\"break\\" between the independent Philippines and its colonial past. He also wore barong tagalog in most public and private state functions. Magsaysay's use of the barong tagalog as formal attire was unprecedented in modern times. His example was followed by other Philippine presidents, and by the time of Diosdado Macapagal's term in the 1960s, it had regained its status as formal wear. Ferdinand Marcos, in particular, wore barong tagalog at almost every occasion. In 1975, Marcos issued a decree for the barong tagalog, along with the baro't saya, to become the official national attire. June 5 to 11 was also declared as the \\"Barong Tagalog Week\\". Following Marcos' decree, barong tagalog became widely mandated as office wear for both employees of the government and private companies, as well as school uniforms. In the 1970s to the 1980s, companies like the Philippine Airlines, Ayala Corporation, and the Allied Bank were prescribing barong tagalog as their uniforms. Various semi-formal and informal versions of the barong tagalog developed during this period, including the short-sleeved polo barong and the linen barong. In 1998, Supreme Court Justice Hilario Davide, Jr. mandated the wearing of barong tagalog for all employees of the Judiciary of the Philippines. While the barong tagalog was now regarded as formal wear, it did not gain popularity as a wedding attire for grooms in the early post-war Philippines. Most weddings featured a groom in a western suit and a bride in a terno. However, by the 1990s, the situations had reversed. Grooms now almost always barong tagalog, while women favored western-style bridal gowns. ==Types of material used== Detail of the fabric and embroidery on a barong tagalog Typical organza barong tagalog worn at a wedding The finest barong tagalog are made from a variety of indigenous sheer fabrics (nipis). The most common traditional materials used are listed below. The fabrics used can also be composites of two different materials (like cotton and jusi or silk and pi√±a). Additionally, more informal barongs can also utilize common opaque textiles like cotton, linen, polyester, or ramie. * Pi√±a - a traditional sheer fabric hand-loomed from pineapple leaf fibers. It has a fine lustrous silk-like texture and has a natural yellowish tinge. It is the most expensive and highly prized material for barong tagalog, due to its manufacturing difficulty, quality, and rarity. It is characterized by fibers of uneven thickness which gives the fabric the appearance of having streaks. * Pi√±a seda - a traditional fabric created by interweaving pi√±a and silk (seda) fibers. It is usually less expensive than barong tagalog made purely from pi√±a, but is more expensive than other types of material. It is characterized by pi√±a fibers on the transverse weft, and silk fibers on the longitudinal warp. It is a lighter yellow color than barong tagalog made from pi√±a. * Jusi - a traditional sheer fabric hand-loomed from abaca fibers. It has a polished texture and a natural off-white color. It is less expensive than the pi√±a, but is still regarded as a classic material. It has a tendency to become brittle over time. It also commonly interweaves silk, cotton, or other fibers. It is sometimes misidentified as being made from \\"banana\\" fibers. From the 1960s onwards, most fabrics labeled as jusi are actually jusilyn and organza fabrics. These fabrics are not traditional, but are cheaper mechanically woven substitutes largely from China. * Pi√±a jusi - similar to pi√±a seda, it interweaves pi√±a fibers with jusi fibers. It is less expensive than pure pi√±a, but is more expensive than pure jusi. * Pinukpok - a traditional rough and opaque fabric made from abaca fibers. It is primarily a product of the Bicol Region. * Sinamay - a traditional opaque fabric made from loosely woven abaca fibers. It is cheaper than other abaca materials and has a coarse texture. * Jusilyn - a modern mechanically woven fabric made from silk or cotton and polyester, specifically made to resemble jusi fabric. It is less expensive than the jusi and is more opaque. Unlike pi√±a, it has fibers with an even texture and an off-white color, lacking the characteristic streaks of pi√±a or jusi. It can sometimes be chemically painted to give an appearance closer to traditional fabrics, and may even be sold off as counterfeit pi√±a or pi√±a seda fabrics. * Organza - a modern mechanically woven fabric made from silk or polyester from China. It has a polished and even texture, although it can be regarded as being too shiny. It is the cheapest material used for formal barong tagalog. ==Variations== The term barong tagalog is almost exclusively used to refer to the formal version of the barong. Named variants of the barong tagalog include the following: ===Historical=== Ferdinand Marcos (in a Pierre Cardin barong tagalog) with Imelda Marcos (in a terno) during the 1979 Clark Air Force Base turnover ceremonies *Barong mahaba (lit. \\"long baro\\"), is a type of barong tagalog popular in the early 19th century. They were much longer than modern barong tagalog, reaching to lengths just slightly above the knee. They were made of sheer material (commonly with longitudinal stripes) and were typically paired with straight-cut pants with striped patterns. They were normally worn loose, but they can sometimes be cinched at the waist. They featured a variety of collar styles, including Elizabethan-style ruffs. *Baro cerrada, also known as Americana cerrada, is a type of barong tagalog that became popular during the 1890s and the early American colonial period. The name means \\"closed shirt\\" and refers to its closed-neck collar. They were made of opaque material (which can be white or darker colors) and were usually worn with white pants. During the American period, they were worn as less formal everyday wear, as opposed to American-style suits. *Pinukpok was a longer coat-like version of barong tagalog from the mid-19th century. Its name (literally \\"beaten\\") comes from the fabric used, pinukpok, which were abac√° fibers manually pounded into strands before being woven into a rough opaque textile. They were worn by government officials like tenientes del barrio (village leaders) and gobernadorcillos (municipal governors) as overcoats. Today, the name is also applied to formal opaque barong tagalog with conventional cuts made from the same abac√° material. ===Modern=== *Pierre Cardin barong tagalog is a distinctive type of modern formal barong tagalog popularized by Ferdinand Marcos. It was created by fashion designer Jean Paul Gaultier of Pierre Cardin. It featured elements of fashion in the 1970s, including a tapering close-fitting cut, rigid oversized point collars (often characterized as an \\"Elvis Presley collar\\") and cuffs, and flared sleeves. It was also worn with flared pants. * Polo barong refers to a short-sleeved version of the barong, often made with linen, ramie or cotton. This is the least formal version of the barong and is frequently used as men's office wear (akin to the Western suit and tie). * Gus√≥t-mayaman and linen barong are barongs made with linen or linen-like fabrics (like ramie). The name, loosely translated, means \\"wrinkled [shirt] of the rich\\" and refers to their tendency to acquire paper-like creases when worn because of the material; as well as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the way the wrinkles are tolerated because of the comparatively high status of the wearer. These are generally considered less formal than the barong tagalog, and are also reserved for everyday office wear. * Shirt-jack barong are cut in shirt-jack style usually made of polyester-cotton, linen- cotton and the typical gus√≥t-mayaman fabrics. Popularised by politicians wearing this style during campaigns or field assignments, it gives the wearer a look that is somewhere between casual and dressed-up. This type of shirt is, however, considered inappropriate for very formal occasions such as weddings. ==Relation to the guayabera== The barong tagalog is a possible precursor to the guayabera, a shirt popular in Latin American communities since the late 19th century. It may have been introduced first to Mexico via the Manila- Acapulco Galleons and were adapted to use local fabrics in the absence of pi√±a or abac√°. A variant of the guayabera traditionally worn in Yucatan is still called \\"filipina.\\" ==Gallery== File:Spanish mestizo costume.jpgMestizos in the Philippines in barong tagalog and baro't saya by Jean Mallat de Bassilan (c.1846) File:El Cundiman by Jos√© Honorato Lozano.jpgEl Cundiman by Jos√© Honorato Lozano (c.1847), showing dancers in colorful striped barong tagalog and baro't saya File:Shirt MET 83.50.1 CP4.jpgStriped barong tagalog made from pi√±a in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (c.1850) File:Shirt MET 83.50.1 detail CP4.jpgDetail of the calado embroidery on the pechera of a pi√±a barong tagalog (c.1850) File:Governor Vilma Santos-Recto.jpgVilma Santos in a feminized version of the barong tagalog File:Barong Tagalog.JPGA barong tagalog placed against the light, showing the translucency of the fabric File:Philippine culture dance.jpgBaro't saya and barong tagalog worn by dancers of Cari√±osa File:MyBarong created this Custom tailored Barong Tagalog for my wedding.jpgModern jusi barong tagalog with a band collar ==See also== *Fashion and clothing in the Philippines *Manila shawl *Batik == References == Category:Philippine culture Category:National symbols of the Philippines Category:Culture of Batangas Category:Tops (clothing) Category:History of Asian clothing Category:Philippine clothing ","title":"Barong tagalog"},{"id":"1437204","text":"Wajig is a simplified wrapper to Debian's package management system dpkg/APT.

Their businesses, locally known as potbanks, fired their wares in distinctive bottle ovens. At the turn of the twentieth century over 4,000 of these were in use, although by 2014 only 47 survive, all of which are no longer in production but are listed buildings. The saggars were used for the biscuit and the glost firing. They were expected to last for about 40 firings; each potbank made their own in a saggar making workshop. Saggars were made from fireclay, by a saggar maker and two assistants: the framemaker and the bottom knocker. The framemaker beat the clay into a sheet on a metal table using a large mallet, the mow or mawl. Using a frame he would cut it to size, sprinkle it with sawdust and wrap it around a wooden block to make the walls. The framemaker was usually an apprentice in his late teens. The bottom knocker, usually a boy in his early teens, did the same on a smaller scale, constructing the round or banjo-shaped bottom. Again the mow was used to beat the air out of the clay and flatten the sheet. The saggar maker was an experienced craftsman who paid his assistants out of his piece-work earnings: he took the bottom and the sides onto a wheel and using his thumbs joined the sides to the bottom. The green saggars were dried and then placed on the top of bungs during the next firing of the kiln. The unfired ceramic ware was placed in saggars and then biscuit fired, before being glazed and again placed in saggars prior to being glost fired. Ware may then be decorated, and placed on refractory bats and fired again such as in a muffle kiln. A saggar maker's bottom knocker was a job title considered sufficiently amusing for it to be featured on the television panel show What's My Line?.Saggar making Whilst saggar making was a skilled craft, bottom knocking was far less skilled, consisting of beating clay into a metal ring.'Automatic Saggar Handling Plants'. Lippert J., GmBH & Co. Pressath, 1991 ==Studio pottery use== From the twentieth century studio potters have used saggars to create decorative ceramic pieces. In this use saggars are used to create a localised reducing atmosphere, or concentrate the effects of salts, metal oxides and other materials on the surface of their ware.Cort, Louise. Seto and Mino Ceramics. University of Hawaii Press, 1992, p. 68 Some pots may be carefully prepared for saggar firing. One method creates a smooth surface covered with clay slip, terra sigillata, which responds particularly well to the saggar technique. This slip covering may be burnished to achieve a gloss. Prepared pots are nestled into saggars filled with beds of combustible materials, such as sawdust, less combustible organic materials, salts and metals. These materials ignite or fume during firing, leaving the pot buried in layers of fine ash. Ware produced in filled saggars may display dramatic markings, with colours ranging from distinctive black and white markings to flashes of golds, greens and red tones. Porcelain and stoneware are ideal for displaying the surface patterns obtained through saggar firing. In addition to the use of saggars, some studio potters bundle pots and burnable materials within a heavy wrapping of metal foil. ==References== * Hamer, Frank and Janet.

Although any UN body can issue resolutions, in practice most resolutions are issued by the Security Council or the General Assembly. ==Legal status== Most expertse.g. Higgins (1994) p. 21 consider most General Assembly resolutions to be non-binding. Articles 10 and 14 of the UN Charter refer to General Assembly resolutions as \\"recommendations\\"; the recommendatory nature of General Assembly resolutions has repeatedly been stressed by the International Court of Justice.Sergei A. Voitovich, International Economic Organizations in the Internatio xczcnal Legal Process, p. 95. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1995. However, some General Assembly resolutions dealing with matters internal to the United Nations, such as budgetary decisions or instructions to lower-ranking organs, are clearly binding on their addressees. Under Article 25 of the Charter, UN member states are bound to carry out \\"decisions of the Security Council in accordance with the present Charter\\". Resolutions made under Chapter VII are considered binding, but resolutions under Chapter VI have no enforcement mechanisms and are generally considered to have no binding force under international law. In 1971, however, a majority of the then International Court of Justice (ICJ) members asserted in the non-binding Namibia advisory opinion that all UN Security Council resolutions are legally binding.Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970) , Advisory Opinion of 21 June 1971 at paragraphs 87-116, especially 113: \\"It has been contended that Article 25 of the Charter applies only to enforcement measures adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter. It is not possible to find in the Charter any support for this view. Article 25 is not confined to decisions in regard to enforcement action but applies to \\"the decisions of the Security Council\\" adopted in accordance with the Charter. Moreover, that Article is placed, not in Chapter VII, but immediately after Article 24 in that part of the Charter which deals with the functions and powers of the Security Council. If Article 25 had reference solely to decisions of the Security Council concerning enforcement action under Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter, that is to say, if it were only such decisions which had binding effect, then Article 25 would be superfluous, since this effect is secured by Articles 48 and 49 of the Charter.\\" This assertion by the ICJ has been countered by Erika De Wet and others.\\"The International Court of Justice took the position in the Namibia Advisory Opinion that Art. 25 of the Charter, according to which decisions of the Security Council have to be carried out, does not only apply in relation to chapter VII. Rather, the court is of the opinion that the language of a resolution should be carefully analysed before a conclusion can be drawn as to its binding effect. The Court even seems to assume that Art. 25 may have given special powers to the Security Council. The Court speaks of \\"the powers under Art. 25\\". It is very doubtful, however, whether this position can be upheld. As Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice has pointed out in his dissenting opinion: \\"If, under the relevant chapter or article of the Charter, the decision is not binding, Article [69/70] 25 cannot make it so. If the effect of that Article were automatically to make all decisions of the Security Council binding, then the words 'in accordance with the present Charter' would be quite superfluous\\". In practice the Security Council does not act on the understanding that its decisions outside chapter VII are binding on the States concerned. Indeed, as the wording of chapter VI clearly shows, non-binding recommendations are the general rule here.\\" Frowein, Jochen Abr. V√∂lkerrecht - Menschenrechte - Verfassungsfragen Deutschlands und Europas, Springer, 2004, , p. 58. De Wet argues that Chapter VI resolutions cannot be binding. Her reasoning, in part states: > Allowing the Security Council to adopt binding measures under Chapter VI > would undermine the structural division of competencies foreseen by Chapters > VI and VII, respectively. The whole aim of separating these chapters is to > distinguish between voluntary and binding measures. Whereas the specific > settlement of disputes provided by the former is underpinned by the consent > of the parties, binding measures in terms of Chapter VII are characterised > by the absence of such consent. A further indication of the non-binding > nature of measures taken in terms of Chapter VI is the obligation on members > of the Security Council who are parties to a dispute, to refrain from voting > when resolutions under Chapter VI are adopted. No similar obligation exists > with respect to binding resolutions adopted under Chapter VII... If one > applies this reasoning to the Namibia opinion, the decisive point is that > none of the Articles under Chapter VI facilitate the adoption of the type of > binding measures that were adopted by the Security Council in Resolution > 276(1970)... Resolution 260(1970) was indeed adopted in terms of Chapter > VII, even though the ICJ went to some length to give the opposite > impression.De Wet, Erika. The Chapter VII Powers of the United Nations > Security Council, Hart Publishing, 2004, , pp. 39-40. In practice, the Security Council does not consider its decisions outside Chapter VII to be binding. It has been proposed that a binding triad of conditions‚Äîa supermajority of the number of nations voting, whose populations and contributions in dues to the UN budget form a majority of the total‚Äîmake a General Assembly resolution binding on all nations; the proposal has gone nowhere. For more information on specific resolutions, see: * United Nations General Assembly Resolution * United Nations Security Council Resolution ==Structure of a resolution== United Nations resolutions follow a common format. Each resolution has three parts: the heading, the preambular clauses, and the operative clauses. The entire resolution consists of one long sentence, with commas and semi-colons throughout, and only one period at the very end. The heading contains the name of the body issuing the resolution (be it the Security Council, the General Assembly, a subsidiary organ of the GA, or any other resolution-issuing organization), which serves as the subject of the sentence; the preambular clauses (also called preambular phrases) indicating the framework through which the problem is viewed, as a preamble does in other documents; and the operative clauses (also called operative phrases) in which the body delineates the course of action it will take through a logical progression of sequentially numbered operative clauses (if it is the Security Council or a UN organ making policy for within the UN) or recommends to be taken (in many Security Council resolutions and for all other bodies when acting outside the UN). Each operative clause calls for a specific action. The last operative clause, at least in the Security Council, is almost always \\"Decides [or Resolves] to remain seized of the matter,\\" (sometimes changed to \\"actively seized\\"). The reasoning behind this custom is somewhat murky, but it appears to be an assurance that the body in question will consider the topic addressed in the resolution in the future if it is necessary. In the case of Security Council resolutions, it may well be employed with the hope of prohibiting the UNGA from calling an 'emergency special session' on any unresolved matters,US to UN: Butt out, GreenPeace.org, 10 April 2003 under the terms of the 'Uniting for Peace resolution', owing to the Charter stipulation in Article 12 that: \\"While the Security Council is exercising in respect of any dispute or situation the functions assigned to it in the present Charter, the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation.\\" The preambular and operative clauses almost always start with verbs, sometimes modified by adverbs then continue with whatever the body decides to put in; the first word is always either italicized or underlined. However, preambular clauses are unnumbered, end with commas, and sometimes do begin with adjectives; operative clauses are numbered, end with semicolons (except for the final one, which ends with a full stop/period), and never begin with adjectives. The name of the issuing body may be moved from above the preambular clauses to below them; the decision to do so is mostly stylistic, and the resolution still comprises a coherent sentence. ==Types== United Nations resolutions can be both substantive resolutions and procedural resolutions. In addition, resolutions can be classified by the organ in which they originate, e.g.: * United Nations General Assembly resolutions * United Nations Security Council resolutions ==References== * ","title":"United Nations resolution"},{"id":"1437231","text":"The People's Palace and Winter Gardens in Glasgow, Scotland is a museum and glasshouse situated in Glasgow Green, and was opened on 22 January 1898 by the Earl of Rosebery. ==Early history== At the time, the East End of Glasgow was one of the most unhealthy and overcrowded parts of the city, and the People's Palace was intended to provide a cultural centre for the people. It was designed by the City Engineer, Alexander B. McDonald. At the opening ceremony Lord Rosebery stated: \\"A palace of pleasure and imagination around which the people may place their affections and which may give them a home on which their memory may rest\\". He declared the building \\"Open to the people for ever and ever\\". ==Features== The facade of the People's Palace The Winter Gardens: conservatory at the rear of the People's Palace Interior, Peoples Palace, Glasgow Originally, the ground floor of the building provided reading and recreation rooms, with a museum on the first floor, and a picture gallery on the top floor. Since the 1940s, it has been the museum of social history for the city of Glasgow, and tells the story of the people and the city from 1750 to the present day. The collections and displays reflect the changing face of the city and the different experiences of Glaswegians at home, work and leisure. Current displays (as of March 2009) include glimpses of typical Glasgow history such as life in a \\"single end\\" (a one-room tenement home), going to \\"The Steamie\\" (the communal laundry), nights out at \\"The Dancing\\" in the famous Barrowland Ballroom and trips \\"Doon The Watter\\" (down the Firth of Clyde) on steamers such as the Waverley. The palace is also home to renowned Scottish Socialist John MacLean's campaign desk, which can be found on the first floor. ==Closure== The building was closed for almost two years, to allow restoration work to be carried out, with the re-opening being timed to coincide with the 100-year anniversary of its first opening in 1898; this is recorded on a plaque mounted just inside the main entrance. Renovations extended to include the Winter Gardens to the rear of the building, where the glasshouse was extensively restored and reglazed, and the gardens tidied. ==Restoration== As part of the restoration the artist Ken Currie was commissioned to create a series of paintings for the ceiling dome of the museum. The eight panels mark the 200th anniversary of the Calton weavers Massacre of 1787 and depict the history of Glasgow's workers from that point to the present day. In 2005 the Doulton Fountain was extensively refurbished and moved to its present position in front of the museum. At 46 feet high and 70 feet across at its base, it is the largest terracotta fountain in the world. It was originally gifted to the city in 1888 after the International Exhibition of Science, Art and Industry by Sir Henry Doulton to commemorate Queen Victoria‚Äôs Golden Jubilee, and is decorated with a figure of the Queen and groups from Canada, Australia, India and South Africa representing Britain's Empire. == The People's Palace cat == Plaque dedicated to Smudge outside the People's Palace During the 1980s, a cat called Smudge gained local fame when she became a member of the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trade Union, after NALGO refused her admission as a blue collar worker. == References == ==External links== * People's Palace website * The Glasgow History Mural * The Doulton Fountain * People's Palace and Winter Gardens- Clyde Waterfront Heritage Category:Government buildings completed in 1898 Category:Category A listed buildings in Glasgow Category:Museums in Glasgow Category:History museums in Scotland Category:Gardens in Glasgow Category:Greenhouses in the United Kingdom Glasgow Category:Glasgow Green Category:Sandstone buildings ","title":"People's Palace, Glasgow"},{"id":"1437235","text":"An audiobook (or a talking book) is a recording of a book or other work being read out loud. A reading of the complete text is described as \\"unabridged\\", while readings of a shorter version are an abridgement. Spoken audio has been available in schools and public libraries and to a lesser extent in music shops since the 1930s. Many spoken word albums were made prior to the age of cassettes, compact discs, and downloadable audio, often of poetry and plays rather than books. It was not until the 1980s that the medium began to attract book retailers, and then book retailers started displaying audiobooks on bookshelves rather than in separate displays. ==Etymology== The term \\"talking book\\" came into being in the 1930s with government programs designed for blind readers, while the term \\"audiobook\\" came into use during the 1970s when audiocassettes began to replace records. In 1994, the Audio Publishers Association established the term \\"audiobook\\" as the industry standard. ==History== Caption reads: \\"The phonograph at home reading out a novel.\\" From Daily Graphic (New York), 2 April 1878. Less than a year after the invention of the phonograph, this drawing offered a future vision. Novels however would remain impractical for phonographs until the 1930s. Spoken word recordings first became possible with the invention of the phonograph by Thomas Edison in 1877. \\"Phonographic books\\" were one of the original applications envisioned by Edison which would \\"speak to blind people without effort on their part.\\" The initial words spoken into the phonograph were Edison's recital of \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\\", the first instance of recorded verse. In 1878, a demonstration at the Royal Institution in Britain included \\"Hey Diddle Diddle, the Cat and the Fiddle\\" and a line of Tennyson's poetry thus establishing from the very beginning of the technology its association with spoken literature. ===United States=== ====Beginnings to 1970==== Many short, spoken word recordings were sold on cylinder in the late 1800s and early 1900s, however the round cylinders were limited to about 4 minutes each making books impractical; flat platters increased to 12 minutes but this too was impractical for longer works. \\"One early listener complained that he would need a wheelbarrow to carry around talking books recorded on discs with such limited storage capacity.\\" By the 1930s close-grooved records increased to 20 minutes making possible longer narrative. In 1931, the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB) and Library of Congress Books for the Adult Blind Project established the \\"Talking Books Program\\" (Books for the Blind), which was intended to provide reading material for veterans injured during World War I and other visually impaired adults. The first test recordings in 1932 included a chapter from Helen Keller's Midstream and Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Raven\\". The organization received congressional approval for exemption from copyright and free postal distribution of talking books. The first recordings made for the Talking Books Program in 1934 included sections of the Bible; the Declaration of Independence and other patriotic documents; plays and sonnets by Shakespeare; and fiction by Gladys Hasty Carroll, E. M. Delafield, Cora Jarrett, Rudyard Kipling, John Masefield, and P. G. Wodehouse. Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic (RFBD, later renamed Learning Ally) was founded in 1948 by Anne T. Macdonald, a member of the New York Public Library's Women's Auxiliary, in response to an influx of inquiries from soldiers who had lost their sight in combat during World War II. The newly passed GI Bill of Rights guaranteed a college education to all veterans, but texts were mostly inaccessible to the recently blinded veterans, who did not read Braille and had little access to live readers. Macdonald mobilized the women of the Auxiliary under the motto \\"Education is a right, not a privilege\\". Members of the Auxiliary transformed the attic of the New York Public Library into a studio, recording textbooks using then state-of-the-art six-inch vinyl SoundScriber phonograph discs that played approximately 12 minutes of material per side. In 1952, Macdonald established recording studios in seven additional cities across the United States. Caedmon Records was a pioneer in the audiobook business, it was the first company dedicated to selling spoken work recordings to the public and has been called the \\"seed\\" of the audiobook industry. Caedmon was formed in New York in 1952 by college graduates Barbara Holdridge and Marianne Roney. Their first release was a collection of poems by Dylan Thomas as read by the author. The LP's B-side contained A Child's Christmas in Wales which was added as an afterthought - the story was obscure and Thomas himself couldn't remember its title when asked what to use to fill up the B-side - but this recording went on to become one of his most loved works, and launched Caedmon into a successful company. The original 1952 recording was a selection for the 2008 United States National Recording Registry, stating it is \\"credited with launching the audiobook industry in the United States\\". Caedmon used LP records, invented in 1948, which made longer recordings more affordable and practical, however most of their works were poems, plays and other short works, not unabridged books due to the LP's limitation of about a 45-minute playing time (combined sides). Listening Library was also a pioneering company, it was one of the first to distribute children's audiobooks to schools, libraries and other special markets, including VA hospitals. It was founded by Anthony Ditlow and his wife in 1955 in their Red Bank, New Jersey home; Ditlow was partially blind. Another early pioneering company was Spoken Arts founded in 1956 by Arthur Luce Klein and his wife, they produced over 700 recordings and were best known for poetry and drama recordings used in schools and libraries. Like Caedemon, Listening Library and Spoken Arts benefited from the new technology of LPs, but also increased governmental funding for schools and libraries beginning in the 1950s and 60s. ====1970 to 1996==== Though spoken recordings were popular in 33‚Öì vinyl record format for schools and libraries into the early 1970s, the beginning of the modern retail market for audiobooks can be traced to the wide adoption of cassette tapes during the 1970s. Cassette tapes were invented in 1962 and a few libraries, such as the Library of Congress, began distributing books on cassette by 1969. However, during the 1970s, a number of technological innovations allowed the cassette tape wider usage in libraries and also spawned the creation of new commercial audiobook market. These innovations included the introduction of small and cheap portable players such as the Walkman, and the widespread use of cassette decks in cars, particularly imported Japanese models which flooded the market during the multiple energy crises of the decade. In the early 1970s, instructional recordings were among the first commercial products sold on cassette. There were 8 companies distributing materials on cassette with titles such as Managing and Selling Companies (12 cassettes, $300) and Executive Seminar in Sound on a series of 60-minute cassettes. In libraries, most books on cassette were still made for the blind and handicapped, however some new companies saw the opportunity for making audiobooks for a wider audience, such as Voice Over Books which produced abridged best-sellers with professional actors. Early pioneers included Olympic gold medalist Duvall Hecht who in 1975 founded the California-based Books on Tape as a direct to consumer mail order rental service for unabridged audiobooks and expanded their services selling their products to libraries and audiobooks gaining popularity with commuters and travelers. In 1978, Henry Trentman, a traveling salesman who listened to sales tapes while driving long distances, had the idea to create quality unabridged recordings of classic literature read by professional actors. His company, the Maryland-based Recorded Books, followed the model of Books on Tape but with higher quality studio recordings and actors. Recorded Books and Chivers Audio Books were the first to develop integrated production teams and to work with professional actors. By 1984, there were eleven audiobook publishing companies, they included Caedmon, Metacom, Newman Communications, Recorded Books, Brilliance and Books on Tape. The companies were small, the largest had a catalog of 200 titles. Some abridged titles were being sold in bookstores, such as Walden Books, but had negligible sales figures, many were sold by mail-order subscription or through libraries. However, in 1984, Brilliance Audio invented a technique for recording twice as much on the same cassette thus allowing for affordable unabridged editions. The technique involved recording on each of the two channels of each stereo track. This opened the market to new opportunities and by September 1985, Publishers Weekly identified twenty-one audiobook publishers. These included new major publishers such as Harper and Row, Random House, and Warner Communications. 1986 has been identified as the turning point in the industry, when it matured from an experimental curiosity. A number of events happened: the Audio Publishers Association, a professional non-profit trade association, was established by publishers who joined together to promote awareness of spoken word audio and provide industry statistic. Time-Life began offering members audiobooks. Book-of-the-Month club began offering audiobooks to its members, as did the Literary Guild. Other clubs such as the History Book Club, Get Rich Club, Nostalgia Book Club, Scholastic club for children all began offering audiobooks. Publishers began releasing religious and inspirational titles in Christian bookstores. By May 1987, Publishers Weekly initiated a regular column to cover the industry. By the end of 1987, the audiobook market was estimated to be a $200 million market, and audiobooks on cassette were being sold in 75% of regional and independent bookstores surveyed by Publishers Weekly. By August 1988 there were forty audiobook publishers, about four times as many as in 1984. By the middle of the 1990s, the audio publishing business grew to 1.5 billion dollars a year in retail value. In 1996, the Audio Publishers Association established the Audie Awards for audiobooks, which is equivalent to the Oscar for the audiobook industry. The nominees are announced each year by February. The winners are announced at a gala banquet in May, usually in conjunction with BookExpo America. ====1996 to present==== With the spread of the Internet to consumers in the 1990s, faster download speeds with broadband technologies, new compressed audio formats and portable media players, the popularity of audiobooks increased significantly during the late 1990s and 2000s. In 1997, Audible pioneered the world's first mass-market digital media player, named \\"The Audible Player\\", it retailed for $200, held 2 hours of audio and was touted as being \\"smaller and lighter than a Walkman\\", the popular cassette player used at the time. Digital audiobooks were a significant new milestone as they allowed listeners freedom from physical media such as cassettes and CD-ROMs which required transportation through the mail, allowing instead instant download access from online libraries of unlimited size, and portability using comparatively small and lightweight devices. Audible.com was the first to establish a website, in 1998, from which digital audiobooks could be purchased. Another innovation was the creation of LibriVox in 2005 by Montreal-based writer Hugh McGuire who posed the question on his blog: \\"Can the net harness a bunch of volunteers to help bring books in the public domain to life through podcasting?\\" Thus began the creation of public domain audiobooks by volunteer narrators. By the end of 2017, LibriVox had a catalog of over 12,000 works and was producing about 1,000 per year. The transition from vinyl, to cassette, to CD, to MP3CD, to digital download has been documented by Audio Publishers Association in annual surveys (the earlier transition from record to cassette is described in the section on the 1970s). The final year that cassettes represented greater than 50% of total market sales was 2002.Audio Publishers Association Fact Sheet (also includes some historical perspective in the 1950s by Marianne Roney) Cassettes were replaced by CDs as the dominant medium during 2003-2004. CDs reached a peak of 78% of sales in 2008, then began to decline in favor of digital downloads. The 2012 survey found CDs accounted for \\"nearly half\\" of all sales meaning it was no longer the dominate medium (APA did not report the digital download figures for 2012, but in 2011 CDs accounted for 53% and digital download was 41%). The APA estimates that audiobook sales in 2015 in digital format increased by 34% over 2014. APA, 23 May 2016 The resurgence of audio storytelling is widely attributed to advances in mobile technologies such as smartphones, tablets, and multimedia entertainment systems in cars, also known as connected car platforms. Audio drama recordings are also now podcast over the internet. In 2014, Bob & Debra Deyan of Deyan Audio opened the Deyan Institute of Vocal Artistry and Technology, the world's first campus and school for teaching the art and technology of audiobook production. In 2018, approximately 50,000 audiobooks were recorded in the United States with a sales growth of 20 percent year over year. U.S. audiobook sales in 2019 totaled 1.2 billion dollars, up 16% from the previous year. In addition to the sales increase, Edison Research‚Äôs national survey of American audiobook listeners ages 18 and up found that the average number of audiobooks listened to per year increased to 8.1 in 2020, up from 6.8 in 2019.https://www.audiopub.org/uploads/pdf/2020-Consumer-Survey-and-2019-Sales- Survey-Press-Release-FINAL.pdf ===Germany=== The evolution and use of audiobooks in Germany closely parallels that of the US. A special example of its use is the West German Audio Book Library for the Blind, founded in 1955. Actors from the municipal theater in M√ºnster recorded the first audio books for the visually impaired in an improvised studio lined with egg cartons. Because trams rattled past, these first productions took place at night. Later, texts were recorded by trained speakers in professional studios and distributed to users by mail. Until the 1970s recordings were on tape reels, then later cassettes. Since 2004, the offerings have been recorded in the DAISY Digital Talking Book MP3 standard, which provides additional features for visually impaired users to both listen and navigate written material aurally.Sabine Tenta: The Audible Gate to the World: The West German Audio Book Library for the Blind (Goethe-Institut, 2009) online retrieved 26 May 2012 ===India=== Audiobooks in India started to appear somewhat later than in the rest of the world. Only by 2010 did Audiobooks gain mainstream popularity in the Indian market. This is primarily due to lack of previous organized efforts on the part of publishers and authors. The marketing efforts and availability of Audiobooks has made India as one of the fastest growing Audiobooks markets in the world. The lifestyle of urban Indian population and one of the highest daily commute time in the world has also helped in making Audiobooks popular in the region. Business and Self Help books have widespread appeal and have been more popular than fiction/non-fiction. This is because Audiobooks are primarily seen as an avenue for self-improvement and education, rather than entertainment. Audio books are being released in various Indian languages. In Malayalam, the first audio novel, titled Ouija Board, was released by Kathacafe in 2018. Now Indian companies are working towards Audio Books generation in the Indian Vernacular Languages. Listen Stories By Sahitya Chintan is an Android audio book library allowing listing 1000+ Hindi Audio Books. They are offering ample audio books freely. To access the entire catalog they are charging nominal membership of Rs. 199/ Year for Indian audio book listener and $5.99/Year for Rest of World. ==Production== Producing an audiobook consists of a narrator sitting in a recording booth reading the text, while a studio engineer and a director record and direct the performance.ALLEN PIERLEONI. \\"The right voice can send an audiobook up the charts\\", McClatchy Newspapers, 29 June 2011. If a mistake is made the recording is stopped and the narrator reads it again. With recent advancements in recording technology, many audiobooks are also now recorded in home studios by narrators working independently. Audiobooks produced by major publishing houses undergo a proofing and editing process after narration is recorded. Narrators are usually paid on a finished recorded hour basis, meaning if it took 20 hours to produce a 5-hour book, the narrator is paid for 5 hours, thus providing an incentive not to make mistakes. Depending on the narrator they are paid per finished hour to (). The overall cost to produce an audiobook can vary significantly, as longer books require more studio time and more well known narrators come at a premium. According to a representative at Audible, the cost of recording an audiobook has fallen from around in the late 1990s to around - in 2014. ==Formats== An audiobook collection in a library. A mix of cassette tape and CD-ROM formats. Audiobooks are distributed on any audio format available, but primarily these are records, cassette tapes, CDs, MP3 CDs, downloadable digital formats (e.g., MP3 (.mp3), Windows Media Audio (.wma), Advanced Audio Coding (.aac)), and solid state preloaded digital devices in which the audio content is preloaded and sold together with a hardware device. In 1955, a German inventor introduced the Sound Book cassette system based on the Tefifon format where instead of a magnetic tape the sound was recorded on a continuous loop of grooved vinylite ribbon similar to the old 8-track tape. Even though the original Tefifon upon which it was based ran at 19 CPS and could hold a maximum of 4 hours, one Sound Book could hold eight hours of recordings as it ran at half the speed or 9.5 CPS. However, just like the Tefifon, the format never became widespread in use.\\"Grooved Tape Recording Plays For Eight Hours.\\" Popular Mechanics, July 1955, p. 141. A small number of books are recorded for radio broadcast, usually in abridged form and sometimes serialized, notably National Public Radio's broadcast of Star Wars and several projects by the BBC. Audiobooks may come as fully dramatized versions of the printed book, sometimes calling upon a complete cast, music, and sound effects. Effectively audio dramas, these audiobooks are known as full cast audio books. BBC radio stations Radio 3, Radio 4, and Radio 4 Extra have broadcast such productions as the William Gibson novel Neuromancer. An audio first production is a spoken word audio work that is an original production but not based on a book. Examples include Joe Hill, the son of Stephen King, who released a Vinyl First audiobook called Dark Carousel in 2018. It came in a 2-LP vinyl set, or as a downloadable MP3, but with no published text. Another example includes Spin, The Audiobook Musical (2018), a musical rendition of Rumpelstiltskin narrated by Jim Dale, and featuring a cast of Broadway musical stars. ==Use== Audiobook used to disseminate information among farmers in Kenya. Audiobooks have been used to teach children to read and to increase reading comprehension. They are also useful for the blind. The National Library of Congress in the U.S. and the CNIB Library in Canada provide free audiobook library services to the visually impaired; requested books are mailed out (at no cost) to clients. Founded in 1996, Assistive Media of Ann Arbor, Michigan was the first organization to produce and deliver spoken-word recordings of written journalistic and literary works via the Internet to serve people with visual impairments. About 40 percent of all audiobook consumption occurs through public libraries, with the remainder served primarily through retail book stores. Library download programs are currently experiencing rapid growth (more than 5,000 public libraries offer free downloadable audio books). Libraries are also popular places to check out audio books in the CD format. According to the National Endowment for the Arts' study, \\"Reading at Risk: A Survey of Literary Reading in America\\" (2004), audiobook listening is one of very few \\"types\\" of reading that is increasing general literacy. ==Listening practices== Audiobooks are considered a valuable tool because of their format. Unlike traditional books or a video program, one can listen to an audiobook while doing other tasks. Such tasks include doing the laundry, exercising, weeding and similar activities. The most popular general use of audiobooks by adults is when commuting with an automobile or while traveling with public transport, as an alternative to radio. Many people listen as well just to relax or as they drift off to sleep. A recent survey released by the Audio Publishers Association found that the overwhelming majority of audiobook users listen in the car, and more than two-thirds of audiobook buyers described audiobooks as relaxing and a good way to multitask. Another stated reason for choosing audiobooks over other formats is that an audio performance makes some books more interesting. Common practices include: * Replaying: Depending upon one's degree of attention and interest, it is often necessary to listen to segments of an audiobook more than once to allow the material to be understood and retained satisfactorily. Replaying may be done immediately or after extended periods of time. * Learning: People may listen to an audiobook (usually an unabridged one) while following along in an actual book. This helps them to learn words that they may not learn correctly if they were only to read the book. This can also be a very effective way to learn a new language. * Multitasking: Many audiobook listeners choose the format because it allows multitasking during otherwise mundane or routine tasks such as exercising, crafting, or cooking. * Entertainment: Audiobooks have become a popular form of travel entertainment for families or commuters. ==Charitable and nonprofit organizations== Founded in 1948, Learning Ally serves more than 300,000 K-12, college and graduate students, veterans and lifelong learners ‚Äì all of whom cannot read standard print due to blindness, visual impairment, dyslexia, or other learning disabilities. Learning Ally's collection of more than 80,000 human-narrated textbooks and literature titles can be downloaded on mainstream smartphones and tablets, and is the largest of its kind in the world. Founded in 2002, Bookshare is an online library of computer-read audiobooks in accessible formats for people with print disabilities. Founded in 2005, LibriVox is also an online library of downloadable audiobooks and a free non for profit organisation developed by Hugh McGuire. It has audiobooks in several languages. Most of their languages are typically Western European languages. Calibre Audio Library is a UK charity providing a subscription- free service of unabridged audiobooks for people with sight problems, dyslexia or other disabilities, who cannot read print. They have a library of over 8,550 fiction and non-fiction titles which can be borrowed by post on MP3 CDs and memory sticks or via streaming. Listening Books is a UK audiobook charity providing an internet streaming, download and postal service to anyone who has a disability or illness which makes it difficult to hold a book, turn its pages, or read in the usual way, this includes people with visual, physical, learning or mental health difficulties. They have audiobooks for both leisure and learning and a library of over 7,500 titles which are recorded in their own digital studios or commercially sourced. The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) is a UK charity which offers a Talking Books library service. The audio books are provided in DAISY format and delivered to the reader's house by post as a CD or USB memory stick. There are over 30,000 audio books available to borrow, which are free to print disabled library members. RNIB subsidises the Talking Books service by around ¬£4 million a year. Example of an audio studio for professional readings. The studio is surrounded in sound baffle panels to mitigate reverberation from the speaker, allowing the microphone to pick up clearer audio. ==See also== * Assistive Media * National Audio Theatre Festival * Pingshu * Playaway * Radio drama * Text-to-speech * Voice acting ==ReferencesCategory:Accessible information Category:Blindness equipment Category:Book formats Category:Words coined in the 1930s ","title":"Audiobook"},{"id":"1437246","text":"Koninklijke Sint-Truidense Voetbalvereniging (), commonly known as Sint- Truiden or STVV () or by their nickname De Kanaries (, is a Belgian professional football club located in the city of Sint-Truiden in Limburg. Sint-Truiden plays in the Belgian Pro League. Their best ranking was a second place in 1965‚Äì66. They also reached the final of the Belgian Cup twice. The club was founded in 1924. They are matricule number 373. The club colours are yellow and blue, hence their nickname De Kanaries, meaning 'The Canaries'. They play their home games at the Stayen since 1927. ==History== The club was created in 1924 following the merger between FC Union and FC Goldstar, two clubs from Sint-Truiden. The colors of the club were chosen to be yellow and blue, to match the colors of the city, and it was named Sint-Truidense Voetbal Vereeniging. The first game of the team, against Cercle Tongeren, was played in front of only 9 attendees. In the late 1930s, L√©opold Appeltans was the leading player of Sint-Truidense. On 21 November 1948 he became the first capped player for Belgium while playing at this club. In the late 1940s it qualified for the second division. It also changed its name to Sint-Truidense Voetbalvereniging in 1947. Five years later it finished second in the second division and thus promoted to the first division. Successful manager Raymond Goethals arrived at Sint-Truiden in 1959. Under his management, the team finished second of the top division in 1966. The former Sint-Truidense goalkeeper Jacky Mathijssen became the manager of the club in 2001 and remained at the helm for three seasons after which he left for Charleroi. He was replaced by Marc Wilmots, who was fired shortly after. The team finished the season under the coaching of the trio Guy Mangelschots, Eddy Raymaekers and Peter Voets. At the end of the 2004‚Äì05 season the board of directors hired Oostende manager Herman Vermeulen but he was dismissed on 9 February 2006 as the club pointed at the seventeenth position in the ranking. In 2008 the women's team of FCL Rapide Wezemaal joined STVV. ==Honours== *Belgian First Division: **Runners-up (1): 1965‚Äì66 *Belgian Second Division: **Winners (4): 1986‚Äì87, 1993‚Äì94, 2008‚Äì09, 2014‚Äì15 *Belgian Cup: **Runners-up (2): 1970‚Äì71, 2002‚Äì03 *Belgian League Cup: **Winners (1): 1997‚Äì98 ==European record== :As of 5 March 2006: { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" ----- ! efefef;\\"  Competition ! efefef;\\"  APP ! efefef;\\"  P ! efefef;\\"  W ! efefef;\\"  D ! efefef;\\"  L ! efefef;\\"  GF ! efefef;\\"  GA -----  Intertoto Cup  2  8  5  0  3  15  8 } ==Current squad== https://www.stvv.com/en/teams/first-team ===On loan=== ==Coaching and medical staff== *Manager: Kevin Muscat *Assistant manager: Carlos P√©rez Salvach√∫a *Assistant manager: Luciano Trani *Physical coach: Bart Van Lancker *Team manager: Peter Delorge *Goalkeeping coach: Bram Verbist *Team representative: Romain Proesmans *Kit men: Benny Liebens & Valere Stevens *Club Doctors: Steven Bex & Koen Pansaers *Physiotherapists: Tim Vollon & Arnold Wilmots *Masseur: Roger Reniers ==Managers== * Raymond Goethals (1959‚Äì66) * Ward Volckaert (1966‚Äì69) * Marcel Vercammen (1971‚Äì73) * Gerard Bergholtz (1979‚Äì81) * Wilfried Van Moer (1982‚Äì84) * Eric Vanlessen (1984‚Äì85) * Guy Mangelschots (1986‚Äì90) * Walter Meeuws (1990‚Äì91) * Odilon Polleunis (1991‚Äì92) * Rudy Liebens & Marek Dziuba (1992) * Albert Van Marcke (1992) * Martin Lippens (1992‚Äì93) * Guy Mangelschots (1992‚Äì96) * Wilfried Sleurs (1996) * Freddy Smets (1996‚Äì97) * Guy Mangelschots (1997) * Barry Hulshoff (1997‚Äì98) * Poll Peters (1998‚Äì99) * Willy Reynders (1999‚Äì01) * Jules Knaepen (2001) * Jacky Mathijssen (2001‚Äì04) * Marc Wilmots (2004‚Äì05) * Herman Vermeulen (2005‚Äì06) * Eddy Raeymaekers & Peter Voets (2006) * Thomas Caers (2006) * Peter Voets (2006) * Henk Houwaart (2006‚Äì07) * Val√®re Billen (2007) * Peter Voets (2007) * Dennis Van Wijk (2007‚Äì08) * Guido Brepoels (2008‚Äì11) * Franky Van der Elst (2011‚Äì12) * Guido Brepoels (2012‚Äì13) * Yannick Ferrera (2013‚Äì15) * Chris O'Loughlin (2015‚Äì16) * Ivan Leko (2016‚Äì17) * Tint√≠n M√°rquez (2017) * Jonas De Roeck (2017‚Äì18) * Marc Brys (2018‚Äì19) * Milo≈° Kostiƒá (2020) * Kevin Muscat (2020‚Äìpresent) ==References== * Official website * UEFA page Category:Association football clubs established in 1924 Category:Football clubs in Belgium Category:1924 establishments in Belgium Category:Sport in Limburg (Belgium) Category:Sint-Truiden ","title":"Sint-Truidense V.V."},{"id":"1437250","text":"Eisenberg an der Raab is a small village in Burgenland, Austria south of Sankt Martin an der Raab, near the Slovenian and Hungarian frontiers.

Welcome To Concord Located in northeastern Staten Island, and bordered by the neighborhoods of Grasmere, Clifton, Dongan Hills, Emerson Hill, and Old Town, Concord was named Dutch Farms originally, but was renamed in 1845 after Concord, Massachusetts as a consequence of that town's historical significance. Early residents of Concord included Judge William Emerson (brother of Ralph Waldo Emerson and for whom nearby Emerson Hill is named) and Henry David Thoreau. In the early 19th Century, Concord had a dominant German immigrant population. Today, it is ethnically diverse. Concord currently consists of one-family homes, small apartment buildings, and condominiums. The neighborhood's center is traversed by some of the most heavily traveled roads on Staten Island, including Clove Road; Richmond Road; Targee Street; and the Staten Island Expressway. St. Sylvester's School, early 20th century Much property in Concord was condemned to make way for the Staten Island Expressway in the early 1960s; a principal east‚Äìwest thoroughfare. Price Street is now a service road of the expressway and is known as Narrows Road North. In its first year of existence -- 1961-62 -- Monsignor Farrell High School used an annex of St. Sylvester's Elementary School in Concord while the construction of its permanent campus in Oakwood was being completed. In 1985, Staten Island's first mosque opened in Concord; it later moved to Tompkinsville, however. A small public alternative high school, named Concord High School, is located in the neighborhood, which is also home to a large medical arts complex (on Ralph Place) that had sprung up around the former Doctor's Hospital of Staten Island, which closed in 2003. ==Education== The New York City Department of Education operates public schools. Concord is served by PS 48 on Targee Street and Concord HS on Rhine Avenue. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York operates Staten Island Catholic schools.

Bridge‚Äìtunnels (or \\"Brunnels\\") are a common form of fixed link or fixed crossing which replaces ferry service. Fixed links are often, but not necessarily, intercontinental links between continents or transoceanic links to offshore islands. ==Tunnels and bridge‚Äìtunnels== For water crossings, a tunnel is generally more costly to construct than a bridge. However, navigational considerations at some locations may limit the use of high bridges or drawbridge spans when crossing shipping channels, necessitating the use of a tunnel. Examples of such tunnels include the Downtown Tunnel and Midtown Tunnel under the Elizabeth River between Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia in the United States, the George Massey Tunnel in Greater Vancouver, Canada, and the Cross-Harbour Tunnel under Victoria Harbour between the twin cities of Victoria and Kowloon in Hong Kong. In other instances, when longer distances are involved, a bridge‚Äìtunnel may be less costly and easier to ventilate than a single, lengthy tunnel. This situation may occur when more economical drawbridges are not allowed for one reason or another. For example, in the U.S. state of Virginia, such crossings include the Hampton Roads Bridge‚ÄìTunnel and the Monitor‚ÄìMerrimac Memorial Bridge‚ÄìTunnel, both of which cross the harbor at Hampton Roads, and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge‚ÄìTunnel, a long structure (including approach highways) that crosses the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay with a combination of bridges and tunnels across two widely separated shipping channels, using four artificial islands built in the bay as portals. Tunnels had to be used instead of drawbridges because the waterways they cross are critical to military naval operations (Naval Station Norfolk is nearby, and Chesapeake Bay provides access to the Potomac River and thus to Washington, DC) and could not afford to be blocked off by a bridge collapse in the event of disaster or war. Another example is the √òresund Bridge, connecting Sweden and Denmark. It has a bridge, an artificial island in the middle of the √òresund strait, and a tunnel nearest to Denmark. A bridge could not be built there for two reasons: height restrictions imposed by adjacent Copenhagen International Airport (the route's path passes the ends of some of the runways; the minimum practical height for a bridge would've interfered with airplanes using those runways) and the perennial threat of ice (a bridge's columns would have encouraged ice dams which could block the strait). The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line is a bridge‚Äìtunnel combination across Tokyo Bay in Japan. It connects the city of Kawasaki in Kanagawa Prefecture with the city of Kisarazu in Chiba Prefecture. With an overall length of , it includes a bridge and tunnel underneath the bay‚Äîwhich is the longest underwater tunnel for cars in the world. Drawbridges were impractical here because Tokyo Bay is too active a sea lane. The longest crossing on the Yangtze River in China is a tunnel-bridge-bridge complex, consisting of the Shanghai Yangtze River Tunnel, Shanghai Yangtze River Bridge (one of the longest cable-stayed bridges in the world), Chongming‚ÄìQidong Yangtze River Bridge and connecting viaducts at the river's mouth in Shanghai.

The missile is produced by Denel Dynamics, formerly Kentron. The current version uses semi- active laser (SAL) guidance, requiring the target to be illuminated by a laser designator either on the launch platform or elsewhere; though there are alternative guidance packages available including a millimetre-wave radar (MMW) seeker and a two-colour imaging infrared (IIR) seeker. All variants of the Mokopa feature two launch modes, Lock-On Before Launch (LOBL) and Lock-On After Launch (LOAL). LOBL is the older, more conventional mode of missile launching, where the target has to be illuminated by the launch platform before launch. LOAL on the other hand allows the launch platform to launch the missile even though it may not be in sight of the target. In terms of the SAL version, this would then allow either the launch platform to move into place and only illuminate the target immediately prior to the missile striking the target, or it would allow an observer on the ground equipped with a laser designator to guide the missile in. This method of launching greatly reduces the exposure time of the launch platform to enemy fire. ==Development== Full scale development of the Mokopa began in November 1996, due to the ongoing United States arms embargo against South Africa making acquisition of the AGM-114 Hellfire impossible. The first air-launched tests from a Rooivalk helicopter took place in 1999, with the first guided tests following in 2000. As of 2005 the missile's development is virtually complete, and the first batches are currently being delivered to the SA Air Force's Rooivalk squadron. However, due to budgetary constraints the South African Air Force has decided to stop the integration of the weapon onto the Rooivalk until an unspecified date. ==Launch vehicles and platforms== Though primarily designed to be launched from a helicopter, the Mokopa has been tested on a variety of platforms, including its mounting on light armoured vehicles and on ships or small boats. For the latter purpose, the Mokopa is available with an anti-ship warhead. ==Warhead== The Mokopa uses a powerful tandem shaped-charge, high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead, capable of penetrating over 1,350 mm (almost 4¬Ω ft) of Rolled homogeneous armour (RHA), and also effective against Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA). This means the Mokopa is able to counter any current vehicle armour threats. An anti-ship warhead is also available for customers who wish to use the Mokopa as a ship-board defence weapon, or as the armament of specialised ship-board helicopters. ==Performance== The missile is considered to be very accurate, with an accuracy believed to match that of the company's other anti-tank missile, the Ingwe, at around 300 mm CEP at maximum range. It also has a long range for an anti-tank missile; at 10 km (6.2 mi) it is greater than the published range of most current competitors, including the Hellfire. The range is achieved due to an advanced solid-fuel composite rocket motor (developed by Somchem), which has a relatively slow burning rate compared to similar motors, as well as being essentially smokeless. ==Users== * Algerian National Navy ‚ÄìIn 2012 Algeria also ordered 100 Mokopa anti-tank missiles in 2012 under a R360 million deal, according to SIPRI. These are destined for use aboard its Lynx naval helicopters that will be deployed on its new Meko A-200 frigates.http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php option=com_content&view;=article&id;=38561&catid;=74&Itemid;=30 According to Flightglobal, the Algerian Navy's six new Super Lynx 300-series helicopters were conducting flight tests in 2014 armed with Mokopa anti-armour missiles. ==See also== * List of missiles ===Comparable missiles=== * AGM-114 Hellfire * Brimstone missile ==References== ==External links== * Denel Dynamics * Denel Dynamics Product Brochures (PDF) Category:Air-to-surface missiles Category:Anti-tank missiles of South Africa Category:Guided missiles of South Africa Category:Post‚ÄìCold War weapons of South Africa Category:Denel ","title":"Mokopa"},{"id":"1437304","text":"Richard Lugner (Vienna 2019) Richard Lugner (l.) with German painter Johann Gassenhuber Richard \\"M√∂rtel\\" Lugner (born 11 October 1932) is an Austrian entrepreneur in the construction industry, a Viennese society figure, and a former political candidate not affiliated with any of the Austrian political parties. == Early life and family == Richard Lugner is the son of the lawyer Richard Lugner senior, who went missing in 1943 after becoming a prisoner of war in Russia during WWII. ==Business career== Born in Vienna, Lugner got a licence to work as a building contractor (Baumeisterkonzession) in 1962 and at first specialized in the erection of filling stations and the renovation of old buildings. His company started to prosper, and he eventually became known to a wider public with the completion, in 1979, of Vienna's first mosque, situated on the banks of the river Danube. In 1990 he opened his own shopping mall, Lugner City, in a working class district of Vienna and, from the start, aggressively advertised his business by regularly inviting celebrities-- starting with Thomas Gottschalk--who would perform there and sign autographs-- a marketing strategy not very common in a city that, back then, hardly had any shopping malls. Through his shopping mall, Lugner was one of a small group of businesspeople who helped change Austrians' shopping habits by pushing to the limits the various regulations concerning opening hours. In a city where shops generally closed at 6 p.m. Mondays to Fridays and at noon on Saturdays to remain closed for more than one and a half days until Monday morning, Lugner strongly advocated late night shopping on at least one weekday and an extension of shopping hours to Saturday afternoon, even when that meant raising the trades unions' opposition. ==Celebrities== \\"M√∂rtel\\" Lugner with Brigitte Nielsen (c.) and his wife Christina, 2012 at his Lugner City mall In 1992 M√∂rtel and Mausi Lugner brought Harry Belafonte to Lugner City, and also took him along to the Vienna Opera Ball. From that time on, the couple have each year paid a celebrity to visit the shopping centre and then accompany them as their guest to that prestigious function at the Vienna State Opera, an \\"invitation\\" which has often been criticised or just belittled for being a nouveau riche idea. However, media attention has continually been rising, also abroad, so that today any official guests of honour are usually neglected compared to the Lugners' celebrities, who invariably have a status image: *1991 Gina Lollobrigida *1992 Harry Belafonte *1993 Joan Collins *1994 Ivana Trump *1995 Sophia Loren *1996 Grace Jones *1997 Sarah, Duchess of York *1998 Raquel Welch *1999 Faye Dunaway *2000 Jacqueline Bisset *2001 Farrah Fawcett *2002 Claudia Cardinale *2003 Pamela Anderson *2004 Andie MacDowell *2005 Geri Halliwell *2006 Carmen Electra *2007 Paris Hilton *2008 Dita von Teese *2009 Nicollette Sheridan *2010 Dieter Bohlen (originally meant to be Lindsay Lohan) *2011 Larry Hagman, Karima El Mahroug aka Ruby the Heart Stealer, and Zachi Noy *2012 Brigitte Nielsen, Roger Moore *2013 Mira Sorvino, Gina Lollobrigida *2014 Kim Kardashian *2015 Elisabetta Canalis *2016 Brooke Shields *2017 Goldie Hawn *2018 Melanie Griffith *2019 Elle Macpherson *2020 Ornella Muti ==Political ambitions== In the late 1990s Richard Lugner handed over his business to his two grown-up sons by an earlier marriage, Alexander and Andreas Lugner, and went into politics. In the 1998 presidential elections he finished fourth in a field of five candidates, receiving 9.91 per cent of the popular vote; incumbent Federal President Thomas Klestil, who had been running for a second term of office, received 63.4%. For the parliamentary elections that took place the following year, the Lugners organised a separate platform called Die Unabh√§ngigen (\\"The Independents\\") but, as they only received 1.02 per cent of the vote, did not get any seats in the Nationalrat. Nevertheless, at the end of the millennium, a survey found that more than 90 per cent of Austrians recognized the name Lugner. For the 2016 presidential election he announced to collect the necessary signatures in order to participate.Political Earthquake in Austria indicates received 2.4% in lowest turnout on record ==Personal== In September 2014, Lugner (aged 81) married German Playboy model Cathy Schmitz (aged 24) at a ceremony held at the Sch√∂nbrunn Palace in Vienna.

The artists installed 7,503 vinyl \\"gates\\" along of pathways in Central Park in New York City. From each gate hung a panel of deep saffron-colored nylon fabric. The exhibit ran from February 12, 2005 through February 27, 2005. The books and other memorabilia distributed by Christo and Jeanne-Claude refer to the project as The Gates, Central Park, New York, 1979‚Äì2005 in reference to the time that passed from the artists' initial proposal until they were able to go ahead with it. The Gates were greeted with mixed reactions. Some people loved them for brightening the bleak winter landscape and encouraging late-night pedestrian traffic in Central Park; others hated them, accusing them of defacing the landscape. It was seen as an obstruction to bicyclists, who felt that the gates could cause accidents, although cycling was not legal on those paths. The artists received a great deal of their nationwide fame as a frequent object of ridicule by David Letterman, as well as by Keith Olbermann, whose apartment was nearby. ==Fabrication== ===Construction and cost=== The total materials used according to the artists were 5,390 tons of steel, 315,491 feet (96 km) of vinyl tubing, 99,155 square metres of fabric, and 15,000 sets of brackets and hardware. The gates were assembled in a 25,000 square foot (2,300 m¬≤) Long Island facility, then trucked to Central Park. The textile was produced and sewn in Germany. As one of the conditions for use of the park space, the steel bases rested upon, but remained unattached to, the walkways, so that no holes were drilled and no permanent changes were made to the park. The artists sold pieces of their own artwork, including preparatory drawings for The Gates, to finance the project. They offered a cost of $21 million and the details are published in the Harvard Business School. Greg Allen and The New York Times attempted to itemize the costs and could account for about $5‚Äì10 million, given reasonable estimates for parts, labor, and costs related to the staffing of the installation.

Greg Allen, greg.org, February 13, 2005.\\"Enough About 'Gates' as Art; Let's Talk About That Price Tag.\\" The New York Times, March 5, 2005, investigates the $21 million claim. ===Installation=== During construction: one of the many metal base parts (Feb. 6) On Feb 13, 2004, work began on the installation of the project. During the week of March 17, the park filled with workers using forklift vehicles to move the rectangular steel plates into position all over Central Park. There were small signs placed on every walkway in the park with alphanumeric codes which the workers used to place the metal plates onto the designated spots. By April 10th, most of the rectangular metal plates were positioned. All had small orange plastic markers sticking up two feet (around half a meter) from each end, possibly intended to help people find the base plates if they were covered with snow. A major snow storm on January 22 and extreme cold hampered progress. Hardware used to ensure that the vertical pieces were parallel, even when the base plates themselves were not level, due to uneven or sloped ground On Monday, February 7, 2005, over 100 teams of eight workers each, wearing grey uniform smocks, began erecting the gates and bolting them to the base plates. The artists specified the color as saffron but many local observers described it as orange. The fabric hung from the crossbars at the top, high, from which it was unfurled on opening day, February 12. The most common width seems to have been although the width varied, depending on the width of the path, from 5 feet 6 inches to 18 feet. ==Display== ===Opening=== Before unfurling The project was officially launched on February 12, 2005, when then- New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg dropped the first piece of fabric at 8:30 a.m., with Christo and Jeanne-Claude in attendance. The rest of The Gates were opened subsequently throughout the park and were completed within the next few hours with large crowds of people watching. Generally, the crews of workers who erected the gates were assigned to open them. They walked underneath, and used a hook at the end of a long stick to pull a loop hanging from the crossbar of each gate. That opened the cloth bag containing the fabric panel part of the gate. The bag fell to the ground, along with a cardboard tube around which the fabric was rolled. The fabric part then hung from the horizontal crossbar. By the afternoon of February 12, all of the panels were unfurled. The project staff remained deployed in the park, patrolling, and replacing damaged gates. On many days, staff members distributed free 2.75\\" square souvenir swatches of the orange fabric to passers by, in part intended to discourage vandalism. Nevertheless, one of the gates, near the Shakespeare Garden in front of the Delacorte Theatre, was vandalized and replaced frequently. The swatches remain highly collectible and trade on eBay for about $10 each. ===Closure and legacy=== Al Maysles, Antonio Ferrera, Jeanne-Claude and Christo at the 6th Annual Peabody Awards for The Gates The installation was set to close February 27, 2005.Central Park's 'Gates' to close, a February 25, 2005 CNN story Christo and Jeanne-Claude also visited the installation on the last day, entering Central Park at its less congested northern end. Although the Park's roadways were closed to vehicles, they traveled with a police escort in their Maybach sedan. Christo then left the car and walked to several vantage points, capturing last minute photographs with a professional assistant. After the exhibition closed on February 27, the gates and bases were removed. The materials were industrially recycled, partially as scrap metal.

Black Bob originally appeared as a text story in The Dandy in issue 280, dated 25 November 1944; in that story, Black Bob follows his owner's nephew who is playing truant and tries to bring him back to school. The characters were created by John Hunter (1903-1984), originally from Hawick, who worked as a journalist in Dundee, and then came to stay in Selkirk, living in a house in Elm Row, and owning a china and gift shop in Market Place. He wrote the original stories, which were then illustrated by DC Thomson's staff artist, Jack Prout. Amongst other things, John was an Elder in the Church of Scotland, and a member of Selkirk Camera Club. As drawn by Jack Prout, further Black Bob stories appeared as a picture strip in The Weekly News in 1946, continuing until 1967, and regularly in The Dandy from his 1944 debut until issue 2122, dated 24 July 1982. Eight Black Bob books were published at infrequent intervals in 1950, 1951, 1953, 1955, 1957, 1959, 1961 and 1965. The books‚Äô stories are in two formats: (1) Sizeable bodies of text, dispersed throughout with large illustrations and (2) Illustrated panels, each with a paragraph of text below them . A typical large single Jack Prout drawing, as used to illustrate a text-based story.frameless The educational and highly descriptive stories were written for the mid-twentieth-century child, but are sophisticated enough to engage an adult reader. They convey a clear separation of ‚Äòright‚Äô from ‚Äòwrong‚Äô, instilling in the young reader, the values of honesty and benevolence. Bob can't understand words but can understand ‚Äòtone of voice‚Äô and he is not infallible, occasionally but understandably, acting on wrong information. Most stories take place in the valley and hills around Selkirk with others set further afield in Britain and some abroad, accentuating the concept of ‚ÄòHome‚Äô, and it is safely back home where most stories end - often by a cosy fireside. Recurring elements: circuses, children's parties, cliffs and crags, blindness, shady rogues, loss and reunion.

Jack Prout was born on 14 December 1900 and joined the Scottish publishing firm of D. C. Thomson as a staff artist on 21 June 1937. He retired on 30 June 1968 although his strips were reprinted in the Dandy until 1982. Shortly before his retirement, Prout acquired a black and white Border Collie. Staff at D. C. Thomson's presented the artist with a spoof \\"dog licence\\", allowing the animal to keep the artist as a pet. The document was \\"signed\\" with Black Bob's pawprint. Jack Prout died on 27 September 1978. Black Bob was parodied in a strip in Viz comic entitled \\"Black Bag, the Faithful Border Bin Liner\\". ==Sources== Information provided by the publisher of The Dandy and the Black Bob books, namely D.

It was common knowledge in Selkirk at the time that John Hunter was the creator and original writer of the stories; the 'Friends' have interviewed people still living who knew him, and/or the family of those who have since died, to record their memories. Some of those still living who knew John Hunter include a former employee of the local newspaper, who knew that then editor Walter Thomson, and John Hunter, contributed freelance copy to DC Thomson; a man whose great aunt worked in John Hunter's shop, and reported complaints that John spent 'far too much time' in the back room, writing the stories, rather than helping out in the shop; and an employee of the bank branch where John Hunter regularly paid in cheques received for his work for DC Thomson. ==External links== *Friends of John Hunter & Black Bob *Family history for Jack Prout Category:1946 establishments in Scotland Category:Comics about dogs Category:Comics characters introduced in 1946 Category:Dandy strips Category:Fictional dogs Category:1946 comics debuts Category:1982 comics endings Category:Scottish comics characters Category:Comics set in Scotland Category:Male characters in comics ","title":"Black Bob (comics)"},{"id":"1437325","text":"Snaefell () ‚Äì ()Place Names of The Isle of Man ‚Äì Da Ny Manninee Dooie Volume Three.

The A18 Snaefell Mountain Road passes over the slopes of Snaefell, and is the highest section of the Snaefell Mountain Course over which the Isle of Man TT Races are held. Walkers often use the car park on this road near the Bungalow railway station (last railway stop before the summit) from which there is a rough path to the peak. The trail has sections of gravel, slate stones, grass and rock. While the angle of ascent steepens significantly closer to the summit, special climbing equipment is not required.

He received a Master of Arts degree from Lincoln College, Oxford.s:Alumni Oxonienses: the Members of the University of Oxford, 1715-1886/Mayo, Charles Herbert He was appointed Rural Dean and Non-Residentiary Canon of Salisbury and was vicar of Longburton from 1872 to 1912. Whilst there he lived at Longburton Rectory. His great enthusiasm was local history and he promoted its study by publishing many books and articles on the subject, of which 34 are held in the British Library. His greatest work was the Bibliotheca Dorsetiensis published in 1885, which has yet to be supplanted as the standard Dorset antiquarian bibliography. This was derived from his large personal collection of Dorset ephemera and publications. From 1888 until 1921 Canon Mayo was the Dorset Editor of the journal 'Somerset and Dorset Notes and Queries'. He also transcribed many of the registers of local parishes, the municipal records of the Borough of Shaftesbury and the Civil War Minutes of the Dorset Standing Committee, 1646‚Äì50. He wrote A Genealogical Account of the Mayo and Elton Families originally published as a limited edition of 50 copies in 1882 but enlarged for a new edition in 1908. Mayo supported women's suffrage. He died unmarried in 1929. ==Legacy== Mayo's correspondence and research papers are now held by the Dorset History Centre, except for a collection of typewritten notes about the Mayo family held by the Bodleian Library, and two volumes of notes about Bristol and Gloucestershire families held by the Gloucestershire Record Office. ==Bibliography== *Charles Herbert Mayo, A Genealogical Account of the Mayo and Elton Families of the Counties of Wiltshire and Hereford; with an Appendix Containing Genealogies for the Most Part Not Hitherto Published of Certain Families By Marriage to the Family of Mayo, (London: Chiswick Press, 1882) *Charles Herbert Mayo, Bibliotheca Dorsetiensis, (Chiswick: C.

He has amicably been known as \\"Puffy\\", \\"Puffster\\" or \\"The Puff\\", in reference to the afro hair style he wore in the early 1980s. The nicknames were coined by Faith No More guitarist Jim Martin, and they stuck around even after he grew out his hair and tied it in dreadlocks, a trademark look he has worn for most of his career. Mike Bordin was one of the three founding band member of Faith No More in 1983 and was the band's only drummer throughout its span, remaining with the group until its initial breakup in April 1998. He rejoined Faith No More when the band reformed in 2009. Bordin has also performed with Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, Korn, Black Label Society, Jerry Cantrell, Primus, The Chickenfuckers and Pop-O-Pies. Some of his pre-Faith No More bands include Faith. No Man., Sharp Young Men and EZ-Street. Bordin has played alongside all three Metallica bassists over the years; he played with Cliff Burton in EZ- Street and with Jason Newsted and Robert Trujillo with Ozzy Osbourne and Jerry Cantrell. == Biography == ===Early years=== Regarding his ancestral background, Bordin said in a 1990 interview with Australian publication Smash Hits \\"My grandfather came from Russia [and] Kiev. That side of my family is Russian and Welsh. The other side is Italian, Hungarian and i think some Polish too. I'm a real mongrel.\\"\\"Amazin' Faith\\", Smash Hits. September 19, 1990. Billy Gould also mentions Bordin's Jewish descentFaith No More  Sounds Magazine ‚Äì February 3rd 1990: \\"The problem is our manager's Jewish and so is our drummer. I think Public Enemy'd prefer a Jew-free tour.\\"Darren Paltrowitz. Bill Gould on Faith No More‚Äôs Jewish Roots and New ‚ÄòTalking Book II‚Äô AlbumPaltrocast with Darren Paltrowitz. In the late 1970s, while still a student at Castro Valley High School, Bordin formed his first band EZ-Street with future Metallica bassist Cliff Burton. The two recruited local metalhead and future Faith No More guitarist Jim Martin to complete the trio. In 1981, Bordin left EZ-Street because of frictions with guitarist Jim Martin. He joined up with a San Francisco post-punk outfit going under the name of Sharp Young Men. Sharp Young Men was fronted by Mike Morris (also on guitar), with Billy Gould on bass and keyboardist Wade Worthington. After playing a few shows for a year, the band decided to change its name because it didn't like the image it gave off. In late 1982, Sharp Young Men became Faith. No Man., a name that Bordin suggested, meaning \\"Faith In No Man\\". Faith. No Man. recorded a two-song 7\\" single in early 1983, followed by a three-song demo tape in the summer. In between those two recordings, keyboardist Wade Worthington left and was replaced by Billy Gould's childhood friend Roddy Bottum. In the late summer, Bordin, Bottum and Gould quit Faith. No Man. because of frictions with Morris and formed a new band, Faith No More. Faith No More played its first show in October 1983. Bordin's former EZ-Street band-mate Jim Martin later joined the band in the summer of 1984. ===Faith No More=== Faith No More released their first album, We Care a Lot, in 1985. After releasing several more albums, including the Grammy-nominated The Real Thing, Faith No More disbanded in 1998. In 2009, Faith No More reformed and performed a series of festival shows in Europe and Australia, leading to several shows in select American cities. In 2015, Faith No More released Sol Invictus, their first album since Album of the Year, and first since their reunion. It met considerable critical attention, and the band embarked on a worldwide tour. ===Collaborations with Primus=== Bordin has worked closely with Primus on several occasions. He first provided guest vocals on two songs from Primus' 1990 album Frizzle Fry; \\"John the Fisherman\\" and \\"Sathington Willoby\\", credited under the Fart Sandwich Posse band. In 1991 he provided guest vocals and drums on the song \\"Los Bastardos\\" which was released on Sailing the Seas of Cheese. Finally, he played drums on the song \\"Choked\\", a collaboration with Primus' Tim Alexander and Tool's Maynard James Keenan, released on the 1997 compilation Flyin' Traps. ===Ozzy Osbourne=== In 1996, Bordin began performing with Ozzy Osbourne's band. Due to Black Sabbath drummer Bill Ward's health issues during tour, Bordin had a brief stretch playing with the other original members of Black Sabbath. He played the closing segments of Ozzy Osbourne's 1997 headlining concerts during the Ozzfest tour. Bordin re-recorded the drum tracks on Osbourne's solo albums, Blizzard of Ozz and Diary of a Madman, for the controversial remasters released in 2002. The re-recordings were the result of a lawsuit brought by original drummer Lee Kerslake and original bassist Bob Daisley for unpaid royalties. ===Korn=== In 2000, Bordin filled in as Korn's live drummer for approximately 7 months and nearly 100 shows. At the time of his joining, Korn's fourth album Issues had been nominated for two Grammys in March 2000 and had already achieved triple-platinum certification by the RIAA since its release five months earlier, in November 1999. Korn's Sick and Twisted Tour began on February 18, 2000 to promote the full-length. On March 10, 2000, only 14 dates into the tour, Korn drummer David Silveria's right wrist gave out on the night of their concert at the Fargodome in Fargo, North Dakota. The band went out on stage and Silveria announced to the audience that the concert had to be postponed because of his inability to play. The injury was allegedly caused by Silvera's left ribs, and the same limp wrist condition had previously occurred the year before causing the band to cancel the last two shows of their tour with Rob Zombie. Three Midwest dates in Madison, Wisconsin, Minneapolis, Minnesota and Moline, Illinois had to be rescheduled while the band found a replacement. Korn returned to California for a few days and called on Bordin to fill in while Silveria recovered. The band invited Bordin because he was apparently the only drummer they could think of who could perform in the style they wanted. Faith No More had been a major inspiration when Korn started out in the early 1990s and the band later went on to record a cover of We Care a Lot in 2005 for a proposed covers album titled Korn Kovers. Korn spent 5 days (March 11‚Äì15) teaching Bordin an initial 12 songs at their rehearsal space in California, with Silveria present to guide him. Throughout the rest of the year, Bordin learned an additional 10 songs which were added the set list. On March 16, the band flew out to Illinois for their first show with Bordin on drums at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont. Bordin remained with Korn for the rest of the year, which also included The Summer Sanitarium Tour with Metallica in June and July. He also traveled with Korn to Europe to promote Issues. Silveria return to Korn in the fall of 2000 to start writing their fifth album, later released as Untouchables. ===Other appearances=== Bordin performs on Jerry Cantrell's 2002 album, Degradation Trip. On January 21, 2001, Bordin competed on the television game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. He missed the $32,000 question, winning $1,000. His appearance on the show was not on the celebrity edition, but a normal edition with the jackpot raised at $1,810,000. Coincidentally, his wife Merilee had been the contestant right before him. She too reached the $32,000 question and missed. Former Ozzy Osbourne bandmate Robert Trujillo (now of Metallica) attended in the audience. ===Personal life=== Mike Bordin was married in 1994 to Merilee Ann Bordin (n√©e Hague) after dating for 10 years (since 1984). She is a classically trained chef and food stylist who studied at the University of California, Berkeley. Some of her food styling work has appeared in Rick Bayless' Mexican Everyday cookbook published by W.W. Norton & Company in 2005, Sara Perry's Holiday Baking: New and Traditional Recipes for Wintertime Holidays cookbook published by Chronicle Books in 2005, Ghirardelli Chocolate Company's The Ghirardelli Chocolate Cookbook (revised edition) cookbook published by Ten Speed Press in 2007, Andrea Froncillo and Jennifer Jeffrey's Crab - Buying, Cooking, Cracking cookbook published by Ten Speed Press in 2007, and in several issues of Vegetarian Times magazine. Mike and Merilee have two daughters, Abby and Violet. Bordin's eldest daughter Violet was born in 1997 when he was touring for Faith No More's Album of the Year, and she later went on to design poster art for the band == Setup (2009) == As a left-handed drummer, he uses a right-handed kit with his ride cymbal on the left. ;Drums Yamaha Oak Custom * 14x6.5 Mike Bordin Signature Snare * 14x12 Mounted Tom * 15x13 Mounted Tom * 18x16 Floor Tom * 24x17 Bass Drum ;Cymbals Zildjian * 15\\" Rock Hi-Hat Bottom (used as top hat) * 15\\" A Mastersound Hi-Hat Bottom (used as bottom hat) * 19\\" K Medium Thin Dark Crash or K Thin Dark Crash * 20\\" A Medium Crash * 21\\" A Sweet Ride * 22\\" Z Heavy Power Ride * 19\\" K China ;Hardware * Yamaha rack and stands * Drum Workshop 5000 Delta Series Strap Drive Double Pedals ;Heads Remo * Mounted and Floor Toms ‚Äì Coated Emperor (top), Clear Ambassador (bottom) * Snare ‚Äì Emperor-X (batter) * Bass ‚Äì P3 Clear ;Sticks * Vic Firth Rock == Discography == ;Jerry Cantrell * Degradation Trip (2002) ;Ozzy Osbourne * Down to Earth (2001) * Live at Budokan (2002) * Blizzard of Ozz (Re-recording) (2002) * Diary of a Madman (re-recording) (2002) * Under Cover (2005) * Black Rain (2007) == References == Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:American heavy metal drummers Category:American people of Russian descent Category:American people of Ukrainian descent Category:American people of Welsh descent Category:American people of Hungarian descent Category:American people of Italian descent Category:American people of Polish descent Category:American people of Jewish descent Category:Drummers from San Francisco Category:Black Sabbath members Category:Faith No More members Category:The Ozzy Osbourne Band members Category:Alternative metal musicians Category:Musicians from San Francisco Category:20th-century American drummers Category:American male drummers ","title":"Mike Bordin"},{"id":"1437387","text":"Stephen Clarke (born 29 August 1963) is a Scottish professional football manager and former player who is the manager of the Scotland national team. Clarke played for St Mirren, Chelsea and the Scotland national team, winning three major trophies with Chelsea towards the end of his career. After retiring as a player, he moved into coaching and worked at Newcastle United, Chelsea, West Ham United and Liverpool. Clarke has since managed West Bromwich Albion and Reading. After a spell coaching at Aston Villa, Clarke was appointed Kilmarnock manager in October 2017. In May 2019, he was appointed manager of the Scottish national team. ==Playing career== ===St Mirren=== Clarke was born in Saltcoats in Ayrshire. His older brother Paul was a footballer, who played in more than 350 games for Kilmarnock. Spotted while playing for Beith Juniors, Steve began his professional career with St Mirren. Clarke was initially on a part-time contract with St Mirren, while he completed an apprenticeship as an instrument engineer. ===Chelsea=== Clarke was transferred to Chelsea for ¬£422,000 in February 1987. He stayed at Chelsea until 1998, making 421 appearances. He was a part of the Chelsea sides which won the 1997 FA Cup Final, 1998 Football League Cup Final and 1998 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final. The latter match, against VfB Stuttgart in Stockholm, was Clarke's final appearance for the club. In 2005, he was voted into Chelsea's centenary XI, occupying the right-back berth. Speaking in February 2019, Clarke said he was thankful that Chelsea had signed him as it meant that he and his family no longer had to live with religious sectarianism in the west of Scotland. ===Scotland=== Clarke made six appearances for the Scotland national team. His debut was a 2‚Äì0 friendly win over Hungary at Hampden Park on 9 September 1987, and his final game was a 3‚Äì1 friendly loss away to the Netherlands in Utrecht six years later on 27 May 1994. ==Coaching career== ===Newcastle United=== In 1998, Clarke joined Newcastle United as assistant manager to Ruud Gullit, his former manager at Chelsea. Clarke was part of the coaching team with Gullit, which helped Newcastle reach the 1999 FA Cup Final on 22 May 1999, where Newcastle finished runners up to Manchester United after goals from Teddy Sheringham and Paul Scholes in a 2‚Äì0 defeat. Clarke was caretaker manager following Gullit's resignation, taking charge of one match, a 5‚Äì1 defeat against Manchester United. For that match, Clarke reinstated Alan Shearer and Rob Lee to the team. ===Chelsea=== Clarke as assistant manager of Chelsea in 2007 After a stint in charge of the youth teams at Chelsea, Clarke was promoted to the position of assistant manager when Jos√© Mourinho was appointed manager in the summer of 2004. Clarke was a part of the coaching set-up which saw Chelsea win two FA Premier League titles, an FA Cup and two League Cups over three seasons under Mourinho. During this period, Clarke completed his UEFA Pro Licence in 2006. When Mourinho left Chelsea in September 2007, Clarke's services were retained by Avram Grant, although Henk ten Cate was brought in as another assistant coach. Both Grant and ten Cate left the club at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season. BBC Sport and The Times both reported then that although Clarke remained on the Chelsea coaching staff, he would be looking to pursue opportunities to become a manager in his own right. Chelsea assured Clarke of his status, citing his loyalty, popularity amongst the club's supporters and work in the aftermath of Mourinho's departure. ===West Ham United=== On 12 September 2008, Clarke handed in his resignation to Chelsea, hoping to move to West Ham United to be assistant to former Chelsea teammate Gianfranco Zola. Chelsea initially rejected his resignation, demanding compensation worth two years of Clarke's salary. After a deal was agreed between the clubs, Clarke became West Ham's first-team coach on 15 September. West Ham finished ninth in the Premier League in the 2008‚Äì09 season, earning Clarke and Zola extended contracts that made Clarke the highest paid assistant manager in the league. The club struggled during the next season, however, narrowly avoiding relegation. In June 2010, not long after the dismissal of Zola as manager, Clarke left the club by mutual consent. ===Liverpool=== On 10 January 2011, Clarke was appointed first-team coach at Liverpool by Kenny Dalglish, after Dalglish had replaced the dismissed Roy Hodgson two days before. Clarke was credited (alongside Dalglish) for turning Liverpool's season around, having a points average of around two points per match from his arrival, coupled with an improved defensive record. On 12 May 2011, Clarke, as well as manager Dalglish, signed a three-year contract to remain in his current role as first team coach. On 14 May 2012, Clarke offered his resignation to Liverpool following the sacking of manager Dalglish and Liverpool's eighth-place finish in the 2011‚Äì12 Premier League. The club declined the offer, but on 6 June 2012, following the appointment of new manager Brendan Rodgers, Clarke left the club. Clarke himself said that Liverpool sacked him. ===West Bromwich Albion=== On 8 June 2012, Clarke was appointed manager of West Bromwich Albion and signed a two- year contract. The job was Clarke's first permanent management role for any club, though during his time the club referred to him as \\"head coach\\". ====2012‚Äì13 season==== Albion began the Clarke era with a 3‚Äì0 home win against Liverpool on the opening day of the 2012‚Äì13 Premier League season. Clarke then followed that result up with a 1‚Äì1 away draw against Tottenham Hotspur, and a 2‚Äì0 win at home to Everton. Clarke suffered his first competitive defeat away at Fulham, but West Brom soon jumped back with 1‚Äì0 home victory over Reading. In November, the club won four consecutive matches in a row for the first time since 1980, defeating Southampton, Wigan Athletic, Chelsea and Sunderland. Clarke was named Premier League manager of the month for November 2012. Although the team would go on to lose their next three matches, Clarke's team would bounce back with a draw at home to West Ham and a 2‚Äì1 win over Norwich City. By Christmas 2012, West Brom were seventh in the table with 30 points, behind teams like Arsenal and Spurs only on goal difference. During the January transfer window, Clarke encountered some problems with want-away Nigerian Striker Peter Odemwingie, who desired a move to Queens Park Rangers, but West Brom refused to sell. Odemwingie was ultimately never sold and was later given time off following the transfer window saga. It was during this January period that the club struggled to emulate their early season form. Following a poor run of results which saw West Brom fail to win in six consecutive games, Clarke oversaw a 2‚Äì0 victory against Liverpool at Anfield, the club's first win since Boxing Day against QPR. West Brom won 3‚Äì0 at Southampton on 27 April, which was their 14th win of the season. This set club records for wins (14) and points (48) in a Premier League season. West Brom ended the season in style with a dramatic 5‚Äì5 draw with Manchester United, in what was Sir Alex Ferguson's final match as manager. The draw saw West Brom finish 8th in the table, their best finish since 1981. ====2013‚Äì14 season==== Clarke and West Brom returned for the new season with a 1‚Äì0 home loss to Southampton at The Hawthorns following a 90th-minute Rickie Lambert penalty. The team initially struggled to score goals, eventually recording their first league goal the fourth game of the new season when Gareth McAuley scored an injury time header in a 1‚Äì1 result against Fulham. 28 September 2013 saw them secure an historic 2‚Äì1 victory against league champions, Manchester United, their first win at Old Trafford in 35 years. Under his managership, however, they won only one further game, a 2‚Äì0 home defeat of Crystal Palace on 2 November 2013. On 9 November, West Brom were minutes away from securing a historic win at Stamford Bridge that would have ended Jos√© Mourinho's undefeated home record, but a controversial penalty decision ensured that the game ended 2‚Äì2. A further draw and four straight defeats followed and on 14 December 2013 Clarke was placed on gardening leave until May 2014, after a 1‚Äì0 loss at Cardiff City. This defeat had left the club two points above the relegation zone in 16th place. They had won 9 of the previous 41 Premier League matches. ===Reading=== On 16 December 2014, Clarke was appointed manager of Reading on a two-and-a-half-year deal, succeeding Nigel Adkins. On 16 March 2015, Clarke managed Reading to a 3‚Äì0 win against Bradford City in the FA Cup to reach their first semi-final for 88 years. In November 2015, Clarke was approached by Fulham to become their manager. Reading gave Clarke permission to speak to Fulham, but following the discussion he decided against taking the position. Clarke was sacked by Reading on 4 December 2015 after one year in charge. ===Aston Villa=== Clarke was hired by Aston Villa on 2 June 2016 to be their assistant manager, working alongside former Chelsea teammate Roberto Di Matteo. He was not retained following the appointment of Steve Bruce in October 2016. ===Kilmarnock=== After a year out of football, Clarke was appointed manager of Scottish Premiership club Kilmarnock on 14 October 2017. Kilmarnock was the club that Clarke had supported as a child. When he took over as manager, the club sat bottom of the league table. His first game as Kilmarnock manager, which was his first involvement in a Scottish club match for 30 years, ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Rangers. Three days later, Clarke's Kilmarnock side traveled to Celtic and once again gained a credible 1‚Äì1 draw. Following the league's winter break, Kilmarnock recorded a home victory over champions Celtic, with Youssouf Mulumbu scoring the only goal to inflict what was only the second domestic defeat on then Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers. Kilmarnock finished in fifth place, setting a new club record points tally of 59 in the process. Clarke was named the SFWA Manager of the Year for 2017‚Äì18. Clarke continued his impressive work the next season, culminating in a third- place finish and European qualification for Kilmarnock. He also won both manager of the year awards, from PFA Scotland and the SFWA. Clarke left Kilmarnock immediately after the league season ended to take the manager position with the Scotland national team. ===Scotland=== In May 2019, Clarke was appointed manager of the Scotland national team on a contract due to run until the end of 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification. On his debut on 8 June, the Scots won 2‚Äì1 at home to Cyprus in UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying.

The GP is converted to D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) using the energy in ATP and the reducing power of NADPH as part of the Calvin cycle. This returns ADP, phosphate ions Pi, and NADP+ to the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis for their continued function. RuBP is regenerated for the Calvin cycle to continue. G3P is generally considered the prime end-product of photosynthesis and it can be used as an immediate food nutrient, combined and rearranged to form monosaccharide sugars, such as glucose, which can be transported to other cells, or packaged for storage as insoluble polysaccharides such as starch. ===Balance sheet=== 6 CO2 \\\\+ 6 RuBP (+ energy from 12 ATP and 12 NADPH) ‚Üí12 G3P (3-carbon) 10 G3P (+ energy from 6 ATP) ‚Üí 6 RuBP (i.e. starting material regenerated) 2 G3P ‚Üí glucose (6-carbon). ==In tryptophan biosynthesis== Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate occurs as a byproduct in the biosynthesis pathway of tryptophan, an essential amino acid that cannot be produced by the human body. ==In thiamine biosynthesis== Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate occurs as a reactant in the biosynthesis pathway of thiamine (Vitamin B1), another substance that cannot be produced by the human body == References == == External links == * D-Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and the reactions and pathways it participates in, from the KEGG PATHWAY Database * Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and the reactions and pathways it participates in, from the KEGG PATHWAY Database Category:Photosynthesis Category:Organophosphates Category:Phosphate esters ","title":"Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate"},{"id":"1437419","text":"Thekla (, Th√©kla, ) is a Greek feminine given name made famous by Saint Thecla, a 1st-century Christian martyr.

The earliest record of her life comes from the ancient apocryphal Acts of Paul and Thecla. ==Church tradition== The Acts of Paul and Thecla is a 2nd-century text (circa AD 180) which forms part of the Acts of Paul but also circulated separately. According to the text, Thecla was a young noble virgin from Iconium who listened to Paul's \\"discourse on virginity\\", espoused the teachings and became estranged to both her fianc√©, Thamyris, and her mother. She sat by her window for three days, listening to St. Paul and his teachings. When they witnessed this, they became concerned that Thecla would follow Paul's demand \\"one must fear only one God and live in chastity\\" and turned to the authorities to punish both Paul and Thecla. Thecla was miraculously saved from burning at the stake by the onset of a storm and traveled with Paul to Antioch of Pisidia. There, a nobleman named Alexander desired Thecla and attempted to rape her. Thecla fought him off, tearing his cloak and knocking his coronet off his head in the process. She was put on trial for assault. She was sentenced to be eaten by wild beasts but was again saved by a series of miracles, when the female beasts (lionesses in particular) protected her against her male aggressors. While in the arena, she baptized herself by throwing herself into a nearby lake full of aggressive seals.J K Elliott, \\"Graphic Versions: Did non-biblical stories about Jesus and the saints originate more in art than text?\\", Times Literary Supplement, 14 December 2018, pp. 15-16.Snyder, G.

She rejoined the Holy Apostle Paul in Myra, traveled to preach the word of God and became an icon encouraging women to imitate her by living a life of chastity and following the word of the Lord.Osiek, Carolyn. 'The Cult Of Thecla: A Tradition Of Women's Piety In Late Antiquity (Review)'. Journal of Early Christian Studies 11.3 (2003): 422-424. Web. She went to live in Seleucia Cilicia. According to some versions of the Acts, she lived in a cave there for 72 years. However, she passed the rest of her life in Maaloula, a village in Syria. She became a healer, performed many miracles, but remained constantly persecuted. The story goes, as her persecutors were about to get her, she called out to God and a new passage was opened in the cave, and the stones closed behind her. The passage and caves are still found in Maaloula which became a very important site for pilgrims. She was able to go to Rome and lie down beside Paul's tomb. ==Traditions and interpretations== The Church Fathers recount a number of traditions about Thecla. Gregory of Nyssa writes in the 4th century (Homily 14 in Cant) that she undertook the sacrifice of herself, by giving death to the flesh [Gal 5:24], practicing great austerities, extinguishing in herself all earthly affections, so that nothing seemed to remain living in her but reason and spirit: the whole world seemed dead to her as she was to the world [Gal 6:14]. Macarius Magnes shortly after AD 300 wrote how the message of Christianity was \\"the Sword, [Matt 10:34] which cuts relations from each other [Matt:10:35], as it cut Thecla from Theocleia.\\" [Apocriticus ii.7]. Around AD 280, Thecla features as one of the characters in Methodius of Olympus' Symposium, in which we learn that she was well versed in profane philosophy, and various branches of literature, of eloquent yet modest discourse. He says that she received her instruction in divine and evangelical knowledge from Paul, and was eminent for her skill in sacred science (\\"Logos 8\\"). The martyrdom of Thecla is frequently referred to in the earliest Acts of the Martyrs. Eugenius, a martyr of Trebizond under Diocletian (284‚Äì305), couples Thecla with David and Daniel in his prayers. The exordium of the Acts of Polyeuctes [d. 259] refers to Thecla and Perpetua, and there were certainly many virgin martyrs who drew their first inspiration from the same source. Eugenia of Rome in the reign of Commodus (180‚Äì192) is reported in the Acts of her martyrdom to have taken Thecla as her model. Paul is also an ambiguous figure in the Acts of Paul and Thecla. He is seen as a preacher of asceticism, but one with whom women are besotted. His teachings lead Thecla into trouble, and yet he is never there when the trouble comes. This presentation of Paul as ascetic preacher, discouraging marriage, appears to be very different from that of the Pastoral Epistles. For instance, 1st Timothy 4:1‚Äì3 has Paul explicitly condemning anyone who forbids marriage. However, 1st Corinthians 7 is more ambivalent about marriage, saying that \\"it is well for a man not to touch a woman\\" (7:1). This text has been interpreted as ideologically closer to Paul and Thecla. In any event, Paul and Thecla indicates one possible understanding of Paul's legacy in the second century. ==Veneration== St. Thecla Shrine. Latakia, Syria In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the wide circulation of the Acts of Paul and Thecla is evidence of her veneration. She was called \\"apostle and protomartyr among women\\" and \\"equal-to-apostles in sanctity\\". She was widely cited as an ascetic role model for women. During the fourth and fifth centuries, Thecla was lauded in literature as an exemplary virgin and martyr by ascetic writers and theologians such as Methodius of Olympus, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus. The Eastern Rites of the Eastern Orthodox Church commemorate her on 24 September in churches following the new Calendar and 7 October for those using the old or Julian Calendar. Her veneration flourished particularly at Seleucia Cilicia (where she was said to have lived to old age and be buried), Iconium (present day Konya), and Nicomedia. The society also appeared at least as early as the 4th century in Western Europe. Chamali√®res in France was believed to hold relics. The obscure saints, Tecla of Aquileia and of Trieste are modeled after her. In Bede's martyrology, Thecla is celebrated on 23 September, which was her feast day in the West, though in 1969 the Roman Catholic Church removed Thecla's feast day from the Calendar of Saints for lack of historic evidence. The Western Rite Parishes of the Orthodox Churches continue to celebrate her on 23 September (new Calendar Parishes) and 6 October (old Calendar Churches). A local martyr tradition of Thecla may have inspired an episode connected to Paul the Apostle. \\"It is otherwise difficult to account for the very great popularity of the cult of St. Thecla, which spread over East and West, and made her the most famous of virgin martyrs,\\" wrote M. R. James, the editor of this Acta (James 1924). ===Tomb of Saint Thecla, Silifke=== Aya Thekla in Seleucia The cave-tomb in Seleucia was one of the most celebrated in the Christian world. Gregory of Nazianzus withdrew to the shrine of 'the highly praised young maid Thecla'De vita sua, 548‚Äì9. for three years. The site was described by Egeria in the mid-380s. It was restored several times, among others by the Emperor Zeno in the 5th century, and today the ruins of the tomb and sanctuary are called Aya Tekla Church or Meriamlik.(Denkschriften der k. Akadem. der Wissenschaft. philos.-histor. Klasse, Vienna, XLIV, 6, 105-08) A 5th century anonymous work, The Life and Miracles of Thecla concentrates on the town. ===Tomb of Saint Thecla, Maaloula=== Convent of St. Thecla in Maaloula. In Maaloula, Syria, a Greek Orthodox nunnery, the Convent of Saint Thecla, was built near her cave tomb, reached by steps in the mountainside, a pilgrimage site with a holy well. The Church tradition is that the mountain opened miraculously to protect Thecla from her persecutors. On Monday, December 2, 2013, during the Syrian civil war, twelve nuns there were seized by Al-Qaeda radicals of Al-Nusra Front during the bombardment of her shrine. Three months later the nuns were exchanged for relatives of terrorists. In April 2014, the town was liberated by Syrian governmental troops. On May 30, 2018, the rector of the Church Ilias Ades announced the Monastery would be entirely restored in a month by the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch with help from the Russian Orthodox Church. The Monastery is a popular destination for Eastern Orthodox Christians from around the world, including Russia. === Monastery of Saint Tecla, Larnaca === According to tradition, empress Helena founded the monastery of Saint Tecla that is located in Mosfiloti near Larnaca. After the Mamluks had taken control of Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, part of the hallows of Saint Thecla were carried to Cyprus by Christians. The hallows are in this monastery now.–ú–æ–Ω–∞—Å—Ç—ã—Ä—å –°–≤—è—Ç–æ–π –ü–µ—Ä–≤–æ–º—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –§–µ–∫–ª—ã –±–ª–∏–∑ –õ–∞—Ä–Ω–∞–∫–∏ === St. Menas in Cyprus === An inscription in remembrance \\"of the martyr Thecla\\" in the church of St. Menas in Cyprus, and dated to the second half of the 1st century, was interpreted in the early twentieth century as evidence for her historical existence.Ernst Sittig, ŒëœÅœá. ŒïœÜ. 1914, mentioned in American Journal of Archaeology, 1915, p. 489 At this pilgrimage site near The Church of St. Menas in Cyprus, women had the option to buy a flask which they could fill with holy water, oil, even dirt from that stop which many women visited during their pilgrimage. These flasks depict the image of Menas on one side and Thecla on the other side.Davis, Stephen J. The Cult Of Saint Thecla. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001. Print. ===Catacomb of Saint Tecla, Rome=== In June 2010, on a wall of the Catacomba di Santa Tecla in Rome, Vatican archaeologists of the Pontifical Commission for Sacred Archaeology, using laser technology to remove layers of clay and lime rind, discovered a frescoed portrait of St Paul the Apostle, \\"recognizable by his thin face and dark pointed beard...with small eyes and furrowed brow,\\" Biblical Archaeology Review, Jan/Feb 2010, Vol 36 No 1, p. 18: Found in Vatican: Paul's Portrait which they believe is the oldest image in existence of Paul, dating from the late 4th century. === The Movement of St. Thecla and Women's Empowerment === St. Thecla, with her dedication and image of a chosen saint started a following of masses of women across Asia Minor and Egypt. St. Thecla was praised among these women as a sort of patron of empowerment for women: in the Acts of Paul and Thecla, St. Thecla preached to men, and baptized herself, all things that were normally supposed to have only been done by men. St. Thecla created a culture of imitation in these women. Several of them would live as virgins in households, in tombs (as she was rumored to do), and sometimes in monasteries. These women would travel together as bands of empowered virgins telling stories of Thecla and her grace. Other women in the Movement of St. Thecla would name their daughters after her, engrave her face on their tombsll of these women were empowered by Thecla, a woman who did things that not many women would ever dare to do, and they built a strong community in which they empowered each other. ==Patronage== She is sometimes counted as the patron saint of Tarragona in Catalonia (Spain), where the cathedral has a chapel dedicated to her. Her feast day remains the town's major local holiday. In Spanish-speaking countries, she is also facetiously counted as the patron saint of computers and Internet, from the homophony with the Spanish and Catalan word tecla (\\"key\\"). The earliest cathedral in Milan was also dedicated to her; its baptistry and remnants of its structure are still accessible below the present structure. The duomo of the town of Este, Veneto is dedicated to Santa Tecla. Lebanon has 42 churches dedicated to St Takla or Taqla. One of the oldest is the St Taqla Church in Masqa, Matn District; built in 1695. The church boasts an 1870 painting of Thecla by the Italian artist Vincento Lampodico. In Syria, there is a Greek-Orthodox church of St Thecla in Darayya. In 1849, some people found a cave in Latakia in which it later became St. Taqla's Shrine. In the United States there are three Roman Catholic parishes named for Saint Thecla: in Clinton, Michigan; in Pembroke, Massachusetts; and in Chicago, Illinois. Several cities and towns are named for her: * Santa Tecla, formerly Nuevo San Salvador, in La Libertad, El Salvador * Sainte-Th√®cle, Quebec, Canada * The hamlet of Sainte-Th√®cle in the commune of Peillon, Alpes-Maritimes, France * Santa Tecla, a quarter (frazione) of Acireale, Italy * Santa Tecla de Basto, a quarter (freguesia) of Celorico de Basto, Portugal * The neighbourhood of Leipzig Thekla in Leipzig, Germany *The village of Llandegla, Denbighshire, Wales *Deir Taqla (Monastery of Thecla), South Lebanon ==See also== * Aya Tekla Church, an ancient church in Mersin Province, Turkey. * Leucius Charinus * Santa Tecla, El Salvador * Santa Tecla Festival * Sainte-Th√®cle, Quebec, in Canada *List of Christian women of the patristic age ==Bibliography== *Barrier, J.
