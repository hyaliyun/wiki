He was bred by J. D. Barton of Anthony, New Mexico and raced under his Double B. Ranch colors in a three-way partnership with Dr. Joseph Kidd and James Howard.Bold Ego's pedigree ==Racing career== At age two in 1980, Bold Ego raced primarily at racetracks in New Mexico for trainer Clifford Lambert, where he won his first five races before finishing third in the Hollywood Juvenile Championship Stakes at Hollywood Park Racetrack in Inglewood, California.The Oxnard, California Press-Courier - July 20, 1980 He ended the year having won seven of eight starts but had never been tested beyond six furlongs.Schenectady Gazette (New York) - Apr 13, 1981 Partway into the 1981 racing season, Lambert stepped down as trainer and recommended that the owners contact trainer Jack Van Berg. The future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame trainer inductee agreed to take over the conditioning of Bold Ego, so the horse was shipped to Van Berg's stable at Oaklawn Park Race Track. Under Van Berg and assistant trainer Dennis Werre, Bold Ego won Oaklawn's Southwest and Rebel Stakes followed by the prestigious Arkansas Derby, a win that propelled him into the U.S. Triple Crown picture.Youngstown Vindicator (Ohio) - April 12, 1981 === Triple Crown races === Bold Ego went into the 1981 Kentucky Derby having won more races (10) and more purse money ($382,676) than any other entry.Boston Globe - April 30, 1981 A frontrunner who was always difficult to rate, in the Derby Bold Ego got into a speed duel for the lead with Top Avenger and tired himself out by running the fastest times in the history of the race for the first quarter and first half. He finished tenth. His connections felt that Bold Ego was much better than his performance in the Derby portrayed, so they shipped him to Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, to run in the second jewel of the Triple Crown: the $1,000,000 Grade 1 Preakness Stakes. In the 106th running of the Preakness, Bold Ego was listed on the morning line as the 7-2 second favorite in the field of thirteen colts. In the mile and a sixteenth race, he broke well in second place under new jockey John Lively. Going into Pimlico's famous \\"Clubhouse Turn,\\" Bold Ego took the lead by a length. The pace was extremely fast, with the first quarter in :23-4/5 and the first half in :47-3/5. Bold Ego led down the backstretch and around the final turn in a quick mile in 1:36-2/5. At the top of the lane, he was challenged by the Kentucky Derby winner, Pleasant Colony. In the final sixteenth, both colts were set down to a hard drive with Bold Ego being urged with right-hand crosses by Lively and Pleasant Colony being urged strongly with left-handed whips. Pleasant Colony won by 3/4 of a length, and 75-1 longshot Paristo finished two lengths behind Bold Ego in third.Lakeland Ledger (Florida) - June 3, 1981 In the Belmont Stakes, Bold Ego was part of a pack of four leaders through the first half mile but dropped out of contention by the three-quarters mark and finished eleventh and last.The Dubuque, Iowa Telegraph-Herald - June 7, 1981 == Later career== Bold Ego won four races at age four and was retired to stud duty having earned more than half a million dollars in racing.

The group consisted of vocalist Bobbie Eakes, bassist Julia Farey, keyboardist Rebecca Ryan and drummer Suzy Zarow. Eakes was originally Miss Georgia in 1983. After deciding on all band members except the vocalist, Silverman auditioned approximately five hundred vocalists, where Eakes was the one to win the part. The band made their start on the Mack & Jamie comedy show, while they would often appear as the \\"house band\\" on the series Comedy Break, where Eakes would occasionally appear as a performer in the sketches. The band signed to Epic Records in 1987, and recorded their first single - a Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock track titled \\"All I Need Is You\\". It was released as a promotional single, and featured in the film Over the Top, starring Sylvester Stallone. The song was included on the official soundtrack release, which was released during the same year. The band then recorded their self-titled album Big Trouble which was released in 1988. The album was produced by Grammy and Oscar winner Giorgio Moroder, while various other producers featured on certain tracks alongside him. Moroder co-wrote both album tracks that were released as singles. Today, the album, although on CD and vinyl, has remained out-of-print. Big Trouble had one chart entry in America, the single \\"Crazy World\\", released in 1987. The song, written by Moroder and Whitlock, peaked at No. 71. A music video was filmed for the song. A second single followed in 1988, the Moroder-Whitlock song \\"When the Love Is Good\\", which was also taken from the self-titled album, and featured the non- album b-side \\"Last Kiss\\". The song failed to make any impact in America, although it peaked at No. 83 in the UK. A music video was filmed for the song. The band's final release was the 1988 CD maxi-single \\"Crazy World\\", released in the UK only, which was backed by the two album tracks \\"Say Yes\\" and \\"Trains and Boats and Planes\\". The release attempted to follow the minor success of the previous single, where it peaked at No. 96. As a result of the small success, the group dissolved soon after. Following the band's split, Eakes, previously an actress, would win the role of Macy Alexander on the soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful, which she played from 1989 to 2000. She returned to music in 1994 with a duet album with Jeff Tracta, titled Bold and Beautiful Duets, which went double-platinum in Europe. Another collaboration with Tracta followed in 1998, with the album Glamour Duets II. Two solo albums followed, the 1998 album Here and Now, as well as the 2005 album Something Beautiful. Bassist Julia Farey would later replace the bassist of another all-female rock band Precious Metal. With that band, she would record their third and final album Precious Metal, released in 1990. In an interview with two members Mara Fox and Leslie Knauer, it was stated that Farey was found by the band the same way they had started the band, through musicians wanted ads in the local papers. Both the keyboardist Rebecca Ryan and drummer Suzy Zarow disappeared from the public eye after the band's split. Ryan eventually became a solo artist during the 90s and recorded two albums at the turn of the 21st century, mainly focusing on jazz and pop standards. Former guitarist Heli Sterner was later an inaugural member of another outfit, Rachel Rachel, which became the first all-female group in the history of the contemporary Christian music genre. Rachel Rachel is also defunct. ==Members== ;Final lineup *Bobbie Eakes - lead and backing vocals (1986-1988) *Julia Farey - bass guitar, backing vocals (1985-1988) *Rebecca Ryan - keyboards, keytar, piano, backing and lead vocals (1985-1988) *Suzy Zarow - drums, backing vocals (1985-1988) ;Past members *Bess Motta - lead and backing vocals (1985-1986) *Heli Sterner - guitar, backing and lead vocals (1985-1986) *Cece Worrall - saxophone, flute, tambourine, backing vocals (1985-1986) ==Discography== ;Studio albums *Big Trouble (1988) ;Singles *\\"All I Need Is You\\" (1987) *\\"Crazy World\\" (1987) *\\"When the Love Is Good\\" (1988) *\\"Crazy World\\" (1988) ==References== Category:Musical groups established in 1985 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1988 Category:Epic Records artists Category:Musical quartets Category:American pop rock music groups Category:American pop girl groups Category:All-female bands Category:1985 establishments in the United States ","title":"Big Trouble (band)"},{"id":"35884451","text":"Rudolf Reiff (1901–1961) was a German stage and film actor. ==Selected filmography== * Tonelli (1943) * Freunde (1945) * Encounter with Werther (1949) * The Great Mandarin (1949) * Doctor Praetorius (1950) * Trouble in Paradise (1950) * Two in One Suit (1950) * Immortal Light (1951) * The House in Montevideo (1951) * The Great Temptation (1952) * Music by Night (1953) * The Bird Seller (1953) * Heartbroken on the Moselle (1953) * The Chaplain of San Lorenzo (1953) ==External links== * Category:1901 births Category:1961 deaths Category:German male film actors Category:German male stage actors Category:Actors from Leipzig Category:20th-century German male actors ","title":"Rudolf Reiff"},{"id":"35884462","text":"Jordi Arrese was the defending champion, but lost in the quarterfinals this year.

ISSN 0891-1851 The R-120 is a development of the Bushcaddy R-80 and is supplied as a kit for amateur construction. ==Design and development== The aircraft was designed to comply with the Canadian and United States amateur-built aircraft rules. It features a strut-braced high-wing, a two- seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit, fixed tricycle landing gear or conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. The R-120 is structurally strengthened over the R-80 to allow a higher gross weight and accept larger engines. The aircraft is made from 6061-T6 aluminum sheet over a cage of welded aluminum square 6061-T6 aluminum tube. The tail boom is conventional semi-monocoque construction. The non- tapered planform wings have 6061-T6 ribs and spars and employ a NACA 4413 (mod) airfoil. The airfoil modification removes the undercamber on the bottom of the wing, which makes construction easier, without giving up low speed performance. The aircraft's structure uses 2024-T3 aluminium for critical parts where extra strength is required, such as the spar, float and strut attachments as well as other critical components like the rudder horns. The R-120's structure is covered with 6061-T6 sheet of varying thicknesses. The wings are supported by conventional \\"V\\" struts. 6061-T6 is predominantly used for its lower cost and also its better corrosion resistance, since many R-120s are flown on floats.

She spent much of her later life promoting the work of her mother, Bronislava Nijinska, the dancer and choreographer.W. J. Weatherby, 'Defender of the dance', The Guardian, 6 July 1991 Irina Nijinska was born in St Petersburg, the daughter of Nijinska and dancer Alexander Kotchetovsky. Her uncle was the world famous dancer Vaslav Nijinsky; and her grandparents were dancers Thomas Nijinsky and Eleanora Bereda. After her brother Leo was born in Kiev in 1919, her parents separated. Her mother took her two children west in 1921, eventually settling in France. She trained as a dancer in Paris, studying with Vera Trefilova and Eugene Lapitsky, and beginning pointe work with her grandmother. Irina made her debut with Olga Spessivtzeva's troupe in 1930. She went on to dance in many of the dance troupes with which her mother was associated, performing under the stage name Irina Istomina. Among other parts, she performed her mother's old role as the Street Dancer in Petrouchka. Like her relatives, she became known for the height of her jumps. In 1935 she was forced to interrupt her dancing career after suffering injuries in a car accident that killed her brother, Leo. During her convalescence, Irina first became an assistant to her mother,, helping to stage the ballet Les Noces for Col. de Basil's Ballets Russes, in New York in 1936; and the ballet Le Baiser de la Fée in Buenos Aires. Much later, she helped her mother revive \\"Les Biches\\" for the Teatro dell'Opera in Rome in 1969; and for the Teatro Comunale in Florence in 1970. Mother and daughter moved to Los Angeles in 1940, where both began teaching.Anderson (1991).Los Angeles Times obituary. She taught at Nijinska's Hollywood Dance Studio from 1941-1950. Following her mother's death in 1972, Irina co-edited and co-translated the first part of Bronislava's autobiography,, Early Memoirs, with Jean Rawlinson. She made the publishing arrangements and it appeared in 1981, being named a Notable Book of 1981 by the American Library Association. She also continued working with the revivals of Bronislava's original choreographies, produced at different ballet-company venues.See article Bronislava Nijinska, ∮∮ 4.8.4, 5.2, & 7.3. By her own estimate, between 1972 and 1991 Irina Nijinska produced 26 stagings for 20 different ballet companies in Europe, America, and Asia. Oakland Ballet's production of \\"Les Noces\\" in 1981 saw the first American performances of Nijinska's ballet since 1936. Irina also staged Les Biches for Oakland Ballet in 1982; and assisted Frank W.D. Ries, a Jean Cocteau scholar, in the reconstruction of Le Train Bleu in Oakland, in 1989. She developed close ties with the Dance Theatre of Harlem, in New York, where she staged \\"Les Biches\\" in 1983, and in 1989 staged a full evening of works by Bronislava Nijinska including \\"Les Biches,\\" \\"Les Noces,\\" and \\"Rondo Capriccioso,\\" the latter reconstructed with the assistance of Rosella Hightower. Irina's staging of \\"Les Noces\\" for the Feld Ballet, in 1985, was notable for the design of a new set by Ming Cho Lee. In 1990, Irina revived the Bride's Variation from \\"Le Baiser de la Fée\\" for a conference sponsored by the Dance Critics Association. That performance featured a young Jennie Somogyi, later a principal dancer with New York City Ballet. Irina Nijinska was also instrumental in promoting her mother's works through her involvement in two historic museum exhibitions. \\"Bronislava Nijinska: a Dancer's Legacy,\\" was curated by Nancy Van Norman Baer and first seen at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York, from March to July of1986, then at the California Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco, from September 1986 to January 1987. \\"La Nijinska: Choreographer, Dancer, Teacher\\" was curated by Madeleine Nichols and exhibited at the Dance Collection of the New York Public Library, from December 1990 through April 1991, commemorating the 100th anniversary of Bronislava Nijinska's birth. In 1946 Irina had married Gibbs S. Raetz; they had two children, Natalie and George. In 1991 at age 77, Irina Nijinska died in a hospital room in Inglewood after suffering a stroke on May 29, in Amsterdam.Anderson (1991).Los Angeles Times obituary.

It starred Jerzy Stuhr, Izabella Olszewska, and Jerzy Trela. Based on a story by Lech Borski and a screenplay by Kieślowski and Jerzy Stuhr, the film is about a young man who leaves prison after a three-year sentence seeking to start a new life. His dreams of a better life are broken, however, when he is forced into a conflict between a corrupt construction company boss and his fellow workers who go on strike. The Calm was filmed on location in KrakówKieślowski (1998) p. 247. and completed in 1976, but was banned by the state because of its subject matter—strikes were illegal in Poland during that time.Innsdorf (1999) p. 40.

In 1981, The Calm received the Polish Film Festival Special Jury Prize. ==Plot== A young man in Poland, Antek Gralak (Jerzy Stuhr), is released from prison after serving a three-year sentence. Leaving his home town of Kraków, Antek heads for a construction site in Silesia where he is not known. He dreams of living a simple life, with a job, a wife, and home. In Silesia he is anxious to avoid trouble and is friendly with his colleagues and grateful to his employer for hiring him. Antek meets a nice young woman, falls in love, and gets married. His joyful new life is soon interrupted, however, when he becomes involved in a conflict at work. Construction materials have disappeared and Antek's boss, who is involved in the theft, deducts the loss from the workers' wages. Thinking he can trust Antek, the boss tries to get him involved in his underhanded deals. Soon a strike breaks out among the workers. Torn between his boss and his coworkers, Antek, who is only interested in finding peace, shows up for work. Believing Antek to be in league with their corrupt boss, the striking workers beat him up as he mutters, \\"Calm ... calm ...\\" ==Cast== * Jerzy Stuhr as Antek Gralak * Izabella Olszewska * Jerzy Trela * Jan Adamski * Marian Cebulski * Edward Dobrzanski * Ryszard Dreger * Jerzy Fedorowicz * Stanislaw Gronkowski * Elzbieta Karkoszka * Stanislaw Marczewski * Stefan Mienicki * Jan Nizinski * Ryszard Palik * Danuta Ruksza * Janusz Sykutera * Feliks Szajnert * Michal Szulkiewicz * Grzegorz Warchol * Ferdynand Wójcik * Michal Zarnecki ==ReceptionAwards and nominations=== * 1981 Polish Film Festival Special Jury Prize (Krzysztof Kieslowski) Won ==References== ;Notes ;Citations ;Bibliography * * ==External links== * Category:1980 films Category:Films directed by Krzysztof Kieślowski Category:Polish films Category:Films with screenplays by Krzysztof Kieślowski ","title":"The Calm (film)"},{"id":"35884696","text":"Sun Jiagu (孫家穀; Sun Chia-ku in Wade Giles) was a native of Anhui who graduated as jinshi in the 1856 and was a senior clerk in the Zongli Yamen when appointed in 1869 to be Co-Envoy with Anson Burlingame, then United States Minister at Beijing, on a friendly mission to foreign countries.

Bravo was the person who made the phenomenon of sleeping sharks known to the world. ==Biography== Bravo was born in Piedras Negras, Coahuila in northern Mexico from his parents Juan Bravo, a railroader, and María del Rosario Prieto. Bravo was first known as a famous Mexican swimmer and competed in the 1948 Summer Olympics. Also played as Wide Receiver in UNAM football team. Thanks to his close friend Apolonio Castillo in the late 50s, Bravo began to dedicate himself to diving and underwater photography– gaining him fame in both in the United States and Europe as an oceanographer. Bravo developed a fascination for sharks and devoted a large portion of his life to filming and studying sharks. He is widely known for the discovery, study, and photography of \\"sleeping sharks\\" near Isla Mujeres in the Caribbean where sharks were seen there to be \\"sleeping\\" on the ocean floor. Bravo was the first person to dive and film with orcas in their natural state without a protective cage in the frosty waters of Islas San Benito in Baja California, Mexico or polar bears swimming at the North Pole, where even one bit his left heel. ===The sleeping sharks=== It was Ramón Bravo in the 1970s, who made known to the world how sharks sleep, after the lobster fisherman Carlos García, nicknamed \\"Válvula\\" (the \\"Valve\\" in English), discovered them in a place known as \\"Los Cuevones\\" (The big caves). At first Bravo did not believe \\"Válvula\\" because scientists said that sharks could not sleep, that they must be constantly moving because they lacked a swim bladder he initially thought that they were harmless nurse shark crawling on the sand, but due to the insistence of \\"Vávula\\", finally Bravo went to verify the discovery of the fisherman then he verified and filmed that tiger, mako, whitetip or bull sharks rested peacefully on the white sands in caves of the Caribbean Sea and, later, shared the discovery with Dr. Eugenie Clark, a member of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of La Joya, California. Dr. Clark's scientific explanation was: Bravo also served as guide and cameraman to Jacques-Yves Cousteau, his son Philippe and his divers of the Calypso, into the cave of sleeping sharks and reefs surrounding Isla Mujeres resulted in a documentary called, The Sleeping Sharks of Yucatan where Ramón Bravo appears in the credits.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryBhIJXiRlc The investigations of Ramón Bravo were not without dangers, since on more than one occasion he was injured by the sharks he used to film. One of them (a bull shark) bit him, causing a serious injury to his left forearm, at the elbow, which required urgent surgery and intensive care for several weeks. Cousteau Also a well- known journalist and writer during the mid-1960s and 1970s, he wrote, among others, the following novels and works: * Primero y touch, segundo y muerte (1961) * Bajo las aguas del Mar Rojo (1962) * Isla Mujeres (1972) * Holbox (1974) * Tintorera (1975) * Buceando entre Tiburones (1975) * El cenote de la muerte (1976) * El cisne negro (1976) * Un tesoro bajo el mar (1977) * Carnada (1978) * Buceando en el Polo Norte (1979) * Un tesoro bajo el mar (1979) * Buceando entre las Orcas (1982) * La siesta del tiburón (1984) * Sirenia (1987) * El Chinchorro (not completed, about the protected zone of Mahahual) One of his novels later became a film called Tintorera (1977) directed by René Cardona Jr. The underwater photography was by Ramón Bravo. He also photographed and directed underwater scenes of the James Bond movie Licence to Kill (1989) starring Timothy Dalton. Although uncredited, Bravo played the zombie that fought the tiger shark underwater in Lucio Fulci's Zombi 2 after René Cardona Jr. stepped down. The shark was fed prior to filming as well as pumped with tranquilizers to keep it placid. ==Death== Ramón Bravo died on 21 February 1998 by accident, because of a heart attack caused by an electric shock from his home in Isla Mujeres. On February 28, 1998, in the presence of the then President of Mexico, Ernesto Zedillo, Jean-Michel Cousteau and many local and State authorities, at the entrance to the underwater cave of the Sleeping Sharks, located between Isla Contoy and Isla Mujeres, in Quintana Roo, Mexico. Ramón's wife, María Vallejo and priest Eduardo Pérez deposited their his and, at the entrance, a bronze plaque was placed in his honor at the wish of his dearest friends and many famous divers, which says: ==References * Category:1925 births Category:1998 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Coahuila Category:Male freestyle swimmers Category:Olympic swimmers of Mexico Category:Swimmers at the 1948 Summer Olympics Category:Mexican scientists Category:Mexican ecologists Category:Oceanographers Category:Mexican journalists Category:Male journalists Category:20th-century Mexican writers Category:20th-century Mexican male writers Category:Central American and Caribbean Games gold medalists for Mexico Category:Competitors at the 1946 Central American and Caribbean Games Category:Competitors at the 1950 Central American and Caribbean Games Category:Central American and Caribbean Games medalists in swimming Category:20th-century journalists ","title":"Ramón Bravo"},{"id":"35884781","text":"' (I love the Highest with my entire being), 174', is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. Bach composed the cantata in Leipzig for the second day of Pentecost and first performed it on 6 June 1729. == History and words == Bach wrote the cantata in Leipzig for Pentecost Monday. The prescribed readings for the feast day were from the Acts of the Apostles, the sermon of Peter for Cornelius (), and from the Gospel of John, \\"God loved the world so much ...\\" from the meeting of Jesus and Nicodemus (). The cantata text was written by Picander and published in his collection of cantata texts for a year in 1728. Picander had written in the preface that he hoped \\"the lack of poetic elegance would be compensated for by the sweetness of the incomparable Bach, and that these songs will be sung in the main churches of devout Leipzig.\\" Nine of Bach's cantatas on his texts in that volume are extant. If Bach composed more, they are lost. In the first aria the poet considers the beginning of the gospel, \\" ...\\" (For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life), and concludes that the Christian owes love to God in return for God's love. The gospel word is quoted and reflected in the following recitative. The last aria addresses the congregation to seize the salvation offered by God's love. The closing chorale is the first stanza of Martin Schalling's hymn \\"\\", expressing love for God. For the opening Sinfonia, Bach added parts to a movement from his Brandenburg Concerto No. 3. He could employ many players as he had started to direct a , a (an association of musically inclined burghers) who played his church music as well. Bach first performed the cantata on 6 June 1729; he noted the year in the score. == Scoring and structure == The cantata in five movements is \\"lavishly scored\\" for the feast day, for three soloists, alto, tenor and bass, a four-part choir only in the chorale, two corni da caccia, two oboes, taille (tenor oboe), three solo violins, three solo violas, three solo cellos and basso continuo. # Sinfonia # Aria (alto): # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (bass): # Chorale: == Music == The cantata begins with a Sinfonia, which Bach derived from the first movement of his Brandenburg Concerto No. 3, possibly composed already in Weimar. For the cantata, he added to the nine string parts two new parts for corno da caccia and a ripieno trio of oboe I and violin I, oboe II and violin II, taille and viola, parts that are also new, but reinforcing existing parts. John Eliot Gardiner hears in the result the addition of \\"new-minted sheen and force to the original concerto movement, its colours and rhythms even sharper than before\\". In the first aria, two obbligato oboes in imitation introduce themes which the voice picks up. \\"Gently rocking siciliano melodies, expressing spiritual tranquillity and compassion\\" appear in extended ritornellos. The recitative is accompanied by three upper string parts, similar to the original Brandenburg concerto movement. In the second aria, the violins and violas are combined to an obbligato part, \\"whose 'knocking' motif of repeated notes insistently underlines the urgency of the text\\". The cantata is closed by a four-part chorale setting of the well-known melody which Bach used to conclude his St John Passion with the third stanza, \\"\\". == Recordings == * Die Bach Kantate Vol. 5, Helmuth Rilling, Gächinger Kantorei, Bach-Collegium Stuttgart, Julia Hamari, Aldo Baldin, Wolfgang Schöne, Hänssler 1984 * J.

It is defined as being incapable of enjoying one’s own possessions and other material objects, clinging to them and being unwilling to part with them or share them with others.Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 893-894.Kunsang (2004), p. 25. It is identified as: * One of the twenty subsidiary unwholesome mental factors within the Mahayana Abhidharma teachings. * One of the fourteen unwholesome mental factors within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings. * One of the ten fetters in the Theravada tradition (according to the Dhammasangani) ==DefinitionsTheravada=== The Atthasālinī (II, Book I, Part IX, Chapter II, 257) gives the following definition of avarice (meanness): : It has, as characteristic, the concealing of one's property, either attained or about to be attained; the not enduring the sharing of one's property in common with others, as function; the shrinking from such sharing or niggardliness or sour feeling as manifestation; one's own property as proximate cause; and it should be regarded as mental ugliness.Gorkom (2010), Definition of macchariya ===Mahayana=== The Abhidharma-samuccaya states: :What is matsarya? It is an over-concern with the material things in life stemming from over-attachment to wealth and honor, and it belongs to passion-lust. Avarice functions as the basis for not letting up in one's concern for the material things of life. Alexander Berzin explains: :Miserliness (ser-sna) is a part of longing desire (Sanskrit: raga) and is an attachment to material gain or respect and, not wanting to give up any possessions, clings to them and does not want to share them with others or use them ourselves. Thus, miserliness is more than the English word stinginess. Stinginess is merely unwillingness to share or to use something we possess. It lacks the aspect of hoarding that miserliness possesses.Berzin (2006) == See also == * Mental factors (Buddhism) == References  Sources == * Berzin, Alexander (2006), Primary Minds and the 51 Mental Factors * Goleman, Daniel (2008).

He also used the pseudonym Jan Sulima. ==Life== Born in Poland to a musical family, he began his formal training as a pianist at the Warszawa Conservatory under Moszkowski. He also lived in Berlin briefly (using the name Joseph Schultz) and later moved to Paris to complete his studies in conducting and composition in 1899, converting the spelling of his first name to Joseph. At the conservatoire he trained under Jules Massenet. In 1903 he moved to Brussels, where he was made chief conductor at the Théâtre de la Monnaie and saw instant success with his ballet Ispahan and several tunes. His wife, Suzy Delsart, was an operetta star (operette divette) and sang the title role of The Merry Widow by Franz Lehár and also influenced her husband into writing lighter and more popular tunes. In 1907 he completed the music for Marcel Gerbidon's operetta,Flossie or Je m'appelle Flossie. In 1908 he adapted Pierre Veber's comedy Loute, then in 1914 began the musical comedy Flup ! to a libretto by Gaston Dumestre, which had a successful premiere in 1920, followed by 5,000 performances. His other successes included Titin to a libretto by Gaston Dumestre. Between World War I and World War II, he composed nearly twenty operettas. Additionally, he wrote songs to poetry of Paul Verlaine (Opus 83) one song of which was recorded by the great tenor, Enrico Caruso. It was recorded by other major artists of the day and was featured in an anthology printed in the United States by International Music Company. Sergius Kage was the compiler of this anthology. Szulc wrote some other lieder to German poetry which were published in Berlin during a brief stint there. he also composed a Violin Sonata. Szulc's song, \\"Clair de Lune\\", from his 10 Melodies, Op. 83, has been recorded by French countertenor Philippe Jaroussky on his album Green – Melodies Francaises. This was also the song recorded by Caruso and other artists in the 1910s and 20s. Collections of Szulc operetta scores have been found in the University of Nebraska, Lincoln music library, donated by Jack Rokhar. Another collection can be found at the British Library. The donor pasted many articles and reviews in the flyleaf of these scores and they are an invaluable source of information for researchers. == Musical comedies == *1920 : \\"Flup !\\", with a libretto by Gaston Dumestre *1920 : \\"Titin\\", with a libretto by Gaston Dumestre *1925 : \\"Mannequins\\", with a libretto by Jacques Bousquet and *1926 : \\"Divin Mensonge\\", with a libretto by Alex Madis, Pierre Veber and Hugues Delorme. *1945 : \\"Pantoufle\\", with a libretto by Albert Willemetz == Filmography == *1930 : La route est belle, directed by Robert Florey and André Baugé *1930 : L'Enfant de l'amour, directed by Marcel L'Herbier *1933 : Mannequins, directed by René Hervil *1933 : , directed by Karl Anton *1935 : Une nuit de noces, directed by Maurice Kéroul and Georges Monca == Discography == *2013 : Violin sonata in A minor op. 61 – Acte Préalable AP0271 ==Notes== 1\\\\. ^Brister, Wanda.

It was written by Carlos Trillo, and drawn by Ernesto García Seijas. The words \\"Negro\\" and \\"Blanco\\" mean black and white in Spanish, but Blanco is simply the family name of the main character and \\"Negro\\" is a common Argentinian nickname. ==Premise== Same as with the former comic strip El Loco Chávez that this one replaced, the main character is a fictional journalist, who works in a fictional depiction of the Clarín newspaper that published it. Most story arcs were about both some weird news report assigned to him, or trivial ones that develop an unexpected twist, and a romantic affair. The Negro Blanco develops relations with many different women, but Chispa Valdéz and Flopi Bach are recurring ones. ==Publication== Cover for an Argentinian Playboy magazine featuring Flopi Bach (left) and Araceli González (right). El Negro Blanco was published by the Clarín newspaper from 1987 to 1994. It replaced El Loco Chávez at the page devoted to comic strips, being replaced at its end by El Nene Montanaro. The newspaper added extra stories at the Sunday magazine on some occasions. Ivrea republished the whole run of the comic strip in 10 comic books in prestige format in 2006, and El Globo Editor published a specific story arc in 1993. The character Carlos Marcucci is freely based on a real man with that name, friend of the writer Carlos Trillo. According to Marcucci, Ernesto García Seijas accurately portrayed him as an ugly man, who is nevertheless successful with women (however, the comic strip took that to parodic levels). To design the character of Flopi Bach, Seijas modeled her after Araceli González, then an unknown model hired for that work.Aquellas mujeres inolvidables The character was very successful, and both González and the character appeared at a 1991 issue of the Argentine edition of the Playboy magazine.El Negro Blanco It was the first time that Playboy published erotic images of a fictional character instead of photos of real people.Carlos Trillo y Ernesto García Seijas Seijas took the character for spin-off series, after the end of the comic strip. Trillo and Seijas worked as well in the \\"Sangre de brujas\\" () comic book, another spin-off with the character Agatha. ==Characters== * Roberto \\"Negro\\" Blanco: It's the main character of the comic strip. He is a journalist of the Clarín newspaper, a metafictional reference to the real newspaper that published the comic strip. * Chispa Valdéz: She's the main girlfriend of the Negro. They met again after several years without contact in the beginning of the comic strip. She is an architect, and finally gets married with someone else. * Flopi Bach: She is the second girlfriend of the Negro, introduced some time afterwards. Negro would move from one to the other, in the different story arcs. She began as a novice reporter for the newspaper, but was hired later by a sensationalist news program. Negro left her, and she swore vengeance against him. * Carlos Marcucci: A friend of the Negro Blanco, troubled because all women try to seduce him. * Aníbal: The Negro's boss at Clarín newspaper. * Susana: Susana is a fellow reporter of the newspaper. She likes the Negro Blanco, but he never got interested in her. * Agatha: Agatha is a witch that influences the other's lives. She appeared in the first story arcs. * Miguel: Miguel is yet another friend of Negro. * Melisa Caramelo: A psychiatrist, romantically interested in Aníbal. * Roberto Blanco sr.: The Negro's father. * Badaracco: Flopi's boss at the news program. * Cococha Valdivia: Cococha Valdivia is a character from the TV channel, interested in gossip, both of close and famous people. The graphic design is similar to that of Olive Oyl, and the name is also similar (Olive Oyl has been translated to Spanish audiences as \\"Olivia\\"). * The TV channel director: The TV channel is directed by a megalomaniac man, without a defined name across the stories. Other characters usually talk about him using grandiloquent names such as \\"the King of Kings\\", \\"Raging Zeus\\", \\"The Great Manitu\\", etc. ==References== Category:1987 establishments in Argentina Category:1994 disestablishments in Argentina Category:1987 comics debuts Category:1994 comics endings Category:Argentine comic strips Category:Humor comics Category:Erotic comics Category:Fictional reporters Category:Fictional Argentine people ","title":"El Negro Blanco"},{"id":"35884934","text":"Jorge Antonio Urreta Merino (born 8 June 1950 in Mexico City) is a Mexican former swimmer who competed in the 1968 Summer Olympics and in the 1972 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Mexican male swimmers Category:Sportspeople from Mexico City Category:Male freestyle swimmers Category:Olympic swimmers of Mexico Category:Swimmers at the 1968 Summer Olympics Category:Swimmers at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Pan American Games competitors for Mexico Category:Swimmers at the 1971 Pan American Games Category:Central American and Caribbean Games gold medalists for Mexico Category:Competitors at the 1970 Central American and Caribbean Games Category:Central American and Caribbean Games medalists in swimming ","title":"Jorge Urreta"},{"id":"35884935","text":"Joe and Max is a 2002 American-German boxing film directed by Steve James and based on the true story of the two boxing matches between American Joe Louis and German Max Schmeling. ==Plot== In 1936, African American boxer Joe Louis (Leonard Roberts), trained by Jack Blackburn (Richard Roundtree), is undefeated and apparently invincible. Then Jewish-American boxing manager Joe Jacobs (David Paymer) obtains a film of his fight against Paulino Uzcudun in Madison Square Garden. Jacobs delivers the film to his client, German heavyweight champion Max Schmeling (Til Schweiger). A pioneer of video analysis, Schmeling discovers how Louis always neglects his guard when he has just delivered a certain blow. Schmeling decides to seek a fight with Louis. The next year they fight in the United States. The German, who is nine years Louis's senior, surprises everybody by winning. The German boxer returns home. The reigning Nazi government strive to exploit his coup for their propaganda, but he refuses to sign a treatise supporting the Nazi line because for him it is unthinkable to comply with the racial policy of Nazi Germany. Only his currently huge popularity saves him from their wrath. Moreover, Schmeling is allowed to keep his manager despite all the discrimination Jews are facing in Germany at this time. Nevertheless, Hitler (Rolf Kanies) himself forces Schmeling to sign the Nazi treatise at last. Schmeling feels that he owes Louis a rematch. This time the American audience is completely against Schmeling because the Nazis have succeeded in using him in their propaganda. Right at the beginning of this fight Schmeling is hit in the lumbar region and suffers a spinal injury. Unable to keep on fighting he must forfeit. Joe Louis visits him after the fight when Schmeling is being treated in a hospital. Joe Jacobs remains in USA when Schmeling returns home again. Schmeling's wife, Anny Ondra (Peta Wilson), waits for him at the airport; but this time there is nobody else to receive him. Joe's fate is exactly the opposite. He is revered by the public, but his wife Marva (Siena Goines) leaves him because she can't deal with the effect this has on him. Meanwhile in Germany, the Kristallnacht takes place. Max Schmeling and Anny Ondra hide his Jewish tailor in their house. In the end only Anny Ondra's aptitude as an actress saves their lives. Even so, Max Schmeling never agrees to become a member of the ruling Nazi party. Eventually he has to serve as a soldier in the Fallschirmjäger while Joe Louis does exhibition fights for the United States Army. After the war both boxers face personal difficulties. Schmeling's house in Germany is destroyed. Joe Louis has problems with the Internal Revenue Service. Both are clearly past their prime, but still they have to return to the boxing ring. Max Schmeling is eventually lucky because an American boxing official remembers him when Coca-Cola is looking for an appropriate representative in Germany. With Anny Ondra's approval, he accepts the offered position. When Schmeling travels to America on a business trip, he visits the divorced and impoverished Joe Louis. They remain friends for the rest of their lives. ==Reception== Critics judged the DVD was worthwhile watching for boxing fans although the film had palpably been made for TV. Also, the film's message was praised. ==See also== *Max Schmeling (film) ==ReferencesCategory:2002 films Category:2000s sports drama films Category:2002 biographical drama films Category:2002 television films Category:American boxing films Category:American films Category:German films Category:American television films Category:German television films Category:English-language films Category:English-language television shows Category:American biographical drama films Category:German biographical films Category:American biographical films Category:American drama films Category:German drama films Category:Sports films based on actual events Category:Films set in the 1930s Category:Films set in the 1940s Category:Biographical films about sportspeople Category:Films directed by Steve James Category:Cultural depictions of Joe Louis Category:Cultural depictions of Max Schmeling Category:2002 drama films ","title":"Joe and Max"},{"id":"35884945","text":"José Luis Prado Medel (born 12 November 1956) is a Mexican former swimmer who competed in the 1972 Summer Olympics and in the 1976 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Mexican male swimmers Category:Male freestyle swimmers Category:Male butterfly swimmers Category:Male medley swimmers Category:Olympic swimmers of Mexico Category:Swimmers at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Swimmers at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Pan American Games competitors for Mexico Category:Swimmers at the 1971 Pan American Games Category:Central American and Caribbean Games gold medalists for Mexico Category:Competitors at the 1974 Central American and Caribbean Games Category:Central American and Caribbean Games medalists in swimming ","title":"José Luis Prado"},{"id":"35884949","text":"The Rice Owls women's basketball team represents Rice University in women's basketball.

The team competes in the American Athletic Conference. They play home games on campus in Devlin Fieldhouse, the 9th- oldest active basketball venue in the nation. The team's last appearance in the NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament was in 2015. ==History== Tulane's women's basketball program has found continuous success under Lisa Stockton, who began coaching at Tulane in 1995. That year, Stockton led the team to its first NCAA Tournament appearance and was named Metro Conference Coach of the Year. That first appearance began a string of 9 consecutive NCAA Tournament berths. The team earned regular-season C-USA championships 4 times, the last in the 2009-10 season, when they finished with a 23-6 record (14-2 in C-USA). In addition, the program won the C-USA tournament 5 times: 1996-97, 1998-99, 1999-2000, 2000-01, and 2009-10\\\\. Lisa Stockton was twice named C-USA Coach of the Year (2006-07 and 2009-10). 2006-07 seniors Jami Montagnino (ranked 5th in NCAA Division I teams in free-throw percentage) and D'Aundra Henry proved essential to the team's success, both hitting 1,000 points for their careers in that season. That team was upset by Rice 64-52 in the C-USA semifinals in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and did not receive an at-large bid to the 2007 NCAA Tournament. With a final record of 25-6, they became the first team with 25 or more wins and six or fewer losses not to make it into the 64-team bracket, along with a 26-3 Montana team. Following a 62-53 win over UAB in the 2010 C-USA Tournament Final, the team advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2003. During the 2011-12 season, senior Brett Benzio became the second female and third Tulane basketball player ever to reach 1,000 points and 1,000 rebounds in a season. ==Team achievementsYearly records=Postseason tournament appearances=== Under Lisa Stockton, the Green Wave have appeared in 18 postseason tournaments.

He also owns and operates Modus Collection Clothing, a chess-inspired line of men's and women's apparel. ==Background== Deoleo was born in the Dominican Republic. His parents moved the family to Passaic, New Jersey when he was two and then Salem, Massachusetts when he was five. After graduating from Salem High School in 1998 he earned a Communications degree from Endicott College in Beverly, Massachusetts. Deoleo has run and completed The New York City Marathon and the Chicago Marathon, as well as competed in numerous triathlons. He is active in Crossfit, a \\"high-intensity strength and conditioning\\" fitness program. ==Career== In 2000, during his sophomore year at Endicott, he began an internship at Jam'n 94.5 for The Baltazar & Pebbles Morning Show doing audio production.

I bully him and people say, 'Wow he's bullying him!' but then they ultimately rally for Kulo.\\" Deoleo worked his way up to co-producer and in 2007 was promoted to Executive Producer of the morning show. \\"You have to be able to do anything, and don't be afraid to ask questions,\\" Deoleo says. \\"People love to talk about themselves so if you ask them how they would fix a problem, they are always willing to help you out and explain it.\\" In December 2012, morning show co-hosts Pebbles (radio personality) and Melissa were let go by Clear Channel Communications. The show was renamed \\"Ramiro and The JAM'N 94.5 Morning Show,\\" which saw Deoleo take on a more prominent on-air role as himself, rather than Krazy Kulo. In January 2013, Real World star Ashlee Feldman was named co-host of the revamped morning show. In April 2012, Deoleo was named one of Stuff Boston's sexiest Bostonians, \\"a lineup of lovely, lust-worthy locals who represent a broad range of sexy styles\\". On July 22, 2015, it was released that both Ramiro and Santi were released from the station, and that Ashlee Feldman and Frankie Vinci would host the show beginning the following Monday (July 27) After several months off the air, mainly heading into 2016, in April, Santi was hired at Greater Media. He currently works as the Executive Producer for 102.5 WKLB (Country 102.5). ==Modus Collection== In September 2010, Deoleo launched Modus Collection Clothing. Having had a fervor for fashion since a young boy, one of Deoleo's dreams was to start his own clothing company. \\"Putting clothes together was one of my early loves in life. Some people can look at an old beat-up car or a couple of pieces of wood and see how, with some work, it could turn into a beautiful machine or a great piece of furniture. I see that with clothes, it's how I express myself.\\" Each design, which Deoleo creates himself, is chess inspired, which comes from his lifelong passion for playing chess. The company's tagline is \\"What's Your Next Move\\". In September 2011 he launched Modus Girl which he says \\"is more along the lines of the kind of shirts that can be worn out to the bar, as opposed to beach day apparel.\\" Modus Collection is available online and in boutiques throughout the Boston area. ==Good Rep Culture== In January 2013, Deoleo launched Good Rep Culture, a clothing line inspired by his love for Crossfit that \\"fuses fashion with elite fitness.\\"http://goodrepculture.com ==References * http://www.moduscollectionclothing.com/ * http://www.jamn945.com/pages/krazy_kulo.html * https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=671522013 * https://twitter.com/santideoleo * https://www.goodrepculture.com/ Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Radio personalities from Boston Category:Dominican Republic emigrants to the United States ","title":"Santi Deoleo"},{"id":"35885010","text":"Herbert William Hodgson (23 May 1891 - 30 April 1964) was an English cricketer.

Leading to deep spiritual personal revelations, he felt drawn to writing a story about it. On June 30, King e-mailed numerous musicians he desired to write alongside with conceptual ideas, rough demos and the deadline of November 11, 2011 (following from the concept). Though this deadline was quickly approaching, the \\"wealth of musicians\\" King described as responding to his offer over the next two weeks pooled together to create almost two albums' worth of material; the next stage was the lyrics, which King had researched extensively before officially declaring the project, and recording proceeded smoothly within King's and Hansen's studios and the residences of the participants. One of the album's central concepts, reflected in its title, is the Kairos Moment, About the Kairos Moment \\"a moment in 'infinity,' a moment in God's time, a moment that creates destiny\\" as King states,http://heavymetal.about.com/od/interviews/a/Lance-King-Interview.htm About.com interview although there are multiple sub-themes, ranging from patterns and their meanings, particularly numerical ones including double and triple 3's, 8's and 11's, to political deception, spirituality, numberology and Christian philosophy. King characterizes the overall message as \\"extremely deep\\" and one which is delivered through both lyrics and the music designed around them.http://rocknoteswebzine.com/interviews/lance-king-interview/ Rocknotes Webzine interview A slice of profits from the album's sales are donated to combating human trafficking through the nonprofit Not for Sale Campaign. == Reception == A Moment in Chiros was overall warmly received by critics. Long-time fans of King have declared the album's summation of his stylistic range creates an ideal gateway into his career, with Hardrock Haven branding it \\"the most intricate and interesting album Lance King has ever participated in, and one that should please fans of his previous efforts.\\" http://hardrockhaven.net/online/2011/11/lance-king-a-moment-in-chiros/ Hardrock Haven review Reviewers also noticed similarities with the bands of both primary and secondary composers, specifically Anubis Gate, whose guitarist/keyboardist Kim Olesen possesses the most instrumental credits on the album, and the songwriting contributions of Myrath members Malek Ben Arbia and Elyes Bouchoucha were likened to those of their home band.http://www.metalunderground.com/reviews/details.cfm?releaseid=5833 Metalunderground review ==Track listingPersonnel Primary musicians === * Lance King – all vocals, all vocal melodies except choruses of \\"Awakening\\" and \\"A Moment in Chiros\\" * Kim Olesen – guitars (tracks 3, 5-11), lead guitar (track 1), bass (tracks 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11), keyboards, chorus melody on \\"A Moment in Chiros\\" * Morten Gade Sørensen – drums === Secondary musicians === * Michael Harris - lead and rhythm guitars, keyboards, bass (track 10) * Markus Sigfridsson - lead and rhythm guitars, keyboards (tracks 2, 8), chorus melody on \\"Awakening\\" * Malek Ben Arbia - lead and rhythm guitars (track 9) * Vince Benaim - rhythm guitar (track 1) * Shane Dhiman - guitars (track 3) * Jacob Hansen - guitars (tracks 4, 6), bass (track 4) * Tore St Moren - guitars (track 11) * Fred Colombo - keyboards (tracks 1, 11), outro of \\"Transformation\\" * Elyes Bouchoucha - keyboards (track 9) * Giuseppe \\"Mistheria\\" Iampieri - piano (track 7) * Michael Hansen - bass (track 3) * Anis Jouini - bass (track 9) * Tomy King - violin (tracks 2, 8) === Production === * Jacob Hansen - producer, mixing and mastering * Kevin Codfert - additional tracking on \\"Joy Everlasting\\" * Kim Olesen - Pre-production, arrangements, mixing * Markus Sigfridsson - cover art, layout * Lee King, Esa Ahola - photography ==References== * Not For Sale Campaign Category:2011 albums Category:Nightmare Records albums Category:Albums produced by Jacob Hansen ","title":"A Moment in Chiros"},{"id":"35885067","text":"Mordellistena metcalfi is a species of beetle in the genus Mordellistena of the family Mordellidae.

This kind of construction is found in archaeological sites in northwestern Europe from the Bronze Age. It was also used in more modern times by Mennonites in Flanders and the Netherlands.Harry Leonard Sawatzky, \\"They Sought a Country: Mennonite Colonization in Mexico. With an Appendix on Mennonite Colonization in British Honduras\\", 1971, , p. 272 == Distribution  Germany === Schematic diagram of an ice age byre-dwelling based on excavations on the Modern era byre-dwelling in Bavaria (Eckersdorf, Upper Franconia) The generic German term is Wohnstallhaus from wohnung (\\"dwelling\\"), stall (\\"byre\\", \\"sty)\\" and haus (\\"house\\"). From the Iron Age onwards the longhouse, developed from the byre-dwellings of the Bronze Age with its domestic area and adjacent cattle bays, was found across the North German Plain. As a result of the keeping of ever larger herds of cattle, these buildings became longer. Examples of such Iron Age longhouses were first excavated in large numbers on the warft of near the German North Sea coastal town of Cuxhaven. Since then, this type of house has been found from Holland to South Jutland (for its construction see the post in ground article). The variation of the hall house known as the Low Saxon house (Niedersachsenhaus) was developed from the longhouse. This type of dwelling is distributed across the North German Plain from the Netherlands to the Bay of Gdansk (Danzig) and bounded in the south by the Central Uplands. To the south of this region is found the Middle German house (Ernhaus) which also occurs as a byre-dwelling and was found in many sub-variants from the Rhine to the far side of the River Vistula. Early on this type was developed into variants that separated the various functions. For example, the functions of cattle shed and barn were later transferred to separate buildings or had never been part of the domestic building at all. Two-storey byre-dwellings with stone walled ground floors occurred in the northeast of Baden-Württemberg in the 15th century. They were described as Pastor Mayer houses (Pfarrer-Mayer-Häuser).Albrecht Bedal (ed.): Alte Gebäude, neue Erkenntnisse. Zwei Freilichtmuseen und ihr Häusererbe im 21. Jahrhundert. Schwäbisch Hall, 2012. The Black Forest house is probably a more recent development of a byre-dwelling, whereby the functions (especially on hillsides) were also divided over two floors. Likewise the Haubarg in North Frisia is a recent development of the Early Modern Period from the East Frisian Gulfhaus. === Switzerland === Engadine house in Ardez The Engadine house which emerged in the 15th/16th centuries, especially in the Engadine, is a typical byre-dwelling. It is a solid, stone building, usually with a wooden core, which comprises domestic and working areas, one behind the other, under a single, broad saddle roof. The domestic and working areas cover three storeys, with a gate on the lower and ground floors. On the lower floor is the byre (Stallhof or ') with access to the cattle bays and cellars. At the front of the ground floor storey is the vestibule (Sulèr, pietan) leading to the living quarters: the parlour (Stube), kitchen (Küche), larder (Vorratskammer) and, at the back, the barn (Scheune) for the hay. A haycart (Heukarren, tragliun) could only be taken through the upper gate or the vestibule into the barn. On the upper storey (Palatschin) are the bedrooms. The sitting room has the only stove, which heated the living quarters from the kitchen outwards. While the division of the rooms and the position of the windows and oriels (with their view of the well) were based mainly on practical considerations, the facades of Engadine houses were often richly decorated with murals and sgraffiti. For centuries, Engadine houses dominated the scene in the Engadine villages of Ardez, Guarda, Zuoz, La Punt etc., where they were grouped around a common well as a village quarter that formed a Romanesque cooperative farming organisation. === British Isles === The plan of a typical Dartmoor longhouse In England too, there was a very similar type of dwelling, of which remains survive in the southwest, for example in the longhouse variants of Dartmoor, in Cornwall or in Wales. In Ireland there are similar byre- dwellings, albeit the fireplace here appears to have been placed against a gable wall.Traditional rural buildings in Ireland with floor plans In northwestern England this type of dwelling is also described in the Cumbrian countryside. === Arabia === Compared are the Yemeni towerhouses, in which the ground floor was reserved for animals, with dwellings on higher floors.\\"Architecture, Modernity, and Preservation: The Tower House of Sana'a, Yemen\\" ==See also== *Grubenhaus *Low German house *Middle German house ==References== Category:House styles Category:European archaeology Category:House types Category:Barns ","title":"Byre-dwelling"},{"id":"35885120","text":"Curbridge and Lew are civil parishes in West Oxfordshire, located to the south-west of Witney, Oxfordshire, that share a common parish council.

His personal name was Lü Yuan (呂元), ancestral name Jiang (姜), and Duke Hui was his posthumous title. He was known as Prince Yuan before ascending the throne. ==Accession to the throne== Duke Hui's father was Duke Huan of Qi, who was the first of the Five Hegemons, the most powerful rulers of the Spring and Autumn period. Duke Huan had at least three main wives who bore no sons, six favoured concubines, and more than ten sons. Duke Hui was then known as Prince Yuan, and his mother was the younger Wey Ji, one of two princesses of the State of Wey who were among Duke Huan's favoured concubines. Five other sons of Duke Huan also contended for the throne: Prince Wukui, Crown Prince Zhao (later Duke Xiao), Prince Pan (later Duke Zhao), Prince Shangren (later Duke Yì), and Prince Yong. When Duke Huan died in the tenth month of 643 BC, the six princes fought one another for the throne. Wukui, the son of the elder Wey Ji, prevailed at first, but was killed three months later and replaced by Duke Xiao. Duke Xiao died after ten years of reign, and was succeeded by Duke Zhao whose supporters killed Duke Xiao's son. When Duke Zhao died in 613 BC, his son She ascended the throne, but was soon murdered by his uncle Duke Yì. Duke Yì reigned for four years before being killed by Bing Chu (邴歜) and Yan Zhi (閻職) in 609 BC. The ministers of Qi deposed Duke Yì's son and installed his brother Prince Yuan, who was then exiled in the State of Wey, on the throne. Prince Yuan, posthumously known as Duke Hui of Qi, was the last of the five sons of Duke Huan to ascend the Qi throne. ==Reign and succession== In 607 BC, the second year of Duke Hui's reign, the Long Di tribes invaded Qi. Qi general Wangzi Chengfu (王子城父) defeated the invaders and killed their leader Rongru (榮如). Duke Hui reigned for ten years and died in 599 BC. He was succeeded by his son Wuye, Duke Qing of Qi. Duke Hui favoured the official Cui Zhu (崔杼). After Duke Hui's death the powerful Gao and Guo clans of Qi expelled Cui, who fled to the State of Wey. Cui would later return to Qi and cause great turmoil in the state. ==Family== * Parents: ** Prince Xiaobai (; d. 643 BC), ruled as Duke Huan of Qi from 684–643 BC ** Shao Wey Ji, of the Ji clan of Wey () * Wives: ** Xiao Tong Shu Zi, of the Zi clan (), the mother of Prince Wuye * Sons: ** Prince Wuye (; d. 582 BC), ruled as Duke Qing of Qi from 598–582 BC ==References== Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Monarchs of Qi (state) Category:7th-century BC Chinese monarchs Category:6th-century BC Chinese monarchs Category:599 BC deaths ","title":"Duke Hui of Qi"},{"id":"35885190","text":"Mateo De Angulo Velasco (born June 18, 1990 in Cali) is a Colombian swimmer, who specialized in long-distance freestyle events.

De Angulo helped his Colombian team to take the trophy in the 800 m freestyle relay at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico. De Angulo qualified for the men's 400 m freestyle at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, by establishing a Colombian record and a time faster than the FINA B-cut off time of 3:53.66 from the Indy Grand Prix in Indianapolis, Indiana. He challenged former world champion and USC Trojans swimmer Mateusz Sawrymowicz of Poland, Florida Southern Moccasins swimmer Allan Gutierrez Castro of Honduras, and Palestine's Ahmed Gebrel on the first heat. De Angulo cruised to second place by four seconds behind Sawrymowicz in 3:57.76. De Angulo failed to advance into the final, as he placed twenty-sixth overall on the first day of preliminaries.

Situated on the eastern slope of Chestnut Ridge, one of the westernmost ridges in the Appalachian Mountain Range, Quebec Run is heavily forested and contains several miles of maintained, interconnected trail. As is the case with all Pennsylvania state forest wild areas, no development of a permanent nature is permitted “in order to retain the undeveloped character of the area.” Quebec Run is the largest wild area without a road in southwestern Pennsylvania and serves as a destination for various outdoor activities including hiking, mountain biking, and cross-country skiing. Quebec Run Wild Area is one of two wild areas most recently added to the Pennsylvania state forest system in 2004 (the other is Hammersley Wild Area in Susquehannock State Forest). ==History== While surveying the Mason–Dixon line in 1767, the English astronomer George Mason and a team of colonial surveyors ascended Chestnut Ridge and passed within three miles of the southern tip of Quebec Run. Mason described the area in his journal as \\"a wild of wildes: the laurel overgrown, the rocks gaping to swallow up, over whose deep mouths you may step. The whole is a deep melancholy appearance out of nature.” At this time Quebec Run was blanketed by old-growth forest dominated by American chestnut, eastern hemlock, oak, and maple. Quebec Run Wild Area has since seen extensive logging activity. The area was most recently harvested between 1938 and 1940 by the Summit Lumber Co. of Uniontown. Evidence of this activity lingers to the present day, as seen by the remnants of old logging roads and the presence of brown sawdust piles. The vestiges of a building foundation situated along Mill Run marks the site of a saw mill which was built in the late 1930s or early 1940s. A local legend exists about a group of Confederate soldiers who buried a large cache of gold, allegedly stolen from nearby Union banks during the Civil War, just north of the stream known as Quebec Run. While no evidence has been found to support this story, several excavation sites believed to be attempts to recover the gold still exist and are accessible from Hess Trail. Quebec Run Wild Area has been managed as a wild area since 1972 but was not officially designated a Pennsylvania state forest wild area until 2004. ==Ecology== thumb One of many water falls found along Quebec Run alt=Waterfalls along the Quebec Run stream Today Quebec Run Wild Area is a healthy third-growth forest in the Appalachian mixed mesophytic ecoregion. The woods are composed of chestnut oak, red oak, red maple, black cherry, eastern hemlock, and pine. Mountain laurel and northern maidenhair fern are common along the higher slopes and ridges, while wood nettle and rhododendron thickets line the banks of many streams. Wildlife includes white-tailed deer, beaver, skunk, wild turkey, red fox, coyote, timber rattlesnake, bobcat, and American black bear. Several fast moving, rocky streams flow through the area, including Hess Run, Tebolt Run, and Quebec Run. These streams intersect many of the area's trails, and all are tributaries of Big Sandy Creek. The limestone solutional cave known locally as Barton’s Cave lies within the upper reaches of the Quebec Run watershed. The cave is used by bats for hibernation and is frequently visited by cavers. ==Recreation== The Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources states that \\"a wild area is an extensive area, which the general public will be permitted to see, use and enjoy for such activities as hiking, hunting, and fishing.\\" Hiking is therefore permitted on all trails in Quebec Run Wild Area, while cross-country skiing, mountain biking, and horseback riding are permitted on designated trails. A permit is required for camping only when staying in the same location for more than one night. As a state-designated wild area, bathrooms and rest areas are not available at Quebec Run. Patrons are advised to carry an adequate supply of drinking water. ===Trails=== The Quebec Run trail system consists of at least 11 interconnected trails with a combined length of more than 26 miles. The trails are maintained by Forbes State Forest and by volunteers. The trails are short, blazed in blue, and can be combined with what remains of the old logging roads (which are not blazed), allowing for custom loops to fit a variety of experience levels. The longest trails are Hess Trail and Tebolt Trail at 4.1 mi (6.60 km) and 3.9 mi (6.27 km), respectively. ==See also== *List of Pennsylvania state forest wild areas *List of Pennsylvania state forests ==References== Category:Protected areas of Fayette County, Pennsylvania ","title":"Quebec Run Wild Area"},{"id":"35885237","text":"Peter Leško (born 23 September 1991) is a former Slovak football defender. ==1.

From 1950 to 1951 he got a Rockefeller fellowship and worked at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. From 1970 until his retirement in 1979 he was professor at the University of California, Irvine. Hooijer published 267 scientific articles about vertebrate fossils from Indonesia, Africa, the Near East (especially Israel), the Netherlands, the Antilles, and South America. Many of these work were devoted to fossil rhinoceroses, cats, hogs, rodents, primates, and probiscoidae. He described six new genera, including Celebochoerus, Chilotheridium, Epileptobos, Paradiceros, Paulocnus, and Spelaeomys and 47 new species and subspecies, including Babyrousa bolabatuensis, Elephas celebensis and the Flores Cave Rat. Hooijer was married and had two daughters and one son. He died in Leiden, Netherlands. == References == * L. B. Holthuis: 1820 - 1958 Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie C.h.j.m.

Tempranillo blanco is a white Spanish wine grape variety that is grown in the Rioja Denominación de Origen (DOC). It is a mutation of the red Tempranillo grape variety that is planted in Rioja. The white grape variety was discovered in a Tempranillo vineyard in the Rioja region by a wine grower in the late 20th century. In 2007, the Consejo Regulador of Rioja officially sanctioned the use of Tempranillo blanco in the DOC wines of Rioja.Victor de la Serna \\"Rioja goes varietal happy \\" Wine Business International Jan 20th, 2007 ==History== Tempranillo blanco was discovered in 1988 by a wine grower in a Tempranillo vineyard near Murillo de Río Leza in the La Rioja province of northern Spain. While Tempranillo is a dark-skin variety used to produce red wine, the grower discovered that one of his vines had undergone a mutation that produced yellow-green clusters after veraison.Rioja DOC \\"Grape Varieties\\" Official Site. Accessed: May 20th, 2012 In the 21st century, the University of La Rioja and the Agricultural Research and Development Centre (CIDA) worked with local wineries (such as Viña Ijalba) to help revive and establish native grape varieties such as Tempranillo.Wines From Spain (trade organization) \\"Viña Ijalba reinterprets wines from Rioja\\" pg 3, December 30th, 2011 ==Use in Rioja== Tempranillo (pictured) is widely grown in Rioja and usually produces darkly colored grapes that are used to make red wine. Tempranillo blanco is a white mutation of this variety. Currently Tempranillo blanco is found only in the Rioja wine region of Spain. In 2007, the Spanish Institute for Foreign Trade working with the Consejo Regulador of the Rioja region came to an agreement that would allow the planting and use of Tempranillo blanco in white Rioja wines produced under the DOC labels. Tempranillo blanco was one of three native white varieties added to permitted list of Rioja grapes--Maturana Blanca and Turruntés being the others. Additionally, Maturana Tinta, Maturano, Monastel, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo were added with Tempranillo blanco in the first major change of the Rioja wine laws involving grape varieties since the wine region was officially established in 1925.Jacob Gaffney \\"Rioja to Allow New Grape Varieties\\" The Wine Spectator January 29, 2007 Under the DOC rules, in order to have new plantings of Tempranillo blanco vineyards must pull up or uproot a previous planting of another variety. Wineries are able to use Tempranillo blanco in blends or as a varietal bottling. ==Viticulture and winemaking== An experimental vineyard with Tempranillo blanco plantings in the Rioja. Tempranillo blanco produces medium- sized clusters with loose, average size berries that are yellow-green in color. The variety buds late but goes through veraison and ripens early. At harvest the grapes usually have a high malic acid and high levels of aromatic phenolic compounds such as terpenes that contribute floral, tropical and citrus notes to the wine. As a new variety, growers and winemakers are still learning about Tempranillo blanco and the types of wines it can produce.

The club improved on its league performance in the previous season by finishing 7th in the 2012–13 Scottish Premier League, but were eliminated from the 2012–13 Scottish League Cup in the second round by Queen of the South. Hibernian progressed in the 2012–13 Scottish Cup to the 2013 Scottish Cup Final, but this was lost 3–0 to league champions Celtic. ==Friendlies== Hibs announced their pre-season friendly programme on 20 June 2012. A fixture against Union Berlin was originally scheduled to be played at Easter Road, but was switched to Berlin. A match against Rapid Bucharest, scheduled for 11 July, was called off due to a waterlogged pitch. A fixture at East Fife was arranged instead. ===Fixtures=== ;Legend ==Scottish Premier League== The league season began on 5 August 2012, with a 3–0 defeat against Dundee United at Tannadice. The first home game was an Edinburgh derby, which saw an improved performance by Hibs as the game ended in a 1–1 draw. Hibs earned their first win in the next game, away to St Mirren. A run of results without defeat followed, suggesting that Pat Fenlon had succeeded in rebuilding the team. Further positive results meant that Hibs reached the top of the league in November. This was followed by a run of four defeats in five matches, including a 3–2 loss to Motherwell despite having led 2–0. A win and a draw against Celtic and Hearts meant that Hibs went into the winter break with 32 points from 22 games, just one less point than they accrued in the whole of the 2011–12 season. A poor run of results after the winter break, however, meant that Hibs slipped into the bottom half of the league at the split. The match against Kilmarnock on 5 May was abandoned after 54 minutes played because a spectator had fallen gravely ill and required emergency medical assistance. A run of victories towards the end of the season meant that Hibs finished in seventh place. ===Fixtures=== ;Legend ==Scottish Cup== Hibs entered the 2012–13 Scottish Cup in the fourth round, with a home tie against Edinburgh derby rivals Hearts. Hibs captain James McPake welcomed the draw, an immediate repeat of the 2012 Scottish Cup Final. A late deflected goal gave Hibs a 1–0 victory, ending a 12 match unbeaten run for Hearts in the derby. Hibs were then drawn at home against Scottish Premier League opposition for a second time, being paired with the winner of a replayed tie between Aberdeen and Motherwell. A long-range strike by Gary Deegan and a penalty save by Ben Williams were key contributions as Hibs defeated Aberdeen 1–0. The quarter-final draw gave Hibs an away tie against Kilmarnock. Leigh Griffiths scored a hat-trick as Hibs progressed to the semi-finals with a 4–2 victory at Rugby Park. Hibs were drawn against First Division club Falkirk in the semi- finals. Hibs went into the semi-final on a poor run of form, which had cost them a place in the top half of the SPL. Falkirk took a 3–0 lead before half- time, but Hibs produced \\"one of the great Scottish Cup fightbacks\\" to win 4–3 after extra time. Celtic also won 4–3 in their semi-final, against Dundee United, to set up the 2013 Scottish Cup Final match. Despite Hibs having a bright start to the match, poor defending allowed Gary Hooper to score two first half goals for Celtic. Hibs rarely threatened another comeback and Joe Ledley scored late on to clinch a 3–0 win for Celtic. ===Fixtures=== ;Legend ==Scottish League Cup== As a Scottish Premier League club that had not qualified for European competition, Hibs entered the 2012–13 Scottish League Cup in the second round. They were drawn away to Second Division club Queen of the South. Hibs manager Pat Fenlon took a risk by resting key players, including captain James McPake, and this backfired as Queen of the South won 2–0 at Palmerston Park. ===Fixtures=== ;Legend ==Transfers== Kevin Thomson, seen here playing for Middlesbrough, returned to Hibs in March 2013. Hibs narrowly avoided relegation from the Scottish Premier League during the 2011–12 season. To do this, the club signed several players on loan during the January 2012 transfer window, all of whom returned to their parent clubs at the end of the season. After the 5–1 defeat by Hearts in the 2012 Scottish Cup Final, the Hibs board of directors acknowledged the necessity of rebuilding the squad. Pat Fenlon attempted to strengthen the defence by signing goalkeeper Ben Williams and defenders James McPake and Tim Clancy. Later in the window, Fenlon complained that other Scottish clubs, particularly the relaunched Rangers, were outbidding Hibs for players. Fenlon was able to sign veteran Finnish striker Shefki Kuqi to provide an experienced target man. Towards the end of the window, Fenlon commented that he was looking for more midfielders, as he was left without cover during a match against St Mirren. Defender Ryan McGivern was signed on loan from Manchester City on the last day of the window, but Fenlon said afterwards he was still looking to strengthen one area of the squad. He managed to strengthen the central midfield position in September, after signing free agent Tom Taiwo to a two-year deal. Approaching the January transfer window, Fenlon said that his main priority was an attempt to secure the services of the three loaned players (Griffiths, McGivern and Jorge Claros). It was confirmed on 16 January that the deals for Griffiths and McGivern had been extended to the end of the season. Former Hibs player Kevin Thomson, who had been released by Middlesbrough at the end of January, began training with Hibs in February. He signed a short-term contract with Hibs in March, going without salary. ===Players in=== {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;width:98%; text- align:left\\" !Player !From !Fee -  Tim Clancy  Motherwell Free -  James McPake  Coventry City Free -  Paul Cairney  Partick Thistle Free -  Ben Williams  Colchester United Free -  Gary Deegan  Coventry City Undisclosed -  Alan Maybury  St Johnstone Free -  Shefki Kuqi  Oldham Athletic Free -  Tom Taiwo  Carlisle United Free -  Sean Murdoch  Accrington Stanley Free -  Scott Robertson  Blackpool Free -  Kevin Thomson  Middlesbrough Free - } ===Players out=== {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;width:98%; text-align:left\\" !Player !To !Fee -  Ian Murray  Dumbarton (player/manager)  Free -  Scott Taggart  Greenock Morton  Free -   Partick Thistle  Free -  Graham Stack  Barnet  Free -  Garry O'Connor  Tom Tomsk  Free -  Isaiah Osbourne  Blackpool  Undisclosed -  Mark Brown  Ross County  Free -  Phil Addison  Berwick Rangers  Free -  Marc Lancaster  Berwick Rangers  Free -  David Stephens  Barnet  Free -  Sean O'Hanlon  Carlisle United  Free -  Ivan Sproule  Ross County  Free -  Danny Galbraith  Limerick  Free - } ===Loans in=== {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;width:75%; text-align:left\\" !Player !From -  Leigh Griffiths  Wolverhampton Wanderers -  Ryan McGivern  Manchester City -  Matt Done  Barnsley - } ===Loans out=== {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;width:75%; text-align:left\\" !Player !To -  Martin Scott  Ross County -  Jordon Forster  East Fife -  Scott Smith  East Fife -  Callum Booth  Livingston -  Calum Antell  East Fife -  Harry Monaghan  Annan Athletic -  Scott Smith  Dumbarton -  Sam Stanton  Cowdenbeath -  Euan Smith  Arbroath - } ==Deaths== * 11 July 2012: Bobby Nicol, 76, Hibernian, Barnsley and Berwick Rangers wing half. * October 2012: Jim Rollo, 74, Hibernian, Oldham Athletic, Southport and Bradford City goalkeeper. ==Player statistics== During the 2012–13 season, Hibs used 30 different players in competitive games.

It has also been used as a part of hormone therapy for transgender women. Although estradiol undecylate has been used in the past, it was discontinued and hence is no longer available. The medication has been given by injection into muscle usually once a month. Side effects of estradiol undecylate in men may include breast tenderness, breast development, feminization, sexual dysfunction, infertility, fluid retention, and cardiovascular issues. Estradiol undecylate is a synthetic estrogen and hence is an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is an estrogen ester and a very long-lasting prodrug of estradiol in the body. Because of this, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. An injection of estradiol undecylate has a duration of about 1 to 4 months. Estradiol undecylate was first described in 1953 and was introduced for medical use by 1956. It has been used in Europe as a parenteral estrogen to treat prostate cancer in men, although not as often as polyestradiol phosphate. ==Medical uses== Estradiol undecylate has been used as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy to treat prostate cancer, but has since largely been superseded for this indication by newer agents with fewer adverse effects (e.g., gynecomastia and cardiovascular complications) like analogues and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. It has been assessed for this purpose in a number of clinical studies. It has been used at a dosage of 100 mg every 3 to 4 weeks (or once a month) by intramuscular injection for this indication. Estradiol undecylate has been used to suppress sex drive in sex offenders. It has been used for this indication at a dosage of 50 to 100 mg by intramuscular injection once every 3 to 4 weeks. Estradiol undecylate has also been used to treat breast cancer in women. It has been used in menopausal hormone therapy as well, for instance in the treatment of hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms. Along with estradiol valerate, estradiol cypionate, and estradiol benzoate, estradiol undecylate has been used as an intramuscular estrogen in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women. It has been used at doses of 100 to as much as 800 mg per month by intramuscular injection for this purpose. ===Available forms=== Estradiol undecylate was available as an oil solution for intramuscular injection provided in ampoules at a concentration of 100 mg/mL. ==Contraindications== Contraindications of estrogens include coagulation problems, cardiovascular diseases, liver disease, and certain hormone-sensitive cancers such as breast cancer and endometrial cancer, among others. ==Side effects== Estradiol undecylate and its side effects have been evaluated for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer in a phase III international multicenter randomized controlled trial headed by Jacobi and colleagues of the Department of Urology, University of Mainz. The study consisted of 191 patients from 12 treatment centers, who were treated for 6 months with intramuscular injections of either 100 mg/month estradiol undecylate (96 men) or 300 mg/week cyproterone acetate (95 men). Findings for a subgroup of 42 men at the University of Mainz center were initially reported in 1978 and 1980. These men were age 51 to 84 years (mean 68 years), and men with pre-existing cardiovascular disease were excluded. A considerable incidence of cardiovascular complications was reported for the estradiol undecylate group (76%; 16/21 incidence total); there was a 67% (14/21) incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and a 9.5% (2/21) incidence of cardiovascular mortality. The cardiovascular morbidity in this group included peripheral edema and superficial thrombophlebitis (38%; 8/21), coronary heart disease (24%; 5/21), and a deep vein thrombosis (4.8%; 1/21), while the cardiovascular mortality included a myocardial infarction (4.8%; 1/21) and a pulmonary embolism (4.8%; 1/21). Eight of the cases of cardiovascular complications in the estradiol undecylate group, including the two deaths, were regarded as \\"severe\\". Conversely, no incidence of cardiovascular toxicity occurred in the cyproterone acetate comparison group (0%; 0/21). Other side effects of estradiol undecylate included gynecomastia (100%; 21/21) and erectile dysfunction (90%; 19/21). The cardiovascular complications with estradiol undecylate in this relatively small study are in contrast to large and high-quality clinical studies of high-dose polyestradiol phosphate and transdermal estradiol for prostate cancer, in which minimal to no cardiovascular toxicity has been observed. An expanded report of 191 patients, which included the 42 patients from the University of Mainz center plus an additional 149 patients from 11 other centers, was published in 1982. The antitumor effectiveness of estradiol undecylate and cyproterone acetate in this study was equivalent. The rates of improvement, no response, and deterioration were 52%, 41%, and 7% in the estradiol undecylate group and 48%, 44%, and 8% in the cyproterone acetate group, respectively. However, the incidence of a selection of specific side effects, including gynecomastia, breast tenderness, edema, and thrombosis, was significantly lower in the cyproterone acetate group than in the estradiol undecylate group (37% vs. 94%, respectively). Gynecomastia specifically occurred in 13% (12/96) of the patients in the cyproterone acetate group and 77% (73/95) of the patients in the estradiol undecylate group. Erectile dysfunction occurred in \\"essentially all\\" patients in both groups. Leg edema occurred in 18% (17/95) of the estradiol undecylate group and 4.2% (4/96) of the cyproterone acetate group, while the incidences of superficial thrombophlebitis and coronary heart disease both were not described. The incidence of thrombosis was 4.2% (4/95) in the estradiol undecylate group and 5.3% (5/96) in the cyproterone acetate group. There were five deaths in total, three in the estradiol undecylate group and two in the cyproterone acetate group. Two of the deaths in each of the treatment groups were due to cardiovascular events, while the remaining death in the estradiol undecylate group was due to unknown causes. The similar rate of cardiovascular complications besides edema between estradiol undecylate and cyproterone acetate that was observed is in contrast to the initial 42-patient report and to findings with other estrogens, such as diethylstilbestrol and estramustine phosphate, which have been shown to possess significantly higher cardiovascular toxicity than cyproterone acetate. On the basis of the expanded study, the researchers concluded that cyproterone acetate was an \\"acceptable alternative\\" to estrogen therapy with estradiol undecylate, but with a \\"considerably more favorable\\" side-effect profile. After the completion of the initial expanded study, a 5-year extension trial primarily of the Ruhr University Bochum center subgroup, led by Tunn and colleagues, was conducted. In this study, the cyproterone acetate group was changed from intramuscular injections to 100 mg/day oral cyproterone acetate. Of the 39 patients in the study, the global 5-year survival rate was not significantly different between the estradiol undecylate and cyproterone acetate groups (24% and 26%, respectively). In patients without metastases, the 5-year survival rate was 51% in the cyproterone acetate group relative to 43% in the estradiol undecylate group, although the difference was not statistically significant. In terms of non-prostate cancer deaths, there were 5 in the CPA group and 6 in the EU group. The incidence of cardiovascular- related mortality was 3 deaths in the CPA group and 3 deaths in the EU group. Side effects during therapy with massive doses of estradiol undecylate in women with advanced breast cancer have included appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, nipple pigmentation, breast pain, rash, urinary incontinence, edema, drowsiness, hypercalcemia, and local injection-site reactions. Like other estrogens, estradiol undecylate has been found to produce testicular abnormalities and disturbances of spermatogenesis in men. ==Overdose== Estradiol undecylate has been used clinically at massive doses of as much as 800 to 2,400 mg per month by intramuscular injection, given in divided doses of 100 to 200 mg per injection two to three times per week. For purposes of comparison, a single 100 mg intramuscular injection of estradiol undecylate has been found to produce maximal estradiol levels of about 500 pg/mL. Symptoms of estrogen overdosage may include nausea, vomiting, bloating, increased weight, water retention, breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, heavy legs, and leg cramps. These side effects can be diminished by reducing the estrogen dosage. ==Interactions== Inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 may influence the metabolism of estradiol and by extension circulating estradiol levels. ==Pharmacology== Estradiol, the active form of estradiol undecylate. ===Pharmacodynamics=== Esters of estradiol like estradiol undecylate are readily hydrolyzed prodrugs of estradiol, but have an extended duration when administered in oil via intramuscular injection due to a depot effect afforded by their fatty acid ester moiety. As prodrugs of estradiol, estradiol undecylate and other estradiol esters are estrogens. Estradiol undecylate is of about 62% higher molecular weight than estradiol due to the presence of its C17β undecylate ester. Because estradiol undecylate is a prodrug of estradiol, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. The effects of estradiol undecylate on cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, testosterone, and prolactin levels as well as on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis have been studied in men with prostate cancer and compared with those of high-dose cyproterone acetate therapy. The effects of estradiol undecylate on serum lipids and ceruloplasmin levels have been studied as well. Antigonadotropic activity Testosterone levels with 300 mg/week cyproterone acetate or 100 mg/month estradiol undecylate both by intramuscular injection. The solid lines are the average levels and the dashed lines are the highest and lowest observed levels. Estradiol, testosterone, and prolactin levels with 100 mg/month estradiol undecylate by intramuscular injection in men with prostate cancer. A phase III clinical trial comparing high-dose intramuscular cyproterone acetate (300 mg/week) and high-dose intramuscular estradiol undecylate (100 mg/month) in the treatment of prostate cancer found that estradiol undecylate suppressed testosterone levels into the castrate range (< 50 ng/dL) within at least 3 months whereas testosterone levels with cyproterone acetate were significantly higher and above the castrate range even after 6 months of treatment. With estradiol undecylate, testosterone levels fell from 416 ng/dL to 38 ng/mL (-91%) after 3 months and to 29.6 ng/dL (-93%) after 6 months, whereas with cyproterone acetate, testosterone levels fell from 434 ng/dL to 107 ng/mL (-75%) at 3 months and to 102 ng/mL (-76%) at 6 months. In another study using the same dosages, estradiol undecylate suppressed testosterone levels by 97% while CPA suppressed them by 70%. In accordance, whereas estrogens are well- established as able to suppress testosterone levels into the castrate range at sufficiently high dosages, progestogens like cyproterone acetate on their own are able to decrease testosterone levels only up to an apparent maximum of around 70 to 80%. The long-term effects of estradiol undecylate on testicular morphology in transgender women have been studied. ===Pharmacokinetics=== The pharmacokinetics of estradiol undecylate have been assessed in a few studies. Following a single intramuscular injection of 100 mg estradiol undecylate in oil, mean levels of estradiol were about 500 pg/mL a day after injection and about 340 pg/mL 14 days after injection. Levels of estradiol with intramuscular estradiol undecylate were reported to be very irregular and to vary by as much as 10-fold between individuals. In another study, following a single intramuscular injection of 32.2 mg estradiol undecylate, levels of estradiol peaked at around 400 pg/mL after 3 days and decreased from this peak to around 200 pg/mL after 6 days. In a continuous administration study of 100 mg/month estradiol undecylate, estradiol levels were about 560 pg/mL at 3 months and about 540 pg/mL at 6 months of therapy. Due to its more protracted duration, doses of estradiol undecylate that are typical of other estradiol esters produce only \\"subthreshold\\" estradiol levels, and for this reason, higher single doses of estradiol undecylate are necessary for similar effects. However, the relatively low levels of estradiol produced by lower doses of estradiol undecylate are favorable for menopausal replacement therapy. The duration of estradiol undecylate is markedly prolonged relative to that of estradiol benzoate, estradiol valerate, and many other estradiol esters. A single intramuscular injection of 10 to 12.5 mg estradiol undecylate has a duration of 40 to 60 days (~1–2 months) and of 25 to 50 mg estradiol undecylate has an estimated duration of effect of 2 to 4 months in postmenopausal women. A single intramuscular injection of 20 to 30 mg estradiol undecylate has been found to inhibit ovulation when used as an estrogen-only injectable contraceptive in premenopausal women for 1 to 3 months (mean 1.7 months) as well. When used at a higher dose of 100 mg per injection in men with prostate cancer, estradiol undecylate has been given usually once a month. After a single subcutaneous injection of estradiol undecylate in rats, its duration of effect was 80 days (about 2.5 months). Due to its very prolonged duration, estradiol undecylate has been described in general as a favorable alternative to estradiol implants. The excretion of estradiol undecylate has been studied as well. Estradiol undecylate has not been used via oral administration. However, a closely related estradiol ester, estradiol decanoate (estradiol decylate), has been studied via the oral route, and has been found to possess significant oral bioavailability, to produce relatively high estradiol levels of about 100 pg/mL after a single 0.5 mg oral dose and about 100 to 150 pg/mL with continuous 0.25 mg/day oral therapy, and to have a much higher estradiol-to-estrone ratio than oral estradiol of about 2:1. It is thought that this is due to absorption of estradiol decanoate by the lymphatic system and a consequent partial bypass of first-pass metabolism in the liver and intestines, which is similarly known to occur with oral testosterone undecanoate. ==Chemistry== Estradiol undecylate is a synthetic estrane steroid and an estradiol ester. It is specifically the C17β undecylate (undecanoate) ester of estradiol. The compound is also known as estradiol 17β-undecylate or as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol 17β-undecanoate. The undecylic acid (undecanoic acid) ester of estradiol undecylate is a medium- chain fatty acid and is found naturally in many foods, some examples of which include coconut, fruits, fats, oils, and rice. Estradiol undecylate is a relatively long-chain ester of estradiol. Its undecylate ester contains 11 carbon atoms. For comparison, the ester chains of estradiol acetate, estradiol valerate, and estradiol enantate have 2, 5, and 7 carbon atoms, respectively. As a result of its longer ester chain, estradiol undecylate is the most lipophilic of these estradiol esters, and for this reason, has by far the longest duration when administered in oil solution by intramuscular injection. A few estradiol esters related to estradiol undecylate include estradiol decanoate, estradiol diundecylate, and estradiol diundecylenate. Estradiol undecylate shares the same undecylate ester as testosterone undecanoate, an androgen/anabolic steroid and very long-lasting testosterone ester. The experimental octanol/water partition coefficient (logP) of estradiol undecylate is 9.5. Estradiol undecylate is one of the highest steroid esters that has been in common use. ==History== Estradiol undecylate was first described in the scientific literature, along with estradiol valerate and a variety of other estradiol esters, by Karl Junkmann of Schering AG in 1953. It was introduced for medical use via intramuscular injection by 1956. Syntex applied for a patent for estradiol undecylate in 1958, which was granted in 1961 and was given a priority date of 1957. Estradiol undecylate was introduced for medical use and was employed for decades, but was eventually discontinued. It remained in use in some countries as late as the 2000s. Harry Benjamin reported on the use of estradiol undecylate in transgender women in his book The Transsexual Phenomenon in 1966 and in a literature review in the Journal of Sex Research in 1967. ==Society and cultureGeneric names=== Estradiol undecylate is the generic name of the drug and its and . It is also spelled in some publications as estradiol unducelate and is also known as estradiol undecanoate. In German, it is known under a variety of spellings including as estradiolundecylat, östradiolundecylat, östradiolundezylat, oestradiolundecylat, oestradiolundezylat, and others. Estradiol undecylate is known by its former developmental code names RS-1047 and SQ-9993 as well. ===Brand names=== The major brand name of estradiol undecylate is Progynon Depot 100. It has also been marketed under other brand names including Delestrec, Depogin, Estrolent, Oestradiol D, Oestradiol-Retard Theramex, and Primogyn Depot [0,1 mg/ml], among others. ===Availability=== Estradiol undecylate was available in the Europe (including in France, Germany, Great Britain, Monaco, the Netherlands, Switzerland), and Japan.Bishop, P. M. F. (1958). Endocrine Treatment of Gynaecological Disorders. Modern Trends in Endocrinology, 231. p. 232 However, it has been discontinued and hence is no longer available. ==Research== Estradiol undecylate was studied by Schering alone as an estrogen-only injectable contraceptive at a dose of 20 to 30 mg once a month. It was effective, lacked breast and thromboembolic complications, lacked other side effects besides amenorrhea, and prevented ovulation for 1 to 3 months (mean 1.7 months) following a single dose. However, uterine growth of 1 to 2 cm was observed after one year, and endometrial hyperplasia was occasionally encountered. The preparation was not further developed as a form of birth control due to the risks of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer associated with long-term unopposed estrogen therapy. Estradiol undecylate, in combination with norethisterone enantate (at doses of 5 to 10 mg and 50 to 70 mg, respectively), was studied by Schering as a combined injectable contraceptive and was found to be effective and well- tolerated, but ultimately was not marketed for this use.Beck, L. R., Cowsar, D. R., & Pope, V. Z. (1980). Long-acting steroidal contraceptive systems.

For such systems it is possible to undertake a starring process, in which the carbon atoms are divided into two sets: all the carbons in one set are marked with a star such that no two starred or unstarred atoms are bonded to each other. Here the starred set contains the highest number of atoms. When this condition is met, the secular determinant in the Hückel approximation has a simpler form, since cross-diagonal elements between atoms in the same set are necessarily 0. Alternant hydrocarbons display three very interesting properties: *The molecular orbital energies for the π system are paired, that is for an orbital of energy E=\\\\alpha +x\\\\beta there is one of energy E=\\\\alpha-x\\\\beta. *The coefficients of two paired molecular orbitals are the same at the same site, except for a sign change in the unstarred set. *The population or electron density at all sites is equal to unity in the ground state, so the distribution of π electrons is uniform across the whole molecule. Moreover, if the alternant hydrocarbon contains an odd number of atoms then there must be an unpaired orbital with zero bonding energy (a non-bonding orbital). For this orbital, the coefficients on the atomic sites can be written down without calculation: the coefficient on all the orbitals belonging to the smaller (unstarred) set are 0, and the sum of the coefficients of the (starred) orbitals around them must also be 0. Simple algebra allows the assignment of all coefficients and then normalize them. This procedure permits the prediction of reactivity patterns and can be exploited to calculate Dewar's reactivity numbers for all sites. == References == Category:Theoretical chemistry Category:Molecular physics ","title":"Alternant hydrocarbon"},{"id":"35885693","text":"Alfredo Horacio Núñez Mendoza (16 February 1960 – 15 March 2008) was a Chilean footballer.

The conference ended football competition in 1914, but some sports, such as wrestling, continued through at least 1917. ==Conference HistoryEstablishment=== Thomas Franklin Kane, president of the University of Washington, was named the temporary chair of the NIAA at its founding meeting in 1902. The Northwest Intercollegiate Athletic Association was established at a conference held in Spokane, Washington on October 11, 1902.\\"League of Colleges,\\" Spokane Daily Chronicle, vol. 17, no. 34 (Oct. 11, 1902), p. 1. Delegates from eight leading colleges of the Pacific Northwest region, including three university presidents, gathered in the directors' rooms of the Spokane Athletic Club and resolved to establish a new governing body for intercollegiate athletic competition. One of the schools present at the founding session, Pacific University, ultimately decided not to affiliate with the new group.\\"Discuss Athletics at Forest Grove,\\" Oregon Daily Journal [Portland], vol. 2, no. 294 (Feb. 16, 1904), p. 2. The University of Oregon was not represented by a delegate at the October 11 foundation meeting but voted to join in December 1902, bringing the total to eight institutions in the new federation.\\"Adopts New System of Athletic Control,\\" Eugene Morning Register, vol. 9, no. 106 (Dec. 7, 1902), p. 5. The new body was designed to establish uniform eligibility rules for college athletics, to resolve such disputes as may emerge, and to schedule competitions between member schools in both athletics and debate. Thomas Franklin Kane, president of the University of Washington, was chosen as temporary chair of the new body, with mathematics professor J. E. Bonebright of the University of Idaho provisionally named as secretary. The gathering decided that governance should be through a board elected by the member institutions, with each school electing one member to the board — either a student, faculty member, or alumnus. The Association took a strong position against professionalism, declaring that only bona fide students of true amateur status should be entitled to participate in intercollegiate competition. It was hoped that this would bring to an end the use of infiltrating skilled ringers into collegiate competition, a practice already recognized to be a bane upon college sports. Sports championships were to be arranged by the governing board. ===Development and decline=== At the NIAA's 1903 annual meeting, held in Moscow, Idaho on Saturday, June 6, J.E. Bonebright was elected president of the association for the coming year, with a new secretary tapped from Oregon Agricultural College.\\"Big Field Meet,\\" vol. 30, no. 73 (June 8, 1903), p. 6. The 1903 conclave announced the scheduling of a massive regional track and field meet, to be held in Walla Walla, Washington on the campus of Whitman College, including participants from ten schools. Sailing was not smooth for the new association, however. By the summer of 1905, the University of Oregon had left the Northwest Conference, with other members divided over the issue of whether athletes could earn tuition money playing baseball for pay during the summer months.\\"To Make Change In Its Rules,\\" Daily Missoulan, vol. 32, no. 116 (Aug. 29, 1905), p. 2. The Association seems to have attenuated in strength an influence, with the Spokane Chronicle observing in November 1905 that \\"there has been considerable talk about the Northwest Intercollegiate Association being a dead one, but the various college games this season would indicate that it is still very much alive...\\"\\"President Bryan on Athletics,\\" Spokane Chronicle, vol. 12, no. 57(Nov. 7, 1905), p. 5. ===Reorganization=== Despite protestations of its vitality, it is clear that by the end of 1907 the Northwest Intercollegiate Athletic Association had become moribund. In January 1908 officials at Whitman College called a conference of seven primary athletics-oriented universities in the region to reform a new intercollegiate athletics association.\\"Conference Is Meeting Today,\\" Oregon Daily Journal [Portland], vol. 6, no. 290 (Feb. 7, 1908), p. 12. Each school was represented by two delegates at the Walla Walla conference — one representing the faculty and another representing the student body. The gathering was attended by six colleges — Idaho, Washington, Washington State, Oregon, Oregon Agricultural, and Whitman. A seventh institution, the University of Montana, was apparently invited to the reorganizational meeting\\"Purify College Athletics,\\" Walla Walla Evening Statesman, Jan. 16, 1908, p. 4. but apparently did not attend. At a two-day conference in Walla Walla, February 7–8, 1908, discussions on a broad range of topics were planned, including the eligibility of those participating in paid summer baseball, the development of a combined football schedule, and establishment of regional meets for track and field and debate. Rules for athletic participation including a one-year residence requirement and four year total of eligibility were also said to be promoted at the meeting by some participants. The February 1908 conference in Walla Walla generated a binding set of rules for the six member schools for the 1908–09 and 1909-10 academic years.\\"The Best of Feeling Prevailed at Intercollegiate Conference,\\" Eugene Morning Register, vol. 19, no. 115 (Feb. 11, 1908), p. 5. These included a four-year limit on athletic participation and a requirement that students transferring into member schools would not be eligible for athletic participation until they had been in attendance for one college year. The question of semi-professional summer baseball was to be left to the decision by athletic committees of each institution. Rationalization of the football schedule was particularly desired, with the hope expressed that the newly rejuvenated conference would \\"either take control of, or in some way influence the arrangement of football schedules so that the northwest championship may be definitely decided each year, instead of leaving the schedule-making to a haphazard choice by individual managers.\\" This aspiration was not to be achieved, however, and irregular scheduling among conference schools remained the norm until establishment of the Pacific Coast Conference in 1915. ==Member Institutions== {  - !

Although widely used in the past, estradiol dipropionate has largely been discontinued and is mostly no longer available today. It appears to remain in use only in Japan, Macedonia, and Australia. Estradiol dipropionate is given by injection into muscle at intervals ranging from once or twice a week to once every week and a half to two weeks. Side effects of estradiol dipropionate include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, nausea, headache, and fluid retention. Estradiol dipropionate is a synthetic estrogen and hence is an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. It is an estrogen ester and a prodrug of estradiol in the body. Because of this, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. Estradiol dipropionate was patented in 1937 and was introduced for medical use by 1940. It was one of the earliest estradiol esters to be used. Along with estradiol benzoate, estradiol dipropionate was among the most widely used esters of estradiol for many years following its introduction. ==Medical uses== The medical uses of estradiol dipropionate are the same as those of estradiol and other estrogens. Estradiol dipropionate is used in hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal atrophy and in the treatment of hypoestrogenism and delayed puberty due to hypogonadism or other causes in women. It is also used in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women. Aside from hormone therapy, estradiol dipropionate is used in the treatment of gynecological disorders such as menstrual disorders, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and breast engorgement. In addition, it is used as a form of high- dose estrogen therapy in the palliative treatment of prostate cancer in men. Estradiol dipropionate has typically been used at a dosage of 1 to 5 mg once or twice per week by intramuscular injection for relevant indications. It has been used in the treatment of menopausal symptoms at a dosage of 1 to 5 mg initially for two to three injections and 1 to 2.5 mg for maintenance once every 10 to 14 days, and in the treatment of hypoestrogenism and delayed puberty at a dosage of 2.5 to 5 mg once per week. As a component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women, estradiol dipropionate has been used at dosages of 2 to 10 mg once per week or 5 to 20 mg once every 2 weeks. In the treatment of prostate cancer, estradiol dipropionate has been used at a dosage of 5 mg once per week. ===Available forms=== Estradiol dipropionate was previously available by itself as an oil solution for intramuscular injection provided as vials and ampoules at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 mg/mL. The medication has largely been discontinued, with most of these formulations no longer being available. Estradiol dipropionate remains available at a concentration of 1 mg/mL in combination with 50 mg/mL hydroxyprogesterone caproate under the brand name EP Hormone Depot (Teikoku Zoki Pharmaceutical Company) in Japan. ==Contraindications== Contraindications of estrogens include coagulation problems, cardiovascular diseases, liver disease, and certain hormone-sensitive cancers such as breast cancer and endometrial cancer, among others. ==Side effects== The side effects of estradiol dipropionate are the same as those of estradiol. Examples of such side effects include breast tenderness and enlargement, nausea, bloating, edema, headache, and melasma. ==Overdose== Symptoms of estrogen overdosage may include nausea, vomiting, bloating, increased weight, water retention, breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, heavy legs, and leg cramps. These side effects can be diminished by reducing the estrogen dosage. ==Interactions== Inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 may influence the metabolism of estradiol and by extension circulating estradiol levels. ==Pharmacology== Estradiol, the active form of estradiol dipropionate. ===Pharmacodynamics=== Estradiol dipropionate is an estradiol ester, or a prodrug of estradiol. As such, it is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors. Estradiol dipropionate is of about 41% higher molecular weight than estradiol due to the presence of its C3 and C17β propionate esters. Because estradiol dipropionate is a prodrug of estradiol, it is considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen. ===Pharmacokinetics=== Compared to estradiol benzoate, a related estradiol ester, estradiol dipropionate has enhanced and prolonged effects. Whereas the duration of action of estradiol benzoate is said to be 2 to 3 days, the duration of estradiol dipropionate has been said to be 1 to 2 weeks. However, newer estradiol esters have longer durations than either estradiol benzoate or estradiol dipropionate; the duration of estradiol valerate has been said to be 1 to 3 weeks, and the duration of estradiol cypionate has been said to be 3 to 4 weeks. A single intramuscular injection of 5 mg estradiol dipropionate has a duration of about 5 to 8 days. A single intramuscular injection of 50 μg/kg estradiol dipropionate in oil in 15 pubertal girls (about 1 mg for a 50-kg (110-lb) girl) was found to produce peak estradiol levels of about 215 pg/mL after 1.5 days. Estradiol levels declined to about 90 pg/mL after 4 days. ==Chemistry== Estradiol dipropionate, also known as estradiol 3,17β-dipropionate, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol. It is an estrogen ester; specifically, it is the C3,17β dipropionate ester of estradiol. The experimental octanol/water partition coefficient (logP) of estradiol dipropionate is 4.9.http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.7932.html ==History== Estradiol dipropionate was first synthesized and patented in 1937. It was assessed in clinical studies by 1939 and was introduced by Ciba as an oil solution for use by intramuscular injection under the brand name Di-Ovocylin by the same year. Other formulations such as Ovocyclin P by Ciba, Progynon DP by Schering and Dimenformon Dipropionate by Roche-Organon were also marketed by the early 1940s. Later in the 1940s the brand name Di-Ovocylin was changed by Ciba to Ovocylin Dipropionate. Along with estradiol benzoate, which was introduced in 1933, estradiol dipropionate was one of the first estradiol esters to be introduced for medical use. Prior to the development and introduction of longer-acting estradiol esters like estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate in the 1950s, estradiol dipropionate and estradiol benzoate were the most widely used estradiol esters. ==Society and cultureGeneric names=== Estradiol dipropionate is the generic name of the drug and its , , and . ===Brand names=== Estradiol dipropionate has been marketed under a variety of brand names, including Agofollin, Akrofolline, Dihidrofolina \\"Kével\\", Dimenformon, Dimenformon Dipropionate, Diovocylin, Di-Ovocylin, Diprostron, Diprovex, Endofollicolina D.P., EP Hormone Depot (in combination with hydroxyprogesterone caproate), Estroici, Estronex, Follicyclin, Follicyclin P, Follikelmon Depot, Horiken-Depot, Nacyclyl, Oestradiol Galenika, Oestradiol Streuli, Orofollina, Ovacrin, Ovahormon Depot, Ovocylin, Ovocylin Dipropionate, Ovocylin P, and Progynon DP, among others. Agofollin was an oil solution of estradiol dipropionate that was previously marketed in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. ===Availability=== Estradiol dipropionate has been discontinued in most countries, but remains available in Japan and Macedonia alone under the brand names Ovahormon and Oestradiol Galenika and/or in combination with hydroxyprogesterone caproate under the brand name EP Hormone Depot. It is also marketed for use in veterinary medicine in combination with hydroxyprogesterone caproate and nandrolone decanoate under the brand name Reepair in Australia. ==See also== * Estradiol dipropionate/hydroxyprogesterone caproate ==References== Category:Abandoned drugs Category:Antigonadotropins Category:Estradiol esters Category:Estranes Category:Hormonal antineoplastic drugs Category:Prodrugs Category:Propionate esters Category:Synthetic estrogens ","title":"Estradiol dipropionate"},{"id":"35885750","text":"Sergio Armando Marchant Muñoz (17 September 1961 – 15 May 2020) was a Chilean footballer who played as a midfielder. ==References== Category:1961 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Association football midfielders Category:Chilean footballers Category:Olympic footballers of Chile Category:Footballers at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:C.D.

It was produced by Famous Players-Lasky and distributed through Paramount Pictures. William Desmond Taylor directed Huckleberry Finn, as he had the 1917 film version of Tom Sawyer, using a scenario written by Julia Crawford Ivers, who also had been the writer for Tom Sawyer. It was the first version of the story entirely entrusted to a youth cast. Lewis Sargent (Huck) and Gordon Griffith (Tom) were child actors who already had a long and successful career and were well known to the public.Holmstrom, John. The Moving Picture Boy: An International Encyclopaedia from 1895 to 1995, Norwich, Michael Russell, 1996, pp. 21, 30-32. ==Plot== As described in a film publication, Huckleberry Finn (Sargent) has been adopted by the Widow Douglas (K. Griffith) who plans to \\"civilize\\" him. With Tom Sawyer (G. Griffith) he forms a robber gang, and in a cave has the local boys take an oath to stick together. In his bedroom he runs into his no-account father (Lanning) who steals Huck's small change and later kidnaps Huck, taking him in a small boat down the river, while Tom and the gang wait for their leader to appear. Huck later escapes from a cabin where his father mistreated him, making it look as if he drowned while getting away in a canoe. Rumors of Huck's death spreads. Jim (Reed), the widow's slave boy, hears that he is to be sold and runs off, and joins Huck on a raft. Duke (Humphrey) and King (Bates), two broken-down actors fleeing a crowd they had fooled with a mock theatrical performance, join them. At the next town the actors again fool the people with a pretend theatrical performance with Huck acting as the doorkeeper. Further downstream the actors then impersonate the brothers of a deceased man named Wilks in an attempt to obtain the inheritance, but Huck takes the money to keep it from the actors after he is smitten by the daughter, Mary Jane Wilks (Ralston). Huck and Jim leave to escape the wrath of their former companions just as the actual relatives of the dead man show up. After peace is made when King and Duke rejoin the group, a shabby trick is performed when King sells Jim to a man named Phelps and then tells Huck that Jim has been lost. Upon learning the truth, Huck sets out to rescue his friend. He discovers that Mrs. Phelps (Moore) is the sister of Tom's Aunt Polly. Huck poses as the nephew Tom, whom Mrs. Phelps has never met. Then the real Tom arrives, who is surprised as he believed that Huck had died. After exchanging signals, Tom poses as his brother Sid and they go through with a plan. In a struggle to get Jim away, Tom is shot in the leg. Jim escapes, and while the two youngsters are congratulating themselves at Tom's sickbed, Aunt Polly arrives and says that Jim had been freed a month earlier. She informs the Phelps of Huck's actual identity and takes him back, cured of his wandering, to the Widow Douglas. ==Cast== *Lewis Sargent - Huckleberry Finn *Katherine Griffith - Widow Douglas *Martha Mattox - Miss Watson *Frank Lanning - Huck's father *Orral Humphrey - The Duke *Tom Bates - The King (*as Tom D.

It draws on various philosophical models from On the Genealogy of Morals of Friedrich Nietzsche through Martin Heidegger on das Man, Maurice Merleau-Ponty on the lived body, and Ludwig Wittgenstein on social practices to Michel Foucault on discipline, as well as theories of performativity emerging out of the speech act theory of J.

His goal in importing somatic theory into cognitive linguistics is to show that :the primary purpose of achieving human scale is not to help us apprehend a situation, but rather to help us to know how to feel about it. Especially in political and religious discourse--situations where speakers are attempting to influence their listeners' values and decision-making processes--I would like to argue that the achievement of human scale is intended primarily to import normativity to the blend, which is accomplished through the recruitment of human-scale emotional-somatic reactions. This argument is essentially an attempt to connect of conceptual blending theorists with those of neuroscientists who argue for the importance of somatic states and emotional reactions in human value-creation and decision-making.\\"Conceptual Blending,\\" p. 558. === Douglas Robinson === Douglas Robinson first began developing a somatic theory of language for a keynote presentation at the 9th American Imagery Conference in Los Angeles, October, 1985, based on Ahkter Ahsen's theory of somatic response to images as the basis for therapeutic transformations; in contradistinction to Ahsen's model, which rejected Freud's \\"talking cure\\" on the grounds that words do not awaken somatic responses, Robinson argued that there is a very powerful somatics of language. He later incorporated this notion into The Translator's Turn (1991), drawing on the (passing) somatic theories of William James, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Kenneth Burke in order to argue that somatic response may be \\"idiosomatic\\" (somatically idiosyncratic) but typically is \\"ideosomatic\\" (somatically ideological, or shaped and guided by society), and that the ideosomatics of language explains how language remains stable enough for communication to be possible. This work preceded the Damasio group's first scientific publication on the somatic-marker hypothesis in 1991,Damasio, Antonio R., Daniel Tranel, and Hannah Damasio. (1991). \\"Somatic Markers and the Guidance of Behaviour: Theory and Preliminary Testing.\\" In H.S. Levin, H.M. Eisenberg and A.L. Benton (eds.), Frontal lobe function and dysfunction, 217-229. New York: Oxford University Press and Robinson did not begin to incorporate Damasio's somatic- marker hypothesis into his somatic theory until later in the 1990s. In Translation and Taboo (1996) Robinson drew on the protosomatic theories of Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Gregory Bateson to explore the ways in which the ideosomatics of taboo structure (and partly sanction and conceal) the translation of sacred texts. His first book to draw on Damasio's somatic- marker hypothesis is Performative Linguistics (2003); there he draws on J. L. Austin's theory of speech acts, Jacques Derrida's theory of iterability, and Mikhail Bakhtin's theory of dialogism to argue that performativity as an activity of the speaking body is grounded in somaticity. He also draws on Daniel Simeoni's application of Pierre Bourdieu's theory of habitus in order to argue that his somatics of translation as developed in The Translator's Turn actually explains translation norms more fully than Gideon Toury in Descriptive Translation Studies and beyond (1995).Amsterdam and Philadelphia: John Benjamins, 1995, pp. 56ff. In 2005 Robinson began writing a series of books exploring somatic theory in different communicative contexts: modernist/formalist theories of estrangement (Robinson 2008), translation as ideological pressure (Robinson 2011), first-year writing (Robinson 2012), and the refugee experience, (de)colonization, and the intergenerational transmission of trauma (Robinson 2013).See Further Reading for bibliographical information. In Robinson's articulation, somatic theory has four main planks: # the stabilization of social constructions through somatic markers # the interpersonal sharing of such stabilizations through the mimetic somatic transfer # the regulatory (ideosomatic) circulation or reticulation of such somatomimeses through an entire group in the somatic exchange # the \\"klugey\\" nature of social regulation through the somatic exchange, leading to various idiosomatic failures and refusals to be fully regulated In addition, he has added concepts along the way: the proprioception of the body politic as a homeostatic balancing between too much familiarity and too much strangeness (Robinson 2008); tensions between loconormativity and xenonormativity, the exosomatization of places, objects, and skin color, and paleosomaticity (Robinson 2013); ecosis and icosis (unpublished work). === Stephanie Fetta === Stephanie Fetta is Associate Professor of Latin@/x Literature and Culture at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Stephanie Fetta’s approach to somatic theory weaves together an extensive array of disciplinary discourses, ranging from cognitive science and neuroscience to sociology and Sophiology. As a literary and cultural critic, Fetta draws attention to and investigates the role of the soma in her study of US Latin@/x creative texts.Stephanie Fetta uses the term Latin@/x when referring to someone who is native to or descends from a Latin American or Spanish-speaking Caribbean country for the following reasons: first, this term does not reinforce the historic connotations of colonialization nor comply with governmental attempts to classify non-hegemonic persons into deceptive categories like the term Hispanic does; second, the @ does not overlook historical struggles for gender equity; third, the suffix x acknowledges the existence of gender fluidity and non-binary sexual identities. Her scholarly work broadens the scope of somatic theory and literary scholarship by drawing support from the natural and social sciences to position the soma as a “psychobiological agent” and social actor, and thus an overlooked (albeit indispensable) lens in the study of social power (2018, 37). Building on both biblical and contemporary uses of the term, Fetta reconceptualizes the soma as ‘the emotional, intelligent and communicative body’ and explains that it refers to the gestures of the physical body in internal response to external social pressures. Hence, she is one of the first somatic theorists to employ the term soma along these lines—despite the current spate of studies in neurology, cognitive literary studies, behavioral science, body studies, affect theory, theories of mind (ToM) and philosophy of mind (PoM) which piece together the connections among cognitive processes, bodily feeling reactions, and evaluative perceptions. In 2018, she published _Shaming into Brown: Somatic Transactions of Race in Latina/o Literature_ Published by Ohio State University Press as part of the Cognitive Approaches to Culture series. Awarded the 2019 Modern Language Association Prize in United States Latina and Latino and Chicana and Chicano Literary and Cultural Studies., a detailed and analytic transdisciplinary study which renders the soma as “a pervasive yet unexpected site of subjectivity,” one she employs as a primary tool to investigate intersectional racialization and the transactions of race in her case studies of Latin@/x literature (xiii). This book develops somatic analysis as a line of investigation, which reviewers hold has applications in fields as diverse as the humanities, critical race theory, neurology, behavioral studies, and so on. Somatic analysis has inspired and been cited in a growing number of academic, personalSee: Delgado, Richard. (2019.) \\"Metamorphosis: A Minority Professor's Life.\\" _UC Davis Law Review_ , 53.1: 1-33. Aldama, Frederick Luis. (2019.) \\"PUTTING A FINGER TO THE VIBRANT BEAT OF LATINX LITERARY STUDIES TODAY.\\" _Latinx Spaces_., and artistic works Artistic works include Kathy Davalos's performance at the MALCS Conference, July 2019.. Fetta’s key applications of somatic analysis are as follows: * **Racial Shaming** : a social technology that uses the somatic body to materialize Brown into social fact. Her thesis is anchored in two psychoanalytic theories, bioenergetic analysis developed by Alexander Lowen and affect theory put forth by Silvan Tomkins. * **Scenes of Racialization:** a stepped social practice in which “bodies impose social asymmetries through somatic expression” (2018, xv). Fetta identifies four steps, or somatic sequences, through which the notion of race conditions personal and intersubjective interactions. The racializer begins by (1) identifying phenotypic and somatic cues as a reason to stymie somatic mirroring and withdraw interpersonal rapport with the racialized interlocutor, blocking any sort of empathy toward her or him. This leads in turn to (2) social rejection and somatic dissonance, which functions as a source of shame. In line with Damasio’s somatic marker hypothesis, she argues (3) **socially and culturally crafted sensory scripts** are applied, (4) completing the process of racialization with a **somatic expression of disgust** , as registered through the senses (vision, audition and olfaction). * **Internal Soma:** Fetta examines racialization from the perspective of the somatic interior body. In her case study of Oscar ‘Zeta’ Acosta’s _Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo_ (1972), she takes heed of the parallels between Oscar’s struggle with internalized self-loathing and his nonconforming somatic stomach.Fetta, Stephanie. (2016.) \\"A Bad Attitude and A Bad Stomach: The Soma in Oscar 'Zeta' Acosta’s The Autobiography of a Brown Buffalo.\\" _TRANSMODERNITY: Journal of Peripheral Cultural Production of the Luso- Hispanic World_ , 6.1: 89-109. * **Somatic Portrayal:** a process relied on by successful Method actors, in which actors must override their own somatic expression by inhabiting and portraying the soma of their character. Fetta further complicates the performance goal of Method acting’s purportedly real somatic portrayal and contends that such portrayal may “rub up against another style of acting [she] refers to as _body image management_ […] which lacks the naturalness of lived somatic expression” (2018, 95). Extended to the concept of magic _o_ nanny, somatic performance is exacted of social inferiors, whose true somatic expression could betray vulnerability to shaming or even violenceThe concept of magic _o_ nanny builds off of Frederick Luis Aldama’s term _magicorealism_ argued in _Postethnic Narrative Criticism_ (University of Texas Press, 2003) in critique of magical realism. * **The Soma and Sophia:** Fetta also (re)introduces Sophia, the second figure in certain Christian trinities, to literary analysis and somatic theory. She explains that Andres Montoya’s poetry collection _The Ice Worker Sings and Other Poems_ (1999) provides another vision of the soma—a spiritual or divine soma, one that transforms pain, suffering, and sin through the sacred figure of Sophia. Thereby, she claims that Sophia is not only a biblical figure, but also a powerful analytic of the divine soma. == References  Further reading == * Damasio, Antonio R. (1994).

The actor relocated to Melbourne to film his scenes and his casting was announced in March 2011. He had a seven-week guest contract. Brummer revealed that his turn in Underbelly: A Tale of Two Cities caught the attention of the Neighbours producers and they later offered him the role of Troy. He also stated that the part made him enjoy acting again, after being away from the industry for several years. Brummer made his first screen appearance as Troy during the episode broadcast on 10 May. Before his arrival on screen, it was revealed Troy was Sonya Mitchell's (Eve Morey) ex-boyfriend and the biological father of Callum Jones (Morgan Baker). Troy is an ex-army officer and a complex character. He initially appears nice on the surface, but there is a dark side to him. Brummer revealed that Troy does not intentionally set out to stir up trouble, but aspects of his personality often cause problems. He later stated that Troy knows how to push people to his advantage. Troy comes to Erinsborough after being contacted by Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney). He discovers Callum is his son and sets about getting to know him better. He also becomes keen to get back together with Sonya. Troy departed on 8 June 2011 after failing to convince Sonya to start a new life with him. In March 2012, it was announced that Brummer had reprised his role for six weeks. The actor revealed that it took twelve months to come up with the storyline and get him back. Troy purchases a house on Ramsay Street and Brummer stated that he just wants to be a part of Callum's life. Shortly after the character's come back, it was revealed that he was Jade Mitchell's (Gemma Pranita) abusive ex-boyfriend. In June 2012, a two-week-long storyline unfolded in which Troy took Callum, Sonya and Jade hostage, before being badly injured. The character died from a head injury on 3 July 2012, following a dramatic confrontation with his son. ==Casting== On 1 March 2011, a writer for Channel 5's Neighbours website announced Brummer had been cast in the role of Captain Troy Miller. The actor relocated from Sydney to Melbourne, where Neighbours is filmed, for his seven-week guest stint on the soap. Brummer began filming his first scenes the day after his casting was announced. Inside Soap's Jason Herbison revealed Brummer's appearance in Underbelly: A Tale of Two Cities attracted the attentions of the Neighbours producers and they later offered him the role of Troy. The actor told Herbison that he was \\"chuffed\\" when he received the offer and that he was enjoying acting again, after being away from the acting industry for a while. Brummer added his Neighbours role allowed him the opportunity to work alongside his friend, Scott Major (Lucas Fitzgerald). Of Brummer's casting, the show's executive producer Susan Bower commented \\"We are delighted that Dieter is joining us and we're very excited about the character he is playing. The Captain will certainly leave his mark on Ramsay Street.\\" Brummer made his debut screen appearance as Troy on 10 May 2011. ==DevelopmentBackstory and characterisation=== Troy is Sonya Mitchell's (Eve Morey) ex-boyfriend and the biological father of Callum Jones (Morgan Baker). Brummer revealed that when Troy and Sonya were together, they were going through a dark time in their lives. Explaining Troy and Sonya's relationship further, Brummer stated \\"I think he would have been more dedicated to Sonya and their relationship in the past if he'd known that she decided to keep their baby. He has never really let go of Sonya. For whatever reason they finally decided to break up and neither one of them was in a great place at the time. Then he left to join the army.\\" The actor believed that it was not easy for the former couple to confront their past. Brummer commented that Troy had been through many changes since his relationship with Sonya. Speaking to a Channel 5 website reporter, the actor said Troy stands up for himself, though \\"he will turn like a cut snake if he's crossed.\\" Brummer called Troy \\"a complex character\\", who initially appears nice on the surface. However, there is another side to him. A writer for Channel 5 observed that not everyone in Erinsborough would be ready to welcome Troy. They described him as a \\"sexy soldier\\", who was guaranteed to see a lot of heavy combat during his time on the show. Brummer told a TV Week reporter that Troy does not intentionally set out to stir up trouble, but aspects of his personality would cause problems. When asked by a What's on TV journalist if Troy has a nice side, Brummer stated \\"That's an interesting question. His intentions are good from the point-of-view that he wants to be with his son, Callum. However there is some really bad, dark stuff going on with Troy and that overrides any of his positive motives.\\" The actor thought Troy would be a good father to Callum, but only if it was just them together. Speaking about his second stint in Neighbours, Brummer revealed that Troy is \\"a great strategist\\", who knows how to push people to his advantage. He later said \\"When we first saw Troy last year he wasn't aware that he fathered a child to Sonya and after things went a little bit awry towards the end of last year's stint, he'd gone away and spent a bit of time thinking about it and came back.\\" ===Introduction=== Troy comes to Erinsborough after being contacted by Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney). Toadie reveals that he wants to know if Sonya is hiding anything else from him, having just learned she is the mother of his adoptive son, Callum. Troy subsequently learns he is Callum's biological father and Toadie begins to see him as a threat, which Brummer thought was to be expected. Moloney compared the two men to a pair of bulls eyeing each other up and waiting to see who charges first. Susan Hill of the Daily Star commented that Troy initially receives \\"a frosty reception\\" from Sonya. Aware that her relationship with Toadie has broken down, Troy becomes keen to get back together with her. Troy and Sonya share a kiss, which is witnessed by Callum. Moloney told an Inside Soap writer that \\"in a way Toadie paved the way for Troy to come back into Sonya's life - and it looks like he's going to regret that.\\" Just as Toadie learns about the kiss, his friend Harold Bishop (Ian Smith), reveals that he also witnessed Troy and Sonya kissing earlier in the week. Moloney thought that if Sonya and Troy did get back together, then there would be \\"a ready-made family\\" waiting for Callum. Toadie gives Sonya his blessing to move on with Troy, but he later realises that he wants to win her back. A show spokesperson told Hill \\"Troy is a tough army guy. So Toadie has got a real battle on his hands.\\" Troy reveals his \\"true colours\\" when he attends Harold's stag do. He threatens Harold into staying out of his way, by shoving him to one side. Shortly after that incident, Toadie becomes worried when he learns Troy has taken Callum to Puckapunyal. He cannot get a hold of him and the situation briefly brings Toadie and Sonya together. When Troy returns, it is revealed that it was Callum's fault. Moloney told a Channel 5 reporter that Toadie then has a go at Troy, which pushes him and Sonya apart. Following Harold's wedding, Toadie and Sonya decide to get back together. Troy initially takes the news well, but after running into Sonya's sister, Jade (Gemma Pranita), who provokes him with some \\"choice words\\", he snaps. Troy lashes out by punching Toadie and shouting at his son, terrifying him. Troy eventually calms down and feeling remorseful, he contacts Sonya, who agrees to meet him in his hotel room. TV Week's Jackie Brygel and Gavin Scott wrote that it soon becomes clear Troy is still angry, when he refuses to let Sonya leave. Troy tries unsuccessfully to convince her to start a new life with him and he leaves alone. ===Return=== Following Troy's return, it was revealed he had dated and abused Jade Mitchell (played by Gemma Pranita). On 2 March 2012, it was announced that Brummer had reprised his role for a six-week stint. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy confirmed the actor was already back on set filming, but details of his comeback storyline were being kept under wraps. A Neighbours spokesperson told Kilkelly that Troy's return would \\"certainly ruffle feathers in Erinsborough.\\" Brummer commented that he was enjoying being back in Melbourne and that the cast had made him feel at home. Speaking to Seanna Cronin of the Sunshine Coast Daily about his return, Brummer revealed \\"I did the seven-week guestie last year and there was talk about it. It seemed fairly well open. It took 12 months for them to come up with the storyline and bring me back, I had a feeling I'd be back at some point, I was just not sure when.\\" Brummer made a return to Neighbours on 28 May 2012. A Channel 5 website writer said Troy's return storyline was expected to be one of the most dramatic for 2012. Brummer revealed that Troy comes back to be a part of Callum's life, but the way he goes about it does not sit well with some of the residents of Ramsay Street. He purchases Number 32, the house next door to Sonya and Toadie, thinking it could be a way to get closer to his son. Brummer explained to an Inside Soap journalist that Troy insists he is a changed man as he has been through anger management and plans to turn his life around. When Toadie learns Troy is back, he invites him to a meeting in his office, without telling Sonya. He makes it clear to Troy that he does not trust him and he will not be allowed near Callum. Sonya learns Troy is back after Callum lets it slip and she is annoyed that Toadie withheld the news from her. Troy's return causes tension between them. Brummer commented that Sonya does not believe her ex has changed and she warns him to stay away from her son. Troy then announces that he is going to fight Sonya for joint custody of Callum. The actor added Sonya and Toadie are \\"left in no doubt about his determination\\" when they discover he has hired their friend Ajay Kapoor (Sachin Joab) to represent him. Andrew Mercado of TV Week observed Sonya, Toadie and Callum were not the only characters reeling from the news that Troy is back – with Jade also seemingly horrified at his return. In \\"an explosive development\\", it was revealed Troy was Jade's abusive ex-boyfriend who she had mentioned in past discussions with her partner, Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan). Following a confrontation between Toadie and Troy, a pregnant Sonya collapses putting her unborn child's life at risk. Morey commented that she was stressed out just reading the scripts for the scenes. Toadie loses control and punches Troy when he taunts him about Sonya's pregnancy. Troy immediately goes to the police and takes out a restraining order against Toadie. Morey told TV Week's Jackie Brygel and Gavin Scott \\"Sonya sees Troy as the devil incarnate - a man who has only ever wanted harmful things to happen to her. He really epitomises the blackness of Sonya's past and he's affecting everyone she loves.\\" When she hears the news of the order against Toadie, Sonya's body shuts down because of the amount of stress she is under and she collapses. Later at the hospital, Sonya is given the all-clear. ===Siege, departure and death=== In June 2012, a TV Week reporter revealed Troy would take Callum, Sonya and Jade hostage inside his house during a storyline set to play out over two weeks. The reporter explained one of the characters would be left fighting for their life following the \\"must-see episodes\\". Morey commented \\"The stakes get higher and higher every single second. The storyline takes us down this incredible path where you think the situation is bad...but just wait! Give it another five seconds and it'll get much worse.\\" The storyline starts to unfold after Callum confronts Troy about reneging on a deal to have an intervention order against Toadie dropped. Brummer stated that Troy just wants to be back in his son's life, but everyone is making that difficult for him and because no one trusts him, Troy locks Callum inside his house. He refuses to let his son go until his views are heard. Sonya and Jade realise what has happened and they \\"have never been more fearful\\", especially as they know the truth about Troy's history of physical abuse. Morey said that Sonya feels powerless in that moment and when Callum fails to escape, she and Jade burst into the house. Pranita explained that Jade takes on a \\"protective auntie role\\" of looking after Callum. She feels like history is repeating itself and Jade hates Troy more than ever. Of shooting the siege storyline, Pranita told the reporter \\"It was so out of the norm to the drama that we shoot day to day. This was a really heightened scenario where you're being held captive in a house against your will, while trying to protect your family. It was so intense and we felt like we had a dark cloud hanging over us for a few weeks.\\" Pranita added that Brummer's acting made it easy to be scared of Troy. The TV Week reporter wrote that \\"Neighbours takes a leaf out of Desperate Housewives' book\\" when a twist leaves one character severely injured. Morey revealed that where the storyline goes is devastating, dramatic and very sad. Brummer later told Mercado that things would take a shocking turn in the storyline, which leads to Troy's departure from the soap. Troy is taken to the hospital after he hits his head during an altercation with Jade, but he discharges himself and heads to Erinsborough High to see Callum. Morey revealed that Sonya and Toadie are \\"beside themselves\\" when they hear Troy has tried to break into the school. She explained \\"Sonya is absolutely panicked. The thing she's always feared most is Troy doing something to Callum, and now she's terrified he's going to take Callum away, whether Callum likes it or not.\\" A dramatic confrontation erupts in the school and Morey called the scenes \\"uncomfortable to film\\" as they were shooting in a part of the studio they are never in. Callum eventually lashes out at Troy and tells him he does not want to see him ever again. The police start to close in and Troy tries to escape in his car. However he loses consciousness, crashes and never wakes up. Troy's final scenes were broadcast on 3 July 2012. ==Storylines== Troy arrives in Erinsborough looking for Toadfish Rebecchi. He asks Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) if she knows where to find him and they are overheard by Harold Bishop, who takes Troy's phone number to give to Toadie. Troy later goes to Harold's Store and hears Kate and Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major) talking about Sonya Mitchell. Troy asks Lucas for Sonya's address and he surprises her by showing up at her door. Troy tells Sonya and her sister, Jade, that a lawyer called his base a few weeks ago and Sonya's name was mentioned. Troy suddenly remembers Sonya was pregnant when they separated and Sonya admits that she gave birth to their son, Callum. She explains that she did not tell him because he had walked out on her. Troy tells Sonya he has changed since he joined the army and was posted to Afghanistan. He asks to see Callum and a meeting is arranged at Harold's Store. Troy and Callum get on well, but Toadie cuts the meeting short. He later allows Callum to spend the day with Troy. Sonya and Troy reminisce about their past and they later kiss. Harold asks Troy what his intentions towards Sonya are and Carolyn Johnstone (Paula Duncan) offers him money to leave, but Troy states that he just wants to get to know Callum. Troy is invited to Harold's bucks night and he physically threatens Harold, when they are alone. Toadie becomes angry with Troy when he takes Callum to Puckapunyal without permission. Troy explains Callum had sneaked into the back of his car and he did not notice until he stopped for petrol. Troy promises Sonya he will not take off with Callum without permission. Sonya tells Troy she and Toadie have resumed their relationship, which angers him. Jade then goads him and Troy confronts Toadie; punching him in the face. Troy also yells at Callum. Sonya visits Troy at his hotel and he explains that he wants to be a family with her and Callum. Sonya tells him it cannot happen and Troy stops her from leaving. Troy worries that he is going to be shut out of Callum's life, but Sonya reassures him that will not happen and they can arrange to meet next time he is on leave. Troy then reveals that he has been dishonorably discharged from the army. Troy tries to make Sonya have an emotional breakdown, by telling her that Toadie will not accept her. He tempts her with a glass of whiskey, but she states that if he loved her, he would not have done that. Sonya tells him to stay away from her family and she leaves the room. Troy departs Erinsborough alone. A year later, Troy returns and purchases Number 32. Rani Kapoor (Coco Cherian) introduces herself to him and when she mentions she is friends with Callum and his family, Troy tells her he knows the family well. Troy goes to Sonya's Nursery and watches Callum and Sonya working. He later returns home to find Toadie and Callum on his driveway. He states that he just wants to be a part of Callum's life. Toadie offers to buy the house, telling Troy that Callum is afraid of him. Troy explains that he is a changed man after attending anger management classes. Sonya learns Troy has returned and tells him to stay away. Troy then hires Ajay Kapoor to gain access to Callum. Jade confronts Troy about his return, revealing their past relationship in the process. Troy learns Sonya is pregnant and goads Toadie about the child's paternity. When Toadie punches him, Troy calls the police and Toadie is served with an intervention order, which forces him to leave the street. Jade later comes to Troy and reveals she has medical records, proving he hit her when they were together. Jade gives her evidence at the mediation meeting, but Ajay reveals that there is nothing that will alter Troy's application for custody. Troy realises Toadie has broken the intervention order and calls the police. Callum comes to Troy and states that he will spend time with him if he drops the custody case and the intervention order. Troy agrees and he and Callum work on the house renovations. Troy drops the custody case, but reveals he will not drop the order against Toadie until he is sure Callum will keep to the deal. Troy prevents Callum from leaving his house as he wants his son to hear him out. Sonya becomes concerned for Callum and when the door opens, Jade manages to push him out of the house. However, Troy locks the sisters inside and pushes Jade to the floor when she defends Sonya. Troy starts shouting and explains that all he wanted to do was get to know his son. Jade punches him in the stomach and she and Sonya escape. As he chases them, Troy trips and falls, accidentally pulling down a toolbox on top of him. Toadie finds him unconscious, but while he is outside, Troy wakes up and disappears. He goes to the Lassiter's Complex looking for Ajay and collapses. He is taken to the hospital, where he tells Rhys Lawson (Ben Barber) that Jade and Sonya attacked him. He is then placed in an induced coma. When Troy wakes up, he gives a statement to the police confirming that he tripped and Jade was not responsible for his injuries. Ajay tells him that he is no longer his lawyer and Toadie comes to visit, telling him that nothing has changed. Troy discharges himself and goes to Ramsay Street to pack up his stuff. He then heads to the high school to pick up Callum, but Priya Kapoor (Menik Gooneratne) sends him away. However, Troy returns and breaks into the school. He struggles with his head injury, but begins searching the school for Callum. Toadie tells him to stop, but Troy refuses, until Callum tells him to leave. Troy gets in his truck, but collapses at the wheel and dies. ==Reception== A Liverpool Daily Post reporter said Troy was a \\"troubled character\\". The Sunday Mercury's Roz Laws questioned if Troy was the right man for Sonya, adding \\"Not if his nasty behaviour at Harold's stag party is anyting to go by.\\" A writer for TV Week's online website branded Troy a \\"menacing ex\\" and said his return was \\"most unwelcome\\". A reporter for the Herald Sun called him a \\"baddie\\". Andrew Kerby of Only Soaps labelled Troy \\"the archetypal Neighbours nasty\\". He stated \\"Great news to have Dieter back because he plays the character with such verve and passion, but just what is Troy doing coming back? Wait and see – we're sure it is going to be a bumpy ride!\\" A What's on TV reporter labelled Troy a \\"trouble-maker supreme\\" and \\"Ramsay Street's nastiest neighbour!\\" Digital Spy's Paul Millar called Troy \\"evil\\". Seanna Cronin of the Sunshine Coast Daily wrote \\"After daring to rough up Ramsay Street icon Harold Bishop before fleeing town last year, it's doubtful Miller will be able to win over Erinsborough's residents this time around.\\" Laura Morgan from All About Soap wrote that Troy is \\"nasty\\", \\"crazy\\", \\"manipulative\\" and \\"unhinged\\". She observed that if his first stint in the soap was anything to go by, then his return would create much drama. Morgan added \\"And if you ask us, Troy's still in love with Sonya, so we wouldn't put it past him to have some trick up his sleeve to split her and Toadie up for good. He'd better not, or he'll have us to answer to!\\" Morgan's colleague Claire Crick later stated \\"Neighbours' Troy Miller has all the elements a proper soap baddie needs, but today he stooped to a new low when he revealed that not only did he once turn heavy-handed with Jade, but worse still – he seems almost proud of it!\\" Dianne Butler, writing for News.com.au, said \\"It's hard to completely dislike Troy despite the plague he's delivered on Ramsay St - not when he almost knocks Paul Robinson off his stool just for trying to get all alpha male on him.\\" Butler agreed with Jade when she told Troy that he was not going to be hanging around much longer, saying \\"Neighbours can't have Dieter Brummer in it, under-emoting while those hysterical teens scream at him. He's too talented.\\" ==References *Character profile at the Internet Movie Database Category:Neighbours characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2011 Category:Fictional military captains Category:Fictional Australian Army personnel Category:Male characters in television Category:Male villains ","title":"Troy Miller (Neighbours)"},{"id":"35885859","text":"Absa Bank Zambia Plc, formerly Barclays Bank of Zambia, is a commercial bank in Zambia.

Her indie movie From Hollywood to Hanoi was the first American documentary feature film shot in Vietnam by a Vietnamese- American. Tiana's life's work, Why Viet Nam? is about her personal story as a child of war and a widow of peace. Alexandra made her feature film debut in Sam Peckinpah's The Killer Elite, co-written by her husband Stirling Silliphant. Currently, Alexandra is director of Hampton-Silliphant Productions with Sir Christopher Hampton. ==Early life== Alexandra was born in Saigon, Vietnam in 1956. Her father Dư Phước Long, was a South Vietnamese politician, serving as Director of Press in Saigon and Cultural Attaché in Washington DC for the US allied administration of President Ngô Đình Diệm. Alexandra's father moved the family to Fairfax, Virginia, in 1966 after the assassination of President Diệm. He worked at the South Vietnamese Embassy in Washington, DC, and pursued studies at Georgetown University's Diplomatic School and Johns Hopkins University's Graduate School of Advanced International Studies. He became Patrick Du Long and became a scriptwriter and newscaster for the Voice of America. He authored a book, The Dream Shattered: Vietnamese Gangs in America. In 1998, he was a candidate for the California State Assembly. As a child of war refugee, the pre-teen attended Thomas Jefferson Jr. High School in Arlington Virginia during the worst years of desegregation. After being beat up in the girl's room for being Vietnamese, Tiana sought out Bruce Lee as her Jeet Kune Do Self Defense master. Bruce, who was not yet the international movie star, honed her interest in both the performing arts and martial arts. GrandMaster Jhoon Rhee crowned her TianaKaratePrincess and introduced her to his best friend Bruce Lee, at his National Tournament in Washington, DC. Bruce Lee introduced Alexandra to his best friend Stirling Silliphant who was \\"Hollywood highest paid screenwriter\\". Silliphant had written Lee into numerous TV shows, including Longstreet, an original two hour TV pilot called The Way of the Intercepting Fist. He believed in Bruce so much that he wrote the young Bruce into his script of Raymond Chandler's Marlowe. Silliphant had also written most of the episodes for the acclaimed television series Route 66, and won an Oscar for Best Screenplay on the feature film In the Heat of the Night. Alexandra and Stirling Silliphant were married in a ceremony at Chasen's Restaurant in West Hollywood on July 4, 1974. As reported by CBS News, the celebrity event included Robert Wagner, Natalie Wood, William Holden and Henry Mancini. ==CareerHollywood career=== Silliphant's blockbuster films The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno, coupled with his newlywed status with Alexandra, led to their joint appearances on television talk and game shows such as The Mike Douglas Show, The Reed Ferrell Show and Tattletales during the mid-1970s. Alexandra made her film debut in Sam Peckinpah's martial-arts thriller The Killer Elite with Robert Duvall and James Caan. She was the first Vietnamese-American to join the Screen Actors Guild. In 1978, Alexandra starred with Angie Dickenson, Robert Wagner and Dennis Weaver as Holly Nagata in the ABC mini-series Pearl, which dramatized the events surrounding the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. In 1981, Alexandra starred with Bruce Boxleitner and Brian Dennehy as Mai, a Vietnamese medic in the Warner Bros. made-for-television feature film Fly Away Home. The film critically examined the entanglement of politics and human suffering on the ground during the Vietnam War. As an Asian actress breaking through racial stereotypes, Alexandra was invited to speak out on the realities of Hollywood typecasting at venues such as the Philippine Film Festival, where she appeared with Robert Duvall in the Symposium on Film Acting. Alexandra starred as reporter Jan Du Long in an Aaron Spelling produced made-for-TV movie The Three Kings (1987). That same year she starred opposite Rod Steiger as Checkers Goldberg in the Kung Fu feature sendup, Catch The Heat. With her martial arts finesse at top form in 1986, Alexandra produced a fitness program called Karatecize, combining elements of dance, combat art and original pop music. Martial arts champion Eric Lee collaborated with Alexandra on the self-defense segments of the show. ===Music career=== Between 1983 and 1985, Alexandra was managed by Bill Wyman of The Rolling Stones and created numerous pop songs and music videos for radio and MTV. Her \\"Dumped On\\", \\"Lust In The Jungle\\", and \\"Free As I Want To Be\\" music videos were shot on location in New Zealand, Hong Kong, Yugoslavia and Los Angeles. Alexandra's music video of Bruce Lee, \\"Feel The Heat\\", was revamped in congruence with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 40th Anniversary Celebration of Bruce Lee's breakout film, Enter the Dragon. ===From Hollywood to Hanoi=== In 1988, Alexandra began pre- production on her first film, From Hollywood to Hanoi. Stemming from a trip taken earlier that year with a delegation of Vietnam veterans and filmmakers (in part on the advice of Alexandra's acting teacher Sandra Seacat, who predicted that a return to Alexandra's roots would prove enormously empowering), the feature-length documentary was written, produced and directed by Alexandra, and executive produced by Oliver Stone—who had himself taken part in Alexandra's delegation to Hanoi, and strongly urged her to record the experience on film.Solomon, Linda Ilene (June 8, 1993). \\"A Vietnam Movie Through a Different Lens\\". International Herald Tribune. June 8, 1993. p. 8. From Hollywood to Hanoi was the first American film shot on location in Viet Nam. It was shown at top film festivals and movie theaters across the U.S. and highlighted the plight of Amerasians, as well as the devastating effects of Agent Orange. It received acclaimed by New York Times and LA Times, Wall Street Journal, Variety, Hollywood Report, Boston Globe, Playboy, Washington Post and Time Magazine. Notable personalities including Allen Ginsberg, Oliver Stone, Michael Moore, and Studs Turkel became Alexandra's fans. But distribution was non-existent at the time for award-winning documentaries so the film's volunteer team led by the poet Steven Kauffman distributed the film in theaters and with Alexandra touring across America's college campuses. Alexandra is focusing on her Viet Nam Trilogy after her husband Stirling launched her on a mission of a lifetime to return to her roots in Viet Nam and make films for healing and reconciliation. Together with Oliver Stone they formed IndoChina Film Arts Foundation, a nonprofit organization also known as Film Arts Foundation International. With over 30 years of filming in Viet Nam, Alexandra owns the world's most extensive library of footage shot in post-war Viet Nam over the last 3 decades. Post production will resume in Europe and Viet Nam to premiere April 30th 2025, the 50th anniversary of the Fall of Saigon/ Liberation of Vietnam. Alexandra collaborates with distinguished writers and playwrights including Oscar winner Christopher Hampton and legendary composer, Philip Glass. From Hollywood To Hanoi went into theatrical release in 1995, and was broadcast as part of the HBO Cinemax Vanguard Cinema series. It was well received by critics: Kevin Thomas of the LA Times lauded it as \\"moving and engrossing\\", and Vincent Canby of The New York Times hailed it as \\"an intense, personal, supremely self-confident feature.\\" The film was named \\"Best of the Fest\\" at Telluride Film Festival, and was nominated for \\"Best Non-Fiction Film\\" at Sundance International Festival, where it was presented by Michael Moore. The film was also screened on Capitol Hill to help lift the trade embargo by then Senator John Kerry. Alexandra was invited to participate in the International Women's Day with Betty Friedan, Stevie Wonder and Barbara Trent. Tiana made feature guest appearances to talk about her film on The Today Show with Bryant Gumbel, The PBS News Hour with Charlayne Hunter Gault, and The KTLA Morning News with Regis Philbin. ===Filming Vietnamese leaders=== During three years of filming in Vietnam, Alexandra interviewed several former enemies of the U.S., who occupied high seats of power. They included Phạm Văn Đồng, and Lê Đức Thọ, a politician and diplomat who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize along with United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in 1973. Lê Đức Thọ declined the award. Alexandra also conducted interviews with General Võ Nguyên Giáp, the man Ho Chi Minh appointed to lead the North Vietnamese Army, which was victorious over the French and the Americans in the Indochina and Vietnam Wars. She was the first Westerner to interview Giáp after the Vietnam War, and returned to interview him several times, along with his wife, Co Ha, and their children over the next 25 years. ===Indochina Film Arts Foundation=== The aftermath of the war and trade embargoes left Vietnam the fifth poorest country in the world. Despite travel restrictions and her father's admonitions not to go, Alexandra returned to Vietnam with film crews to shoot From Hollywood to Hanoi, and a series of follow up films. Alexandra co-founded the Indochina Film Arts Foundation with Oliver Stone in 1993 to organize cooperative projects in the fine arts, theater, film, educational workshops, lectures and radio broadcast. Projects were presented at the Viet Nam Cinema Dept. & Filmmakers Association in Hanoi, the Asian American Film Festivals in New York City and Los Angeles, the Cinéma Festival du Réel at the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Directors Guild of America in Hollywood, and the Washington Project for the Arts in Washington DC. Alexandra has been a featured radio guest on NPR's Fresh Air Program with Terry Gross, as well as the Pacifica Network stations WBAI FM in New York, KFAI FM in Minneapolis and KPFK FM in Los Angeles. Alexandra has lectured at Bennington College, Bryn Mawr College, Harvard University, Columbia University, Notre Dame University, University of Southern California, Berkeley, University of California, Santa Barbara and Stanford University. She was a panelist in the \\"My Lai 25 Years After\\" conference at Tulane University. Alexandra was also appointed Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Film Studies at Dartmouth College in 1993. Since 1998, the Indochina Film Arts Foundation has conducted ongoing production workshops to advance the skills of aspiring Vietnamese filmmakers. Operations are based at Riva Studios in Ho Chi Minh City, and Hanoi Cinematique. In 2013, Indochina Film Arts Foundation began doing business as Film Arts Foundation. ===Ongoing documentary, education, and feature film=== In 2000, Alexandra explored the Plain of Jars region of Laos to document the effects of carpet-bombing and unexploded ordnance on local populations. Her Bomb Art Project collected scraps of ordnance for artists to fashion into sculpture. The Bomb Art Project and Bombs Away mini-documentary were publicly presented at the Bergamot Station Art Center in Los Angeles. Alexandra also documented the 30th Anniversary Reunion of Associated Press War Photographers in Ho Chi Minh City in 2005. Her documentary, Requiem, featured Pulitzer Prize–winning journalists and photojournalists Peter Arnett, and Nick Ut, as well as the local Vietnamese youth culture that had moved on from the war. In 2007, Alexandra went on world tour with Oscar and Tony winning author Christopher Hampton to help manage and promote his work on the feature film Atonement. Hampton was subsequently nominated for an Oscar for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay) on the film. A Tony Award Celebration was organized by Alexandra in 2009 in conjunction with the successful run of Yazmina Reza's Broadway play God of Carnage. The event celebrated the play's seven Tony nominations and three wins, and honored author Christopher Hampton's 50 plays and screenplays. James Gandolfini, Marcia Gay Harden, Philip Glass and Phillip Noyce participated in the short documentary that Alexandra created from the event. In 2009 Alexandra filmed an odyssey to find the spirit of Michael Jackson in Beverly Hills and Viet Nam, with Le Ly Hayslip - the author and subject of Oliver Stone's feature film Heaven and Earth. Le Ly and Tiana visited the site of Jackson's death and documented the throngs of impersonators carrying on his legacy in both the U.S. and Vietnam. As co-owner of Christopher Hampton's stage play The Talking Cure, Alexandra was instrumental in developing the project into a feature film directed by David Cronenberg. The film, retitled A Dangerous Method, starred Michael Fassbender as Swiss psychotherapist Carl Jung, and Keira Knightley as his patient and mistress. Alexandra is credited as Associate Producer on the 2011 release. In 2012, Alexandra and Christopher Hampton formed Hampton Silliphant Management & Productions, which presented the play Appomattox at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The play concerns itself with historic events in America, 100 years apart in time: the historic meeting between Generals Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee in 1865, and the 1965 shooting of a Baptist church deacon during a peaceful civil rights protest in Alabama. Alexandra's film The General & Me focuses on her 25-year relationship with General Võ Nguyên Giáp, Ho Chi Minh's trusted military strategist during the Indochina and Vietnam Wars. ==Filmography== ;As actress *1975: The Killer Elite (alternative title: The agents elite) - Tommie *1978: Pearl (alternative title: Pearl Harbor) (TV Mini-Series) - Holly Nagata *1981: Fly Away Home (TV Movie) - Mai *1987: Catch the Heat (video title in the Federal Republic of Germany: Fire Game) - Checkers Goldberg *1987: The Three Kings (TV Movie) - Jan DuLong (final film role) ;As director *1992: From Hollywood to Hanoi *2017: The General and Me ;As producer *1992: From Hollywood to Hanoi *2011: A Dangerous Method ;Other performances (e.g. herself) *1986: Karatix *1992: From Hollywood to Hanoi ==Nominations== * 1993: Nominated for the \\"Grand Jury Prize\\" in the Category: Documentary ( Documentary) the Sundance Film Festival for the film From Hollywood to Hanoi ==References * Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Vietnamese emigrants to the United States Category:American film actresses ","title":"Tiana Alexandra"},{"id":"35885906","text":"Ivan Rein (9 September 1905 - 12 December 1943) was a Croatian Jewish painter. ==Early life and education== Rein was born in Osijek into a Jewish family. His father Mavro Rein was Osijek's prominent judge and a lawyer, his mother Olga (née Hönigsberg) came from a Zagreb's wealthy Jewish family, who owned a leather factory and the famous Caffé Zagreb. Rein had a sister, Renata. From his early age Rein learned languages, literature, philosophy, art and music. Rein attended the private school of Josip Leović, where he learned painting. He went to Osijek gymnasium, and was sitting together with Oscar Nemon,the known Croatian sculptor. In 1924 Rein went to Vienna where he enrolled to study architecture. With the support of his parents, Rein abandoned his studies in Vienna, and in 1925 returned to his family, which in the meantime moved to Zagreb. In Zagreb he started to attend the study of painting at the Academy of Fine Arts Zagreb in the class of the famous Croatian painter Vladimir Becić. Ha-Kol (Glasilo Židovske zajednice u Hrvatskoj); Ivan Rein, Pariška paleta; stranica 62; broj 98, studeni / prosinac 2006. ==Career and later life== Upon the completion of his study at the academy, in 1929, Rein moved to Paris and settled in the Latin Quarter. With having excellent knowledge of foreign languages, particularly French, Rein quickly turned to an artistic life. In 1933 he had his first solo exhibition in Paris and in 1934 he participated at the first annual exhibition of Croatian artists in Zagreb. The Spanish Civil War deeply shocked Rein, as he joined the international anti-war movement that opposed the emerging Fascism. The suffering of innocent people and death become almost obsessive theme for Rein, as they are illustrated in his works. In 1937 Rein attended the exhibition of Yugoslav artists in Paris, where he exhibited nine works. He participated in 1939 at the exhibition of Yugoslav painters and sculptors hosted at the Bernheim-Jeune gallery in Paris. After the Nazi occupation of France, in 1940 Rein returned to Zagreb where he participated in the exhibitions until the Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia in 1941. Due to the frequent persecution of Croatian Jews, Rein escaped to Gorski Kotar, but in 1942 he ended up in the concentration camp Kraljevica. In the camp, Rein taught children and his friends to draw and paint. In 1943 the Italians closed the camp in Kraljevica and moved all prisoners to the Rab concentration camp. After the capitulation of Italy and the liberation of the camp, Rein joined the Partisans. At the end of 1943, Rein was seriously wounded and caught by Ustaše. After torture and unsuccessful surgery, he died in the Sisak hospital on 12 December 1943. That same year his parents were killed at the Jasenovac and Stara Gradiška concentration camps. His sister was the only member of the family who survived the Holocaust, and after the war she moved to Canada where she lived until her death. ==Legacy== After the war Reins 900 works, of nearly 2000 that he created while in Paris, were saved and delivered to Croatia. In the early 1980, after reanimation, research, through the exhibitions and monographs devoted to Rein, his saved works were presented to wider audience. Exhibitions of Reins works are often presented across Croatia in the various Museums and galleries. ==References== Category:1905 births Category:1943 deaths Category:People from Osijek Category:Croatian Jews Category:Austro-Hungarian Jews Category:Croatian Austro-Hungarians Category:Jewish painters Category:Jews in the Yugoslav Partisans Category:Yugoslav Partisans members Category:Croatian people of World War II Category:Yugoslav military personnel killed in World War II Category:Academy of Fine Arts, University of Zagreb alumni Category:Rab concentration camp survivors Category:20th-century Croatian painters ","title":"Ivan Rein"},{"id":"35885929","text":"Jubilee Bunt-a-thon is a 2012 animated short film directed by Nick Park, which stars his characters Wallace and Gromit.

After a short break from professional action in 1994, the club rejoined the 2nd Division, but it almost fell through when the top division club, Puebla FC, decided not to lend them their stadium; until just before the tournament began, when the Puebla FC and Águilas finally agreed on a deal. That same year the club just avoided relegation after they managed to defeat Queretaroa, and so finishing with 24 points, one more than Yautepec, who was relegated to the 3rd division. In 1995 the club was forced to move their home games to the Estadio Trinidad in Tlaxcala after failing to pay its 20% of the stadium maintenance.

In operation, decay heat boils steam, which is drawn into the heat exchanger and condensed; then it falls by weight of gravity back into the reactor. This process keeps the cooling water in the reactor, making it unnecessary to use powered feedwater pumps. The water in the open pool slowly boils off, venting clean steam to the atmosphere. This makes it unnecessary to run mechanical systems to remove heat. Periodically, the pool must be refilled, a simple task for a fire truck. The (E)SBWR reactors provide three days' supply of water in the pool. Some older reactors also have IC systems, including Fukushima Dai-ichi reactor 1, however their water pools may not be as large. Under normal conditions, the IC system is not activated, but the top of the IC condenser is connected to the reactor's steam lines through an open valve. Steam enters the IC condenser and condenses until it is filled with water. When the IC system is activated, a valve at the bottom of the IC condenser is opened which connects to a lower area on the reactor. The water falls to the reactor via gravity, allowing the condenser to fill with steam, which then condenses. This cycle runs continuously until the bottom valve is closed. == Problems== In case of electricity failure, the valves close automatically, and operators have to open them manually, which can be difficult in case of accident has already released radioactive steam inside the building. During the accident Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011, the operators did not open the valve manually, and emergency system had been activated too late and could not work for long. Operators did not know if they should've left the valves open or not when the tanks of two condensers were emptied of their water cooling.Arte TV (2013) : « Fukushima, chronique d'un désastre » 2013-03-07 == References  External links == * Patent Patent for Isolation Condensor ==Bibliography == * AEC, Severe Accident Analyses of Fukushima-Daiichi Units 1 Category:Light water reactors Category:Energy conversion Category:Nuclear power Category:Nuclear technology Category:Nuclear power stations Category:Power station technology Category:Nuclear safety and security Category:Nuclear power plant components ","title":"Isolation condensor"},{"id":"35886077","text":"Drive is a song by American actor and singer Cheyenne Jackson from his album I'm Blue, Skies.

Suhler has been playing professionally since the 1980s and has performed with a variety of Blues legends that include George Thorogood, Johnny Winter, AC/DC, Buddy Whittington, Billy F. Gibbons, Joe Bonamassa, Elvin Bishop, and Buddy Guy along with many other notable musicians. He resides in Dallas, Texas and plays locally in and around Texas' major cities, especially Dallas/Fort Worth with his own band, \\"Jim Suhler & Monkey Beat\\", in addition to the remainder of the United States and also Canada. He and his band have also gained a large following in Europe, particularly in the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, England and Ireland. The current Monkey Beat lineup includes: Shawn Phares on keyboards/accordion (joined in 2000); Patrick Smith on bass (joined in 2019); and Beau Chadwell on drums/percussion (joined in 2011). Former members include Jimmy Morgan & Paul Hollis (both on drums) and also Carlton Powell on bass guitar/vocals (co- founding member), as well as Christopher Alexander on bass guitar. Since 1999, Suhler has been the rhythm/lead guitarist for George Thorogood & The Destroyers on all the band's releases & tours. Suhler performing with George Thorogood at Crossroads, Kansas City on August 20, 2010 == Early life and career influences== Jim Suhler was born in Dallas, Texas on December 30, 1960. He grew up in the Lakewood area of Dallas, Texas and attended Hillcrest High School. His first exposure to music was by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and other British Invasion bands on Dallas AM top 40 radio station KLIF in the 1960s. His major influences at that point were Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Allman Brothers Band, ZZ Top, Johnny Winter, Led Zeppelin and Rory Gallagher among others. During these formative years, Suhler was exposed to Texas guitar talent performing in local North Texas nightclubs like Bugs Henderson, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Anson Funderburgh, Jimmie Vaughan and Rocky Hill. Suhler played in an array of forgotten cover and original bands during these years, initially backing other vocalists or guitarists. He knew at an early age he definitely wanted to be a musician (he started playing guitar at the age of 14) but it wasn't until a trip to Mississippi where he met the legendary artist, Son Thomas, that he knew for certain that he wanted to play the blues. Suhler said of this visit, \\"He was really gracious – he let me come in and we played together. It was really special.\\" Suhler never had the privilege of sharing the stage with Stevie Ray Vaughan, but he did get the opportunity to meet the blues legend on a couple of occasions, initially in 1989 at his father's jewelry store in Dallas when Vaughan stopped in to have a watch repaired. When Suhler's father asked Stevie if he had any advice for his musician son, his reply was \\"Yeah, keep it clean\\" – meaning stay clear of drugs, advice which Suhler took to heart. When Vaughan didn't return to pick up the watch, Suhler decided to try to return it to him – \\"Vaughan was playing in Dallas at Fair Park, I take his watch to him, get backstage and he's very amused that I'm even there bringing him his watch—he was very polite, a very sweet, soft-spoken man. And I'm not big on vibes and auras and stuff like that but I swear on everything that's holy to me that when Stevie walked up to me he radiated a light, he had an aura about him. And I don't even like to say things like that because people say 'Yeah, sure' – but he was a big inspiration to me\\". Suhler's first bar band was called \\"Stray Kats\\". They played a few gigs in 1980 at St. Christopher's, one of Stevie Ray Vaughan's Dallas venues at that time. Suhler played guitar for the hard rock band \\"Overlord\\" in 1985, playing Dallas' punk/underground venues including the Twilite Room, Theater Gallery and also Nairobi Room. Suhler then co-fronted the Road Hogs from 1986–1988, with harmonica player/vocalist Memo Gonzalez, recording a long lost 45rpm for Pee Wee Records, \\"Dogged & Driven b/w \\"Hot & Bothered\\". Suhler was playing a much more traditional form of blues than he is now known for, much in the style of T-Bone Walker, Magic Sam and B.B. King. Following the demise of the Road Hogs, Suhler's next band was The Homewreckers. This lineup played together from 1989–1991, recording a cassette only release called \\"Hit It & Git It\\". It was during this period Suhler was a DJ at Dallas' KNON radio station, hosting a three-hour weekly blues show called \\"Radio Mojo\\" every Tuesday night (1987–1990). ==Monkey Beat / George Thorogood and The Destroyers== Monkey Beat performing at Knuckleheads Saloon in Kansas City, Missouri on July 11, 2010 While later playing a Homewreckers set at a Memphis, Tennessee club called Huey's, he was discovered by George Thorogood, eventually joining the Destroyers in 1999. Thorogood was impressed with Suhler's playing, arranging and songwriting skills, and consequently the two struck up a friendship. After the Homewreckers imploded in mid-1991, Suhler formed power trio Monkey Beat, with drummer Paul Hollis and bassist/vocalist Carlton Powell. At that time, Suhler sent a four song demo to Thorogood's producer/engineer Terry Manning, after Thorogood told Suhler, \\"Terry Would Love You Guys\\". Manning was impressed with Monkey Beat, agreeing to engineer and release an album on Manning's fledgling label, Lucky Seven records. The albums \\"Radio Mojo\\" (1992) and \\"Shake\\" (1995) were the result of this initial collaboration. Several tours opening for Thorogood & the Destroyers across North America in 1993–95 followed. Thorogood also had Suhler appear with him on numerous radio shows and make in-store appearances with him to get Monkey Beat more exposure. Suhler became a full-time member of George Thorogood & The Destroyer's in 1999 and has appeared on every release by the band since then, playing rhythm/lead guitar, as well as co-writing some of the band's material. After the recording of the Mike Morgan/Jim Suhler CD \\"Let The Dogs Run\\", Monkey Beat went to the legendary Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas to again record with Manning. \\"Shake\\" soon followed, which to this day is Suhler's darkest, most hard rock record. The lyrics were fueled by a divorce that Suhler was going through at the time of the writing and conception of the music. For the next few years, Jim Suhler & Monkey Beat toured throughout the United States and Europe, playing clubs, theaters and festivals for an ever burgeoning fan base. “Bad JuJu\\", which was produced by noted producer Jim Gaines (Stevie Ray Vaughan, Carlos Santana) was easily the most fully realized Monkey Beat album to date, & released by Lucky Seven records in 2001. Texas rock 'n roll, Zydeco, Tex-Mex music, Hip Hop & Blues influences were all evident on the songs on this album. “Tijuana Bible\\" was released in 2009. It was recorded in Nashville with Tom Hambridge producing, & includes guest artists Elvin Bishop, Jimmy Hall and Joe Bonamassa. \\"Tijuana Bible\\" included covers by Rory Gallagher, AC/DC, and Elvin Bishop, as well as 13 of Suhler's originals. The album was nominated for the Blues Music Award in the category of best blues-rock recording. \\"Panther Burn\\" was released on February 18, 2014 on Underworld Records. Contributors to this album include Kim Wilson of The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Asleep at the Wheel's Ray Benson, Carolyn Wonderland and Jason Elmore. The album was nominated by \\"Blues Blast\\" magazine for Best Blues Rock Album for 2014. The group's latest effort, \\"Live At The Kessler\\" (produced by Suhler), featuring 16 tracks (including 2 new songs) was recorded at the historic theater in Dallas on November 28, 2015, and released on June 16, 2016, also on Underworld Records. ==Later career== Suhler onstage performing with George Thorogood & The Destroyers – Opening for AC/DC in Helsinki, Finland 2002 Also on Suhler's resume is scoring the PBS documentary \\"Larry vs. Lockney\\", and having his compositions used in major motion picture releases and television worldwide. In 2002, Suhler fulfilled a lifelong dream by playing two shows with AC/DC during their Stiff Upper Lip Tour, in Helsinki, Finland and Hamburg, Germany. Suhler has also played publicly onstage with Les Paul, James Cotton, Hank Williams, Jr., Duke Robillard, Peter Wolf, Willie Nelson, Irma Thomas, Dr. John, Pinetop Perkins, Lazy Lester, Steve Miller, Elvin Bishop, Son Seals, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, Johnny Rivers, Joe Bonamassa, Cross Canadian Ragweed and others. Suhler also appears on the 2008 Elvin Bishop album, \\"The Blues Rolls On\\". Suhler co- produced an album in 2010 for another Texas-Based Blues Band, \\"Jason Elmore & Hoodoo Witch\\" (Jason Elmore: Lead Guitar/Vocals, Brandon Katona: Bass, Mike Talbot: Drums) entitled \\"Upside Your Head\\" which received widespread acclaim in the Blues genre.

The full name of the community is The Community of the Mission Sisters of the Holy Name of Jesus, usually shortened to Community of the Holy Name. The order currently operates in Europe and Africa. There is also an order operating in Australia with the same name which has an independent history, having been founded entirely separately.See editorial note, base of page 37, in Anglican Religious Life 2012-13, Canterbury Press, Norwich, . == Structure== As of 2013, the community numbered 89 sisters who live in convents and branch houses. These are grouped into geographical provinces, of which there are currently three, the English province, and the Lesotho and Zululand provinces in Southern Africa. Each has an elected provincial superior and an assistant superior who is appointed by the provincial superior. There is no superior general of the order and authority to direct the order arises out of regular meetings of the chapter of each province in accordance with the constitution of the province. The chapter consists of all life-professed sisters. While all three provinces follow the same rule of life, there are local variations of practice in accordance with local tradition and culture. Each province has a bishop visitor. ==History== The Convent Of The Holy Name, Ranelagh Road, Malvern Link The community was founded in 1865 by Father George William Herbert (3 October 1830 – 14 November 1894), parish priest of St Peter's Church, Vauxhall, London. Mother Frances Mary was not the first mother superior, but she and Father Herbert drew the fledgling group of sisters together into a vibrant community. The community was originally called St Peter's Sisterhood and worked alongside the parish priest and his assistants in helping the deprived and poor of the parish. By 1876 the community had taken as its dedication \\"The Holy Name of Jesus\\", thus reflecting a vocation of reaching out to others in the name of \\"Jesus, Saviour\\". The founders drew inspiration from both the Catholic and Evangelical movements. In 1887 the mother house (the Convent of the Holy Name) was established at Malvern Link, Worcestershire, while mission houses remained in London and elsewhere in the UK. The chapel (1891-3) at Malvern by Sir Ninian Comper and William Bucknall is now a Grade II* listed building. In 1962 CHN opened a community house in Lesotho in southern Africa amalgamating with the Community of St Mary at the Cross. In 1969 CHN opened a community house in Zululand, South Africa. The community in England moved to the present convent in Oakwood, Derby in 1990, where the sisters work with local parishes. ==Provinces and conventsEnglish province=== Community branch houses continue to be integral to the Community's way of life as the Sisters seek to actively and prayerfully respond to today’s needs, living among the poor and deprived and being a praying presence in the midst of need. CHN branch houses are * Derby (Oakwood) * Manchester (Longsight) * Peterborough (Welland estate) * There are four sisters who live as Solitaries. The mother house of the UK province is in Derby. The resident sisters work from the convent in local parishes engaging with local needs and issues. Hospitality plays a large part in the life of the convent; there is a guest cottage for residential guests and accommodation is available for day guests or groups needing space to meet. Many sisters are active in social issues, campaigns for justice and peace and are involved in the Anglican Communion. Two of the sisters are ordained priests and are involved in parish ministry. CHN has one sister who represents the Anglican religious in the General Synod of the Church of England. ===Lesotho province=== In 1959, Bishop John Maund, Bishop of Basutoland, invited CHN to establish a branch house in Basutoland, amalgamating with the Community of St Mary at the Cross, a small African community that had been founded by the Community of St Michael and All Angels who had worked in Leribe for many years but were now withdrawing. CHN agreed but with the condition that the African sisters and the English sisters would no longer be segregated as they had been with the St Michael sisters. The African sisters agreed to this and after some training in England by four of the African sisters, the four African sisters and five English sisters arrived at the house in Leribe. The intention to live as one community was a powerful statement in the face of the Apartheid regime that was coming into force just across the border in South Africa. The sisters today work extensively with both school children and victims of AIDS. The convents of this province are: * Ficksburg (South Africa) * Leribe (Lesotho) ===Zulu province=== Founded by sisters from England and Lesotho in 1969, Zulu is the newest province of the order. The provincial mother house is in Melmoth. The sisters work in local parishes, and also in hospitals and schools. The convents of this province are: * Luyengo, Swaziland * Melmoth (provincial mother house) * Nongoma * Rosettenville (St Benedict's House) ==References *CHN website *Information from the Anglican Communion office Category:Anglican orders and communities Category:Christian religious orders established in the 19th century Category:Anglican organizations established in the 19th century ","title":"Community of the Holy Name"},{"id":"35886462","text":"Mike or Michael Powers may refer to: * Mike Powers (baseball) (1906–1983), American right fielder in Major League Baseball * Mike Powers (soccer) (born 1957), retired American soccer midfielder * Mike Powers (Wisconsin politician) (born 1962), American politician * Doc Powers (Michael Riley Powers, 1870–1909), American Major League Baseball player * Michael R.

He was convicted by an Israeli military court in 2012 (after being arrested in 2011) for \\"sending people to throw stones, and holding a march without a permit\\". In his West Bank village Nabi Salih, Tamimi organizes weekly demonstrations against Israeli settlement. He has been arrested by the Israeli authorities over a dozen times, at one point spending more than three years in administrative detention without trial. Tamimi has said that he advocates grassroots, nonviolent resistance, but has also said that stone-throwing is an important symbol of Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation.Palestinian activist aims to ‘start an intifada against Israel in the US’, Times of Israel, 6 October 2015 His 2011 arrest drew international attention, with the European Union describing him as a human rights defender, and Amnesty International designating him a prisoner of conscience. He was arrested again in October 2012 for a demonstration in a supermarket, but released in early 2013. He is the father of Ahed Tamimi, who was sentenced to eight months in prison under a plea bargain in 2018.Ahed Tamimi sentenced to 8 months in prison in plea deal, YNET, 21 March 2018 ==Background== Tamimi was ten weeks old at the time of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank in June 1967 and hid with his mother in a cave during the conflict. As a grassroots activist, he organized weekly demonstrations to protest the seizure of the village's well by the nearby Israeli settlement of Halamish, established in 1977. The protests regularly lead to violent clashes, with Palestinian youths throwing stones and Israeli forces firing on protesters with tear gas, rubber bullets, and water cannons. Since the end of 2009, 64 people (13% of the village's population) has been arrested. Prior to his 2011 arrest, Tamimi had been arrested by Israeli authorities eleven times, at one point spending more than three years in administrative detention without trial. In 1993, he lost consciousness for eight days after being shaken during an interrogation, and required surgery for removal of a subdural haematoma. His home has also been designated for demolition by Israel's Civil Administration. Tamimi is an admirer of Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi and believes that armed conflict against a more powerful Israeli opponent will only bring disaster. Tamimi states that he advocates nonviolent resistance, telling a reporter in 2011, \\"Our strategic choice of a popular struggle—as a means to fight the occupation taking over our lands, lives and future—is a declaration that we do not harm human lives. The very essence of our activity opposes killing.\\" However, he has stated he is not concerned as to whether stone-throwing is a form of violence, but views it instead as a symbol of Palestinian resistance: \\"We see our stones as our message.\\" ==March 2011 arrest and trial== On 24 March 2011 Tamimi was detained by Israeli forces following a demonstration. Following his arrest, he was charged with sending youths to throw stones, holding a march without a permit, incitement, and perverting the course of justice. He was subsequently held in a military prison for thirteen months. Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience, \\"detained solely for his role in organizing peaceful protests against the encroachment onto Palestinian lands by Israeli settlers,\\" and called for his immediate and unconditional release. On 27 April 2012 Tamimi was released on 12,000 shekels (US$3,193) bail due to a stroke suffered by his mother two weeks previous. An army prosecutor protested against his release, stating that Tamimi would \\"most definitely continue to use the status he received because of his arrest to influence young people to throw stones.\\" Tamimi, during his trial, repeatedly questioned the legitimacy of the Israeli military court trying him as well as Israeli regulations regarding public gatherings. The military judge ultimately found him guilty of sending stone- throwers and illegal protesting but cleared him of the two more serious charges. She stated that testimony from a 14-year-old witness had been inconsistent and therefore unusable and that she had found misrepresentations by interrogators about the content of the confession of another witness. Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak described Tamimi's partial exoneration as a \\"miracle\\" given the 99.74 percent conviction rate of the military court. Before his sentencing Tamimi stated that \\"the laws come from an occupying regime whose legitimacy I do not recognise. I don't think even for a single minute that there is going to be justice done.\\" His lawyer denied Tamimi's involvement in stone throwing, stating that Tamimi believed in passive resistance. On 29 May, Tamimi was sentenced to time served of thirteen months' imprisonment, and an additional two suspended sentences. A military spokeswoman stated that the sentence had been suspended due to \\"irregularities in the trial\\" and Tamimi's \\"clean prison record\\". Under the terms of Tamimi's suspended sentences, he would be imprisoned for two months if he participated in an illegal demonstration within two years of the sentencing, and imprisoned for seven months if he participated in \\"activity against the security forces\\" within five years. Responding to the suspended sentences, Tamimi said, \\"I feel that my whole life is under the surveillance of the judge.\\" Catherine Ashton, the European Union High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, expressed the EU's concern over the conviction and called on Israel to allow peaceful protests. She also condemned the interrogation of a minor without a lawyer in the investigation as a \\"violation of his rights.\\" Human Rights Watch stated that the conviction \\"violates [Tamimi's] right to freedom of assembly, while [the court's] conviction of him on a second charge of urging children to throw stones on the basis of a child’s coercively- obtained statement raises serious concerns about the fairness of his trial.\\" == October 2012 arrest == On 24 October, Tamimi joined 80 other activists, both Palestinian and international, in a protest at a Rami Levy supermarket in the West Bank just north of Jerusalem. The activists carried banners reading \\"Boycott occupation and its products.\\" Tamimi was arrested during the protest, which the Israeli police called \\"an illegal demonstration.\\" Amnesty International again described him as a prisoner of conscience, stating \\"Once again, Bassem Tamimi is being held solely for peacefully exercising his rights to freedom of expression and assembly.\\" He was released in early 2013. On 2 November, his sixteen-year-old son Wa'ed Tamimi was also arrested during one of the weekly demonstrations in Nabi Salih. The charges against him were dismissed by a judge two weeks later. ==Activism 2013-present== In 2015, the Anti-Defamation League condemned a post (since deleted) by Tamimi on social media, where he allegedly spread the false myth of the Israel harvesting the organs of Palestinian children.Anti-Defamation League , Oct 16, 2015 In December, 2017, Tamimi's 16 year old daughter, Ahed Tamimi was seen in a viral video Haaretz Dec 20, 2017 pushing, punching and kicking Israeli soldiers, following their cousin being shot in the face with a rubber bullet and being put into an induced coma. The next day, she was arrested for the first time by the Israeli army, in a pre-dawn raid on their home in Nabi Salih. Later in the day, Ahad's mother Nariman was allegedly arrested too when visiting her daughter at a police station. In the wake of the incident, Israeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett declared that the young women involved \\"should finish their lives in prison\\". ==Personal life== Tamimi has a wife, Nariman, and four children. The Tamimis was a Christian family, who became Muslim before they came to Nabi Salih (from Hebron) 300-400 years ago. In 2012, a photograph of his daughter Ahed shaking her fist at an Israeli soldier became internationally famous, and she received the Handala Courage award in Istanbul meeting that Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In 1993, Tamimi's sister, Bassama Tamimi died while attending his remand hearing at the military court in Ramallah, allegedly after she was pushed down a flight of stairs by an Israeli army interpreter.Palestinian West Bank Protest Leader: 'Israel Killed the Two-state Solution' , Haaretz, Feb 17, 2013 Bassem's cousin Rushdi Muhammed Sa'id Tamimi was convicted of the October 1993 murder of Haim Mizrahi,Prominent West Bank Palestinian Is Murdered as Violence Escalates , Los Angeles Times, October 31, 1993 a settler from Beit El, he was released in 2013.List of Palestinian terrorists set to be freed by Israel , Jerusalem Post, Dec 29, 2013 Bassem was arrested and reportedly tortured.Israel's Interrogation of Palestinians from the Occupied Territories , Human Rights Watch, 1994 In December 2011, Tamimi's cousin Mustafa Tamimi was killed by a direct hit from a gas grenade fired at close range.Israeli Military Closes Probe Into Death of Palestinian Protester Mustafa Tamimi , Haaretz, Dec 5, 2013 In November 2012, Tamimi's brother-in-law Rushdi Tamimi was shot and killed by Israeli soldiers.IDF Probe: 80 Bullets Fired Without Justification in Death of West Bank Palestinian , Haaretz, Jan 13, 2013Palestinian dies after being shot during protest , Jerusalem Post, Nov 19, 2012 == References Further reading== * \\"محكمة إسرائيلية تقضي بسجن الناشط الفلسطيني باسم التميمي.\\" (Archive) BBC.

Puleston had come to Brookhaven after World War II as Director of Technical Information for Brookhaven National Laboratory. The two \\"birders\\" became friends, and soon began a tradition of taking Bellport students along on half-day bird-watching expeditions and nature walks on weekends.

In the ensuing years, the club also was instrumental in establishing container deposit legislation, first in Suffolk County and then in New York state, and in protecting harbor seals in New York state. == Expedition leader == In 1970, Cooley's friend, mentor, and fellow EDF trustee Dennis Puleston retired from Bookhaven Labs and was invited by the National Audubon Society to voyage to Antarctica on the MS Discoverer. The trip was organized by Lars-Eric Lindblad, a pioneer in adventure travel. Twenty years later, as Cooley ended his teaching career, Puleston convinced Lars-Erik's son, Sven Lindblad, to hire Cooley as a naturalist and expedition leader for Lindblad Expeditions.Transcript of Dennis Puleston Memorial Celebration, July 16, 2001 Cooley traveled with and led Lindblad expeditions during much of the following two decades. On ocean cruises to Alaska, Europe, South America, the South Pacific, and Antarctica, he helped passengers to appreciate the historical, cultural, biological, and environmental significance of the sites they visited and the sights they saw. As he wrote in one of his 'Daily Expedition Reports' while on the National Geographic Endeavour in the South Pacific:Expedition Report, August 8, 2006 > ... we did inquire into the nature of things and had an extraordinary day. > There is no better rationale for traveling than to seek answers. Even if > they are not easily forthcoming, there is much joy in the quest. == Environmentalist == In fall of 1965, Cooley helped bring together a small group of central Long Islanders concerned with local environmental issues such as farm runoff, sewage problems, waste dumps, groundwater contamination, and his own particular interest, saltwater marsh preservation. The group included Bellport High School students, Dennis Puleston, and some of his Brookhaven National Laboratory colleagues, faculty members from Stony Brook University, and other activists. They met somewhat informally in members' living rooms, and named themselves the Brookhaven Town Natural Resources Committee (BTNRC). Although there were no elected officers, Cooley often functioned as chairman at BTNRC get-togethers. As remembered by participant (and fellow EDF co- founder) Charles F. Wurster:\\"The Power of an Idea,\\" by Dr. Charles F. Wurster, in Rogers, Marion L. (1990) Acorn Days: The Environmental Defense Fund and How It Grew. New York: Environmental Defense Fund. Print. p 44-53. > He could not only run an excellent meeting, but also had the remarkable > ability to arouse people's enthusiasms about environmental topics. Someone > once remarked that he could get a group of people excited about a blade of > grass. Those qualities were among the secret weapons of BTNRC, and of EDF to > come. In the spring of 1966, Cooley was among the BTNRC activists who testified in favor of a class action lawsuit filed by Patchogue attorney Victor Yannacone against the Suffolk County Mosquito Control Commission, seeking to force the commission to stop using the insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in the local salt marshes.Environmental Defense Fund Archive Manuscript Collection 232. Record Group 1 - Founders' Papers. Sub-group II: Arthur P. Cooley Papers. Processed by Meredith Bouchard, 2003. Updated in August 2009. Others from BTNRC who provided expert testimony included Dennis Puleston, who presented the court with his own artistic renderings of the salt marsh food chain; Charles F. Wurster, a molecular biologist who had previously helped to stop the town of Hanover, New Hampshire, from using DDT to combat Dutch elm disease; George M. Woodwell, senior ecologist of the Brookhaven National Laboratory who had published on, among other things, the persistence of DDT in forest soils; Robert E. Smolker, professor of biological sciences at Stony Brook; and ecologist and ornithologist Antony S. Taormina, Regional Director of Fish and Game of the New York State Conservation Department. The group won a temporary injunction from the New York Supreme Court in August 1966 banning the county's use of DDT, and the Mosquito Commission switched to using the organophosphate Abate (temefos) instead. By the time the court eventually (in November 1967) ruled that it did not have jurisdiction in the case,CAROL A. YANNACONE v. H. LEE DENNISON ET AL. Supreme Court of New York, Special Term, Suffolk County; November 30, 1967. Jack Stanislaw, J. Suffolk County had abandoned DDT. Meanwhile, Yannacone and the BTNRC \\"trouble-makers\\" attempted in September 1967 to convince the National Audubon Society, at that year's Atlantic City convention, to establish a \\"legal defense fund\\" on behalf of the environment, and to begin a national assault on the use of DDT. The Audubon conventioneers delayed any action, so on October 6, 1967, the BTNRC activists—with a couple of new recruits from the convention—met in a conference room at Brookhaven Labs to sign the Certificate of Incorporation for the Environmental Defense Fund. The registration fee was paid by Connecticut conservationist Bob Burnap, and $10,000 was pledged by Dr. H. Lewis Batts, Jr., professor of biology at Kalamazoo College (still in town after the Audubon convention), for an EDF campaign against dieldrin back in his home state of Michigan. Yannacone left EDF to concentrate on his own law practice in 1969. But by 1971, EDF had become a coalition of 60 lawyers, 700 scientists, and 25,000 dues-paying members.\\"Sue the Bastards.\\" Time Vol. 98, Issue 16 (18 Oct 1971): 84. Accessed 2 May 2012, via Academic Search Premier In 1972, most uses of DDT were banned by the United States federal government. Also that year, Art Cooley succeeded Dennis Puleston as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of EDF. Cooley served as chairman until 1975. He has remained active in the organization, and in 2012 serves as the board's Secretary. == Personal life == Cooley is married to Beverly R.

It covers the history of what are now known as the indigenous peoples of Venezuela. Archeologists have discovered evidence of the earliest known inhabitants of the Venezuelan area in the form of leaf-shaped flake tools, together with chopping and plano-convex scraping implements exposed on the high riverine terraces of the Pedregal River in western Venezuela. Late Pleistocene hunting artifacts, including spear tips, come from a similar site in northwestern Venezuela known as El Jobo. According to radiocarbon dating, these date from 13,000 to 7000 BC. Kipfer 2000, p. 172. Taima-Taima, yellow Muaco and El Jobo in Falcón are some of the sites that have yielded archeological material from these times.Silverman, Helaine; Isbell, William (Eds.) (2008): Handbook of South American Archaeology 1st ed. 2008. Corr. 2nd printing, XXVI, 1192 p. 430 .. Pg 433-434 These groups co-existed with megafauna like megatherium, glyptodonts and toxodonts. Archaeologists identify a Meso-Indian period from 7000-5000 B.C.to 1000 A.C. In this period, hunters and gatherers of megafauna started to turn to other food sources and established the first tribal structures. Beginning around 1000 A.C. archaeologists speak of the Neo-Indian period, which ends with the European Conquest and Colony period. A palafito like the ones seen by Amerigo VespucciIt is not known how many people lived in Venezuela before the Spanish Conquest; it may have been around a million people, and in addition to today's peoples included groups such as the Arawaks, Caribs, and Timoto-cuicas. The number was much reduced after the Conquest, mainly through the spread of new diseases from Europe.Wunder, Sven (2003), Oil wealth and the fate of the forest: a comparative study of eight tropical countries, Routledge. p130. There were two main north-south axes of pre-Columbian population, producing maize in the west and manioc in the east. Large parts of the Llanos plains were cultivated through a combination of slash and burn and permanent settled agriculture. The indigenous peoples of Venezuela had already encountered crude oils and asphalts that seeped up through the ground to the surface. Known to the locals as mene, the thick, black liquid was primarily used for medicinal purposes, as an illumination source, and for the caulking of canoes. In the 16th century when Spanish colonization began in Venezuelan territory, the population of several indigenous peoples such as the Mariches (descendants of the Caribes) declined. Native caciques (leaders) such as Guaicaipuro (c. 1530–1568) and Tamanaco (died 1573) attempted to resist Spanish incursions, but the newcomers ultimately subdued them. The founder of Caracas, Diego de Losada, ultimately put Tamanaco to death. == References == Category:Archaeology of Venezuela Venezuela ","title":"Pre-Columbian period in Venezuela"},{"id":"35886606","text":"Gregory Orfalea is an American writer, the author or editor of nine books, including his most recent works, the biography Journey to the Sun: Junipero Serra's Dream and the Founding of California (Scribner, 2014) and a short story collection, The Man Who Guarded the Bomb (Syracuse UP, 2010). == Background == Orfalea was born and raised in Los Angeles, California.

There was also for a few years a German colony at Klein-Venedig. The 16th- and 17th- century colonial economy was centered on gold mining and livestock farming. The relatively small number of colonists employed indigenous farmers on their haciendas, and enslaved other indigenous people and, later, Africans to work in the mines. The Venezuelan territories were governed at different times from the distant capitals of the Viceroyalties of New Spain and Peru. In the 18th century, cocoa plantations grew up along the coast, worked by further importations of African slaves. Cacao beans became Venezuela's principal export, monopolized by the Compañía Guipuzcoana de Caracas. Most of the surviving indigenous people had by then migrated to the south, where Spanish friars were active. Intellectual activity increased among the white Creole elite, centered on the university at Caracas. The Province of Venezuela was included in the Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1717, and became the Captaincy General of Venezuela in 1777. The independence struggle began in 1810 while Spain was engaged in the Peninsular War. The Venezuelan War of Independence ensued. The Republic of Gran Colombia became independent from Spain in 1821 under the leadership of Simón Bolívar, and Venezuela separated from that Republic in 1830. ==Exploration== Christopher Columbus sailed along the eastern coast of Venezuela on his third voyage in 1498, the only one of his four voyages to reach the South American mainland. This expedition discovered the so-called \\"Pearl Islands\\" of Cubagua and Margarita off the northeastern coast of Venezuela. Later Spanish expeditions returned to exploit these islands' once abundant pearl oysters, enslaving the indigenous people of the islands and harvesting the pearls so intensively that they became one of the most valuable resources of the incipient Spanish Empire in the Americas between 1508 and 1531, by which time both the local indigenous population and the pearl oysters had become devastated. The Spanish expedition led by Alonso de Ojeda, sailing along the length of the northern coast of South America in 1499, gave the name Venezuela (\\"little Venice\\" in Spanish) to the Gulf of Venezuela — because of its imagined similarity to the Italian city. ==Early colonization== Spain's colonization of mainland Venezuela started in 1502 when it established its first permanent South American settlement in the present- day city of Cumaná (then called Nueva Toledo), which was founded officially in 1515 by Franciscan friars. A palafito like the ones seen by Amerigo Vespucci At the time of the Spanish arrival (Pre-Columbian period in Venezuela), indigenous people lived mainly in groups as agriculturists and hunters: along the coast, in the Andean mountain range, and along the Orinoco River. In 1527 Santa Ana de Coro was founded by Juan de Ampíes, the first governor of the Spanish Empire's Venezuela Province. Coro would be the Province's capital until 1546 followed by El Tocuyo (1546 - 1577), until the capital was moved to Caracas in 1577 Distrito Capital by Juan de Pimentel. Klein-Venedig (Little Venice) was the most significant part of the German colonization of the Americas, from 1528 to 1546, in which the Augsburg-based Welser banking family obtained colonial rights in Venezuela Province in return for debts owed by Charles I of Spain. The primary motivation was the search for the legendary golden city of El Dorado. The venture was initially led by Ambrosius Ehinger, who founded Maracaibo in 1529. After the deaths of first Ehinger (1533) and then his successor Nikolaus Federmann, Georg von Speyer (1540), Philipp von Hutten continued exploration in the interior, and in his absence from the capital of the province the crown of Spain claimed the right to appoint the governor. On Hutten's return to the capital, Santa Ana de Coro, in 1546, the Spanish governor Juan de Carvajal had Hutten and Bartholomeus Welser executed. Subsequently, Charles I revoked Welser's charter. By the middle of the 16th century not many more than 2,000 Europeans lived in present-day Venezuela. The opening of gold mines at Yaracuy led to the introduction of slavery, at first involving the indigenous population, then imported Africans. The first real economic success of the colony involved the raising of livestock, much helped by the grassy plains known as Llanos. The society that developed as a result – a handful of Spanish landowners and widely dispersed Indian herdsmen on Spanish-introduced horses – recalls primitive feudalism, certainly a powerful concept in the 16th-century Spanish imagination, and (perhaps more fruitfully) bears comparison in economic terms with the latifundia of antiquity. During the 16th and 17th centuries the cities which constitute today's Venezuela suffered relative neglect. The Viceroyalties of New Spain and Peru (located on the sites formerly occupied by the capital cities of the Aztecs and Incas respectively) showed more interest in their nearby gold- and silver-mines than in the remote agricultural societies of Venezuela. Responsibility for the Venezuelan territories shifted to and fro between the two Viceroyalties. ==New Granada and Captaincy General (1717 - 1812)== Historia de la conquista y población de la Provincia de Venezuela (1723), by José de Oviedo y Baños The Province of Venezuela came under the jurisdiction of the Viceroyalty of New Granada (established in 1717). The Province became the Captaincy General of Venezuela in 1777. In the 18th century a second Venezuelan society formed along the coast with the establishment of cocoa plantations manned by much larger importations of African slaves. Quite a number of black slaves also worked in the haciendas of the grassy llanos. Most of the Amerindians who still survived had perforce migrated to the plains and jungles to the south, where only Spanish friars took an interest in them — especially the Franciscans or Capucins, who compiled grammars and small lexicons for some of their languages. The most important friar misión (the name for an area of friar activity) developed in San Tomé in the Guayana Region. The Compañía Guipuzcoana de Caracas held a close monopoly on trade with Europe. The Guipuzcoana company stimulated the Venezuelan economy, especially in fostering the cultivation of cacao beans, which became Venezuela's principal export.Arcila Farias, Eduardo, Economia colonicla de Venezuela (1946) It opened Venezuelan ports to foreign commerce, but this recognized a fait accompli. Like no other Spanish American dependency, Venezuela had more contacts with Europe through the British and French islands in the Caribbean. In an almost surreptitious, though legal, manner, Caracas itself had become an intellectual powerhouse. From 1721 it had its own university (Central University of Venezuela), which taught Latin, medicine and engineering, apart (of course) from the humanities. Its most illustrious graduate, Andrés Bello (1781–1865), became the greatest Spanish American polymath of his time. In Chacao, a town to the east of Caracas, there flourished a school of music whose director José Ángel Lamas (1775–1814) produced a few but impressive compositions according with the strictest 18th-century European canons. ==Independence== The 19th of April, 1810. Painting by Juan Lovera (1835) Some Venezuelans began to grow resistant to colonial control towards the end of the eighteenth century. Spain's neglect of its Venezuelan colony contributed to Venezuelan intellectuals' increased zeal for learning. The colony had more external sources of information than other more \\"important\\" Spanish dependencies, not excluding the viceroyalties, although one should not belabor this point, for only the mantuanos (a Venezuelan name for the white Creole elite) had access to a solid education. (Another name for the mantuanos class, grandes cacaos, reflected the source of their wealth. To this day in Venezuela the term can apply to a presumptuous person.) The mantuanos showed themselves presumptuous, overbearing and zealous in affirming their privileges against the pardo (mixed-race) majority of the population. The first organized conspiracy against the colonial regime in Venezuela occurred in 1797, organized by Manuel Gual and José María España. It took direct inspiration from the French Revolution, but was put down with the collaboration of the \\"mantuanos\\" because it promoted radical social changes. The general Francisco de Miranda hero of French Revolution has long been associated with the struggle of the Spanish colonies in Latin America for independence. Miranda envisioned an independent empire consisting of all the territories that had been under Spanish and Portuguese rule, stretching from the Mississippi River to Cape Horn. This empire was to be under the leadership of a hereditary emperor called the \\"Inca\\", in honor of the great Inca Empire, and would have a bicameral legislature. He conceived the name Colombia for this empire, after the explorer Christopher Columbus. With informal British help, general Miranda led an attempted invasion of the Captaincy General of Venezuela in 1804. At the time, Britain was at war with Spain, an ally of Napoleon. In November 1805, Miranda travelled to New York, where privately began organizing a filibustering expedition to liberate Venezuela. Miranda hired a ship of 20 guns, which he rebaptized Leander in honor of his oldest son, and set sail to Venezuela on 2 February 1806 but failed in an attempt of landing in Ocumare de la Costa. Miranda spent the next year in the British Caribbean waiting for reinforcements that never came. On his return to Britain, he was met with better support for his plans from the British government. In 1808 a large military force to attack Venezuela was assembled and placed under the command of Arthur Wellesley, but Napoleon's invasion of Spain suddenly transformed Spain into an ally of Britain, and the force instead went there to fight in the Peninsular War. European events sowed the seeds of Venezuela's declaration of independence. The Napoleonic Wars in Europe not only weakened Spain's imperial power, but also put Britain (unofficially) on the side of the independence movement. In May 1808, Napoleon demanded and received the abdication of Ferdinand VII of Spain and the confirmation of the abdication of Ferdinand's father Charles IV. Napoleon then appointed as King of Spain his own brother Joseph Bonaparte. That marked the beginning of Spain's own War of Independence from French hegemony and partial occupation, before the Spanish American wars of independence even began. The focal point of Spanish political resistance, the Supreme Central Junta, formed to govern in the name of Ferdinand. The first major defeat that Napoleonic France suffered occurred at the Battle of Bailén, in Andalusia (July 1808). (At this battle Pablo Morillo, future commander of the army that invaded New Granada and Venezuela; Emeterio Ureña, an anti-independence officer in Venezuela; and José de San Martín, the future Liberator of Argentina and Chile, fought side by side against the French General Pierre Dupont.) Despite this Spanish victory, the French soon regained the initiative and advanced into southern Spain. The Spanish government had to retreat to the island redoubt of Cádiz. Here the Supreme Central Junta dissolved itself and set up a five-person regency to handle the affairs of state until the full Cortes of Cádiz could convene. Word of these events soon reached Caracas, but only on 19 April 1810 did its \\"cabildo\\" (city council) decide to follow the example set by the Spanish provinces two years earlier, declaring the First Republic of Venezuela. Other provincial capitals as Barcelona, Cumaná, Mérida, La Asuncion, Barinas and Trujillo, followed suit. Although the new Junta Suprema de Caracas had self-appointed élite members who claimed to represent the pardos (free blacks and even slaves), the new government eventually faced the challenge of maintaining the alliance with the pardos. Given recent history these groups still had grievances against the mantuanos. A segment of the mantuanos (among them a 27-year-old Simón Bolívar, the future Liberator) saw the setting up of the Junta as a step toward outright independence. The Venezuelan War of Independence ensued. It ran concurrently with that of New Granada. Humbert, Jules, Historia de Colombia y Venezuela, desde sus orígenes hasta nuestros días (1985) On 17 December 1819 the Congress of Angostura declared Gran Colombia an independent country. After two more years of war, the country achieved independence from Spain in 1821 under the leadership of its most famous son, Simón Bolívar. Venezuela, along with the countries of Colombia, Panama, and Ecuador, formed part of the Republic of Gran Colombia until 1830, when Venezuela separated and became a separate sovereign country. ==Further reading== *Acosta Saignes, Miguel.

Childs continued to claim the title during Byers' reign, and fought former colored heavyweight champ Bob Armstrong on 4 March 1899 in Cincinnati, Ohio in a fight announced as being for the title. Byers next fought Childs, who was billing himself as the \\"black heavyweight title\\" holder, on 16 March at the Star Athletic Club in Chicago. Byers had put his colored heavyweight title on the line and emerged victorious, winning a decision in a six-round contest. One year later, on 16 March 1901, Byers lost his title to Childs when the ex- champ KO-ed him in the 17th round of a 20-round title bout. They never fought again. ==Record== Byers racked up a record of 20 wins (17 by knock out) against seven losses (knocked out four times) and 20 draws. ==Legacy & Honors== In 2020 award-winning author Mark Allen Baker published the first comprehensive account of The World Colored Heavyweight Championship, 1876-1937, with McFarland & Company, a leading independent publisher of academic & nonfiction books. This history traces the advent and demise of the Championship, the stories of the talented professional athletes who won it, and the demarcation of the color line both in and out of the ring. For decades the World Colored Heavyweight Championship was a useful tool to combat racial oppression-the existence of the title a leverage mechanism, or tool, used as a technique to counter a social element, “drawing the color line.” ==References== Category:1872 births Category:1937 deaths Category:Black Canadian boxers Category:Canadian male boxers Category:Heavyweight boxers Category:Sportspeople from Charlottetown Category:World colored heavyweight boxing champions Category:World colored middleweight boxing champions ","title":"George Byers (boxer)"},{"id":"35886682","text":"Fyfield and Tubney is a civil parish in The Vale of White Horse district of Oxfordshire, England.Parish and Town Councils in Oxfordshire - Feb 2012, Accessed 20 May 2012 It includes the village of Fyfield which is about west of Abingdon and Tubney, which is about west of Abingdon.

The network science methodology offers an alternative way of analyzing the patterns of relationships, composition and activities of people studied in their own historical context. Since prosopography examines the whole of a past society, its individuals who made it up, and its structure, this independent science of social history uses a collective study of biographies of a well-defined group, in a multiple career analysis,\\"multiple career-line analysis (as the social scientists call it)\\", Lawrence Stone remarked, in \\"Prosopography\\", Daedalus 100.1 (1971), pp 46-71. for collecting and interpreting relevant quantities of data, these same set of data can be employed for constructing a network of the studied group. Prosopographical network studies have emerged as a young and dynamic field in historical research; nevertheless, the category of prosopographical network is in its formative, initial phase and as a consequence it is hard to view as a stable and defined notion in history and beyond social network analysis. See also narrative network. == Overview == With the advent of the study of complex systems, graph theory provides analysts of historical groups and collective lives with relatively simple tools for answering questions such as: how many degrees of separation on average separate all members of the prosopographical group? Which historical character is connected to the most other members of the studied range? How densely or loosely connected was the group as a whole? Such questions hold a natural interest for prosopographers, who can then begin to look for certain characteristics –class, office, occupation, gender, faction, ethnic background – and identify patterns of connectivity that they might have otherwise missed when confronted with a mass of data too large for normal synthetic approaches. The concepts and methods of social network analysis in historical research are recently being used not only as a mere metaphor but are increasingly applied in practice == Background == The analysis and interpretation of prosopographical networks is an interdisciplinary field of study in social studies and humanities. This field emerged from philology, history, genealogical studies, and sociology and social network analysis. The term \\"prosopography\\" comes from the word prosopoeia, a figure in classical rhetoric in which an imagined person is figured and represented as if present. Claude Nicolet defined the main of prosopography as the history of groups as elements in political and social history, achieved by isolating series of persons having certain political or social characteristics in common and then analyzing each series in terms of multiple criteria, in order both to obtain information specific to individuals and to identify the constants and the variables among the data for whole groups. According to Lawrence Stone, prosopography had become a two-fold tool for historical research: 1) it helps to unveil interests and connections hidden or unclear in the narrative (i.e. rhetoric, historiography, etc.), and 2) it allows analysing the shifting roles in a community and the changing composition of society though genealogy, legal-institutional position, and inter-personal relations. For both uses, understanding connections and studying the evolution of a group, network analysis presents a helpful and feasible methodological framework for measuring quantities and interpreting data. By applying the methods of social network analysis, the approaches of prosopography can be quantified, graphed, and assessed. Together with other complex systems studies, prosopographical networks form part of the field of network science. In the field of historical studies, the term network has been used in a metaphorical sense alone for a long time. The sociological focus, despite the vast spectrum of tools and methods at its disposal, does not deal with limited extraction of relational data from fragmentary and even contradictory sources. Along with the paucity of sources, this hampers the comprehensive, valid and meaningful application of methods drawn from social network analysis. Despite these obstacles, the relational perspective of network analysis has helped historical research and prosopography to gain an entirely new methodological vantage point. Social network theory may be able to overcome conceptual and epistemological difficulties presented by historical objects of study and historical sources. Constructing a prosopographical network can offer an alternative, more fluid interpretation of communities in the past, which allows us to take account of coexisting, sometimes overlapping, networks of different sources and geographical delimitations. == Pioneer works == *Ruffini, Giovanni, and Shawn Graham. “Network Analysis and Greco-Roman Prosopography.” In Prosopography approaches and applications: A handbook.

Abbott used prosopography to construct a group biography of women secretarial workers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in The Angel in the Office (2009). *Sociologist Michael Erben explored the use of prosopography to investigate what might be called a street biography in \\"A Preliminary Prosopography of the Victorian Street\\", (1996). Sourced mainly from census records, the data used included not only the demography but also the spatial classifications, occupations, and domestic arrangements of a street in Victorian Oxford. This material forms what Erben describes as an Unaffiliated or Disinterested Group, i.e. spatial locale may be all inhabitants had in common, unlike Intentional Groups, with explicit shared interests, found in more traditional prosopography. The work shows that such Unaffiliated Groups can yield much information on subjects such as social mobility in a given place and time. *Debra Nails compiled a prosopography of Plato and other Socratics by exploring the biographies of each person mentioned in the Socratic literature in an attempt to explore how Socrates interacted with others.

The butte lies on the west bank of the south-flowing Colorado River. The outfall from the Little Colorado River, draining from the Painted Desert to the east and southeast, is about 2-mi upstream. Temple Butte is in elevation. It is the historical site of some wreckage of the 1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision. It was first thought that smoke from Temple Butte, was due to a lightning strike fire, but later was found to be the result of the mid-air collision. UAL & TWA crash sites. A closer view of Chuar and Temple Buttes. ==Trails== The Tanner Trail from Desert View, Arizona down to the Colorado River, follows the west ridgeline of Tanner Canyon, and has numerous views looking due-north to Temple Butte. The trail ends at a viewpoint on the upper surfaces of a Redwall Limestone ridge. The Redwall Limestone is seen prominently below the East Rim, and is the cliff-forming shelf upon which the redbeds of the Supai Group accumulate. ==Geology== The prominence of Temple Butte is composed of the Toroweap Formation, and below it, the tan or white, cross-bedded (fossil sand-dunes) of the Coconino Sandstone. The Coconino is a cliff-forming unit. The Hermit Formation and Supai Group \\"redbeds\\" below begin the base of the butte, as the slope-forming geological units. The east strike (section) of the Butte Fault is on the west side of Temple Butte. The west section of the Butte Fault is the East Kaibab Monocline. The Butte Fault sections are north-south trending, and are part of the uplift of the Kaibab Plateau. ==Access== Desert View is the closest paved route site to Temple Butte viewpoints. It is located on the East Rim, and is about 20-mi east of Grand Canyon Village, on the East Rim Road, (Arizona State Route 64).

The original building was constructed for Samuel Andrews in 1815. Around 1848, a frame wing was added to the brick structure for a tavern. Though the wing was added to the original residence, there is no interior connection between the two. The tavern is an example of Federal provincial architecture. In 1778, the county seat of Spotsylvania County was moved to Andrews Tavern area which was a central location in the county. The county seat remained at Andrews Tavern until it was moved to its present location at Spotsylvania Court House in 1839. Since the construction of the building, it has served a number of purposes including United States Post Office (1842–1862) and, during the American Civil War, Confederate post office (1862–1865). During his ownership of the building, Samuel Andrews was postmaster for the governments of both the Confederate States of America and the United States. The building has also served as a school and a polling place. The location of the tavern, near the intersection of two major roads, made it a central social and political gathering place. Both the Whigs and the Democrats promoted their parties on election days in the 1840s with parades, banners, and free whiskey for voters. In 1885, the building once again housed a post office. As of 1999, Andrews Tavern was a private residence. The property has been designated as a Virginia Historic Landmark and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in July 1976. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Andrew's Tavern NRHP Nomination Form (1976) Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:Federal architecture in Virginia Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1815 Category:Buildings and structures in Spotsylvania County, Virginia Category:Taverns in Virginia Category:Drinking establishments on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Spotsylvania County, Virginia Category:1815 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Andrews Tavern (Spotsylvania County, Virginia)"},{"id":"35886825","text":"The Bayer designation Eta Doradus (η Dor / η Doradus) is shared by two stars, in the constellation Dorado: *η¹ Doradus *η² Doradus Doradus, Eta Category:Dorado (constellation) ","title":"Eta Doradus"},{"id":"35886833","text":"\\"Sorry But I\\" is a song and the first single by South Korean girl group C-REAL.

Starring Richard Dix, it was similar to many of the period films that appeared to glorify the \\"knights of the air\\", but was more complex, examining the motivations of those who choose to go to war.Neibaur 2005, p. 1. ==Plot== When the United States enters World War I, Rocky Thorne has no interest in joining the military, but just wants to pursue his career as a sculptor. He is cynical about the purpose of the war and the enthusiasm of those who have enlisted, comparing them to lemmings that will swim until they drown themselves. But his fiancée, Nancy Adams, becomes a Red Cross nurse; she mocks his pacifism and accuses him of cowardice. To prove his bravery, he enlists and becomes a fighter pilot as part of the American Expeditionary Forces. Arriving at his assigned squadron, he is concerned about the people he is going to be shooting at; but his initial reluctance lasts only until he is shot at himself. Then he retaliates, shooting down his first enemy aircraft. Rocky now renounces his past attitude and becomes completely committed to the war in the air, even taking individual flights against orders, to get more chances to shoot down Germans. In a few months he becomes the leading ace. Then, while on furlough in Paris, he runs into his former love, who is a nurse on the front lines. She has been impacted by her experiences and is torn by guilt. When Rocky says that he does not want to waste his valuable leave time on talking and demeans her moral attitude for not wanting to spend the night with him, she agrees to do it. Back at the squadron, a German cadet on a mercy mission drops a note over the airfield, telling the Americans that one of their pilots who was shot down is alive as a prisoner. At this point Rocky's plane appears. Not having seen the note being dropped, Rocky attacks and shoots down the young German, who is badly injured but not killed. At the hospital, Rocky finds the German in the next bed. The young man is in agony and is not allowed liquids because of a stomach wound. Eventually he begs for water, saying he is going to die anyway, and Rocky leaves a bottle of wine by his bedside. Then Rocky is told he is being transferred away from the front to become an instructor. While he does not tell anyone, he feels guilty over the German's death, so the transfer comes as a relief. But before it takes effect, he learns that a young pilot has bettered his record of victories. He flies another unauthorized mission to fight individually against the newest German aircraft. But as he prepares to close in for the kill, he again thinks about the German cadet, and is unable to fire. The Germans see him and shoot him down, but he lives to return home to his sweetheart after the war. In the final scene, he still feels guilty for what he became, and says he has been unable to sculpt. But Nancy is supportive and still wants to marry him. They will get past it together. ==Cast== William Cagney, the brother of James Cagney made his motion picture debut in Ace of Aces as an actor and went on to become a Hollywood producer.\\"Notes: Ace of Aces (1933).\\" Turner Classic Movies.

He also debuted a song featuring Daniel Tosh after the interview. Later in October, he also released \\"Halloween\\". In November 2012, Krispy Kreme was featured in a Mashable article that listed fifteen people made famous by the internet. His eleventh song, titled \\"Christmas\\", was released on November 21, 2012. Several of Froggy's music videos feature a recurring antagonist, James. === Froggy Fresh era ===  Money Maker (Reloaded)  On December 3, 2012, Froggy Fresh stated on his YouTube channel that his father received a call from the Krispy Kreme doughnut company telling him that his name was trademark infringement. He also stated that he could not use any variation of the words 'Krispy' or 'Kreme' without facing legal problems. Froggy Fresh (still \\"Krispy Kreme\\" at the time) announced that he would be changing his rap name to one of the following, depending on viewer comments: Froggy Fresh, Candy Cane, Jelly Bean, Jelly Bean Jack, Lil Kuntry or White Chocolate. On December 18, 2012, Kreme officially announced that he changed his name to Froggy Fresh. Prior to changing his name to Froggy Fresh, the rapper was originally going to change his name to Jelly Bean Jack. In December 2012, Froggy Fresh released his debut album, Money Maker (Reloaded) on the iTunes Store. The album featured new songs in addition to existing ones already on his YouTube channel. He also announced he was going to release the music videos for the three previously unreleased songs from the album, \\"ER\\", \\"Mike's Mom\\", and \\"Same Old Kid\\". On January 9, 2013, the music video for \\"Same Old Kid\\", the rapper's first song under the name Froggy Fresh, was released. Froggy Fresh received praise for \\"Same Old Kid\\", as Barstool Sports stated \\"It's one thing to outlive your 15 minutes, it's quite another to change your name, content, and brand and still remain relevant.\\" On January 26, 2013, Money Maker (Re-Loaded), debuted and peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Comedy Album chart. Froggy Fresh deleted all his music videos that featured the moniker \\"Krispy Kreme\\", before re-posting the videos on February 15, switching \\"Krispy Kreme\\" to \\"Froggy Fresh\\". In February 2013, Froggy released an announcement video that also included a freestyle. The music video for \\"Mike's Mom\\" was released on March 4, 2013. In March 2013, John Cena spoke about Froggy Fresh, during an interview, praising the rapper. Dream Team On May 21, 2013, Froggy Fresh released the single, \\"Dunked On\\", which Froggy previously revealed would appear on his second album. On September 16, 2013, Froggy Fresh uploaded an Instagram picture of him and Mike wearing NFL-themed sweaters, with the caption \\"Me and mike doing a new video.\\" On January 18, 2014, Froggy reiterated that he was working on his second album, tweeting that it would likely be released in the summer of 2014. Later in February, Froggy announced he would be starting to upload new music videos in May 2014, which began with the May 6 release of \\"Stolen Bikes 2\\", a revisit of one of his earlier hits, \\"Stolen Bikes\\". On June 19, Froggy released the music video for \\"Street Rangers\\", a song making references to the Power Rangers and Predator. The album, confirmed to be titled Dream Team, was released in October 2014, on iTunes. On October 8, 2014, Froggy Fresh released a trailer for his second album, which featured scenes from unreleased music videos of songs in the album. The album featured 12 songs, including the already released tracks, \\"Dunked On\\", \\"Stolen Bikes 2\\", and \\"Street Rangers\\". The album included seven other original songs, titled, \\"Halloween II\\", \\"Reindeer Games\\", \\"Friday the 13th\\", \\"Fun Trip\\", \\"Push Me\\", \\"You Gon Get There\\", and \\"Go Kart Love\\". The remaining two tracks were remixes, with one being of \\"Halloween II\\", and the other of \\"Push Me\\". Shortly after the album was released, Froggy continued music videos for the album's tracks, moving along with \\"Halloween II\\". After subsequently releasing music videos for \\"Reindeer Games\\", \\"Friday the 13th\\", and \\"Fun Trip\\", Froggy released a non- album single, as well as its music video, titled \\"Jimmy Butler Is Your Father\\". The song's lyrics center on praising Chicago Bulls basketball player Jimmy Butler, as well as the entire Bulls franchise, and extend their focus to insult the Cleveland Cavaliers, and their star small forward, LeBron James. Froggy would release the track and music video on May 9, 2015, one day after the Chicago Bulls defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in the third game of their Eastern Conference Semi-finals series. However, the Bulls would lose their following game and end up losing their best of seven series against the Cavaliers. Froggy then released five other singles over the next few months: \\"Street Rangers 2\\", a sequel to the first Street Rangers song; \\"Nightmare on My Street\\", a spiritual successor to the first two Halloween songs; \\"Zombie in my Basement\\", in which Froggy Fresh plays board games against a slow-witted zombie; \\"Good Guy Shoes\\", in which Fresh is possessed by the titular footwear in a manner similar to Chucky from the Child's Play series, and \\"Stolen Bikes 3\\", the supposed end to the Stolen Bike series of songs.  Escape from Hood Mountain and touring  In September 2016, Froggy Fresh pinned a comment across many of his videos, addressing the fan-expressed concern of a lack of videos since \\"Stolen Bikes 3\\", released five months prior. The comment stated that, while no releases were scheduled for Fall 2016 through Spring 2017, they did plan to release 13–15 new videos between Summer 2017 and 2020, as part of a double-disk album tentatively known as Escape from Hood Mountain. The comment went on to state that Escape from Hood Mountain will \\"probably be the last album for our project, as we are all starting to grow up.\\" On February 21, 2017, Cassidy uploaded a video on YouTube, which has since been removed from his channel, explaining the story behind the Krispy Kreme/Froggy Fresh project. In the 23-minute video, Cassidy revealed that Froggy Fresh was indeed a comedic character created after years of struggling to gain attention as a serious rap artist. Despite stating that he truly enjoyed the five years of making videos, Cassidy revealed that it eventually became boring for him and that the friends who populated his videos had gone in different directions in their respective lives. He also expressed his interest in becoming a comedic actor. Despite this statement, Froggy Fresh announced his first tour with the inaugural show held April 28, 2017 in Charlotte, North Carolina with DJ Justin Aswell. Subsequent shows in June 2017 took place in the Southeastern United States and featured Froggy Fresh alongside Money Maker Mike. Future tour dates for other areas in the U.S. were announced up to October 2017. On February 15, 2018, Cassidy uploaded a new update video on YouTube. He stated that Escape from Hood Mountain had been completed with eighteen tracks. He uploaded the entire album for free for fans to download online. === Tyler Cassidy era === Eponymous YouTube channel and Renee  After releasing Escape from Hood Mountain and going on a tour, Cassidy dropped the Froggy Fresh character and persona; he additionally stopped posting to the Froggy Fresh YouTube account. Cassidy began uploading his new music onto an eponymous YouTube account that was registered in January 2018. As of December 2019, it has accumulated over 200,000 subscribers and 16 million video views. He would go on to upload original and cover songs on the channel. Shortly thereafter, Cassidy once again became popular on the Internet, as his original \\"Junkie\\" song attracted attention on the Reddit r/videos subreddit forum. His piano balladry was particularly noted by The Daily Dot in August 2018. In June 2019, Creative Loafing wrote, \\"with soft piano melodies and honestly pretty offensive lyrics, Cassidy’s internet presence today walks a drunk line between music, comedy and cringe.\\" In October, Cassidy released a non-album track titled \\"Amber Guyger\\", named after and criticizing the police officer found guilty of murdering Botham Jean. On October 30, 2019, Cassidy released Renee, his first post- Froggy Fresh album. The album covers themes including Cassidy's relationship with his mother, his childhood, and personal issues. ==DiscographyAlbums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" + List of albums, with selected chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:9em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:15em;\\"  Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\"  Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\"US Comedy - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Money Maker (Reloaded)  * Released: December 21, 2012 * Formats: CD, digital download  3 - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Dream Team  * Released: October 3, 2014 * Formats: CD, digital download  — - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Escape from Hood Mountain  * Released: February 15, 2018 * Formats: Digital download  — } ==ReferencesCategory:1990s births Category:20th-century American people Category:21st-century American comedians Category:21st-century American male musicians Category:21st-century American pianists Category:21st-century American rappers Category:American comedy musicians Category:American male actors Category:American male pianists Category:American male rappers Category:American male singer-songwriters Category:American YouTubers Category:Internet memes Category:Living people Category:Male YouTubers Category:People from Flint, Michigan Category:Rappers from Michigan Category:Underground rappers ","title":"Froggy Fresh"},{"id":"35886953","text":"Triathalassothia is a genus of toadfishes found in the southwest Atlantic Ocean. ==Species== There are currently two recognized species in this genus: * Triathalassothia argentina (C.

He was born in Brighton, Sussex, England, the eldest son of Colonel Henry Foster, a Tasmanian farmer. His grandfather was John Foster, a Tasmanian farmer, businessman and politician, and his great-uncle was William Foster who had been Solicitor General for New South Wales and member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. After military service during the First World War, Francis Foster was a successful businessman who served as member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly between 1937 and 1941. ==Early Years== Francis Foster's father, Henry Foster, was born in Hobart, Tasmania to John Foster and his wife Ann but, after John's death in 1875, Ann took Henry and his siblings to be educated in England and they settled in Brighton. Henry attended Sandhurst Military Academy but did not obtain a commission and instead returned to Tasmania, where he married in 1887. A few months later, Henry took his new wife to England and Francis was born in Brighton in 1888. The following year, after Henry's brothers had both completed their university studies, the Foster family (Henry, his wife and son, and two sisters and two brothers) all returned to Tasmania. Francis Foster then remained in Australia until after he had completed his own university education. ==Education== Francis Foster studied at Launceston Church Grammar School before entering Trinity College (University of Melbourne) where he obtain a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1911. He briefly worked as a civil engineer, including under Sir John Monash, before travelling to England 1912 with his parents, where he visited a number of industrial establishments. The following year, he travelled through Queensland, visiting pastoral properties. Both trips influenced his future career. ==First World War== In 1915 Francis Foster was commissioned into the Militia and subsequently transferred to the Australian Imperial Force in February 1918, before serving in France with the 4th Field Company, Royal Australian Engineers. He returned to Australia as a lieutenant in August 1919. Both his father, Henry Foster, and younger brother, John Askin Foster, also served in the AIF during WW1. Both were at Gallipoli and John went on to serve in France, where he was killed in action in August 1918. ==Farming and Business Career== As his brother had died during the war, Francis Foster became responsible for the management of the farms that the family owned in Tasmania. From 1925, he extended his interests to Queensland, purchasing land and company shares there. This proved to be a shrewd investment; by 1990, after his death, the Financial Review was able to report that \\"The Foster family wealth is generated by a 51% shareholding in the North Australian Pastoral Company, which controls about 45,000 square kilometres in the Northern Territory and Queensland and has four properties in Tasmania.\\" His other business interests included directorships with several financial and industrial companies in Tasmania. As a respected business leader he chaired the Tasmanian Meat Board and was president of the Tasmanian Farmers Association. ==Public Service== Francis Foster continued the tradition of public service that began with his grandfather and was continued by his father. He was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly in 1937 as a Nationalist member for Wilmot. He lost the seat in 1941 when the Labor Party increased its majority by two seats. Other roles included membership of the Agricultural Bank of Tasmania's postwar land development committee and of the board of inquiry into Bass Strait Islands transport facilities. Between 1943 and 1949, he chaired the Tasmanian committee of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and became a trustee of the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. ==Private Life== In 1929 Francis Foster married Patricia Ainslie Wood in Hobart. They had six children: four daughters and two sons, all born in Hobart. ==Legacy== Francis Foster died at his home Hobart in 1979. He was cremated and his ashes placed in the family vault at Cornelian Bay Cemetery. He left a considerable estate of land and other assets for the benefit of his family. In 1990, the net worth of the Foster Family was estimated to be over A$40 million, and in 2004, his eldest son, Henry Foster, was described by ABC News as the wealthiest man in Tasmania. ==References== Category:1888 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly Category:Nationalist Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Tasmania Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Francis Foster (Tasmanian politician)"},{"id":"35887002","text":"Zagreb Botanical Garden The Zagreb Botanical Garden () is a botanical garden located in downtown Zagreb, Croatia.

Most eels live in the shallow waters of the ocean and burrow into sand, mud, or amongst rocks. A majority of eel species are nocturnal and thus are rarely seen. Sometimes, they are seen living together in holes, or \\"eel pits\\". Some species of eels live in deeper water on the continental shelves and over the slopes deep as . Only members of the family Anguillidae regularly inhabit fresh water, but they too return to the sea to breed.

Similarly, according to the King James version of the Old Testament, it is acceptable to eat fin fish, but fish like eels, which were erroneously believed to lack fins or scales, are an abomination and should not be eaten.\\"All that are in the waters: all that... hath not fins and scales ye may not eat\\" (Deuteronomy 14:9-10) and are \\"an abomination\\" (Leviticus 11:9-12). Japan consumes more than 70 percent of the global eel catch. ==Types of food== Freshwater eels (unagi) and marine eels (anago, conger eel) are commonly used in Japanese cuisine; foods such as unadon and unajuu are popular but expensive. Eels are also very popular in Chinese cuisine and are prepared in many different ways. Hong Kong eel prices have often reached 1000 HKD per kilogram and once exceeded 5000 HKD per kilogram. Eel is also popular in Korean cuisine and is seen as a source of stamina for men. The European eel and other freshwater eels are eaten in Europe, the United States, and other places. Traditional east London foods are jellied eels and pie and mash, although their demand has significantly declined since World War II.

It is located in Shetland, and is part of the Scottish Episcopal Church. It is arguably the most remote community (by location) within the Anglican Communion. The Rule of the community is a mixture of Franciscan and Cistercian, but with heavy Celtic influences. ==History== The community dates its origin from 1984 when the Reverend Mother Mary Agnes arrived on the island of Fetlar to live a contemplative and isolated life of prayer. She took over a simple cottage with a small barn suitable for conversion to a chapel. Others began to visit, or stay, and in 1988 the Society was named and came into existence as a group, rather than an individual. Mother Mary Agnes was formally recognised as Superior by the Church in 1993.See the community's own webpage. ==Community== Convent buildings were originally developed on Fetlar. The main convent house was a safe and secure modern building, and a new chapel was built on the convent site, dedicated to \\"Christ the Encompasser and all his Angels\\". A version of the community's Rule is followed by a number of 'external oblates', who support the community, and live under simple promises, but not full monastic vows. In 2015, the community moved to the island of Unst where more medical and social care is available than on Fetlar; one Sister now lives in sheltered care at Uyeasound. A new chapel and community house have been built at Westing on the Atlantic coast of Unst. The community's buildings on Fetlar have been sold. ==Chapels== The Byre Chapel was the original place of worship developed from a barn. It was noteworthy for its simple and rustic style of construction and furnishing. The opposite end retained its traditional use, as the SOLI community goat lived there.

Born into the patriciate of the port town of Skien, he was the son of shipowner Ole Paus and Johanne Plesner (formerly married Ibsen). He was the uncle of playwright Henrik Ibsen, as he was both the half brother of Ibsen's father Knud Ibsen and the first cousin of Ibsen's mother Marichen Altenburg. He was the brother of judge, Bratsberg governor and Member of Parliament Christian Cornelius Paus and lawyer Henrik Johan Paus. Christopher Blom Paus owned the house at Snipetorp where the Ibsen family lived from the time of Henrik Ibsen's confirmation in 1843 to 1865.J. Borchsenius, Skien før branden 1886, Fabritius & Sønners Forlag, Oslo, 1934 Paus started as a wholesaler and eventually concentrated mainly on shipping business. He entered his business career as a clerk in his brother's trading shop. Paus worked from the late 1820s until 1836 for merchant Christopher Hansen Blom in the Blom trading house. In the 1860s he invested heavily in shipping and entered the emigrant trade with runs between Trondheim, Québec and Newcastle. He later became one of Skien's leading shipowner and one of the leader businessman. He was a city councilor in Skien for several years and held other public offices. In addition to being a ship-owner, he was administrative director of the savings bank, Skiens Sparebank 1874–1887. He was a member of the city council in Skien for several years and held a number of other public positions.Einar Østvedt, Skiens historie: Fra 1870 til ca. 1925, Skien Municipality/Erik St. Nilssen, 1959, pp. 358–359 ==Personal life== Christopher Blom Paus was married in 1845 to Erasmine Ernst (1817–1914) He was the father of factory owner Ole Paus. His grandson Herman Paus married Countess Tatyana Tolstoy, a granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy. Their descendants own Herresta and other Swedish estates. He was also the great-grandfather of General Ole Paus and the great-great-grandfather of singer Ole Paus.

It is considered endangered and has less than 6,000 speakers worldwide.Endangered Languages Project - http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/3700 ==Geographical distribution== Aimol is spoken primarily in the Tengnoupal Chandel, Kangpokpi, and Churachandpur districts of Manipur.Haokip, P. (2011). The languages of manipur: A case study of the Kuki-Chin languages. Linguistics Of The Tibeto- Burman Area, 34(1), 85-118. Aimol is spoken in the following villages of Manipur state (Ethnologue). There are also small numbers of speakers in Assam. *Tengnoupal district:Aimol Khullen, Satu, Kumbirei, Chingunghut, Aimol Tampak, Khodamphai, Ngairong Aimol, Chandonpokpi, Sibong (Khudengthabi), and Khomayai (Khunjai) *Chandel district : Unapal *Kangpokpi district: Tuikhang, Kharam aimol *Churachandpur district: Luichungbum (Louchulbung), kha-aimol ==Name== The name of the language comes from the Aimol tribe of people who speak it. The word Aimol itself may come from the words Ai meaning \\"wild turmeric\\" which would be found in the hill Mol.Suantak, K. (2011). Socio-Linguistic Paradigm of the Aimol. Language In India, 11(6), 36-49. == Genealogical affiliation == Aimol is an Old Kuki language. The language displays similar characteristics as other Old Kuki including Kom, Mhar/Hmar, and Chiru. However, most of the Old Kuki languages are not mutually intelligible with Aimol. Additionally, Aimol is reportedly less influenced by Meitei, the lingua franca of the state of Manipur, as compared to the other neighboring languages.Ruhemann, B. (1948). The Relationship Terms of Some Hill Tribes of Burma and Assam. Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, 4, 155-198. Aimol is mutually intelligible with Kom. Speakers of the respective languages can understand each other when speaking in their own language. In terms of numeric structures, the two languages demonstrate extreme grammatical and structural similarities. In the Linguistic Survey of India, Grierson reported that all the Old Kuki languages, including Aimol, are all merely dialects of the same language. He also reported that these Old Kuki languages are closely related to the Central Kuki languages.Grierson, G. A. (1903). Linguistic Survey of India, 3. (reprint: 2005. Delhi: Low Price Publications). ==Dialects== The Langrong variety is distinct enough that some consider it a separate language. There are two dialects of Aimol proper, Sutpong and Khurai, which can perhaps be attributed to differing migration patterns. There are small differences between the two but they are completely mutually intelligible. Most occurrences of Aimol writing are of Sutpong. This version makes use of glottal stops in word endings preceding by vowel sounds. Speakers of this dialect tend to take pride in speaking this dialect over Khurai. Khurai usually does not use the glottal stops as is present in Sutpong. There is also less use of initial nasalized sounds in Khurai. There may be negative interpretations of the word Khurai which lead to the negativity with the dialect. Additionally, the Khurai dialect is understood to borrow more words from Meitei and other neighboring languages, though it is indisputable that both dialects take from and are influenced by other languages. == Writing system == There are very few written records of the Aimol language. Much of what has been recorded were samples from Grierson. Younger generations use Latin script, while older generations use \\"Manipuri written in Bengali script.\\" Additionally, a version of the Bible has been recently completed, but not yet released.Welcome to Bible Society of India Aimol New Testament http://www.bsind.org/aimol.html This should greatly benefit the translation and preservation process. ===Syntax=== Aimol follows the traditional subject-object-verb word order, like the other Tibeto-Burman languages, and uses postposition instead of preposition. Tone is an important feature of the language, as the certain pitch used can indicate multiple different words. ===Numerals=== Cardinal numbers in Aimol are formed by using simple addition and/or multiplication compounds. The numbers between 11-19 are formed by taking the word for ten som and the respective number between 1–9, and using the connective word ləj. For example, the word for fifteen is som-ləj-raŋa, which is formed by the words for ten-connective-five. The decade, century, and thousand numbers are formed by using a multiplication compound. To illustrate this principle further, the word for three hundred is , which is formed by the root re-, and the word for three ənthum (the prefix ən- is dropped). Finally, for the numbers not divisible by 10, the two principles are combined. The word for 22 is somniləjthum, which translate to ten-two-connective-two. In this instance, ten and two are multiplied to equal twenty which is connected to two. Ordinal Numerals Ordinal numerals are formed by adding the suffix cəŋnə to the base number. For example, second is expressed as ənni-cəŋnə, meaning two- necessary suffix. Multiplicative Numerals Adding the prefix wəj- to a base numeral results in a multiplicative numeral. Fifth is expressed by wəj- rəŋə, the prefix to the base word for 5. Fractional Numerals To express fractions, the prefix sem- is added to the denominator number, followed by the connective -ə-, and then the word for the numerator. To express the fraction two-fifths, the word in Aimol is sem-rəŋə-ə-ənni. ==Linguistic climateManipur=== The linguistic situation of the state of Manipur is complex and confusing, making it difficult for proper classification and documentation of the dozens of endangered languages in the region. Languages and dialects are classified according to status as a scheduled tribe. Mutually intelligible dialects of the same language can be classified as distinct languages, and mutually unintelligible languages can be classified as dialects of the same language. Additionally, there is difficulty attributed to shifting ethnic loyalties in the region. Peoples with distinct relation to the Old Kuki groups, including the Aimol, have declared themselves as Nagas or as completely separate distinct peoples. This makes it difficult as the Kukish and Naga set of languages have little linguistic similarities and are mutually unintelligible. ===Meitei=== Meitei is the official language of Manipur and the lingua franca amongst the various tribes in the region. Most Aimol speakers are completely fluent in Meitei. Also, it is the language that is taught in school, thus Aimol has to be taught as a second language in the home. The strong influence of the lingua franca is a considerable threat to the continued existence of Aimol and its survival in future generations. However, there have been efforts to preserve the Aimol culture, including the language.Manipur tribe turns to music to preserve culture - The Times of India. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/Manipur-tribe-turns-to-music- to-preserve-culture/articleshow/24060212.cms/ Additionally, Aimol sees a significant use in the personal domain. ===Religion=== The Aimol people are predominantly Christian and this community has helped with preserving the language. The New Testament has been translated, and there are significant audio samples of the language in the form of Bible studies.Global Recordings Network Aimol - http://globalrecordings.net/en/language/3822 While primarily done to spread and maintain the religion, recordings like these are vital to the continued existence of the language. ==See also== *Aimol people *Kuki people *Tibeto-Burman languages *Linguistic Survey of India ==ReferencesFurther reading== #(2013, August 22).

One Queensridge Place is the name given to two residential skyscrapers located on the west side of the Las Vegas Valley in the affluent Queensridge neighborhood of Summerlin, Nevada. Construction began in 2005 and concluded in 2007. The buildings are twins, measuring approximately high. Each tower has 20 constructed floors with curtain wall facades and distinctive architecture. The resulting large windows allow for views of the Las Vegas Strip and the Red Rock Mountains. ==History== The project was originally announced as Versailles in March 1998, to be constructed on 14.5 acres of land adjacent to Summerlin's Badlands Golf Course, near the southwest corner of Rampart Boulevard and Alta Drive. The project would consist of three 12-story towers with a total of 84 condominium units in 10 different floor plans, ranging in size from 3,000 square feet to 13,000 square feet, with prices between $1.1 million and $7.7 million. The project would have offered full-time security, concierge and valet service, a spa, a ballroom, and access to the nearby golf course. Construction, to be handled by Taurus Development a Canada-based international real estate developer was to begin in May 1998, and was scheduled to be completed 14 months later. Five other companies were involved in the project's development, including Peccole Nevada Corporation, which provided part of the property for the project. Condo units for Versailles had gone on sale by April 1999. Taurus Development planned to begin construction the following month, with an expected completion date of early 2001. In December 2000, Peccole Nevada announced that Taurus Development was no longer involved with the project, which Peccole Nevada still planned to construct with a different development team. At that time, Peccole Nevada was also preparing to develop a separate resort on nearby land that would consist of 300 fractional timeshare-like units. A new project was announced in July 2004, as Queensridge Towers. At that time, it was to consist of three 18-story towers and one 14-story tower, with a total of 385 condominium units at an average of 3,850 square feet. The smallest units would be in the 2,000 square-foot range, while eight of the largest units would be 13,000 square feet. The average price for a unit would be $1 million. The first phase of construction two 18-story towers began in April 2005, with the project now named One Queensridge Place. The project, developed by Peccole Nevada and Executive Home Builders, was designed by JMA Architecture Studios, while Perini Building Company served as the general contractor. In November 2005, IDB Development Corporation joined the project as an investment partner. In January 2006, the project received a $250 million construction loan from HSBC. At that time, Perini Building had finished the eighth floor of one tower and the ninth floor of the other tower, which would contain a combined total of 219 units. The towers were topped off in May 2006. As of February 2007, the project was 85 percent sold. Construction had finished by September 2007. The first residents were expected to begin occupying the building early that month. In October and November 2007, One Queensridge Place was cited for water waste by the Las Vegas Valley Water District, which was unaware that a fountain on the property was part of its cooling tower augmentation unit. The water district had banned commercial fountains in 2003, because of a drought. The water district later decided not to fine the property after being informed that the fountain was part of the buildings' cooling system. Engineers believed the cooling system would generate energy savings of 10 to 12 percent for the property. In April 2009, the 219-unit property had only sold six condo units in the past six months because of a recession. To increase sales, the next 10 units were to be sold at a discount of 25 to 50 percent. Prices usually started at $900,000 for a 2,000-square-foot unit. In February 2010, One Queensridge Place had gone a year without selling a condominium unit; 85 units remained unsold, and eight were in default. Singer Pia Zadora purchased a $2 million condo unit at One Queensridge Place in May 2010. By November 2010, 138 condo sales had closed. Sales had improved by April 2013. One Queensridge Place was built at a cost of $400 million. The property's artisans were inspired by landmarks such as Champs-Élysées in Paris, the Parthenon in Athens, and the Trevi Fountain in Rome. One Queensridge Place contains four two-story penthouses, two on each tower. Each penthouse is 16,000 square feet. The property's 20-acre site is approved for two additional towers and a total of 400 units. ==References * Category:Residential buildings completed in 2007 Category:Buildings and structures in Summerlin, Nevada Category:Residential skyscrapers in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Twin towers ","title":"One Queensridge Place"},{"id":"35887365","text":"In mathematical optimization, Wolfe duality, named after Philip Wolfe, is type of dual problem in which the objective function and constraints are all differentiable functions.

The magazine was founded in 1972 by college students at Porter College at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the first issue of the magazine was published in May 1973. Their purpose was to “encourage youngsters to use writing as a way to talk about their lives.” The founder, William Rubel, continues to run the publication today along with Editor Emma Wood and other colleagues from their offices in Santa Cruz, California.About the childrens art foundation Booklist described Stone Soup’s editorial philosophy as, “Children can meet the highest standard of literature and art.” ==Description== Many of Stone Soup's contributors and readership live in the US or Canada, however writers come from over 40 different countries, according to the editors. The magazine publishes issues 11 times a year (monthly except for a combined July/August issue) online and in print, as well as in a print Annual, which collects all the writing from the year, including particularly notable blog posts, into one book. Each issue of Stone Soup contains stories, poems, and art by primarily eight to 13-year- old contributors. Photos of the authors and illustrators accompany their work. The Children’s Art Foundation, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, publishes the magazine. Children’s written stories and poems can be either fiction or non-fiction, and former editor Gerry Mandel told The Washington Times that she searches out work “from the heart” that “combines both beautiful writing and original ideas.” Writing by children is more generally referred to as \\"juvenilia\\". Published authors include an 11-year-old girl who wrote about her family coming together after her mother’s death from breast cancer; a 10-year- old girl whose family survived a hurricane; a 13-year-old boy who remembered how his childhood fort was destroyed by a bulldozer and new construction; and an 11-year-old boy who created an original fiction piece about a boy waking up to find his family has turned into pigs. In 1989, Stone Soup’s editors published an issue focusing solely on the art, stories, and photographs created by Navajo children growing up on an Indian reservation. “We publish work by kids who, like adult writers, ... have things to say.” Mandel said to Curriculum Administrator. ==References *Official website Category:Children's magazines published in the United States Category:Literary magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1973 Category:Magazines published in California Category:Monthly magazines published in the United States ","title":"Stone Soup (magazine)"},{"id":"35887422","text":"Basil Hugh Briggs (1923 – 8 February 1994) was an English Australian physicist, Reader in physics at the University of Adelaide, winner of the Harrie Massey Medal and Prize for outstanding contribution to physics in Australia in 1992.

He was a Junior Scientific Officer, Telecommunications Research Establishment, in Malvern, Worcestershire, from 1942 to 1946. Then he worked at the Radio Research Group, Cavendish Laboratory, from 1946 to 1961. At Cavendish, Briggs joined with a small group to develop a mathematical procedure to deduce the horizontal motion of the ionosphere from radar signals detected on spaced antennas (see Journal of Atmospheric and Terrestrial Physics, 56, 831, 1994). Over many years, Briggs refined this correlation procedure, and was clearly acknowledged as a world leader in this area. The Cavendish Radio Group began winding down in 1961 and Briggs searched for a University post. In 1962, Briggs became Senior Lecturer in Physics, University of Adelaide; a few years later became Reader until he retired.

Crinita, the specific epithet, is derived from Latin (hairy).Les Robinson - Field Guide to the Native Plants of Sydney, page 269 ==Taxonomy== Carolus Linnaeus the Younger described the longhair plume grass in his Supplementum Plantarum in 1781 as Anthoxanthum crinitum. Crinita is derived from the verb crinio \\"I cover with hair\\" and refers to the hairy panicles. Joseph Dalton Hooker gave it its current name in 1853. Longhair plumegrass is the common name in Australia, while clovenfoot plumegrass is a name recorded in America. ==Description== The longhair plume grass is a tufted perennial plant which can reach 1.5 m (5 ft) high.

It is unclear whether it is native or naturalised on Lord Howe Island. It has become naturalised on Maui in the Hawaiian Islands. It grows on sandy or sandstone- based soils. Within the Sydney region, it is found in grassland to open forest communities, associated with woodland trees such as smooth-barked apple (Angophora costata), Sydney peppermint (Eucalyptus piperita), silvertop ash (E. sieberi) and red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera), in scrub with coastal banksia (Banksia integrifolia) and broad-leaved apple (Angophora subvelutina).

Following the third Soviet Championship in 1924, in which he finished a creditable ninth with a score of 9/17, Sozin was awarded the title of Master of Sport; however, he was unable to maintain this level of performance, and was one of several players whose title was revoked in 1935. ==Opening theory contributionsSicilian, Sozin Attack=== The Sozin Attack (also known as the Sozin Variation or the Fischer–Sozin Attack) consists of the move 6.Bc4 against the Sicilian Defence, Classical Variation. Sozin was not the first to play this move – examples can be found dating back to the 19th century; however, he was one of the first to develop the plan of advancing the f-pawn to f5 to put pressure on Black's e6-square after the usual response 6...e6. Sozin played this line during the 1930s, and it became popular from the 1950s, when it was frequently employed by Bobby Fischer. Fischer refined and advanced its theory, leading to the alternative name \\"Fischer–Sozin Attack\\". While the classic Sozin involves castling, another important continuation called the Velimirovic Attack involves the setup 7.Be3, 8.Qe2, 9.0-0-0 with a view to initiating a sharp attack on Black's kingside. A similar line may be played against the Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation, in which Black plays 5...a6 rather than 5...Nc6; in this case 6.Bc4 is sometimes referred to as the \\"Sozin–Najdorf\\". While this line may transpose into a classical Sozin Attack, Black has other options, for example he may choose to develop the queen's knight to d7. This line was also favoured by Fischer, who frequently followed it up with an immediate 7.Bb3. ===Semi-Slav, Meran, Sozin Variation=== In 1925, Sozin published analysis of the move 11...Nxe5 (rather than the previously played 11...axb5) in the Semi- Slav Defense, Meran Variation (ECO D49) in the Queen's Gambit Declined.

It is a high temperature furnace (as shown in figure 1), filled with steam and/or carbon dioxide gas and maintaining a thermal equilibrium at a temperature just above 1200 °C, in which the reforming reaction is at its thermodynamic equilibrium and carbonaceous substance is reformed with the highest efficiency. In December 2000, Kim discovered that the reforming reaction (C + H2O ↔ CO + H2) proceeds at a temperature just above 1200 °C, but not below it. This work was published in International Journal[1] and registered in KR patent, US patent, CN patent, and JP patent. ==Overview== The reformer reforms all carbon atoms of carbonaceous feedstock to produce just syngas, no other hydrocarbons. The high temperature furnace is packed with castables to minimize heat loss in such a way as to maintain the inner temperature of a reduction reactor filled with steam and carbon dioxide (CO2) gas at a temperature just above 1200 °C (aka Kim temperature, see figure 2),Kim Hyun Yong, Method of gasification in IGCC system, INT J HYDROGEN ENERG 32:5088-5093, 2007 and it reforms all carbonaceous substances most efficiently to produce syngas. The produced syngas exits from the reduction reactor at a temperature of 1200 °C. The reduction chamber is heated by super-hot gases (steam and CO2) generated in the syngas burner with oxygen gas. The reduction chamber must be constructed to withstand, physically and chemically, the reforming reaction at 1200 °C. ==Advantages== Both steam reforming and dry reforming are carried out in this reformer; therefore, it is possible to configure the H2/CO ratio by adjusting the H2O/CO2 ratio in the reduction chamber. The reforming reaction is a very specific elementary reaction; all carbon atoms on the left are reformed into carbon monoxide and all hydrogen atoms are reduced to hydrogen gas. The mixture of two product gases is called syngas. These reforming reactions are an endothermic reduction reaction. In contrast, the conventional gasification reaction is a combination of several reactions operating below 1200 °C and the product is a mixture of many gases. ==History of reforming reactions== The process for producing water gas (C + H2O → CO + H2) has been known since the 19th century and it was later found that it is applicable to all carbonaceous substances. Reactions C + H2O ↔ CO + H2 and (-CH2) + H2O → CO + 2H2 are called steam reforming and reactions C + CO2 → 2CO and (-CH2) + CO2 → 2CO + H2, carbon dioxide or dry reforming. The oil industry has used the reforming reactions extensively for the cracking process and to generate hydrogen gas. ==References== Category:Chemical equipment Category:Fuel gas Category:Synthetic fuels ","title":"Kim reformer"},{"id":"35887615","text":"The Bayer designation Psi Lupi (ψ Lup / ψ Lupi) is shared by two stars, in the constellation Lupus (constellation): *ψ¹ Lupi *ψ² Lupi Lupi, Psi Category:Lupus (constellation) ","title":"Psi Lupi"},{"id":"35887621","text":"SLUB (the unqueued slab allocator) is a memory management mechanism intended for the efficient memory allocation of kernel objects which displays the desirable property of eliminating fragmentation caused by allocations and deallocations.

He is the co-founder of Ensemble Studios and Robot Entertainment. ==Ensemble Corporation== In 1989, Tony Allen Goodman founded Ensemble Corporation, an information technology consulting firm based in Dallas, Texas with friends John Boog-Scott, John Calhoun, and Thad Chapman. The company \\"developed its own management and reporting software suite named Command Center, among other products\\" and quickly grew. Under Goodman's leadership, Ensemble Corporation was one of America's fastest-growing companies ranked by the Inc. 500 from 1992–1997, growing to more than 100 employees. The company was ranked #339 in the Inc. 500 in its final year of independence, 1997. Ensemble Corporation was then acquired on 6 April 1998 by USWeb Corporation., however Goodman had started a side project that wasn't included in the deal in 1995, called Ensemble Studios. ==Ensemble Studios== In January 1995 while serving as CEO of Ensemble Corporation, Goodman co-founded Ensemble Studios together with his brother Rick Goodman and John Boog-Scott, while running Ensemble Corporation. Ensemble Studios was formally incorporated in February 1996 and Goodman served as CEO and art director while running the business side of both Ensemble companies with Boog-Scott. After the acquisition of Ensemble Corporation, Goodman stayed with the game-focused spin-off to pursue his passion for games. Soon thereafter, Goodman hired Bruce Shelley, a longtime friend, whom he \\"met at a board game club at the University of Virginia\\" Ensemble Studios released two full titles and two expansions during this period: Age of Empires (1997); Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome (1998); Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings (1999); Age of Empires II: The Conquerors (2000). On 1 May 2001 Microsoft acquired Ensemble Studios as well as the company's intellectual property. Stuart Moulder, general manager of the Games Division at Microsoft commented on the acquisition stating, \\"The depth of talent and the leadership of Tony Goodman is a winning combination, and this acquisition will help strengthen our mutual commitment to remaining a PC games industry leader.\\" ==Microsoft Years== While at Microsoft, Goodman served as the studio director at Ensemble Studios. Goodman served in this role until the studio was closed by Microsoft on 29 January 2009 following the completion of Halo Wars. \\"After the closure, the Ensemble leadership team will form a new studio and has agreed to provide ongoing support for Halo Wars as well as work on other projects with Microsoft Game Studios. During this period, the studio shipped five titles: Age of Mythology (2002), Age of Mythology: The Titans (2003), Age of Empires III (2005), Age of Empires III: The WarChiefs (2006), Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties (2007), and Halo Wars (2009). Goodman, \\"left behind a tradition of entrepreneurship. Goodman founded Robot Entertainment the next month. Several startups arose from the ashes, spearheaded by former employees, including Bonfire Studios, Newtoy, Windstorm Studios, Pixelocity, Fuzzy Cube, and GRL Games.\\" ==Robot Entertainment== In 2009, Goodman was the founding CEO of Robot Entertainment when the company defined its strategy to work on smaller original IP titles. Robot finished up the work on Halo Wars after the closing of Ensemble Studios and was the original developer of Age of Empires Online. In February 2009, days after Robot Entertainment was announced, Goodman presented his old friend, Bruce Shelley with the AIAS Hall of Fame Award at the 2009 DICE Summit in Las Vegas. Goodman left Robot Entertainment to pursue a new venture in the games industry in mid-2010. Goodman was quoted as saying, \\"My contributions as CEO at Robot were completed after we successfully transitioned from a vision to a flourishing game studio.\\" ==PeopleFun== On 17 July 2012, Goodman announced the founding of his newest company, PeopleFun (stylized as peoplefün), along with John Boog-Scott, co- founder of Ensemble Corporation and Ensemble Studios, Angelo Laudon, who was employee No. 1 at Ensemble Studios and lead programmer on the Age of Empires engine; and Leon Campise, a serial entrepreneur in the technology space. PeopleFun will focus on making games for iOS and Android that are character driven franchises instead of large games such as those created at Ensemble. On 13 September 2012, PeopleFun launched its first mobile game, Word Chums, a word game for iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch devices.

It has nasalized fricatives and a bilabial trill. The four Avava-speaking villages speak or spoke, distinct dialects. Timbembe and Nevaar (Nɨviar) are still spoken. The Nivat (Nevat) and Bangasa (Umbrul) dialects are extinct. Bangasa/Bangsa', or more correctly Bangasak, was known as Numbuwul by its neighbors to the north; the endonym is Umbbuul . ==Phonology== When the final syllable is light (CV), stress tends to be penultimate. When the final syllable is heavy (CVC, CVV, CVː), stress tends to be final. ===Vowels=== There are a total of eight vowel quantities in Avava: five short vowels and three long vowels. The five short Avava vowel qualities, . is pronounced between a bilabial trill and an alveolar and, in final syllables, between a bilabial trill and . About 2% of vowels are long. Long is not attested, and long is marginal. This is a pattern shared with Naman. At the end of a prosodic unit - in citation form, utterance-finally and when speaking slowly - word-final vowels other than tend to be replaced with \\"diphthongs\\" . Word-initial vowels present in citation form tend to be lost when the word is linked to others, e.g. when the subject of a verb or possessed by a pronoun. This is the reason for the alternative form of the name of the language, vava. { class=\\" IPA\\" -align=center ! !! front !! central !! back -align=center  high  i   u -align=center  mid  e   o -align=center  low   a  } A notable variant of the same phoneme shown with short vowels is when /u/ undergoes centralisation to [ʉ] in two different settings: in closed syllables between a bilabial trill and a following alveolar consonant, and . The three long vowels in Avava are /i:/, /u:/, and /a:/. Though there is evidence for the long /o:/, the vowel is only shown in three words throughout the entire lexicon of Avava. ===Consonants=== {class=\\" IPA\\" +Avava consonant inventory - ! labiallabializedcoronaldorsalglottal -align=center !Nasal mmʷnŋ -align=center !Prenasalized stop ᵐbᵐbʷⁿdᵑɡ -align=center !Voiceless stop p(pʷ)tk -align=center !Fricative vvʷs̠[ɣ]h -align=center !Prenasalized trill colspan=2ᵐbʙ⁽ʷ⁾ⁿdʳ  -align=center !Tap   ɾ  -align=center !Approximant  wlj } is post-alveolar.

The paucal pronouns include a small number, greater than two but less than ten. The paucal and plural forms also differ systemically as they differ in the suffixes -dur and -tl. ===Nominalization=== The Avava language utilizes the process of nominalization to create words from pre-existing ones. Verbal nominalization of words involve the addition of the suffix -ian. Examples: ran 'dawn' ran-ian 'dawning' sasar 'teach' sasar-ian 'teaching' In some cases, the nominalized form of a reduplicated verb contains the unreduplicated root. Example: ngarnar 'breathe' ngar-ian 'breath' Another pattern of nominalization involves the addition of the suffix -ian as well as the addition of the first vowel of the word to the beginning of the word to create a noun from a verb. Examples: kan 'eat' a-kan-iar 'food' per 'work' e-per-ian 'job' ===Place of origin=== The prefix, ma-, when added to the name of a place, refers to a person that is from that specified area. Example: Viar 'Viar' Ma-Viar 'people of Viar' ===Possession=== Nouns in Avava can be divided into two categories: directly possessed nouns and indirectly possessed nouns. Directly possessed nouns The following generalizations can be given on the subject of these types of nouns: * most external body parts * many internal organs, though some do not fall under this category * some bodily products (saliva), though many do not fall under this category * many body parts and products associated with these animals * some kin terms (son/daughter) * many parts of trees and plants ==References== *Crowley, Terry (2006).

In the film, Maggie Simpson is enrolled at a new daycare facility where she squares off with the foul- tempered Baby Gerald when she befriends a caterpillar. The short originated with Simpsons producer James L. Brooks, who enlisted long-time veteran of the series David Silverman to direct the film. The picture was written by producers Brooks, Al Jean, David Mirkin, writers Michael Price and Joel H. Cohen, as well as show creator Matt Groening. The film premiered on July 13, 2012, where it was attached to screenings of the 20th Century Fox release Ice Age: Continental Drift. The film is the second Simpsons theatrical release. The short was re-released on February 15, 2013 and played before the film Life of Pi in selected theaters in United States. Reception has been positive, praising the storytelling and animation. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 2013, losing to Paperman. ==Plot== Marge Simpson drops off Maggie at the Ayn Rand School for Tots, where, after going through a security screening, she is classified as being of \\"average intelligence\\", by a machine manufactured by \\"Often-Wrong Technologies\\". A guard then carries her past the \\"Room for Gifted Babies\\" and puts her in the \\"Nothing Special\\" dreary corner. The playtime items are either taken away or eaten by the other babies. A butterfly then makes its way into the room as Maggie's nemesis, Baby Gerald, squashes and kills it on the wall with a mallet and draws a box around it with a crayon. A second butterfly also meets the same fate. Maggie finds a caterpillar and a pop-up book about the life cycle of the butterfly. Realizing that the caterpillar could also meet the fate of the first two butterflies, she tries to protect it from Gerald. The caterpillar later encases itself in a chrysalis and starts to transform. Once the newly formed butterfly emerges, Maggie tries to help it fly out of the window, but Gerald seemingly kills it by shutting the blinds on it as it attempts to pass through. Maggie dramatically mourns as she falls to the floor. Marge then arrives to pick her up, when it is revealed Maggie's scene was only a ruse to cover the truth: she had slipped her hair bow onto the windowsill and wore the butterfly on her forehead in its place. She then sets the butterfly free as Marge drives her home. ==Production== The Simpsons executive producer James L. Brooks conceived the idea of producing a short film based on the series. The origins of The Longest Daycare came about when The Simpsons executive producer James L. Brooks proposed the idea of making a short film and releasing it in cinemas in front of a feature film—similar to how animation film studio Pixar creates shorts to play before their feature films. He wanted the short to be a fun gift for the fans of The Simpsons, and according to the series' showrunner Al Jean, \\"We [the staff] just wanted to do this as a way of saying, 'We appreciate how much people have stayed with the show and watched it for 25 years.'\\" Brooks picked David Silverman, long-time veteran of the series and director of The Simpsons Movie (2007) to oversee the film. Silverman gave credit to Richard Sakai for the idea to produce the film in stereoscopic 3-D. He considered the reasoning for employing 3-D \\"hard to describe,\\" noting that was largely an experiment and its genesis was born out of \\"having fun.\\" The film was directed by David Silverman. The group first gathered in March 2011—consisting of Brooks, Silverman, Al Jean, David Mirkin, writers Joel Cohen and Michael Price, and Simpsons creator Matt Groening via phone—to pitch ideas for a short. Early on, it was decided to keep it entirely silent and employ Maggie as the lead character, and the setting of a daycare was decided upon. Jean wrote the treatment for the film, and Silverman completed an animatic of early story reels in June 2011. By the following February, the team regrouped to structure the story and formulate more ideas. With the help of Brad Ableson, Erick Tran and Ben Lane, the storyboards and animatic for the short were approved and the film entered production. Silverman himself animated two shots present in the final film. Silverman and his crew began animation work on the short in March 2012, completing in May after just under ten weeks of production. He considered his crew \\"very experienced\\", noting that he worked with stereographer Eric Kurland for the 3-D shots. It was animated with The Simpsons usual production pipeline, which involved sending shots to AKOM in South Korea, but with an amplified focus on the 3-D. The team would attempt to complete ten scenes to send to AKOM per week, which would be returned in a cleaned-up form after two weeks. Shots were then composited together at Film Roman out of necessity as the backgrounds relied on the 3-D. Most stereo elements for 3-D were picked out after shots were cleaned up, while others were manipulated in post-production with After Effects. The short was more costly than the average episode of the television show. ==Release== The Longest Daycare was first announced to the public in a title card at the end of the series' twenty-third-season finale \\"Lisa Goes Gaga\\" that aired on May 20, 2012. It was revealed that the short would be shown in theaters in the United States prior to screenings of the film Ice Age: Continental Drift, starting on July 13, 2012. Like The Simpsons, Ice Age: Continental Drift was produced by 20th Century Fox. A teaser trailer for The Longest Daycare, lasting approximately five seconds, was released on July 3, 2012. This was the second time that characters from The Simpsons appeared on the big screen, as The Simpsons Movie was released in 2007. Coincidentally, the trailer for that film was first attached to screenings of the Continental Drift predecessor Ice Age: The Meltdown. A 2D version of the short was displayed by the producers of The Simpsons at the series' panel at San Diego Comic-Con International on July 14, 2012. It had its world television premiere on Network Ten in Australia on February 17, 2013 at 6:25pm, 5 hours before it premiered on Fox in the USA but 16 hours later in real time due to time zone differences, right after The Simpsons episode \\"Hardly Kirk-ing\\". It was also aired in the UK on the same day on Sky 1 at 9:55am, 12 noon and 7:30pm and on Channel 4 at 1:30pm GMT. It also premiered on the same day, at 7:55pm on Prima COOL, in the Czech Republic and on FOX Brasil at 8:30pm. After being nominated for an Academy Award, The Longest Daycare was released along with all the other 15 Oscar-nominated short films in theaters by ShortsHD. The short became available on Disney+ on May 29, 2020. ==Reception== The Longest Daycare has received critical acclaim. Many film critics have said that the short was better than Ice Age: Continental Drift. Claudia Puig of USA Today argued that \\"the brief tale is far more clever and whimsical than any sequence in Ice Age.\\" Similarly, Sun Herald critic Leigh Paatsch said the short \\"displays all the wit and creativity missing from Continental Drift.\\" San Francisco Chronicle writer Amy Biancolli commented that the short is \\"only a few minutes long, but those few minutes boast more imagination, pathos and suspense than the entire film that follows.\\" Joe Williams of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote that while the short takes place in a daycare, it ironically features more \\"artistic maturity\\" than Continental Drift. The Longest Daycare has been praised for being both humorous and emotional. Puig and Biancolli described the short as \\"hilarious\\". Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic stated that the film is \\"terrific—sweet, sad, funny, surprising,\\" and Kristian Lin of Fort Worth Weekly said it is \\"clever\\" and \\"surprisingly moving\\". Writing for Pioneer Press, Chris Hewitt noted that Maggie's interaction with Gerald \\"is hilarious and, ultimately, poignant in an animated film that covers more territory, all without dialogue, than most full-length movies.\\" He went on to call the short a \\"triumph of storytelling, pacing and big-hearted humor.\\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the short a \\"charming 3-D cartoon\\" that is \\"witty and touching and marvelously concise\\". He added that it \\"cleverly blends the bright-colored flatness of the television show with the gimmickry of 3-D. It also upholds (more than the TV series itself) one of the golden rules of animation: no talking.\\" Tim Martain of The Mercury has also described the short as \\"touching\\". The Boston Globes Tom Russo thought the short was \\"a welcome throwback to the days when The Simpsons had more sentiment at its core, and wasn’t so much about the latest batch of newbie Ivy League writers taking their cues from Family Guy.\\" In a joint review of the episode \\"Hardly Kirk-ing\\", Teresa Lopez of TV fanatic said \\"The Longest Daycare was a beautiful piece of animation showcasing a tender story of hope in an otherwise bleak environment.

The parkway consists of the central median landscaped area including the bordering east and west tree lined sidewalks and various sized green spaces which separates opposing lanes of traffic, and roadway intersections. Broad Street itself is a historic city street and this landscaped segment is bordered by an urban residential townhome community and the entrance to the major venues of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex and Xfinity Live!, and the Philadelphia Navy Yard. ==History== In 1904, a plan for a Park and Parkway Improvements in South Philadelphia began with Samuel Parsons Jr. laying out a design, but work stopped by 1910. Then in 1912, the city's director of public works, Morris Cooke, engaged the preeminent landscape architecture firm, Olmsted Brothers, to produce designs for League Island Park, Oregon PlazaThe Olmsted Brothers’ Artificial Nature: South Philadelphia’s League Island (F.D.R) Park and the stretch of south Broad Street from Oregon Avenue south to Pattison Avenue and southward to League Island. The unifying medial green space including the tree lined sidewalks on the east and west connected the two parks developed from river swamp lands that were filled and regraded. In 1926 a second Parkway was constructed on Moyanmensing Avenue from Oregon Avenue to the intersection of Packer Avenue, and Packer Avenue was extended from 20th Street to Broad Street (Southern Boulevard) for access to the Sesquicentennial Exposition. Later the two parks were renamed Marconi Plaza and FDR Park and the median landscaping known as the Southern Boulevard. Olmsted's design was centered on the availability of open space to all residents. Olmsted wanted to create a place that took advantage of the best characteristics that the city and the country had to offer. The intended result was to create a \\"Suburban Village\\" by blending the countryside with the urban environments and developing an organization of open space, views and providing the advantages of increased health benefits of \\"purity of air\\" and \\"facilities for quiet out-of-door recreation\\". This original concept design facilitated surrounding development in the next 100 years of a thriving urban residential community, countryside recreation and the focal location point for regional metropolitan spectator sporting events. The Boulevard was utilized as the main entrance and central roadway in the 1926 Sesquicentennial Exposition, a world's fair hosted in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence, and the 50th anniversary of the 1876 Centennial Exposition. Open green areas, parking, and huge exposition buildings flanked the Boulevard lined with linden trees and flowering crab apple trees, individual obelisks as the 13 columns for each of the original colony States known as the \\"Founders Pylons\\", various standards, banners and a huge 80 foot high 27 ton replica of the Liberty Bell at the gateway of Oregon Plaza. The Boulevard was illuminated at night with spectacular visual displays of the huge Liberty Bell surrounded with 26,000 light bulbs, the Founder Pylons each with a powerful searchlight projecting skyward, and the shooting projection of lights from the Tower Of Light. This provided a fantastic effect for that time period. The structures were demolished or removed following the close of the exposition, but the area continued to draw development in the 1960s with a new stadium, bowling alley, drive in movie theater, movie theater, and a major new Aquarium, Aquarama Aquarium Theater of the Sea. The development pattern continued with the centralized venues for professional sports in the form of Veterans Stadium and Spectrum which also have since been demolished and in 2012 now includes a complex of two Stadiums, one arena, and a new dining and entertainment district. Although the thoroughfare carried the name of Broad Street the green space was officially designated in the 1950s Philadelphia Home Rule City Charter as part of the Fairmount Park urban park system as parkland, to be known as Southern Parkway. No traces of this name exist in this area today and it is merely referred to as part of Broad Street. ==Major intersectionsReferences== Category:Municipal parks in Philadelphia Category:South Philadelphia Category:Streets in Philadelphia Category:Boulevards in the United States Category:World's fair sites in Pennsylvania Category:Parkways in the United States ","title":"Southern Boulevard Parkway"},{"id":"35887825","text":"The 1995-96 EHF Cup Winners' Cup season, TBV Lemgo won the Europe's club handball tournament. ==Knockout stageElimination Round=Round of 32=Round of 16=== } ===Quarterfinals=== } ===Semifinals=== } ===Finals=== } {  style=\\"text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;\\" - !EHF Cup Winners' Cup 1995-96 Winner -  - TBV Lemgo } == References == * Men Handball European Cup Winners Cup 1996 == External links == * EHF Cup Winners' Cup website Category:EHF Cup Winners' Cup seasons Category:1995 in handball Category:1996 in handball ","title":"1995–96 EHF Cup Winners' Cup"},{"id":"35887826","text":"Kanu Bhalala is a Member of Legislative assembly from Visavadar constituency in Gujarat for its 12th legislative assembly ==References== Category:Living people Category:Gujarat MLAs 2007–2012 Category:Bharatiya Janata Party politicians from Gujarat Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Kanu Bhalala"},{"id":"35887840","text":"Lavajibhai Rajani is a Member of Legislative assembly from Maliya constituency in Gujarat for its 12th legislative assembly. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Bharatiya Janata Party politicians from Gujarat Category:Gujarat MLAs 2007–2012 Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Lavajibhai Rajani"},{"id":"35887846","text":"Mahendra Mashru is an Indian politician from Gujarat.

It is found buried in the sediment on the sea bed in shallow parts of the eastern Atlantic Ocean. It is harvested for human consumption in Spain and other parts of Western Europe. ==Description== Empty valves The pullet carpet shell has a pair of hinged, oblong valves that grow to about in length. The umbone/beak is about one third of the way along the shell. The anterior part of the hinge forms an angle with the posterior part and there are 3 cardinal teeth on each valve. The shell is sculptured on the outside with fine radial ribs running from the umbone to the margin and with fine concentric striations. The colour is cream, grey or pale brown, sometimes with irregular streaks or rays of darker colour. The inside of the shell is glossy white, sometimes with purple markings near the umbone. The adductor muscle scars and the pallial line are clearly visible and there is a large, rounded pallial sinus. The siphons are joined for their full length, a fact that distinguishes this species from the otherwise similar Ruditapes decussatus. ==Distribution and habitat== This species is found in shallow waters in the East Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. The clam's range extends from the coasts of Norway south to West Africa. It lives in a shallow burrow just under the surface in sand, mud or gravel. It occurs in the intertidal zone down to about . ==Biology== This bivalve extends its siphons to the surface of the sediment in which it is buried, and draws in water through one of them and expels it through the other. While the water is passing through the gills, phytoplankton and other organic food particles are filtered out. Individuals clams are either male or female, and breeding takes place mostly in summer by the liberation of gametes into the water. The resulting larvae drift with the currents as part of the plankton for about two weeks before settling on the seabed, undergoing metamorphosis and becoming juveniles known as \\"spat\\". ==Fishery== The pullet carpet shell is cultivated in Spain, Portugal, France and Italy for human consumption. The clam fishing industry in Spain grew rapidly in 1926 and 1927 with clams of all sizes being dug out of the sands indiscriminately. By 1956, 250 boats were involved in the industry near San Simon in Galicia. In subsequent years, over-harvesting caused a drop in natural populations. Currently farmers in the area have \\"parks\\", areas of the seabed that they cultivate and maintain. Hatcheries rear larvae and the resulting spat is grown on in nurseries. The small clams are then seeded onto the seabed, where the animals quickly bury themselves. Maintenance consists of removing seaweed, restricting predation by crabs and starfish, and ensuring that the sediment is sufficiently oxygenated. Harvesting is done 12 to 28 months after seeding, using specially designed shovels and rakes. ==References== Category:Veneridae Category:Bivalves described in 1791 ","title":"Venerupis corrugata"},{"id":"35888070","text":"This is a list of Iranian football transfers for the 2011 summer transfer window.

Macfarlan gave two reasons for his resignation from the UAP: that the party was sitting in opposition to the Dunstan Country government which he praised; and that it was controlled by a central body outside of the parliament, the members of which were unknown to most party members. Frederick Holden (Grant) also left the UAP and sat on the cross benches. This reduced the UAP's numbers from 21 to 19. * Ernie Bond (Port Fairy and Glenelg) had been expelled from the Labor Party (ALP) over his support for the \\"Premiers' Plan\\" in 1932, and had won several elections as an independent. He was re-admitted to the ALP in on 16 April 1938. This increased the ALP's numbers from 20 to 21. * On 5 November 1938, the United Country Party (UCP) won a by-election in the seat of Gippsland North, after the death of the sitting member James Weir McLachlan, an independent. This reduced the number of Independents to 3, and increased the numbers for the UCP from 20 to 21. * In August 1939, Alfred Kirton (Mornington) resigned from the UAP and sat briefly as an independent, before joining the United Country Party on 29 August 1939. This reduced the UAP from 19 seats to 18, and increased the UCP seats from 21 to 22. * In 1939 Frederick Cook (Benalla) moved from being an Independent to joining the Liberal Country Party, a breakaway group from the Country Party who supported the federal party's participation in a Coalition government. ==ResultsLegislative Assembly=== } ==See also== *Candidates of the Victorian state election, 1940 *1940 Victorian Legislative Council election ==References== Category:1940 elections in Australia Category:Elections in Victoria (Australia) Category:1940s in Victoria (Australia) Category:March 1940 events ","title":"1940 Victorian state election"},{"id":"35888155","text":"Théophile Rudolphe Studer Théophile Rudolphe Studer (27 November 1845 – 12 February 1922) was a Swiss ornithologist and marine biologist.

He retired from parliament in 1933, and the same year was appointed chairman of the Betting Control Board, holding the post until 1939. He continued as a member of the BCB until December 1953, when failing health forced his resignation.

By 2002 the production and talent management divisions had separated; the production division is now known as Sidus Pictures while the talent management division became iHQ (also known as SidusHQ). In 2005 iHQ acquired YTN Group's cable TV broadcasting division (YTN Media), and changed its name to present-day CU Media. It expanded into China, opening an office in Beijing in partnership with SK Telecom China in 2007. The branch serves to promote the activities of Korean stars in the Chinese market.

The church was designated as a municipal heritage building on September 13, 1983. The brick building contains two towers and is of a Romanesque Revival style while the interior exhibits a Classical Revival influence. The Assumption Church is 12.8 km north (8 miles) of Humboldt, Saskatchewan on Hwy 20 and 3.2 km (2 miles) east on Marysburg Grid 756. The church can hold over 400 people and makes extensive use of stained glass. The interior is decorated with works by the artist Berthold Imhoff. Thirty two Imhoff paintings were purchased in 1948. ==Restoration== Assumption Church Restoration Committee was formed in 1998, when the parish had shrunk to 25 families. These families, as well as a great many Marysburg expatriates, were very fond of their fine church and decided to undertake the huge task of restoration From 1998 to the end of 2003, new furnaces were installed, the foundation repaired, the brick exterior repaired, insulation pumped between roof and ceiling, and both nave and side wings given new roofs. This was financed entirely by local initiative. 2004 saw the start of major renovations to the interior. Mike Labelle of Western Restoration was hired and as a result the interior of the church was replastered and painted. Paintings by Berhold Imhoff were cleaned, repaired and remounted on the walls of the church in the winter of 2006. New Tiles Being Installed New roof tiles Work continues on the stained-glass windows and wood floors. As the restoration of this church continues fundraising events and donations from individuals and companies across Canada have contributed greatly to this cause. An annual publication of the newspaper The Marysburg Town Crier is sent out every November to all former residents of the Marysburg area. This paper helps our restoration committee to report our achievements and update and advertise upcoming events pertaining to our restoration efforts. The Assumption Church Restoration Committee received the Saskatchewan Architectural Heritage Award in September 2009 in the category of long-term stewardship. ==Church use== The Assumption church, still an integral part of a functioning parish community, is also being utilized as a venue to showcase talent of local, regional and national performing and visual arts. The use of the church's superb Steinway grand piano as well as Yamaha organ is available at any event in the church, be it Wedding, Baptism, Funeral, Concert, Recital. The church, with its second level balcony (choir loft) seats over 400 people. With its extensive grounds, separate hall (complete with full kitchen) next door, the grandeur of the church continues to draw many former Marysburgers back home for family reunions and other community events. Camping (40 non-serviced lots) available on site, makes all planning for a major event much easier. ==References== Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1920 Category:Roman Catholic churches in Saskatchewan Category:Humboldt No. 370, Saskatchewan ","title":"Marysburg Assumption Church"},{"id":"35888301","text":"Adela septentrionella is a moth of the family Adelidae or fairy longhorn moths.

He studied piano under Pierre Sancan, as well as Harmony (Alain Bernaud), Counterpoint (Jean-Paul Holstein), Fugue (Michel Merlet), and Orchestration (Serge Nigg) at the Conservatoire de Paris, from 1979 to 1984, in addition to studying the Organ with Jean Galard through the Ville de Paris. Delplace began to compose in the mid-1980s, with a firm conviction, though unpopular at the time, that tonal music still hides infinite unexplored territories. Never parting from this ideal, his music finds its roots in that of Bach, Brahms, Fauré, Ravel, Prokofiev... This determination to write tonal music has naturally kept him far from official contemporary music circles. In 2000, he joined the Phoenix Group founded by Jean-François Zygel and Thierry Escaich, in order to propose an alternative to institutionalized contemporary music. Having explored many different types of ensembles, from orchestra to choir, from chamber music to the organ, he dedicates a large part of his opus to the piano, often played by many prestigious performers. From 2008, he began to perform his own works in concert. His works are played mostly in France, but also in Germany, Italy, Greece, Turkey, China, the United States...

Active in the Kyabram Reform Movement, he was a founder of the Victorian Farmers' Union (VFU) in 1916 and served as its general secretary from 1916 to 1918. In 1917 he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as the member for Kara Kara, but he was defeated on a recount in February 1918. He was subsequently the VFU's candidate for the 1918 federal Flinders by-election, but withdrew after extracting a promise from the Nationalist Party to introduce preferential voting. Despite several attempts, Hall never re-entered parliament. He remained a journalist, editing the Farmer's Advocate (1917-24), the Morning Post (1924-27) and the Leader (1946-49).

The Pocket Theatre production closed on May 5, 1968, after 634 performances. ===Australia=== The show was performed in Australia by the New Theatre in Sydney in 1968, causing police action to be taken against the acting company. After 13 performances, Motel, in which two big dolls scrawl obscenities on the walls of a motel room, was banned on moral grounds by the New South Wales Chief Secretary. While the production continued, with the banned segment replaced by a satire about the ban, a committee called ‘Friends of America Hurrah’ prepared plans for a one-night performance of the original version. This played to a full house in the Teachers Federation auditorium while thousands of people waited outside on Sussex Street, hoping to get in. Audience excitement was high at the end of Motel, when police attempted to arrest the two heavily disguised dolls in the cast as they ran for the auditorium door. The actors appeared to vanish, but protected by fellow cast members, they actually shed their costumes and returned to mingle with other cast members who were trying to stop the police from tearing apart the set to take as evidence. There were no prosecutions, and the confiscated pieces of the set were eventually returned. The cast at the New Theatre in Sydney included Maggie Kirkpatrick, John Hargreaves, and Carole Skinner. ==Publication== America Hurrah was first published by Coward-McCann in the United States and by Penguin Books in Great Britain.

However, they are modified to allow reactant addition and/or product removal in time. A normal batch reactor is filled with reactants in a single stirred tank at time t=0 and the reaction proceeds. A semibatch reactor, however, allows partial filling of reactants with the flexibility of adding more as time progresses. Stirring in both types is very efficient, which allows batch and semibatch reactors to assume a uniform composition and temperature throughout. == Advantages == The flexibility of adding more reactants over time through semibatch operation has several advantages over a batch reactor. These include: ===Improved selectivity of a reaction=== Sometimes a particular reactant can go through parallel paths that yield two different products, only one of which is desired. Consider the simple example below: A→U (desired product) A→W (undesired product) The rate expressions, considering the variability of the volume of reaction, are: V \\\\frac{dC_A}{dt} + C_V \\\\frac{dV}{dt} = F_A \\\\- k_1 C_A^\\\\alpha V \\\\frac{dC_U}{dt} + C_V \\\\frac{dV}{dt} = k_1 C_A^\\\\alpha \\\\- F_U V \\\\frac{dC_W}{dt} + C_W \\\\frac{dV}{dt} = k_2 C_A^\\\\beta \\\\- F_W Where F_A is the molar rate of addition of the reactant A. Note that the presence of these addition terms, which could be negative in case of products removal (e.g. by fractional distillation) are the ones marking the difference of the semi batch reactor cases from the simpler batch cases. For standard batch reactors (no addition terms) the selectivity of the desired product is defined as: S = \\\\frac{d(VC_U)}{d(VC_W)} = \\\\frac{k_1}{k_2}C_A^{\\\\alpha-\\\\beta} S = \\\\frac{dC_U}{dC_W} = \\\\frac{k_1}{k_2}C_A^{\\\\alpha-\\\\beta} for constant volume (i.e. batch) reactions. If \\\\beta > \\\\alpha, the concentration of the reactant should be kept at a low level in order to maximize selectivity. This can be accomplished using a semibatch reactor. ===Better control of exothermic reactions=== Exothermic reactions release heat, and ones that are highly exothermic can cause safety concerns. Semibatch reactors allow for slow addition of reactants in order to control the heat released and thus, temperature, in the reactor. ===Product removal through a purge stream=== In order to minimize the reversibility of a reaction one must minimize the concentration of the product. This can be done in a semibatch reactor by using a purge stream to remove products and increase the net reaction rate by favoring the forward reaction. ==Reactor choice== It is important to understand that these advantages are more applicable to the decision between using a batch, a semibatch or a continuous reactor in a certain process. Both batch and semibatch reactors are more suitable for liquid phase reactions and small scale production, because they usually require lower capital costs than a continuously stirred tank reactor operation (CSTR), but incur greater costs per unit if production needs to be scaled up. These per unit costs include labor, materials handling (filling, emptying, cleaning), protective measures, and nonproductive periods that result from changeovers when switching batches. Hence, the capital costs must be weighed against operating costs to determine the correct reactor design to be implemented. ==ReferencesSources== * Hill, C. (1937).

Established in 1784, they are the oldest city park in Milan. After their establishment, the Gardens have been repeatedly enlarged (to the current overall area of 172.000 m2) and enriched with notable buildings, most notably the Natural History Museum (1888–1893) and the Planetarium (1930). ==History== Video of Milan's zoo shot in the seventies. In the second half of the 18th Century, the area of the Public Gardens was owned by the Dugnani family and was mostly cultivated land; a number of canals irrigated the area that were later closed. The area also included the buildings of two former monasteries (the San Dionigi and the Carcanine monasteries) which had ceased activity under Austrian rule. In 1780, Ferdinand, Duke of Breisgau, who was viceroy of Milan in 1771-1796, assigned architect Giuseppe Piermarini at the renewal of the area and the establishment of a city park. The works were completed between 1782 and 1786, and largely employed prisoners serving a life sentence as manpower. Piermarini's design was largely influenced by French formal gardens, with geometric flower beds and large tree-lined pathways arranged in such a way to create pleasant perspective effects. At the north-eastern corner, an area was dedicated to the game of soccer. In 1856-1862 landscape architect Giuseppe Balzaretto designed the enlargement of the west side of the Gardens based on the English landscape park model with artificial hills, rooks, and lakes. These works were concluded after the Unification of Italy. In the 19th Century the Natural History Museum was established, along with other \\"animal attractions\\" such as aviaries and exhibits with deer, monkeys and a giraffe; this would later evolve in Milan's Zoo (which was dismantled in 1992). Some of the zoo's most popular animals have been stuffed and are exposed in the Natural History Museum; a few structures from the zoo (such as the pavilion that housed the big cats cages) have remained. ==Monuments== Several monuments and tourist attractions are enclosed within the park. Notable buildings include the Ulrico Hoepli Planetarium (designed by architect Pietro Portalupi in 1929), the Natural History Museum (1892, Giovanni Cerutti), the 17th Century Palazzo Dugnani, and the eclectic Padiglione del Caffé by architect Giuseppe De Finetti. A statue of Indro Montanelli has been established in 2002, when the park was renamed after the popular journalist and writer, who was known to relax in the park every morning before entering the nearby offices of his newspaper, Il Giornale. Montanelli was also shot in his legs by the terrorist group Brigate Rosse on June 2, 1977; his statue has been placed close to the spot where this happened. ==See also== * Milan's Zoo ==References * Montanelli Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Tourist attractions in Milan ","title":"Giardini Pubblici Indro Montanelli"},{"id":"35888655","text":"The Trippenhuis Kloveniersburgwal is an Amsterdam canal flowing south from Nieuwmarkt to the Amstel River on the edge of the medieval city, lying east of the dam in the centre of Amsterdam. ==History== The Kloveniersburgwal was dug at the end of the 15th century. The Geldersekade, the Singel and the Kloveniersburgwal together formed the city wall around the city. After the Nieuwe Gracht (Oude Schans now) was dug and the new city walls were built, Kloveniersburgwal lost its function as a defense canal. The old city wall was taken down and they built houses on it instead. The east side became populated in the 17th century and has a few grand mansions, like the Trippenhuis, now housing the KNAW. The name 'Kloveniersburgwal' comes from a division of the civic guards, the 'kloveniers', named after the gun the guards were armed with. The kloveniers met at the 'Kloveniersdoelen' next to Swijgh Utrecht on the corner of the Kloveniersburgwal and the Nieuwe Doelenstraat. Later on their groupportrait, the famous painting De Nachtwacht (by Rembrandt), hung in the 'Kloveniersdoelen'. Nowadays, it is exhibited in the Rijksmuseum.

It shows the college life of students, their hostel life, the way they enjoy themselves in the college and the hard work they put in for their studies. Fellow students of Punjab University, Navdeep Singh (Jimmy Sheirgill) and Harman Kaur (Juhi Babbar), fall in love with each other. Both start to dream of a happy life together. But problems arise when they think of taking their parent's consent before going any further. Harman's father Col. Thakur Singh (Anupam Kher) is a typical Punjabi father with a big ego who does not appreciate the idea of his daughter selecting a groom herself. Deep's Father, Retired Major Balwinder Singh Brar (Raj Babbar), also opposes this alliance, and wants his son to complete his studies before getting married. Balwinder subsequently changes his mind but wants Thakur to adapt to tradition and approach him – but Thakur refuses to do so. The couple then conspire with their fellow students and arrange for their parents to meet on neutral ground. It is this decision that will shatter and change their lives forever. Now both Navdeep and Harmaan are in a dilemma: neither can they go against their parents, nor can they live without each other.

The ceremony is carried out every year on 22 May since 1990 to mark the unification of North Yemen and South Yemen as the Republic of Yemen. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) affiliate Ansar al-Sharia. == Background == The suicide bombing came 10 days into an army offensive against al-Qaeda in Yemen's restive southern Abyan province, where the AQAP (Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula) have seized control of a string of towns and cities in attacks launched since May 2011. According to witnesses and Yemeni officials, the Yemeni government had intensified its offensive against Al Qaeda in southern Yemen in the week prior to the attack with combined air and ground assaults leaving dozens of casualties, among them civilians. It also follows suspected U.S. drone bombings in Yemen, which AQAP said the attack was in retaliation for and, at the same time, AQAP have used instability over the 2011-2012 Yemeni uprising to take control of swathes of southern Yemen. == Attack == The attack took place in al-Sabin Square, near Yemen's presidential palace, as soldiers were arranging themselves in a parade rehearsal for the upcoming Unity Day ceremonies. According to Yemeni security officials, the bomber was a rogue soldier participating in the drill wearing a belt of explosives. Early reports suggested a few dozen casualties, but by the early afternoon the confirmed death toll was at 90, with at least 222 injured. Security officials stated that the attacker had detonated his explosives shortly before Defence Minister Muhammad Nasir Ahmad Ali and the army chief-of-staff were expected to greet the troops. The attack resulted in \\"horrific carnage\\", with one witness describing \\"arms and legs scattered on the ground ... The wounded people were piled on top of each other, covered with blood.\\" Another soldier who had been present for the attack called it a \\"massacre\\", stating \\"I have never seen such a bloody day in my life\\". Al-Arabiya reported on 96 dead and over 300 injured in the blast. Later in the day the casualty toll was raised yet again, this time to over 120 killed and nearly 350 injured, some of them critically. A doctor at a Sana'a hospital described the city's medical facilities as overwhelmed, and stated that the attack had left dozens paralyzed. Most of the casualties appeared to be from the Central Security Organisation – a large paramilitary force commanded by Yahya Saleh, a nephew of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Within hours of the attack, Saleh was dismissed from his post by presidential decree. == Perpetrators == Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's-affiliate Ansar al-Sharia claimed responsibility for the attack a few hours after it had taken place. A spokesman for the group said it was in retaliation for injustices done by the CSO: \\"We will take revenge, God willing, and the flames of war will reach you everywhere, and what happened is but the start of a jihad project in defence of honour and sanctities.\\" It also added that there would be more attacks if the government assault did not stop in Abyan. == Reactions == President Abdrabu Mansur Hadi stated that the attackers \\"wanted to turn the joy of our people with the unity day into sorrow ... and therefore, the war on terrorism will continue till it is uprooted and defeated completely whatever the sacrifices are\\". State-run Saba News Agency condemned the bombing as a terrorist attack, showing \\"a moral and religious perversion of the attackers and plotters\\". United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attack and called for those involved to be brought to justice. He also urged the people of Yemen to fully implement the negotiated political transition that had replaced the administration of President Saleh with that of Hadi following the 2011–2012 Yemeni revolution. The U.K. Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt strongly condemned the attack, calling it 'cowardly'. He added that \\"this tragic event underlines the scale of the security challenge facing the Yemeni government as it seeks to introduce key reforms and work towards completing political transition\\". The White House issued a statement as well, condemning the bombing and offering to help Yemen with the investigation. US President Barack Obama also expressed concerns that Yemen was becoming a \\"hub\\" for terrorism. French President François Hollande described the attack as \\"barbaric\\". The Somali Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab congratulated Al-Qaeda on the successful attack through its official Twitter account. == Aftermath == The Unity Day parade was held on schedule the following day, with President Hadi watching from behind a bulletproof barrier. On 24 May, a suicide bomber killed 12 people when he drove his car into a crowd supporting Shi'ite rebels, who Al Qaeda considers \\"renegade Muslims\\". Another suicide bomber attempted to attack a protest on the same day, but his belt killed only himself. == References == Category:2012 murders in Yemen Category:Explosions in 2012 Sana'a Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2012 Category:Terrorist incidents in Yemen in 2012 Category:21st century in Sana'a Category:Suicide bombings in Yemen Category:Terrorist incidents attributed to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula Category:Crime in Sana'a Category:May 2012 events in Asia ","title":"2012 Sanaa bombing"},{"id":"35888791","text":"Mordellistena multistrigosa is a species of beetle in the genus Mordellistena of the family Mordellidae, which is part of the superfamily Tenebrionoidea.

It was part of the wider European Romantic movement, which was partly a reaction against the Age of Enlightenment, emphasising individual, national and emotional responses, moving beyond Renaissance and Classicist models, particularly to the Middle Ages. In the arts, Romanticism manifested itself in literature and drama in the adoption of the mythical bard Ossian, the exploration of national poetry in the work of Robert Burns and in the historical novels of Walter Scott. Scott also had a major impact on the development of a national Scottish drama. Art was heavily influenced by Ossian and a new view of the Highlands as the location of a wild and dramatic landscape. Scott profoundly affected architecture through his re-building of Abbotsford House in the early nineteenth century, which set off the boom in the Scots Baronial revival. In music, Burns was part of an attempt to produce a canon of Scottish song, which resulted in a cross fertilisation of Scottish and continental classical music, with romantic music becoming dominant in Scotland into the twentieth century. Intellectually, Scott and figures like Thomas Carlyle played a part in the development of historiography and the idea of the historical imagination. Romanticism also influenced science, particularly the life sciences, geology, optics and astronomy, giving Scotland a prominence in these areas that continued into the late nineteenth century. Scottish philosophy was dominated by Scottish Common Sense Realism, which shared some characteristics with Romanticism and was a major influence on the development of Transcendentalism. Scott also played a major part in defining Scottish and British politics, helping to create a romanticised view of Scotland and the Highlands that fundamentally changed Scottish national identity. Romanticism began to subside as a movement in the 1830s, but it continued to significantly affect areas such as music until the early twentieth century. It also had a lasting impact on the nature of Scottish identity and outside perceptions of Scotland. ==Definitions== Romanticism was a complex artistic, literary and intellectual movement that originated in the second half of the eighteenth century in western Europe, and gained strength during and after the Industrial and French Revolutions.A. Chandler, A Dream of Order: the Medieval Ideal in Nineteenth-Century English Literature (London: Taylor & Francis, 1971), p. 4. It was partly a revolt against the political norms of the Age of Enlightenment which rationalised nature, and was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but significantly influenced historiography,David Levin, History as Romantic Art: Bancroft, Prescott, and Parkman (1967). philosophyS. Swift, Romanticism, Literature And Philosophy: Expressive Rationality in Rousseau, Kant, Wollstonecraft And Contemporary Theory (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006), . and the natural sciences.Ashton Nichols, \\"Roaring Alligators and Burning Tygers: Poetry and Science from William Bartram to Charles Darwin,\\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 2005 149(3): 304–315 Romanticism has been seen as \\"the revival of the life and thought of the Middle Ages\\", reaching beyond Rationalist and Classicist models to elevate medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived to be authentically medieval, in an attempt to escape the confines of population growth, urban sprawl and industrialism, embracing the exotic, unfamiliar and distant.R. R. Agrawal, The Medieval Revival and its Influence on the Romantic Movement (Abhinav, 1990), p. 1. It is also associated with political revolutions, beginning with those in Americana and France and movements for independence, particularly in Poland, Spain and Greece. It is often thought to incorporate an emotional assertion of the self and of individual experience along with a sense of the infinite, transcendental and sublime. In art there was a stress on imagination, landscape and a spiritual correspondence with nature. It has been described by Margaret Drabble as \\"an unending revolt against classical form, conservative morality, authoritarian government, personal insincerity, and human moderation\\". ==Literature and drama== Robert Burns in Alexander Nasmyth's portrait of 1787 Although after union with England in 1707 Scotland increasingly adopted English language and wider cultural norms, its literature developed a distinct national identity and began to enjoy an international reputation. Allan Ramsay (1686–1758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the Habbie stanza as a poetic form.J. Buchan, Crowded with Genius (London: Harper Collins, 2003), , p. 311. James Macpherson (1736–96) was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation. Claiming to have found poetry written by the ancient bard Ossian, he published translations that acquired international popularity, being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics. Fingal, written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its appreciation of natural beauty and treatment of the ancient legend has been credited more than any single work with bringing about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, through its influence on Johann Gottfried von Herder and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.J. Buchan, Crowded with Genius (London: Harper Collins, 2003), , p. 163. It was also popularised in France by figures that included Napoleon.H. Gaskill, The Reception of Ossian in Europe (Continuum, 2004), , p. 140. Eventually it became clear that the poems were not direct translations from the Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of his audience.D. Thomson, The Gaelic Sources of Macpherson's \\"Ossian\\" (Aberdeen: Oliver & Boyd, 1952). Robert Burns (1759–96) and Walter Scott (1771–1832) were highly influenced by the Ossian cycle. Burns, an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland and a major influence on the Romantic movement. His poem (and song) \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" is often sung at Hogmanay (the last day of the year), and \\"Scots Wha Hae\\" served for a long time as an unofficial national anthem of the country.L. McIlvanney, \\"Hugh Blair, Robert Burns, and the Invention of Scottish Literature\\", Eighteenth- Century Life, vol. 29 (2), Spring 2005, pp. 25–46. Scott began as a poet and also collected and published Scottish ballads. His first prose work, Waverley in 1814, is often called the first historical novel.K. S. Whetter, Understanding Genre and Medieval Romance (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008), , p. 28. It launched a highly successful career, with other historical novels such as Rob Roy (1817), The Heart of Midlothian (1818) and Ivanhoe (1820). Scott probably did more than any other figure to define and popularise Scottish cultural identity in the nineteenth century.N. Davidson, The Origins of Scottish Nationhood (Pluto Press, 2008), , p. 136. Other major literary figures connected with Romanticism include the poets and novelists James Hogg (1770–1835), Allan Cunningham (1784–1842) and John Galt (1779–1839).A. Maunder, FOF Companion to the British Short Story (Infobase Publishing, 2007), , p. 374. One of the most significant figures of the Romantic movement, Lord Byron, was brought up in Scotland until he acquired his English title.P. MacKay, E. Longley and F. Brearton, Modern Irish and Scottish Poetry (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), , p. 59. Scotland was also the location of two of the most important literary magazines of the era, The Edinburgh Review (founded in 1802) and Blackwood's Magazine (founded in 1817), which significantly influenced the development of British literature and drama in the era of Romanticism.A. Jarrels, \\"'Associations respect[ing] the past': Enlightenment and Romantic historicism\\", in J. P. Klancher, A Concise Companion to the Romantic Age (Oxford: John Wiley & Sons, 2009), , p. 60.A. Benchimol, ed., Intellectual Politics and Cultural Conflict in the Romantic Period: Scottish Whigs, English Radicals and the Making of the British Public Sphere (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2010), , p. 210. Ian Duncan and Alex Benchimol suggest that publications like the novels of Scott and these magazines were part of a highly dynamic Scottish Romanticism that by the early nineteenth century, caused Edinburgh to emerge as the cultural capital of Britain and become central to a wider formation of a \\"British Isles nationalism.\\"A. Benchimol, ed., Intellectual Politics and Cultural Conflict in the Romantic Period: Scottish Whigs, English Radicals and the Making of the British Public Sphere (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2010), , p. 209. The Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, as it was from 1769–1830 Scottish \\"national drama\\" emerged in the early 1800s, as plays with specifically Scottish themes began to dominate the Scottish stage. Theatres had been discouraged by the Church of Scotland and fears of Jacobite assemblies. In the later eighteenth century, many plays were written for and performed by small amateur companies and were not published and so most have been lost. Towards the end of the century there were \\"closet dramas\\", primarily designed to be read, rather than performed, including work by Scott, Hogg, Galt and Joanna Baillie (1762–1851), often influenced by the ballad tradition and Gothic Romanticism.I. Brown, The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: Enlightenment, Britain and Empire (1707–1918) (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 229–30. The Scottish national drama that emerged in the early nineteenth century was largely historical in nature and based around a core of adaptations of Scott's Waverley novels. The existing repertoire of Scottish-themed plays included Shakespeare's Macbeth (c. 1605), Friedrich Schiller's Maria Stuart (1800), John Home's Douglas (1756) and Ramsay's The Gentle Shepherd (1725), with the last two being the most popular plays among amateur groups. Ballets with Scottish themes included Jockey and Jenny and Love in the Highlands.I. Brown, The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: Enlightenment, Britain and Empire (1707–1918) (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 231. Scott was keenly interested in drama, becoming a shareholder in the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh. Baillie's Highland themed Family Legend was first produced in Edinburgh in 1810 with the help of Scott, as part of a deliberate attempt to stimulate a national Scottish drama.M. O'Halloran, \\"National Discourse or Discord? Transformations of The Family Legend by Baille, Scott and Hogg\\", in S-R. Alker and H. F. Nelson, eds, James Hogg and the Literary Marketplace: Scottish Romanticism and the Working-Class Author (Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2009), , p. 43. Scott also wrote five plays, of which Hallidon Hill (1822) and MacDuff's Cross (1822) were patriotic Scottish histories.I. Brown, The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: Enlightenment, Britain and Empire (1707–1918) (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 185–6. Adaptations of the Waverley novels, first performed primarily in minor theatres, rather than the larger Patent theatres, included The Lady in the Lake (1817), The Heart of Midlothian (1819) (specifically described as a \\"romantic play\\" for its first performance), and Rob Roy, which underwent over 1,000 performances in Scotland in this period. Also adapted for the stage were Guy Mannering, The Bride of Lammermoor and The Abbot. These highly popular plays saw the social range and size of the audience for theatre expand and helped shape theatre-going practices in Scotland for the rest of the century. ==Art== Jacob More's The Falls of Clyde: Corra Linn, c. 1771 The Ossian cycle itself became a common subject for Scottish artists, and works based on its themes were created by figures such as Alexander Runciman (1736–85) and David Allan (1744–96).I. Chilvers, ed., The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists (Oxford: Oxford University Press, fourth edn., 2009), , p. 554.The Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2003), , pp. 34–5. This period saw a shift in attitudes to the Highlands and mountain landscapes in general, from viewing them as hostile, empty regions occupied by backward and marginal people, to interpreting them as aesthetically pleasing exemplars of nature, occupied by rugged primitives, who were now depicted in a dramatic fashion.C. W. J. Withers, Geography, Science and National Identity: Scotland Since 1520 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), , pp. 151–3. Produced before his departure to Italy, Jacob More's (1740–93) series of four paintings \\"Falls of Clyde\\" (1771–73) have been described by art historian Duncan Macmillan as treating the waterfalls as \\"a kind of natural national monument\\" and has been seen as an early work in developing a romantic sensibility to the Scottish landscape. Runciman was probably the first artist to paint Scottish landscapes in watercolours in the more romantic style that was emerging towards the end of the eighteenth century.E. K. Waterhouse, Painting in Britain, 1530 to 1790 (Yale University Press, fifth edn., 1994), , p. 293. The effect of Romanticism can also be seen in the works of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century artists such as Henry Raeburn (1756–1823), Alexander Nasmyth (1758–1840) and John Knox (1778–1845). Raeburn was the most significant artist of the period to pursue his entire career in Scotland. He was born in Edinburgh and returned there after a trip to Italy in 1786. He is most famous for his intimate portraits of leading figures in Scottish life, going beyond the aristocracy to lawyers, doctors, professors, writers and ministers, adding elements of Romanticism to the tradition of Reynolds.C. C. Ochterbeck', ed., Michelin Green Guide: Great Britain Edition (Michelin, 5th edn., 2007), , p. 84. He became a knight in 1822 and the King's limner and painter for Scotland in 1823.D. Campbell, Edinburgh: A Cultural and Literary History (Signal Books, 2003), , pp. 142–3. Nasmyth visited Italy and worked in London, but returned to his native Edinburgh for most of his career. He produced work in a range of forms, including his portrait of Romantic poet Robert Burns, which depicts him against a dramatic Scottish background, but he is chiefly remembered for his landscapes and has been seen as \\"the founder of the Scottish landscape tradition\\".I. Chilvers, ed., The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists (Oxford: Oxford University Press, fourth edn., 2009), , p. 433. The work of Knox continued the theme of landscape, directly linking it with the Romantic works of Scott,R. J. Hill, Picturing Scotland Through the Waverley Novels: Walter Scott and the Origins of the Victorian Illustrated Novel (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2010), , p. 104. and he was also among the first artists to depict the urban landscape of Glasgow.D. Kemp, The Pleasures and Treasures of Britain: A Discerning Traveller's Companion (Dundurn, 1992), , p. 401. ==Architecture== The Gothic revival in architecture has been seen as an expression of Romanticism, and according to Alvin Jackson, the Scots baronial style was \\"a Caledonian reading of the gothic\\".A. Jackson, The Two Unions: Ireland, Scotland, and the Survival of the United Kingdom, 1707–2007 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), , p. 152. Some of the earliest evidence of a revival in Gothic architecture are from Scotland. Inveraray Castle, constructed from 1746 with design input from William Adam, incorporates turrets into a conventional Palladian-style house. His son Robert Adam's houses in this style include Mellerstain and Wedderburn in Berwickshire and Seton House in East Lothian. The trend is most clearly seen at Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, remodelled by Robert from 1777.I. D. Whyte and K. A. Whyte, The Changing Scottish Landscape, 1500–1800 (London: Taylor & Francis, 1991), , p. 100. Abbotsford House, re-built for Walter Scott, helped to launch the Scots Baronial revival. Important for the re-adoption of the Scots Baronial in the early nineteenth century was Abbotsford House, the residence of Scott. Re- built for him from 1816, it became a model for the revival of the style. Common features borrowed from sixteenth- and seventeenth-century houses included battlemented gateways, crow-stepped gables, pointed turrets and machicolations. The style was popular across Scotland and was applied to many relatively modest dwellings by architects such as William Burn (1789–1870), David Bryce (1803–1876),L. Hull, Britain's Medieval Castles (London: Greenwood, 2006), , p. 154. Edward Blore (1787–1879), Edward Calvert (c. 1847–1914) and Robert Stodart Lorimer (1864–1929). Examples in urban contexts include the building of Cockburn Street in Edinburgh (from the 1850s) as well as the National Wallace Monument at Stirling (1859–69).M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: from the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , pp. 276–85. The rebuilding of Balmoral Castle as a baronial palace, and its adoption as a royal retreat by Queen Victoria from 1855–58, confirmed the popularity of the style.Henry-Russell Hitchcock, Architecture: Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries (Yale University Press, fourth edn., 1989), , p. 146. In ecclesiastical architecture, a style similar to that developed in England was adopted. Important figures in this movement included Frederick Thomas Pilkington (1832–98), who developed a new style of church building which accorded with the fashionable High Gothic, but which adapted it for the worship needs of the Free Church of Scotland. Examples include Barclay Viewforth Church, Edinburgh (1862–64).G. Stamp, \\"The Victorian kirk: Presbyterian architecture in nineteenth century Scotland\\", in C. Brooks, ed., The Victorian Church: Architecture and Society (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1995), , pp. 108–10. Robert Rowand Anderson (1834–1921), who trained in the office of George Gilbert Scott in London before returning to Edinburgh, worked mainly on small churches in the \\"First Pointed\\" (or Early English) style that is characteristic of Scott's former assistants. By 1880, his practice was designing some of the most prestigious public and private buildings in Scotland, such as the Scottish National Portrait Gallery; the Dome of Old College, Medical Faculty and McEwan Hall, Edinburgh University; the Central Hotel at Glasgow Central station; the Catholic Apostolic Church in Edinburgh; and Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), , p. 552. ==Music== George Thomson by Henry Raeburn One characteristic of Romanticism was the conscious creation of bodies of nationalist art music. In Scotland this form was dominant from the late eighteenth century to the early twentieth century.M. Gardiner, Modern Scottish Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2005), , pp. 195–6. In the 1790s Robert Burns embarked on an attempt to produce a corpus of Scottish national song, building on the work of antiquarians and musicologists such as William Tytler, James Beattie and Joseph Ritson.H. Matherson, \\"Robert Burns and national song\\", in D. Duff and C. Jones, eds, Scotland, Ireland, and the Romantic Aesthetic (Associated University Presse, 2007), , p. 77. Working with music engraver and seller James Johnson, he contributed about a third of the eventual songs of the collection known as the Scots Musical Museum, issued between 1787 and 1803 in six volumes.Donald A. Low, ed., The Songs of Robert Burns (London: Routledge, 1993), , p. 1054. Burns collaborated with George Thomson in A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs, published from 1793 to 1818, which adapted Scottish folk songs with \\"classical\\" arrangements. Thompson was inspired by hearing Scottish songs sung by visiting Italian castrati at the St Cecilia Concerts in Edinburgh. He collected Scottish songs and obtained musical arrangements from the best European composers, who included Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven. Burns was employed in editing the lyrics. A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs was published in five volumes between 1799 and 1818. It helped make Scottish songs part of the European cannon of classical music,D. A. Low, ed., The Songs of Robert Burns (London: Routledge, 1993), , pp. 16–18. while Thompson's work brought elements of Romanticism, such as harmonies based on those of Beethoven, into Scottish classical music. Also involved in the collection and publication of Scottish songs was Scott, whose first literary effort was Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, published in three volumes (1802–03). This collection first drew the attention of an international audience to his work, and some of his lyrics were set to music by Schubert, who also created a setting of Ossian.A. E. Hull, Music; Classical, Romantic & Modern (Ayer Publishing, 1927), , p. 99. Hamish MacCunn Perhaps the most influential composer of the first half of the nineteenth century was the German Felix Mendelssohn, who visited Britain ten times, for a total of twenty months, from 1829. Scotland inspired two of his most famous works, the overture Fingal's Cave (also known as the Hebrides Overture) and the Scottish Symphony (Symphony No. 3). On his last visit to England in 1847, he conducted his own Scottish Symphony with the Philharmonic Orchestra before Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.D. Conway, \\" 'Short, Dark and Jewish-Looking': Felix Mendelssohn in Britain\\", Jewish Year Book (2009), ed. S. Massil, p. xviii. Max Bruch (1838–1920) composed the Scottish Fantasy (1880) for violin and orchestra, which includes an arrangement of the tune \\"Hey Tuttie Tatie\\", best known for its use in the song Scots Wha Hae by Burns.Simon P. Keefe, ed., The Cambridge Companion to the Concerto (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , p. 130. By the late nineteenth century, there was in effect a national school of orchestral and operatic music in Scotland. Major composers included Alexander Mackenzie (1847–1935), William Wallace (1860–1940), Learmont Drysdale (1866–1909), Hamish MacCunn (1868–1916) and John McEwen (1868–1948). Mackenzie, who studied in Germany and Italy and mixed Scottish themes with German Romanticism,\\"Alexander Mackenzie\\" Scottish Composers: the Land With Music, retrieved 11 May 2012. is best known for his three Scottish Rhapsodies (1879–80, 1911), Pibroch for violin and orchestra (1889) and the Scottish Concerto for piano (1897), all involving Scottish themes and folk melodies. Wallace's work included an overture, In Praise of Scottish Poesie (1894); his pioneering symphonic poem about his namesake, medieval nationalist William Wallace AD 1305–1905 (1905); and a cantata, The Massacre of the Macpherson (1910).J. Stevenson, \\"William Wallace\\", Allmusic, retrieved 11 May 2011. Drysdale's work often dealt with Scottish themes, including the overture Tam O’ Shanter (1890), the cantata The Kelpie (1891), the tone poem A Border Romance (1904), and the cantata Tamlane (1905).\\"Learmont-Drysdale\\" Scottish Composers: the Land With Music, retrieved 11 May 2012. MacCunn's overture The Land of the Mountain and the Flood (1887), his Six Scotch Dances (1896), his operas Jeanie Deans (1894) and Dairmid (1897) and choral works on Scottish subjects have been described by I. G. C. Hutchison as the musical equivalent of Abbotsford and Balmoral.I. G. C. Hutchison, \\"Workshop of Empire: The Nineteenth Century\\" in J. Wormald, ed., Scotland: A History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), , p. 197. McEwen's more overtly national works include Grey Galloway (1908), the Solway Symphony (1911) and Prince Charlie, A Scottish Rhapsody (1924). ==Historiography== Raeburn's portrait of Walter Scott in 1822 In contrast to Enlightenment histories, which have been seen as attempting to draw general lessons about humanity from history, the German philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder in his Ideas upon Philosophy and the History of Mankind (1784), set out the concept of Volksgeist, a unique national spirit that drove historical change. As a result, a key element in the influence of Romanticism on intellectual life was the production of national histories.G. J. Williams, ed., Theatre Histories: An Introduction (London: Taylor & Francis, 2nd edn., 2010), , p. 274. The nature and existence of a national Scottish historiography has been debated among historians. Those authors who consider that such a national history did exist in this period indicate that it can be found outside of the production of major historical narratives, in works of antiquarianism and fiction. An important element in the emergence of a Scottish national history was an interest in antiquarianism, with figures like John Pinkerton (1758–1826) collecting sources such as ballads, coins, medals, songs and artefacts. Enlightenment historians had tended to react with embarrassment to Scottish history, particularly the feudalism of the Middle Ages and the religious intolerance of the Reformation. In contrast many historians of the early nineteenth century rehabilitated these areas as suitable for serious study.T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, Introduction, in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , pp. 2–3. Lawyer and antiquarian Cosmo Innes, who produced works on Scotland in the Middle Ages (1860), and Sketches of Early Scottish History (1861), has been likened to the pioneering history of Georg Heinrich Pertz, one of the first writers to collate the major historical accounts of German history.M. Bently, \\"Shape and pattern in British historical writing, 1815–1945, in S. MacIntyre, J. Maiguashca and A. Pok, eds, The Oxford History of Historical Writing: Volume 4: 1800–1945 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 206. Patrick Fraser Tytler's nine-volume history of Scotland (1828–43), particularity his sympathetic view of Mary, Queen of Scots, have led to comparisons with Leopold von Ranke, considered the father of modern scientific historical writing. Tytler was co-founder with Scott of the Bannatyne Society in 1823, which helped further the course of historical research in Scotland.M. Santini, The Impetus of Amateur Scholarship: Discussing and Editing Medieval Romances in Late-Eighteenth and Nineteenth- Century Britain (Peter Lang, 2009), , p. 195. Thomas M'Crie's (1797–1875) biographies of John Knox and Andrew Melville, figures generally savaged in the Enlightenment, helped rehabilitate their reputations.I. Brown, The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: Enlightenment, Britain and Empire (1707–1918) (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 9. W. F. Skene's (1809–92) three part study of Celtic Scotland (1886–91) was the first serious investigation of the region and helped spawn the Scottish Celtic Revival. Issues of race became important, with Pinkerton, James Sibbald (1745–1803) and John Jamieson (1758–1839) subscribing to a theory of Picto-Gothicism, which postulated a Germanic origin for the Picts and the Scots language.C. Kidd, Subverting Scotland's Past: Scottish Whig Historians and the Creation of an Anglo-British Identity 1689–1830 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), , p. 251. Thomas Carlyle, a major figure in Romantic historical writing Among the most significant intellectual figures associated with Romanticism was Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881), born in Scotland and later a resident of London. He was largely responsible for bringing the works of German Romantics such as Schiller and Goethe to the attention of a British audience.M. Cumming, The Carlyle Encyclopedia (Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2004), pp. 200ff and 223. An essayist and historian, he invented the phrase \\"hero- worship\\", lavishing largely uncritical praise on strong leaders such as Oliver Cromwell, Frederick the Great and Napoleon.G. W. Stocking, Romantic Motives: Essays on Anthropological Sensibility (University of Wisconsin Press, 1996), , p. 132. His The French Revolution: A History (1837) dramatised the plight of the French aristocracy, but stressed the inevitability of history as a force.M. Anesko, A. Ladd, J. R. Phillips, Romanticism and Transcendentalism (Infobase Publishing, 2006), , pp. 7–9. With French historian Jules Michelet, he is associated with the use of the \\"historical imagination\\".T. Elsaesser, Weimar Cinema and After: Germany's Historical Imaginary (London: Routledge, 2000), , p. 195. In Romantic historiography this led to a tendency to emphasise sentiment and identification, inviting readers to sympathise with historical personages and even to imagine interactions with them.P. A. Westover, Traveling to Meet the Dead 1750—1860: A Study of Literary Tourism and Necromanticism (ProQuest, 2007), , p. 101. In contrast to many continental Romantic historians, Carlyle remained largely pessimistic about human nature and events. He believed that history was a form of prophecy that could reveal patterns for the future. In the late nineteenth century he became one of a number of Victorian sage writers and social commentators.Chris Vanden Bossche, ed., Writings of Thomas Carlyle, Historical Essays (University of California Press, 2002), , pp. xxii–xxiii. Romantic writers often reacted against the empiricism of Enlightenment historical writing, putting forward the figure of the \\"poet-historian\\" who would mediate between the sources of history and the reader, using insight to create more than chronicles of facts. For this reason, Romantic historians such as Thierry saw Walter Scott, who had spent considerable effort uncovering new documents and sources for his novels, as an authority in historical writing.S. Evdokimova, Pushkin's Historical Imagination (Yale University Press, 1999), , pp. 33–4. Scott is now seen primarily as a novelist, but also produced a nine-volume biography of Napoleon,C. Harvie, Scotland, a Short History (Oxford: Oxford University Press), , p. 148. and has been described as \\"the towering figure of Romantic historiography in Transatlantic and European contexts\\", having a profound effect on how history, particularly that of Scotland, was understood and written.E. T. Bannet and S. Manning, Transatlantic Literary Studies, 1660–1830 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011), , p. 265. Historians that acknowledged his influence included Chateaubriand, Macaulay, and Ranke.H. Ben- Israel, English Historians on the French Revolution (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , p. 122. ==Science== Mary Somerville, a major influence on Humboldtian science in Britain Romanticism has also been seen as affecting scientific enquiry. Romantic attitudes to science varied, from distrust of the scientific enterprise to endorsing a non-mechanical science that rejected the mathematicised and the abstract theorising associated with Newton. Major trends in continental science associated with Romanticism include Naturphilosophie, developed by Friedrich Schelling (1775–1854), which focused on the necessity of reuniting man with nature,M. Bossi and S. Poggi, eds., Romanticism in Science: Science in Europe, 1790–1840 (Springer, 2010), , p. 31. and Humboldtian science, based on the work of Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859). As defined by Susan Cannon, this form of inquiry placed a stress on observation, accurate scientific instruments and new conceptual tools; disregarded the boundaries between different disciplines; and emphasised working in nature rather than the artificial laboratory.J. L. Heilbron, The Oxford Companion To the History of Modern Science (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), , p. 386. Privileging observation above calculation, Romantic scientists were often attracted to the areas where investigation, rather than calculation and theory, was most important, particularly the life sciences, geology, optics and astronomy.W. E. Burns, Science in the Enlightenment: An Encyclopedia (ABC-CLIO, 2003), , p. xviii. James Allard identifies the origins of Scottish \\"Romantic medicine\\" in the work of Enlightenment figures, particularly the brothers William (1718–83) and John Hunter (1728–93), who were, respectively, the leading anatomist and surgeon of their day and in the role of Edinburgh as a major centre of medical teaching and research.J. R. Allard, \\"Medicine\\", in J. Faflak and J. M. Wright, eds, A Handbook of Romanticism Studies (Oxford: John Wiley & Sons, 2012), , pp. 379–80. Key figures that were influenced by the Hunters' work and by Romanticism include John Brown (1735–88), Thomas Beddoes (1760–1808) and John Barclay (1758–1826). Brown argued in Elementa Medicinae (1780) that life is an essential \\"vital energy\\" or \\"excitability\\" and that disease is either the excessive or diminished redistribution of the normal intensity of the human organ, which became known as Brunonianism. This work was highly influential, particularly in Germany, on the development of Naturphilosophie.D. Berthold-Bond, Hegel's Theory of Madness (Suny, 1995), , p. 13. This work was translated and edited by Beddoes, another graduate of Edinburgh, whose own work, Hygeia, or Essays Moral and Medical (1807) expanded on these ideas. Following in this vein, Barclay in the 1810 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica identified physiology as the branch of medicine closest to metaphysics.H. De Almeida, Romantic Medicine and John Keats (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), , p. 68. Also important were the brothers John (1763–1820) and Charles Bell (1774–1842), who made significant advances in the study of the vascular and nervous systems, respectively.H. De Almeida, Romantic Medicine and John Keats (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), , p. 3.H. M. Dingwall, A History of Scottish Medicine: Themes and Influences (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2003), , p. 3. Robert Brown's paper \\"On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae\\" (1810) The University of Edinburgh was also a major supplier of surgeons for the royal navy, and Robert Jameson (1774–1854), Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh, ensured that a large number of these were surgeon-naturalists, who were vital in the Humboldtian and imperial enterprise of investigating nature throughout the world.J. Browne, \\"A science of empire: British biogeography before Darwin\\", Revue d'histoire des Sciences, vol. 45 (1992), p. 457. These included Robert Brown (1773–1858), one of the major figures in the early exploration of Australia. His later use of the microscope paralleled that noted among German students of Naturphilosophie, and he is credited with the discovery of the cell nucleus and the first observation of Brownian motion.H. De Almeida, Romantic Medicine and John Keats (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), , p. 323. Charles Lyell's work Principles of Geology (1830) is often seen as the foundation of modern geology. It was indebted to Humboldtian science in its insistence on measurements of nature,S. F. Cannon, Science in Culture: The Early Victorian Period (New York: Science History Publications, 1978), p. 83. and, according to Noah Heringman, retains a much of the \\"rhetoric of the sublime\\", which is characteristic of Romantic attitudes to landscape.N. Heringman, Romantic Rocks, Aesthetic Geology (Cornell University Press, 2004), , p. xiv. Romantic thinking was also evident in the writings of Hugh Miller, stonemason and geologist, who followed in the tradition of Naturphilosophie, arguing that nature was a pre-ordained progression towards the human race.A. Cunningham, N. Jardine, Romanticism and the Sciences (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), , p. 136. Publisher, historian, antiquarian and scientist Robert Chambers (1802–71) became a friend of Scott, writing a biography of him after the author's death. Chambers also became a geologist, researching in Scandinavia and Canada. His most influential work was the anonymously published Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844), which was the most comprehensive written argument in favour of evolution before the work of Charles Darwin (1809–82).R. G. Olson and R. Olson, Science And Religion, 1450–1900: From Copernicus to Darwin (JHU Press, 2006), , p. 187. His work was strongly influenced by transcendental anatomy, which, drawing on Goethe and Lorenz Oken (1779–1851),A. Bates, The Anatomy of Robert Knox: Murder, Mad Science and Medical Regulation in Nineteenth-Century Edinburgh (Sussex Academic Press, 2010), , p. 23. looked for ideal patterns and structure in natureJ. McLarren Caldwell, Literature And Medicine In Nineteenth-Century Britain: From Mary Shelley To George Eliot (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), , p. 14. and had been pioneered in Scotland by figures including Robert Knox (1791–1862).A. Cunningham and N. Jardine, Romanticism and the Sciences (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), , pp. 134–5. David Brewster (1781–1868), physicist, mathematician and astronomer, undertook key work in optics, where he provided a compromise between Goethe's Naturphilosophie-influenced studies and Newton's system, which Goethe attacked.F. Burwick, The Damnation of Newton: Goethe's Color Theory and Romantic Perception (Walter de Gruyter, 1986), , p. 34. His work would be important in later biological, geologicalD. A. Young, Mind Over Magma: The Story of Igneous Petrology (Princeton University Press, 2003), , p. 145. and astrological discoveries. Diligent measurement in South Africa allowed Thomas Henderson (1798–1844) make the observations that would allow him to be the first to calculate the distance to Alpha Centauri, before returning to Edinburgh to become the first Astronomer Royal for Scotland from 1834.R. Hutchins, British University Observatories, 1772–1939 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008), , p. 180. Influenced by Humboldt, and much praised by him, was Mary Somerville (1780–1872), mathematician, geographer, physicist, astronomer and one of the few women to gain recognition in science in the period.K. A. Neeley, Mary Somerville: Science, Illumination, and the Female Mind (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), , p. 230. A major contribution to the \\"magnetic crusade\\" declared by Humboldt was made by Scottish-born astronomer John Lamont (1805–79), head of the observatory in Munich, when he found a decennial period (ten-year cycle) in the Earth's magnetic field.M. T. Brück, Women in Early British and Irish Astronomy: Stars and Satellites (Springer, 2009), , p. 102. ==Politics== David Wilkie's flattering portrait of the kilted King George IV In the aftermath of the Jacobite risings, a movement to restore Stuart King James II of England to the throne, the British government enacted a series of laws that attempted to speed the process of the destruction of the clan system. Measures included a ban on the bearing of arms, the wearing of tartan and limitations on the activities of the Episcopalian Church. Most of the legislation was repealed by the end of the eighteenth century as the Jacobite threat subsided. Soon after, there was a process of the rehabilitation of highland culture. Tartan had already been adopted for highland regiments in the British army, which poor highlanders joined in large numbers until the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, but by the nineteenth century it had largely been abandoned by the ordinary people of the region. In the 1820s, tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe.J. L. Roberts, The Jacobite Wars: Scotland and the Military Campaigns of 1715 and 1745 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , pp. 193–5.M. Sievers, The Highland Myth as an Invented Tradition of 18th and 19th Century and Its Significance for the Image of Scotland (GRIN Verlag, 2007), , pp. 22–5. The international craze for tartan, and for idealising a romanticised Highlands, was set off by the Ossian cycleP. Morère, Scotland and France in the Enlightenment (Bucknell University Press, 2004), , pp. 75–6.W. Ferguson, The identity of the Scottish Nation: an Historic Quest (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), , p. 227. and further popularised by the works of Scott. His \\"staging\\" of the royal visit of King George IV to Scotland in 1822 and the king's wearing of tartan resulted in a massive upsurge in demand for kilts and tartans that could not be met by the Scottish linen industry. Individual clan tartans was largely defined in this period, and they became a major symbol of Scottish identity.N. C. Milne, Scottish Culture and Traditions (Paragon Publishing, 2010), , p. 138. This \\"Highlandism\\", by which all of Scotland was identified with the culture of the Highlands, was cemented by Queen Victoria's interest in the country, her adoption of Balmoral as a major royal retreat and her interest in \\"tartanry\\". The romanticisation of the Highlands and the adoption of Jacobitism into mainstream culture have been seen as defusing the potential threat to the Union with England, the House of Hanover and the dominant Whig government.F. McLynn, The Jacobites (London: Taylor & Francis, 1988), , p. 211. In many countries Romanticism played a major part in the emergence of radical independence movements through the development of national identities. Tom Nairn argues that Romanticism in Scotland did not develop along the lines seen elsewhere in Europe, leaving a \\"rootless\\" intelligentsia, who moved to England or elsewhere and so did not supply a cultural nationalism that could be communicated to the emerging working classes. Graeme Moreton and Lindsay Paterson both argue that the lack of interference of the British state in civil society meant that the middle classes had no reason to object to the union.A. Ichijo, Scottish Nationalism and the Idea of Europe: Concepts Of Europe and the Nation (London: Routledge, 2004), , pp. 35–6. Atsuko Ichijo argues that national identity cannot be equated with a movement for independence.A. Ichijo, Scottish Nationalism and the Idea of Europe: Concepts Of Europe and the Nation (London: Routledge, 2004), , p. 37. Moreton suggests that there was a Scottish nationalism, but that it was expressed in terms of \\"Unionist nationalism\\".A. Ichijo, Scottish Nationalism and the Idea of Europe: Concepts Of Europe and the Nation (London: Routledge, 2004), , pp. 3–4. A form of political radicalism remained within Scottish Romanticism, surfacing in events like the foundation of the Friends of the People in 1792 and in 1853 the National Association for the Vindication of Scottish Rights, which was in effect a federation of romantics, radical churchmen and administrative reformers.D. Hempton, Religion and Political Culture in Britain and Ireland: From the Glorious Revolution to the Decline of Empire (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), , p. 69. However, Scottish identity was not directed into nationalism until the twentieth century.N. Davidson, The Origins of Scottish Nationhood (Pluto Press, 2008), , p. 187. ==Philosophy== Dugald Stewart, a major figure in the popularisation of Common Sense Realism The dominant school of philosophy in Scotland in the late eighteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth century is known as Common Sense Realism. It argued that there are certain concepts, such as our existence, the existence of solid objects and some basic moral \\"first principles\\", that are intrinsic to our make-up and from which all subsequent arguments and systems of morality must be derived. It can be seen as an attempt to reconcile the new scientific developments of the Enlightenment with religious belief.Paul C. Gutjahr, Charles Hodge: Guardian of American Orthodoxy (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), , p. 39. The origins of these arguments are in a reaction to the scepticism that became dominant in the Enlightenment, particularly that articulated by Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711–76). This branch of thinking was first formulated by Thomas Reid (1710–96) in his An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense (1764).E. J. Wilson and P. H. Reill, Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment (Infobase Publishing, 2nd edn., 2004), , pp. 499–501. It was popularised in Scotland by figures including Dugald Stewart (1753–1828) and in England by James Beattie. Stewart's students included Walter Scott, Walter Chambers and Thomas Brown,B. W. Redekop, \\"Reid's influence in Britain, Germany, France and America\\", in T. Cuneo and R. van Woudenberg, eds, The Cambridge Companion to Thomas Reid (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), , pp. 313–40. and this branch of thought would later be a major influence on Charles Darwin.C. Loring Brace, Evolution In An Anthropological View (Rowman & Littlefield, 2000), , p. 51. William Hamilton (1788–1856) attempted to combine Reid's approach with the philosophy of Kant.J. Skorupski, The Cambridge Companion to Mill (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), , p. 143. Common Sense Realism not only dominated Scottish thought but also had a major impact in France,A. Hook, \\"The French taste for Scottish Romantic literature\\", in D. Dawson and P. Morère, eds, Scotland and France in the Enlightenment (Bucknell University Press, 2004), , p. 93. the United States, Germany and other countries. Victor Cousin (1792–1867) was the most important proponent in France, becoming Minister of Education and incorporating the philosophy into the curriculum. In Germany the emphasis on careful observation influenced Humboldt's ideas about science and was a major factor in the development of German Idealism.M. Kuehn, Scottish Common Sense in Germany, 1768–1800: A Contribution to the History of Critical Philosophy (McGill-Queens, 1987), , pp. 144 and 166. James McCosh (1811–94) brought Common Sense Realism directly from Scotland to North American in 1868 when he became president of Princeton University, which soon became a stronghold of the movement. Noah Porter (1811–92) taught Common Sense Realism to generations of students at Yale. As a result, it would be a major influence on the development of one of the most important offshoots of Romanticism in New England, Transcendentalism, particularly in the writing of Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–82). ==Decline== William McTaggart's The Storm, 1890, incorporating elements of Impressionism into the Scottish landscape tradition In literature, Romanticism is often thought to have ended in the 1830s,P. Poplawski, English Literature in Context (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008), , p. 306.J. P. Klancher, A Concise Companion to the Romantic Age (Oxford: John Wiley & Sons, 2009), , p. 1. with a few commentators, like Margaret Drabble, describing it as over by 1848.M. Drabble, The Oxford Companion to English Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, fifth edn., 1985), pp. 842–3. Romanticism continued much longer in some places and areas of endeavour, particularly in music, where it has been dated from 1820 to 1910.M. Hinson, Anthology of Romantic Piano Music (Alfred Music Publishing, 2002), , p. 4. The death of Scott in 1832 has been seen as marking the end of the great romantic generation,G. E. Paul Gillespie, Romantic Drama (John Benjamins, 1994), , p. 32. and Scottish literature and culture in general lost some of its international prominence from this point. Scott's reputation as a writer also went into decline in the late nineteenth century, only recovering in the twentieth.I. Duncan, \\"Walter Scott\\" in D. S. Kastan, The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature, Volume 1 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), , p. 462. Economic and social change, particularly the better communications brought by the railways, decreased the ability of Edinburgh to function as an alternative cultural capital to London, with its publishing industry moving to London.I. Duncan, Scott's Shadow: The Novel in Romantic Edinburgh (Princeton University Press, 2007), , p. 306. Lack of opportunities in politics and letters led many talented Scots to leave for England and elsewhere. The sentimental Kailyard tradition of J. M. Barrie and George MacDonald, of those that continued to pursue Scottish topics at the end of the nineteenth century, was seen by Tom Nairn as \\"sub-romantic\\".A. Blaikie, The Scots Imagination and Modern Memory (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), , pp. 111–12. In art, the tradition of Scottish landscape painting continued into the later nineteenth century, but Romanticism gave way to influences including French Impressionism, Post-Impressionism and eventually Modernism.F. Fowle, \\"Patterns of taste: Scottish collectors and the making of cultural identity in the late nineteenth century\\", in F. Cullen, J. Morrison, eds, A Shared Legacy: Essays On Irish And Scottish Art And Visual Culture British Art and Visual Culture Since 1750, New Readings (Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2005), , pp. 181–2. The Scots baronial style continued to be popular until the end of the nineteenth century, when other styles began to dominate.J. Gifford, Perth and Kinross (Yale University Press, 2007), , p. 83. Although Romanticism persisted in music much longer than in almost every area, it fell out of fashion in the twentieth century and anti- Romantic currents in Britain virtually buried Victorian and Edwardian music not written by Edward Elgar or Arthur Sullivan. The idea of the historical imagination was replaced with the source-based empiricism championed by Ranke.T. S. Martin, Green History: The Future of the Past (University Press of America, 2000), , p. 85. Marinel Ash has noted that after the death of Scott, Scottish national history lost its momentum, and the Scottish literati stopped writing Scottish histories. Colin Kidd has observed a change of attitudes to historical writing and suggests that this was one reason for a lack of the development of political nationalism. In science, the rapid expansion of knowledge increased a tendency towards specialisation and professionalism and a decline of the polymath \\"man of letters\\" and amateurs that had dominated Romantic science.A. Walton Litz, Modernism and the New Criticism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , p. 378. Common Sense Realism began to decline in Britain in the face of the English empiricism outlined by John Stuart Mill in his An Examination of Sir William Hamilton's Philosophy (1865).Walter A. Elwell, ed., Evangelical Dictionary of Theology (Baker Academic, 2nd edn., 2001), , p. 1079. ==Influence== The young Leo Tolstoy, one of the many writers directly influenced by Scottish Romanticism Scotland can make a claim to have begun the Romantic movement with writers such as Macpherson and Burns.G. Carruthers and A. Rawesin \\"Introduction: romancing the Celt\\", in G. Carruthers and A. Rawes, eds, English Romanticism and the Celtic World (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), , p. 6. In Scott it produced a figure of international fame and influence, whose virtual invention of the historical novel would be picked up by writers across the world, including Alexandre Dumas and Honoré de Balzac in France, Leo Tolstoy in Russia and Alessandro Manzoni in Italy.P. Melville Logan, O. George, S. Hegeman and E. Kristal, The Encyclopedia of the Novel, Volume 1 (Oxford: John Wiley & Sons, 2011), , p. 384. The tradition of Scottish landscape painting significantly influenced art in Britain and elsewhere through figures like J. M. W. Turner, who took part in the emerging Scottish \\"grand tour\\".F. M.

In music, the early efforts of men like Burns, Scott and Thompson helped insert Scottish music into European, particularly German, classical music, and the later contributions of composers like MacCuun were part of a Scottish contribution to the British revival of interest in classical music in the late nineteenth century.W. Apel, Harvard Dictionary of Music (Harvard University Press, 2nd edn., 1969), , p. 760. The idea of history as a force and the romantic concept of revolution were highly influential on transcendentalists like Emerson, and through them on American literature in general. Romantic science maintained the prominence and reputation that Scotland had begun to obtain in the Enlightenment and helped in the development of many emerging fields of investigation, including geology and biology. According to Robert D. Purington, \\"to some the nineteenth century seems to be the century of Scottish science\\".Robert D. Purrington, Physics in the Nineteenth Century (Rutgers University Press, 1997), , p. 14. Politically the initial function of Romanticism as pursued by Scott and others helped to diffuse some of the tension created by Scotland's place in the Union, but it also helped to ensure the survival of a common and distinct Scottish national identity that would play a major part in Scottish life and emerge as a significant factor in Scottish politics from the second half of the twentieth century.N. Davidson, The Origins of Scottish Nationhood (Pluto Press, 2000), , pp. 162–3 and 200-1. Externally, modern images of Scotland worldwide, its landscape, culture, sciences and arts, are still largely defined by those created and popularised by Romanticism.G. Jack and A. M.

A self-proclaimed imitator of Keith Emerson, Vescovi was popular for his histrionic stage presence and eccentric clothing as much as for his virtuoso keyboard playing.The Trip: intervista a Joe Vescovi ==Biography== Born in Savona, Vescovi founded his first rock band, \\"The Lonely Boys\\", at the age of 17. He played with this band in Germany and the Netherlands without achieving much success. After returning to Italy, he played for a while in a band called \\"Toto e i Tati\\" led by Toto Cutugno. In the late 1960s Vescovi joined the progressive rock band The Trip from Turin, replacing Ritchie Blackmore, who had left the band to join Deep Purple. Blackmore would later consider Vescovi to be the keyboardist for his band Rainbow, although David Stone would be chosen instead. Vescovi is often called the leader of The Trip, both because of the heavy influence of his keyboard playing style on the sound of the band and his frontman role in live performances.Joe Vescovi This became more true from 1972 on, after founder Pino Sinnone had left and the band became a musical trio closely resembling Emerson, Lake, & Palmer in both instrumentation and style. After The Trip, Vescovi joined the Italian prog rock band Acqua Fragile and later Dik-Dik, one of the most popular Italian pop-rock bands ever. He also collaborated with Umberto Tozzi and founded two minor bands of his own, \\"Tarrot\\" (who were hired by ex-Premiata Forneria Marconi Franz Di Cioccio to play the musical score for the 1982 film Attila flagello di Dio) and \\"Night Fudge\\". ==Footnotes== Category:Italian keyboardists Category:Progressive rock musicians Category:1949 births Category:2014 deaths ","title":"Joe Vescovi"},{"id":"35888883","text":"The 2002 Selecta-PBA All-Filipino Cup Finals was the best-of-5 basketball championship series of the 2002 PBA All-Filipino Cup and the conclusion of the conference's playoffs.

The conference was organized together with Maven7 and the Hungarian Sociological Association. June 17–18, 2009. Conference. The Unexpected Link: Using Network Science to Tackle Social Problems Featured topics of the conference were networks linking nature and society; global networks of risk; teams of collaboration - creativity and collusion; the emergence of social order; organizations, markets, and governance; biological webs and human impacts on the environment; bridging the gap between social and biological networks, as well as future directions in network science and transnational - interdisciplinary collaborations: what should a center for network science aim at? ==PhD program== The Central European University offers Phd programs in Economics and in Political Science with a certificate in Network Science. The Center for Network Science provides an organizational platform for research using network science tools. The students have to take some mandatory and elective courses of the Center of Network Science to participate. ==Research projects== Ceunet CNS’s own software for analysis and handling of network data. The software is still under development focusing on the following functions: conversion and handling, role analysis/blockmodeling, second-order ties, and simultaneous handling of attributional and relational data. This is a freeware software. Mapping European Network Science (2010) In this project the co-authorship network of European scholars, who presented any paper at INSNA Sunbelt conferences or the NetSci annual conferences between 2005 and 2008 is mapped. The conclusion is basically that the European network science is very fragmented. Growing more cohesive would mean a higher scientific impact as component size and citation count have a positive correlation. ==Honors== The article of Balázs Vedres, director of Center for Network Science, won two prizes in 2011. The title of the paper is “Structural Folds: Generative Disruption in Overlapping Groups” and is co-authored with David Stark. It aims at analyzing the relationship between structural folds in a business group and the emergence of innovations and new, creative ideas. The awards were the 2011 Viviana Zelizer Award from the American Sociological Association (ASA), which is given every year to the authors of an outstanding article in the field of economic sociology and the 2011 Roger V.

Though Newsday Columnist Mike McGrady, who died May 13 at 78 won an Overseas Press Club award for his dispatches from Vietnam, he will always be remembered too as the orchestrator of the 1969 literary hoax 'Naked Came the Stranger'. A cringe inducing naughty-housewife novel by \\"Penelope Ashe,\\" it was actually the work of McGrady and his newsroom buddies. Meant as a parody of trashy best sellers, it quickly became one. \\"Some of the chapters were too good,\\" a bemused McGrady told Time after the truth came out. \\"I had to work like hell to make them bad enough to use.\\"Time Magazine May 28, 2012 Sex sells, his spoof sold many more copies than his prize winning book, A Dove in Vietnam which was McGrady's answer to a hawkish challenge from John Steinbeck. Replacing Steinbeck in Newsday, his columns were widely syndicated in the U.S. and abroad by Newsday and the Los Angeles Times Syndicate. And his work won the Overseas Press Club Award for best interpretive reporting of foreign affairs. In a May 22, 2012 piece Bob Keeler relates he didn't like Steinbeck's letters from the war and proposed he go there to write a series called \\"A Dove in Vietnam\\". The publisher Bill Moyers—LBJ's former press secretary—liked the idea. The resulting stories told the ugly truth about the war. They also soured Guggenheim's relationship with his star, Moyers\\"...... \\" When people talk about Mike, that book should leap to mind -- not the naked hoax book. The Vietnam War was a far more deadly hoax, and Mike wrote powerfully to expose it for what it was. In the pages of Newsday, on that poisonously divisive war, John Steinbeck was flat wrong. Mike McGrady was absolutely right. This is no small epitaph for a great life.\\"Newsday by Bob Keeler, May 22, 2012 According to the 1990 book: Newsday A Candid History of the Respectable Tabloid, Wm Morrow & Co. by Robert Keeler, both the spoof and his coverage deepened the divide between Newsday's owner and its publisher Bill Moyers which eventually led to the sale of Newsday to the Los Angeles Times and Moyers resignation. On the day after his May 15, 2012, obituary in The New York Times, a Times editorial entitled \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" pointed out: \\"Mr. McGrady's strange success was a product of its time, which happened to be very good ones for newspapers. That newsroom in particular -- Newsday's in Garden City, Long Island -- was a close knit group of men and women who won Pulitzer Prizes and covered the world. Mr. McGrady's bad fiction project, in fact, was interrupted by a reporting tour of Vietnam and then a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard. What he built in the years that followed --news articles and columns, movie and restaurant reviews -- remains a fine body of work, all on top of the fame from \\"Naked Came the Stranger.\\"New York Times Editorial May 16, 2012 His subsequent book Stranger than Naked or How to Write Dirty Books for Fun and Profit, a manual, Wyden 1970. Mike McGrady tells the wonky naked truth behind the spoof. Although a romp, McGrady's intent was deadly serious. Serious enough to turn down an offer of a half million dollars for a sequel.The Washington Post by Matt Schudel, May 16, 2012 In an era that preferred its women in the kitchen, Mike McGrady continued to challenge the status quo. Coining the word househusband he switched roles with his wife for a year. That experiment was the basis of his book; The Kitchen Sink Papers, my life as a househusband. Portions of the book were widely syndicated by Newsday and the Los Angeles Times. Published by both Doubleday and New American Library, it went on to become a Readers Digest Condensed Book. \\"Women looked at me as if I were trying to break into prison\\", he told the Los Angeles Times in 1975. \\"Men looked at me as if I were Benedict Arnold.\\" In Lord of Publishing, Open Road 2013, legendary literary agent Sterling Lord tells us \\"Mike McGrady was no ordinary journalist\\". He also notes, \\"while a househusband is a common occurrence in the twenty-first century, when Mike wrote the book in 1975, he was moving into uncharted domesticity.\\" (Mike McGrady dedicated the book to his daughter.) Hitting a nerve in his often reprinted Feb. 2, 1976 Newsweek My Turn piece: \\"Let'em Eat Leftovers\\" can be found in many current anthologies. Among them Growing Ideas: a Reader for Writers, Between Worlds, a reader, rhetoric and handbook and Discovering Ideas: An Anthology for Writers Women's issues were never foreign to McGrady, in his grandfather Frank Robinson's 1911 bid for the Washington state legislature as Farmer-Labor candidate, Article 9 read: On May 20, 2012 the Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"His experiences switching roles with his wife turned him into a feminist, which may have influenced his decision to write two books with \\"Deep Throat\\" star, Linda Lovelace: Ordeal (1980) and Out of Bondage(1986) which detail the abuse she endured in the pornography industry.\\"Los Angeles Times by Elaine Woo, May 20, 2012 He was as ahead of his time as his grandfather was. People were unready for the Linda Lovelace story until Gloria Steinem stepped in with an article in MS Magazine after Ordeal was published. Ordeal became an international best seller and turned Linda into a feminist heroine of the women's movement speaking out against pornography at government hearings, feminist groups and colleges. Lovelace later testified before the 1986 U.S. Attorney General's Commission on Pornography. And Gloria Steinem wrote the introduction to the second book Out of Bondage. While Ordeal was on the best seller list, his brother, a well known science writer joined him on the list. People Magazine June 8, 1980 noted \\"Here's One for the Book: Simultaneous Best-Sellers by the McGrady Brothers\\" \\"The Bronte sisters and the Waugh brothers made it big as writers, but Pat and Mike McGrady have done what no siblings in history have accomplished --this spring they've been on the best seller list at the same time. a first...\\"People Magazine June 8, 1980 Between stints writing books and magazine pieces, McGrady wrote for Newsday. At the forefront of his era he made a critical impact on the culture. As a columnist, he went from Selma to Montgomery, to confrontations in the streets of Chicago. Talking with writers, politicians, starlets and kids, he commented on life including family life and won the National Headliner's Award for \\"Consistently Outstanding Columns\\". As a foreign correspondent he dug into history in the making, from Saigon to Hanoi and won the Overseas Press Club Award. Trading hats later in his career he reviewed restaurants for the paper.

Kopplin has campaigned to keep creationism out of public school science classrooms and been involved with other separation of church and state causes. He has opposed school vouchers because they provide public money to schools which may teach creationism. As a high school student, he organized seventy-eight Nobel laureate scientists in a campaign against the Louisiana Science Education Act, a creationism law. He is also involved with science funding policy and curriculum and textbook policy. His new campaign calls for a launching Second Giant Leap for Humankind, calling for Barack Obama to invest $1 trillion in research and education. Kopplin has been interviewed on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher, where Bill Maher noted, on the show, that Kopplin was the youngest guest ever to appear on his show.Real Time with Bill Maher: Episode 277, HBO, April 5, 2013 MSN.com called Kopplin the Doogie Howser of political activists.19-year-old activist fighting to protect education from creationism , MSN Now, January 16, 2013 Kopplin has been featured by numerous international media outlets that include Vogue, Mashable, The New York Times, the Washington Post, io9, Slate, the Huffington Post, Moyers and Company, MSNBC, NPR, and Public Radio International. ==Personal life== Kopplin was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. His parents are Andrea D. (Neighbours) and Andy Kopplin, who is the first deputy mayor and chief administrative officer for the City of New Orleans. Andy Kopplin was chief of staff for Governors Murphy J. Foster, Jr. and Kathleen Blanco and founded the Louisiana Recovery Authority under Blanco. Zack Kopplin graduated from Baton Rouge Magnet High School of Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 2011 and from Rice University in Houston, Texas in 2015. On NPR's Science Friday, Kopplin stated that he was born with anosmia, meaning he does not have a sense of smell. ==Education activismLouisiana Science Education Act=== As a senior at Baton Rouge Magnet High School, in Louisiana, he launched a campaign to repeal the Louisiana Science Education Act, which has been described by the international science community as a creationism law. Kopplin ran his campaign through his RepealCreationism website. Kopplin joined with Louisiana State Senator Karen Carter Peterson, a Democrat from New Orleans and chair of the Louisiana Democratic Party who sponsored two attempts to repeal the Louisiana Science Education Act. Peterson vowed to keep sponsoring bills, “until we defeat this law.” With the help of Nobel laureate chemist, Harry Kroto, Kopplin gathered the support of 78 Nobel laureate scientists, who endorsed the repeal effort. The repeal is also supported by many other prominent scientists including Kenneth Miller. Kopplin gathered the support of major science organizations behind the repeal including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the largest science organization in the world with over 10 million members. He also gathered endorsements from the Clergy Letter Project and the New Orleans City Council. ===Science textbooks=== Kopplin played a major role in convincing the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education to adopt new life science textbooks. After the new textbooks were adopted, the Baton Rouge Advocate wrote an editorial calling the high school senior \\"the newest giant- killer in state education policy.\\"Evolution vs. Creation, The Gambit, March 08, 2011 Kopplin spearheaded a campaign to prevent attempts by Louisiana legislators to reverse the board's decision.Creationism and revisionist history threaten to invade our classrooms, The Guardian, Zack Kopplin, May 20, 2013 ===School vouchers=== Kopplin has also played a role in the discussion over education reform in America. He has identified and exposed a number of the schools in Louisiana's school voucher program using creationist curricula or teaching creationism. Kopplin worked with MSNBC's Melissa Harris-Perry Show to expose over 300 creationist voucher schools nationwide. ===Second Giant Leap=== In 2013, Kopplin, along with Louisiana-based investigative journalist Lamar White, launched Second Giant Leap for Humankind, a political action committee which advocates for $1 trillion in new funding to be appropriated to scientific research and development and also an end to denialist legislation. Kopplin wrote an open letter to U.S. President Barack Obama asking him to support the Second Giant Leap campaign. Kopplin debated Wall Street Journal editorial board member Stephen Moore on the return on investment for funding science while on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher. After Kopplin pointed out that Moore was not a scientist, when Moore questioned National Science Foundation grants, the clip was picked up by Upworthy and went viral. ===Michele Bachmann=== According to the Huffington Post, Kopplin challenged Michele Bachmann to back up statements she made about Nobel laureate scientists supporting creationism. Kopplin made his challenge on the basis of the Nobel laureate scientists who supported his anti-creationism campaign. The New Orleans Gambit followed up on this question while she was in New Orleans.Allman, Kevin (June 17, 2011). \\"Michele Bachmann on intelligent design\\".

By the outbreak of World War II Bischoff had risen to the rank of Sturmbannführer (major) in the SS. ===Einsatzgruppen=== During the September 1939 invasion of Poland Bischoff served as leader of Einsatzkommando 1/IV (a sub-unit of Lothar Beutel's Einsatzgruppe IV) which was deployed in the northern Polish territories of Pomerania, Warsaw and Polesie. Bischoff's unit was active in the towns of Jastrowie and Zambrów and was involved in the bloody pacification of Bydgoszcz (Bromberg) along with the extermination of ethnic Poles carried out as part of Operation Tannenberg, the Nazi ethnic cleansing campaign targeting Poland's intelligentsia and other members of the nation's elite. On September 27, 1939 Bischoff and his Einsatzkommando led a raid on the town of Pułtusk, which ended with the mass-expulsion of the town's large Jewish population and their deportation across the Narew River into the now Soviet-occupied east.Ernst Klee: The Encyclopedia of persons to the Third Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. Who was that before and after 1945. Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, Zweite aktualisierte Auflage, Frankfurt am Main 2005, S. 51. Penguin Books, second edition, Frankfurt am Main 2005, p. 51. Einsatzgruppe IV was also involved in the round-up of Warsaw's Jewish inhabitants, setting in motion their eventual ghettoization. Einsatzgruppe IV was formally disbanded on November 20, 1939. Its officers and men were stationed in the Polish General Government and converted into stationary units of the Sicherheitspolizei (security police) in Warsaw, under the command of SS-Standartenführer Josef Albert Meisinger. ===Poznań and Magdeburg=== In August 1940 Bischoff was reassigned to the newly-annexed territory of Reichsgau Wartheland where he served under SS- Brigadeführer Ernst Damzog as commander of the Sicherheitsdienst and Sicherheitspolizei (KdS) for the city of Poznań (Posen). In this capacity Bischoff was also the commandant of the Fort VII concentration camp, which was initially called \\"KZ Posen\\" and in 1939 became \\"Übergangslager (transit camp) Fort VII\\". While primarily a detention center, Fort VII also served as a regular execution site for many local Poles, Jews and the physically or mentally disabled. Prisoners usually remained in the camp for about six months, before being sentenced to death, a long prison term or transfer to a larger concentration camp.hospital Owinska and Fort VII in Poznan at deathcamps.org Bischoff was promoted to the rank of SS-Obersturmbannführer (lieutenant colonel) in September 1941 and returned to Germany, where he had been appointed chief of the SD and the Security Police for the city of Magdeburg. Bischoff would play a central role in orchestrating the deportation of the Jews from Magdeburg and the nearby towns of Stendal, Dessau, Bernburg and Aschersleben. Hundreds of German Jews were deported by the SS between November 1942 - March 1943. The initial wave of deportees were routed mainly to Theresienstadt and the Warsaw Ghetto while later rail transports were dispatched directly to Auschwitz-Birkenau.Alfred Gottwaldt, Diana Schulle: The Deportation of Jews from the German Reich 1941-1945 - An Annotated Chronology, Wiesbaden, 2005, . == V-weapons security chief == In December 1943 Bischoff was transferred to the SS-Main Economic and Administrative Office (SS-WVHA) and assigned to the general staff of SS-Obergruppenführer Hans Kammler, ostensibly as a representative of the Ministry of Armaments. Kammler was the director of Amtsgruppe C (Buildings and Works) of the SS-WVHA. This department was concerned primarily with the extensive engineering and construction projects of the SS. This included the building of factories and other manufacturing facilities for Germany's various secret weapons programs. Bischoff was appointed \\"defense officer\\" for one such highly-secretive project: Germany's V-weapons program. As the chief of security Bischoff managed counter-intelligence operations designed to conceal the missile production industry's existence from Allied intelligence. He was also responsible for preventing organized attempts by prisoner-laborers to sabotage the V-weapons during the assembly process.Ernst Klee: The Encyclopedia of persons to the Third Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. Who was that before and after 1945. Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, Zweite aktualisierte Auflage, Frankfurt am Main 2005, S. 51. Penguin Books, second edition, Frankfurt am Main 2005, p. 51. Much of Germany's V-1 flying bombs and V-2 ballistic missiles were produced at Mittelwerk, a massive armaments factory housed in an elaborate tunnel system in the Harz Mountains that had been built, and was partially administered, by Kammler's SS department. The complex and dangerous work performed to assemble the V-weapons themselves was done under brutal conditions in the tunnels by thousands of slave-laborers (mainly Russians, Poles and French, among other nationalities) drawn from the inmate population of the adjunct Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. ===Mittelbau-Dora=== In February 1944 the various police and security services operating in the Nordhausen district (which surrounded Mittelwerk and the subsidiary camp of Mittelbau-Dora) were put under the control of Bischoff's organization, now headquartered in Ilfeld. Counter-sabotage operations were swiftly begun, mainly targeting the numerous resistance organizations operating among the various prisoner groups working in the tunnels at Mittelwerk and in the camp.Jens-Christian Wagner, Production of Death: The Mittelbau-Dora, Göttingen, 2001 S. 666th. Mittelbau-Dora's Politische Abteilung (political department) had much of the resistance leadership among the camp's Russian, French and Communist inmates rounded up in November 1944 and interned in solitary confinement. Many of those taken into custody were interrogated under torture with some later being executed.Sellier, Andre. A History of the Dora Camp. Chicago: Ivan R. Dee. 2003. In February 1945 the SS administration of Mittelbau-Dora was reorganized under former Auschwitz commandant Richard Baer. Under this new arrangement, Bischoff took over as head of the camp's internal Sicherheitsdienst (SD) department, which he employed against the camp's inmates (and the remaining resistance groups) during the closing months of the war. Bischoff staged a wave of mass-executions in March 1945 that saw hundreds of the camp's prisoners, mostly Soviet POWs, killed in a series of mass- hangings. Much of the surviving leadership of the camp's resistance organizations were also shot by firing squad prior to the liberation of Mittelbau-Dora by the US Army in April 1945. In all, roughly 20,000 people died at either Mittelwerk or Mittelbau-Dora between 1943 and 1945. == Post-war == Following the German defeat Bischoff went into hiding in Bavaria and later Hamburg before returning to Magdeburg, now located inside the Soviet occupation zone of Germany. He was able to evade capture by Allied authorities for several months before he was eventually identified and arrested by the Soviet security services in January 1946. He was interned at NKVD Special Camp No. 1 near Mühlberg until September 1948 when he was transferred to NKVD Special Camp No. 2 (formerly the Buchenwald concentration camp) outside of Weimar. In January 1950 Bischoff was deported to the Soviet Union where he was sentenced to 25 years hard labor by a military tribunal in Moscow and sent to a German POW camp located in Siberia. Bischoff would remain imprisoned in the USSR for the next five years. In October 1955 Bischoff would be among the last German prisoners of war and war criminals to be released from captivity by the Soviet Union. After resettling in West Germany, Bischoff was employed by the German Red Cross-Tracing Service from 1957 to 1965.Jens-Christian Wagner, Production of Death: The Mittelbau-Dora, Göttingen, 2001 S. 666th. ===Essen- Dora trial=== On November 17, 1967 Bischoff and two other former SS officers who had served with him at Mittelbau-Dora, were indicted for war crimes by the district court in Essen. The charges against Bischoff stemmed from his involvement in the series of mass executions that occurred at Mittelbau-Dora between February - April 1945. He was also charged with the use of torture on prisoners under interrogation. Bischoff entered a plea of not guilty.André Sellier: Forced Labor in the missile tunnel - History of the Dora camp, Lüneburg, 2000, p. 518. The trial (known as the Essen-Dora Process) began in November 1967 and would continue for two and a half years. The proceedings included the testimony of over 300 witnesses, among them former Nazi Armaments Minister Albert Speer and the famed inventor of the V-2 rocket, Wernher von Braun, now a premier rocket scientist in the United States. On May 5, 1970 the case against Bischoff was postponed by the court due to reasons of his poor health.Ernst Klee: The Encyclopedia of the Third Reich persons, Fischer Taschenbuch 2005, S. 51, Quelle: 24 Js 549/61 (Z) OStA Köln. Penguin Books 2005, p. 51, source: 24 Js 549/61 (Z) OSTA Cologne. He was thus able to avoid being formally convicted of war crimes. The case against Bischoff was dropped on the grounds that: Other efforts to prosecute Bischoff for his wartime activities also met with little success. An investigation by the district court of West Berlin into his involvement with the Einsatzgruppen killings in Bydgoszcz was discontinued in 1971, citing a lack of evidence. A further effort to prosecute Bischoff, this time for atrocities committed during his tenure as Gestapo chief in Poznań, was likewise abandoned in 1976, once again owing to Bischoff's precarious health. Bischoff continued to reside in West Germany for the remainder of his life. He died in Hamburg on January 5, 1993.Sellier, Andre. A History of the Dora Camp. Chicago: Ivan R.

The station is located on the West Rhine Railway () between Koblenz to Mainz. Furthermore, the station is the beginning and end of the Rheinhessen Railway to/from Worms. The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 4 station. ==History == On 17 October 1859, the Hessian Ludwig Railway (Hessische Ludwigsbahn) opened the West Rhine Railway, which ran between Mainz and Bingen, initially only for freight operations. The station now called Bingen (Rhein) Stadt was opened with the line as the border station of the Grand Duchy of Hesse. On the other side of the border in Prussia, the Rhenish Railway Company operated its own station, then called Bingerbrück, but now called Bingen (Rhein) Hauptbahnhof (Bingen (Rhine) main station). Around 1880 the station building was built to a design of the architect Hans Kleinschmidt. A relay interlocking in a gantry signal box spanning two tracks was put into operation in 1937. The Bingen Stadt signal box (Bnb) and the three signal boxes of Bingerbrück Ostturm (Bot), Bingerbrück Kreuzbach (Bkb) and Bingerbrück Westturm (Bwt) in the nearby Bingen Hbf were decommissioned on 3 February 1996 and replaced by the central interlocking Bf on the railway bridge at Bingen Hbf. Today, the Bingen Stadt Bnb signal box is protected as a monument. ==Location== Bingen (Rhein) Stadt station is two kilometres east of Bingen Hauptbahnhof, directly opposite the historic Rhine Crane and located in the centre of the town. The “town” station, through its adjoining bus station, has a better connection to the town’s bus network than the Hauptbahnhof. ==Platforms== Bingen (Rhein) Stadt station has four tracks on three platforms. The “home” platform on track 1 is served by MRB 32 services, running to Mainz Hauptbahnhof via Büdesheim (Bingen am Rhein), Gau- Algesheim, Ingelheim am Rhein, Heidesheim am Rhein, Heidenfahrt, Budenheim and Mainz-Mombach station. An underpass connects to the platform on tracks 2 and 3. Track 2 is served by trains towards Bingen Hauptbahnhof and continuing via Bacharach, Oberwesel, St. Goar and Boppard to Koblenz. Platform 3 serves only as an alternative track to allow the overtaking of slower trains. South of platform 1 is a bay platform with an extra platform. This platform is numbered 44. Platform 44 is used by the trains of the Rheinhessen Railway to Worms Hauptbahnhof via Gensingen-Horrweiler, Armsheim, Alzey and Monsheim. Platform 44 is the only platform that has been made accessible for the disabled. The other three platforms and the underpass are not accessible. ==Rail services== Bingen (Rhein) Stadt station is served only by regional services. It is served by the MittelrheinBahn (RB 26, Koblenz–Boppard–Bingen–Mainz) service operated by trans regio. The station is the beginning of services operated by DB Regio on the Rheinhessen Railway to Worms (RB 35). {  - class=\\"hintergrundfarbe6\\"  Line  Line name  Route  Frequency -   Mittelrheinbahn  Koblenz – Boppard – Oberwesel – Bingen (Rhein) Hbf – Bingen (Rhein) Stadt – Ingelheim – Mainz  Hourly -   Rheinhessenbahn  Worms – Monsheim – Alzey – Armsheim – Gau-Bickelheim – Gensingen-Horrweiler – Bingen (Rhein) Stadt  Hourly - } ==Notes== Category:Railway stations in Rhineland- Palatinate Category:Railway stations in Germany opened in 1859 ","title":"Bingen (Rhein) Stadt station"},{"id":"35889025","text":"Pheak Rady (born January 22, 1989) is a former Cambodian footballer who last played for Cambodian Tiger.

It is similar to the closeness centrality except that the farness is measured by the expected length of a random walk rather than by the shortest path. The concept was first proposed by White and Smyth (2003) under the name Markov centrality. == Intuition == Consider a network with a finite number of nodes and a random walk process that starts in a certain node and proceeds from node to node along the edges. From each node, it chooses randomly the edge to be followed. In an unweighted network, the probability of choosing a certain edge is equal across all available edges, while in a weighted network it is proportional to the edge weights. A node is considered to be close to other nodes, if the random walk process initiated from any node of the network arrives to this particular node in relatively few steps on average. == Definition == Consider a weighted network – either directed or undirected – with n nodes denoted by j=1, …, n; and a random walk process on this network with a transition matrix M. The m_{jk} element of M describes the probability of the random walker that has reached node i, proceeds directly to node j. These probabilities are defined in the following way. : M(i,j)=\\\\frac{a_{ij}}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}} where a_{ij} is the (i,j)th element of the weighting matrix A of the network. When there is no edge between two nodes, the corresponding element of the A matrix is zero. The random walk closeness centrality of a node i is the inverse of the average mean first passage time to that node: :C_{i}^{RWC} = \\\\frac{n}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^n H(j,i)} === Mean first passage time === The mean first passage time from node i to node j is the expected number of steps it takes for the process to reach node j from node i for the first time: : H(i,j)=\\\\sum_{r=1}^{\\\\infty} rP(i,j,r) where P(i,j,r) denotes the probability that it takes exactly r steps to reach j from i for the first time. To calculate these probabilities of reaching a node for the first time in r steps, it is useful to regard the target node as an absorbing one, and introduce a transformation of M by deleting its j-th row and column and denoting it by M_{-j}. As the probability of a process starting at i and being in k after r-1 steps is simply given by the (i,k)th element of M_{-j}^{r-1}, P(i,j,r) can be expressed as : P(i,j,r)=\\\\sum_{k eq j}((M_{-j}^{r-1}))_{ik} m_{kj} Substituting this into the expression for mean first passage time yields : H(i,j)=\\\\sum_{r=1}^{\\\\infty} r \\\\sum_{k eq j}((M_{-j}^{r-1}))_{ik} m_{kj} Using the formula for the summation of geometric series for matrices yields : H(i,j)=\\\\sum_{k eq j}((I-M_{-j})^{-2})_{ik} m_{kj} where I is the n-1 dimensional identity matrix. For computational convenience, this expression can be vectorized as : H(.,j)= (I-M_{-j})^{-1}e where H(.,j) is the vector for first passage times for a walk ending at node j, and e is an n-1 dimensional vector of ones. Mean first passage time is not symmetric, even for undirected graphs. == In model networks == According to simulations performed by Noh and Rieger (2004), the distribution of random walk closeness centrality in a Barabási-Albert model is mainly determined by the degree distribution. In such a network, the random walk closeness centrality of a node is roughly proportional to, but does not increase monotonically with its degree. == Applications for real networks == Random walk closeness centrality is more relevant measure than the simple closeness centrality in case of applications where the concept of shortest paths is not meaningful or is very restrictive for a reasonable assessment of the nature of the system. This is the case for example when the analyzed process evolves in the network without any specific intention to reach a certain point, or without the ability of finding the shortest path to reach its target. One example for a random walk in a network is the way a certain coin circulates in an economy: it is passed from one person to another through transactions, without any intention of reaching a specific individual. Another example where the concept of shortest paths is not very useful is a densely connected network. Furthermore, as shortest paths are not influenced by self- loops, random walk closeness centrality is a more adequate measure than closeness centrality when analyzing networks where self-loops are important. An important application on the field of economics is the analysis of the input-output model of an economy, which is represented by a densely connected weighted network with important self-loops.Blöchl F, Theis FJ, Vega-Redondo F, and Fisher E: Vertex Centralities in Input-Output Networks Reveal the Structure of Modern Economies, Physical Review E, 83(4):046127, 2011. The concept is widely used in natural sciences as well. One biological application is the analysis of protein-protein interactions.Aidong, Zhang: Protein Interaction Networks: Computational Analysis (Cambridge University Press) 2007 == Random walk betweenness centrality == A related concept, proposed by Newman,Newman, M.E. J.: A measure of betweenness centrality based on random walks. Social Networks, Volume 27, Issue 1, January 2005, Pages 39–54 is random walk betweenness centrality. Just as random walk closeness centrality is a random walk counterpart of closeness centrality, random walk betweenness centrality is, similarly, the random walk counterpart of betweenness centrality. Unlike the usual betweenness centrality measure, it does not only count shortest paths passing through the given node, but all possible paths crossing it. Formally, the random walk betweenness centrality of a node is :C_{i}^{RWB} = \\\\sum_{j eq i eq k} r_{jk} where the r_{jk} element of matrix R contains the probability of a random walk starting at node j with absorbing node k, passing through node i. Calculating random walk betweenness in large networks is computationally very intensive.Kang, U., Papadimitriou, S., Sun, J., and Tong, H.: Centralities in Large Networks: Algorithms and Observations. SIAM International Conference on Data Mining 2011, Mesa, Arizona, USA. == Second order centrality == Another random walk based centrality is the second order centrality.A.-M. Kermarrec, E. Le Merrer, B. Sericola, G. Trédan: Second order centrality: Distributed assessment of nodes criticity in complex networks. Elsevier Computer Communications 34(5):619-628, 2011. Instead of counting the shortest paths passing through a given node (as for random walk betweenness centrality), it focuses on another characteristic of random walks on graphs. The expectation of the standard deviation of the return times of a random walk to a node constitutes its centrality. The lower that deviation, the more central that node is. Calculating the second order betweenness on large arbitrary graphs is also intensive, as its complexity is O(n^3) (worst case achieved on the Lollipop graph). == See also == * Centrality == References == Category:Graph theory ","title":"Random walk closeness centrality"},{"id":"35889137","text":"Vallabhbhai G Kakadiya is a Member of Legislative assembly from Thakkarbapa Nagar constituency in Gujarat for its 12th, 13th and 14th legislative assembly.

As its name suggests, this bee inhabits forests in warm tropical climates and constructs nests by burrowing into wood. It often makes long deep tunnels in wooden rafters, fallen trees, telephone poles and the like, but is not found in living trees.Jones, Richard. (2006). Bibliography of Commonwealth Apiculture. . 190. It was first scientifically described by the English entomologist, Dru Drury in 1773, and is a member of the group of solitary bees (Family Apidae). The tropical carpenter bee is a very large, robust, solitary bee. It is shiny, fully black in colour with fuscous metallic blue-green or purple wings in sunlight. The tropical carpenter bee is probably the largest Xylocopa known and among the largest bees of the world (though it is not the world's largest, that title belongs to another Southeast Asian bee, the Indonesian Megachile pluto). It has a loud and distinctive, low-pitched buzzing that can be heard as it flies between flowers or perches. In Urban areas, these bees can become attached to certain perches, returning to them day after day, even after several generations. ==Mating== Carpenter bees mate on-the-wing. Males grasp the females in flight and place their front or middle legs, which have fringes of long setae, over the compound eyes of their mate. It is thought that the dilated front legs of males of some species of carpenter bees collect and trap oils and odours that function during mating.Wittman, D. and B. Blochtein. (1995). “Why males of leafcutter bees hold the females’ antennae with their front legs during mating”. Apidologie 26, 181-195. Xylocopa latipes are considered multivoltine as they can have more than two generations per year but this depends on the availability of floral resources in their habitat.Solomon, A. J. Raju, and S. Purnachandra Rao. (2006). \\"Nesting habits, floral resources and foraging ecology of large carpenter bees (Xylocopa latipes and Xylocopa pubescens) in India\\". CURRENT SCIENCE, VOL. 90, NO. 9, 1210. ==Nesting== In Malaysia, tropical carpenter bees often choose useful structural woods as nesting sites, as they are able to burrow through it with their powerful mandibles. Tropical carpenter bees construct multiple galleries (3 - 5) of about 11 cm in length and 2.1 - 2.3 cm in diameter.Mardan, M., Yatim, Ismail, M. and Raji Khalid, Mohd. (1991). “Nesting Biology and Foraging Activity of Carpenter Bee on Passion Fruit”. Acta Hort. (ISHS) 288: 127-132 . Tropical carpenter bees choose dead wood, pithy stems and bamboo culms for nesting. Preferred wood species for the tropical carpenter bee include, Syzygium cumini, Cassia siamea, Dyera costulata (jelutong), Agathis alba (damar minyak), Alstonia spp. (pulai), and Shorea spp. (light-red meranti). They tend to avoid nyatoh, kapur, kempas, and mengkulang (local names for native trees of Malaysia).Robinson, William H. “Handbook of Urban Insects and Arachnids”. 227 ==Role in Pollination== Carpenter bees are used commercially in the Philippines to pollinate passion-fruit flowers. They naturally perform the same function in Indonesia and Malaysia and the rest of Southeast Asia. In addition, passion-fruit flowers (Passiflora edulis flavicarpa) have been found to bloom in synchrony with tropical carpenter bee foraging rhythms, indicating an evolving relationship between the two species. ==References== latipes Category:Hymenoptera of Asia Category:Insects of Indonesia Category:Insects of Laos Category:Insects of Malaysia Category:Insects of Thailand Category:Insects of Vietnam Category:Insects of Myanmar Category:Insects of Cambodia Category:Insects of Singapore Category:Fauna of Southeast Asia Category:Insects described in 1773 Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Xylocopa latipes"},{"id":"35889153","text":"Scott McGrew (born September 26, 1967 in Lincoln, Nebraska) is an American reporter on television and radio.

Kodnani joined the 12th legislative assembly of Gujarat after being elected to represent the constituency of Naroda as a candidate for the Bharatiya Janata Party. In 2012, Kodnani was sentenced to twenty-eight years' imprisonment for her participation in the Naroda Patiya massacre during the 2002 Gujarat riots but acquitted in 2018 by the Gujarat High Court. Kodnani was one of the most high-profile individuals to be convicted in the case, as well being the only woman among the accused. ==Early life== Kodnani is the daughter of a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker who moved to India during the Indian Partition. She had her early education in a Gujarati-medium school. She also joined Rashtra Sevika Samiti, the parallel organisation of RSS for women. Kodnani joined the Baroda Medical College from where she did her MBBS and Diploma in Gynaecology and Obstetrics. She set up Shivam Maternity Hospital at Kubernagar in Naroda, Ahmedabad. ==Political career== Kodnani began her political career with Ahmedabad civic elections in 1995. She was elected three times from the Naroda constituency as a Member of the Legislative Assembly for the BJP. In 1998, she won the election with a margin of 75,000 votes. In December 2002, shortly after 2002 Gujarat riots, she won by a margin of 110,000 votes. In 2007, her margin increased 180,000 votes. After winning the elections in 2007, she was named as Minister for Women and Child Development of Gujarat in Narendra Modi's BJP government, but resigned from the post in 2009 impending her arrest as accused for the Naroda Patiya massacre. ==Role in the 2002 Gujarat riots== Kodnani was convicted of orchestrating the Naroda Gam and Naroda Patiya massacres of the 2002 Gujarat riots on 28 February 2002, in which 97 Muslims, including 36 women and 35 children, were murdered by stabbing, dismemberment and being burned alive individually as well as in groups. Witnesses testified that Kodnani was at the scene of the crimes, handed out swords to Hindu rioters, exhorted them to attack Muslims and at one point fired a pistol. Bajrang Dal members Suresh Richard and Prakash Rathod told Tehelka's journalists on spy camera that Kodnani drove around Naroda all day, urging the mob to hunt Muslims down and kill them. Mobile phone records also placed her at the scene and showed her to be in regular communication with the top police officials, the Home Minister Gordhan Zadaphia and the Chief Minister's office. The mobile phone records were buried by the police and brought to light by the Nanavati- Mehta Commission in 2004. They were later investigated by R. K. Raghavan-led Special Investigation Team (SIT) appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2008. Kodnani ignored notices for deposition by the SIT, which declared her an absconder in February 2009. She obtained an anticipatory bail from a sessions court, which was revoked by the Gujarat High Court on 27 March 2009, leading to her subsequent arrest. She was tried in the Naroda Patiya massacre case and, on 31 August 2012, convicted of murder and conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to 28 years in prison. The court judgement called her the \\"kingpin of the Naroda Patiya massacre.\\" Kodnani continued to maintain her innocence, claiming that she was at the Sola Civil Hospital at the time of the riots, meeting the relatives of Godhra victims. On 17 April 2013, the Gujarat government filed an appeal in the High Court seeking the death penalty for Kodnani but withdrew it on 14 May. In November 2013, she was granted an interim bail of three months for treatment of intestinal tuberculosis.

Elizabeth Bott's hypothesis holds that the connectedness or the density of a husband's and wife's separate social networks is positively associated with marital role segregation.Michael Gordon and Helen Downing. 1978. A Multivariate Test of the Bott Hypothesis in an Urban Irish Setting, Journal of Marriage and Family, Vol. 40, Nr. 3, pp. 585-593. ==Family Structure and Social Networks== In her Family and Social Network (1957), Elizabeth Bott argued that conjugal role performance is related to the density of each spouse's social networks outside the nuclear family. The data Bott used to develop this hypothesis were drawn from the study of 20 working-class, London families. Thus, according to Bott: Elizabeth Bott. 1971. Family and Social Network (2nd ed.). (Originally published, 1957). New York:Free Press. In other words, what she claimed is that if family members maintain ties with a network of friends or neighbors who know one another and interact apart from the family members, the members of these external social networks can develop norm consensus and exert pressure on the network's members. When members of close-knit networks marry and when they continue to be drawn into network activities after marriage, they can develop a clearly differentiated conjugal role organization of tasks. The external close-knit networks provide the spouses with instrumental assistance and emotional support outside the couple and they, thus, lessen conjugal interdependence and make for a segregated role organization.Joan Aldous and Murray A. Straus. 1966. Social Networks and Conjugal Roles: A Test of Bott's Hypothesis, Social Forces, Vol. 44, No. 4, pp. 576-580. ==Corollary Hypotheses== To support her main hypothesis, Bott also offered three corollary hypotheses:Alexandra Maryansky and Masako Ishii-Kuntz. 1991. A Cross-Species Application Of Bott's Hypothesis on Role Segregation and Social Networks, Sociological Perspectives, Vol. 34, No. 4, pp. 403-425. * The Class Principle. The more segregated the role-relationship, the more likely spouses are to have working-class status and less formal education. (For Bott, working class status was a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for segregated role performance) * The Composition Principle. The more segregated the role- relationship, the more likely females are to have locally concentrated relatives in their network and the more likely males are to have locally concentrated male friends in their network. * The Residential Principle. The more segregated the role-relationship, the more likely couples are to have a stable residence pattern. Conversely, the more joint the role relationship, the more likely spouses are to have a mobile residence pattern. Considered by some as one of the predecessors of network science, Bott recognized the fact that, although important, individual attributes cannot explain all the variations in family relations. Instead, she claimed that the social environment which can be visualized as a network rather than as a group can affect conjugal roles. In particular, the density of a network (the proportion of individuals with direct ties to each other) facilitates the emergence of common norms and social support making husbands and wives less likely to invest in each other. ==Further ResearchUdry and Hall (1965)=== Udry and Hall (1965) tested the Bott hypothesis by using a sample of 43 middle-aged, middle-class couples, and the four people each spouse indicated most frequent contact with. However, they did not find a clear-cut relationship between role segregation and network connectedness (measured by asking members of each spouse's network how well they knew each other). Thus, they conclude that Bott's hypothesis may apply only to lower-class couples, or perhaps to middle- class couples at a particular point in the life cycle.Udry, J. Richard and Mary Hall. 1965. Marital role segregation and social networks in middle-class middle-aged couples, Journal of Marriage and the Family, Vol. 27, pp. 392- 395. ===Joel Nelson (1966)=== Joel Nelson (1966) used a sample of 131 working- class women in New Haven and asked the women to list the four people they interacted with most frequently and how often they saw at least two of them at the same time. He introduced the term \\"clique\\" contacts for those who had interactions of the latter type at least once a week. Analyzing the influence of the closeness of clique relationships on members' attitudes toward marriage on a traditionalism-modernism dimension, he found the first to be related to marital traditionalism, though not strongly. Thus, women with \\"clique\\" relationships were found to have more traditional marital expectations and attitudes than their counterparts whose network contacts were more \\"individualistic\\". ===Aldous and Straus (1966)=== Aldous and Straus (1966) studied 391 married women living on farms and in towns of at least 2,500 inhabitants. The town group was separated into those with blue and white- collar husbands and the respondents were asked to name the eight women they socialized with most frequently and how many of the eight knew each other in order to measure network closure. Besides network connectedness, several other indexes were devised for measuring task differentiation, sex role activities and power. Although the data failed to confirm the Bott hypothesis, Aldous and Straus note that their sample may have been problematic since there was little variation in network connectedness, they did not know if the wives' social networks were developed before of after their marriages, and there was no data concerning the husbands' social networks. ===Alexandra Maryansky and Masako Ishii-Kuntz (1991)=== Alexandra Maryansky and Masako Ishii-Kuntz (1991) find evidence that supports Elizabeth Bott's hypothesis by applying it to a review of social relations among representative species from seven genera of Old World primates. After formalizing and stating Bott's theory more abstractly they highlight three phenomena concerning the effect of social networks: * the negative causal effect of network overlap on density of each actor's networks; * the positive causal effect of network density on the degree of social support provided by, and a normative elaboration of, each actor's networks; * the causal effect of social support and normative elaboration on the segregation of each actor's activities. ==References== Category:Sociological theories ","title":"Bott Hypothesis"},{"id":"35889305","text":"Paulo dos Santos (born 14 April 1960) is a Brazilian former footballer who played as a midfielder.

Sedans had new rear styling with vertical taillights. Wagons and utilities carried over the rear lights and panels from their AP6 predecessors, with wagons receiving the new rear bumper and utilities carrying over the previous models bumperettes. The VC range displayed a greater degree of differentiation between models with the Valiant, Regal and V8 each having unique exterior decoration and trim.Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1987, page 96 Regal and V8 models had a chrome strip situated near the lower edge of the doors and V8 models featured a vinyl roof, bucket seats and a floor mounted gear selector with full length centre console, as well as V8 badges on the rear roof pillar, bootlid, bonnet emblem and hubcaps. V8 sedans also featured three horizontal chrome bars on the rear quarter panel.

Network formation hypotheses are tested by using either a dynamic model with an increasing network size or by making an agent- based model to determine which network structure is the equilibrium in a fixed-size network. ==Dynamic models== A dynamic model, often used by physicists and biologists, begins as a small network or even a single node. The modeler then uses a (usually randomized) rule on how newly arrived nodes form links in order to increase the size of the network. The aim is to determine what the properties the network will be when it grows in size. In this way, researchers try to reproduce properties common in most real networks, such as the small world network property or the scale-free network property. These properties are common in almost every real network including the World Wide Web, the metabolic network or the network of international air routes. The oldest model of this type is the Erdős-Rényi model, in which new nodes randomly choose other nodes to connect to. A second well-known model is the Watts and Strogatz model, which starts from a standard two-dimensional lattice and evolves by replacing links randomly. These models display some realistic network properties, but fail to account for others. One of the most influential models of network formation is the Barabási-Albert model. Here, the network also starts from a small system, and incoming nodes choose their links randomly, but the randomization is not uniform. Instead, nodes which already possess a greater number of links will have a higher likelihood of becoming connected to incoming nodes. This mechanism is known as preferential attachment. In comparison to previous models, the Barabbas-Albert model seems to more accurately reflect phenomena observed in real-world networks. ==Agent- based models== The second approach to model network formation is agent- or game theory-based modelling. In these models, a network with fixed number of nodes or agents is created. Every agent is given utility function, a representation of its linking preferences, and directed to form links with other nodes based upon it. Usually, forming or maintaining a link will have a cost, but having connections to other nodes will have benefits. The method tests the hypothesis that, given some initial setting and parameter values, a certain network structure will emerge as an equilibrium of this game. Since the number of nodes usually fixed, they can very rarely explain the properties of huge real-world networks; however, they are very useful to examine the network formation in smaller groups. Jackson and Wolinsky pioneered these types of models in a 1996 paper, which has since inspired several game- theoretic models. These models were further developed by Jackson and Watts, who put this approach to a dynamic setting to see how the network structure evolve over time. Usually, games with known network structure are widely applicable; however, there are various settings when players interact without fully knowing who their neighbors are and what the network structure is. These games can be modeled using incomplete information network games. ==Growing networks in agent-based setting== There are very few models that try to combine the two approaches. However, in 2007, Jackson and Rogers modeled a growing network in which new nodes chose their connections partly based on random choices and partly based on maximizing their utility function. With this general framework, modelers can reproduce almost every stylized trait of real-life networks. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Network theory ","title":"Network formation"},{"id":"35889571","text":"Empress Yang may refer to: *Empress Yang Yan (238–274), empress of the Jin Dynasty *Empress Yang Zhi (259–292), empress of the Jin Dynasty and Yang Yan's cousin. *Yang Xianrong (died 322), empress of Emperor Hui of Jin and Liu Yao of Han Zhao in ancient China *Empress Yang (Former Qin) (died 386), empress of the Chinese/Di state Former Qin *Empress Yang (Lü Zuan's wife) (died 401), empress of the Chinese/Di state Later Liang *Empress Yang (Lü Long's wife), empress of the Chinese/Di state Later Liang *Yang Lihua (561–609), empress of the Chinese/Xianbei dynasty Northern Zhou *Empress Yang (Song Dynasty) (1162–1232), wife of Emperor Ningzong of Song ==See also== *Consort Yang (disambiguation) Yang ","title":"Empress Yang"},{"id":"35889582","text":"The historical-ethnographic museum in Khinalug village () is a museum that was established in 2001 by residents of the Khinalug village.

He participated in the Peninsula Campaign under Maj. Gen. Magruder. ==Killed in action== Jemison was killed on July 1, 1862, at the Battle of Malvern Hill. The circumstances of his death will likely never be fully known, though a popular story emerged of a direct hit from a cannonball which decapitated him. The cause of his death has since been called into question. The death by cannon fire story was corroborated by the 1887 obituary of his younger brother, Sam, but incorrectly identifies the battle as First Manassas. Biographer Alexandra Filipowski debunks the tale altogether. A veteran named Captain Moseley told the gruesome story of the decapitation to crowds all over the south, often for money. At one such event, Jemison’s brother was in attendance and drew his own conclusion, stating “that was my brother.” It has since been shown, however, that Moseley did not fight at Malvern Hill and could not have witnessed Private Jemison’s demise. Filipowski cites Jemison’s obituary as the only actual known account of his death: “He sustain[ed] himself in the front rank of the soldier and gentlemen until the moment of his death. Bounding forward at the order ‘Charge!’ he was stricken down in the front rank, and without a struggle yielded up his young life.” Following the Battle of Malvern Hill, both sides buried their dead on the battlefield. After the American Civil War, organizations like the United Daughters of the Confederacy returned to the old battlefields and disinterred the bodies of fallen Confederate soldiers and gave them proper burials in places like the Confederate Section of Hollywood Cemetery in nearby Richmond, Virginia. It is thought that Jemison's parents erected the monument to him at Memory Hill Cemetery in Milledgeville, Georgia, where he may be buried. Most believe that he was buried on or near the Malvern Hill battlefield in Henrico County, Virginia, in an unmarked grave. ==Legacy== Jemison's photograph has become one of the most famous and iconic portraits of the young soldiers of both the Confederate and Union armies. It was featured particularly on the cover of Soviet magazine Amerika in 1991 (issue 418). ==See also== *Johnny Reb *List of iconic photographs ==ReferencesNPS Soldier Database entry * Private Edwin Jemison: The Boy Soldier Category:1844 births Category:1862 deaths Category:Burials in the United States Category:Confederate States Army soldiers Category:Confederate States military personnel killed in the American Civil War Category:People from Milledgeville, Georgia Category:People notable for being the subject of a specific photograph Category:People of Georgia (U.S. state) in the American Civil War Category:Child soldiers Category:Photographs of children in war ","title":"Edwin Francis Jemison"},{"id":"35889672","text":"Piszczek () is a Polish surname which is most frequent in the cities of Kraków and Nowy Targ in south central and Piła and Złotów in north west Poland and is also to be found among the Polish diaspora.

The modeling paradigm uses five symbols to model any process and allows direct transformation into executable form. Each business process consists of two or more subjects which exchange messages. Each subject has an internal behavior (capsulation), which is defined as a control flow between different states, which are receive and send message and do something. For practical usage and for syntactical sugaring there are more elements available, but not necessary. In 2011 and 2012 S-BPM has been included in Gartner's Hype Cycle. == Foundations  Process calculi === The S-BPM methodology in its essence is based on the CCS-Calculus of Robin Milner. The main objective of CCS was to provide a mathematical framework to describe communicating systems in a formal way. Milner states that every interesting concurrent system is built from independent agents which communicate in a synchronized way. So the objects whose behaviors are modeled are called agents. An agent can be seen as a term for a locus of activity, a process, or a computational unit. The agent's behavior is defined by the action it can perform and represented using algebraic expressions. The notion of agent corresponds in principle with the notion of subject in S-BPM. The basic capabilities of an agent (or subject) are * sending a message * receiving a message, and * performing an unobservable action. The idea of using the CCS- Calculus to model business processes was firstly proposed in 1994 in the context of Subject oriented programming. Further on, the CCS-Calculus was enhanced to support graphical modeling of business processes. Any S-BPM process can be formulated in CCS-algebra. Later Milner et al. proposed the π-Calculus as process algebra, in general an enhancement of the CCS-Calculus with the so-called link-mobility. π-Calculus was strongly proposed by Smith and Fingar as foundation for business process management and led to some discussions about future directions for research and development. The search for new methodologies is motivated by the demand to better support human collaboration and communication in business processes (e.g. ad hoc processes, empowerment, human interaction workflows), which seems to be not well supported by methodologies based on e.g. Petri-nets. === Abstract State Machines === S-BPM can also be formulated as Abstract state machine. A high- level subject-oriented interpreter model for the semantics of the S-BPM constructs has been published by Egon Börger. This definition is the starting point for the development of an Open S-BPM Workflow Engine (see Research & Education). Today there is a tool — cloud OS Corezoid.com. Which operates on the basis of the theory of finite automata. Its main elements are the abstract state machines, which describe the status of objects in the system. Each of these new states generate new essential processes and vice versa. === Formal language === The S-BPM methodology can be linked conceptually to the field of formal language theory as any process can be described in natural language which can be mapped during the design process on formal language as a first step of formalization. In many natural languages, subject, predicate and object are the basic building blocks of a sentence. The subject of a sentence is the person, place, thing, or idea that is carrying out the action denoted by the predicate. A predicate has at its center a simple predicate, which is always the verb or verbs linked to the subject. The direct object is the person or thing that receives the action of the verb. It normally follows the verb. The indirect object is the person or thing to whom or to which the action was directed or for whom or for which the action was performed. The indirect object is in a way the recipient of the direct object. In the requirements engineering process people typically describe their requirements, expectations or how they do work, typically, in full sentences (if not, sentences could always be reduced or enhanced to have such a normal form). That means, any statement can be expresses as a sentence with subject, object, and predicate. In S-BPM notation this can be mapped as follows: * subject (who) → subject * object (with what) → data (business object) * predicate (what) → action Subjects execute actions on objects. Nevertheless, further research seems to be needed on this topic, but it helps to explain the concept and idea behind S-BPM and it is a well explored didactical method in teaching. A comprehensive description of the S-BPM notation can be found in === Subject vs. Agent === To be more precise, the relation of agent and subject is not a simple one to one match. Here, the term subject denotes a process-related functionality and agent denotes a real thing or instance (i.e. a concrete realisation of a subject). This is important, because subjects have to be matched with organisational structures (i.e. the resources of an organisation, such as people or machines). This differentiation is therefore important in the context of concrete implementations of the S-BPM methodology in an organisation - with or without the support of information technology. On the other hand, the term agent has many meanings in different domains, e.g. in economics, linguistics, social sciences or computer science. Sometimes the term actor is synonymously used. Care must be taken, not to mix up different meanings. == Example == A simple S-BPM model of a business process (quiz): internal behaviour of a subject. The basic concepts can be explained with the help of a simple example, the process of doing a quiz. This includes all elements of S-BPM: two subjects (person who asks, person who answers), three messages/objects (question, answer to question, and feedback, if answer is correct or not). This example is very basic, but has been developed for didactical purposes and can be enhanced to more complex behaviors (e.g. there is no answer that would leave the asker in an indefinite state and must be considered in modeling). A simple S-BPM model of a business process (quiz): subject view. == Research & Education == The nonprofit organization Institute of Innovative Processmanagement (I2PM) serves as community platform to bundle research and development activities in the field of S-BPM, e.g. the Open S-BPM initiative (http://www.i2pm.net/interest-groups/open-s-bpm). The I2PM supports and stimulates the improvement of existing and the development of new tertiary curricula in the domain of business process management. Since 2009 I2PM organizes the yearly scientific conference S-BPM ONE. S-BPM has been applied and tested in a number of fields, including the production industry. == References  * Institute of Innovative Process Management (http://www.I2PM.net) * S-BPM ONE (http://www.s-bpm-one.com); Proceedings: https://www.springer.com * IANES (Interactive Acquisition, Negotiation and Enactment of Subject-oriented business process knowledge) addresses the requirement of in-situ process knowledge acquisition and alignment.

It was commonly known as the Rank Charm School. ==History== The Company of Youth was a conscious attempt by J. Arthur Rank to manufacture stars similar to the Hollywood studio system. He was also inspired by the success Gainsborough Pictures had in developing British stars such as Stewart Granger, James Mason, Patricia Roc and Phyllis Calvert. Producer Sydney Box originally set up a Company of Youth at Riverside Studios in December 1945.Variety January 1946 p 5, 19 Box put half a dozen young actors under contract and placed them in bit roles while they learnt their craft. Box transferred the company to Gainsborough in 1946 when he was recruited by the Rank Organisation. The school was based at the church hall next to Rank's \\"B picture\\" studio at Highbury in London. Students were given an allowance of around £10 a week and trained in breathing, deportment, movement and mime, fencing, accent correction, play reading, script study, rehearsing of excerpts, remedial exercises, and diction. One writer described it as \\"a sort of cross between Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio and a London finishing school for young ladies\\".Geoffrey MacNab, J. Arthur Rank and the British Film Industry, Routledge 1994 p141 accessed 21 May 2012 The school's main acting teacher was Molly Terraine with Olive Dodds the administrator.

Green remained a bachelor throughout his life, making his home in a disused drainage mill at Hickling in Norfolk. He set many of his bird paintings in the Broads, capturing some of the wild beauty of this region in his distinctive style. Roland Green was born in Rainham, Kent, the son of a taxidermist, who trained him in the skinning, stuffing and setting up birds, thereby instilling an extensive knowledge of anatomy and plumage. He showed an early aptitude for drawing and painting birds. Educated in Rochester and at the Regent Street Polytechnic, he was a skilled bird and mammal painter, holding annual exhibitions of his paintings and etchings. The subjects of his etchings were snipe, Canada geese, mallard and kingfishers. He also gave lectures on bird watching and the drawing of birds, with an emphasis on birds in flight. He spent a great deal of time in the reedbeds, creating the mistaken impression of being unsociable, but his talks to pupils at various schools dispelled that notion.Keys Auctions Green was commissioned by Lord Desborough of Hickling Estate in Norfolk to paint a frieze at Whiteslea Lodge, showing the birds of Hickling Broad.http://www.britishbirdsinart.co.uk/artists ==Works illustrated by Green== *The Birds of Australia – Gregory Mathews (Witherby: London, 1910–27) *Birds in Flight – William Plane Pycraft (Gay & Hancock, London, 1922) *Birds and their Young – Thomas Coward (Gay & Hancock: London, 1923) *Wing To Wing – Bird Watching Adventures at Home and Abroad with the R.A.F. – E.H.

The Liffey has a modern catchment area of which has been modified by human activity, specifically diversion for irrigation. Flow is highly seasonal with the largest average monthly flows from July to September. The flow, and effective catchment area, are affected by irrigation diversion. Excess flow from the Cressy-Longford irrigation scheme is diverted into the river increasing summer flow in the river's lower reaches. This irrigation diversion originates at the Poatina Hydroelectric Power Station's tailrace and enters the river near Bracknell. Though the upper hills are known for their cool temperate rainforest, land along most of the river's length is used for agriculture. Water quality in the lower reaches is affected by agricultural run-off and for a small length by discharge from a sewerage plant at Carrick. The plant, which also handles sewerage from nearby Hadspen, discharges treated waste-water into a tributary of the Liffey. The river was originally known as Tellerpangger by the aboriginal inhabitants of the area, the Panninher clan of the North Midlands Nation. Upon British occupation it was renamed Penny Royal Creek, after a plant that grew profusely on its banks, and the Panninher became known as the Pennyroyal Creek Tribe. William Bryan, an early settler in Carrick, used his influence to rename the river during the early 19th century, after the River Liffey in his homeland Ireland. ==Bridges== The Liffey River—then called Pennyroyal Creek—was first bridged at Carrick in 1828 with a simple log structure. This was replaced in the 1830s with a more substantial bridge, though still wooden. Liffey bridge was repaired and raised in the mid-1860s, keeping the original foundations. In May 1875 water sufficiently eroded these foundations to lead to the bridge's collapse, when one of the two supporting piles (logs) gave way. All of the Liffey bridges, and the connecting parts of the road, were subject to inundation when the river flooded; the 1929 Tasmanian Floods carried the bridge away. In the 1950s the road was reconstructed and the bridge again replaced. To reduce the incidence and impact of flooding both were raised substantially leaving the nearby Carrick Mill's ground floor far below the road level. ==Flora and fauna== The upper river is surrounded by cool temperate rainforest. The Liffey is fished for brown trout (Salmo trutta) during the August to April fishing season. Trout were first introduced into the river in 1870, near the same time there were releases in the Meander River. Trout were again released into the river by the fisheries commission in 1940,The Mercury, Brown Trout Liberated, Tuesday 9 April 1940, page 6 and by 1949 specimens of up to had been caught in the river's upper reaches. Apart from introduced brown trout the Liffey River is home to platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus). Platypus in the river have, in common with in other rivers nearby, been found with the potentially lethal fungal infection Mucor amphiborum. ==See also== *Liffey Valley Reserve *List of rivers of Tasmania ==References== Category:Rivers of Tasmania Category:Northern Tasmania ","title":"Liffey River (Tasmania)"},{"id":"35890215","text":"Marceli Konrad Strzykalski (born 19 February 1931) is a Polish former footballer who competed in the 1960 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1931 births Category:Living people Category:Association football midfielders Category:Polish footballers Category:Olympic footballers of Poland Category:Poland international footballers Category:Footballers at the 1960 Summer Olympics Category:Legia Warsaw players Category:Sportspeople from Ruda Śląska ","title":"Marceli Strzykalski"},{"id":"35890217","text":"Polygonum cognatum, commonly called Indian knotgrass or madimak (from Turkish madımakProf. Dr. Turhan Baytop (1997), Türkçe Bitki Adları Sözlüğü, TDK yayınları: 578, Ankara, 1997), is an edible weedy creeping perennial herb in the genus Polygonum, frequently eaten by people of Turkey.

A contract was drawn up in 1620 by Jacobus Tirinus and the paintings were delivered a year later in time for the consecration. Rubens received 7,000 guilders for his works in the church, and though the lavish decorations including sculptures and other artwork were well received, Tirinus was dismissed in 1625 for going beyond his budget. In 1718 the vault of the nave, including Rubens' ceiling paintings, was destroyed by fire. Jan Pieter van Baurscheidt the Elder restored the damaged parts according to the original plan, but replaced the original coffers with wide transverse arches. In 1773 the Society of Jesus was suppressed and the building was confiscated. It reopened in 1779, renamed St.-Carolus Borromeuskerk, after Charles Borromeo. Since 1803 the St.-Carolus Borromeuskerk has been in use as a parish church.

They are a trio of anthropomorphic, mutant toad space warriors fighting against the wicked Dark Queen's forces to save the universe. They also appeared in some other media and have gained a sizable fan following. == Appearances In the Battletoads games=== According to the games' backstory, the Battletoads were originally human computer technicians and roommates. The trio tested the original Battletoads game by playing the game as the 'Toads in a sort of virtual reality simulation. They became suspicious of both their boss and chief game programmer Silas Volkmire and decided to investigate the office at night. Upon finding the video game unit turned on, they tested it to see if it had been tampered with. This was a trap and they were transported to another planet, permanently transformed into the Battletoads. When the evil Dark Queen attempted to destroy the 'Toads upon their arrival, they fought their way to freedom with the assistance of Professor T. Bird, who became the 'Toads' friend and mentor. The 'Toads then decided to never rest until the Dark Queen is defeated once and for all. Each Battletoad has the ability to fight enemies with punches and kicks, as well as transform their limbs into different objects. They can also use various objects as weapons and pilot machines.  Rash  Rash (Dave Shar) is the \\"cool cat\\" of the 'Toads. He is an extrovert and a show-off and loves to crack puns. Rash is the smallest but the fastest and most agile of the 'Toads. He always wears his trademark sunglasses and spiked black kneepads. In early artwork he was presented wearing red armbands, but these armbands were never visible in any of the games, and by Battletoads/Double Dragon the armbands had been eliminated entirely, though they were restored in his Killer Instinct appearance. His profile in Battletoads Arcade reveals his height to be 6' 3\\". Rash's skin has changed in appearance once at the beginning of the series. He began with a medium shade of green, just like the other two 'Toads, and appears that way on the original game's box art for the NES (with dark spots in the Sega Genesis version). In every game he appears in, his skin is a bright green. Rash has appeared in every Battletoads game, though not always as a playable character. He was player one's character in the original Battletoads game but was out of action in Battletoads for the Game Boy due to being kidnapped prior to the game's opening. He returned to action as player two's character in Battletoads in Battlemaniacs and continued on as a playable character in Battletoads/Double Dragon and Battletoads Arcade.  Pimple  Pimple (George Pie) is the muscle of the 'Toads and prefers to fight instead of talk. Pimple is the largest and strongest 'Toad. He wears spiked black kneepads and spiked black arm braces. Early artwork depicted him wearing a spiked black belt, but he was never seen wearing this belt in any of the games and later artwork eliminated the belt. According to his profile in the arcade Battletoads, he stands at a height of 7'4\\". Pimple's skin has changed in appearance a few times over the course of the series. He began with a medium shade of green, just like the other two 'Toads, and appears that way on the original box art. In the first game itself his skin was a darker shade of green, matching Rash but not Zitz. His skin was later changed to a light tan before finally being presented with a brown color for his skin, which is now considered his official skin color. He appears with his current color in Battletoads/Double Dragon and Battletoads Arcade. Pimple has appeared in every Battletoads game, but not always as a playable character. He was out of action in both the original Battletoads game and Battletoads for the Game Boy, having been kidnapped prior to the start of both games. His first appearance as a playable character was in Battletoads in Battlemaniacs in which he was player one's character. He continued to be a playable character in Battletoads/Double Dragon and Battletoads Arcade and is immediately selectable in both games.  Zitz  Zitz (Morgan Ziegler) is the leader of the 'Toads. He is a tactical genius and an economical fighter, preferring fighting methods that allow him to conserve his strength. Zitz has a larger build and is slightly taller than Rash, and is the smartest of the three. He is always seen wearing black gauntlets (the arcade Battletoads revealed his gauntlets to contain video communication hardware), spiked black kneepads and a black belt with the 'Toads' insignia on the buckle. According to his profile in the arcade Battletoads, he stands at a height of 6' 8\\". Zitz's skin has changed in appearance several times over the course of the series. He began with a medium shade of green, just like the other two 'Toads, and appears that way on the original box art. In the first game itself his skin was actually tan to tell him apart from Player 1 (Rash). His skin was later changed to a lighter green with hints of yellow (he appeared to be an olive green in Battletoads in Battlemaniacs), before he was finally presented with a cool bluish-green color for his skin in Battletoads/Double Dragon and Battletoads Arcade. Zitz has appeared in every Battletoads game, though not always as a playable character. He was player two's character in the original Battletoads game and took on the Dark Queen's army solo in Battletoads for the Game Boy. Due to a surprise ambush he was knocked unconscious and taken prisoner just prior to the beginning of Battletoads in Battlemaniacs and thus was not playable in that game. He returned to action in Battletoads/Double Dragon and Battletoads Arcade and is immediately selectable in both games. ===In other media=== A Battletoads cartoon series was pitched to networks, but only a pilot episode was ever produced, written by David Wise. In the pilot, the trio are junior high school teenagers who are video game enthusiasts and self-described \\"biggest losers in the universe\\". Suddenly, Professor T. Bird and Princess Angelica from the Planet Cagellian emerge from the arcade game star Wars. Angelica asks them to become \\"the most legendary warriors in the universe\\" and join her, and Professor T. Bird then uses his \\"toad essence\\" to transform \\"the three nerds\\" into the Battletoads against the arriving Dark Queen and her forces. At the end of the fight, Angelica gives them their Battletoads names. A comic preview of the pilot by Francis Mao was printed in GamePro magazine.GamePro issue 47 (June 1993) pages 48-49. All three Battletoads also appear in a few comic strips published in Nintendo Power. They make a guest appearance in the Xbox One and PC versions of the 2014 platform game Shovel Knight. The Battletoads appear in Ready Player One. They are among the avatars that take part in the Battle of Castle Anorak. Rash alone appears as a guest character in the 2016 fighting game Killer Instinct: Season Three. He has the ability to use several of his abilities from the Battletoads games, including his run, smash hits, and a speeder bike. He was made available in Killer Instinct to all Rare Replay owners for a limited test period prior to the official public launch of Season Three. ==Reception== The Battletoads have been well-received, achieving an iconic status during the early 1990s. According to Computer and Video Games article \\"Toads V Turtles\\" in 1991, \\"There's no doubt about it - the Toads have moved into Turtle territory a big way, and seem certain to give our pizza munching heroes a serious run for their money.\\"Computer and Video Games issue 120 (November 1991). That same year, Raze declared: \\"In the US, the Battletoads are to Nintendo what Christian Slater is to film. These green-backs are the coolest, raddest, most laidback creatures to ever appear on the streets. Put simply, these guys make the Turtles look like pond scum.\\" Pimple was included in GamesRadar's 2015 list of \\"the '90s raddest gaming mascots\\" as one of the era's \\"brightest stars\\". Retrospectively, the Battletoads were dubbed the \\"least terrible Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles rip-off\\" by Topless Robot in 2008. In 2011, Complex included their boot-to-the-face finishing move the fourth craziest video game Fatality, adding that \\"inventing the curb stomp LONG before Edward Norton in American History X, the Battletoads [...] may have been knock-offs of the Ninja Turtles, but they definitely kicked more ass.\\" That same year, Complex ranked them at fifth place on the list of \\"really ugly good guys\\", adding that \\"even their names are ugly.\\" In 2012, the Battletoads placed have been at the 81st spot on GamesRadar's list of top 100 \\"most memorable, influential, and badass protagonists in games\\". According to Game Revolution, \\"they'll be remembered as much for their loving-yet- irrational fanboys.\\" In 2008, Joystiq stated they would not mind seeing one of the Battletoads in a Super Smash Bros. game, while GamesRadar featured them among the \\"game characters that time forgot\\" yet \\"deserved more.\\" Pocket Gamer included the Battletoads among the top ten forgotten handheld video game characters in 2011, adding that \\"these guys could have been legendary superstars featuring in mediocre CG movies today. Instead, they are consigned to limbo.\\" In 2012, 411mania.com similarly listed them among the video game characters \\"that need comebacks\\". EventHubs readers voted Rash a character they would most like to see as a guest fighter in the new Killer Instinct game in 2013. == See also == * List of anthropomorphic animal superheroes ==References== Category:Animal characters in video games Category:Animal superheroes Category:Anthropomorphic characters in video games Category:Anthropomorphic martial artists Category:Fictional frogs and toads Category:Fictional programmers Category:Fictional shapeshifters Category:Fictional trios Category:Killer Instinct guest characters Category:Male characters in video games Category:Microsoft protagonists Category:Mutant characters in video games Category:Superhero teams Category:Video game characters in comics Category:Video game characters in television Category:Video game characters introduced in 1991 Category:Video game characters with superhuman strength ","title":"Battletoads (characters)"},{"id":"35890458","text":"The following is a list of county roads in Manatee County, Florida.

Internal tensions led to the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830/31, with Venezuela declaring independence in 1811. For the rest of the nineteenth century, independent Venezuela saw a range of caudillos (strongmen) compete for power. Leading political figures include José Antonio Páez (a leading figure particularly 1829–1847), Antonio Guzmán Blanco (1870 - 1887) and Cipriano Castro (1899 - 1908). In a succession of rebellions, the Federal War (1858 - 1863) was particularly bloody, and saw the establishment of the modern system of States of Venezuela (replacing the Provinces of Venezuela largely inherited from the colonial era). The turn of the century saw several notable international crises which contributed to the development of the United States' Monroe Doctrine: the Venezuela Crisis of 1895 under Joaquín Crespo (regarding a dispute with Britain over Guayana Esequiba) and the Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903 (regarding Venezuela's refusal to pay foreign debts) under Cipriano Castro. ==Overview== Contrary to popular belief, Venezuela in the 19th century following independence did not experience one continuous civil war during which one caudillo followed another without rhyme or reason, the victors liquidating the defeated as a matter of course. As in human affairs everywhere, patterns of political ascendancy, downfalls, and resurgences developed.Morón, Guillermo, A History of Venezuela, 1964 The same geographical reasons that had made possible the formation of Venezuela as a distinct national entity separate from New Granada during the colonial period, also made Venezuela a country difficult to govern. Venezuela had various regions: the Andes, the plains that stretched from the borders with New Granada to the Orinoco delta, Guayana, the Maracaibo basin, the Coro region, the Barquisimeto region, and central Venezuela, formed by the Caracas- Valencia axis and its surrounding areas. The llanos themselves comprised different sub-regions: the eastern part which included the Cumaná region (and the island of Margarita by extension), the Apure llanos, and the central and western llanos. Except for the llanos, where there were no geographical barriers between them, the other regions were separated from each other by either outright mountain ranges or rough mountainous terrains. The distinction between the eastern, central and western llanos was due to political precedents and circumstances. The eastern llanos and Guayana, had practically fought their own war of independence within the wider war of independence. They also had outlets to the sea. The central and western llanos, which politically were considered extensions of Caracas (except Barinas), had varying access to the central region. The Apure llanos were a prolongation of the central llanos. The western llanos, with the capital in Barinas, had been a province separate from Caracas, but they were in effect (the same as Apure) part of the same social, military, and political landscape. Independence saw Venezuela possibly the most impoverished country in Spanish America. In 1800 the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt had estimated the population of the province of Venezuela at around one million.Humboldt, Alexander von, Viaje a las Regiones Equinocciales del Nuevo Continente, Caracas, 1941. Humboldt is the ultimate authority of pre-independence Venezuela. A calculation made by Agustin Codazzi, an Italian officer and engineer who chose Venezuela as his homeland, put the population at 810,000Codazzi, Agustin, Resumen de la geografia de Venezuela, originally published in 1841; re-printed in Caracas in 1940 Whether these figures are reliable or not, it is undeniable that after over a decade of incessant warfare, Venezuela's population must have gone down, if not from the wars themselves, from the unstable social conditions they engendered. Venezuela had no means of communication outside of the caminos reales (royal roads) from the colonial period. There existed a stone- paved camino real from Caracas to La Guaira and there were earthen roads that crisscrossed central Venezuela from Caracas to Valencia and from the center to the llanos. In the llanos themselves, there were the trails made by cattle- herders from one town to another. In the rest of Venezuela, roads were no better than mule tracks that followed lines of least resistance. Caracas had started re-building itself when the war for independence ended, but by all measurable social standards the city had deteriorated from its colonial apogee. It had no public buildings of any note. Its cathedral would have been considered a minor church in México. In terms of social organization, Venezuela had inherited the colonial distinctions between the minority ruling whites, the majority un-enfranchised pardos, and the slaves. Government was mostly a local affair. The country was 90% or more rural and the regional caudillos exerted their authority from their own large land holdings through the small towns that acted mostly in name as capitals in all the regions. Despite its relative insignificance as a city, Caracas was the symbol of political power and its control was considered to some extent legitimating. In brief, Venezuela was not a cohesive country, but the political forces that determined its history were not entirely arbitrary or chaotic. In the seventy years from 1829 to 1899, by one official tally, Venezuela had thirty presidential terms, but this leaves out some transitional presidencies which would boost the figure to 41. In reality, a mere 16 presidents served a total of 28 non-transitional terms. One cannot regard Venezuela as stable during this period: at least thirty insurrections occurred, albeit most of them unsuccessful. The usual pattern was that some local, usually white, caudillo would \\"recruit\\" an \\"army\\" of 100 or more pardos and make a pompous \\"revolutionary\\" proclamation. If this caudillo had some measure of charisma, he could put other caudillos on his side and, with the other recruited pardos, march on Caracas. If he succeeded in seizing power, his continued success depended on his getting other caudillos to put down the minor insurrections that cropped up here and there against him. There were other features of note. In Venezuela, as if the caudillos had a tacit understanding among themselves, there were no political executions with but one minor(?) exception. All a significant caudillo had to fear from failure was either jail, usually for a short term, or exile. However, these privileges did not extend to the pardos, who were easy to recruit, easy to punish, and easy to forget once a caudillo was in power. Between 1830 and 1899 the series of caudillos who succeeded each other as president came mostly from the llanos, the Eastern region, and from the state of Falcón. From 1899 until 1958, chieftains from the Andean regions held the presidency.Liss, p 10. Liss, Sheldon Diplomacy and Dependency: Venezuela, the United States, and the Americas. Salisbury, North Carolina, U.S.A., 1978. Roughly, one can divide the history of Venezuela in the 19th century into the following periods: # the ascendancy of José Antonio Páez (1829–1847), during which he had the support of Carlos Soublette; # the Monagas ascendancy (1847–1858) # the Federal War (1858–1863) # the Federalist period (1863–1870) # the Antonio Guzmán Blanco ascendancy, with Joaquin Crespo as its main caudillo supporter (1870–1887) # the civilian presidencies and the Crespo ascendancy (1887–1899) ==Páez ascendant (1829 - 1847)== Following Venezuela's separation from Gran Colombia, the Venezuelan congress approved a new constitution and banned Bolívar from his own homeland.Thus Liss, p 10. Although the 1830 Constitution prescribed democracy, tradition and practical difficulties militated against the actual working of a republican form of government, and in practice an oligarchy governed the nation. Páez ruled either as president or as the man-behind-the-throne from 1830 to 1846; and later, from 1860 to 1863, as dictator.Liss, p10. A distinguished military leader in the independence war and a colleague of Bolívar, Páez had a strong claim to the Presidency, especially as, despite his pardo origins, the white oligarchy in Caracas supported him enthusiastically. During his first year in office Páez created a three-man Office of Foreign Relations within the Ministry of Finance. It had little occasion to deal with war-related diplomacy between Venezuela and other states, because Venezuela had only small military forces and they had the primary function of protecting the presidency from internal threats and of maintaining order. (This has remained the essential role of the Venezuelan military to .) The Foreign Office dealt mostly with difficulties involving foreign citizens doing business in Venezuela: especially breaches of contract, damage to persons and property during civil strife, and acts of oppression such as illegal imprisonment of aliens.Liss, p 10, on the formation and role of the Foreign Office, and p 10 and elsewhere on the mainly internal function of the army. Doctor José María Vargas, like Páez a member of the Conservative Party, became president in February 1835. As a civilian, he had the support of some who wanted an alternative to the independence-war military veterans who had predominated in Venezuelan politics. In July 1835 the Revolution of the Reforms led by José Tadeo Monagas outed Vargas, but he returned to power when Páez defeated the rebels. He resigned permanently in April 1836. Monagas, the leader of the rebellion, had served as a distinguished independence-war general. Although defeated, he suffered few consequences because he had his base in the Eastern llanos, a region where Páez had no effective control. Besides, Monagas had as much right as Páez to count among the \\"liberators\\" of Venezuela and he had the additional credential that, whereas Páez had turned his back on Bolivar's Gran Colombia, he, at least in principle, had manifested his allegiance to it until its disintegration was irremediable. Independence-war general Carlos Soublette, a Conservative, became president in 1837. Páez succeeded him in 1839 and the Venezuelan nation finally acknowledge its debt to the man to whom it owed its very freedom. In 1842, Bolívar's remains were brought from Santa Marta, Colombia, where he died, to Caracas and entombed in the national cathedral. Soublette took the reins from Páez again in 1843, and governed until 1847.Liss, p 12, says he governed until 1848. ==Monagas ascendancy (1847 - 1858)== Carlos Soublette proved an honest but lackluster president, in some ways a foil to Páez, and he could not prevent the \\"election\\" of Monagas to the presidency in 1847. It is the accepted wisdom that all the \\"elections\\" that are mentioned as occurring in the Venezuelan 19th century were a sham or non- existent, but this is not exactly accurate. There were elections, but these were held at the municipal level and of course the pardos had no vote. This tradition of indirect elections through local councils would last in Venezuela until 1945. While President Monagas broke with the Conservative Party. In 1848, his supporters assaulted parliament and he imposed personal rule and sent Páez into exile. His younger brother, José Gregorio Monagas, won election as president for the 1851-1855 term and also governed dictatorially. José Tadeo returned as president in 1855 but resigned in March 1858 in the face of an insurrection in Valencia which was led by Julián Castro and included elite members of both the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party. Both brothers governed as Liberals. José Gregorio abolished slavery in 1854, and José Tadeo abolished capital punishment. The eastern llanos produced many caudillos because its economy was open to international trade and the exports from that region (cattle, hides, coffee) were staples of the Venezuelan economy. ==Federal War (1858 - 1863)== Battle of Maiquetía, during the beginning of the Federal War. 2 September 1859 Three days after José Tadeo Monagas' resignation, Julián Castro seized the Presidency in a coup d'état. Castro became the first military President who had not fought in the War of Independence. Castro was a creature of the Caracas-Valencia oligarchy and not very effectual. During his presidency, there was a proliferation of aspiring caudillos in Caracas itself and he exiled them all. This was what provoked the Great War of the Caudillos, called in Venezuelan historiography the Guerra Federal or the Federalist War, although federalism was not what these men really had in mind. Castro was not competent either as president or as soldier and he handed power to the civilians of the oligarchy, who were soon being overwhelmed by insurrections in the central and western llanos, with Federalist leaders including Ezequiel Zamora. José Antonio Páez was called backed from exile in the US, and ruled as dictator from 1861 to 1863; but he was no longer the caudillo he once was and he had to surrender to the leader of the federalists, Juan Crisóstomo Falcón. One result of the War of the Caudillos was that the official denomination of Venezuela was changed from \\"republic\\" to the \\"United States of Venezuela\\", a national name it had, as well as the motto \\"God and Federation\\", until a dictator in the mid-20th century changed it back to \\"republic\\". ==Federalist period (1863 - 1870)== Falcón had been an excellent caudillo, but he made a feckless president, especially as he was wont to spend a lot of time in his native Coro. He was succeeded by weak presidents from central Venezuela. Jose Ruperto Monagas tried to save the federalist government, but he was no match for the greatest of the guerrilla leaders, Antonio Guzmán Blanco, who had spent much of his public life as Venezuelan ambassador at large. When he came to power, he did not do so in the name of federalism, which he once espoused, but as a liberal. Venezuela was a country of peripheral enclaves, defined by ports through which international commerce was carried on. These enclaves were the source of customs revenues, which, with some foreign loans, were the main fiscal resources of the Venezuelan government. Caracas had its port of La Guaira, to which it had been connected by a railroad. Valencia was linked to Puerto Cabello. Maracaibo constituted an enclave in itself. It was the outlet for coffee, mostly by river and lake Maracaibo from Táchira, in the Venezuelan Andes, and from Colombia. The eastern llanos had an excellent natural harbor near Lecherias, but its potential was not discovered until well into the 20th century with the rise of the oil industry. The telegraph had been introduced since the 1850s, but it went from Caracas to Valencia. ==Guzmán Blanco ascendancy (1870 - 1887)== Guzmán Blanco, the most sophisticated Venezuelan president (in office three times between 1870 and 1887) of the 19th century, was also the most charismatic of the caudillos. He adeptly contracted loans for Venezuela, from which he amassed a small fortune. Guzmán Blanco had ambitious goals for Venezuela. He wanted to make Caracas a mini-Paris and he did build some theaters and a capitol, but these projects were on a very minor scale. He was also good at progressive legislation. He declared education free and obligatory for all Venezuelans, but Venezuela still had no roads, so his decree was wishful thinking. He did build the railroad from Caracas to Valencia and tried in other ways to modernize the country, but the facts were stacked against him in a country of over one million square kilometers with a wild and inhospitable topography and its some 1,200,000 inhabitants living mostly in rural areas. The political stability of Venezuela was principally the doing of his principal lieutenant. ==Civilian presidencies and Crespo ascendancy (1887 - 1899)== El General Joaquín Crespo y los jefes de la Revolución Legalista, by Arturo Michelena. Joaquín Crespo was President 1884–1886 and 1892–1898. Guzmán Blanco decided to retire to Paris in 1887 at the age of 59. He died there in 1899. He had left behind statues of himself and other reminders of his prolonged direct and indirect rule. Also, he left a country in relative peace. His appointed successor, Hermógenes López, was a colorless caudillo, who inaugurated some of the projects Guzmán Blanco had started, among them a submarine cable to Curaçao, which linked Venezuela to the rest of the world, and the Valencia-Puerto Cabello railroad. López was replaced by the civilian Juan Pablo Rojas Paúl with Guzmán Blanco's far-away blessing. Joaquín Crespo, who thought he should have been chosen president, went into exile and started planning his own revolution. Rojas Paúl actively promoted an anti-Guzmán popular reaction in Caracas and other cities. He turned power over to another civilian, Raimundo Andueza Palacios, who forgot the cardinal rule of relying on caudillos for support, a power vacuum which Crespo promptly filled in 1892. Ambitious but unassuming, Crespo ruled until 1898 and handed power to Ignacio Andrade, but Crespo was the military mainstay of the government. In suppressing a serious threat to the government he was killed in action and Andrade was left to fend for himself. Venezuela supported its claim by printing an 1896 postage stamp with a map showing Guyana up to the east bank of the Essequibo River as \\"Guayana Venezolana\\".Russell W. Stern, The Politics of Printing in Stamp Design and Production , \\"NSW Philatelist\\", 15 October 2008 Under Crespo, Venezuela experienced an international crisis in what became known as the Venezuela Crisis of 1895. The crisis occurred over Venezuela's longstanding dispute with the United Kingdom about the territory of Essequibo and Guayana Esequiba, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory. As the dispute became a crisis, the key issue became Britain's refusal to include in the proposed international arbitration the territory east of the \\"Schomburgk Line\\", which a surveyor had drawn half a century earlier as a boundary between Venezuela and the former Dutch territory of British Guiana.Willard L. King (2007), Melville Weston Fuller - Chief Justice of the United States 1888-1910, Macmillan. p249 The crisis ultimately saw Britain accept the United States' intervention in the dispute to force arbitration of the entire disputed territory, and tacitly accept the United States' right to intervene under the Monroe Doctrine. A tribunal convened in Paris in 1898 to decide the matter, and in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to British Guiana.Graff, Henry F., Grover Cleveland (2002). . pp123-25 ==Cipriano Castro (1899 - 1908)== Of all the regions of Venezuela, the Andes and Guayana had not participated actively in the many insurrections that had plagued the other parts of Venezuela. The llanos had been the great battleground of most of the confrontations between caudillos, whose struggles spilled over into Barquisimeto. Coro had been the favorite landing site for most of the rebellions, especially the Great War of the Caudillos. Maracaibo at one time tried to go autonomous and had to be taken by arms. Guayana was so under-populated it hardly counted. But the Andes was another story. It was the richest region of Venezuela through the export of coffee. It had a healthful, high-altitude climate. It probably accounted for perhaps half the total population of Venezuela. Malaria and yellow fever and other tropical scourges had become endemic in the llanos. A rebel from Trujillo, the Andean province closest to central Venezuela, had once tried and failed at rebellion. But in the 1890s the Andeans, especially in Táchira, started flexing their muscles. When Crespo was killed, Venezuela entered a period of uncertainty as Andrade was not himself a caudillo and he was Crespo's placeman. In 1899, the Tachirense Cipriano Castro, a short-tempered and highly ambitious man, formed a real army with Andean recruits and the support of his friend Juan Vicente Gómez. Castro met practically no resistance on his march to Caracas. His forces were larger now under the command of Gómez. As was to be expected, the new government was like lighting not one but many fuses to many enterprising, aspiring caudillos. Castro was himself courageous, but he did not need to take the field: he had Gómez, who in two years of active campaigning with his Andean troops put down not only the ongoing rebellions, but even made sure that there were not to be any more rebellions by placing Andean lieutenants and Andean troops in all the regional capitals of Venezuela. W.A. Rogers, published in the New York Herald, January, 1903. Castro is shown as a thin goose being plucked bare by Britain and Germany, while Uncle Sam looks on. Few would deny two things about Castro: he was a debauchee with an insatiable taste for cognac and he was a daredevil in foreign relations defying Europe as if he had a navy and adequate coastal defenses. Many Venezuelans consider Castro a great patriot but in fact, when he got embroiled with his Venezuela's European creditors, he did not hesitate to invoke the Monroe Doctrine in defense of his country's sovereignty, just as previous presidents had tried to do in relation to the issues which culminated in the Venezuela Crisis of 1895. Castro had nothing to do with this affair, but he inherited from his predecessors a burden of foreign debt which he refused to honor. The resulting crisis of 1902–3 saw an international fleet of European gunboats blockade Venezuela's coasts. With the Guiana border precedent in mind, Castro invoked again the Monroe Doctrine. Germany was aggressively pursuing its blockade in western Venezuela, where there was a large colony of German merchants in Maracaibo, and this preoccupied the Theodore Roosevelt administration, which told the Germans to back off.Herwig, Helger. H, Germany's Vision of Empire in Venezuela, 1871-1914, 1985 But at the same time it told Castro that the Monroe Doctrine did not apply to unpaid debts.Schoult, Lars, A History of U.S. Policy towards Latin America, 1998 The debt question was sent to the Hague Tribunal which faulted Venezuela. Castro was reluctantly forced to start paying up, but the total cancellation of the overdue bills did not occur under his government. Another war, this time with the Netherlands, broke out in late 1908. In 1908, Castro was too sick to be cured in Venezuela and he left for Germany leaving Gómez in charge. Castro had not gone further than the outer Antilles when Gómez took over the government and forbade Castro from returning with the support of the US Navy. This was the beginning of a regime that lasted until 1935 and is interwoven with the early development of the oil industry, the greatest influence ever on the history of Venezuela. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Reuben Zahler.

As well as inventing the DPD method of detecting chlorine in water and working as an official advisor to the American Water Works Association (AWWA), Dr Palin was responsible for what the Manual of British Water Engineering Practice records as one of the key historical developments, when breakpoint chlorination was first used in England in the city of Coventry in 1943. ==Education== Dr Palin's contributions to technical literature have appeared in Canada, Japan, Spain, France, Germany, the U.S. and the U.K. He held a first class degree from the University of London, was awarded a Ph.D. for his chlorination research and was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry. He was an official advisor to the Standard Methods Committee of the AWWA, and an active member of several of its joint task groups and the Research and Water Quality Disinfection committees. == Career  Early career === Dr Palin's early experience in water quality testing and control was gained in the service of what was then the London Midland & Scottish Railway Co. His work involved the supervision of the water supplies to a number of large railway towns in the U. K., and included checking the purity of the water supply to the Royal Train. In 1940, he was appointed first waterworks chemist to the city of Coventry, to supervise the wartime operation of the emergency water supply. The treatment problems in converting contaminated raw water sources into drinkable water stimulated his interest in the application of new and safer methods of water treatment. The challenge to achieve the highest possible quality standards led to the first application in the U.K. of such novel treatments as breakpoint chlorination, already in limited use at that time in the U.S. Although the water supply system in Coventry was extensively damaged by enemy bombing on many occasions, at no time did the public suffer harm from contaminated water. The purity and wholesomeness of the supply was maintained at all times. Breakpoint chlorination is now widely practiced throughout the world. While the practical benefits afforded by breakpoint chlorination in providing better and faster disinfection of water and other quality improvements were, in those early days, already becoming well established, little was known about the chemical reactions involved in the breakpoint phenomenon. On a practical level, there was also a need for more reliable control tests. It was this need for a greater understanding of the process that triggered Dr. Palin's classic work on chlorination chemistry and his development of new test procedures, including the first practical method for the separate determination of free chlorine, monochloramine, dichloramine and nitrogen trichloride, all of which may, under certain conditions, be found in chlorinated water. It was the development of this analytical method, using the indicator diethyl para phenylene diamine (DPD), that provided the key to open the door to the explanation of the breakpoint in chlorination and laid the foundation for the present classification of modern processes. With this new knowledge and means of control, chlorination could be applied to water supplies and to swimming pools to give maximum efficiency in disinfection with minimum production of unwanted side effects such as objectionable tastes and odors in drinking water and compounds in swimming pool water that cause eye irritation. The DPD method is now the international standard method for the measurement of free chlorine and combined chlorine residuals. In addition, it is applicable to the determination of other residuals such as chlorine dioxide, bromine, iodine and ozone. === The Palintest System of Water Testing === In 1945, Palin became the first chief chemist and bacteriologist to the Newcastle and Gateshead Water Co. and established a scientific department with laboratories for research and development. It became evident to Dr. Palin that, outside the laboratory, there was a need for a simple, reliable system of routine water testing suitable for use by works operators, upon whom the safety of the public water supply depends. He developed a system based upon the use of standardized test tablets, applicable to the treatment control of potable water, swimming pools, sewages and effluents, boiler waters and industrial waters of all types. Wilkinson & Simpson, now Palintest Ltd (part of Halma plc), contributed to the development of the tablet tests, and in 1960 were granted an exclusive licence to manufacture and market the Palintest System of water testing. Palin retired from his position with Newcastle and Gateshead Water Co. in 1977 and joined the Palintest Board. That year saw the inauguration by the company of a new River Tyne Abstraction Scheme. Included in the scheme were new central laboratories, which were named the Palin Laboratories in acknowledgement of Palin's contributions. Further recognitions of Palin's work include a gold medal at the Public Works Congress of 1950, and in the Honours list of 1975 he was given an OBE. At the AWWA conference of 1979, he was made an Honorary Member. He was awarded the Houston Medal of the Institution of Water Engineers for work of outstanding merit for his work on fluoridation control methods. ==References== Category:1916 births Category:Alumni of the University of London Category:English chemists Category:Organic chemists Category:2006 deaths ","title":"Arthur Thomas Palin"},{"id":"35890538","text":"The University of Kalemie (UNIKAL) is a public university located in the city of Kalemie, in Tanganyika Province of the southeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The lead compounds were first fused, and the product then ground to fine powder. The powder was then suspended in drying oils (e.g. linseed), to produce e.g. Pattinson's white (PbCl2 2Pb(OH)2) or Turner's yellow (PbCl2 5-7PbO). Turner's yellow is also known as Patent yellow, Cassel yellow, Montpelier yellow, Kassler yellow, mineral yellow, and Verona yellow. In the late 19th century, lead oxychlorides were briefly used in the manufacture of electrodes for lead-acid batteries. Patented by Charles Francis Brush in 1876, the depressions in a ribbed or grooved sheet of lead were filled with pulverized lead oxychloride (later also lead sulfate). In a second step, the grooved sheet was covered with paper and horizontally suspended in a salt or acid solution, to which a zinc plate was then also added. The mixture in the grooved sheet's depressions was then electrolytically reduced to sponge lead, forming a functional lead-acid cell electrode (if subsequently used as a positive electrode, the sponge lead was converted to lead peroxide during the cell's initial \\"formation\\" charge). Brush's technique was superseded by the now standard Faure pasting method in 1880. ==References== Category:Lead compounds ","title":"Lead oxychloride"},{"id":"35890618","text":"El Trienio Adeco was a three-year period in Venezuelan history, from 1945 to 1948, under the government of the popular party Democratic Action (, its adherents adecos). The party gained office via the 1945 Venezuelan coup d'état against President Isaías Medina Angarita, and held the first democratic elections in Venezuelan history, beginning with the 1946 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election. The 1947 Venezuelan general election saw Democratic Action formally elected to office, but it was removed from office shortly after in the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état. ==Background== In exile Rómulo Betancourt had flirted with communism but he came to believe that he wasn’t going to get very far along that path. President Isaías Medina Angarita fostered the further professionalization of the Venezuelan officer corps. Among others, he sent Capt. Marcos Pérez Jiménez to the Peruvian military academy, which was reputed in Latin America as being very efficient, where the young Andean officer had as professor Gen. Manuel Odria, later to become dictator of Perú. Another Peruvian influence on Venezuelan politics was Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, who tried to create an inter-American alliance of leftist anti-imperialist parties, which vaguely fitted Betancourt's own program. Another up-and-coming officer was Carlos Delgado Chalbaud, the son of the anti-Juan Vicente Gómez conspirator Román Delgado Chalbaud. Delgado Chalbaud had spent most of his life in France, where he studied engineering and later attended the St. Cyr military academy. He returned to Venezuela in 1939 and was promptly commissioned in the Venezuelan army by president General Eleazar Lopez Contreras. Because of his background, Delgado was the undisputed leader of a group of conspirational officers, among whom the second most important was Marcos Pérez Jiménez. ==1945 coup d'etat== Members of the Revolutionary Government Junta, from left to right: Mario Ricardo Vargas, Raúl Leoni, Valmore Rodríguez, Rómulo Betancourt, Carlos Delgado Chalbaud, Edmundo Fernández and Gonzalo Barrios. Miraflores Palace, 1945 As the 1945 elections approached, Betancourt, who knew how large his national political base was now, accepted Medina's invitation to participate in them on the tacit understanding that the official candidate, Diogenes Escalante, would win with the support of Acción Democrática (AD), as Betancourt's party had been named. In exchange, the following elections would be totally democratic. Escalante was party to this agreement, but on his return to Venezuela from Washington, where he was ambassador, to participate in his own election, he started mumbling and making incoherent statements. The man was insane being forced to abandon politics and spend the rest of his life in a psychiatric center in Miami, Florida. President Medina then made a mistake, to choose a substitute for Escalante without consulting AD. He proposed to his Minister of Agriculture, Angel Biagini, but this one did not count on the favor of Betancourt, and the route of Coup d'etat was activated again. Betancourt was incensed and so it was that the strongest political party in Venezuela and the military conspirators, none of which had a rank higher than major, made a deal whose consequences were to be long-lasting. In October 1945, the military declared itself in open rebellion in Caracas and Betancourt called on the people to stage a civilian uprising.Betancourt, Romulo, Venezuela, Oil and Politics, 1979 Medina resigned, but it is generally acknowledged that the army, except for the rebels, was on his side and could have put down the rebellion and arrest the insubordinate officers. The army was the making of Gomez and Lopez Contreras and even Medina and was a disciplined institution. However, the long history of violence in Venezuelan politics during the previous century made Medina not want a bloody civil war on his hands.Caballero, Manuel, y otros, El 18 de Octubre de 1945, 1994 ==Adeco government== Rómulo Betancourt voting in the 1946 elections A junta formed, headed by Betancourt, as provisional president, and with Delgado as Minister of Defence. The 1946 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election showed that AD under Betancourt had indeed become the party of the vast majority of Venezuelans. Two other parties were founded: COPEI (Independent Electoral Committee), by the pro-clerical Rafael Caldera, whose party later was later re-baptized Social Christian COPEI; and URD (Democratic Republican Union), which was joined by Jóvito Villalba, considered one of the greatest orators in Venezuelan history, and made over practically into his personal party. Since the death of Gomez, the following governments had been gradually increasing oil taxes. In the junta, development minister Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso decreed a 50-50 sharing agreement with the oil companies. The junta also took other daring measures. Catholic schools, which were the best in the country, were forced to close temporarily while a new national curriculum was elaborated. Agrarian reform was approved. But most noticeable was that bureaucracy, which previously had been kept at the barest possible minimum, made a phenomenal forward leap, and not just because of all the reforming that had to be done but also because AD had to reward its more prominent backers. The white/pardo divide was in theory demolished although in practice not many pardos could fulfill even the lowest requirements for civil service, into which nevertheless many entered. A national educational campaign was inaugurated, but fundamentally, as the majority of Venezuelans were still illiterate, all this amounted to was that the few who could read would be teaching the many that could not. There was a national election for the presidency in 1947, which the adeco candidate, the talented novelist Romulo Gallegos, won, again by a huge margin. But at the time there was much discontent in the middle class, which was Caldera's base of support—he got 262,000 votes—not to speak of the upper crust; and of course the officers who had ushered AD into power were on the lookout for the main chance. ==1948 coup d'etat== There was no particular incident that set off the bloodless 1948 coup, which was led by Delgado Chalbaud. There was no popular opposition. This might have meant that the odds were too great or that the pardo masses had not noticed any particular improvement in their lives despite the incessant government propaganda. All prominent adecos were expelled. The other parties were allowed but muzzled. ==References== Category:History of Venezuela Category:1945 in Venezuela Category:1946 in Venezuela Category:1947 in Venezuela Category:1948 in Venezuela ","title":"El Trienio Adeco"},{"id":"35890646","text":"Pinball arcade may refer to: * Amusement arcade, a place with pinball machines * The Pinball Arcade, a pinball video game developed by FarSight Studios * Microsoft Pinball Arcade, a pinball video game from Microsoft * Pinball Arcade (video game), a 1994 game by Spidersoft ==See also== * Arcade Pinball ","title":"Pinball arcade"},{"id":"35890648","text":"Félix Verdejo Sánchez (born May 19, 1993) is a Puerto Rican professional boxer who competes as a lightweight. As an amateur he represented Puerto Rico at the 2012 Olympics. ==Amateur career== Verdejo was the winner at lightweight at the 2012 American Boxing Olympic Qualification Tournament. Qualification was assured when Verdejo defeated a Mexican rival in the quarter-finals since the top-4 finishers qualified for the 2012 Olympics in his weight class. At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Verdejo defeated Panamanian José Huertas in the first round with a score of 11–5. Then he defeated Tunisian Ahmed Mejri with a 16–7 score before losing to Vasyl Lomachenko of Ukraine in the quarterfinals 14–9. Verdejo was also a Panamerican Youth Champion. ==Professional career== Verdejo vs. Petchsamuthr Duanaaymukdahan at CotaiArena in Macau in November 2013 === Early career === In October 2012, a 19 year old Verdejo became a professional by joining Top Rank, signing for an undisclosed amount that reportedly included a bonification $600,000 dollars. Verdejo won the \\"New Hispanic Promise\\" category of the 2013 Premios Juventud on July 18 of that year. After closing his 2013 campaign, Verdejo was voted \\"Prospect of the Year\\" by BoxingScene and Top Rank. He also finished second in Yahoo!'s list, which noted that any other year he would have been a \\"slam dunk winner\\". In his first fight of 2014, Verdejo faced undefeated Lauro Alcantar, winning by knockout in only 21 seconds. Verdejo continued his success throughout 2014, going 7–0 with 6 KO, making his career record 16–0 (KO 12). ESPN.com would go on to name Verdejo 'Prospect of the Year' for 2014.  WBO Latino champion Verdejo would get his first chance to claim his first title, it was announced in January 2015. Top Rank announced Mexican Marco Antonio López (24–5, 15 KOs) as his opponent in a scheduled 8 round bout for February 28, however this was later changed to a 10-round bout and took place on April 25, due to verdejo injuring his hand. The fight was contested for the vacant WBO Latino lightweight title, which was only at stake for Verdejo as Lopez weight 4 pounds over the lightweight limit. The fight took place in Puerto Rico as Verdejo claimed the vacat title via a fifth-round technical knockout. At the time of stoppage, all three judges had it 40–36 in favour of Verdejo. Verdejo made his first defence against undefeated American Ivan Najera (16–0, 8 KOs) on June 13 at the Madison Square Garden Theater in New York City. Verdejo, making his HBO debut, defeated Najera in a wide unanimous decision to retain the title. Verdejo scored two knockdowns and outpointed Najera with two judges scoring the bout 100–88 and one judge had it 99–89. Verdejo connected with 40% of his punches thrown compared to 30% from Najera. On December 11, Verdejo made a second successive defence of his WBO Latino title in Puerto Rico against Brazilian Josenilson Dos Santos (27–3, 17 KOs). In round two, Verdejo hit a big right hand that dropped dos Santos, although dos Santos beat the count, referee Roberto Ramirez Jr. stopped the fight after a count was given. Verdejo started off 2016 with a defence against undefeated Brazilian William Silva (23–0, 14 KOs) on the undercard of Crawford-Lundy on February 27, 2016, at the Madison Square Garden Theater. The fight was televised on HBO. Verdejo landed 106 of 421 total punches as he cruised to a one sided 10 round unanimous decision win against Silva who connected 45 of 325 total punches. Two judges had it 100–90 for Verdejo and the third judge had it 99–91. Verdejo would next fight two months later, returning to Puerto Rico against 29 year old Mexican Jose Luis Rodriguez (18–8, 11 KOs), who was on a four fight win streak, on April 16 in a 10-round bout at the Coliseo Roberto Clemente. Verdejo was originally supposed to fight Daniel Evangelista (18–6–2, 14 KOs), who withdrew from the fight due to tendonitis. Verdejo won a one sided 10 round unanimous decision win over Rodriguez. He won the fight by the judges scoring it 99–91, 99–91 and 98–92. Verdejo used his power and speed advantage to punish Rodriguez with big shots to the head and body throughout the ten rounds. With this win, Verdejo was guaranteed a return to HBO at the Madison Square Garden Theater on June 11 against lightweight contender Jose Felix Jr. (33–1–1, 25 KOs). Following this win, WBA ranked Verdejo at #2 lightweight and WBO ranked him #3. Verdejo fought on the undercard of the title fight between WBO super featherweight champion Martinez vs. Lomachenko at Madison Square Garden Theater in New York on June 11, 2016. He defended his Latino title against 2nd tier Mexican boxer Juan Jose Martinez (25–2, 17 KOs), who had won six fights in a row since a seventh-round technical decision loss to Rey Bautista in September 2014. Verdejo was supposed to fight Felix Jr. however a deal could not be made, according to Top Rank vice president Carl Moretti, Felix asked for about 'four times the money available' for Verdejo's opponent. Verdejo, who had been criticized for his previous two decision wins, stopped Martinez in five rounds to retain his title. Verdejo was the aggressor, out- landing Martinez 90 to 36 and connected on 51 percent of his power shots. In Round 5, Martinez had a cut above his right eye and with 20 seconds remaining, Verdejo pinned Martinez against the ropes, before referee Michael Ortega jumped in at 2:40 and stopped the fight. Verdejo told his translator after the bout that he 'wants to fight the best'. Bob Arum spoke of the possibility of a world title fight between Verdejo and WBO champion Terry Flanagan for early November, however this would no longer be the case due to Verdejo suffering injuries in a motorcycle accident. On December 6, 2016, Verdejo announced that he was close to returning to the ring, slated to be for February 3, 2017, in his native Puerto Rico. Weeks later Top Rank confirmed that he would indeed fight on that date against former super featherweight title challenger Oliver Flores (27–2–2, 17 KOs) at the Coliseo Roberto Clemente in San Juan. Flores is coming off a stoppage loss in December 2015 to then WBA junior lightweight champion Takashi Uchiyama. The fight will aired live on UniMas. Verdejo won the fight via a 10-round unanimous decision. The three judges scored the fight 99–91, 98–92, 96–94 all in favor or Verdejo. With the win Verdejo landed a shot at the WBO lightweight title.  World title mix  On June 12, 2017, the WBO president Francisco Valcarcel received word that promoters Bob Arum and Frank Warren were working closely together to come to an agreement for a fight to take place between Verdejo and undefeated WBO lightweight champion Terry Flanagan. Some sources claimed the fight would take place on September 9 in Manchester. There was a hold up in the negotiations due to Verdejo being offered $175,000, however his representatives were looking for him to earn in the region of $450,000 having to travel to Flanagan's home country to challenge for the title. A deal was finally reached for the fight to take place on September 16, 2017, at the Copper Box Arena in London. WBO middleweight champion Billy Joe Saunders was confirmed to take part on the same card. The fight would also mark the fight time Flanagan would fight in London. On July 17, Warren emailed Top Rank to make them aware that Flanagan had suffered a leg injury, thus postponing the fight. The WBO requested that medical evidence had to be sent to them. Flanagan's team confirmed the evidence would be sent the next day. On August 5, 2017, Top Rank revealed that Verdejo would stay busy and fight on the September 22 undercard of Gilberto Ramírez vs. Jesse Hart in Tucson, Arizona. On August 14, Top Rank announced that Verdejo would fight Mexican boxer Antonio Lozada Jr. (37-2, 31 KOs) at the Convention Center in a 10 round bout. It would have marked the first time Lozada Jr. would ever fight professionally outside of Mexico, however Verdejo picked up an injury in training, forcing him to pull out of the fight. In December 2017, WBO president Francisco Valcarcel stated that Verdejo would need to work his way back into the mandatory position. With Flanagan moving to light welterweight and vacating his WBO lightweight title, the WBO ordered their number #1 Ray Beltrán to fight #3 Paulus Moses for the vacant title. === Career from 2018 === On December 22, 2017, it was announced that Verdejo would return to the ring after 13 months inactivity at the Madison Square Garden Theater on March 17, 2018. A week later, Antonio Lozada Jr. was lined up to fight Verdejo. Lozada was scheduled to fight Verdejo in February 2017. In January 2018, Lozada signed the deal to make the fight official. Verdejo suffered his first loss as a professional, being stopped in round 10. Despite the ring rust, having not fought in over a year, going into the final round Verdejo was ahead 87-84 and 86-85 on two scorecards with Lozada ahead 86-85 on the remaining scorecard. In round 10, Lozada knocked Verdejo down once. After Verdejo beat the count and got to his feet, Lozada began to unload more shots which led to referee Eddie Claudio stopping the fight at 2:37 of the round. Following his first professional career defeat, Verdejo took eight months out and returned to the ring in Puerto Rico on November 10, 2018, against Mexican journeyman Yardley Armenta Cruz. The fight took place at the Mario Quijote Morales Coliseum in Guaynabo. Verdejo returned to winning ways after stopping Cruz in round 2. It was a left hook which sent him down and he was unable to recover. On April 20, 2019, Verdejo fought his second fight after his first loss, on the Crawford vs Khan undercard at the Madison Square Garden, against Bryan Vasquez, ranked #7 by the WBA at lightweight. Verdejo won by a 10-round unanimous decision, with the scorecards reading 97-93, 97-93, 98-92. It was a good win, but fans and media alike thought the once world-class prospect left a lot to be desired. After that fight, some critics pointed out that Verdejo could use a new trainer in the future. In October 2019, he was announced to have met with numerous trainers in the United States, who were interested in working with him. The following month, he announced that he will be working with renowned boxing trainer Ismael Salas, known for training Cuban greats like Guillermo Rigondeaux, Luis Ortiz and Erislandy Lara, in a bid to regain control and restart his career. In his first fight with a new trainer, Felix battled Manuel Rey Rojas to a unanimous ten-round decision. The first few rounds proved to be tougher for the Puerto Rican, but as the fight went on go got up to speed and managed to secure a clear win. Despite securing a clear win, critics were not impressed by the win, mostly because Verdejo felt like a blue-chip prospect and a star-in-making after the 2012 Olympics, but still hasn't delivered on the same level in the professional game. ==Professional boxing record== {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\\" - ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes - 28 Win 27–1 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Will Madera TKO 1 (10), Jul 16, 2020 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  - 27 Win 26–1 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Manuel Rey Rojas UD 10 Jan 18, 2020 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  - 26 Win 25–1 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Bryan Vásquez UD 10 Apr 20, 2019 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  - 25 Win 24–1 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Yardley Armenta Cruz KO 2 (10), Nov 10, 2018 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  - 24 Loss 23–1 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Antonio Lozada Jr. TKO 10 (10), Mar 17, 2018 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  - 23 Win 23–0 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Oliver Flores UD 10 Feb 3, 2017 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 22 Win 22–0 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Juan José Martínez TKO 5 (10), Jun 11, 2016 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 21 Win 21–0 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" José Luis Rodríguez UD 10 Apr 16, 2016 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 20 Win 20–0 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" William Silva UD 10 Feb 27, 2016 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 19 Win 19–0 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Josenilson Dos Santos KO 2 (10), Dec 11, 2015 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" - 18 Win 18–0 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Iván Najera UD 10 Jun 13, 2015 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\" - 17 Win 17–0 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Marco Antonio López TKO 5 (10), Apr 25, 2015 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" style=\\"text- align:left;\\" - 16 Win 16–0 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Karim El Ouazghari TKO 4 (8), Dec 13, 2014 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  - 15 Win 15–0 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Sergio Villanueva KO 3 (8), Oct 4, 2014 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  - 14 Win 14–0 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Oscar Bravo UD 8 Aug 16, 2014 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  - 13 Win 13–0 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Engelberto Valenzuela KO 1 (6), Jun 7, 2014 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  - 12 Win 12–0 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Iván Zavala KO 1 (6), Apr 19, 2014 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  - 11 Win 11–0 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Juan Santiago TKO 3 (6), Mar 22, 2014 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  - 10 Win 10–0 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Lauro Alcantar KO 1 (6), Jan 25, 2014 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  - 9 Win 9–0 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Petchsamuthr Duanaaymukdahan UD 6 Nov 24, 2013 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  - 8 Win 8–0 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Gary Eyer TKO 2 (6), Oct 6, 2013 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  - 7 Win 7–0 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Guillermo Delgadillo UD 6 Aug 10, 2013 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  - 6 Win 6–0 style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Corben Page TKO 4 (6), May 18, 2013 style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  - 5 Win 5–0 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Steve Gutierrez TKO 1 (4), Apr 13, 2013 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"   - 4 Win 4–0 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Martin Quezada TKO 2 (4), Mar 23, 2013 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  - 3 Win 3–0 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" José Santiago  3 (4), Feb 2, 2013 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  - 2 Win 2–0 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Tomi Archambault  1 (4), Jan 19, 2013 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  - 1 Win 1–0 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Leonardo Chavez  4 Dec 6, 2012 style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  } ==Personal life== Verdejo was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico and has two brothers and two sisters.

The house was originally built by the Robinson family sometime between 1785 and 1790. It was architecturally significant for its eighteenth-century construction methods and decorative elements. The surrounding location is also significant as the site of the last engagement between Confederate and Union forces in the Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse on May 19, 1864. Bloomsbury Farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places in May 2000. The house was demolished in December 2014 by Leonard Atkins, a nearby resident who purchased the property in November 2014 ostensibly to restore it. Atkins cited the building's supposedly poor condition and public safety as the reasons for the abrupt demolition, and he planned to replace the historic house with a new one commensurate in style and value with the modern houses in the surrounding development in which he lives. The farm was removed from the National Register in 2017.. ==Design and construction== The house at Bloomsbury Farm began as a late 18th century, single-pile (only one room between the front façade and the rear walls), two- story house. In the early 1800s, the layout of the house was changed when a central hallway was created. Bloomsbury is of braced frame construction. The framing used for the house was hewn and pit-sawn beams and rafters. Wrought nails, hand-hammered from iron, were used as fasteners in the original building. The interior of the walls were filled with brick nogging. The house has two exterior-end chimneys of brick laid in Flemish-bond pattern. The foundation is fieldstone and uses dragon beams to support the east end of the first floor summer beam. ==History== Benjamin Robinson inherited the land on which Bloomsbury Farm is located and built the house sometime between the time he obtained the land and his death in 1790. The farm remained with his widow and then their descendants until 1854, when it was sold to Clement Harris. During the time that Harris owned the farm, it produced of tobacco along with wheat, Indian corn, and oats. The farm remained in the possession of the Harris family until 1883 when it was sold by Thomas Harris to Charles and Charlotte Phillips. Harris repurchased the land again in 1888. In 1913 the property was sold to a holding company and, in 1917, the farm was acquired by Robert Purvis. James McGee bought the land in 1927 and Bloomsbury became a dairy farm. McGee and his family sold milk as the Bloomsbury Sanitary Dairy, selling raw Grade A milk in Fredericksburg, Virginia, until 1937 when they switched to selling bulk cans of milk. The family continued in the dairy business until 1966 when the Jersey cattle were sold. ==Battle of Harris Farm== On May 19, 1864, Bloomsbury Farm was the site of the Harris Farm Engagement (also called the Battle of Harris Farm), during which General Ewell's Confederate soldiers attacked Brig. Gen. Tyler's Union artillery division near the farm. This engagement, the last major action of the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, ended when General Ewell's forces withdrew in the evening. During the fighting, the house was used as a field hospital. In the course of the battle, over 2000 soldiers were killed or wounded. In 1901, a monument dedicated to the memory of the fallen soldiers of the 1st Massachusetts Heavy Artillery was erected on the site.

In 2001, the choir was inducted into the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame in recognition of its promoting and developing music endemic to the Hawaiian culture. Several members of the choir have gone on to achieve commercial and cultural success in the genre of Hawaiian music. ==History== The choir was begun in 1902 by local Hilo music teacher Harry K. Naope Sr. For the indigenous population, belonging to a church choir was a natural extension of the musical culture and training that was part of the Hawaiian home life. In the Hawaiian language, the term mele denotes both ancient chants and also songs. With limited resources and no hymn books to rely on, Naope improvised by copying the individual meles, which he translated from English into the Hawaiian language, onto a single piece of paper tacked up on the walls. Choir members committed the meles to memory. Haili differed from the old missionary choirs in that Naope incorporated secular meles into the choir's repertoire. The choir became known for its a cappella style, developed of necessity in the early days of sporadic instrumental accompaniment. ==Cultural influence== The choir was inducted into the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame in 2001. Credited with being a nurturing and influential environment for Hawaiian culture and music, the choir has produced many accomplished artists, some of whom are also inductees of the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame. Thomas Kihei Desha Brown (1925–1978) was an established band leader and falsetto singer who received his early training in the choir. Composer Albert Po'ai Nahale-a Sr (1910–1970) had been one of the choir's ministers of music. Recording artist Anuhea Audrey Brown (born 1922) was the choir's piano accompanist for two decades, beginning in the 1940s. Falsetto vocalist George Kainapau (1905–1992), who made his first recording in 1929 with Sol Hoʻopiʻi and Andy Iona, also received his early training in the choir. Coloratura soprano Helen Desha Beamer (1882–1952) had served as the church organist. Beamer herself was the matriarch of a family that produced celebrated performers in Hawaiian music.

Such tensors arise naturally in the study of Riemannian manifolds with harmonic curvature or harmonic Weyl tensor. In fact, existence of Codazzi tensors impose strict conditions on the curvature tensor of the manifold. Also, the second fundamental form of an immersed hypersurface in a space form (relative to a local choice of normal field) is a Codazzi tensor. ==Definition== Let (M,g) be a n-dimensional Riemannian manifold for n \\\\geq 3, let T be a symmetric 2-tensor field, and let abla be the Levi-Civita connection. We say that the tensor T is a Codazzi tensor if : ( abla_X T)(Y,Z) = ( abla_Y T)(X,Z) for all X,Y,Z\\\\in T_pM. ==Examples== * Any parallel (0,2)-tensor field is, trivially, Codazzi. * Let (N,\\\\overline{g}) be a space form, let M be a smooth manifold with 1+\\\\dim M=\\\\dim N, and let F:M\\\\to N be an immersion. If there is a global choice of unit normal vector field, then relative to this choice, the second fundamental form is a Codazzi tensor on M. This is an immediate consequence of the Gauss-Codazzi equations. * Let (M,g) be a space form with constant curvature \\\\kappa. Given any function f on M, the tensor \\\\operatorname{Hess}^gf+\\\\kappa fg is Codazzi. This is a consequence of the commutation formula for covariant differentiation. * Let (M,g) be a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and let K be the Gaussian curvature. Then 2\\\\operatorname{Hess}^gK+K^2g is a Codazzi tensor. This is a consequence of the commutation formula for covariant differentiation. * Let Rm denote the Riemann curvature tensor. Then div(Rm)=0 (\\"g has harmonic curvature tensor\\") if and only if the Ricci tensor is a Codazzi tensor. This is an immediate consequence of the contracted Bianchi identity. * Let W denote the Weyl curvature tensor. Then \\\\operatorname{div}W=0 (\\"g has harmonic Weyl tensor\\") if and only if the \\"Schouten tensor\\" ::\\\\operatorname{Ric}-\\\\frac{1}{2n-2}Rg : is a Codazzi tensor. This is an immediate consequence of the definition of the Weyl tensor and the contracted Bianchi identity. ==Rigidity of Codazzi tensors== Matsushima and Tanno showed that, on a Kähler manifold, any Codazzi tensor which is hermitian is parallel. Berger showed that, on a compact manifold of nonnegative sectional curvature, any Codazzi tensor h with trgh constant must be parallel. Furthermore, on a compact manifold of nonnegative sectional curvature, if the sectional curvature is strictly positive at least one point, then every symmetric parallel 2-tensor is a constant multiple of the metric. ==See also== *Weyl–Schouten theorem ==References== * Arthur Besse, Einstein Manifolds, Springer (1987).

After the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état brought an end a three-year experiment in democracy (\\"El Trienio Adeco\\"), a triumvirate of military personnel controlled the government until 1952, when it held presidential elections. These were free enough to produce results unacceptable to the government, leading them to be falsified, and to one of the three leaders, Marcos Pérez Jiménez, assuming the Presidency. His government was brought to an end by the 1958 Venezuelan coup d'état which saw the advent of democracy, with a transition government under Admiral Wolfgang Larrazábal in place until the December 1958 elections. Prior to the elections, three of the main political parties (with the notable exclusion of the Communist Party of Venezuela) signed up to the Punto Fijo Pact power-sharing agreement. ==Background== El Trienio Adeco was a three-year period in Venezuelan history, from 1945 to 1948, under the government of the marxist social democracy party Democratic Action (Accion Democratica (AD), its adherents adecos). The party gained office via the 1945 Venezuelan coup d'état against President Isaías Medina Angarita, named \\"The October Revolution\\" on October 18, 1945. and held the first general elections in Venezuelan history. The 1947 Venezuelan general election saw Democratic Action formally elected to office, but it was removed from office shortly after in the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état. There was no particular incident that set off the bloodless 1948 coup, which was led by colonel Carlos Delgado Chalbaud. There was no popular opposition. This might have meant that the odds were too great or that the pardo masses had not noticed any particular improvement in their lives despite the incessant government propaganda. All prominent adecos were expelled. The other parties were allowed but muzzled. ==Delgado Chalbaud (1948–1952)== Venezuelan historians often say that Delgado Chalbaud was planning to restore Venezuelan democracy. If that was his intention, he did not get the chance to accomplish it. One day in November 1950, as he was being driven unescorted through a wooded part of Caracas towards the presidential palace, he was cut off by cars and kidnapped. His captors took him to an isolated house in southern Caracas. All versions of this incident are more or less agreed that someone's gun went off wounding the leader of the kidnappers, that Delgado Chalbaud was then hustled out of the car and he confronted his abductors, and that finally they shot him to death. The main kidnapper, his nephew Simon Urbina, who was bleeding badly, was soon captured and later, in the then official version, he was killed trying to flee. No one accepts this version, which is why it is widely believed that it was his political partner, Pérez Jiménez, who had Delgado Chalbaud assassinated, nevertheless some believe this is unlikely since the wife of Pérez Jiménez, Doña Flor María Chalbaud Cardona de Pérez Jiménez, was Delgado Chalbaud's cousin. ==Pérez Jiménez dictatorship (1952–1958)== Delgado Chalbaud had formed a triumvirate with Pérez Jiménez and Luis Felipe Llovera Páez. With his death, the remaining triumvirs chose a civilian president, Luis Germán Suárez Flamerich, who was dismissed by the military in 1952, and the ambitious Pérez Jiménez became dictator with the consent of Llovera Páez. The former majors, who had risen to colonels in the democracy, were now generals. Pérez Jiménez himself was physically not very impressive. He was short, balding, and tubby, and read speeches monotonously, although surely on the personal level he must have had some magnetism. He was a megalomaniac of much character that when a Time magazine interviewer asked him what Rome's greatest legacy was, he said, : \\"Its ruins\\", apparently wanting to give the impression that while the ruins of Rome were all that remained of its greatness, his own greatness will surpass them with his visionary building projects. In some ways, this is understandable. Pérez Jiménez, unlike most Venezuelans, received a thorough education from the military academies of Venezuela and Peru which he attended and graduated from with the highest honors. By the time he came to power, Pérez Jiménez had developed a flair for fascist opulence, boasting about his projects aimed at making Venezuela the major power of South America. The greatest of Venezuelan writers at the time (and for a long time after that) was Arturo Uslar Pietri and he became famous on television with analytical biographies of great historical figures. Uslar Pietri had a felicitous phrase: \\"Sow the oil\\" (\\"Sembrar el petroleo\\" in Spanish), which became a national slogan meaning that the state's oil income should be productively invested. But in Venezuela \\"sowing the oil\\" implied \\"sowers\\" and the country did not have too many of these. In fact, it was the undeclared understanding that \\"sowing the oil\\" really meant \\"give Venezuelans employment by creating government jobs\\". The other reason for Pérez Jiménez's \\"ruins revelation\\" was that what he intended to do as president, apart from becoming rich, which he did, like general Juan Vicente Gomez, with his own military and civilian cronies, was to build and build and build, and here too he was undeniably successful. It is only fair to point out here that while Gomez did become immensely rich, he never had a foreign bank account and even though Pérez Jiménez was not as rich as Gomez, all his money was sent to offshore accounts. Pérez Jiménez also had an efficient secret police, but the stories about tortures and killings were, like those about Gomez, mainly inventions by the frustrated adecos, although whoever in Venezuela tried to be active clandestinely was sure to be either imprisoned or shot if he resisted. Like Gomez, Pérez Jiménez had a theoretician, Laureano Vallenilla Lanz, who happened to be the son of Gomez's own historian and had his father's persuasions. Like his father, Laureano was also a racist which became a factor when he authored the national immigration policy. By the time Pérez Jiménez had all the power in his hands, which despite his uninspiring qualities he did manage to do, Venezuela had around five million inhabitants. Depending on which measures you apply, the country can be said to have been under-populated. If you consider, for instance, that population density is not necessarily good, then it could be argued that Venezuela was not under-populated but under-educated. Vallenilla Lanz and Pérez Jiménez's idea was to open the doors of the country to as many Europeans as wanted to come, with which they, and many non-pardo Venezuelans, believed that two flies would be killed with one swat: the country's population would grow, but not with more uneducated pardos but with Europeans who brought with them, however lowly they might have been in their own countries, a higher than average education compared to most Venezuelans. The policy backfired as the immigrants were from the exact countries that had given rise to the existence of pardos. Up to a point, this kind of social engineering might have been defensible, but the immigrants, who came from Spain, Portugal, and Italy on the rationale that they would adapt better to Venezuela and Venezuelans would adapt better to them (than, say, to Swedes), did not emigrate from their countries to give Venezuelans lessons in civics. They came for a better income and the majority of the roughly two million who did come returned home as soon as they had made enough to live better in their own lands. This emigration peaked during the 1980s, when Venezuela's economy took a tumble. It is possible that the proportion of the white population in Venezuela might have increased slightly. Many of the emigrants did make a lot of money and chose Venezuela as their country, but as to industrializing or increasing agricultural production, their effect was not and is not noticeable; and this for the simple reason that the Venezuelan government considered that diversified industrial development was its responsibility and private citizens of any nationality—in this sense, it can be said that Venezuela is perhaps the most un-discriminatory country in the world—were given ample rights in the areas of commerce, of services, and of other ancillary activities. Despite this insidious racism, it was under Pérez Jiménez that the mythification of the Amerindian caciques, who supposedly had resisted the conquistadors everywhere in Venezuela, was given a big boost, especially when an exchange house founded by an Italian immigrant (Italcambio) brought out a series of souvenir gold coins in which each cacique was depicted with facial traits that were invented out of whole cloth by Pérez Jiménez's laureate painter, Pedro Francisco Vallenilla. Despite his rigorous Catholic upbringing, Pérez Jiménez also encouraged the underlying animism of Venezuelans when he erected in the middle of Caracas’ first speedway a statue of Maria Lionza, a sort of Amerindian goddess who sits atop a tapir and is much worshipped in a jungle sanctuary in Yaracuy in central Venezuela. Pérez Jiménez, confident that he had done good work as dictator, scheduled elections for 1952. His official party ran against COPEI and URD, which had only managed puny showings against AD in the presidential election of 1947. When the time came to vote, Venezuela's pardos wanted their adecos back and the exiled leadership of the party let it be known that it wanted URD to win. As the results started coming in showing that AD was still the political top dog in Venezuela, Pérez Jiménez shut down the polls, and the country, and after a few days, during which he probably was making sure that he counted with the loyalty of his generals, he published results that were so lopsidedly in his favor as to seem ludicrous. Pérez Jiménez thus inaugurated himself for another five years as president, and just as he had intended from the beginning. He went on spending on infrastructure and way beyond this to gigantic industrial, agricultural, and power-generating projects. In foreign affairs, Venezuela was a faithful ally of the American government, although servile would probably be more to the point. When the government of the socialist Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala was implementing real social reforms in a country that badly needed them, Venezuela was host to a conference of the OAS (Organization of American States) in which Guatemala was ostracized. Shortly afterwards the CIA sponsored a coup in which Arbenz was overthrown. Pérez Jiménez also changed entirely the face of Caracas with a building program such as the city had not seen since Guzman Blanco, and compared to what Pérez Jiménez built, Guzman's buildings, one of which Pérez Jiménez had cut at the nose, were dwarfs. The author of this \\"face lifting\\" was Luis Malausena, whose taste was in all to Pérez Jiménez's sense of grandeur and went from the ultra-modern to a non- descript \\"neo-classicism\\". The Caracas that one sees today is, then, the unimaginative creation of a character whom no one remembers, and no one probably will as, after he made millions upon millions, he fled the country with Pérez Jiménez, never to be seen again. Caraqueños, incidentally, have never complained about the legacy of Malausena. The next presidential election fell due by the end of 1957. Pérez Jiménez thought he had learned from the 1952 political debacle and instead of an election he decreed a plebiscite on his government. He probably knew he wasn't going to win this one either, so the results were rigged. The people who queued to vote were civil servants and indirect employees of the government and its subordinate companies and institutions, who were instructed to show some proof that they had voted for the regime, usually by presenting the \\"no\\" card, although this was a silly ploy. All the government needed was a turnout, and that is what it got. Economically, Venezuela apparently was not doing so badly, but the signs of prosperity were mostly in the cities, and the countryside, where half of Venezuelans still lived, had social indexes way below what would have been expected from such a fiscally rich country. ==1958 coup d'étatBackground=== On 11 June 1957 Fabricio Ojeda had invited two other Democratic Republican Union (URD) members and a Communist, Guillermo Garcia Ponce, to his home, and they agreed that the time was ripe to form a multi- partisan organisation aiming to overthrow Jiménez. The Patriotic Junta was soon joined by Democratic Action and COPEI, and used the only clandestine press left in Venezuela, that of the Communist Party of Venezuela, to publish a manifesto.Kolb, Glen L. (1974), Democracy and Dictatorship in Venezuela, 1945 - 1958, Connecticut College. p. 165, The Junta ultimately played a leading role in coordinating the coup d'état that took place on 23 January 1958,Kolb (1974:174-8) including organising a general strike on 21 January.Alexander, Robert J. (1982), Romulo Betancourt and the Transformation of Venezuela, Transaction Books, p. 388, ===31 December 1957=== Pérez Jiménez's illegitimacy was so patent that some officers conspired to overthrow him. There was also some cautious civilian clandestine agitation. On the last day of 1957, a military uprising coordinated by officers of air and tank forces struck, but the coordination was not that good. The air force rebels flew over Caracas and dropped randomly some bombs while a commander started out from Maracay with a column of tanks. Somehow the signals got crossed, the tanks turned back, and the pilots fled the country. These officers probably thought that Pérez Jiménez would turn tail in the face of this demonstration, but the bulk of the armed forces remained loyal. ===January 1958=== La Vaca Sagrada, in which Marcos Pérez Jiménez fled to the Dominican Republic. However, this show of defiance did set off a sequence of events which eventually made Pérez Jiménez fear for his political survival. The underground civilian opponents started goading the people in Caracas, where they needed little goading and were out in the streets whenever and wherever they could. The repressive secret police rounded up all civilian suspects, but this was like trying to do the little Dutch boy trick. The popular resistance to the government was not just a pardo thing and reached to all levels of society. The navy had taken a non-committal attitude in a situation where its guns were not of any service. It was not in on any conspiracy. There were signs of restiveness in the land forces with some officers working to rules, so to speak, but there was not at any time a military insurrection. But the crowds were getting bigger and bigger. Finally, with various suitcases stuffed with dollars, Pérez Jiménez took off in his private DC-3 and sought refuge in the Dominican Republic, where his resilient colleague, Rafael Leónidas Trujillo, had been ruling since 1930. ===Transition=== The flight of the dictator ushered in an amazing incident in the history of Venezuela. Pérez Jiménez had been unsure of whom to trust. He was arbitrary and authoritarian but there is no evidence that he was particularly courageous. Like Guzman Blanco, he possibly considered that hanging on to power was not worth the effort, especially considering that his fortune would allow him to live royally outside of Venezuela. When he fled, the country was for all practical purposes leaderless. The Caracas masses had no leader, because no one in the streets had the stature to be one, and any potential leader was in jail. For various days before his hasty departure, Pérez Jiménez had not been giving any inspiration or even orders to the army generals loyal to him, which were still a majority. There were junior officers here and there acting on their own. A military committee was functioning in the military academy. When these officers received word that Pérez Jiménez had left, they felt - reasonably enough - that it was up to them to exercise authority. Thus it was that Wolfgang Larrazábal, an admiral who owed to Pérez Jiménez his rise in the services and who had never manifested any disaffection to him, was chosen to lead the country solely because he outranked every one else. Had Pérez Jiménez ordered the commander of the Caracas garrison to arrest any officer not at his post and to put the fear of volleys into the crowds, he would have been obeyed, so in some way it redounds to his credit that, like Medina Angarita before him, he ran because he did not want bloodshed, although Medina had not run at all but had been imprisoned and released. As soon as it became unmistakable that Pérez Jiménez was out, the exiled politicians started streaming in. Larrazábal was made head of a civilian-military junta. Overnight, without having lifted a finger to deserve it, Larrazábal became the idol of Caracas, though in the rest of Venezuela the pardos were still adecos to the tip of their tails. ==Venezuelan transition to democracy== 1958 marked a crucial year in Venezuelan contemporary history. Concise Encyclopeida Of World History, Larrazábal was a fluke. He had no more legitimacy than Pérez Jiménez and no sooner was the new government installed, committed to democratic elections before the end of the year, than the question of who really had overthrown Pérez Jiménez, the military uprising or the Caracas masses, became a disquieting issue. The original rebellious officers felt that they were entitled to rule and started brewing their own conspiracies. But Larrazábal was generally accepted as the leader of the armed forces. Most importantly, the political parties, which were busily rebuilding their national organizations, gave him their total support, including the few but vociferous communists. As before, it was Betancourt who proved the master organizer through his revived AD party. Another source of support for Larrazábal was that he decreed demagogic measures to conciliate the discontented masses. These measures were being legislated in an ad hoc manner and one in particular, the most influential, was completely irrational. A so- called Emergency Plan gave hand-outs to those who could claim they were unemployed. These popular subsidies were far above what the average Venezuelan earned in the rural areas and there followed inevitably a flood of migrants to Caracas, a city that before had few shantytowns, and settled and built shacks on the hillsides on the eastern and western edges of the valley in which Caracas nestles. The population of the city soon doubled with these rural, barely educated newcomers, who were obviously strongly pro-Larrazábal but were also a potential source of political de-stabilization. The pardos in effect became a force to be reckoned with in the forthcoming elections. But before these took place many things were occurring. The officers who felt they had been cheated staged various insurrections, even to an \\"invasion\\" by one of them from Colombia who managed to take over San Cristobal, the capital of Táchira state. All these conspiracies were contained although some required drastic means and at one point the Larrazábal government was in real danger of being toppled. The armed forces were instrumental in quelling the revolts, but each time there was one, Caracas mobs went wild prodded by the politicians. The most menacing of these popular riots took place in May 1958 when U.S. vice-president Richard Nixon and his wife Pat visited Venezuela. Nixon represented the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration, which had conferred on Pérez Jiménez the Legion of Merit. The Venezuelan government had not anticipated the raging public reaction to this emissary from Washington, possibly because it thought that it had assuaged public indignation by allowing the hysterical daily denigration of the former dictator. Venezuelans were not that versed in foreign affairs, but the communists were and it was at their instigation that crowds assaulted Nixon's motorcade along an avenue that ran close to where many shantytowns had grown, ironically not far from a huge apartment complex that Pérez Jiménez had built for workers. Before the Venezuelan army intervened—preventing a ready-to-go Marines intervention—Nixon's car had been rocked back and forth, its windows had been smashed, and the vice-president and his wife had been thoroughly drenched in spit. As would be expected, once safe in the American embassy residence, Nixon let loose with imprecations and he returned quickly to the U.S. It says well of him that when he reported on his trip, which was meant as a fact-finding and conciliatory gesture to Latin America, he stressed that his country was partly to blame for the unfriendly reception in Caracas. During the Cuban Revolution of the 1950s, a number of liberal organisations in Venezuela declared their support for Fidel Castro's guerrilla operations against Batista. The Venezuelan government refrained from taking a position on the Cuban rebellion, but unofficially during Larrazábal's Presidency contributed 50,000 dollars to Castro's revolutionaries.Liss, p 172. He cites Venezuela, Oficina Central de Información, Six Years of Aggression (Caracas, 1967), p 16. ===Elections=== As the elections approached, the three main parties, Democratic Action, COPEI and Democratic Republican Union (URD), initiated talks to form a united political front \\"in defence of democracy\\". This implied, if not a single candidate chosen among them, at least an understanding for future cooperation in ruling Venezuela. The pact, known as the Punto Fijo Pact (hence puntofijismo) remained essentially in place until Hugo Chávez' victory in 1998. The wily Betancourt, who sometimes is referred to as the \\"father of Venezuelan democracy\\" (much less in than before), insisted that the Communist Party of Venezuela were not to be included in the political talks, and excluded they were but took it very calmly. The chances of one candidate were slim and nothing came out of the negotiations except a well-meaning consensus that the parties would stick together in the defence of democracy from whatever threats might arise in the future. This meant that the electoral process was on and that each party had to look itself. Another significant pact that emerged during 1958 was the unspoken one by which the civilian political leadership, particularly Rómulo Betancourt, agreed not to interfere with the military in any way and let them run their own affairs. The military in their turn pledged that they would not allow politicization within their ranks — to the extent that they even renounced their own right to vote (voting became compulsory for the rest of the Venezuelans). AD knew that it remained the most popular party all over Venezuela: it chose Betancourt as its candidate. Rafael Caldera had no rivals in COPEI, the party he founded, and he entered the political fray counting on the conservative middle class. Jóvito Villalba and his URD party adopted an opportunistic strategy, which was practically an admission that they could not compete with the AD national pardo popular base. It was the pardo masses in Caracas that Villalba was targeting when, instead of nominating himself, he chose Larrazábal, who also had the communists with him, to be the URD candidate. Larrazábal turned over the provisional presidency to a civilian, Edgar Sanabria, in October, and went on the campaign trail. When the results were in, Betancourt was elected for the term that ended in 1964, but this time by a plurality and not the absolute majorities that AD had achieved in 1946 and 1947. Caracas was no longer an AD redoubt. The city from then on became a marginal that could swing in any direction and this time it went all out for Larrazábal, who came in second. Caldera did not do badly in third place and received proportionally more votes than he had in 1947. But the Venezuelan panorama was cloudy at best. ==References== Category:History of Venezuela by period Category:20th century in Venezuela Venezuela ","title":"History of Venezuela (1948–1958)"},{"id":"35891038","text":", better known by the ring name , is a Japanese professional wrestler, currently signed by Pro Wrestling Zero1.

On July 8, 2006, Hino received his first shot at the Strongest-K Championship, but was defeated by Joe. On January 7, 2007, Hino won his first title, when he and stablemate Saburo Inematsu defeated Joe and Yasu Urano for the Strongest-K Tag Team Championship. After two successful title defenses, Hino and Inematsu lost the title to Miyawaki and Yoshiya on May 6. On July 8, Hino turned on the New Standard and joined the villainous Omega stable by helping its members Miyawaki and Yoshiya successfully defend the Strongest-K Tag Team Championship against Kazma and Ryota Chikuzen. Omega also included Makoto Oishi and Shiori Asahi. On August 12, Hino made it to the finals of his second Strongest-K Tournament, but was again defeated there, this time by Taka Michinoku. On October 14, Hino, Asahi and Oishi won the Taj Mahal Cup Scramble 1-Day 6 Person Tag Team Tournament.

On April 13, 2008, at ev.7, Kaientai Dojo's largest annual event, Hino defeated Kengo Mashimo in the main event to win the Strongest-K Championship for the first time. Hino made his first successful title defense on May 6, defeating former Omega stablemate Yoshiya, which was followed by another successful defense on June 12 against Madoka. On August 9, Hino lost the title back to Kengo Mashimo in his third title defense, ending his reign at 118 days. At the end of the year, the August 9 match was named Kaientai Dojo's 2008 Match of the Year. In February 2009, Hino and Saburo Inematsu made it to the finals of the Kaientai Dojo Tag League, but were there defeated by Hiro Tonai and Taishi Takizawa. On June 19, Hino defeated Kengo Mashimo and Shiori Asahi in the finals to win the 1-Day 3-Way Tournament. On November 14, Hino received a rematch for the Strongest-K Championship, but was unable to dethrone the defending champion, Kazma.

Hino's impressive 2010 continued the following summer, when, on July 11, he defeated Kengo Mashimo in the finals to win the 2010 Strongest-K Tournament. As a result, Hino was granted a shot at the Strongest-K Championship, which he went on to win, defeating Kazma on August 15. On October 17, Hino's stable Omega decided to mutually disband. On November 23, Hino made his first successful defense of the Strongest-K Championship, defeating tag team partner Saburo Inematsu. On December 25, Hino also successfully defended the title against Taishi Takizawa.

After a year-long reign, Hino and Inematsu lost the WEW Hardcore Tag Team Championship to Kengo Mashimo and Ryuichi Sekine on March 20, 2011. On April 17 at evolution9, Hino made his third successful defense of the Strongest-K Championship, defeating Canadian Quiet Storm.

At the end of the year, Hino was awarded his third Match of the Year accolade for his Strongest-K Championship match against Kengo Mashimo. In early 2012, Hino began once again teaming regularly with Saburo Inematsu, which led to the two defeating Kengo Mashimo and Taka Michinoku on May 6 to win the Strongest-K Tag Team Championship for the third time. They went on to lose the title to Hiro Tonai and Shiori Asahi on June 17. On July 8, Hino wrestled in a special main event, where he was defeated by freelancer Daisuke Sekimoto. On July 29, Hino entered a special tournament, which was set to determine a new top stable in Kaientai Dojo. In the first round of the tournament, Hino and Ayumu Honda were defeated by Shiori Asahi and Yuki Sato. As the winners of the match, Asahi and Sato were given the right to recruit one of the losers as part of their stable, and chose Hino to join them. Later that same event, Hino, Asahi and Sato were defeated in the semifinals by Hiro Tonai, Kaji Tomato and Jonathan Bada. Once again, the winners chose Hino to join their stable. In the finals, Hino, Tonai, Tomato and Bada defeated Crazy Mary, Ryuichi Sekine, Saburo Inematsu and Yoshiya to win the tournament, forming the new stable named Uchuu Puroresu Kyoukai.

On January 26, 2013, Hino teamed with Saburo Inematsu to unsuccessfully challenge Kengo Mashimo and Ryuichi Sekine for the Strongest-K Tag Team Championship. On April 14, Hino lost the Strongest-K Championship to Taishi Takizawa in the main event of evolution11. In September, Hino announced that he would undergo surgery on his right elbow following October 6, which would sideline him for the next few months. On October 6, Hino produced his own event, which celebrated his tenth anniversary in professional wrestling. During the event, Hino wrestled three times; first in the opening six-man tag team match, where he, Antonio Honda and Daisuke Sasaki were defeated by Hikaru Sato, Kengo Mashimo and Yukio Sakaguchi, and later in the scheduled main event, an Omega reunion match, where he, Makoto Oishi and Shiori Asahi defeated Hiroki, Ryota Chikuzen and Taka Michinoku. Following the main event, Hino also wrestled Quiet Storm to a five-minute time limit draw. Hino was expected to return for Kaientai Dojo's big New Year's Eve event, but on November 19, he announced that his surgery had not produced desired results, forcing him to remain sidelined. Hino returned to the ring on January 26, 2014, when he teamed with Hiroki in a tag team match, where they defeated Ryuichi Sekine and Tank Nagai, pinning Sekine for the win. On February 16, Hino and Hiroki defeated Hiro Tonai and Yuki Sato in the finals to win the 2014 Bo-so Golden Tag Tournament. This led to a match on March 2, where Hino and Hiroki defeated Kaji Tomato and Taka Michinoku to win the Strongest-K Tag Team Championship. On November 3, Hino and the renamed Hi69 lost the Strongest-K Tag Team Championship to Kaji Tomato and Shiori Asahi. On April 12, 2015, Hino defeated Kengo Mashimo to win the Strongest-K Championship for the fourth time. He lost the title to Tank Nagai on September 6. On October 27, Kaientai Dojo announced Hino's resignation from the promotion. In a press conference on November 1, it was announced that Hino would continue his career as a freelancer. ===DDT Pro-Wrestling (2009, 2011–2014)=== On November 3, 2009, Hino made his debut for DDT Pro-Wrestling, teaming with Shiori Asahi in a tag team match, where they faced Harashima and Yukihiro Abe. On September 18, 2011, Hino returned to DDT, teaming with Ryuichi Sekine to defeat Shigehiro Irie and Soma Takao in a tag team match. On November 27, 2011, Hino began working regularly for DDT, when he formed the Crying Wolf stable with Antonio Honda, Keita Yano and Yasu Urano. In their first match together, the four defeated Daisuke Sasaki, Masa Takanashi, Mikami and Soma Takao in an eight-man tag team match, with Hino pinning Sasaki for the win. Crying Wolf remained undefeated for the remainder of the year, culminating on December 31, when Hino and Urano defeated Keisuke Ishii and Shigehiro Irie to win the KO-D Tag Team Championship. At the following event on January 8, 2012, Crying Wolf suffered its first loss, when Daisuke Sasaki pinned Urano in an eight-man tag team match. This led to a match on January 22, where Hino and Urano successfully defended the KO-D Tag Team Championship against Sasaki and Masa Takanashi. On February 11, Hino and Urano made another successful title defense, defeating Ishii and Irie in a rematch, which was followed eight days later by them also successfully defending the title against Makoto Oishi and Masao Inoue. On March 11, Hino and Urano lost the KO-D Tag Team Championship to Sanshiro Takagi and Soma Takao. On April 1, Hino, Urano and Keita Yano entered the annual Anytime and Anywhere battle royal, a match combining elements of a regular battle royal and a ladder match. Yano exited the match, after Hino helped him grab one of the letters hanging over the ring, giving him the right to book his own DDT event. Eventually, the match came down to Hino and Urano, with Hino pinning his tag team partner for the win to earn the first shot at the new KO-D Openweight Champion, Masa Takanashi. Before the match with Takanashi took place, Hino and Urano regained the KO-D Tag Team Championship from Takagi and Takao on April 15. On May 4, Hino defeated Takanashi to also become the new KO-D Openweight Champion. Nine days later, Hino and Urano made their first successful defense of the KO-D Tag Team Championship by defeating Danshoku Dino and Kota Ibushi. On May 27, Hino defeated Harashima for his first successful defense of the KO-D Openweight Championship. On June 3, Hino and Urano defeated Gentaro and Tomomitsu Matsunaga to make their second successful defense of the KO-D Tag Team Championship. On June 16, Hino and Urano lost the title to Kudo and Makoto Oishi. On June 24, Hino lost the KO-D Openweight Championship to Kota Ibushi, suffering his first direct pinfall loss in DDT in the process. On July 8, Hino formed the Monster Army stable with Antonio Honda, Daisuke Sasaki, Hoshitango, Masa Takanashi and Yasu Urano. The group employed a military theme as each member was given a rank, with Hino taking the rank of a sergeant. On July 15, Hino and Urano received a rematch for the KO-D Tag Team Championship, but were again defeated by Kudo and Oishi. On July 22, the Monster Army was disbanded and split up into two opposing camps, Hino, Honda and Urano, again known as Crying Wolf, and Takanashi, Sasaki and Hoshitango, known as Familia. Crying Wolf disbanded on September 19, when Antonio Honda turned on Yasu Urano in the aftermath of DDT General Manager Amon Tsurumi ordering all stables in the promotion disbanded. Hino was then announced as a member of a new stable formed by Masa Takanashi and Toru Owashi. However, in his first match as a member of Takanashi's stable on September 30, Hino turned on Takanashi and joined Antonio Honda, Daisuke Sasaki and Hoshitango to reform the Monster Army, with Honda claiming that Takanashi and Urano were the ones who ruined the original stable. DDT's 2012 ended with a storyline, where Sanshiro Takagi brought in the New Japan Pro Wrestling tag team of Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Satoshi Kojima to stop the Monster Army, in particular Antonio Honda, who had begun stealing other wrestlers' clothes. At the final event of the year on December 23, the entire Monster Army was defeated in a four-on-three handicap match by Takagi, Tenzan and Kojima, after which Hino, Honda, Sasaki and Hoshitango were all supposedly arrested by the New Japan duo. On January 27, 2013, Hino's 28th birthday, he, Honda and Sasaki defeated Team Drift (Keisuke Ishii, Shigehiro Irie and Soma Takao) to win the KO-D 6-Man Tag Team Championship. They made their first successful title defense on March 20 against the team of Danshoku Dino, Gabai-Ji-chan and Makoto Oishi. On April 13, the Monster Army made another successful title defense against Dino, Oishi and Alpha Female. On May 26, the Monster Army lost the KO-D 6-Man Tag Team Championship to Golden☆Rendezvous～ (Gota Ihashi, Kenny Omega and Kota Ibushi) in their third defense. On June 2, Hino teamed with Hoshitango to unsuccessfully challenge Hikaru Sato and Yukio Sakaguchi for the KO-D Tag Team Championship. On June 23, Monster Army, with Hoshitango replacing Daisuke Sasaki, regained the KO-D 6-Man Tag Team Championship from Golden☆Rendezvous～. However, the three lost the title in their first defense on July 21 to the team of Danshoku Dino, Kensuke Sasaki and Makoto Oishi. After recovering from an elbow surgery, Hino returned to DDT on March 21, 2014, to take part in Monster Army's final match together, where he, Honda, Sasaki and Hoshitango defeated Gorgeous Matsuno, Gota Ihashi, Sanshiro Takagi and Toru Owashi. ===Wrestle-1 (2014, 2015–2019)=== On January 31, 2014, Hino made his debut for Wrestle-1, declaring a war on the entire promotion, before defeating Kai in a singles match. On March 22, Hino defeated Yasufumi Nakanoue in a singles match, after which he deemed his opponent \\"weak\\", starting a storyline rivalry between the two. Hino's entry to Wrestle-1 also led to interpromotional matches between Kaientai Dojo and Wrestle-1, including a match on April 13 at Kaientai Dojo's twelfth anniversary event, where Hino and Hiroki successfully defended the Strongest-K Tag Team Championship against Kaz Hayashi and Shuji Kondo. Back in Wrestle-1 four days later, Hino and Hiroki suffered an upset loss in a non-title match against Nakanoue and rookie Seiki Yoshioka. This led to a match at Wrestle-1's May 4 event, where Hino and Hiroki successfully defended the Strongest-K Tag Team Championship against Nakanoue and Yoshioka. Following the match, Hino, noting that he held victories over Kai, Kaz Hayashi and Shuji Kondo, declared himself the ace of Wrestle-1 and later in the event attacked Kai, after he had made his own claim for the title. On May 22, Hino suffered his first direct loss in Wrestle-1, when he was defeated by Kai. On November 27, 2015, Hino returned to Wrestle-1 as the newest member of the Real Desperado stable. On January 10, 2016, he defeated Manabu Soya to become the new Wrestle-1 Champion. He made his first successful title defense on February 10 against Minoru Tanaka. After the match, Shuji Kondo entered the ring and challenged Hino to a title match, which resulted in Hino making his own challenge for Kondo's Wrestle-1 Tag Team Championship. On March 6, Hino became a double champion, when he and Real Desperado stablemate Kazma Sakamoto defeated Kondo and Masayuki Kono for the Wrestle-1 Tag Team Championship. This was followed by Hino making his second successful defense of the Wrestle-1 Championship against Kondo on March 13. On May 4, Hino lost the Wrestle-1 Championship to Kai in his third defense. On June 8, Hino and Sakamoto lost the Wrestle-1 Tag Team Championship to Yasufumi Nakanoue and Yuji Okabayashi in their third defense. Over the next month, Hino made it to the finals of the 2016 Wrestle-1 Grand Prix, but was defeated there on July 1 by Manabu Soya. ===Other promotions=== Hino at Takayamania 2018 In July 2004, Hino made his debut for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), working the Summer Action Series 2004 tour. On May 2, 2014, Hino defeated Takashi Sasaki to win Pro Wrestling Freedoms' King of Freedom World Championship. After successfully defending the title against Minoru Fujita on July 24, he lost the title to Jun Kasai on September 15. In September 2015, Hino returned to AJPW, taking part in the annual Ōdō Tournament. After defeating Zeus in his first round match and Yoshinobu Kanemaru in his second round match, Hino was eliminated from the tournament in the semifinals by eventual tournament winner, Jun Akiyama. ==Championships and accomplishments== *DDT Pro-Wrestling **KO-D 6-Man Tag Team Championship (2 times) – with Antonio Honda and Daisuke Sasaki (1), and Antonio Honda and Hoshitango (1) **KO-D Openweight Championship (1 time) **KO-D Tag Team Championship (2 times) – with Yasu Urano *Kaientai Dojo **Chiba 6 Man Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Bambi and Ricky Fuji **Strongest-K Championship (4 times) **Strongest-K Tag Team Championship (4 times) – with Saburo Inematsu (3) and Hiroki/Hi69 (1) **WEW Hardcore Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Saburo Inematsu **1-Day 3-Way Tournament (2009) **Bo-so Golden Tag Tournament (2014) – with Hiroki **Kaientai Dojo Tag League (2010) – with Shiori Asahi **Special Unit Formation Tournament (2012) – with Hiro Tonai, Kaji Tomato and Jonathan Bada **Strongest-K Tournament (2010) **Taj Mahal Cup Scramble 1-Day 6 Person Tag Team Tournament (2007) – with Makoto Oishi and Shiori Asahi **Newcomer of the Year (2004) **Singles Match of the Year (2008) vs. Kengo Mashimo on August 9 **Singles Match of the Year (2010) vs. Kazma on August 15 **Singles Match of the Year (2011) vs. Kengo Mashimo on June 18 **Singles Match of the Year (2012) vs. Daisuke Sekimoto on November 13 **Singles Match of the Year (2013) vs. Kengo Mashimo on July 15 **Singles Match of the Year (2015) vs. Kengo Mashimo on February 22 **Tag Team Match of the Year (2014) with Hi69 vs. Kaji Tomato and Shiori Asahi on November 3 **Wrestler of the Year (2010, 2012) *Pro Wrestling Freedoms **King of Freedom World Championship (1 time) *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **PWI ranked him #232 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2016 *Pro Wrestling Noah **GHC Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Maybach Taniguchi *Pro Wrestling Zero1 **NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Masato Tanaka **World Heavyweight Championship (1 time, current) **Fire Festival (2019) **Furinkazan (2019) – with Yuji Okabayashi *Wrestle-1 **Wrestle-1 Championship (1 time) **Wrestle-1 Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Kazma Sakamoto ==References *Kaientai Dojo profile *Wrestle-1 profile *Official blog Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese male professional wrestlers Category:People from Hirakata Category:Sportspeople from Osaka Prefecture ","title":"Yuji Hino"},{"id":"35891044","text":"The third and final season of Body of Proof, an American television series created by Christopher Murphey, aired in the United States from February 19, 2013 to May 28, 2013 and consisted of 13 episodes.

It was then announced that Sonja Sohn would not return to the series, as her character wasn't going to be asked back for another season. In August 2012, it was announced that Mark Valley was tapped to play the lead male detective in the new season, as Tommy Sullivan, a former love interest of Megan's. Just as it was announced that Mark Valley would be joining the series, it was announced that Elyes Gabel would be joining the cast as Adam Lucas, a new police detective and Tommy's partner. All other cast members, including Dana Delany, Jeri Ryan, Geoffrey Arend, Windell Middlebrooks and Mary Mouser, are expected to return in their series regular slots. Both Jeffrey Nordling and Joanna Cassidy are expected to remain as recurring characters throughout the season. In August 2012, it was announced that Annie Wersching had been cast as Yvonne Kurtz in a recurring role. Luke Perry reprises his Season 2 role as Charlie Stafford in multiple episodes, his character having now been promoted to county health commissioner. In September 2012, it was announced that Michael Nouri was to guest star in an episode as Daniel Russo, and that Ray Wise and Derek Webster are expected to guest star, while Tim DeKay had been cast in an unknown guest spot. In October 2012, it was announced that Desperate Housewives actor Richard Burgi had been cast in a recurring role as Dan Russell, a Philadelphia DA who tries to convince Kate to run for political office. It was also reported that Charmed actor Ivan Sergei had been tapped to play Sergei, a potential love interest for Kate. It was also announced that Henry Ian Cusick is set to play Trent Marsh as a guest star. Tony Von Halle and Jenny Lin are both reported to have booked guest roles as Mark McDaniels and an Intern respectively. In November 2012, it was announced that Lorraine Toussaint had been cast as Angela Martin. In December 2012, it was reported that Brothers & Sisters star, Sarah Jane Morris, had been cast as a flight attendant named Pamela Jacks. ===Development=== Body of Proof was officially picked up for a third season with a 13 episode order, and was set to premiere sometime mid- season. In December 2012, it was announced that the season would premiere on February 5, 2013 on Tuesdays at 10pm. But in January 2013, it was announced that the premiere had been moved from February 5 to February 19, so that the network would be able to air all thirteen episodes in a row without being pre- empted by a speech that Barack Obama, the just-re-elected President of the United States, was slated to make on February 12. In January 2013, during an interview, it was announced that story-lines for the season would include Kate going into politics, and that Megan would be probing more deeply into her father's suicide, for which she would most likely get closure by the season finale. ==EpisodesRatingsLive ratings=== {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\" - !

In order to obtain this effect the light intensity must vary, either periodically (modulated light) or as a single flash (pulsed light).Rosencwaig, A. (1980) Photoacoustics and photoacoustic spectroscopy. Chemical Analysis: a Series of Monographs on Analytical Chemistry and Its Applications, Vol. 57. New York:John Wiley & Sons, . The photoacoustic effect is quantified by measuring the formed sound (pressure changes) with appropriate detectors, such as microphones or piezoelectric sensors. The time variation of the electric output (current or voltage) from these detectors is the photoacoustic signal. These measurements are useful to determine certain properties of the studied sample. For example, in photoacoustic spectroscopy, the photoacoustic signal is used to obtain the actual absorption of light in either opaque or transparent objects. It is useful for substances in extremely low concentrations, because very strong pulses of light from a laser can be used to increase sensitivity and very narrow wavelengths can be used for specificity. Furthermore, photoacoustic measurements serve as a valuable research tool in the study of the heat evolved in photochemical reactions (see: photochemistry), particularly in the study of photosynthesis. Most generally, electromagnetic radiation of any kind can give rise to a photoacoustic effect. This includes the whole range of electromagnetic frequencies, from gamma radiation and X-rays to microwave and radio. Still, much of the reported research and applications, utilizing the photoacoustic effect, is concerned with the near ultraviolet/visible and infrared spectral regions. ==History== The discovery of the photoacoustic effect dates back to 1880, when Alexander Graham Bell was experimenting with long-distance sound transmission. Through his invention, called \\"photophone\\", he transmitted vocal signals by reflecting sun-light from a moving mirror to a selenium solar cell receiver. As a byproduct of this investigation, he observed that sound waves were produced directly from a solid sample when exposed to beam of sunlight that was rapidly interrupted with a rotating slotted wheel. He noticed that the resulting acoustic signal was dependent on the type of the material and correctly reasoned that the effect was caused by the absorbed light energy, which subsequently heats the sample. Later Bell showed that materials exposed to the non-visible (ultra-violet and infra-red) portions of the solar spectrum can also produce sounds and invented a device, which he called \\"spectrophone\\", to apply this effect for spectral identification of materials. Bell himself and later John Tyndall and Wilhelm Röntgen extended these experiments, demonstrating the same effect in liquids and gases. However, the results were too crude, dependent on ear detection, and this technique was soon abandoned. The application of the photoacoustic effect had to wait until the development of sensitive sensors and intense light sources. In 1938 Mark Leonidovitch Veingerov revived the interest in the photoacoustic effect, being able to use it in order to measure very small carbon dioxide concentration in nitrogen gas (as low as 0.2% in volume). Since then research and applications grew faster and wider, acquiring several fold more detection sensitivity. While the heating effect of the absorbed radiation was considered to be the prime cause of the photoacoustic effect, it was shown in 1978 that gas evolution resulting from a photochemical reaction can also cause a photoacoustic effect. Independently, considering the apparent anomalous behaviour of the photoacoustic signal from a plant leaf, which could not be explained solely by the heating effect of the exciting light, led to the cognition that photosynthetic oxygen evolution is normally a major contributor to the photoacoustic signal in this case. ==Physical mechanisms Photothermal mechanism=== Although much of the literature on the subject is concerned with just one mechanism, there are actually several different mechanisms that produce the photoacoustic effect. The primary universal mechanism is photothermal, based on the heating effect of the light and the consequent expansion of the light-absorbing material. In detail, the photothermal mechanism consists of the following stages: # conversion of the absorbed pulsed or modulated radiation into heat energy. # temporal changes of the temperatures at the loci where radiation is absorbed – rising as radiation is absorbed and falling when radiation stops and the system cools. # expansion and contraction following these temperature changes, which are \\"translated\\" to pressure changes. The pressure changes, which occur in the region where light was absorbed, propagate within the sample body and can be sensed by a sensor coupled directly to it. Commonly, for the case of a condensed phase sample (liquid, solid), pressure changes are rather measured in the surrounding gaseous phase (commonly air), formed there by the diffusion of the thermal pulsations. The main physical picture, in this case, envisions the original temperature pulsations as origins of propagating temperature waves (\\"thermal waves\\"), which travel in the condensed phase, ultimately reaching the surrounding gaseous phase. The resulting temperature pulsations in the gaseous phase are the prime cause of the pressure changes there. The amplitude of the traveling thermal wave decreases strongly (exponentially) along its propagation direction, but if its propagation distance in the condensed phase is not too long, its amplitude near the gaseous phase is sufficient to create detectable pressure changes. This property of the thermal wave confers unique features to the detection of light absorption by the photoacoustic method. The temperature and pressure changes involved are minute, compared to everyday scale – typical order of magnitude for the temperature changes, using ordinary light intensities, is about micro- to millidegrees and for the resulting pressure changes is about nano- to microbars. The photothermal mechanism manifests itself, besides the photoacoustic effect, also by other physical changes, notably emission of infra-red radiation and changes in the refraction index. Correspondingly, it may be detected by various other means, described by terms such as \\"photothermal radiometry\\", \\"thermal lens\\"Thermal Lens Spectroscopy. photonics.cusat.edu and \\"thermal beam deflection\\" (popularly also known as \\"mirage\\" effect, see Photothermal spectroscopy). These methods parallel the photoacoustic detection. However, each method has its special range of application. ===Other=== While the photothermal mechanism is universal, there could exist additional other mechanisms, superimposed on the photothermal mechanism, which may contribute significantly to the photoacoustic signal. These mechanisms are generally related to photophysical processes and photochemical reactions following light absorption: (1) change in the material balance of the sample or the gaseous phase around the sample; (2) change in the molecular organization, which results in molecular volume changes.Schulenberg, C.P.J. and Braslavsky, S.E. (1997) \\"Time-Resolved Photothermal Studies with Biological Supramoleculear Systems\\", pp. 57–81 in Progress in Photothermal and Photoacoustic Science and Technology Vol. III. A. Mandelis, and P. Hess (eds.). SPIE Optical Engineering Press Most prominent examples for these two kinds of mechanisms are in photosynthesis Malkin, S. (1995) \\"The photoacoustic method – monitoring and analysis of phenomena which lead to pressure changes following light excitation\\", pp. 191–206 in Biophysical methods in photosynthesis. J. Amesz and A.J. Hoff (eds.) Advances in Photosynthesis. Vol. III. Kluwer The first mechanism above is mostly conspicuous in a photosynthesizing plant leaf. There, the light induced oxygen evolution causes pressure changes in the air phase, resulting in a photoacoustic signal, which is comparable in magnitude to that caused by the photothermal mechanism. This mechanism was tentatively named \\"photobaric\\". The second mechanism shows up in photosynthetically active sub-cell complexes in suspension (e.g. photosynthetic reaction centers). There, the electric field which is formed in the reaction center, following the light induced electron transfer process, causes a micro electrostriction effect with a change in the molecular volume. This, in turn, induces a pressure wave which propagates in the macroscopic medium. Another case for this mechanism is Bacteriorhodopsin proton pump. Here the light induced change in the molecular volume is caused by conformational changes that occur in this protein following light absorption. ==Detection of the photoacoustic effect== In applying the photoacoustic effect there exist various modes of measurement. Gaseous samples or condensed phase samples, where the pressure is measured in the surrounding gaseous phase, are usually probed with a microphone. The useful applicable time-scale in this case is in the millisecond to sub-second scale. Most often, In this case, the exciting light is continuously chopped or modulated at a certain frequency (mostly in the range between ca. 10–10000 Hz) and the modulated photoacoustic signal is analyzed with a lock-in amplifier for its amplitude and phase, or for the inphase and quadrature components. When the pressure is measured within the condensed phase of the probed specimen, one utilizes piezoelectric sensors inserted into or coupled to the specimen itself. In this case the time scale is between less than nanoseconds to many microseconds The photoacoustic signal, obtained from the various pressure sensors, depends on the physical properties of the system, the mechanism that creates the photoacoustic signal, the light-absorbing material, the dynamics of the excited state relaxation and the modulation frequency or the pulse profile of the radiation, as well as the sensor properties. This calls for appropriate procedures to (i) separate between the signals due to different mechanisms and (ii) to obtain the time dependence of the heat evolution (in the case of the photothermal mechanism) or the oxygen evolution (in the case of the photobaric mechanism in photosynthesis) or the time dependence of the volume changes, from the time dependence of the resulting photoacoustic signal. ==Applications== Considering the photothermal mechanism alone, the photoacoustic signal is useful in measuring the light absorption spectrum, particularly for transparent samples where the light absorption is very small. In this case the ordinary method of absorption spectroscopy, based on difference of the intensities of a light beam before and after its passage through the sample, is not practical. In photoacoustic spectroscopy there is no such limitation. the signal is directly related to the light absorption and the light intensity. Dividing the signal spectrum by the light intensity spectrum can give a relative percent absorption spectrum, which can be calibrated to yield absolute values. This is very useful to detect very small concentrations of various materials.Harren, F. J. M.; Cotti, G.; Oomens, J. and te Lintel Hekkert, S. (2000) \\"Environment: Trace Gas Monitoring\\", pp. 2203–2226 in Encyclopedia of Analytical Chemistry, M. W. Sigrist and R. A. Meyers (eds.) Vol. 3 Photoacoustic spectroscopy is also useful for the opposite case of opaque samples, where the absorption is essentially complete. In an arrangement where a sensor is placed in a gaseous phase above the sample and the light impinges the sample from above, the photoacoustic signal results from an absorption zone close to the surface. A typical parameter which governs the signal in this case is the \\"thermal diffusion length\\", which depends on the material and the modulation frequency and ordinarily is in the order of several micrometers. The signal is related to the light absorbed in the small distance of the thermal diffusion length, allowing the determination of the absorption spectrum. This allows also to separately analyze a surface that is distinct from the bulk. By varying the modulation frequency and wavelength of the probing radiation one essentially varies the probed depth, which results in the possibility of depth profiling and photoacoustic imaging, which discloses inhomogeneities within the sample. This analysis includes also the possibility to determine the thermal properties from the photoacoustic signal. Recently, the photoacoustic approach has been utilized to quantitatively measure macromolecules, such as proteins. The photoacoustic immunoassay labels and detects target proteins using nanoparticles that can generate strong acoustic signals. The photoacoustics-based protein analysis has also been applied for point-of-care testings. Another application of the photoacoustic effect is its ability to estimate the chemical energies stored in various steps of a photochemical reaction. Following light absorption photophysical and photochemical conversions occur, which store part of the light energy as chemical energy. Energy storage leads to less heat evolution. The resulting smaller photoacoustic signal thus gives a quantitative estimate of the extent of the energy storage. For transient species this requires the measurement of the signal in the relevant time scale and the capability to extract from the temporal part of the signal the time-dependent heat evolution, by proper deconvolution. There are numerous examples for this application. A similar application is the study of the conversion of light energy to electrical energy in solar cells. A special example is the application of the photoacoustic effect in photosynthesis research. ==Photoacoustic effect in photosynthesis== Photosynthesis is a very suitable platform to be investigated by the photoacoustic effect, providing many examples to its various uses. As noted above, the photoacoustic signal from wet photosynthesizing specimens (e.g. microalgae in suspension, sea weed) is principally photothermal. The photoacoustic signal from spongy structures (leaves, lichens) is a combination of photothermal and photobaric (gas evolution or uptake) contributions. The photoacoustic signal from preparations which carry out the primary electron transfer reactions (e.g. reaction centers) is a combination of photothermal and molecular volume changes contributions. In each case, respectively, photoacoustic measurements provided information on * Energy storage (i.e. the fraction of light energy which is converted to chemical energy in the photosynthetic process; * The extent and dynamics of the gas evolution and uptake from leaves or lichens. Most usually it is photosynthetic oxygen evolution which contributes to the photoacoustic signal; Carbon dioxide uptake is a slow process and does not show up in photoacoustic measurements. Under very specific conditions, however, the photoacoustic signal becomes transiently negative, presumably reflecting oxygen uptake. However, this needs more verification; * Molecular volume changes, which occur during the primary steps of photosynthetic electron transfer. These measurements provided information related to the mechanism of photosynthesis, as well as give indications on the intactness and health of the specimen. Examples are: (a) the energetics of the primary electron transfer processes, obtained from the energy storage and molecular volume change measured under sub-microsecond flashes; (b) The characteristics of the 4-step oxidation cycle in photosystem II, obtained for leaves by monitoring photoacoustic pulsed signals and their oscillatory behavior under repetitive exciting light flashes; (c) the characteristics of photosystem I and photosystem II of photosynthesis (absorption spectrum, light distribution to the two photosystems) and their interactions. This is obtained by using continuously modulated light of a certain specific wavelength to excite the photoacoustic signal and measure changes in energy storage and oxygen evolution caused by background light at various chosen wavelengths. In general, photoacoustic measurements of energy storage require a reference sample for comparison. It is a sample with exactly the same light absorption (at the given excitation wavelength) but which completely degrades all the absorbed light into heat within the time resolution of the measurement. It is lucky that photosynthetic systems are self-calibrating, providing such a reference in one sample, as follows: One compares two signals: one, which is obtained with the probing modulated/pulsed light alone and the other when a steady non-modulated light (referred to as background light), which is strong enough to drive photosynthesis into saturation, is added. The added steady light does not produce any photoacoustic effect by itself, but changes the photoacoustic response due to the modulated/pulsed probing light. The resulting signal serves as a reference to all other measurements in absence of the background light. The photothermal part of the reference signal is maximal, since at photosynthetic saturation no energy is stored. At the same time the contribution of the other mechanisms tends to zero at saturation. Thus the reference signal is proportional to the total absorbed light energy. In order to separate and define the photobaric and photothermal contributions in spongy samples (leaves, lichens) one uses the following properties of the photoacoustic signal: (1) At low frequencies (below roughly 100 Hz) the photobaric part of the photoacoustic signal may be quite large and the total signal decreases under the background light. The photobaric signal is obtained in principle from the difference of signals (the total signal minus the reference signal, after a correction to account for the energy storage). (2) At sufficiently high frequencies, however, the photobaric signal is very much attenuated in comparison with the photothermal component and can be neglected. Also, no photobaric signal can be observed even at low frequencies in a leaf with its inner air space filled with water. This is true also in live algal thalli, suspensions of microalgae and photosynthetic bacteria. This is because the photobaric signal depends on oxygen diffusion from the photosynthetic membranes to the air phase, and is largely attenuated as the diffusion distance in the aqueous medium increases. In all the above instances when no photobaric signal is observed one may determine the energy storage by comparing the photoacoustic signal obtained with the probing light alone, to the reference signal. The parameters obtained from the above measurements are used in a variety of ways. Energy storage and the intensity of the photobaric signal are related to the efficiency of photosynthesis and can be used to monitor and follow the health of photosynthesizing organisms. They are also used to obtain mechanistic insight on the photosynthetic process: light of different wavelengths allows one to obtain the efficiency spectrum of photosynthesis, the light distribution between the two photosystems of photosynthesis and to identify different taxa of phytoplankton. The use of pulsed lasers gives thermodynamic and kinetic information on the primary electron transfer steps of photosynthesis. ==See also== *Microwave auditory effect == References == Category:Acoustics Category:Spectroscopy Category:Medical diagnosis ","title":"Photoacoustic effect"},{"id":"35891058","text":"Gerd Frickhöffer (November 21, 1913 – July 4, 1980) was a German film and television actor.

Lordy Tugade drilled three straight triples to push the Thunder to within 98-101, but wrong decisions in the end dash their bid, Tugade converted a twinner with three seconds left instead of shooting a potential game-tying triple. ===Game 2=== Tony Lang turn in a game-high 37 points and joined hands with Willie Miller in the final half to power the Thunder to a victory and redeem himself from a lackluster 14-point output in the first game of the series. Willie Miller, Jimwell Torion and Junthy Valenzuela scored crucial three-pointers in the third and fourth quarter with Miller knocking in 11 of his 14 points in that span, including three triples that broke the backs of the Phone Pals, which lost Victor Pablo early in the game due to a knee injury when he fell on his back while trying to stop Junthy Valenzuela underneath the basket. ===Game 3=== Jerald Honeycutt came up with his third consecutive double-double performance of 26 points and 13 rebounds while Pete Mickeal finished with 21 markers, four of which dealt the killer blows on the Thunder, Mickeal's short jumper and two free throws off a foul by Julius Nwosu capped a remarkable night for the Phone Pals. ===Game 4=== Willie Miller fended off the Phone Pals' last-ditch effort after sinking both of his free throws and knocking in a decisive triple in the final minute to save the Thunder from a total collapse after posting 20-point margins three-fourths of the way before the Phone Pals' uprising. Sean Lampley, who replaces Tony Lang on a short notice, finished with 22 points and 9 rebounds. ===Game 5=== A 25-10 run by the Phone Pals broke the 30-all count at halftime and allow them to settle comfortably on a 55-40 advantage entering the fourth quarter. The Thunder's miscues and lethargic plays in which the Phone Pals forced them to costly turnovers saw the previous lowest output in a championship game set by Alaska in 2000 were shattered as Red Bull finished the game with only 55 points. ===Game 6=== Donbel Belano, Gilbert Demape and Jerald Honeycutt made their shots from the outside as the Phone Pals' three-point shooting clicked to keep them ahead, 43-39, in the first half. ===Game 7=== Jimwell Torion drained a game-clinching triple with 1:31 left that found its mark and dashed the hopes of the Phone Pals, the tough defense put up by both teams resulted to an all-time low combined total of 127 points in the final game and the lowest winning output of 67 Willie Miller won on his first sophomore Finals MVP and Batang Red Bull captures on his 2 peat back to back champion title. { class= style=\\"text-align:center; margin:auto\\" !2002 PBA Commissioner's Cup Champions -  Batang Red Bull Thunder Second title } ==RosterBroadcast notes== {class= - !Game !!

For 600 years the island was a centre of monastic life for Irish Christian monks. It is one of Europe's better known but least accessible monasteries. Since the extreme remoteness, it has until recently discouraged visitors, thus the site is exceptionally well preserved. The very spartan conditions inside the monastery illustrate the ascetic lifestyle practiced by early Irish Christians. The monks lived in stone 'beehive' huts (clocháns), perched above nearly vertical cliff walls.https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/757 - } ==Tentative list== The Ireland tentative list comprises sites which

DLT is located on Bolshaya Konyushennaya street 21-23 just north of Nevsky Prospekt. ==History== The land upon which DLT stands was originally developed in the 18th century and belonged to Artemy Volynsky, a major statesman Peter the Great's era. The Volynsky house occupied No. 21 and a small hotel, the \\"Volkovskie Nomera\\", occupied No. 23. The present structure was purpose-built as a retail store for the officers of the garrison guard. At the time, officers were paid a high salary and were expected to live a lavish lifestyle. Along these lines, the officers' cooperative felt it appropriate that their store should be no less luxurious than the most fashionable Parisian department stores. An architectural competition was held, presided over by famed Austrian architect Otto Wagner, and the German firm Wayss & Freytag was selected to lead the construction. The first phase of the store opened in 1908 as the Dom Gvardeyskava ekonomicheskava obshchestva (Дом Гвардейскаго экономическаго общества), i.e. the \\"House of the (Garrison) Guard Economic Society\\", but acquired the nickname Gvardeyskaya Ekonomka (Гвардейская экономка), or \\"Guards' Discount Shop\\" due to the discounted prices. In 1912-1913 the second phase was opened.\\"Дом ленинградской торговли\\", Квартальный надзиратель (Собака), December 2006 In 1918 after the revolution, the store was reorganized into offices and the \\"First State Department Store\\" (Первый государственный универсальный магазин) .

In 2005 the state auctioned off rights to the building to the Mercury company, the leader of the Russian retail market for the sale of luxury goods. From 2005-2012 it underwent renovations in order to open as a branch of TsUm. The retail area was expanded from 9,000 to 18,000 m2 by adding two more floors.4 http://www.spbgid.ru/index.php?news=198463 == References  External links == * Category:Department stores of Russia Category:Buildings and structures in Saint Petersburg Category:Art Nouveau architecture in Saint Petersburg Category:Art Nouveau retail buildings Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1913 Category:1913 establishments in the Russian Empire Category:Department stores of the Soviet Union Category:Companies nationalised by the Soviet Union ","title":"DLT (department store)"},{"id":"35891099","text":"Amberley is a settlement in the civil parish of Marden in Herefordshire, England.

In Transparency International's annual surveys, Italy has consistently been regarded as one of the most corrupt countries in the Eurozone. Transparency International's 2019 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country in 51st place out of 180 countries, scoring on a par with Malta, Saudi Arabia, and Grenada. Political corruption remains a major problem particularly in Lombardy, Campania and Sicily where corruption perception is at a high level. Political parties are ranked the most corrupt institution in Italy, closely followed by public officials and Parliament, according to Transparency International's. But in the 2013 Global Corruption Barometer report, Italy is in 17° position in front of the United Kingdom (18°), Switzerland (21°) and the United States (22°). Regarding business and corruption, foreign investments and economic growth are hindered by organized crime and corruption. Business executives from World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report 2013–2014 consider corruption one of the problems for doing business in Italy. Procurement process, mainly in water, roads and railway projects, in Italy is affected by corruption. According to Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer 2013, 89% of surveyed households consider political parties to be corrupt or extremely corrupt—ranking as the most corrupt institution in Italy. Furthermore, 64% of the surveyed households believe that the level of corruption has increased and 61% of surveyed households find government efforts in the fight against corruption to be ineffective Italian culture has been described as being characterized by “an ambiguous attitude to graft.” A 2015 Al Jazeera report noted that clientelism and graft have long been cornerstones of the country's political establishment, and a Forbes contributor wrote in 2016 about “the deep-seated nature of unsavoury elements in both private and public sectors” in Italy. “Many Italians,” maintained a 2010 report, have accepted corruption and poor governance as part of their lives. However, a 2015 report challenged this generally accepted view, arguing that “corruption in Italy does not seem to be a cultural issue” and that Italians consistently believe corrupt practices are less acceptable than other European nations. The Mafia plays a key role in both public and private corruption. Arising “out of business deals,” as Forbes put it, the Mafia historically “acted as a guarantor for contracts, when the judiciary was viewed as weak. Until relatively recent history, almost every deal in the country was enforced by a ‘man of honor.’” One source has described the web of corruption involving politics, business, and the Mafia as “an unholy triangle,” adding that it could alternatively be seen as a rectangle, with the Roman Catholic Church being a fourth major participant in the web of corruption, owing to links between the Mafia and Vatican Bank and to “complex money laundering systems” involving banks that manage church funds. ==Recent historyL'Aquila earthquake=== After a 1968 earthquake in Sicily, most of the funds appropriated to replace housing went to “needless construction projects,” a fact that underscored the scale of Italian corruption and the influence of the Mafia. Similarly, the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake, in which over 300 people died, was described as a “stark reminder to Italians of the risks they take by tolerating a corrupt political system.” Franco Barberi, head of an Italian committee assessing earthquake risks, alleged that anywhere where corruption had not undermined safety measures, a similar earthquake would have resulted in no fatalities. ===Tangentopoli=== A 1992–94 corruption scandal called Tangentopoli (Bribe City), uncovered by the so-called Mani pulite (Clean Hands) investigation, “rocked Italy to its core” and brought down the First Republic. But the probes “fizzled out” and the bribery just got worse. The political impact of Mani Pulite remains the worst scandal of all modern Italy. The public outrage over the corruption led to “the sudden extinction\\" of five different political factions that had controlled Italy's government since 1946. A new political establishment took their place, but corruption resumed. One target of the 1992 through 1994 corruption probes was Gianstefano Frigerio, then a Christian Democrat MP. During 1992–94, he was the defendant in four trials; one case fell afoul of the statute of limitations, but in the remaining three cases he was found guilty. He managed to have his six-year prison sentence reduced, then turned into a community service sentence, wherein his public service in the Parliament had been deemed acceptable community service. He was then re- elected to parliament in 2001, and arrested again in 2014 for participation in the massive corruption scheme surrounding the Expo in Milan. It is widely believed that two judges, Paolo Borsellino and Giovanni Falcone, were murdered in 1992 because of their efforts to punish corrupt ties between Mafia and politicians. ==Perceptions== In 2012, 65% of Italians told Transparency International (TI) that they thought corruption had intensified during the previous three years. In April 2016, Italian Supreme Court judge Piercamillo Davigo, who had prosecuted widespread political corruption in the 1990s, also expressed the view that corruption had grown worse since then. “The politicians haven’t stopped stealing, they’ve stopped being ashamed of it,” he said. “Now they blatantly claim a right to do what they used to do secretly.” Nicola Gratteri, an anti-mafia prosecutor, shared Davigo's view that the level of political corruption had heightened. Gratteri noted that twenty years prior, it was common practice for mob bosses to ask politicians for favors, but in recent years the politicians have sought the aid of mob bosses in return for public contracts. A 2013 report in The Guardian identified “Organised crime and corruption” as one of six problems currently facing Italy. The Mafia, once confined largely to the south, now operated nationwide, and had spread beyond drug trafficking and prostitution to transport, public health, and other industries.' Since 2000, Italy has experienced perceived corruption levels on par with Post-Soviet, Eastern European transition nations. ==Government== Italian public officials routinely have close ties to organized crime and to businesses. Italian citizens consider political parties and parliament itself to be the nation's two most corrupt institutions. Corruption is common in Italy's public services sector. Doing business in Italy is complicated by inefficient government bureaucracies and burdensome rules, and almost half of Italians believe that the issuance of business permits involves bribes and abuse of power. Because of corruption, it takes almost six years to complete a major public-works project in Italy, and such projects cost four times as much as elsewhere in Europe. On 3 May 1999, the Italian Parliament passed a bill that for the first time gave to the public administrations the faculty of recruiting their human resources by a competitive examination (in Italian: concorso per soli titoli) exclusively based on the previous background of the candidates in terms of academic titles and working CVs, without the provision of any written nor oral test. In 2002, Berlusconi’s government “virtually abolished the crime of false accounting,” a move that caused a growth in corruption and Mafia crime. As of 2012, Filippo Penati, a PD politician, was being investigated for corruption, specifically bribery. So was PdL party member Marco Milanese, whose fellow party members in parliament managed to prevent his arrest. Industry Minister Federica Guidi resigned in March 2016 when evidence emerged that she sought to help her boyfriend's business by helping to pass a certain budget amendment. Her boyfriend, Gianluca Gemelli, faced charges of corruption and influence peddling in the so-called Basilicata case. ===Silvio Berlusconi=== Silvio Berlusconi Silvio Berlusconi, billionaire, media mogul, and prime minister of Italy for three periods (1994-5, 2001–6, and 2008–11), was frequently accused of corruption. His firms have been charged with such crimes as bribery and false invoicing, and Berlusconi himself has widely been rumored to have Mafia ties. In 2011, the U.S. State Department named Berlusconi as participating in the “commercial sexual exploitation of a Moroccan child.” Convicted of tax fraud in 2012, he was removed from the Italian Senate after the Supreme Court confirmed the verdict the next year, but not imprisoned. In June 2013 he was found guilty of paying a teenage girl for sex, and of abusing his political power, but the verdict was overturned in 2014. ===Public procurement=== The government procurement system is characterized by a high level of corruption. This is particularly true where infrastructure contracts are concerned. In such cases, the Mafia is very likely to be involved and favoritism will almost inevitably play a part in the awarding of contracts. In recent years, most of the high-profile corruption cases in Italy have involved government procurement. In 2015, one in three public contracts involved irregularities. Contracts for Expo 2015, a fair in Milan, became the subject of a major anti- corruption investigation in which seven officials were arrested as of April 2015. Venice's mayor and over 30 other public officials were arrested in 2015 for accepting bribes in exchange for building contracts. In the same year, several businessmen were taken into custody on charges of belonging to “a gang involved in kickbacks and dodgy contracts” for high-speed rail lines, Expo 2015, a flood barrier in Venice, and other large-scale projects. Among those who had received kickbacks was Infrastructure and Transport Minister Maurizio Lupi, who was forced to resign. ===Judiciary=== The Italian courts are slow and inefficient. Almost half of citizens surveyed view the system as corrupt, and many think that bribes and abuse of power are common. ===Police=== Experts view the Italian police as being relatively free of corruption and respectful of the law. About a third of Italians, however, consider the police to be corrupt. ===Land administration=== There is a degree of corruption in Italian land administration. Over half of citizens think that officials issuing building permits commit bribery and abuse of power. ===Tax system=== The tax system lacks transparency and involves considerable bribery. Most firms view the tax rates as problematic. ===Customs service=== There is a degree of corruption in the customs system. ==Financial sector== The Bancopoli scandal of 2005–6 involved stock manipulation and insider trading. Antonio Fazio, head of Italy's central bank, gave unfair advantage to Banca Popolare Italiana (BPI) in its struggle against the Dutch bank ABN AMRO for control of Banca Antonveneta. Fazio and other figures in the banking community were ultimately forced to resign, while the managing director of BPI was arrested and the bank's entire board of directors came under investigation. ==Sports== In 2006, police investigators revealed that the managers of major Italian soccer teams had been colluding with friendly referees to rig games. ==Rome== The Senate Palace in Rome Beginning in December 2014, ties between Roman politicians and the Mafia were made public by the municipal judiciary, which provided evidence of the widespread siphoning of public funds from projects involving “the managing of green areas, recycling, social housing and refugee reception centers.” Leading officials were shown to have received bribes in exchange for government contracts; former mayor Gianni Alemanno was among those investigated. In what has come to be called the Mafia Capitale investigation, officials were accused of rigging contracts for the management of migrant centers in Rome. The scheme involved stealing millions of euros from the civic coffers. The city has continued to suffer because of this crime. In mid 2015, several leading government and business figures were arrested in connection with the scandal. A June 2016 report in The Guardian noted that Rome mayoral candidate Virginia Raggi of the Five Star Movement (M5S) was doing well in polls because of her focus on “the corruption and cronyism of Italy’s mainstream parties.” In Rome, noted the newspaper, “establishment politicians and officials” were currently “on trial alongside alleged mobsters, charged with conspiring to pocket millions of euros from rigged public contracts.” Raggi has accused the political elite of creating “a pit of waste” and of “robb[ing] Rome” with their corruption. “The level of corruption we are witnessing in Rome,” wrote one observer in 2015, “suggests that Italy needs a major change in mentality, a cultural revolution.” ==Positive view of Italian corruption== In 2001, British author and physician Theodore Dalrymple argued that corruption is actually the “one saving grace” of Italian public administration. Dalrymple explained his view that Italy's government was overburdened with an inefficient bureaucracy that slows down any progress but that corruption and bribery to bypass roadblocks allows for some progress to be made. Dalrymple further maintained that the open display of corruption on the part of government officials causes Italian citizens to view the government as the 'enemy', an attitude that Dalrymple considered sensible and healthy, as compared with the misguided British belief that the state is purely good. This belief, Dalrymple charged, “has completely eroded the proud and sturdy independence of the British population.” ==Anti-corruption efforts== In a May 2015 article for Open Democracy, Andrea Capussela and Vito Intini noted that Italy's anti-corruption efforts are inadequate and are not pursued with any enthusiasm. Since 1994, they explained, Italy has seen a series of laws passed that weakened the government's ability to combat corruption. For example, the statute of limitations was cut in half, procedural rules were made more complicated, and some corruption-related acts were decriminalized. A new anti-corruption law passed in 2012 did not reverse these laws, and is widely considered weak. Capussela and Intini asked explicitly: “why were such laws adopted and never reversed and how could the political élite get away with it?” This state of affairs was especially puzzling, they pointed out, since the struggle against corruption had often been high on the agenda of any rising politician for two decades. The Italian Anti-Corruption Law of 2012 expanded the definition of corruption and enhanced transparency and disclosure requirements for public-sector workers. It also introduced “white lists” of suppliers, service providers, and construction firms that comply with anti-Mafia laws. In addition, it established the National Anti-Corruption Authority, which has the power to investigate corruption cases, and the National Anti-Corruption Plan. The law banned persons convicted of corruption from running for public office, increased prison sentences for officials convicted of abuse of office or demanding bribes, increased penalties for private-sector corruption, and called for the institution of local anti-corruption plans and for greater transparency in hiring and budgets. The law criminalized influence-trading in both the public and private sectors, protected whistleblowers, and prohibited corrupt officials from holding certain administrative positions. But proper enforcement of the law continues to be complicated by a slow, overburdened judiciary. There are effective means of investigating police abuse and corruption, but the process is hampered by slow courts. The Code of Conduct of Public Officials includes detailed prescriptions involving transparency, conflicts of interest, and gifts. There are also Rules on Protocol Gifts that forbid gifts to public officials, who are required to report their assets. Italy is a signatory to the Council of Europe’s Civil and Criminal Law Conventions against Corruption, the UNCAC, and the OECD's Anti-Bribery Convention. Mario Monti, prime minister from 2011 to 2013, sponsored a 2012 anti-corruption law that was described by TI as an insufficient “first step.” In 2012, 64% of Italians described government anti-corruption efforts as ineffective. Only 19 percent think such efforts are effective. The Italian National Anti-Corruption Authority (ANAC) is an independent regulatory body set up in 2009. It is empowered to inspect offices and confiscate documents. In 2016, the ANAC and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) announced a partnership to fight corruption throughout the EU. == See also == * Police corruption in Italy * Crime in Italy * International Anti-Corruption Academy * Group of States Against Corruption * International Anti-Corruption Day * ISO 37001 Anti-bribery management systems * United Nations Convention against Corruption * OECD Anti-Bribery Convention * Transparency International ==References *Italy Corruption Profile from the Business Anti-Corruption Portal Italy Category:Crime in Italy by type Category:Politics of Italy Category:Italian society Category:Economy of Italy Category:Italian law Category:Government of Italy ","title":"Corruption in Italy"},{"id":"35891134","text":"The World Wrestling Peace Festival was a professional wrestling supercard event produced by Japanese professional wrestler Antonio Inoki, which took place on June 1, 1996 at the Los Angeles Sports Arena in Los Angeles, California. The event was organized by Inoki to promote world peace with an interpromotional event involving major promotions from around the world. Forty wrestlers from six countries ended up taking part in the event. Inoki's home promotion New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), as well as smaller independent groups, represented Japan, while World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) took part on behalf of the United States. The World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) were the only major promotions in North America not to participate in the show although this was not unexpected given their tense relationships with WCW during the Monday Night Wars. Both of Mexico's top promotions Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) and Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) participated in the event, which was considered unlikely by many in the industry given their own heated rivalry.Rosenbaum, Dave. \\"Multi-Promotional Supercard! World Wrestling Peace Festival Unites The World!.\\" Pro Wrestling Illustrated. Fort Washington, Pennsylvania: London Publishing Company. (November 1996): pg. 26–29. The main attraction on the event card was a tag team match with Antonio Inoki and NWA World Heavyweight Champion Dan Severn wrestling Yoshiaki Fujiwara and Oleg Taktarov. Inoki and Severn won the match when Severn pinned Fujiwara with a keylock. One of the featured bouts on the undercard was a title match between WCW World Heavyweight Champion The Giant and Sting, which The Giant won. Other matches included a \\"NJPW vs. Michinoku Pro\\" match between Jyushin Thunder Liger and The Great Sasuke, a triangle match between AAA Americas Heavyweight Champion Konnan, Chris Jericho and Bam Bam Bigelow, and a tag team match pitting Perro Aguayo and La Parka against Pierroth Jr. and Cibernetico. The event had an attendance of 5,964, far less than the 17,000 promoters were expecting, which was attributed to a poor choice of venue and lack of advertising. Though not as financially successful as Inoki's Collision in Korea show the previous year, he was widely praised for his efforts. This was the first-ever wrestling show that Inoki promoted in the United States. The event, which also helped raise money for wrestling and judo programs in Los Angeles-area high schools, was supported by then Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich. A few days before the show, Inoki was made honorary chief of police of Little Tokyo. At the show's conclusion, Inoki was also awarded a special \\"PWI Lifetime Achievement Award\\" by Pro Wrestling Illustrated senior editor Bill Apter. In addition, it received positive reviews from publications such as Pro Wrestling Illustrated and the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. This was supported by the internet wrestling community when it was released on DVD, albeit without matches featuring WCW wrestlers, years later. Arnold Furious of the professional wrestling section of 411mania.com rated the event a 7.0 out of 10. In his review, Kevin Wilson of PuroresuCentral.com called Inoki's Peace Festival \\"probably the biggest show to ever take place in America\\" featuring international talent and that \\"the majority of the matches were good and a few were near excellent\\". The show is credited, along with AAA's When Worlds Collide show two years earlier, with helping introduce lucha libre to mainstream American wrestling fans.

Indulf is first mentioned, by the historian Procopius, as a barbarian (in all probability a Goth) bodyguard of the Byzantine general Belisarius. When Belisarius departed Italy in early 549, Indulf remained behind, and soon after joined the Goths.. In late spring/early summer of 549, the Ostrogoth king Totila (r. 541–552) entrusted him with a large army and a fleet, and sent him to campaign in Dalmatia, which the Byzantines had taken in 535/536. There, he used his known association with Belisarius to capture the fortified towns of Movicurum and Laureate, whose inhabitants had not learned of his volte-face. Indulf killed the inhabitants and plundered the two settlements and the surrounding countryside. He also defeated a Byzantine force sent against him by the local Byzantine governor and captured a number of supply ships destined for the Byzantine army in Italy, before returning with his men to Italy.. Indulf reappears in 551, when he was one of the three Gothic generals entrusted with besieging and capturing Ancona. When a Byzantine relief force sailed against them, Indulf and his fellow-general Gibal headed the fleet that confronted them. The resulting Battle of Sena Gallica was a disaster for the inexperienced Goths; Gibal fell and most of the ships were sunk or captured, but Indulf was able to escape with 11 vessels. Upon reaching land, the Goths burned their ships, and quickly abandoned the siege of Ancona, taking refuge in Auximum.. Indulf makes a last appearance in Procopius's narrative after the Gothic defeat at the Battle of Mons Lactarius, where he was one of the leaders of the remnants of the Gothic army that refused to surrender and instead marched north to Ticinum. ==ReferencesSources== * * Category:6th-century deaths Category:6th- century Ostrogothic people Category:6th-century Byzantine people Category:Byzantine defectors Category:Gothic warriors Category:History of Dalmatia Category:People of the Gothic War (535–554) Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Indulf (6th century)"},{"id":"35891185","text":"Etam is an unincorporated community in Preston County, West Virginia.

He was a native of Baltimore, Maryland and served as that city's mayor for six terms between 1808 and 1824. A staunch member of Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party, he led Baltimore during the War of 1812 and was instrumental in organizing the civilian defense of the city. For several years he was the owner of one of Baltimore's largest breweries and also served as a director of the Bank of Baltimore. ==Biography== Johnson was born in Baltimore in 1767, the son of a prominent physician in that city. Little is known about his early life, and many 19th and early 20th century biographies have mistakenly referred to him as a doctor, confusing him with his father who was also named Edward Johnson.Stump, William (November 23, 1952) \\"Man In The Street: Edward Johnson\\", p. M18. Baltimore Sun. Retrieved 21 May 2012 . In 1797, he was elected to the City Council, a requirement for which was ownership of property assessed at a minimum of $2000, a very large sum in those days.According to Stump (November 23, 1952), only 200 people (about 10% of the total population of the city at the time) could fulfill the requirement. His occupation in 1798 was listed as \\"brewer\\".See Stump (November 23, 1952) and Maryland Historical Society (1971). Maryland Historical Magazine, Volume 66, pp. 66-67 Johnson's sister Rebecca had married brewery owner Thomas Peters in 1783. Johnson's father later became a partner in his son-in-law's business.

Fiercely anti-British and a member of Thomas Jefferson's Democratic-Republican party, Johnson was elected Baltimore's third mayor in 1808. A triumphal victory parade took place to celebrate his election with Johnson on board a horse-drawn boat on wheels. A bonfire was lit on Gallows Hill, and \\"to give its flame a brighter glow\\", six large casks of imported gin from Holland (on which England had exacted tax) were thrown onto it.Shepherd, Henry E.

(At the time, the mayor's term of office was only two years.) He remained in the brewery business during his first two terms as mayor. However, the brewery burnt down in 1812 and after he had it rebuilt in 1813 he sold it to George Brown. A month later, Mary Pickersgill assembled the famous Star Spangled Banner Flag on the brewery's floor.Kasper, Rob (July 3, 2011). \\"Flags and beer: A Baltimore tradition\\". Baltimore Sun. Retrieved 21 May 2012. Johnson's third term as mayor coincided with the War of 1812. Shortly after the outbreak of the war and despite his strong anti-British sentiments and anti-Federalist political views, he was nearly killed unsuccessfully trying to stop a mob who had stormed the Baltimore City Jail intent on lynching Alexander Hanson, the publisher of an extreme Federalist newspaper, and his allies who included Henry \\"Light-Horse Harry\\" Lee.David Heidler, Stephen and Heidler, Jeanne T. (2004). Encyclopedia of the War Of 1812, pp. 227-228. Naval Institute Press. During the Battle of Baltimore Johnson headed the Committee of Vigilance and Safety and, over the head of General William Winder, had General Samuel Smith put in command of the city's defense. When Johnson left office in 1816 after his fourth consecutive term as mayor, his portrait was painted by Rembrandt Peale, beginning the City of Baltimore's custom of paying for a portrait of each outgoing mayor, a custom which continues to this day. He was later appointed mayor in 1819 to finish out the term of George Stiles who had resigned from office and died shortly thereafter. It was during this period that Johnson guided the city through a serious epidemic of yellow fever and commissioned a report on the possible causes of the outbreak from the physicians who had attended the victims. When the City Council refused to pay for the publication of the report, he contributed $150 of his own money towards the cost of printing.See Baltimore City Archives. Mayor's Office.

A former member of the country's governing People's Action Party (PAP), he was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) in three elections. Choo resigned from his MP position and PAP membership before being convicted for cheating. He was charged in 2011 with three counts of corruption and one of criminal breach of trust during his tenure at the Singapore Table Tennis Association (of which he served as President from 1991–98 and from 2002–08). ==Career== Choo first became a Member of Parliament (MP) after the 1988 general elections where his party, PAP, contested and won the election in Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency (GRC) against the Singapore Justice Party. In the 1991 general elections, Choo moved to Jalan Besar GRC and was re-elected via a walkover. In March 1992, Choo caused controversy when he remarked in Parliament about driving through Little India and finding the neighbourhood in \\"complete darkness\\" \\"not because there was no light, but because there were too many Indians around there\\". This led to calls for his resignation. Choo later apologised, calling his remarks a \\"joke\\". In the 1997 general elections, Choo contested in Jalan Besar GRC again and his team won the elections against the team from Singapore Democratic Party. In December 1999, Choo resigned from his MP position and PAP membership before pleading guilty to cheating charges in court. With Choo's resignation, Acting Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the other Jalan Besar GRC MPs will continue to serve the constituents. Choo was the deputy president of the Singapore Table Tennis Association (STTA) from 1989 to 1991 and was elected as the president in 1991 before resigning in 1998. After a four-year break, he became president of the association again in 1998. He succeeded Yeo Guat Kwang as STTA's president in 2002 after being elected unopposed at STTA's biennial general meeting at the Singapore Table Tennis Academy. Choo stepped down as president during STTA's biennial general meeting in 2008. After leaving STTA in 2008, Choo became the general manager of Marina Bay Golf Course. Choo was also Asia’s representative in the International Table Tennis Federation Development and Continental Council from 2004 and the Honorary Treasurer of the Asian Table Tennis Union from 1991. In 2009, Choo received the IOC President's Trophy from the Singapore National Olympic Committee for outstanding contributions to the development of table tennis in Singapore since 1989. ==Legal troublesCheating conviction=== In November 1990, Choo issued a false invoice from his company claiming to have sold equipment worth more than a million dollars to Wong See Kee, Choo's brother-in-law. Wong had used the invoice to get S$830,000 in financing, supposedly to pay for the purchase of the equipment. In 1999, Choo was charged with cheating. He resigned from his MP position and PAP before pleading guilty in court to a charge which was reduced from aggravated to simple cheating. Under Singapore law, an MP loses his seat if he gets a year's jail or more than S$2,000 fine. Choo's former fellow MP and Senior Counsel, K Shanmugam, represented Choo. Shanmugam pushed for a fine instead of a jail sentence. Petition letters by grassroots leaders, vouching for Mr Choo's character, described Choo as \\"hardworking,\\" \\"compassionate,\\" \\"selfless\\" and dedicated to community service. Lee Hsien Loong, the then Acting Prime Minister, said that Choo has done the right thing in resigning as an MP and PAP member, before pleading guilty in court. Choo was sentenced to two weeks' jail and fined S$10,000. ===Corruption charges=== From 2005 to 2007, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) received several anonymous complaints against Choo alleging that he had charged his personal airfares, expenses, phone bills to STTA and received gifts from Chinese coaches and players. The total amount involved about S$10,600. The offences were allegedly committed during Choo's tenure as the president of the STTA. The CPIB conducted investigations revealed that in 2005, Choo had received S$1,500 from Liu Zhongze, who was then a national team player, and Luo Jie, who was then an assistant coach of the STTA, in return for giving Liu more opportunities to represent the STTA in table tennis tournaments. Between 2003 and 2004, Choo is believed to have accepted USD$600 on two separate occasions from Shi Mei Sheng, who was then a STTA coach for approval of usage of two different training facilities in China. On 8 December 2011, Choo was charged with three counts of corruption and one of criminal breach of trust. Koh Li Ping, former High Performance Manager of STTA, was also involved in the criminal breach of trust charge. The CPIB said that between 2002 and 2003, Luo Jie, whose work pass only permitted him to work for STTA, provided table tennis training to students of Fuhua Secondary School. But the school was unable to pay him for the training provided, which amounted to S$8,400. Luo Jie told Choo and Koh about this, both of them then allegedly arranged with the school principal to engage STTA in a new training arrangement. The proceeds for the new training arrangement received will be used to pay Luo Jie for the outstanding fees. After STTA received the payment from the school, Koh obtained approval from Choo to authorise a payment of S$8,400 to Luo Jie, even though the latter did not provide any training services under the new training arrangement. Choo's case has been adjourned to December 22. If found guilty of corruption, he can be fined S$100,000 and jailed five years for each charge. The punishment for criminal breach of trust is a jail term of up to 15 years and a fine. Choo was acquitted of his charge of criminal breach of trust after the prosecution dropped the three other counts of corruption and proceeded with the criminal breach of trust charge. ==Personal life== Choo has a nephew, Desmond Choo, who is also a politician for the PAP. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Members of the Parliament of Singapore Category:Singaporean people of Teochew descent Category:People's Action Party politicians Category:Prisoners and detainees of Singapore Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Choo Wee Khiang"},{"id":"35891332","text":"Heero ibrahim Abdulai (born September 5, 1988) is an American football defensive tackle who attended college at Arkansas-Pine Bluff.

She was 14 weeks pregnant when her husband found her unconscious in November, possibly from a blood clot. Munoz subsequently died from brain death. Prior to her death, Munoz had indicated that she would not like to be kept artificially alive if brain dead. The fetus had suffered from oxygen deprivation and was suspected to be non-viable; the fetus's lower extremities were deformed to the extent that the gender couldn't be determined, had fluid building up inside the skull (hydrocephalus); and possibly had a heart problem. An attorney who had helped rewrite the Texas state law being used to keep her body on life support at John Peter Smith Hospital said that there was a problem with the application of the law to a patient that was no longer alive. Her husband Eric, with the support of her family, successfully sued the hospital for withdrawing treatment. Numerous states have adopted laws restricting the ability of doctors to end artificial life support for terminally ill pregnant patients with 12 of those states (including Texas) with the most restrictive such laws, which automatically invalidate a woman’s advance directive if she is pregnant stating that, regardless of the progression of the pregnancy, a woman must remain on life sustaining treatment until she gives birth with no exception for patients who will be in prolonged severe pain or who will be physically harmed by continuing life sustaining treatment. Pojman, who was also involved in the drafting of the law, said the hospital is correctly abiding by the law's goal of protecting the rights of an unborn child. ==References * Official Website * All eyes on House floor as special session nears end KVUE News June 27, 2011 * Anti-Abortion Group Photographing Empty House Seats Texas Tribune June 27, 2011 Category:Anti-abortion organizations in the United States Category:Political organizations based in the United States Category:Non-profit organizations based in Texas ","title":"Texas Alliance for Life"},{"id":"35891363","text":"The ClementJames Centre is an award-winning UK education charity based in North Kensington, one of London's most disadvantaged areas.

Her inspiration is at times melancholic, poetic and refractory in the face of an increasingly dehumanized world. In 1973 her protest song En plein cœur, in which her lyrics are set to music by Jean-Pierre Pouret, achieved success and notoriety. The following year brought her another hit with the prescient and sad portrait of a child cooped up in the city: L’Enfant du 92e, for which she co-wrote the lyrics with Lowery, set to the music of Belgian singer-interpreter Pierre Rapsat. Jeanne-Marie Sens gives the impression of preferring to live in a world of imagination and fantasy, more beautiful than reality, and the many records she aimed at a child audience tend to confirm this. A song from an album of children's songs, Chansons pour de vrai, Volume 2 (1977) brought her the greatest popular success: Tant et tant de temps (So many times), with music composed by Jean-Pierre Castelain. From then on she worked almost exclusively with this composer. Despite their successful and talented association, however, her popularity began to decline. In 1981, she signed a plea for acceptance of homosexuality, Il a la tête d’un poète, and incorporated the petition created that year by Jean-Pierre Castelain for the coming presidential elections, Je donnerai ma voix with a text by Maxime Piolot. After that she ceased making albums. Her last two 45s have the last beautiful works of the Sens-Castelain partnership: Au jardin un dimanche (1983), and Jalousie and Donne-moi ton sourire (1984). In the early 1990s she and Hubert Tonka co-founded the Sens & Tonka publishing house. ==Partial discography== ;45 Recordings *Éditions Gamma référence: CED 22011, 1972. \\"Les Clowns\\" Lyrics and music: Giani Esposito \\"L'Hautil\\" Lyrics: J.P.

It was the culmination of the 2005 Women's Cricket World Cup, the eighth tournament of the series. Australia won by 98 runs, clinching their fifth World Cup title, and their fourth on foreign soil. It was the first time that the Indian team had reached at Final of a women's World Cup. Australia won the toss, and their captain Belinda Clark opted to bat first. Her side scored 215 runs with the loss of 4 wickets (215/4) in their 50 overs. Their top scorer was Australian vice-captain Karen Rolton, who scored 107 runs batting at number three. Indian bowler Amita Sharma took two wickets for 39 runs (2/39). In their response, India failed to build a good opening partnership, as opener Jaya Sharma was dismissed for only 5 runs. India continued to score poorly, and the last of their ten wickets fell at the end of their 46th over. Australia bowlers Shelley Nitschke and Cathryn Fitzpatrick each took two wickets. Rolton was named player of the match. ==Route to the finalGroup stage=== Australia's Karen Rolton was named the player of the tournament. The 2005 Women's World Cup was a round-robin tournament, in which each of the eight teams played all seven others and the top four progressed to the semifinals. All of Australia' group stage matches were scheduled at Tshwane University of Technology Oval, Pretoria, except the one against West Indies. Their first match was against England, which \\"washed out after heavy rain lashed Pretoria\\". Then, Australia has five consecutive victories, against New Zealand, West Indies, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Ireland by 32 runs, 79 runs, 97 runs, eight wickets and ten wickets respectively. India's Jhulan Goswami took the third highest number of wickets in the tournament, behind her teammates Neetu David and Amita Sharma. India' group stage matches were also scheduled at Pretoria, except the one against New Zealand. Their first match was against ri Lanka, which ended with no result. It won its next three matches, against Ireland, South Africa and England by nine wickets, four wicket and seven wickets respectively. It then faced it first loss in the tournament, facing a 16-runs loss from New Zealand. Both the finalists faced each other in the last match of their group stage, but it was abandoned without a ball being bowled. ===Semifinals=== Australia played England in the first semifinal of the tournament. Australia won the toss and put England to bat. England finished on 158, with Fitzpatrick taking three wicket for 27 runs. Clark's tally of 62 runs and Sthalekar's 29 runs helped Australia to reach the required 159 in 47 overs to progress to the final. Clarke was named player of the match. In the second semifinal India played New Zealand, which won the toss and elected to field first. The Indian openers were quickly dismissed, but Chopra scored 44 and Raj 91 not out, helping India to reach a total of 204 runs. New Zealand finished on 164, and Amita Sharma finished with three wicket for 24 runs. India won by 40 runs and progressed to the final, with Raj being the player of the match. ==Buildup== Before the tournament, Jenny Thompson of ESPNcricinfo identified Australia, India, England and New Zealand as the most likely winners. Australia were runners-up in the previous tournament in 2000. This was the first time that India had reached the final of a women's World Cup, but the seventh for Australia, and their sixth on foreign soil. Australia was the only team still unbeaten in the tournament. The one change in the Australian team was the inclusion of Clea Smith in place of Emma Liddell. India fielded the same side as in their semifinal win over New Zealand. ==MatchSummary=== Batting conditions were good, and Australia's captain Belinda Clark chose to bat first after winning the toss. The Indian bowlers started well: Clark was caught at wicket by wicket keeper Anju Jain, and in the 11th over, Keightley was caught at second slip by Dhar at second slip. Rolton batted at number three and Jones at number four, taking Australia to 50 runs in the 19th over during their 40-run third-wicket partnership. Jones was dismissed in the 25th over by David and Sthalekar came in, scoring 55 in a 139-run fourth-wicket stand with Rolton, during which Australia reached 100 runs in the 34th over. Sthalekar was caught and bowled by Dhar in the last over, after which Blackwell made 4 runs in 2 balls, giving Australia a total of 215 runs. Rolton remained not out, making 107 runs after she was dropped by Amita Sharma on 60. Goswami, Amita Sharma, Dhar and David each took one wicket for India. India played a poor innings, losing their first wicket in the 8th over, as Jaya Sharma got run out by Sthalekar and Price. Jain, who made 29 runs, got caught by Sthalekar with an easy catch at mid-wicket. Chopra run out by Julie Hayes on ten runs. Then skipper Raj got leg before wicket by Nitschke, playing across the line. Dhar and Kala were run out in consecutive overs, at 6 and 3 runs respectively. Later Amita Sharma and Goswami made 22 and 18 runs respectively. Amita Sharma got leg before wicket by Sthalekar, and Goswami was caught by substitute Kate Blackwell on backward point. David and Khadeer made ducks. Only four Indian players scored double figures, and the team wa all out for 117 runs in 46 overs. Australia's most successful bowler was Nitschke, who took two wickets for 14 runs. Rolton was named player of the match and player of the series. ===Scorecard=== { style=\\"background:transparent;\\" style=\\"width:8em;\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  On-field umpires  Shaun George (South Africa) Zed Ndamane (South Africa) -  Third umpire  Walter Liebisch (South Africa) -  Match referee  Cyril Mitchley () -  Toss  elected to bat first -  Result  Australia won by 98 runs -  Tournament impact  Australia won the 2005 Women's Cricket World Cup } { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center; width: 60%;\\" class= + Australia batting innings - !

The computing platform is based on spiking neural networks, useful in simulating the human brain (see Human Brain Project).A million ARM cores to host brain simulator News article on the project in the EE Times A manifesto for the SpiNNaker project, surveying and reviewing the general level of understanding of brain function and approaches to building computer modelof the brain. A description of the Globally Asynchronous, Locally Synchronous (GALS) nature of SpiNNaker, with an overview of the asynchronous communications hardware designed to transmit neural 'spikes' between processors. Modelling and analysis of the SpiNNaker interconnect in a million- core machine, showing the suitability of the packet-switched network for large-scale spiking neural network simulation. A demonstration of SpiNNaker's ability to simulate different neural models (simultaneously, if necessary) in contrast to other neuromorphic hardware. Four-chip, real-time simulation of a four-million-synapse cortical circuit, showing the extreme energy efficiency of the SpiNNaker architecture The completed design is housed in 10 19-inch racks, with each rack holding over 100,000 cores.Video interview by computerphile with Steve Furber The cards holding the chips are held in 5 blade enclosures, and each core emulates 1000 Neurons. In total, the goal is to simulate the behavior of aggregates of up to a billion neurons in real time. This machine requires about 100 kW from a 240 V supply and an air- conditioned environment. SpiNNaker is being used as one component of the neuromorphic computing platform for the Human Brain Project. On 14 October 2018 the HBP announced that the million core milestone had been achieved. On 24 September 2019 HBP announced that a 8 million euro grant, that will fund construction of the second generation machine, (called spincloud) has been given to TU Dresden. ==References== Category:Cybernetics Category:Formal sciences Category:Computational neuroscience Category:Emerging technologies Category:Unsolved problems in computer science Category:Computational fields of study Category:AI accelerators Category:Computer architecture Category:Department of Computer Science, University of Manchester Category:Science and technology in Greater Manchester ","title":"SpiNNaker"},{"id":"35891425","text":"Location of Liberia This is a list of butterflies of Liberia.

It was designed by F.E. Wentworth- Shields and constructed by John Mowlem & Company and Edmund Nuttall Sons & Company. It was formally opened by HM King George V and Queen Mary on 26 July 1933 although the final construction work was only complete the following year. At the time of construction it was the largest graving dock in the world, a status it retained for nearly thirty years. ==Construction and design== The dock was built as part of the westward expansion of Southampton Docks, then owned by the Southern Railway. There had previously been several dry docks in the port, each larger than its predecessor, but a larger dock was needed to accommodate the new passenger liners which were coming into service, including RMS Queen Mary () and RMS Queen Elizabeth (). The new dock cost more than £2,000,000 to construct. The design of dry docks had evolved to mirror developments in ship design. Until the end of the 19th century most ships had curved hulls, so dry docks were built with curved or semi-circular cross- sections, with steps (known as \\"altars\\") built in to support the wooden props which held the hull of the vessel in place. By the 1930s, ships were built with near-vertical sides; this was reflected in the design of the new dock which has steep sides with a restricted number of stepped altars, at the base of the walls. High-level altars were not required as the large ships could dock on three lines of blocks without the need for shoring. The new dock was designed by F.E. Wentworth-Shields and constructed by John Mowlem & Company and Edmund Nuttall Sons & Company. The dock took two years to build and required the removal of two million tons of earth. The dock was built virtually entirely of concrete, with granite dressings for the sills and caisson stops, the flights of steps leading to the floor and the coping of the walls at the entrance. The dock is long, wide and over deep and was capable of holding of water. The floor of the dock is thick at the centre line, tapering to thick at the sides. The dock was provided with bollards at regular intervals on either side with others set into the dock walls. The caisson door, which weighed , slid sideways into a chamber at the right (east) of the entrance from the River Test. At intervals, there are vertical buttresses projecting from the sides of the dock; these prevented the bilge keels of vessels striking the base of the walls. The faces of the piers were protected to a depth of below the top with elm fenders. The adjacent pump house held four pumps which could empty the dock in just over four hours. ===Pumping station=== The pumping station, at the western side of the dock, was also probably designed by F.E. Wentworth-Shields. It is a rectangular block building, with a half-hipped roof, built of red brick with stone dressing in the \\"inter-war classical revival style suggesting a temple\\". The building has a stone cornice and a second stone band above the windows, which are separated by brick pilasters. The original west bay, which housed an office, has been demolished. Internally, the pumphouse walls are lined with cream and green tiles on the lower part. A wooden staircase leads to a mezzanine balcony with a wooden balustrade. In the main, southern part of the building, there are the four pumps which pumped water out of the dock. ==Opening== Majestic entering the dock shortly after opening. Majestic in King George V dry dock The dock was opened on 26 July 1933 when the Royal Yacht Victoria and Albert, with King George V and Queen Mary on board, broke a red, white and blue ribbon stretched across the entrance as she sailed into the incomplete dock. During the naming ceremony, Queen Mary emptied a cup of \\"Empire\\" wine into the dock. The first ship to use the dock was White Star's Majestic in 1934. ==World War II== In the spring of 1942, the dock was used for training the commandos who were to take part in the raid on the French port of St. Nazaire. The King George V dock was very similar in design and construction to the Normandie dry dock at St. Nazaire, thus enabling the commandos to familiarise themselves with the construction of the dock. The men practised descending the stairs of the pumping chamber in the dark and setting explosives against the pump mechanism; they also practised climbing inside the hollow caisson to set explosives and setting charges against the gate winding machinery. In the raid itself, the obsolete destroyer HMS Campbeltown was rammed into the Normandie dock gates and exploded, while the commandos destroyed the dock machinery. In 1944, the dock was engaged in the building of Bombardon breakwaters which were to be used as temporary floating breakwaters to protect the Mulberry harbours during the Allied invasion of Normandy. ==Decline and closure== In 2005, Associated British Ports agreed to terminate the lease on the dock to the then operators, ship repairers A&P; Group, following which the caisson gates and keel blocks were removed, thus converting the dock to a permanent wet dock. The dock was then used in conjunction with the bulk-handling terminal at Berths 107 to 109, operated by Solent Stevedores. In April 2012, there was a large fire in scrap metal stored at the dock, which resulted in a large cloud of smoke over the city for several days. A few weeks later, there was another incident at the dock when firefighters were called to attend a pile of wood chips which were releasing steam vapour. ==Listed building== In June 2006, despite the gates having been removed, the dock and the adjacent pump house were both granted Grade II listed building status. In the listing for the dock, English Heritage summarised its historical importance: > King George V Graving Dock has special historic interest both locally and > nationally as a rare survival from the heyday of the transatlantic liner > era. It has special architectural interest as a good example of the > evolution of dock design as it stood in the mid-20th century, innovative in > its construction. The dock has associations with great ships and events > important in British history, and was the most significant dry dock in one > of Britain's leading ports. Of the pump house, they said: > The inter-war classical style is impressive and temple-like, and the > interior is exceptional for its survival of fixtures and fittings. Although > there have been some alterations to the periphery of the building, its > function is amply illustrated by the surviving features and its > architectural presence offsets the largely below-ground dock. ==References *Video of opening ceremony * Video of RMS Queen Mary in the dock in 1949 Category:Drydocks Category:Port of Southampton Category:Grade II listed buildings in Hampshire Category:Buildings and structures in Southampton ","title":"King George V Graving Dock"},{"id":"35891539","text":"Pseudotomoxia palpalis is a species of beetle in the genus Pseudotomoxia of the family Mordellidae, which is part of the superfamily Tenebrionoidea.

The Byzantine relief armies failed to coordinate their efforts, and only two forces, under Theodore Choumnos and John Maurozomes, actually came to the city's aid. In the event, the Normans undermined the city's eastern wall, opening a breach through which they entered the city. The conquest degenerated quickly into a full-scale massacre of the city's inhabitants, some 7,000 corpses being found afterwards. The siege is extensively chronicled by the city's archbishop, Eustathius of Thessalonica, who was present in the city during and after the siege. == Aftermath == The Normans occupied Thessalonica until mid-November, when, following their defeat at the Battle of Demetritzes, they evacuated it. Coming on the heels of the usurper Andronikos Komnenos's massacre of the Latins in Constantinople in 1182, the massacre of the Thessalonians by the Normans deepened the rift between the Latins and the East. It also directly led to the deposition and execution of the unpopular Andronikos I Komnenos by the Latins and the rise to the throne of Isaac II Angelos. ==Sources== * * * Category:1185 in Europe Category:1180s in the Byzantine Empire Category:Conflicts in 1185 Thessalonica 1185 Thessalonica 1185 Thessalonica 1185 Thessalonica 1185 Category:Medieval Thessalonica Category:Massacres in the Byzantine Empire Category:Military history of Thessaloniki Category:12th century in the Kingdom of Sicily λεηλάτησης της Θεσσαλονίκης Category:Looting ","title":"Sack of Thessalonica (1185)"},{"id":"35891588","text":"Pseudotomoxia rufoabdominalis is a species of beetle in the genus Pseudotomoxia of the family Mordellidae, which is part of the superfamily Tenebrionoidea.

It was one of the first private schools in Russia. It was established in 1992, shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union. ==Education== Bogin promotes critical and abstract thinking, an opposite from the rote memorization promoted during the Soviet Union era. Classes are videotaped so that Bogin and the staff can discuss educational methodologies. Clifford J. Levy said that while the school in Brooklyn where his children previously attended had an \\"everyone’s-a-winner ethos\\" NHS had the message that \\"learning is hard, but you have to do it.

The school regularly rates students older than the age of 9 by test scores and publicly posts these scores on a central wall. Students at NHS recite \\"Yevgeny Onegin\\" by Alexander Pushkin. According to Bogin, the school does not often admit non-native Russian speakers, and it hardly ever admits American students. Bogin told Levy that his children would be placed in the regular classes.

Levy added that the clientele tended to be upper middle class parents who had a favorable reception to Bogin's methodology. As of around 2011 the school had about a $10,000 USD (about $ when adjusted for inflation) per child per year tuition, making it too expensive for most Moscow citizens. Levy said that, at the same time, the school was \\"not appealing to the rich, who often preferred compliant teachers and lavish facilities.\\" According to Levy, the parents of students at the school \\"drove nice cars, lived in apartments that had been privatized in the post-Soviet era and vacationed in Western Europe.\\" The parents of students in Levy's classes included architects, bankers, lawyers, publishers, professors, and a manufacturer of cosmetics.

He was born in İznik, and died there in 1469. His father Sayyid Ahmed came from Egypt and settled in İznik.

He won a Gold Glove Award in 2015. ==Amateur career== Arizona State in 2009 Calhoun attended Buckeye Union High School in Buckeye, Arizona. In 2005, Calhoun and Sammy Solis were named the West Valley High School Baseball Co-Players of the Year. Calhoun then attended and played college baseball for Yavapai College and Arizona State University. In 2010, his senior year at Arizona State, he batted .321 with 17 home runs and 59 runs batted in (RBIs) in 61 games for the Arizona State Sun Devils. ==Professional careerMinor leagues=== The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim selected Calhoun in the eighth round of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft. He was assigned to Rookie League Orem, where in 56 games, he hit .292 with 7 HR and 42 RBI. He played 2011 with High-A Inland Empire, where in 133 games, he hit .324 with 22 HR, 99 RBI and a .957 OPS. He also stole 20 bases. He was named to the California League Postseason All-Star team as a utility player. He was the Kenny Myers Minor League Player of the Year in 2011. This monster season earned him a direct promotion to Triple-A Salt Lake to begin 2012. In 43 games prior to his first callup, he hit .296 with 5 HR and 31 RBI. ===Major leagues===  Los Angeles Angels  =2012-2015= Calhoun with the Angels in 2012 On May 21, 2012, Calhoun was recalled by the Angels to replace Vernon Wells, who was placed on the disabled list. He made his debut the next day, and he recorded his first major league hit the day after, a double off of Jarrod Parker. Calhoun was the 8th player from the 2010 MLB draft to make his major-league debut. He was sent back down on June 12 after 8 games with the Angels. He made the Pacific Coast League All-Star team. He had another short stint with the Angels before being called up for good in August. His final stats with the Bees in 105 games were .298 with 14 HR, 73 RBI, and a .877 OPS. He was used exclusively off the bench in August and September. In 21 games with the Angels, he hit .174 with 1 RBI in just 23 at-bats. In 2013, Calhoun was competing for the fifth outfielder spot with J. B. Shuck, but after a poor spring training, in which he hit .174 with 10 RBI and 16 strikeouts in 23 games, Shuck won the position, and Calhoun began 2013 with Salt Lake. Calhoun was recalled on July 28 to replace the injured Albert Pujols. Calhoun was hitting .354 with 12 HR and 49 RBI with Salt Lake. On August 2, Calhoun hit his first major league home run, a two-run, go-ahead shot off of Steve Delabar in the bottom of the 8th inning, part of a 4-hit night for Calhoun. Because Pujols went down, Josh Hamilton received the most time at designated hitter, leaving right field up for grabs. By the time September rolled around, Calhoun won the job, starting the last 21 games of the season there. In 58 games with the Angels in 2013, Calhoun hit .282 with 8 HR and 32 RBI.

Because the alphabet is relatively new in human evolution, it is unlikely that this region developed as a result of selection pressures related to word recognition per se; however, this region may be highly specialized for certain types of shapes that occur naturally in the environment and are therefore likely to surface within written language. In addition to word recognition, the VWFA may participate in higher-level processing of word meaning. In 2003, functional imaging experiments have also raised doubts about whether the VWFA is an actual region. This skepticism has largely disappeared, however there seems to be much variability in its size. An area that may fall within this mental organ in one person may fall outside it in someone else Anomalies in the activation of this region have been linked to reading disorders. If the area is subjected to a surgical lesion, the patient will suffer a clear impairment to reading ability but not to recognition of objects, names, or faces or to general language abilities. There will be some improvement over the next six months, but reading will still take twice as long as it had before surgery. Electrical brain stimulation to the VWFA causes reading-specific disruptions and can cause letter misperception. == Visual word form hypotheses  Pre-lexical visual word form hypothesis === Put forward by Cohen and colleagues (2000). The basics of this theory state that the neurons in the ventral occipital-temporal cortex (vOT) – which the posterior fusiform gyrus is a part of – have receptive fields that are sensitive to bigrams, or two letter combinations that commonly occur in words. The neurons sense and process the bigrams, to detect their legality. Here the posterior left fusiform gyrus (part of the vOT), is thought to be one station in a long line of processing areas. The processing starts with visual feature detectors in extrastriate cortex, proceeding through letter detectors and letter-cluster detectors in the posterior fusiform, and then activating lexical representations stored in more anterior multimodal fusiform area. The theory states the function of the VWFA is pre-lexical as it occurs before the word is understood to have meaning. === Lexical visual word form hypothesis === Put forward by Kronbilcher et al. (2004), was based on functional imaging data that showed, in a parametric fMRI study, that a decrease in activation in the left fusiform gyrus was seen in response to an increase in the frequency of the word - where the frequency is how common the word is. This data refutes the previous pre-lexical theory as if the VWFA was pre-lexical one would expect equal activation throughout all frequencies. Instead a lexical theory was proposed where the left fusiform gyrus neurons are thought not to detect words by attempting to match them to stored representations of known words. This would explain the data as more common words would take less time to detect than the less common words, reducing the energy needed for computation and therefore potentially reducing the magnitude of the haemodynamic response that is detected by BOLD fMRI. A recent intracranial electrocorticography study shows that the activity in the VWFA goes through multiple stages of processing. Using classification with direct neural recordings from the VWFA, Hirshorn et al. showed that early VWFA activity, from approximately 100-250 milliseconds after reading a word, is consistent with a pre-lexical representation and later activity, from approximately 300-500 milliseconds is consistent with a lexical representation. These results potentially mediate between the pre-lexical and lexical hypotheses by showing that both levels of representation may be seen in the VWFA, but at different latencies after reading a word. Previous studies using fMRI did not have the temporal resolution to differentiate between these two stages. == Alternative functions for the cortical area ascribed to the VWFA == Devlin et al. (2006) state that the left posterior fusiform gyrus is not a 'word form area' as such, but instead hypothesizes that the area is dedicated to determining word meaning. That is to say, that this area of the brain is where bottom-up information (visual shapes of words (form), and other visual attributes if necessary) comes into contact with top-down information (semantics and phonology of words). Therefore, the left fusiform gyrus is thought to be the interface in the processing of the words not a dictionary that computes a word based on its form alone, as the lexical word form hypothesis states. This paper also presents evidence that refutes the lexical hypothesis. Another major difference between this hypothesis and the prior ones mentioned is that it is not limited to words alone but to any \\"meaningful stimulus\\", in fact non- sensical objects may activate the posterior fusiform cortex in order to extract their meaning from higher-level processes. However, the finding that disruption of the VWFA due to surgical lesions or electrical brain stimulation has little impact on a person's ability to extract meaning from non-word stimuli provides strong evidence that the function of the VWFA is primarily restricted to processing words and not \\"any meaningful stimulus.\\" However, there is some evidence that the VWFA is not specialized for reading specifically but instead has a set of specific properties and functions that make it useful for reading—and particularly important for fluid reading—but may also allow it to play roles in other forms of visual processing. VWFA involvement appears to depend partly on the visual complexity of a stimulus, and it appears to process recognizable visual stimuli that are grouped together. This may explain why \\"letter by letter\\" reading is still possible even when the VWFA suffers lesions that otherwise interfere with fluid reading ability. This may also address why the VWFA is activated even more strongly by line drawings and Amharic characters than by written words familiar to study participants. == Involvement in Hyperlexia and Dyslexia  Hyperlexia === Some research suggests that children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may rely more heavily on visual perception areas—including the VWFA—and less heavily on phonological areas during reading tasks compared to non-ASD children. Greater activation of the VWFA may be particularly significant in children with hyperlexia, or reading ability beyond one's training. Hyperlexia is thought to be associated with ASD, with estimates of prevalence in autistic children ranging from 6 to 20.7%. One study of a hyperlexic child with ASD showed elevated activation compared to controls of the right posterior inferior temporal sulcus, where the right VWFA (R-VWFA) is thought to be located. This region is active during early stages of reading development, while a non-ASD child of the subject's reading level would be expected to make less use of this region in favor of phonological (\\"letter-to-sound\\") processes. === Dyslexia === Meta-analysis of studies of children and adults with dyslexia suggests that underactivation of the left occipitotemporal region—particularly the VWFA—may be involved in dyslexics' difficulty with fluid reading. These reading difficulties may also be related to poor connectivity between the VWFA and associated regions in the parietal cortex responsible for visual attention. ==See also== * Fusiform gyrus * Reading ==References== Visual word form area ","title":"Visual word form area"},{"id":"35891814","text":"The Open Goldberg Variations is a non-profit project that created a high quality studio recording and typeset score of Johann Sebastian Bach's Goldberg Variations, and placed them directly into the public domain.Schaake, Jonathan.

Bach Goldberg-Variationen BWV 988\\", Musescore.com, 2012 The digital version has two major implications for the way music is being produced, used and distributed online: #It separates music notes from traditional paper, allowing people to edit, alter and share music online. This social component was a key factor for ensuring a high quality of the score, allowing people to review, improve and change the score in the course of on open peer reviewing process. #The digital version also changes the way people use and experience music, adding a visual layer to audio content. For example, it can be used in schools or universities to visualise music as it is being played, or it can be embedded into websites to extend radio programmes. On June 24, 2012, Wisconsin Public Radio broadcast the Open Goldberg Variations to their radio audience and simultaneously provided the score on their website, where the audience was able to follow the notes being played, have measures highlighted, and pages turned automatically, synchronized with the music from the radio. ==See also== *Musopen == References  * Category:Johann Sebastian Bach Category:Albums free for download by copyright owner Category:Public domain music Category:Free software Category:Kickstarter-funded albums ","title":"Open Goldberg Variations"},{"id":"35891815","text":"Location of Malawi This is a list of butterflies of Malawi.

The Zimmert set Z(d) is the set of positive integers n such that 4n2 < -D-3 and n ≠ 2; D is a quadratic non-residue of all odd primes in d; n is odd if D is not congruent to 5 modulo 8. The cardinality of Z(d) may be denoted by z(d). ==Property== For all but a finite number of d we have z(d) > 1: indeed this is true for all d > 10476. ==Application== Let Γd denote the Bianchi group PSL(2,Od), where Od is the ring of integers of. As a subgroup of PSL(2,C), there is an action of Γd on hyperbolic 3-space H3, with a fundamental domain. It is a theorem that there are only finitely many values of d for which Γd can contain an arithmetic subgroup G for which the quotient H3/G is a link complement. Zimmert sets are used to obtain results in this direction: z(d) is a lower bound for the rank of the largest free quotient of Γd and so the result above implies that almost all Bianchi groups have non- cyclic free quotients. ==References== * Category:Integer sequences Category:Hyperbolic geometry ","title":"Zimmert set"},{"id":"35892031","text":"Spellbound is a British game show that aired on Sky One from 3 October 1994 to 30 August 1996. It was hosted by Paul Coia. ==Background== Spellbound was created for Sky One as a way to involve readers of the network's Sky Magazine in an interactive game. The magazine included game cards, which viewers could use to mark off letters revealed in each round; all viewers who marked off every letter on their card for that day and called the studio by a set time won equal shares of a £1,000 cash jackpot. Viewers could also play a call-in game to qualify for a chance to answer a multiple-choice general knowledge question and win £1,000. The studio portion of the show was pre-recorded, while the viewer-involvement sections were transmitted live as inserts. ===Main game: Lucky Letters=== The contestants were shown a board of 15 numbers, ranging from 1 to 99 and arranged in three rows of five. Hidden behind some of these numbers were letters that spelled out two words in a category announced by Coia. The other numbers concealed \\"lousy letters\\" that did not belong in either word. Every letter in a word was vertically or horizontally adjacent to the one after it, and the initial \\"starter letter\\" was marked by a gold star. No individual space was used in both words, or more than once in either word alone. Each contestant chose a number from the board to start the round. If the letter behind it belonged in a word, the number was added to their score; if it was a lousy letter, they received no points for that turn. After all three contestants had had two turns (later reduced to one), Coia began to ask toss-up questions on the buzzer, and the contestant who responded correctly chose a number. Finding a starter letter immediately awarded a free turn, and completing a word awarded both a free turn and a 50-point bonus. However, if the contestant completed a word by finding its starter letter, they received only one free turn. The round ended when all the letters in both words had been uncovered. Three rounds were played, with the lowest scorer at the end of each round choosing first in the next one. The high scorer after the third round advanced to the Spellbound Challenge. ===Bonus round: Spellbound Challenge=== The five vowels (A, E, I, O, U) were displayed three times each on the board, covered with playing card symbols (diamonds, hearts, clubs, spades, jokers) and scrambled. Based on Coia's talk with the contestant about their hobbies, three words were chosen and stripped of their first two vowels. The contestant had eight chances to complete the words by uncovering the six vowels on the board. When a usable vowel was found, the contestant chose where to put it in the three words. At different times during the show's run, either cash or prizes would be at stake. When cash was offered, the contestant won £250 for completing each of the first two words, and the third replaced this money with a jackpot of at least £1,000 that was randomly set at the beginning of the episode. In the case of prizes, the first completed word awarded a prize and each successive word replaced it with one of greater value. ==Transmissions== {  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - ! Series !!

Built in 1926 by P. Smit Jr. Shipbuilding and Machine Factory in Rotterdam, Netherlands, she was the last and largest steam- powered state-owned icebreaker of Finland. After two decades of successful service, Jääkarhu was handed over to the Soviet Union as war reparation in 1945 and renamed Sibiryakov. She remained in service until the 1970s and was broken up in 1972. == Background and construction == Jääkarhu leaving for sea trials in Rotterdam. When the Treaty of Tartu was signed on 14 October 1920, Finland agreed to return the Russian icebreakers that the Finnish White Guard had seized during the Civil War in 1918. As a result, the largest and most powerful state-owned icebreaker of Finland at that time, Wäinämöinen, was handed over to Estonia in 1922. Since both the size of the ships calling at the Finnish winter ports and the amount of exported goods, especially forest products, had increased considerably since the First World War, there was a definite need for a large and powerful icebreaker. One of the key issues was the beam of the existing icebreakers, , which was not enough for the new ships used to transport goods across the Atlantic Ocean.Laurell 1992, pp. 133–139. In 1923, the state allocated FIM 10 million for the design and development of a new icebreaker based on the experiences gained during the four years that Wäinämöinen had spent under the Finnish flag. The basic design of the new vessel, which was to have a beam of at least , was awarded to experienced Finnish naval architects K. Albin Johansson and Ossian Tybeck. By June 1923, bids ranging from FIM 20.2 to 35.5 million had been received from 24 shipyards representing eight nationalities. The most expensive offer was received from the Finnish Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstads Ab that was already building another new icebreaker, Voima, in Helsinki. In the end, the contract was awarded to the Dutch shipbuilder P. Smit Jr. Shipbuilding and Machine Factory from Rotterdam. The shipyard had recently constructed four ice- strengthened ships for the Finland Steamship Company and the technical director of the company had personally spent several weeks on board the Finnish icebreaker Sampo during the past winter. The contract for the construction of a new icebreaker was signed on 17 April 1924 after the Dutch government and the town council of Rotterdam agreed to subsidize the construction costs by 175,000 Dutch guilders, bringing the final cost to ƒ1,563,000 (FIM 26,000,000). She was launched on 26 August 1925Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant (26 August 1925 and 17 January 1926) and Het Centrum (24 December 1925). Excerpts available at \\"The building of the Finnish icebreaker Jääkarhu according to the Dutch newspapers in 1925–1926\\", Warshipresearch, 10 September 2011. and given the name Jääkarhu, Finnish for polar bear. Curiously, her namesake animal is not a native species to Finland.Polar bear cub becomes tourist magnet. YLE, 19 March 2012. As the new icebreaker was being built, Captain Johan Rosqvist, who has previously commanded Sampo, was selected as the first captain of the new icebreaker, and in the summer of 1925 he travelled to Rotterdam together with a chief engineer and a second engineer to supervise the construction and outfitting of his new ship. On 13 January 1926 Jääkarhu was ready for first sea trials in the North Sea. Although there were still issues with the oil-fired boilers by late February, it was agreed to take the delivery of the new icebreaker on 2 March 1926 and solve the problems later as the winter of 1926 had turned out to be very severe. Despite the best efforts of existing Finnish state-owned icebreakers, the ice conditions in the Gulf of Finland and the Sea of Åland were extremely difficult and vast pack ice fields closed off the shipping lanes outside the island of Utö at the edge of the Archipelago Sea. Although sometimes called the largest and most powerful icebreaker in the world by the press in the 1920s, Jääkarhu was no match for the Soviet polar icebreakers Yermak and Svyatogor that had nearly twice the displacement and over twice the power of the Finnish icebreaker. However, as a Baltic escort icebreaker she was considered better than the giants and was often compared with the Soviet icebreaker Lenin, which was roughly of the same size and was considered a very successful design.Ramsay 1949, p. 320–324. == Career  Early career === Jääkarhu in the port of Hanko. Jääkarhu left Rotterdam on 3 March 1926. When the new icebreaker arrived in Finland on 7 March, she was welcomed by a number of icebound ships outside Utö. After Sampo had arrived from Hanko with the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Tyko Reinikka, other representatives of the state, and members of the press, the newest and largest state-owned icebreaker demonstrated her power by easily overcoming the notorious pack ice fields surrounding the island and escorting a convoy of three merchant ships to the open seas. After spending her first winter escorting ships in the Gulf of Finland, Jääkarhu arrived in Helsinki on 27 April 1926. In July she was drydocked in Liepāja, Latvia, where her bottom was repainted. In 1926, Jääkarhu became the first Finnish icebreaker to adopt Finnish as the command language. Since the officers and most of the crew spoke Swedish as their first language, this resulted in negative comments from the Swedish-speaking minority, which considered Finnish to be \\"the language of the peasants\\", and even concerns about the safety of navigation. Captain Juho Lehtonen, who had replaced Rosqvist in July 1926, even received hate mail from Swedish-speaking citizens, some of whom questioned his professional competence after a minor collision with a Swedish steamer Yrsa on 18 January 1927.Laurell 1992, pp. 163–167.Kaukiainen 1992, p. 64. Jääkarhu assisting icebound merchant ships in a Finnish port. With the exception of the winter of 1929, the winters from 1927 until 1939 were relatively mild. Since Jääkarhu was the most expensive to operate among the Finnish state-owned icebreakers, she saw little action during these years as she was always the last icebreaker to leave, beginning her season Helsinki and then moving to Hanko, and the first one to return.Kaukiainen 1992, p. 114. During very mild winters she was not put into service at all. However, the winter of 1929 was extremely difficult and by February the Baltic Sea was covered by ice all the way to the Danish straits. Finnish, Swedish and Soviet icebreakers were sent to escort merchant ships through the straits, and on 22 February 1929 Jääkarhu was ordered to head south with a convoy of ships carrying export goods, assist and escort any icebound ship along the way and return with an inbound convoy to Turku and Hanko. She left on 24 February with a convoy of 12 ships and arrived at the edge of ice near Copenhagen on 4 March. After spending a few days assisting ships in the southern Baltic Sea, Jääkarhu began her journey home on 8 March and arrived in Hanko on 12 March. During the past 15 days she had, in addition to the ships in her own convoys, released and assisted 24 other ships and sailed .Laurell 1992, pp. 176–184. === Second World War === When relations with the Soviet Union deteriorated in late 1939 and the Winter War began on 30 November 1939, the Finnish state-owned icebreakers were armed and assigned to a wartime icebreaker flotilla. Jääkarhu was sent to the Gulf of Bothnia to escort ships across the Sea of Åland. Although she was often attacked by Soviet bombers, the enemy never scored a direct hit on the icebreaker, giving her a reputation of a lucky ship among the Finnish seafarers. After the Winter War ended with the 1940 Moscow Peace Treaty, Jääkarhu opened a channel to the icebound port of Hanko and helped to evacuate the city and the surrounding islands that had been leased to the Soviet Union as a naval base. During the period which later became known as the Interim Peace, Jääkarhu resumed her peacetime duties as an escort icebreaker in the Gulf of Finland.Laurell 1992, pp. 272–274. When the Continuation War started in June 1941, the state-owned icebreakers were again called to arms. On 13 September 1941, icebreakers Tarmo and Jääkarhu participated in Operation Nordwind together with Finnish and German naval ships.Laurell 1992, pp. 282–290 The joint Finnish-German distraction manoeuvre was a complete failure. Not only did it fail to achieve its goal – it is uncertain if the Soviet forces even noticed the fleet – but when the ships turned back, paravanes dragged a Soviet naval mine against the hull of Finnish coastal defence ship Ilmarinen, the flagship of the Finnish Navy, which sank in seven minutes following the explosion, claiming 271 lives.Panssarilaiva Ilmarisen tuho 13.9.1941. During the extremely difficult winter of 1942, Jääkarhu was paired up with the diesel-electric Sisu. On 2 February 1942, she ran aground while assisting an icebound convoy of six cargo ships, damaging her bow propeller. After returning from a dry dock in Stockholm, Sweden, Jääkarhu resumed her duties in the Gulf of Finland, and together with Sisu she escorted almost 700 merchant ships through the ice- infested waters. The winters of 1943 and 1944 were milder and Jääkarhu, being more expensive to operate than the smaller state-owned icebreakers, was not taken into service. When the Continuation War ended with the signing of the Moscow Armistice on 19 September 1944, Finland was forced to hand over its best ice-strengthened tonnage to the Soviet Union as war reparations. This included the newest steam-powered icebreakers Jääkarhu and Voima. === Later Soviet service === Jääkarhu and Voima were officially handed over to the Soviet Union as war reparations on 24 February 1945 after having been stationed in Leningrad since December 1944. Jääkarhu was renamed Sibiryakov after Alexander Mikhaylovich Sibiryakov, a Russian explorer of the Arctic regions, and another Russian icebreaker that had been sunk by the German cruiser Admiral Scheer in August 1942.Laurell 1992, pp. 292–294 During her time under the Soviet flag, Sibiryakov was a common sight in the Gulf of Finland and her familiar profile was easily recognized by the Finnish seafarers despite her Soviet colors and insignia. In the mid-1950s, she was sent to Rotterdam for modernization, which included installing two radar antennas and adding a new superstructure between the smoke stacks. Being one of the last large steam-powered icebreakers in active service, Sibiryakov was used in a 1960s Soviet documentary film to represent the steam-powered icebreaker, Yermak, which had been broken up in 1964. She was also used in the 1969 Soviet/Italian film The Red Tent to represent another Soviet icebreaker, Krasin, which had participated in the rescue mission of Umberto Nobile and other survivors of the crash of airship Italia in 1928. While the original 1917-built icebreaker was still in service at that time, her extensive rebuilding in 1953–1960 had changed the look of the vessel completely and thus a more traditional-looking icebreaker was needed for the role. Sibiryakov was retired after the winter of 1972 and sold for scrap. As the summer turned to autumn, she left the Baltic Sea for La Spezia, Italy, arriving at the breakers on 16 October 1972. == Technical details == Two of the three propellers installed on Jääkarhu used in an advertisement for the shipyard. Jääkarhu was long overall and at the waterline. Her hull had a moulded breadth of and was wide at the waterline. Her displacement was 4,836 tons at a draft of . These main dimensions made Jääkarhu by far the largest icebreaker in service under the Finnish flag at that time – she was more than longer and wider than the second-largest icebreaker, Tarmo, and had more than twice the displacement. Only the old Wäinämöinen, handed over to Estonia in 1922, came close with an overall length of , beam of and displacement of 3,619 tons.Laurell 1992, p. 344. Her bow, which had slightly rounder lines than the previous Finnish icebreakers,Ramsay 1949, pp. 315–324. had a stem angle of 23–25 degrees and her hull, protected by an ice belt up to thick, was divided into eight compartments by watertight transverse bulkheads. With a crew of 47, Jääkarhu had the largest crew among the Finnish steam-powered icebreakers even though she required less stokers than the older icebreakers due to her oil-fired boilers. Jääkarhu was also the most powerful steam-powered icebreaker ever commissioned in Finland. Her three triple-expansion steam engines, two with a maximum continuous rating of 2,500 ihp driving four-bladed nickel steel propellers weighing about 11 tons eachAdvertisement for Machinefabriek & Scheepswerf van P. Smit Jr. N.V. in the stern at 120 rpm, and one turning a third propeller of the same size in the bow at 130 rpm with a maximum continuous rating of 2,600 ihp. However, for short periods of time during icebreaking operations, the combined output of the engines could reach 9,200 ihp. Unlike the previous coal-burning icebreakers, Jääkarhu had eight oil- fired boilers with mechanical ventilation that consumed 2.5 to 4.5 tons of fuel oil per hour. Although she was the most expensive to operate, and for that reason she was always the last one to enter service and first one to sail back to her summer moorings, her endurance and range were considerably better than those of the older icebreakers since she could hold nearly 1,000 tons of fuel and required refueling only two or three times during normal winters. Like the old Wäinämöinen, Jääkarhu had a heeling system with two pumps capable of transferring 650 tons of ballast water per hour between side tanks, heeling the vessel up to five degrees in ten minutes. In addition, she had six centrifugal pumps for moving 100 tons of water in five minutes between the fore and aft peak tanks to adjust her trim and release the icebreaker from compressive ice. For escort operations she had a towing winch and a stern notch that was considerably larger than in the older icebreakers. Her single piece cast iron rudder weighed 9 tons. == References  Bibliography == * * * Category:Icebreakers of Finland Category:1925 ships Category:Ships built in the Netherlands Category:Icebreakers of the Soviet Union ","title":"Jääkarhu"},{"id":"35892212","text":"The molecular formula C29H44O3 may refer to: * Estradiol undecylate, an estrogen medication * Mesterolone cipionate, a synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroid and an androgen ester ","title":"C29H44O3"},{"id":"35892221","text":"The 2012 Rugby Super League season was the seventeenth and final season of the Rugby Super League, the United States premier division of rugby union, before being replaced by the USA Rugby Elite Cup.

At present cavers and cave divers have explored and linked together the caves from Manchester Hole through to New Goyden pot. The section from Goyden to New Goyden is only traversable with diving gear although cave diggers have opened up a way from New Goyden to Frog pot and have attempted to find and open up a link from Frog pot to Goyden pot. Cave divers have attempted to explore the link between New Goyden pot and Nidd Head. At New Goyden pot they have explored eight flooded passages (sumps) with various lengths of dry passages between. At the Nidd Head rising they have dived for over 850 metres with still about 1 km gap left to explore between the two caves. == Hydrology of the Goyden System  Normal conditions ===  Manchester Hole to Goyden Pot  Water from the moors above Angram and Scar House drains into the reservoirs, which in turn feed the River Nidd. Below Scar House dam the Nidd flows east then turns south, and shortly after disappears underground through a series of small fissures in the exposed limestone inlier. All the water from the various fissures enters the large stream passage of Manchester Hole. The underground stream can be followed along an impressive 3 to 4 sq m passage to the equally impressive massive blockfall cavern of the Main Chamber. Faulting here is not only responsible for the blocks but has allowed incursions of more than one stream to aid the process of block fall. At present one small stream enters at the southern end, but previous flooding such as in 1998 has opened up choked passages, allowing a large volume of water to enter Main Chamber. A huge section of the mud bank in that chamber collapsed and the flood subsiding refilled the passage. This process of opening and closing of inlets has probably been repeated many times over the centuries. The stream at the base of the chamber flows amongst fallen blocks to enter a passage of fine proportions, but the roof soon dips to where the stream enters a low area known as ‘the grovel’. The roof quickly rises again in Fossil Passage, where a narrow but high passage can be followed round more than one bend to a wider section. Here a small tube high up on the left leads to a permanently flooded section (static sump) 46m long that connects with Goyden Pot cave at Pillar Pot. The stream flowing through Manchester Hole does not connect with this static sump but instead flows onwards for a few metres to the ‘duck’. At the duck the stream make a sharp right turn almost flowing back on itself through a hands and knees crawl with limited airspace. After a few metres of the ‘duck’ the passage once again enlarges and the stream then flows on for a few more metres to enter downstream sump 1. This sump is 15m long and enters Divers Chamber. The stream flows out of the chamber along a short passage to enter sump 2, a small constricted passage that enters the Lesser Stream area of Goyden Pot.  Goyden Pot to New Goyden Pot  In the Lesser Stream passage of Goyden Pot the many fractures in the rock allows the stream to diverge and flow in different directions. Sandstone boulders are washed in from the surface through the numerous inlets in this area. These inlets are also opened and closed through the action of flooding. The various streams quickly unite and flow amongst the large boulders that form the floor of yet another impressive large breakdown chamber, Goyden Main Chamber. The stream then flows out from under the boulders and over the cascades to flow along the huge Main Stream Passage, 25m high in places and typically 6m wide for more than 150m, to where it flows into sump 1, 20m long. The river flows out of sump 1 past October Passage, which steals a small amount of the river. It then flows along another huge gallery into sump 2, 6m long. From there the river flows along the largest of the stream passages in Goyden to sump 3, 27m long. Here the river flows into Bridge Hall, where a small inlet on the left enters, probably the water from October Passage but as yet unconfirmed. At the far side of Bridge Hall is sump 4, just 2m long, and then a short section of passage to sump 5, about 57m long, and a lake airbell with choked inlet in the roof. Sump 6, 12m long, leads from the airbell to a short passage with a roof passage leading into the Aquamole series that can be entered via Frog Pot. At the end of the short passage sump 7 is a low obstructed sump that connects with the upstream sump 2 and sump 1 of New Goyden Pot.  New Goyden Pot to the Nidd Head Resurgences  The water flowing from upstream sump 1 flows along a very fine round railway tunnel sized passage to a bend, where a significant additional stream enters on the left. This is from Frog Pot and is the New Stream water from New Stream sump in Goyden pot. The combined waters flow along the huge tunnel to a short low flooded section, Middle Sump. At the far side of this sump the water flows for a short distance and then enters downstream sump 1. Divers have explored beyond sump 1 through another seven sumps. The water from this farthest point of exploration travels just over a kilometre to the furthest explored point of Nidd Head Resurgence. The Nidd actually resurges from three locations, the North West Rising, Main Rising and South East Rising. As the name suggests most of the water rises from the Main Rising and this has been explored by divers for over 850m. The North West Rising is presumed to flow from a point 119m into the Main Rising. The water from South East Rising has been explored for over 120m and is also thought to connect with the Main Rising. The risings combine. The river shortly afterwards is joined by How Stean Beck and flows down Nidderdale to Gouthwaite Reservoir. === Flood conditions === The Goyden system floods as a result of excess water overflowing the Scar House dam. This can happen not only following significant rainfall but also by wind action from a westerly or near westerly direction. The wind on a full or nearly full reservoir whips up waves on Scar House Reservoir sending water over the dam that on occasions has pushed down the valley more than one metre depth of water from the reservoir. The caves can therefore flood in a period of no rain but by wind action alone. The water flowing down the valley is typically greater than the capacity of the fissures taking water into Manchester Hole. So most of the water flows past the Manchester Hole and onwards to Goyden Pot Main entrance. At various times old abandoned inlets are re-opened and re-closed by the flood waters allowing water to enter the far reaches of Manchester Hole and Lesser Stream passage of Goyden Pot. The increased flow into Manchester Hole and a pooling effect by the constricted sump 2, with possibly reopened inlets, causes the far end (between the ‘grovel’ and the ‘duck’) of Manchester cave to flood, at times very quickly. Water flowing into Goyden Pot Main entrance falls into the Main Chamber from high level passages from the first and then second and eventually the third window. This water joins the river flowing from Manchester Hole over the cascades and along the Main Stream passage. The swollen river flows through to sump 7 which due to its constricted nature causes the water to back up and flood the system from there all the way back. The rising water enters the roof passage between sump 6 and sump 7 taking with it much debris. The water flows along this passage into Toad Hall and through the 30m sump into Frog Pot, where it joins the New Stream water from Goyden Pot, New Stream sump. The combined flood waters flow into New Goyden Pot via Main Stream inlet to join the increased water from upstream sumps 1 and 2 in New Goyden. This water backing up through the system is first seen to rise in Frog Pot then Guscott Pot, Limley Pot, Church Pot and then Goyden Pot. By this time the far end of Manchester Hole has already flooded by the mechanism mentioned before. The whole system floods completely with the exception of Manchester Hole from the entrance to the ‘grovel’. The latter has been confirmed by leaving markers in the roof of Manchester Hole amongst the flood debris. The markers remained even in very high flood conditions in the rest of the system, which suggests that the flood debris present in the roof dates from before the construction of Scarhouse reservoir. Once Goyden is full water is forced past Goyden Pot Main entrance down the valley on the surface past the village of Lofthouse through to Gouthwaite Reservoir. In severe floods water mushrooms out of Church Pot, Limley Pot and New Goyden Pot, while Guscott Pot and Frog Pot still take water. In the most severe floods the River Nidd rises enough to lap into or small flow into Manchester Hole main entrance. == Geology == The caves of Upper Nidderdale are extensive, impressive and have unique characteristics within the UK.T.D. Ford (1963) CRG Vol 6 No. 2J. Gunn(2006) *The cave system is largely developed beneath a major valley floor with many of the passages still beneath a cover of Millstone Grit or Upper Yoredales. (Ford 1963) *It has developed across a number of geological structures including an anticline and several faults (Ford 1963) *In Manchester Hole vadose downcutting has breached the base of the limestone and cut into the underlying strata (Ford 1963) *Studies have confirmed that wind action on the Scar House Reservoir when full or nearly full can create significant overflow causing serious flooding of the caves further down the valley.(Gunn 2006) Nidderdale is at about the same altitude as Wharfedale and separated by just one ridge including the summit of Great Whernside. The Great Scar limestone so evident in Wharfedale is nowhere to be seen in Nidderdale as the easterly dip of the Pennine anticline carries it well below the floor of this small valley. The limestone visible in Nidderdale is the Yoredale series, and almost all the cave system has developed within the narrow band (maximum of 40m) of the Middle Limestone. The limestone outcrops in three inliers: one to the north including the cave sinks of Manchester Hole and Goyden pot, one small outcrop about 300m further south including New Goyden pot, and one nearly 2 km further south including the Nidd Head resurgences. The most northern inlier of limestone is cut off from the limestone beds at Scar House Reservoir by a large fault. The most southern inlier of limestone is cut off from any continuation by a fault just north of the head of Gouthwaite Reservoir. Each inlier is separated on the surface by the base of the Grassington Grit. The cave system is contained within the Middle Limestone and chiefly developed along the shale partings of the bedding planes. The faults frequently mark the position of the sumps (permanently flooded sections of the cave), and between faults there are significant open passages. The cave drains water from north to south but the faulting in the middle inlier is responsible for water locally draining south to north under the normally dry river bed on the surface. This means that in flood conditions water on the surface drains north to south while the water in the large cave passage beneath drains briefly in the opposite direction before turning east and then back south. Because the system is contained within a narrow band and chiefly covered by grit, it surprised early explorers that there were long sections of large passages such as Goyden’s and New Goyden’s main stream. Goyden’s is typically about 6m wide and 25m high vadose canyon with small phreatic passage at the top. New Goyden’s passage is typically about 8m diameter phreatic tunnel. What did not surprise early explorers was that the system is chiefly developed on one level. However further study and exploration has shown higher abandoned levels of development, on shale bands. These have been opened up by cave diggers and used to connect the caves of Nidderdale with dry connections after cave divers had explored the underwater links between the caves. Distinctive fossil and chert beds so common a characteristic of the middle limestone are well exposed in the caves and provide some impressive examples. Fine examples of the chert bands are visible in Goyden pot Main Stream Passage, the Turf and especially the Beet Route passage above High Rift. Chert bands are also visible in New Goyden pot in the Main Stream passage, Main inlet and Dry Wath series. Impressive examples of Productus Giganteus fossils are present in the Fossil passage area of Manchester Hole and on the surface by the intake fissures. Fossilised coral and many examples of crinoids are clearly visible in quite a few of the caves but especially in Goyden pot. == References  Sources== *Northern caves 1, Wharfedale & The North-East, Dalesman Books 1988, D.Brook, G.M.

He also met Gabrielle Moreau, his future wife, while he was there. In the early 1880s, one of his artist friends, Hersart du Buron, encouraged him to go to Brittany with him to find landscapes they could paint. They visited the island of Ushant, Le Faouët and Châteauneuf-du-Faou before reaching Pont-Aven, where they stayed with his friend's cousins. In 1886, during one of his many stays in the village, he met Paul Gauguin and Émile Bernard.\\"Henri Delavallée\\", Le Cabinet Rémois de la Généalogie. Retrieved 21 May 2012.L'aventure de Pont-Aven et Gauguin, Paris, Skira, 2003, page 88. In 1887, thanks to his friend Félix Bracquemond, he was introduced to Camille Pissarro and Georges Seurat. He worked with Pissarro, whose approach he particularly appreciated, in Marlotte, producing works in the Divisionist and Pointillist styles. In 1889, he also made etchings. From 1891 to 1896, he exhibited at Paul Durand-Ruel's gallery, at the Société des Amis des Arts in Nantes, and at the Paris Salons. In 1894, he met Paul Gauguin in Pont-Aven. In May 1895, he exhibited three works at Liège. In 1896, the family left Paris for Constantinople where he and his wife mixed with Turkish high society. In 1901, they returned to France and established their home in Pont-Aven where they associated with Théodore Botrel. In 1941, the Galerie Saluden in Quimper put on a retrospective of his work. He died in 1943 in Pont-Aven where he is buried. ==Gallery== File:Delavallée Bretonne pipe.jpgHenri Delavallée's engraving Bretonne fumant la pipe devant l'âtre File:Delavallee La Rue au soleil 1887.jpgHenri Delavallée's La rue au soleil à Port-Manech.

Arxan's security products are used to prevent tampering or reverse engineering of software, thus preventing access or modifications to said software that are deemed undesirable by its developer. The company reports that applications secured by it are running on over 500 million devices. Its products are used across a range of industries, including mobile payments & banking, automotive, healthcare and gaming. ==History== Arxan is privately held and private equity-backed. In the fall of 2013, TA Associates, a private equity firm, completed a majority investment in Arxan Technologies. Previously, the company received Series B funding in 2003, followed by $13 million in Series C funding in 2007 and a Series D funding of $4 million in 2009. Early investors included Trident Capital, EDF Ventures, Legend Ventures, Paladin Capital, Dunrath Capital, TDF Fund and Solstice Capital. Arxan was founded in 2001 by Eric Davis and Purdue University researchers, Mikhail Atallah, Tim Korb, John Rice and Hoi Chang. The first funding came from Richard Early and Dunrath Capital. Rich Early subsequently became Arxan's first CEO. The company's early intellectual property was licensed from Purdue University. The company's initial focus was on defense anti-tamper applications. Following the sale of its defense technology unit, Arxan Defense Systems, to Microsemi in 2010, Arxan focused on commercial applications. In April 2020, Arxan Technologies joined CollabNet VersionOne and XebiaLabs to form Digital.ai, a software company with the stated aim of 'pulling software development, business agility and application security into a single platform'. ==Products== Arxan offers a number of Anti-Tamper Software products for application and cryptographic key protection. These include: *Arxan Code Protection to secure Mobile, IoT & Embedded, Desktop and Server applications *Arxan Cryptographic Key & Data Protection to secure secret keys and data with white-box cryptography, which provide all the major crypto algorithms and features required to protect sensitive keys and data in hostile or untrusted operational environments. Arxan Cryptographic Key & Data Protection is FIPS140-2 validated. In May 2012, the company announced comprehensive support for Android application protection and hardening against tampering and piracy. In June 2014, Arxan announced that its mobile application protection offerings will be sold by IBM as part of IBM's portfolio of security products. Arxan's products are based on patented security techniques for code hardening, tamper-proofing, key security and node locking. The core technology consists of a multi-layered, interconnected network of Guards that each perform a specific security function and are embedded into application binaries to make programs tamper-aware, tamper- resistant, and self-healing. The company claims a three-layer protection paradigm of defend, detect and react as a differentiating approach. By detecting when an attack is being attempted and responding to detected attacks with alerts and repairs, this protection helps secure software against hacking attacks and threats such as: * static reverse engineering or code analysis * dynamic reverse engineering or debugging * tampering to disable or circumvent security mechanisms (authentication, encryption, anti-virus, security policies, etc.) * tampering to modify program functionality * tampering for piracy or unauthorized use * insertion of malware into an application * counterfeiting and IP theft * stealing of cryptographic keys === IoT anti- tamper === Arxan's IoT products insert the anti-tamper protection into the firmware of the device itself, causing parts of the code to continually check each other for integrity. If any tamper attempt is detected, Arxan's product can either attempt to restore the code to its original form, stop the firmware from running entirely, send a notification to the developer or any combination of the three. === DRM === Its DRM solutions have been compared to their competitor Denuvo, with both working to provide a layer of anti-tamper security on top of already existing copy protection mechanisms added by the developer. This results in a multi-layered approach in which the original DRM software protects the software from unauthorized copying, modification or use, while Arxan prevents any attempt to remove or alter said protection. However, much like with Denuvo's application of it, this approach has also been criticised for increasing the use of system resources. Arxan has previously expressed strong confidence that its DRM solutions would not be cracked, but in fact cracks or bypasses for Arxan products have been shown to exist; in one example Zoo Tycoon Ultimate Animal Collection was successfully cracked in 2018 while using a five-layer approach featuring UWP, XbLA, MSStore, EAppX and Arxan protection simultaneously. Several more bypasses of Arxan's protection have since emerged in 2018 and 2019, with Arxan-protected Gears 5 being cracked by a scene group less than two weeks following its original release. ==Media and awards== * Deloitte 2014 Top 500 Fastest Growing Technology Company * CIOReview Magazine 2014 Top 50 Most Promising IoT Companies * 2015 Mobile Innovations Award Winner for Best Management of Mobile Security Issues * Info Security Products Guide 2014 Winner for Best New Product: Mobile Application Integrity Protection™ Suite v 5.0 == See also == * Tamper resistance * Application Security * Encryption * Content Protection * Digital rights management * Cryptographic Key Types * Obfuscated Code * Cryptography ==References== Category:Companies based in San Francisco Category:Cryptography companies Category:Computer security software companies ","title":"Arxan Technologies"},{"id":"35892473","text":"Tony Berrian (born February 12, 1979) is an American former sprinter. ==References== Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:American male sprinters Category:Universiade medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Universiade gold medalists for the United States Category:Medalists at the 1999 Summer Universiade ","title":"Tony Berrian"},{"id":"35892474","text":"Daniel \\"Homeless\\" Mustard (born December 25, 1975) is an American singer- songwriter and musician.

Published in 1955, The Secret River received a Newbery Honor Award. The first edition, illustrated by Caldecott Medal winner Leonard Weisgard, was issued after Rawlings' death. The book was revised and reissued in 2009 with illustrations by Caldecott Medalists Leo and Diane Dillon. The new edition received an international children's book design award in 2012. The Secret River is the only book Rawlings wrote specifically for children. The story of young Calpurnia, who goes on a quest to find a magical river and catch fish for her starving family and friends, it has two themes common in Rawlings' writing, the magic of childhood and the struggle of people to survive in a harsh environment. ==Plot== The Secret River is a story of Magical realism, blending real life and fantasy. Young Calpurnia is an aspiring poet living in rural Central Florida during the Great Depression. Hard times have come to her people; the animals have disappeared, her father is unable to catch fish to sell, and everyone in the community is too weak from hunger to work. Calpurnia bravely leaves home with her little dog, Buggy- Horse, to find the secret river that her neighbor Mother Albirtha has told her about. She intends to catch fish for her father to sell in his shop. When she finds the river she politely asks it to allow her to catch some fish and uses her creativity, and the pink ribbons from her hair, to catch them. On her way home, an owl, a bear and a panther each challenge her, and she has to give away some of her catch to get home. She also shares some fish with Mother Albirtha and takes the rest to her father, who gives them to the starving people in return for future payment. Strengthened by the fish, people begin working again. When the crisis is past Calpurnia searches for the river again, but cannot find it, as she no longer really needs it. Still, she realizes nothing is lost to us forever, and the book ends with one of her poems, expressing this sentiment: ==Background== The Secret River is Rawlings' only book intended for children. According to Murray Laurie, the idea for the book came from something Rawlings had written in Cross Creek: \\"some day a poet will write a sad and lovely story of a Negro child.\\" She discussed the idea with her Scribner's editor, Maxwell Perkins, who encouraged her to follow it up. While working on the manuscript she told Perkins she \\"deliberately avoided Negro dialect. 'No Uncle Remus or Little Black Sambo sort of stuff. At one point she thought about making the story into a full-length novel. Helen Masten, writing for The Saturday Review, commented \\"Had this happened this little masterpiece of the imagination of childhood might never have reached children, to whom it rightly belongs.\\" Rawlings also talked about her ideas with Bob Camp, an illustrator and friend. From that conversation, Camp produced a series of paintings to illustrate the idea. In 1947 Rawlings sent The Secret River's manuscript to Perkins, and Camp visited his office in New York with the paintings. When Perkins responded with suggestions, Rawlings confessed to him that she was not completely pleased with Camp's illustrations. By June of that year, Perkins' death from pneumonia and Rawlings' own personal problems had derailed the project. After Rawlings' death in 1953, the manuscript for The Secret River was the only complete manuscript found among her papers. In Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' Rivers Lamar York says that Rawlings' settings are an essential part of her plots, and that she did not choose to write about a river by accident. At a low time in her life she had taken time off and traveled the length of the St. Johns River with a friend. Later she wrote about the boat trip in \\"Hyacinth Drift\\", a chapter of Cross Creek. The trip, she said, cured her depression and allowed her to live in peace, as The Secret River did for Calpurnia and her community. The river, York writes, expresses Rawlings' belief that \\"man must know or discover a relationship to a suitable physical setting\\" in order to survive the harshness of the world, as she herself did on the St. Johns. ==Themes== The Secret River's primary theme revolves around Calpurnia's desire to help her family and friends survive tough times. As Barbara Elleman wrote in School Library Journal, \\"Overriding the adventure is the determination and spirited effort of the child to help her family in need.\\" The struggle to live in the face of difficult circumstances was a common theme for Rawlings.Chevalier, Tracy (editor), Twentieth-Century Children's Writers, St. James Press, 1989, p. 809; In The Secret River this struggle means Calpurnia must find her way to the river, convince it to yield its precious fish, then overcome danger from starving wild animals to return with the fish to her father. Calpurnia's courage and determination enable her to overcome every obstacle and save her community. Juxtaposed against the struggle to survive is the enchanting but short beauty of childhood.Cech, John (editor), Dictionary of Literary Biographies: American Writers for Children, 1900-1960, Gale Research, 1983, volume 22, p. 285; The magic in the plot reinforces the sense of enchantment and gives the book a fairy-tale like quality, leading the BolognaRagazzi Awards jury to speak of \\"the great Secret (that) lurks in the story\\". It is the child Calpurnia who follows the magic to find the river and save the adults from starvation. The contrast of an idealized and protected childhood with the harsh realities that adults must face is another theme common to Rawlings' writings, expressed in the famous speech about adult reality Ezra \\"Penny\\" Baxter delivers to his son Jody at the end of The Yearling: \\"Ever' man wants life to be a fine thing, and easy. 'Tis fine, boy, powerful fine, but 'tain't easy. Life knocks a man down and he gits up and it knocks him down again. . . . What's he to do then? . . . Why, take it for his share and go on.\\" Unlike Jody, who realizes the magic of his childhood is \\"gone forever\\" with the death of his fawn, Calpurnia retains the secret river and the magic in her mind. ==Editions, awards== The Secret River appeared two years after Rawlings' death with illustrations by the 1948 Caldecott Medal winner Leonard Weisgard, who used coffee-coloured paper as an innovative way to circumvent a taboo of the era against portraying dark-skinned characters. In his book In the Company of Writers, Charles Scribner discusses The Secret River's publication, noting Rawlings never mentions Calpurnia's race. Since the book went into production after her death Rawlings could not be consulted about her final intentions. At this time the depiction of black children in American children's literature had decreased until it was almost non-existent. While a few books were still appearing, \\"White (children's) publishers were still not open to books with Black themes\\", according to Joyce Braden Harris on \\"African and African-American Traditions in Language Arts\\". Scribner pointed out that \\"Whatever our decision, we could land on the wrong side of the school boards\\", and claims the idea for using dark paper in the book as a way to suggest Calpurnia's race was his, calling it \\"one of my silent contributions to dissolving the color barrier in the 1950s.\\" The book received a Newbery Honor Award in 1956 for \\"the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\\", and was honored by the American Society of Graphic Arts. Atheneum Books for Young Readers reissued a revised version of the book in 2009. The story was shortened by cutting some descriptive passages and allowing the illustrations to convey the setting. Calpurnia's final poem was also eliminated. New illustrations in acrylics were created by Leo and Diane Dillon, who went on to win two Caldecott Awards. Unlike the more realistic illustrations by Weisgard, the Dillons emphasized the magical reality of the story, as in the cover picture, where Calpurnia's profile is almost hidden inside a stylized blue fish. Mary Harris Russell, writing for The Chicago Tribune, felt modern audiences would appreciate the way \\"the fantasy side to this land of cypress trees and silent rivers is amplified and contrasted with the realistic background of little Calpurnia's life.\\" The Dillon's version of The Secret River received one of two honorable mentions in the fiction category of the 2012 BolognaRagazzi Awards, an international children's book award that honors the art and design of illustrated books worldwide. In the words of the Bologna jury, \\"It is only fitting that Marjorie Rawlings, the great American writer loved by so many generations of readers, is finally paid such a refined and sensitive tribute.\\" ==Critical reception== When The Secret River first appeared in 1955, Saturday Review called it a \\"little masterpiece of the imagination of childhood... so real and appealing one regrets that this is the only book the author wrote for children... Leonard Weisgard has done some of his most sensitive work in drawings that have a feeling for character and place and are quite perfect for the text.\\" Decades later the book continued to receive strong reviews, with words like \\"Magical\\" and \\"timeless\\".Silvey, Anita (editor), The Essential Guide to Children's Books and Their Creators, Houghton Mifflin, 2002, p. 379; Reviewers appreciated the message of hope conveyed in the simple story. The new edition of The Secret River also received positive reviews. Publishers Weekly gave it a starred review, as did Kirkus Reviews, calling it a \\"classic tale... Rawlings' voice is warm and tender, employing lilting syntax and descriptive language that resonates with warmth and humor. Calpurnia is a sweet delight... filled with love and compassion\\", and the Dillon's illustrations are, \\"glorious, glowing... nothing short of breathtaking\\". Monica and Hannah McRae Young, in their article \\"Books do justice to subjects of civil rights, racism\\", praise The Secret River as \\"A rare picture book depicting everyday black life\\". They believe modern readers will enjoy Calpunia and Buggy-horse as much as the original audience. Children's Literature agreed that the reissue would renew interest in the book. ==References* * Category:1955 American novels Category:1955 children's books Category:Newbery Honor-winning works Category:American young adult novels Category:American children's novels Category:American picture books Category:Novels set in Florida Category:Great Depression novels ","title":"The Secret River (Rawlings book)"},{"id":"35892551","text":"Rana Vachhraj was a king of Lohar-Gadha in 13th century AD in what is now Afghanistan.

After his release in 2000, he embarked on a career in non-league football. == Career  Brentford === A left winger or forward, James began his career in the youth system at Brentford and signed a one-year professional contract at the end of the 1998–99 season. He made one appearance for the club, as a late substitute for Lloyd Owusu during a 1–0 Second Division defeat to Stoke City on 8 April 2000. James was released in May 2000 and the 8 minutes he spent on the pitch on his debut makes his one of the shortest Brentford first team careers. === Non-league football === James joined Isthmian League Premier Division club Slough Town on loan in August 2000 and returned to Arbour Park on a permanent basis in August 2001, but suffered a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in pre-season friendly versus Maidenhead United in 2002. He reunited with his former Slough Town manager Steve Browne at Isthmian League First Division North club Boreham Wood in June 2003. James followed Browne out of Meadow Park when Browne was sacked in January 2004. He finished the 2003–04 season with Burnham, before joining Hayes in time for the beginning of the 2004–05 season. James scored one goal in four appearances before being released in September 2004 and after a brief spell with Hemel Hempstead Town, he moved to Staines Town in February 2005. He remained with Staines Town until 2008 and briefly played for Enfield Town, before moving to Kingstonian in early 2009. He played seven games for the Ks before leaving on 27 July 2009. == Career statistics == {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" +Appearances and goals by club, season and competition ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Club ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Season ! colspan=\\"3\\" League ! colspan=\\"2\\" FA Cup ! colspan=\\"2\\" League Cup ! colspan=\\"2\\" Other ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total - !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals - Brentford 1999–00 Second Division 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 - Slough Town (loan) 2000–01 Isthmian League Premier Division 1 0  colspan=\\"2\\" —  colspan=\\"2\\" — 31 appearance in FA Trophy, 1 appearance in Isthmian League Full Members Cup, 1 appearance in Isthmian League Cup 1 4 1 -  rowspan=\\"3\\" Slough Town 2001–02 Isthmian League First Division 31 3 1 0  colspan=\\"2\\" — 52 appearances in Isthmian League Cup, 2 appearances in Berks & Bucks Senior Cup, 1 appearance in FA Trophy 0 37 3 - 2002–03 Isthmian League First Division North 1 0 0 0  colspan=\\"2\\" — 0 0 1 0 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Slough Town total !33 !3 !1 !0 ! colspan=\\"2\\" — !8 !1 !42 !4 - Boreham Wood 2003–04 Isthmian League First Division North 20 3 0 0  colspan=\\"2\\" — 0 0 31 4 - Burnham 2003–04 Southern League First Division East 11 0  colspan=\\"2\\" —  colspan=\\"2\\" —  colspan=\\"2\\" — 11 0 - Hayes 2004–05 Conference South 4 1 0 0  colspan=\\"2\\" — 0 0 4 1 - Hemel Hempstead Town 2004–05 Southern League Premier Division 1 0  colspan=\\"2\\" —  colspan=\\"2\\" — 0 0 1 0 -  rowspan=\\"5\\" Staines Town 2004–05  rowspan=\\"4\\" Isthmian League Premier Division 9 1  colspan=\\"2\\" —  colspan=\\"2\\" —  colspan=\\"2\\" — 9 1 - 2005–06 16 1 0 0  colspan=\\"2\\" — 1Appearance in Isthmian League Cup 0 17 1 - 2006–07 7 0 0 0  colspan=\\"2\\" — 1 0 8 0 - 2008–09 3 0 0 0  colspan=\\"2\\" — 0 0 3 0 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Total !35 !2 !0 !0 ! colspan=\\"2\\" — !2 !0 !37 !2 -  rowspan=\\"2\\" Slough Town (loan) 2007–08 Southern League First Division South & West 4 0  colspan=\\"2\\" —  colspan=\\"2\\" —  colspan=\\"2\\" — 4 0 - ! colspan=\\"2\\" Slough Town total !37 !3 !1 !0 ! colspan=\\"2\\" — !8 !1 !46 !4 - Enfield Town 2008–09 Isthmian League First Division North 2 0  colspan=\\"2\\" —  colspan=\\"2\\" —  colspan=\\"2\\" — 2 0 - Kingstonian 2008–09 Isthmian League First Division South 4 0  colspan=\\"2\\" —  colspan=\\"2\\" — 31 appearance in Isthmian League Cup, 1 appearance in Surrey Senior Cup, 1 appearance in London Senior Cup 0 7 0 - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Career total !115 !9 !1 !0 !0 !0 !10 !1 !126 !10 } ==References * Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Brentford F.C. players Category:Slough Town F.C. players Category:Boreham Wood F.C. players Category:Burnham F.C. players Category:Hayes F.C. players Category:Staines Town F.C. players Category:Enfield Town F.C. players Category:Kingstonian F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Association football wingers Category:Association football forwards Category:Hemel Hempstead Town F.C. players Category:Isthmian League players Category:Southern Football League players Category:National League (English football) players Category:People from Bracknell ","title":"Clement James (footballer)"},{"id":"35892567","text":"The 2012 Coca-Cola 600, the 53rd annual race, was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series stock car race held on May 27, 2012, at Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina. Contested over 400 laps, it was the twelfth race of the 2012 season. Kasey Kahne of Hendrick Motorsports took his first win of the season, while Denny Hamlin finished second and Kyle Busch finished third. ==ReportBackground=== Charlotte Motor Speedway, the race track where the race was held. Charlotte Motor Speedway is one of ten intermediate tracks to hold NASCAR races; the others are Atlanta Motor Speedway, Kansas Speedway, Chicagoland Speedway, Darlington Raceway, Homestead Miami Speedway, New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Kentucky Speedway, Las Vegas Motor Speedway, and Texas Motor Speedway. The standard track at Charlotte Motor Speedway is a four-turn quad-oval track that is long. The track's turns are banked at twenty-four degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is five degrees. The back stretch, opposite of the front, also had a five degree banking. The racetrack has seats for 140,000 spectators. Before the race, Greg Biffle led the Drivers' Championship with 411 points, while Matt Kenseth stood in second with 409. Dale Earnhardt Jr. was third in the Drivers' Championship with 397 points, three points ahead of Denny Hamlin and twenty- five ahead of Jimmie Johnson in fourth and fifth. Martin Truex Jr. with 372 was three points ahead of Tony Stewart, as Kevin Harvick with 361 points, was twelve ahead of Kyle Busch, and twenty-four in front of Carl Edwards. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet was leading with 72 points, eight ahead of Toyota. Ford, with 57 points, was eight points ahead of Dodge in the battle for third. Harvick was the race's defending race winner after winning it in 2011. The Coca-Cola 600 was conceived by race car driver Curtis Turner, who built the Charlotte Motor Speedway. It was first held in 1960 in an attempt by NASCAR to stage a Memorial Day weekend race to compete with the open-wheel Indianapolis 500; the two races were held together on the same day starting from 1974. The race is the longest in terms of distance on the NASCAR calendar and is considered by several drivers to be one of the sport's most important races alongside the Daytona 500, the Brickyard 400 and the Southern 500. The long distance makes it the most physically demanding event in NASCAR, and teams adapt to changing track conditions because the race occurs between late afternoon and evening. It was known as the World 600 until 1984 when The Coca- Cola Company purchased the naming rights to the race and renamed it the Coca- Cola World 600 in 1985. It has been called the Coca-Cola 600 every year since 1986 except for 2002 when the name changed to Coca-Cola Racing Family 600. ===Practice and qualifying=== Aric Almirola qualified on the pole position for Richard Petty Motorsports Three practice sessions were held before the race; the first on May 24, 2012, which lasted 120 minutes. The second and third took place on Saturday, May 26, 2012. The first Saturday practice lasted 55 minutes, while the second was 60 minutes. Marcos Ambrose was quickest with a time of 28.539 seconds in the first session, five-thousandths of a second faster than Landon Cassill. A. J. Allmendinger was third quickest, followed by Biffle, Clint Bowyer, and Aric Almirola. Joey Logano was seventh, still within two-tenths of a second of Ambrose's time. Forty-seven cars were entered for qualifying on May 24, 2012, but only forty-three could qualify for the race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Almirola of Richard Petty Motorsports clinched the first pole position of his Sprint Cup Series career, with a time of 27.988 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by his teammate Ambrose. Johnson qualified third, Biffle took fourth, and Bowyer started fifth. Mark Martin, Kasey Kahne, Hamlin, Paul Menard and Regan Smith rounded out the top ten. Kurt Busch failed to finish his qualifying lap after colliding into the SAFER barrier, but will remain on the grid as his team is in the Top 35 in owner's points. The four drivers that failed to qualify for the race were Mike Bliss, David Reutimann, J. J. Yeley and Scott Riggs. Once the qualifying session was completed, Almirola stated \\"It's a huge honor just to see it in victory lane (for the pole celebration). I'm driving probably the most iconic car in history of the sport. It's just qualifying, but that's a start.\\" Afterward, Johnson, who won the week before in the NASCAR Sprint All- Star Race XXVIII, commented about their recent performances, \\"I'm real proud of where our equipment is going.\\" He continued, \\"I've been able to race better than where we qualify.\\" In the second practice session, Hamlin was fastest with a time of 28.995 seconds, less than two-hundredths of a second quicker than second-placed Menard. Edwards took third place, ahead of Truex Jr., Johnson and Brad Keselowski. Bowyer, Harvick and Ryan Newman completed the ten quickest drivers in the session. In the third and final practice, Keselowski was quickest with a time of 29.397 seconds. Edwards followed in second, ahead of Martin and Johnson. Logano was fifth quickest, with a time of 29.521 seconds. Stewart, Kenseth, Allmendinger, Kurt Busch, and Jeff Burton rounded out the first ten positions. Hamlin, who was quickest in the second session, could only manage 20th. ===Race=== Kasey Kahne won the race for Hendrick Motorsports The race, the twelfth in the season, began at 6:00 p.m. EDT and was televised live in the United States on Fox. The conditions on the grid were dry before the race, the air temperature at ; mostly clear skies were expected. Darrell Waltrip began pre-race ceremonies, by giving the invocation. Next, Charlotte Fire Department Pipe Bag played \\"Amazing Grace\\", then Darius Rucker performed the national anthem. Afterward, retired U.S. Navy admiral, Frank Thorp and director of the United States Army Wounded Warrior Program, Gregory Gadson, with the addition of actress Brooklyn Decker gave the command for drivers to start their engines. Following the traditional three pace laps, Phoenix Racing's Kurt Busch dropped to the rear of the grid due to changing to a backup car after crashing in qualifying. Richard Petty Motorsports teammates Almirola and Ambrose led the 43-car field to the green flag, the teammates swapped the lead for the first 8 laps until Roush Fenway Racing's Biffle assumed the top spot on lap 9 from Ambrose. While Ambrose retook the lead from Biffle on lap 15, Almirola steadily fell back to 5th place. By lap 23, Biffle retook the lead from Ambrose and moved out to a 1-second lead. On lap 41, Allmendinger was the first driver to pit in a series of green-flag pit stops. Biffle made his stop along with Johnson on lap 47 and was able to hold the lead after pit stops were completed. The race continued under green, and drivers stopped for another round of pit stops between laps 87 and 97. Once again, Biffle was one of the last cars to pit, and came out with the lead, extending it to 4 seconds. On lap 111, the first caution of the race came out when debris was sighted on the backstretch. The leaders pitted, and Ambrose and Jamie McMurray took two right side tires on their stops to claim the top two spots. However, McMurray was forced back into the pits after the restart for a loose wheel. On lap 125, Kyle Busch grabbed the lead from Biffle, who took it back two laps later after Busch dipped the tires below the white line. Debris was spotted in turn 1, forcing the second caution of the race. All the leaders pitted except for Jeff Gordon. On the restart on lap 139, Busch, Johnson, and Biffle easily dispatched Gordon to take the top three spots. Kasey Kahne scores a victory in his 300th career start. ==ResultsQualifying=== {  - ! !

The full title is An Act to Authorize Appropriations for fiscal year 2013 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes. This law has been assigned the number PL 112–239. ==Information regarding the bill prior to bill enactment== So as to not have the Act run into the same legal trouble as the 2012 version did, the United States House of Representatives included section 1029, which affirmed the right of habeas corpus and the Constitutional right of due process for American citizens. However, there were criticisms of the Act, especially with regard to a \\"readiness\\" and funding for an attack on Iran. Criticism had also been voiced regarding section 1033 of the House bill version which would state that nothing in the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107–40) or the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112–81) shall be construed to deny the availability of the writ of habeas corpus in a court ordained or established by or under Article III of the Constitution for any person who is detained in the United States pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107–40). ==Bill enactment history, content and reactions== thumbright300pxHouse vote by congressional district. thumbright300pxSenate vote by state. thumbright300pxH Amdt 1127 Repeals Indefinite Military Detention Provisions House vote by congressional district.[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2012/h270 On Agreeing to the Amendment: Amendment 29 to H R 4310] thumbright300px''' S Amdt 3018 - Prohibits the Indefinite Detention of Citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents Senate vote by state.[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2012/s213 On the Amendment S.Amdt. 3018 to S. 3254 (National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013)] The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2013 passed the House Armed Services Committee 56–5 on May 10. The bill as reported to the House authorizes $554.2 billion in base Pentagon spending and $88.5 billion for overseas contingency operations (OCO). The bill passed the full House on May 18 by a vote of 299–120. The bill was approved by the Senate on December 4, 2012 by a vote of 98–0. The U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate passed the Conference Report on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 in December 2012. The House passed it on December 20, 2012 with a vote of 315 yeas to 107 noes; the Senate passed it on December 21, 2012 with a vote of 81 yeas to 14 noes. President Barack Obama signed the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act on January 2, 2013. The bill authorizes fiscal year 2013 appropriations for Department of Defense programs and military construction, Department of Energy national security programs, and Department of Transportation maritime security programs; authorizes recruitment and retention bonuses, special payments, and other authorities relating to the U.S. Armed Forces; and makes other modifications to national security, foreign affairs, and other related programs. The enacted act sets the U.S. Armed Forces' budget for the 2013 fiscal year to $633 billion. It also contains a prohibition on transferring Guantanamo detainees to the U.S and also includes the Afghan Women and Girl's Security Promotion Act. In his signing statement to the Act Obama stated \\"Even though I support the vast majority of the provisions contained in [NDAA] I do not agree with them all. ... Though I continue to oppose certain sections of the Act, the need to renew critical defense authorities and funding was too great to ignore.\\" Among these provisions are those that effectively thwart Obama's efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and give military members the right to refuse to take certain actions that violate their conscience. The president was criticized by civil rights and human rights organizations for his signing. American Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Anthony D. Romero said with respect to the 2012 NDAA indefinite detention provisions and Obama's signature under the 2013 NDAA: \\"His signature means that indefinite detention without charge or trial, as well as the illegal military commissions, will be extended.\\" \\"This law makes it harder for the President to fulfill his promise to close the Guantanamo detention facility, perpetuating a grave injustice against the detainees held without charge or fair trial,\\" said Frank Jannuzi, Deputy Executive Director of Amnesty International USA. \\"Solutions for ending human rights violations, not excuses, must be found.\\" ===Feinstein–Lee Amendment=== The NDAA, an otherwise mundane annual bill that lays out the use of funds for the Department of Defense, has come under attack during the Obama administration for the introduction of a provision in 2012 that allows the military to detain United States citizens indefinitely without charge or trial for mere suspicions of ties to terrorism. Under the 2012 NDAA's Sec. 1021, U.S. President Obama did not agree to give the military the power to arrest and hold Americans without the writ of habeas corpus as he promised with that year's signing statement that his administration would not abuse that privilege. On December 4, 2012, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed the bill 98–0 and added in Section 1033 the Feinstein–Lee NDAA Amendment which states: \\"An authorization to use military force, a declaration of war, or any similar authority shall not authorize the detention without charge or trial of a citizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States apprehended in the United States, unless an Act of Congress expressly authorizes such detention.\\" Civil liberties group are concerned with this amendment because they think anyone on American soil should be given a trial if accused of a crime, given that the U.S. Constitution protects \\"persons,\\" rather than \\"citizens.\\" The Feinstein–Lee Amendment is \\"inconsistent with the constitutional principle that basic due process applies to everyone in the US,\\" said American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) legislative counsel Chris Anders. Anders was also worried that the amendment could be construed to actually imply that the U.S. government has the constitutional authority for indefinite detention without charge and trial. \\"Moreover, we are very concerned that the Feinstein amendment implicitly authorizes domestic military detention. By seeking to protect only United States citizens and legal permanent residents, the amendment could be read to imply that indefinite military detention of any other persons apprehended within the United States was authorized in 2001 and was lawful,\\" the ACLU wrote, referring to the Authorization for Use of Military Force, the founding document of the \\"war on terror\\" that was passed the week after the September 11 attacks. \\"In addition, the clause 'unless an Act of Congress expressly authorizes such detention' could be read to imply that there are no constitutional obstacles to Congress enacting a statute that would authorize the domestic military detention of any person in the United States,\\" the ACLU wrote. A Congressional conference committee tasked with merging the House and Senate versions of the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) decided on December 18, 2012 to drop the Feinstein–Lee provision, which would have explicitly barred the military from holding American citizens and permanent residents in indefinite detention without trial as terrorism suspects. There was no reason given for this. Instead, the following replacement provivison was added: The Huffington Post noted that the replacement version appeared to do little, because the Supreme Court has already declared that the writ of habeas corpus, i.e. the constitutional requirement that someone be presented to a judge, applies to all people. This was echoed from the civil liberties groups. \\"This language doesn't do anything of substance,\\" said Raha Wala, a lawyer in the law and national security program of Human Rights First. \\"It doesn't ban indefinite detention within the United States or change anything about existing law.\\" Chris Anders from the American Civil Liberties Union called the language on indefinite detention of Americans \\"completely meaningless\\" and added there's no doubt that habeas rights are available to anyone who's detained in the U.S. Bruce Afran, a lawyer for the group of journalists and activists suing the U.S. government over the 2012 NDAA, explained that the above quoted provision gives U.S. citizens a right to go to civilian (i.e. Article III) court based on \\"any [applicable] constitutional rights,\\" but since there are no rules in place to exercise this right, detained U.S. citizens currently have no way to gain access to lawyers, family or the court itself once they are detained within the military. Afran added that the new statute actually states that persons lawfully in the U.S. can be detained under the Authorization for the Use of Military Force [AUMF], while the original statute from the 2012 NDAA which he is fighting never went that far. Afran concluded: \\"Therefore, under the guise of supposedly adding protection to Americans, the new statute actually expands the AUMF to civilians in the U.S.\\" ===Smith–Mundt Modernization Act of 2012=== The Smith–Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 was introduced by U.S. Congressman Mac Thornberry on May 10, 2012 in the House of Representatives. U.S. Congressman Adam Smith was a Co-Sponsor. The bill purpose is \\"to authorize the domestic dissemination of information and material about the United States intended primarily for foreign audiences\\" The act was added to the 2013 NDAA bill as section of 1078 to amend certain passages of Smith–Mundt Act of 1948 and Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987. The Smith–Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 passed Congress as part of the NDAA 2013 on December 28, 2012. Amendments made to the Smith–Mundt Act of 1948 and Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987 allow for materials produced by the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) to be released within US borders.See National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (section 1078 (a)) at the GovTrack.us entry Text of H.R. 4310 (112th): National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Passed Congress/Enrolled Bill version) U.S. Congressman Adam Smith stated with the respect to the bill's purpose that al-Qaeda was infiltrating the Internet in order to promote anti-Americanism and that with passage of the Smith–Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 the U.S. government would be able disseminate public diplomacy information by the State Department to counter that in the Arabic language abroad. Several news outlets reported that the 2013 NDAA overturned a 64-year ban on the domestic dissemination of propaganda (described as \\"public diplomacy information\\") produced for foreign audiences, effectively eliminating the distinction between foreign and domestic audiences. The news website BuzzFeed News for example quoted an unnamed source saying the Smith–Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 would allow \\"U.S. propaganda intended to influence foreign audiences to be used on the domestic population.\\" The Media and Outreach Coordinator for the U.S. State Department's Bureau of African Affairs, Gregory L. Garland, noted that the United States shoots itself in the foot by the release prohibition of materials produced by the State Department and the BBG within US borders and by preaching freedom of the press abroad while practicing censorship at home. He argued against a complete repeal of the Smith–Mundt Act of 1948 stating that the law \\"creates a statutory firewall between resources intended for foreign audiences and those used domestically. Tear down that firewall, and it will be a matter of time before resources and personnel who focus on talking about America overseas are diverted in favor of domestic \\"public affairs,\\" the short-term political imperative of any administration.\\" An unnamed Pentagon official who was concerned about the 2012 law version stated: \\"It removes the protection for Americans. It removes oversight from the people who want to put out this information. There are no checks and balances. No one knows if the information is accurate, partially accurate, or entirely false.\\" The monthly magazine The Atlantic echoed those concerns by pointing out to two USA Today journalists who became target of a smear and propaganda campaign after they reported that the U.S. military \\"information operations\\" program spent millions of U.S. dollars in marketing campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq criticized as ineffective and poorly monitored. As it turned out one of firm leaders who executed the marketing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan admitted to be a part of the smear and propaganda campaign against the USA Today reporters. While there are concerns, as described above, there may also be advantages to repealing the release prohibition of materials produced by the State Department and the BBG within U.S. borders. Garland, for example, wrote that the provision banning domestic dissemination in a communication age with no frontiers deprives the United States of its \\"most powerful tool of soft power: our ideals.\\" ==See also== *National Defense Authorization Act *National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 *National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 == References == Category:2012 controversies Category:2013 controversies Category:Acts of the 112th United States Congress Category:Civil liberties in the United States Category:Human rights in the United States Category:Obama administration controversies Category:U.S. National Defense Authorization Acts ","title":"National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013"},{"id":"35892659","text":"Masks (German: Masken) is a 1929 German silent crime film directed by Rudolf Meinert and starring Karl Ludwig Diehl, Trude Berliner and Marcella Albani.

Supporting herself by teaching at a school for handicapped children, she wrote a book on art teaching illustrated by her pupils, and then became a teacher-training lecturer at Goldsmiths College. When Goldsmiths was evacuated to Nottingham during World War II, she created the Midlands Group of Artists: two exhibitions in a large empty building led to permanent gallery premises and a range of other activities supporting artists in the region. The Midlands Group of Artists painted murals at five locations throughout the region but none were thought to have survived. In 2013, workmen rewiring St. Martins Church in Bilborough, Nottingham uncovered two of Gibbs's murals, which had thought to have been destroyed in the 1970s. These murals are now to be restored and put on public display. In 1943 Gibbs submitted three works to the War Artists' Advisory Committee. These were purchased and led to her being commissioned to make a series of drawings concerning blood transfusion stations. A further commission on the work of the Women's Voluntary Service, (WVS), resulted in the painting WVS Clothing Exchange (1943). Remaining in Nottingham after the war, she married Hugh Willat, later Secretary-General of the Arts Council. She continued drawing and painting until a stroke seven years before she died. ==Archive== In 2000, Aberystwyth University purchased a collection comprising 98 prints, drawings and watercolours from throughout her career from her husband's estate.

K. Rema, Chandrasekharan's wife said she was not fully satisfied with the verdict, yet it had exposed the role of the CPI(M) in Kozhikode and Kannur districts hatching a plot to kill her husband.

The murder was widely covered for at least a month on the Kerala media and brought out significant tremors in the CPI(M). V. S. Achuthanandan demanded immediate changes in the state leadership and to constitute an ad hoc committee, failing which would result him relinquishing his position as leader of the opposition in the state assembly. Pinarayi Vijayan, a leader of CPI(M), remarked that traitors are always traitors, an indirect reference to Chandrasekharan's exit from the party back in 2008. The comment came few days after Chandrasekharan's murder. A memorial erected by RMP members in remembrance of Chandrasekharan's murder have been reportedly been attacked constantly by CPI(M) members and consequently had to be rebuilt five times. ==References== Category:1960 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Indian Marxists Category:Deaths by blade weapons Category:Assassinated Indian politicians Category:People from Kozhikode district ","title":"T.

She had three hits on the UK Singles Chart with \\"Up on the Roof\\", \\"Count on Me\\" (both 1963) and \\"Come to Me\\" (1964). She also recorded a cover version of \\"Every Day I Have to Cry\\" (1964). Grant was a contemporary of Petula Clark and Cilla Black, and Allmusic journalist, Richie Unterberger, noted \\"she had a strong, versatile voice\\" but was hindered by \\"her inability to carve out a recognizable stylistic niche\\". ==Early life== Julie Grant was born Vivien Foreman in Blackpool, Lancashire, England. When Grant was aged 16 months her family – besides her parents she had an older brother and sister – relocated to Cape Town where at age four Grant won a local talent contest: her prize was the opportunity to perform a concert with a local orchestra who invited Grant to sing with them regularly over a period of some two years. Grant subsequently lived with her family for brief periods in Johannesburg and Victoria Falls, then returning with her family to England, first living in London where Grant attended the Italia Conte music conservatory and at age 9 appeared onstage at the Drury Lane Theatre in The King and I. Grant then moved with her family to Leeds, where Grant trained in dance and opera, vocalising with a local orchestra on weekends. ==Recording career== At age 15 Grant was discovered by Frankie Vaughan and signed by Vaughan's agent Eric Easton who arranged for Grant to audition for Pye Records. Pye signed Grant who was still known as Vivien Foreman: as the label requested she adopt a stage name Grant formed \\"Julie Grant\\" from the name of her father's accountant Julian Grant. The debut single by Julie Grant, \\"Somebody Tell Him\\", was released in March 1962 and was the first of fifteen singles all produced by Tony Hatch the fourth of which, a cover of The Drifters' US hit, \\"Up on the Roof\\", gave Grant her chart debut. Despite being beaten by a rival UK cover by Kenny Lynch, which reached No. 5 compared to the No. 33 peak of Grant's version, Grant was able to use the relative success of \\"Up on the Roof\\" to gain a series of television guest spots, plus star billing on a package tour which also featured The Rolling Stones, The Everly Brothers and Bo Diddley. Grant's profile was maintained by her follow-up single, the March 1963 release \\"Count on Me\\", which became her best chart placing in the UK at No. 24. After five intervening single releases Grant was afforded a third and final UK chart hit with the August 1964 release \\"Come to Me\\", an orchestral ballad (as opposed to Grant's earlier Merseybeat-style hits) which reached No. 31. Grant had no further single releases until January 1965. It has been alleged that Grant turned down the opportunity to record the Tony Hatch composition, \\"Downtown\\", recorded by Petula Clark on 16 October 1964 to become an international hit. However, Hatch has said that he only completed the lyrics of \\"Downtown\\" after Clark had heard the melody and asked to record it, and also said that prior to Clark's involvement he had thought to place the song with the Drifters: \\"it never occurred to me [originally] that a white woman could even sing it.\\"Lavin, Christine (2010). Cold Pizza For Breakfast: a mem-wha?? New Haven, Connecticut: Tell Me Press. p.218 From January 1965 Pye issued four singles by Grant with the fourth: \\"Stop\\" released 17 September 1965, bringing Grant's Pye Records tenure to a close. Tony Hatch would later recall: \\"I thought Julie Grant was great and I’m sorry I never managed to help her achieve her full potential. No doubt I was producing too many artistes at this time, especially girls. In those years, in-house producers often faced this problem and I could never give her the attention she deserved.\\" ==Later career and life== In 1967, Grant's manager suggested that she join the Zaras, a Spanish-based lounge act who, prior to Grant's recruitment, comprised the Zaratiegui family: four brothers and two sisters from Tafalla. Grant first toured Europe with the Zaras under the aegis of the USO: in 1969 the Zaras accepted an offer for a three-month engagement in the United States where subsequent engagements resulted in the group's members including Grant making Las Vegas their home base from 1970, which year Grant married Marino Zaratiegui of the Zaras with whom she has a daughter. Until 1975 Grant performed as female lead for the Zaras throughout the Caribbean, Canada, and the US, playing casinos, resorts and cruise ships. From 1975 Grant performed as a solo act at the behest of David Connelly the road manager for the Carpenters whom Grant had met while performing in Toronto with the Zaras: Grant and Connelly formed a personal relationship – eventually marrying – and also a professional one as Connelly became Grant's manager. A 1988 article which described Grant as \\"performing on the Las Vegas/Atlantic City resort circuit since the late 1970s\\" quoted her as saying: \\"Until last year, I was on the road fifty weeks a year. But I was to the point where I said: 'It's time for myself and my family'\\" (Grant was also described as \\"the mother of three teen-agers\\"). In 1994, Grant retired from performing to work as a booking agent and she, and her husband, are still running their own talent agency. Grant, who was featured on recordings by the Zaras, also recorded in 1985 for Estate Records, a label headed by Paul Leka. In 2010, Grant self-released a live album that had been recorded at the Hilton Hotel in Springfield, Virginia, in 1978. She currently lives in Gilford, New Hampshire. ==DiscographyChart singles=== {  - ! Year ! Title Songwriters !

Upon investigating the possibility of going solar, Schoolman found the problems of building code, financial and contracting issues too complex to be solved by a single person, so Schoolman, Musser and their two sons formed the Mount Pleasant Solar Cooperative to bring greater time, expertise, lobbying and buying power to the problem. In 2009 45 houses in Mount Pleasant went solar. Since then that number has grown to about 250. Soon a Capitol Hill Solar Co-op was calling seeking Mount Pleasant's expertise. Eventually there were solar coops in every ward in the District. In 2010 the eleven neighborhood solar coops of Washington, DC formed an umbrella organization, DC Solar United Neighborhoods (DC SUN). The SUN model has begun spreading to additional states, including Maryland and Virginia. In 2011, Schoolman founded the Solar United Neighbors (then called Community Power Network), a nonprofit organization bringing together the efforts of local renewable energy groups. As of May 2019, Solar United Neighbors is active in 12 U.S States. Anya Schoolman and the Mount Pleasant Solar Cooperative were the subject of a segment in M. Sanjayan's Discovery Channel series, Powering The Future (the segment on the Mount Pleasant Solar Cooperative is at 10:30-19:50) and have been recognized by the White House's Champions of Change program. ==Availability== Insolation is good at about 4.7 sun hours/day.Sterling, Virginia ==Installed capacity== {  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" ! colspan=\\"4\\" style=\\"background-color: #cfb;\\"  Grid-Connected PV Capacity (MW) - ! style=\\"background-color: #cfb;\\" Year ! style=\\"background-color: #cfb;\\" Capacity ! style=\\"background-color: #cfb;\\" Installed ! style=\\"background-color: #cfb;\\" % Change -  2007  0.5   -  2008  0.7  0.2  40% -  2009  1.0  0.3  43% -  2010  4.5  3.5  350% -  2011  11.6  7.2  158% -  2012  13.9  2.3  20% -  2013  16.5  2.6  19% -  2014  19.5  3  -  2015  27  7.5  -  2016  43.5  16.5  -  2017  59  15.5  -  2018  83.3  24.3  -  2019  90.8  17.5  } ==See also== *Solar power in the United States *Renewable energy in the United States ==References *Solar United Neighbors of D.C. *American Solar Energy Society *Incentives and Policies *DC Solar Map by Mapdwell *Solar Permitting Guidelines from DCRA Category:Solar power in the United States Category:Energy in Washington, D.C.

Krampf has been described as a \\"phantom of film history\\"Bergfelder & Cargnelli p.78 because of his largely forgotten role working on a number of important films during the silent and early sound era. Only two of Krampf's films The Student of Prague (1926) and The Ghoul (1933) were expressionist, as he generally used a naturalistic style.Bergfelder & Cargnelli p.79-80 ==Germany== Krampf first worked as a cinematographer in 1920. During the following decade Krampf worked alongside a number of the leading directors of the Weimar era including F. W. Murnau, Robert Wiene, G. W. Pabst, Richard Oswald and Rudolf Meinert at a time when German films enjoyed a high critical reputation. ==Britain== Krampf moved to Britain to work in 1931. Krampf made six films for Gaumont British, a leading studio, between 1932 and 1936. He returned to Germany in 1935 to work on the historical epic Joan of Arc. An agreement Krampf had with an Austrian company to work on Mausi (which was ultimately never made), was broken by the studio because of pressure from Nazi Germany possibly because Krampf might have been of Jewish heritage.Bergfelder & Cargnelli p.82 Krampf successfully sued in court, and returned to Britain, where he lived for the remainder of his career. After leaving Gaumont, Krampf worked mainly at Welwyn Studios. During the Second World War Krampf collaborated with Alfred Hitchcock on two Propaganda films Aventure malgache and Bon Voyage. His final film of note was Fame is the Spur, a thinly disguised biopic of the politician Ramsay MacDonald, by the Boulting brothers. ==Selected filmography== * The Legend of Holy Simplicity (1920) * The Maharaja's Favourite Wife (1921) * Nosferatu (1922) * On the Red Cliff (1922) * The Lost Shoe (1923) * One Glass of Water (1923) * The Hands of Orlac (1924) * Boarding House Groonen (1925) * The Girl with a Patron (1925) * The Adventure of Mr. Philip Collins (1925) * The Student of Prague (1926) * Out of the Mist (1927) * A Murderous Girl (1927) * The Girl with the Five Zeros (1927) * Grand Hotel (1927) * The Prince of Rogues (1928) * Pandora's Box (1929) * Masks (1929) * The Veil Dancer (1929) * Vendetta (1929) * The Last Company (1930) * Alraune (1930) * Cyanide (1930) * The Bells (1931) * The Virtuous Sinner (1931) * Queen of the Night (1931) * The Song of the Nations (1931) * The Outsider (1931) * The Lucky Number (1932) * Kuhle Wampe (1932) * Rome Express (1932) * The First Mrs. Fraser (1932) * Sleeping Car (1933) * The Ghoul (1933) *Little Stranger (1934) * Death at Broadcasting House (1934) * Joan of Arc (1935) * The Tunnel (1935) * Everything Is Thunder (1936) * The Amateur Gentleman (1936) * His Lordship (1936) * Paradise for Two (1937) * Marigold (1938) * On the Night of the Fire (1939) * The Outsider (1939) * Convoy (1940) * Dead Man's Shoes (1940) * The Black Sheep of Whitehall (1942) * The Night Has Eyes (1942) * Suspected Person (1942) * Warn That Man (1943) * Latin Quarter (1945) * Fame is the Spur (1947) * This Was a Woman (1948) * Portrait of Clare (1950) * The Franchise Affair (1951) ==ReferencesBibliography== * Bergfelder, Tim & Cargnelli, Christian.

The period also found the country discover its petroleum deposits, which has had a major effect on the economy of Venezuela ==Juan Vicente Gómez (1908 - 1935)== In 1908, President Cipriano Castro was too sick to be cured in Venezuela and he left for Germany leaving Juan Vicente Gómez in charge. Castro had not gone further than the outer Antilles when Gómez took over the government and forbade Castro from returning. This was the beginning of a regime that lasted until 1935 and is interwoven with the early development of the oil industry, the greatest influence ever on the history of Venezuela. One of Gómez's first measures was to start canceling outstanding Venezuelan international debts, a goal which was soon achieved. Under Gómez, Venezuela acquired all the appurtenances of a regular national army staffed and officered almost entirely by Andeans.Ziems, Angel, El gomecismo y la formación del ejército nacional, 1979 At the time, the country had a widespread telegraphic system. Under these circumstances, the possibility of caudillo uprisings was curtailed. The only armed threat against Gómez came from a disaffected former business partner to whom he had given a monopoly on all maritime and riverine commerce. Although there are many tales of Gómez's cruelty and ruthlessness, they are mostly exaggerations by his enemies. The man who had tried to overthrow him, Román Delgado Chalbaud, spent fourteen years in jail. He later claimed that he was in ball and chains during all that time, but he was released by Gómez. His son, Carlos Delgado Chalbaud, would later become president of Venezuela. When university students staged a street demonstration in 1928 (Generation of 1928), they were arrested but were soon released. But Gómez was indeed ruthless in throttling all opposition and he allowed a personality cult, but this was as much his doing as that of his sycophants, who were numerous all over Venezuela.Rourke, Thomas (pseud.), Gomez, Tyrant of the Andes, 1936 Gómez, unlike Guzmán Blanco, never erected a statue of himself anywhere in Venezuela. He was a stickler for legal formalisms, which in essence meant that he introduced new constitutions any time it suited his political ends, although this was also the rule during the 19th century. During his dictatorship, Gómez appointed two figurehead presidents while he kept a tight hold on the armed forces from Maracay, his favorite city, west of Caracas, which he embellished and made the main Venezuelan garrison, a status which it retained until at least the 1960s. ===The discovery of oil=== It did not take much geological expertise to know that Venezuela had large petroleum deposits, because the petroleum oozed out from seeps all over the country and an asphalt lake had formed naturally. Venezuelans themselves had tried to extract oil for a small hand-pumped refinery early in the 20th century. When word spread internationally of Venezuela's oil potential, representatives of large foreign companies came to the country and started lobbying for rights of exploration and exploitation, and Gómez established the concessionary system. Venezuela had inherited from Spain the law that the ground surface—presumably, as deep as a plow or a water well went—could belong to individuals but everything under the soil was state property. Thus, Gómez began to grant huge concessions to family and friends. Any one who was close to Gómez eventually would become rich in one way or another. Gómez himself accumulated immense expanses of grasslands for cattle- raising, which had been his original occupation and was a lifelong passion. The Venezuelan concessionaires leased or sold their holdings to the highest foreign bidders. Gómez, who didn't trust industrial workers or unions, refused to allow the oil companies to build refineries on Venezuelan soil, so these were built them in the Dutch islands of Aruba and Curaçao. The one in Aruba was for a time the second largest in the world, after the one in Abadan, Iran. Although the Venezuelan oil boom started around 1918, the year when oil first figured as an export commodity, it took off when an oil well called Barroso blew a spout that threw up an average of the equivalent to 100,000 barrels a day. It took five days to bring the flow under control.Lagoven, Venezuela and the Oil Pioneers, 1988 By 1927, oil was Venezuela's most valuable export and by 1929 Venezuela exported more oil than any other country in the world. It has been said that Gómez did not tax the oil companies and that Venezuela did not benefit from oil production, but this is only a half-truth.McBeth, B. S., Gomez and the Oil Companies in Venezuela, 1908-1935, 1983 The Venezuelan government derived considerable income from the concessions and from taxes of one sort of another, but the original fiscal laws which applied to the oil companies were hammered out between the government and American lawyers. The laws were relatively lenient, but Gómez, who had an acute business sense, understood that it was necessary to create incentives for investors in the Venezuelan oil fields, some of which were very accessible but others were deep in jungles. Oil income allowed Gómez to expand Venezuela's rudimentary infrastructure and the overall impact of the oil industry on Venezuela was a modernizing trend in the areas where it operated. But in a wider sense, the Venezuelan people, except for those who worked for the oil companies and lived badly but had a steady income, benefited little or not all from the country's oil riches. Gómez took power in a very poor illiterate country. The white/pardos social divide was still very much in place. When Gómez died in his bed in 1935, Venezuela was still a poor illiterate country and if anything the social stratification had been accentuated. The population had grown from perhaps one million and a half to two million. Malaria was the greatest killer. Gómez himself probably had Amerindian ancestry, but he was overtly racist and he was much influenced by a historian, Laureano Vallenilla Lanz, who published a book claiming not inaccurately that the Venezuelan War of Independence was really a civil war with the dubious added argument that pardos were a menace to public order and Venezuela could only subsist as a nation ruled by white strongmen.Vallenilla Lanz, Laureano Cesarismo democratico, 1920 Gómez, for instance, prohibited all immigration from black Caribbean islands. Even though Venezuela's population in his time was 80% pardo, passports, which were first issued under Gómez, identified carriers by the color of skin, which they still did until the 1980s. Venezuela did change considerably under Gómez. It had radio stations in all the important cities. There existed an incipient middle class. But it still had only two or three universities. An estimated 90% of families formed through common-law marriages. The social progress that did take place was through a spontaneous trend towards modernization in which oil played the central role. ==López Contreras and Medina Angarita (1935 - 1945)== Gómez's minister of war, Eleazar López Contreras, succeeded him: a tall, thin, disciplined soldier with a solid education. Before arriving at his post, he served the Gomecista government loyally wherever he was sent, including at one time Venezuela's eastern land's end, a village called Cristobal Colón, across from Trinidad. In power, López Contreras allowed the pardo masses to vent for a few days before clamping down. He had Gómez's properties confiscated by the state, but the dictator's relatives, with some exceptions who left the country, were not harassed. Gómez never married but he had various illegitimate children. Initially, López Contreras permitted political parties to come into the open, but they tended to become rambunctious and he proscribed them, although he did not use strong repressive means (which weren't necessary anyway) as the politicians that led them, called in Venezuelan historiography the \\"1928 Generation\\", did not yet have large popular followings. One of the reasons for this hard stance was that, during his first year as president, López Contreras was faced with a labor strike which paralyzed the oil industry in Zulia state in western Venezuela, whose capital was Maracaibo, where the most productive fields were located. López Contreras had created a labor ministry and his representative there, Carlos Ramírez MacGregor, received orders to make a report of the situation, which confirmed the workers’ grievances. He also had instructions to declare the strike illegal, (which he did). Government forces made the workers return to their jobs, although after that incident the oil companies did start taking serious initiatives to improve conditions for Venezuelan workers. Among the notable goals of López Contreras was a campaign to eradicate malaria in the llanos. This task was finally accomplished during the following presidency through the use of DDT. Two communists led the oil strike: Rodolfo Quintero and the oil worker Jesús Faría. The history of Marxism in Venezuela is rather complex, but a brief overview is that communism never sunk roots in Venezuela and its impact on mainstream politics was minimal. López Contreras tried to create a political movement called Cruzadas Cívicas Bolivarianas (Civic Bolivarian Crusades), but it did not pan out, for whatever he did had the taint of his background as a pillar of the Gómez regime. Even the name \\"crusades\\" was suspect with its clerical overtones.López Contreras, Eleazar, Temas de historia bolivariana, 1954 Constitutionally, López Contreras finished Gómez's last term and in 1936 he was elected by the docile congress for the term ending in 1941. After a vote in the same congress for the 1941-1946 term, López Contreras handed power to his war minister and personal friend, the Andean general Isaías Medina Angarita, who in many ways made a strong foil to his predecessor. He was stout and good natured and did not make excessive demands on himself. Medina Angarita legalized all political parties, including the divided communists: some were hard-line, such as the Machado brothers of a traditional Caracas family; and others, gradualists or conciliatory, led by Luis Miquilena, a union leader who supported Medina's step-by-step approach and for a time was allied to one of the Machado brothers. Under Medina there was an indirect democracy, which followed the 19th century custom of elections at the municipal council level. But Medina was committed to a still restricted but wider national democratic election. For that he had officialdom in all the Venezuelan states form a pro-government party named Partido Democratico Venezolana or PDV (Venezuelan Democratic Party). But the real genius at political organization was Rómulo Betancourt, who created from the bottom up what was in effect a pardo party with a strongly reformist, but not Marxist, agenda. ==El Trienio Adeco (1945 - 1948)== Rómulo Betancourt El Trienio Adeco was a three-year period in Venezuelan history, from 1945 to 1948, under the government of the popular party Democratic Action (Accion Democratica, its adherents adecos). The party gained office via the 1945 Venezuelan coup d'état against President Isaías Medina Angarita, and held the first democratic elections in Venezuelan history. The 1947 Venezuelan general election saw Democratic Action formally elected to office, but it was removed from office shortly after in the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état. There was no particular incident that set off the bloodless 1948 coup, which was led by Delgado Chalbaud. There was no popular opposition. This might have meant that the odds were too great or that the pardo masses had not noticed any particular improvement in their lives despite the incessant government propaganda. All prominent adecos were expelled. The other parties were allowed but muzzled. ==1948 - 1958== Venezuela saw ten years of military dictatorship from 1948 to 1958. After the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état brought an end a three-year experiment in democracy (\\"El Trienio Adeco\\"), a triumvirate of military personnel controlled the government until 1952, when it held presidential elections. These were free enough to produce results unacceptable to the government, leading them to be falsified, and to one of the three leaders, Marcos Pérez Jiménez, assuming the Presidency. His government was brought to an end by the 1958 Venezuelan coup d'état which saw the advent of democracy. ==References== Category:History of Venezuela by period Category:20th century in Venezuela ","title":"History of Venezuela (1908–1958)"},{"id":"35893136","text":" The Bushcaddy L-164 is a Canadian kit aircraft that was designed by Sean Gilmore and produced by Canadian Light Aircraft Sales and Service and most recently by Bushcaddy.

It was created by Wil Wheaton and Felicia Day and was hosted by Wheaton. TableTop was published on Felicia Day's YouTube channel, Geek & Sundry. In each episode, following a brief explanation of one or more tabletop games, Wheaton plays the games with one or more guests—usually web or TV personalities. A wide range of hobby gaming titles have been played, from classic German-style board games and family games to RPGs and card games. It has been described as \\"…like Celebrity Poker meets Dinner for Five, where interesting people got together for tabletop games.\\" After two seasons, the show announced that its third season would be crowdfunded via Indiegogo, and was the most successful digital series campaign on that site until Con Man broke its record in March 2015.Season 2 announcement: ==EpisodesSeason 1 (2012-13)=Season 2 (2013-14)=Season 3 (2014-15)=Season 4 (2016-17)=== On December 31, 2015, Wil Wheaton announced the fourth season of Tabletop would begin production in April 2016. Wheaton estimated early June 2016 for the release of the first episode but did not provide a firm release date. After filming ended in May 2016, Wheaton revised the estimated release to July 2016, but mentioned that he actually has no say over the release date. The list of games was released April 22, 2016 but not the final order or release dates. On July 28, 2016, Wheaton announced that release of season 4 was delayed, saying \\"Legendary has decided to delay the release of season four until later this year. As soon as we know exactly when it is, I'll make a big old announcement.\\" On October 15, 2016, it was announced on Twitter that Season 4 of TableTop would premiere on November 2, with the first two episodes released on both YouTube and Legendary Digital Networks' subscription streaming service, Alpha, and the rest of the season initially only on Alpha but to be released on YouTube in early 2017. A Reddit comment made by Wheaton on January 13 stated that episodes should be released publicly on YouTube starting the week of January 30. Geek and Sundry announced via their Facebook page on January 31 that episodes would begin streaming on YouTube the next day, February 1. ==Funding campaign== On April 5, 2014, Wil Wheaton announced the launch of a campaign on Indiegogo to fund the creation of a third season. The target amount was $500,000 to produce 15 episodes, with additional targets of $750,000 to produce a full season of 20 episodes, and $1,000,000 to film a spin-off RPG series. The campaign exceeded its goals, eventually closing with $1,414,159. ==Impact== Evidence presented by a Canadian online game retailer showed that games featured in TableTop received a boost in sales after the episode aired: this was dubbed \\"The Wheaton Effect\\". Game publisher Days of Wonder has said that having titles featured on the show had significant boost on sales. After the game Tsuro was featured, demand was so high that the publisher exhausted all stock reserves. The game was, for a time, unavailable in Europe as production tried to cope with US demand. In 2013, the web series won the Diana Jones Award, citing that 'Tabletop has brought a new energy and humour to the board-game field: its blend of good humour and gameplay is pitch-perfect and has introduced a range of titles from modern classics to indie RPGs to thousands of new players.'. TableTop won the gold ENnie for Best Podcast at the 2013 Gen Con EN World RPG Awards for its Dragon Age episodes. The award was accepted by Chris Pramas on behalf of Wil Wheaton.

In addition to the full July 16 concert, the DVD also includes \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\", from the previous night on July 15 (the song was not performed on July 16 due to a late start of the show) and \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\", and \\"Bad\\", performed on September 26, 1987, in Yokohama, Japan. The Bad 25 deluxe package also contains a CD of the audio from the July 16 concert as well, with audio edited down to 80 minutes from the original 2 hours. ==Audio/video controversy== According to the official Bad 25 statement released by the Estate of Michael Jackson, the video is sourced from Jackson's personal VHS copy of the show, the only known copy in existence. The audio, however, has been sourced by a high-quality multitrack recording, snippets of which have leaked online in mid-2011 to positive fan reception; some of this is from the preceding concert on July 15. Both the July 15 and 16 concerts are the only known multitrack audio recordings of the Bad tour. Some fans have taken concern over the video quality of the DVD, after a portion of Jackson's performance of \\"Bad\\" from the DVD was shown on ITV. On May 31, 2012, co-heads of Jackson's estate, John McClain and John Branca, released an official statement regarding the quality concerns. It was revealed that, due to poor storage and possible carelessness, dozens of U-matic performance masters (including those from Wembley) could not be located, confirming that Jackson's VHS copy is the only known copy of the concert. McClain and Branca also revealed that multiple U-matic masters of other performances from the tour did exist, but were unusable. One of the few usable master recordings the Estate possesses from the Bad tour was the performance in Yokohama, Japan in 1987. However, the Estate opted not to release this, as they considered it to be nothing more than a modified version of the Victory Tour with three extra songs. This concert also aired on Japanese television. As a result, the Estate stated that a video enhancement lab was hired to restore the VHS copy of Wembley. ==Critical reception== Critical reception on the concert itself has mostly been positive. Chaz Lipp described the concert as \\"simply incredible from start to finish.\\" There has still been a mixed reaction among some fans with regard to the quality of the video. Some felt that the original U-matic video elements should have been located before the release was authorized. Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times criticized the audio mix \\"It's a solid, if thinly recorded, document that lacks sonic heft. The rhythm section sounds a mile away, and lacks the pop of a well-recorded concert\\". Michael Jones of Blog Critics had this to say \\"These two recordings just exude pure energy and while watching it I’m thunderstruck by how effortless this lithe little man seems to make spending over two hours singing and dancing his absolute heart out for thousands of adoring fans. (I get tired just lip- syncing and trying to do the occasional move with just my arms, while watching.)\\" The Second Disc had a glowing review of the Wembley DVD saying \\"The picture quality is clearly that of a videocassette, but it doesn’t detract from a stunning performance, and the camera work is generally strong with well-chosen angles. Within moments of opening with “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’,” Jackson is posing, gyrating, spinning, kicking, stomping and slithering with a sleek fleetness of foot that whips the audience into a frenzied state. He’s both graceful and sexually charged, and he is the production.While the singer appears to be lip-synching to a handful of the songs, his performance is, largely, overwhelming and frequently playful. The remarkably well-sequenced concert shows Jackson as an utterly comfortable presence, smiling and taking the stage with ease. There’s very little patter as he prefers to concentrate on his angular, Bob Fosse-in-the-future choreographic moves and unstoppable anthems. By the time he dons his famous glove and launches into that mesmerizing moonwalk on “Billie Jean,” it seems that Jackson can’t possibly give any more. But he does, dancing with a chorus line of kids in the closing “Bad” and literally dropping to the floor for the encore of “Man in the Mirror.” \\" Evan Sawdey of PopMatters gave a positive review of the DVD giving it a 7 out of 10 saying \\" Here, Jackson is at the peak of his powers, absolutely bursting with energy. Extended dance breaks are added into the songs, his backing quartet of dancers are extremely precise, and yes, that’s 80s Sheryl Crow coming out to duet with him on “I Just Can’t Stop Loving You...Yet the show is remarkably fun, and relatively fast-paced. There are multiple costume changes throughout, with Jackson wearing whatever jacket is appropriate for the song he’s singing (a letterman jacket for “Thriller”, a white coat and fedora for “Smooth Criminal”, that signature black leather for “Bad”). At first, he and his dancers could not be tighter. They exude energy, and perhaps what’s most remarkable is how Jackson is able to still sing/sustain notes while doing his numerous laser-precise moves. By the time he starts Moonwalking during “Billie Jean” (and let there be no mistake: this is as spectacular and smooth as he has ever executed the move), the already-nuts crowd simply goes into overdrive\\" Chaz Lipp of The Morton Report had this to say about Jackson's performance \\"Perhaps the best part of Bad 25 is the full concert recorded live at London’s Wembley Stadium, July 16, 1988. This is simply prime Michael Jackson. He’s in fantastic voice throughout, always in control of his instrument—even during the most delicate moments, such as “She’s Out of My Life.” I’d list some highlights, but at the risk of sounding hyperbolic, the whole thing functions as a highlight. This concert is relatively stripped down visually, making it a perfect contrast to the more elaborately produced Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour DVD. Jackson’s dancing is as mesmerizing as ever, on full display during tunes such as “Smooth Criminal” and, of course, “Billie Jean.” ==Track listing== * \\"Bad Groove (The Band Jam Section)\\" contains the following pieces: ** \\"Band Jam\\" (composed by Greg Phillinganes) ** \\"Layla\\" (composed by Eric Clapton and Jim Gordon) ** \\"Sussudio\\" (composed by Phil Collins) ** \\"You Win Again\\" (composed by Barry Gibb, Maurice Gibb and Robin Gibb) ** \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\" (composed by Michael Jackson) ==Personnel== ;Performers * Michael Jackson – lead vocals, dance and choreographer * LaVelle Smith – backup dancer * Evaldo Garcia – backup dancer * Randy Allaire – backup dancer * Dominic Lucero – backup dancer ;Musicians * Greg Phillinganes – keyboards, synthesizer, musical director * Rory Kaplan – keyboards, synthesizers * Christopher Currell – Synclavier synthesizer, digital guitar, sound effects * Ricky Lawson – drums, percussion * Jennifer Batten – lead guitar, rhythm guitar * Jon Clark – lead and rhythm guitar * Don Boyette – bass guitar, synth bass * Darryl Phinnessee – backing vocals * Dorian Holley – backing vocals * Sheryl Crow – backing vocals * Kevin Dorsey – vocal director, backing vocals ==Charts== {class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" !scope=\\"col\\"Chart (2012) !scope=\\"col\\"Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\"Argentinian Music DVDs ChartSelect Ranking Mensual de DVD under the first drop-down menu and 01/09/2012 on the second menu. 2 - !scope=\\"row\\"Australian Music DVDs Chart 2 - !scope=\\"row\\"Austrian Music DVDs Chart 1 - !scope=\\"row\\"Belgian (Flanders) Music DVDs Chart 1 - !scope=\\"row\\"Belgian (Wallonia) Music DVDs Chart 1 - !scope=\\"row\\"Danish Music DVDs Chart 5 - !scope=\\"row\\"Dutch Music DVDs Chart 1 - !scope=\\"row\\"German Albums Chart 64 - !scope=\\"row\\"Italian Music DVDs Chart 1 - !scope=\\"row\\"Norwegian Music DVDs Chart 1 - !scope=\\"row\\"Portuguese Music DVDs Chart 9 - !scope=\\"row\\"Spanish Music DVDs Chart 2 - !scope=\\"row\\"Swedish Music DVDs Chart Search for Michael Jackson and click Sök. 1 - !scope=\\"row\\"Swiss Music DVDs Chart 2 - !scope=\\"row\\"UK Music Videos Chart 2 - !scope=\\"row\\"US Billboard DVDs Chart 1 - } ==CertificationsReferences== Category:2012 video albums Category:Michael Jackson video albums Category:2012 live albums Category:Live video albums Category:Michael Jackson live albums ","title":"Live at Wembley July 16, 1988"},{"id":"35893573","text":"Caribbean is a 2004 board game designed by Michail Antonow and Jens-Peter Schliemann. The game was nominated for the 2005 Vuoden Peli Adult Game of the Year. ==Rules== Caribbean is a game for two to four players, taking place in the Caribbean in the 18th century. Six pirate ships, named Arriba, Bravo, Caribic, Diabolo, Evita and Fuego, sail the waters, intent on plundering treasure from ports both on the continent and on several islands. The players are looking to make as much profit as possible from this plundering. However, the players do not have direct control over the ships - their pirate crews work independently, and so the players have to bribe them with barrels of rum to get to issue them orders. To this end, each player has seven cards, each containing a different number of barrels. Six of these are numbered from 0 to 5, and the seventh is a special \\"robber\\" card, numbered -1. At the start of a round, each player assigns six of their cards, in secret, to the six pirate ships, deciding on how much rum they want to bribe each ship's crew with. After this, the players go through the ships one by one, revealing their bribes for the ship in question. The player with the highest bribe gets to move the ship, as many places as there are barrels on their bribe card. In case of a tie, the players may opt to reveal their seventh card as a tie- breaker. This tie-breaker may only be used once per round. If another player has assigned the \\"robber\\" card to the ship in question, one barrel of rum is stolen from the player with the highest bribe. Players gain money by plundering treasure from ports and taking it to their secret hide-outs, indicated on the board by a coloured border around the place, with the colour corresponding to the player's own chosen colour. The first player to reach a pre-set sum of money wins. ==References * Caribbean at BoardGameGeek Category:Board games introduced in 2004 ","title":"Caribbean (board game)"},{"id":"35893591","text":"Trit may refer to: * Ternary digit, see Ternary numeral system * Tirit, an ancient recipe using leftovers ","title":"Trit"},{"id":"35893654","text":"Hydrogen Energy California Facility ProcessHydrogen Energy California (HECA) was an alternative energy, hydrogen power project in development with support from the U.S. Department of Energy in Kern County, California. The facility proposed to convert coal and refinery waste into an impure hydrogen fuel that would be used to generate electricity and fertilizer. HECA was supposed to capture ninety percent of its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to theoretically minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and inject it, for enhanced oil recovery. If it had become fully operational, HECA would have generated nearly 300MW of clean electricity and will produce one million tons of locally manufactured, low-carbon fertilizer. But, most of the electricity produced by HECA would have been consumed by the different processes at the plant. On March 4, 2016, the California Energy Commission ordered the HECA application to be terminated. HECA would have produced over 500 tons of criteria air pollutants. This air pollution would have been added to an area that already has the worst air pollution in the entire United States. The facility was to be located on of prime farmland in western Kern County, about west of Bakersfield and northwest of the unincorporated community of Tupman. The site is near the Elk Hills Oil Field where the captured CO2 was to be used for enhanced oil recovery by Occidental of Elk Hills, Inc. HECA would have employed an expected 2,000 union workers to construct the facility and would have created approximately 200 permanent jobs. HECA was a project of SCS Energy LLC, an independent developer of clean power. HECA was cofunded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Fossil Energy and administered by the National Energy Technology Laboratory. The HECA project was awarded a $408 million grant by the U.S. Department of Energy under Clean Coal Power Initiative Round 3. ==Process== The HECA project will be an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) facility using Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.’s oxygen–blown gasifier technology. IGCC technology allows for highly efficient power generation with minimal emissions. IGGC facilities, including HECA, are different from conventional fossil fueled power generation plants in that there is no combustion of the actual fossil fuels. Instead, HECA converts, through gasification, a blend of recycled petroleum coke, a low value by-product that comes from oil refining, and coal to manufacture hydrogen fuel. The clean burning hydrogen fuel will be used for two purposes: to generate low-carbon electricity; and to produce approximately one million tons of low-carbon fertilizer per year. A Rectisol acid gas removal system will separate and capture more than ninety percent of the carbon dioxide (CO2) produced during the hydrogen manufacturing process. Most of the captured CO2 will be used for enhanced oil recovery at the nearby Elk Hills Oil Field, enabling the production of millions of additional barrels of domestic oil, a 10-20% increase in the amount of oil recovered. Some of the CO2 will be used in the manufacturing of fertilizer. The project will use brackish groundwater for its process water needs and will have a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) system in order to protect and conserve local freshwater sources. ==Schedule== The project was currently progressing through the regulatory approval process, and was expected to be completed and operating by 2017. But, the project has now been terminated by the California Energy Commission for lack of progress. ==External links== * Hydrogen Energy California information * Hydrogen Energy California website * HECA Project Facts * HECA Project Description ==References== Category:Hydrogen economy Category:Energy infrastructure in California Category:Power stations in California ","title":"Hydrogen Energy California"},{"id":"35893659","text":"Adella Beach is an unincorporated community in the town of Neenah, Winnebago County, Wisconsin, United States. ==Notes== Category:Unincorporated communities in Winnebago County, Wisconsin Category:Unincorporated communities in Wisconsin ","title":"Adella Beach, Wisconsin"},{"id":"35893675","text":"PCB with a 1/3\\" Sony CCD Camera modules may include a lens (shown at top), an image sensor (shown at bottom), and supporting circuitry.

The building is a \\"historic and cultural monument of the people of the Russian Federation\\" and is located at Moika Embankment 73-79 at the corner of Gorokhovaya Street, before the Red Bridge over the Moika. ==History== The building was constructed in 1906-07 by architects Konstantin de Rochefort (see article in Russian Wikipedia) and V.A. Lipskii.http://www.lds- uk.com/projects/au-pont-rouge Until 1919 it functioned as the \\"S. Esders and K. Scheyfals Trading House\\", also known as У красного моста (U krasnova mosta, \\"By the Red Bridge\\"). Signs on the building were in Russian and French — the French name indicated as Au Pont Rouge. It was an undertaking of Stefan Esders (see the article in German Wikipedia), who had a factory in Brussels and department stores in Berlin, Paris, Rotterdam, Breslau (now Wrocław) and Vienna in addition to St. Petersburg. Scheefhals was the Dutch partner for the St. Petersburg branch. After the revolution, in 1919, the building became a sewing factory producing menswear. In 1922 it was given the name Volodarsky Sewing Factory in honor of the Marxist revolutionary and early Soviet politician Moisei Goldstein, who went by the name of V. Volodarsky. The cupola was torn down in the 1930s in order not to spoil the view of the Admiralty tower. (picture) In 1992 the factory was reorganized as FOSP (Fabrika odezhdy Sankt-Peterburga, Фабрика одежды Санкт-Петербурга, \\"Saint Petersburg Clothing Factory\\").http://karpovka.net/2007/12/23/732/ The building underwent extensive renovation by BTK Development in 2011-12, and the cupola was rebuilt. The original department store signage, in French and Russian (with pre- revolutionary spelling), has also been restored. The building is set to reopen in 2016 housing a department store designed by London-based architectural practice Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands. ==References *William Craft Brumfield, 'The Origins of Modernism in Russian Architecture, p.222 * Project information on Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands website.

The film was released on direct-to-DVD and Blu- ray in Canada on March 1, 2011. The film is about a cop turns vigilante after his family has been murdered, exacting vengeance on the killers and then on all criminals who have slipped through the system. This film serves as somewhat of a reboot to the 1998 film of the same name ==Plot== Ryan Varrett (Steve Austin), is an ex-cop determined to avenge the murder of his family. In 2009, when Ryan was a cop in Dallas, Texas, his wife Constance Marie Varrett (Rebecca Robbins) and 9-year-old son Matt Ryan Varrett (Connor Stanhope) were viciously killed by a gang. Ryan survived the assault and killed three of the gang. However, Ryan quits the Dallas police and hits the road to find everyone else responsible for the deaths of his loved ones. Special Agent Frank Sutton (Lochlyn Munro) of the FBI's Seattle office is investigating the deaths of criminals. After killing a rapist named Dale James Burrows (Roman Podhora), Ryan ends up in the small town of Hope, Washington, where a gas station owner named Kirby (Patrick Gilmore) directs Ryan to a tiny hotel run by a woman named Darcy (Serinda Swan). Ryan finds Rex Ray Salgado (Noel Gugliemi), a member of the gang that attacked Ryan's family. It turns out that Hope is under the control of the Circle, a drug and arms dealing biker gang led by Rex's brother, Drayke Salgado (Danny Trejo), who is on the ATF's most wanted list. Sheriff Cole (Tom McBeath) is in Drayke's pocket, so Ryan has only himself and Darcy to depend on. Ryan kills Rex, Drayke declares war on Ryan, and the town of Hope becomes a battleground. It turns out that Drayke masterminded the shooting of Ryan's family members, and the families of other cops who years ago sent him to prison, where he was brutalized. Drayke got even with the prisoners who brutalized him, then got even with the cops who put him away. After Kirby is killed by Crab (Keith Jardine), Drayke's right- hand man, Sutton arrives in town, and Cole tries to convince him that Rex's death was an accident. Cole thinks that by appeasing the bikers, he is protecting the town from more bloodshed. Ryan finds Crab and burns him to death. Since Cole is not much help, Sutton goes to Cole's son, Deputy Hedge (Adam Greydon Reid), who is not in Drayke's pocket. Hedge explains that a long-time ago, the Circle used to protect the town. That was before Drayke took over and started running guns. Rex provided Drayke with a recipe for meth, and Drayke and his gang started selling drugs too. However, Drayke and his gang are arming themselves for all-out war against Ryan, and they don't care whom they have to kill. At night, Darcy hears bikers approaching her hotel. Ryan kills the three bikers. Outside, more bikers grab Darcy and beat Ryan up. On the next day, Ryan has been taken to Drayke, and some of his men bring Darcy into the room. Darcy is held tied up with tape on her mouth. They're on an abandoned ferry boat that Drayke uses as his headquarters. Drayke leaves his man Prospect (Tygh Runyan) to beat Ryan up. Ryan breaks free from his restraints and takes care of Prospect. Ryan overcomes Drayke's men, finds Darcy who is tied to a chair and gagged with tape. Deputy Hedge goes to his father's house and finds Cole has shot himself. With Sutton's help Hedge plans to go after Drayke. Ryan remembers Drayke being present during the attack on his family. Until Ryan came to Hope, Drayke thought Ryan was dead. Ryan and Drayke start fighting. A shot kills Drayke. It was Sutton who fired the shot. Darcy decides that she's going to stay in Hope, and Sutton decides to not arrest Ryan. Hedge becomes the new sheriff. Ryan decides to leave town, but promises Darcy that he will send her a postcard to let her know where he is. ==Cast== * Steve Austin as Ryan Varrett * Serinda Swan as Darcy * Danny Trejo as Drake Salgado * Keith Jardine as Crab * Lochlyn Munro as Agent Frank Sutton * Noel Gugliemi as Rex Salgado * Adam Greydon Reid as Deputy Hedge * Tom McBeath as Sheriff Cole * Patrick Gilmore as Kirby * Tygh Runyan as The Prospect * Rebecca Robbins as Connie Varrett * Connor Stanhope as Matt Ryan Varrett * Roman Podhora as Dale Burrows * Daniel Boileau as Frank * Jase Anthony Griffith as Lou ==Illegal downloading== In 2012, Canadian judge ruled in favour of Recoil's production company, NGN Prima Production, and ordered internet service providers to reveal the names and addresses of people who had allegedly downloaded the film illegally.

It was a decisive Byzantine victory, which ended the Norman threat to the Empire. ==Background== The fall of Thessalonica and the Norman advance towards Constantinople precipitated the downfall of the Byzantine emperor Andronikos I Komnenos and the elevation of Isaac II Angelos.Angold, pp. 268–269 The elevation of the new emperor led to an influx of volunteers from Byzantine Anatolia to fight the Normans. Isaac armed and paid these troops, and sent them off to join the field army already assembled under the experienced general Alexios Branas, which was placed to block the Norman advance. To the field army he sent 4,000 pounds of gold as pay and as a donative.Choniates, pp. 197–198 The Norman army that had captured Thessalonica was divided into three parts, one part remained in Thessalonica, the main army marched eastwards to the cities of Amphipolis and Serres near the Strymon River, whilst an advanced guard pushed further on the road towards Constantinople, reaching Mosynopolis, which it occupied. Choniates states that the Normans, having encountered little resistance thus far, had become overconfident and reckless. The reinforced Byzantine army under Branas attacked the Norman advanced guard, routing a division of this force and pursuing it back to the town before again defeating it outside its walls. The gates of Mosynopolis were set alight and the Byzantines stormed in, slaughtering the defenders.Choniates, p. 198 ==Battle== Branas led his army towards the Normans who were laying waste the area around Amphipolis and Serres, contacting them at Demetritzes, which is to the northwest of Serres. Choniates, the main source for the battle, does not describe the conflict in any tactical detail. Instead, he makes much of the confidence that the Byzantine troops had gained from their earlier success at Mosynopolis, and the loss of morale the Normans had suffered for the same reason. The Normans initially offered to negotiate and sue for peace. Branas took this as a sign of weakness and cowardice. On the 7 November the Byzantine army launched a sudden attack on the Normans and routed them. The Normans received the initial attack with some success, but, after a varying contest, they gave way before the impetuous Byzantine assault and fled. Some were cut down in flight, others driven into the Strymon, many were taken prisoner. The Byzantine victory was complete; the Norman leaders, Count Richard d'Accera and Count Baldwin (or Aldoin), both being made captive.Choniates, p. 199Angold, p. 271 Also captured was Alexios Komnenos, once the imperial pinkernes (\\"cupbearer\\"), an illegitimate son of Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos. He had served as a figurehead for the Normans, who used the pretext of supporting his claim to the imperial throne as a means to claim legitimacy for their invasion.Brown, p. 203 ==Aftermath== Pursued by the Byzantines, the surviving Normans fled to Thessalonica, which was abandoned without battle; the remnants of the Norman army fled by sea with many ships being subsequently lost to storms. Any Normans who did not manage to escape from Thessalonica were massacred by the Alan troops of the Byzantine army in revenge for the deaths of their kinsmen when the city was sacked. The Norman fleet under Tancred of Lecce, which was in the Sea of Marmara, also withdrew. The city of Dyrrhachium on the Adriatic coast was the only part of the Balkans that remained in Norman hands and this fell the following Spring after a siege, effectively ending the attempted Sicilian conquest of the Empire. The Kingdom of Sicily had suffered enormous losses in killed and captured. More than four thousand captives were sent to Constantinople, where they suffered great mistreatment at the hands of Isaac II.Choniates, pp. 199-201Angold, p. 272 ==ReferencesSources== *Angold, M.

Her release \\"Give It Up For Me\\" on Mau5trap Recordings was one of Beatport’s highest selling songs, earning Sydney the rank of first female electronic music producer to have a Top 10 hit on the platform. Sydney’s success is largely attributed to the relentless touring schedule which she’s upheld over the years. In the spring of 2010, after leaving a long time residency at Toronto’s Guvernment nightclub, Sydney landed a residency in Miami, Florida. Partnering with Opium Group, Sydney became a resident at Mansion Miami, the hottest club in South Beach at that time. Shortly thereafter, Sydney's North American performance schedule grew, headlining such major venues as Output Brooklyn NY, Pacha NYC, Stereo Montreal, Space Miami, Avalon & Exchange Los Angeles, and Beta Denver. Then in November 2011, Sydney performed at the Rogers Centre in Toronto, for the Deadmau5 Meowingtons Hax Tour before 35,000 fans. The evening went down as the largest solo headlining dance event in Canadian history. Since then, Sydney has headlined nightclubs and been on festival lineup’s all over the globe. Last year she played main stage at Electric Island Festival with Green Velvet, The Martinez Brothers, Anna, Archie Hamilton, Danny Daze, Nicole Moudaber, Rodriguez Jr, Ellen Allien, Charlotte De Witte, DJ Tennis and more. In addition, Sydney has played main stage at festivals such as Digital Dreams Toronto, Ever After Festival Waterloo, Evolve Festival Halifax, Burning Man Festival, and Ultra Music Festival Miami. Globally, Sydney Blu has enchanted crowds with performances in Europe, Brazil, Colombia, Asia, Mexico, Tunisia, Pakistan, and Egypt. Reaching even further, Sydney also hosts 40 radio syndications worldwide, where she connects with audiences through her live mixes and curation. The Blu Party, having originally launched in 2010 during Miami Music Week, has continued annually and is one of the most anticipated events during the week. Featuring A-list headliners whom support Sydney's underground tone, the Blu Party has featured performances from such names as Pleasurekraft, Riva Starr, Kevin Saunderson, Stacey Pullen, Carlo Lio, Britta Unders, Yousef, Christian Smith, wAFF, Francesca Lombardo, Nathan Barato, Fur Coat, Lee Reynolds of Desert Hearts, De La Swing of El Row, Serge Devant, Doc Martin, Christian Martin, Kenny Glasgow, Joeski, Black Motion and Gene Farris. Following a successful inauguration at Detroit's Movement 2016 weekend and several showcases throughout North America (including a ten-years-running streak at Miami Music Week), the Blu Party is set to continue its underground rein well into 2021 celebrating it’s ten year anniversary. After her first solo album, Relentless (2015), the past 5 years have been huge years for Sydney Blu releases. The Canadian artist released and charted top ten releases throughout the 3 year time span on labels like Hot Since 82’s Knee Deep in Sound, Desert Hearts, Kevin Saunderson’s KMS Records, Elrow, Steve Lawler’s VIVa Music, Supernova’s Lapsus Music, Roger Sanchez’s Under the Rdr and the legendary melodic house label Katermukke, record label of Berlin nightclub Katerblau . Sydney has also been remixed these past few years by Bulgarian techno queen Gallya, tech house legend Pirupa and Deep house chart topper Collective Machine. She has also received play from house & techno giants Nic Fancuilli, Steve Lawler, Carlo Lio, Hot Since 82, Joseph Capriati, Roger Sanchez and many more. In 2018, Sydney’s first single on Hot Since 82’s Knee Deep in Sound was premiered by Billboard Magazine and climbed to the top of the Beatport Tech house chart. It also was the #1 selling song on Knee Deep in Sound’s ADE Sampler and was featured several times at the world famous Elrow Party. Following this release was another release called ‘Escape’ on the fresh UK label Underground Audio which climbed to #8 in the Top ten on Beatport. A new album is on the horizon for Sydney Blu, set to be released before the end of 2020. ==DiscographyAlbums=== Studio albums *Relentless (2015) Compilation albums *Change the Game (2013) Live albums *Live At Mansion (2011) ===Singles=== *Give It Up For Me - March 2008 (mau5trap) *Senses and the Mind - December 2008 (mau5trap) *Instinct - March 2009 (Blu Music) *Panic Attack - May 2009 (with Matteo DiMarr) (Blu Music) *Sleeping Awake - May 2009 (Blu Music) *Lights Out - March 2011 (with Trent Cantrelle and the Manufactured Superstars) (Blu Music) *The Lockout - May 2011 (with Jquintel) (Spinnin') *Devastating (with Damaged Goods) - January 2012 (Blu Music) *Xfactor - February 2012 (Zenbi Recordings) *Chemistry - July 2012 (Blackhole) *Another Late Night feat MC Flipside - October 2012 (Blackhole) *Whiplash (with Damaged Goods) - October 2012 (Funk Farm) *Nightlight feat Betsie Larkin - January 2013 (Blackhole) *Change the Game - April 2013 (Blackhole) *NYCMIA - June 2013 (Black Hole) *Who Gives a #$%? - October 2013 (Hotfingers) *Little Things - Dec 2013 (Blu Music) *Together - June 2014 (Endgame Records) *Motivate - May 2014 (Hotfingers) *My Neighbors Hate Me - November 2014 (Black Hole) *VNDERGROUND/It Doesn't Matter January 2015 (KMS Records) *Need I Say More/You Were the One w/Dramirez - April 2015 (Hotfingers) *Teardrop - April 2015 (Blu Music) *Mad World April 2015 (Pornostar) *Relentless Album - July 27, 2015 (Black Hole) *What's Inside/Centipede - August 2015 (Black Hole) *Electric Era - Dec 2015 (Black Hole) *Stoned/Don't Mess Around - February 2016 (Kinetika) *Too Clean - June 2016 (Toolroom Records) *Eterno/March - September 2016 (Blu Music) *Jackrabbit Ep - December 2016 (Playmobil Records/Material Series) *Momento - January 2017 (VIVa Music) *Rock it Out - March 2017 (Blu Music) *Hella Dope - April 2017 (Kinetika Records) *You Know How it Goes/Incognito - April 2017 (Farris Wheel Recordings) *Throwdown - April 2017 (Farris Wheel Recordings) *You Don't Understand/Catch My Flow - August 2017 (Soup NYC) *Inspirato/Take it Back - August 2017 (Undr The Rdr) *Mind Games - October 2017 (Knee Deep in Sound) *Nanabijou - December 2017 (Maya Recordings) *Do the Math/Plot Twist - March 2018 (SOUP NYC) *On the Brink - March 2018 (Lapsus Music) *Escape/First Few Minutes - June 2018 (Underground Audio) *Runaway - July 2018 (Mad Tech Records) *Espinal & Nova - Be With You (Sydney Blu Remix) - October 2018 (SOUP NYC) *Get Over Yourself - January 2019 (Desert Hearts) *Intuition - December 2019 (KMS Records) *Collective Machine - 90s Run (Sydney Blu Remix) - June 2020 (Collective Music) *Temple - August 2020 (Katermukke) ==References* * Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian house musicians Category:Canadian electronic musicians Category:Canadian DJs Category:Female DJs Category:Remixers Category:Mau5trap artists Category:Canadian women in electronic music Category:Electronic dance music DJs Category:21st-century women musicians Category:Canadian women record producers ","title":"Sydney Blu"},{"id":"35893899","text":"László Böcskei (; born July 11, 1965) is a Romanian cleric, bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oradea Mare.

The writings of Mendes include Expeditionis Aethiopicae, which describes the customs and conditions of Ethiopia. == Life == Mendes was born in Santo Aleixo. He entered the Society of Jesus, where he was ordained priest, he received his doctorate in theology at the University of Coimbra, where he subsequently taught at the College of Arts. In response to the favor Emperor Susenyos of Ethiopia showed towards Catholicism, Mendes was appointed Patriarch of Ethiopia by Pope Urban VIII, and left for Ethiopia in March 1623. The journey to Ethiopia was long and difficult. Mendes' party reached Portuguese Mozambique that September, where they were delayed by winter weather, and only reached Goa on 28 May 1624. After making further preparations in Goa, the Patriarch sailed for Beilul by way of Diu (where he was joined by Jerónimo Lobo), and arrived at Beilul on 2 May 1625.Téllez, Travels, p. 225 This port on the Red Sea was controlled by the king of the Afars, who was a vassal to the Emperor of Ethiopia; the primary port of entrance to Ethiopia, Massawa, was at the time controlled by the Ottoman Empire, which was hostile to both Ethiopian and European interests. The party crossed the desert into the Ethiopian highlands, and reached Fremona, the base of Catholic missionary efforts, on 21 June 1625, over two years after Mendes had left Lisbon.Mendes' journey from Diu to Fremona is described in Jerónimo Lobo, The Itinerário of Jerónimo Lobo, translated by Donald M. Lockhart (London: Hakluyt Society, 1984), pp. 71–153 At a public ceremony on 11 February 1626, the Emperor Susenyos and Patriarch Mendes publicly acknowledged the primacy of the Roman See and made Catholicism the state religion.Téllez, Travels, p. 233 A number of local practices were condemned, which included Saturday Sabbath and frequent fasts. For a time, conversions were made, the monarch frequently resorting to compulsion. Richard Pankhurst reports 100,000 inhabitants of Dembiya and Wegera alone are said to have converted to Catholicism.Pankhurst, The Ethiopians: A History (Oxford: Blackwell, 2001), p. 107 However, strife and rebellions over the enforced changes began within days of the public ceremony, and at one point the Emperor's son, Fasilides, sided with the native church. After many years of chronic civil war, on 14 June 1632, Emperor Susenyos issued a formal declaration that those who would follow the Catholic faith were allowed to do so, but no one would be forced to do so any further. Patriarch Mendes could only confirm that this was, indeed, the actual will of the Emperor, his protector.James Bruce, Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile (1805 edition), vol. 3 pp. 403ff Upon succeeding his father, Fasilides first confined the Catholic hierarchy to Fremona, then in 1634 exiled the Patriarch and several of the foreign priests from Ethiopia, who were exposed to robbery, assaults and other indignities by the local population before reaching the Ottoman Naib at Massawa. The Naib sent them to his superior at Suakin, where the Pasha forced the party to pay a ransom before they could proceed to India. Despite settling for a ransom of 4300 patacas (which he borrowed from local Banyan merchants), at the last moment the Pasha insisted on keeping Patriarch Mendes, two priests, three cleric and two of his servants. Amongst those who departed Suakin on 26 August was Jerónimo Lobo.An account of the exile and expulsion of Mendes and the other Jesuits can be found in Lobo, The Itinerário, pp. 251–285 These were kept prisoner until Mendes managed to raise 4000 pieces of eight as their ransom, and the Pasha put them on a ship bound for Diu on 24 April 1635. They reached Diu a month later, and Mendes immediately continued on to Goa, where he unsuccessfully sought military support for his restoration.Téllez, Travels, p. 260 He appears to have spent the rest of his life in Goa, where he wrote his book on Ethiopian history and geography and the Jesuit mission in Ethiopia, Expeditionis Aethiopicae.Mendes, Alphonso.

He led a prolific musical and acting career from the 1950s to the 1990s before retiring. He was best known for his long music career, including his brief tenure as lead singer of the Crickets from 1958 to 1960, and for his acting roles in numerous low budget movies and TV shows in the 60s. ==Music career== Sinks was performing with Bob Wills at age 12 before doing his first recordings in 1958 at Norman Petty Studios as a solo artist. Under the alias of \\"Earl Henry\\" he had 2 singles \\"I Am The Man/Whatcha Gonna Do?\\" and \\"My Suzanne/Believe A Traveler\\" on Dot Records. After Buddy Holly split with The Crickets near the end of 1958, Sinks was brought in by Norman Petty to record, noting a similarity in their singing styles. He recorded and performed with the Crickets after Holly's death in 1959, contributing to the album In Style With the Crickets, singing on songs such as \\"I Fought the Law,\\" \\"Love's Made a Fool of You\\", \\"Deborah\\", and \\"When You Ask About Love\\". Sinks' association with the Crickets ended in February 1960, citing a disagreement. David Box was later brought in to finish recording and fulfill the band's contract with Coral Records. Sinks later moved to Nashville, where he continued to release records. He recorded for Decca Records, in addition to Hickory, Capitol, Coral, Brunswick, United Artist, Warner Brothers and Ace of Hearts Records. He and Norro Wilson, along with Bill Fernez, recorded as the band the Omegas [country music]. In October 1958 Tommy Allsup rejoined the Crickets for the \\"Biggest Show of Stars: Autumn Edition”, after Buddy split from Jerry Allison and Joe Mauldin. The Roses (a vocal backup group) were also on the tour. Needing a new band for the planned “Winter Dance Party Tour”, Buddy asked his pal Waylon Jennings to play bass, with Tommy on guitar and Allsup's pal Carl Bunch for drums. After the tragedy, Tommy Allsup and Earl remained in New York following the end of the “Winter Dance Party Tour” for promotional pictures with J.I. and Joe B. as The Crickets. Sinks had recorded earlier with the Crickets, along with Sonny Curtis, and sang lead on their version of \\"I Fought the Law,” “Someone Someone,” and “Loves Made A Fool of You.\\" In 1959 he came to Nashville with his pal Bob Montgomery, where they worked together as songwriters with Acuff-Rose. He recorded under the names of Earl Sinks, Sinx Mitchell, Earl Richards and Earl \\"Snake\\" Richards. He wrote songs for artists such as Sue Thompson, the Everly Brothers, the Newbeats, Ernie Ashworth, Brenda Lee, Roy Orbison, Mel Tillis, as well as the Crickets and Buddy Holly. He would either play guitar or sing harmony over a majority of the sessions with artists such as Mel Tillis, Del Reeves, Mel Street, Charlie Pride, etc. ==Acting== When Nashville filmmaker Ron Ormond started looking for a star for his low-budget films in the mid-1960s, he asked Smiley Wilson (artist and booking agent), and Smiley recommended his son-in-law Earl. At this time, Earl was recording for the Warner Brothers record label as well as appearing in some of the Warner Brothers television shows, such as Cheyenne, Sugarfoot, and Surfside Six. In his first Ormond film, Girl From Tobacco Row, Sinks found himself with a nickname. When talking with Ken Beck of the Tennessean newspaper he said \\"Ron gave me that name\\", and from then on, all the jocks (deejays) started calling him Snake Richards. Along with Girl From Tobacco Row, Ormond's film White Lightnin' Road also included Earl as \\"Snake\\" and also later in the 20th Century Fox film by Richard Ball That Tennessee Beat. ==Later life== By the 1970s Sinks was tuned in more to the business end of things and ran Ace of Hearts Records and acted also as producer. Over the years he notably produced artists such as John Anderson, Faron Young, Joyce Cobb, Jimmy Dickens, Porter Wagoner, Mark Dinning, The Remingtons, Bobby Lewis, Mel Street and many more. He stated \\"It was great being an entertainer as well as singing and or playing on so many sessions, writing the songs, etc. but I'm glad I gradually drifted over to the business side.\\" According to the Nashville Tennessean, \\"Snake\\" lived with his wife, once known as Little Rita Faye on the Grand Old Opry and the daughter of country stars Smiley and Kitty Wilson. They were married for over 50 years and lived in Goodlettsville, where wife, Rita, still resides and their son Brandon Earl Sinks keeps the music tradition going. Earl Sinks died at his home on Saturday, May 13, 2017. ==DiscographySolo=== Studio Albums *The Sun Is Shining (On Everybody But Me) (1970) 5 Singles *\\"Whatcha Gonna Do?\\" / \\"I Am The Man\\" (1958) 1 *\\"My Suzanne\\" / \\"Believe A Traveller\\" (1958) 1 *\\"Look For Me (I'll Be There)\\" / \\"Super Market\\" (1961) 2 *\\"Little Susie Parker\\" / \\"Superstitious\\" (1961) 2 *\\"Be Good\\" / \\"A Little Bit Of Heaven\\" (1962) 3 *\\"Looking For Love\\" / \\"Raining On My Side of Town\\" (1963) 3 *\\"Love Is All I'm Asking For\\" / \\"This Weird Sensation\\" (1964) 4 *\\"The Language Of Love\\" / \\"Return To Thunder Road\\" (1965) 3 *\\"Maggie\\" / \\"Shake 'Em Up And Let 'Em Roll\\" (1968) 5 *\\"The House Of Blue Lights\\" / \\"Hard Times A Comin'\\" (1969) 5 *\\"Corrine, Corrina\\" / \\"Climbing A Mountain\\" (1969) 5 *\\"What You Gonna Do, Leroy?\\" / \\"Can't Live Down The Lovin'\\" (1970) 5 *\\"Sunshine\\" / \\"San Francisco Mabel Joy\\" (1970) 5 *\\"Baby I Need Your Lovin\\" / \\"Our House On Paper\\" (1971) 5 *\\"You Were Crying\\" / \\"You Drove Her Right Into My Arms\\" (1971) 5 *\\"Down Along The Cove\\" / \\"Let It Be\\" (1972) 5 *\\"Margie, Who's Watching The Baby?\\" / \\"My Land\\" (1972) 5 *\\"Things Are Kinda Slow At The House\\" / \\"Do My Playing At Home\\" (1973) 5 *\\"The Sun Is Shining (On Everybody But Me)\\" / \\"Mother Nature's Daughter\\" (1973) 5 *\\"How Can I Tell Her\\" / \\"Walkin' In Teardrops\\" (1973) 5 *\\"Julianne\\" / \\"House of Blue Lights\\" (1977) 5 Compilations *Earl Richards (1976) 5 *House of Blue Lights (1977) 5 *The Man With 1000 Names a.k.a.

They soon added two drummers, Jeff Armour, and Kevin Teare in 1975, and the quartet contributed the instrumental composition, Spoonfight, to Bloomington I (Bar-B-Q records 1976). Rich Stim (vocals, guitar, and sax) and Dave Mahoney (drums), both formerly of Chinaboise, joined MX-80 in 1976 and Teare left the band to pursue a full-time art career. Anderson and Stim emerged as the band's primary songwriters, with occasional lyric writing by Andrea Ross (aka Angel Corpus Christi). Unable to obtain gigs in most local music venues, MX-80 performed a regular series of Sunday concerts at the Monroe County public library, tracks of which were later compiled on CD. The band's first studio release was the EP, Big Hits: Hard Pop From The Hoosiers (Bar-B-Q Records 1976), recorded at Gilfoy Studios, produced by Mark Bingham and engineered by Mark Hood. A review of Big Hits in the British music magazine Sounds by Caroline Coon, spurred Island Records A&R; man Howard Thompson to license the band's second recording, their debut LP, Hard Attack (1977). ==Hard Attack== Hard Attack, also produced by Mark Bingham at Gilfoy Studios in Bloomington, was released only in Europe. Like their late-1970s midwestern compatriots Pere Ubu and Debris, MX-80's initial recording had little commercial success and critics were unsure what to make of them. Glenn O’Brien writing in Interview said of MX-80's debut, “[It] should establish MX-80 as either the most Heavy Metal Art Band or the most Arty Heavy Metal Band.” Chuck Eddy called Hard Attack \\"a distorted free for all that set some eternal noisecore standard.\\"Eddy, Chuck, Stairway to Hell: The 500 Best Heavy Metal Albums (1998) ==San Francisco and Ralph Records== MX-80 relocated to San Francisco in 1978, a tumultuous year when the city reverberated from the Dan White shootings and subsequent riots (reflected in the track \\"White Night\\") and the Peoples Temple mass suicide (the band performed at the nearby Temple Beautiful soon after the tragedy, overlooking a parking lot filled with the victim's cars). MX-80 also performed at prominent punk venues such as the Mabuhay Gardens, Deaf Club, and Savoy Tivoli but the local reception was not enthusiastic and the band was considered out of sync with the punk and new-wave sensibility of groups such as Germs, Dils, and Avengers. Disheartened by the reaction, drummer Jeff Armour soon departed, reducing the band to a quartet. In 1979, The Residents signed MX-80 to their label, Ralph Records, and two releases followed. The first Ralph recording, Out of the Tunnel (1980), was recorded at Mobius Music Studios, again with Mark Bingham producing. The album's back cover art was photographed by Kim Torgerson at San Francisco's now-buried Ocean Beach tunnels. Ira Robbins, writing in Trouser Press, said \\"Out of the Tunnel may well be MX-80's high- tide-mark, featuring convoluted breakneck melodies, cross-fed musical genres and Anderson's white hot soloing.\\" Their second Ralph release, Crowd Control (1981), was recorded at New York's Celebration Studios and was their final collaboration with producer Mark Bingham. Though Crowd Control contained two love songs – \\"Obsessive Devotion\\" and \\"Promise of Love\\" – compared to Out of the Tunnel, it was considered “a darker album, from a much darker year, ” and in general, “found the quartet simplifying some of the arrangements without losing the sense of crackling intensity and playful-while-being-serious performing of earlier efforts.” ==After Ralph== After their relationship with Ralph Records ended, MX-80 dropped the \\"Sound\\" from its moniker and was allegedly plagued by legal problems (the details of which were never made clear). In 1984, the band returned with a two-drummer format with the addition of Marc Weinstein (ex-Mutants). The following year guitarist Jim Hrabetin (also ex-Mutants) joined. In 1986, the band released a cassette recording, Existential Lover (Quadruped). In 1990, the band combined previously released TV and movie themes with \\"furiously thrashed original material,\\"Short Circuit, NME, 6 October 1990 for the album, Das Love Boat (a&r;/ENT), perhaps the only instrumental recording to get a Parental Advisory). In 1994, the band performed at Steve Albini's baseball-themed ’PineTar .406’ concert in Chicago and the following year, MX-80 released their gloomiest recording, I’ve Seen Enough (Atavistic). Produced by and featuring David Immerglück (Camper Van Beethoven/Monks of Doom/Counting Crows), the album was dismissed by critics as “dull, slow shit … like some bland off-brand ginger ale.\\" It was followed by a live recording of a Chicago concert, Always Leave ‘Em Wanting Less (Atavistic, 1997). In 2002, the band unearthed some live tapes from the 1970s resulting in the Gulcher release, Live at the Library. In 2005, the band recorded and released We’re an American Band (Family Vineyard), featuring an oblique take on the Grand Funk Railroad title track. Forced Exposure called the album “both hilariously depressing and morosely upbeat … a masterwork that mixes Satan, Howard Hughes and current theories on brain transplants.\\" In 2006, long-time drummer Dave Mahoney died. MX-80 continues to reside and record in the San Francisco Bay Area. == Discography == *Big Hits EP (1976) *Hard Attack (1977) *Out of the Tunnel (1980) *Crowd Control (1981) *Existential Lover (1987) *Das Love Boat (1990) *I've Seen Enough (1995) *Always Leave 'Em Wanting Less (1997) *Live at the Library (2002) *We're an American Band (2005) *So Funny (2015) ==References *Official MX-80 Sound Site *MX-80 Sound discography at Discogs.com Category:Musical groups established in 1974 Category:Art rock musical groups Category:Protopunk groups Category:American post-punk music groups Category:Island Records artists Category:Punk rock groups from Indiana Category:Atavistic Records artists ","title":"MX-80"},{"id":"35894206","text":"Córdoba () is a province of Argentina, located in the center of the country. Neighboring provinces are (clockwise from the north): Santiago del Estero, Santa Fe, Buenos Aires, La Pampa, San Luis, La Rioja and Catamarca. Together with Santa Fe and Entre Ríos, the province is part of the economic and political association known as the Center Region. Córdoba is the second most populous Argentine province, with 3,308,876 inhabitants,Proyecciones y estimaciones de población 2001-2015 - INDEC - Pág 16. and the fifth by size, at about . Almost 41% of its inhabitants reside in the capital city, Córdoba, and its surroundings, making it the second most populous metro area in Argentina. ==History== Before the Spanish conquista the region now called Córdoba Province was inhabited by indigenous groups, most notably the Comechingones and Sanavirones. Once settled in Alto Perú, the Spaniards searched for a route to the Río de la Plata port in the Atlantic Ocean to transport the Peruvian gold and silver to Europe. Córdoba de la Nueva Andalucía (nowadays the city of Córdoba) was founded as a middle point on that route on July 6, 1573 by Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera. The Colegio Convictorio de Nuestra Señora de Monserrat was founded by the Jesuits in 1599, followed by the National University of Córdoba, Argentina's first university, in 1613. The city continued to grow as an important cultural center, supported by the trade of precious metals from Peru. In 1761 a printing press was installed in the University. In 1783, seven years after the consolidation of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, the Intendency of Córdoba became the capital of what now includes the La Rioja, Mendoza, San Juan and San Luis Province, dividing the former Tucumán Intendency in two. Rafael de Sobremonte was its first governor, when Córdoba City had 38,800 inhabitants. After the May Revolution in 1810, Governor Juan Gutiérrez de la Concha joined a meeting that decided to ignore the authority of the Buenos Aires Junta. Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo attacked the city and executed the leaders of the opposition, among whom was Santiago de Liniers, leader of the resistance during the British invasions of the Río de la Plata. Led by Juan Bautista Bustos after 1820, Córdoba struggled for control of the Nation with Buenos Aires; the United Provinces of South America had neither legislative nor executive branches at the time. Córdoba sought a federal organization of the provinces while Rivadavia pushed for a centralised government in Buenos Aires. For 15 years the province was submerged in internal revolts that started to stabilize in 1868 under the provisional government of Félix de la Peña. During the presidency of Sarmiento an astronomic observatory (1871) and the Faculty of Physical Sciences and Mathematics (1873) were inaugurated. The creation of the railways and the consequent immigration brought a second wave of population growth to Córdoba. From 1887 on, several agricultural colonies (San Francisco, Marcos Juárez, etc.) emerged, while former rest-point Fraile Muerto (Bell Ville), Ferreira (Villa María) and Los Luceros (Río Segundo), on the route to Buenos Aires, became agricultural, commercial and industrial centers, respectively. The University Reform movement, which originated in Córdoba in 1918, was influential not only in Argentina but throughout South America. Modernization of the curricular contents and the improvement of the students' rights were the main achievements of the movement and in Córdoba, and were largely enacted by Governor Amadeo Sabattini, who became Argentina's most progressive governor at the time and enacted civil and land reforms that would later set the national standard. After World War II, many foreign workers and workers from other provinces in Argentina were seduced by Córdoba's industrial development, led by the expansion of the car industry. It was during Arturo Frondizi's presidency (1958–1962) that most new auto industries settled in the city of Córdoba and its surroundings. As in the rest of the country, Peronist groups emerged in 1955 following the coup that removed Juan Perón from office. These Peronist groups, together with other socialist and anarchist groups, began opposing Argentina's third military dictatorship that began in 1966. Worker and student participation in politics grew due to the widespread discontent with the appointed governor's hard-line stance, culminating in the violent May, 1969, popular revolt known as the Cordobazo. This revolt, mirrored by the Rosariazo and others in several parts of the country, undermined the power of dictator Juan Carlos Onganía and ultimately led to his ouster by more moderate military factions. Córdoba has continued to prosper, despite left-wing violence in 1973, right-wing political interference in 1974, government atrocities in 1976–77, 1978–81 free trade policies that battered Córdoba's sizable industrial sector, the 1980s debt crisis and, the recent acute financial crisis that ended in 2002. ==Geography and climate== Villa Carlos Paz Córdoba Sierras foothills. Tercero River Reservoir. Köppen climate map of Córdoba. Córdoba, located just north of the geographical center of the nation, is Argentina's fifth largest province. The main feature of the province is the presence of an extensive plain covering the eastern two thirds of the province, and the existence of three major mountain ranges which, combined, are known as Sierras de Córdoba: the easternmost range starts just west of the city of Córdoba and reaches altitudes of mostly around in the southern portion, and over further north, with a maximum altitude of at Cerro Uritorco. West of this chain, two valleys contain most of the tourist spots in the province: the Calamuchita valley in the south, and the Punilla Valley in the north, home of scenic towns such as Villa Carlos Paz, Cosquín, La Cumbre and La Falda. West of these valleys, the Sierras Grandes form the highest chain in the province: their altitude increases gradually to form a plateau of known as Pampa de Achala, culminating with Cerro Champaqui on the western part, at . West of these mountains, there is an impressive drop towards the valley known as Valle de Traslasierra, and across the valley, the Sierras Orientales reach an altitude of at Cerro Yerba Buena. On the northeast corner of the province, a natural depression forms an extensive salt lake called Laguna Mar Chiquita. The actual surface of the lake is , but during extended dry periods (such as in the 1980s) it can be a third of that, with much higher salinity. The southeastern part of the province is home to numerous ponds, lakes and wetlands. The climate of the province is predominantly temperate, with some regional variations. Generally speaking, summers are hot and humid, falls are pleasant, winters are extremely dry with strong variations in temperature, and springs are windy and variable. The eastern part of the province experiences summer average high temperatures between and lows of , with frequent thunderstorms, heat waves with temperatures higher than alternating with periods of much dryer, pleasant weather following cold fronts. Monthly precipitation during this season ranges from . Nights are noticeably cooler in March, which is also the rainiest month, and April often brings very pleasant weather with highs around and lows around . Starting in May, rainfall is low, with less than monthly during the winter. Frost arrives in late April in the south, and late May in the north. Winter temperatures average a high of and lows of , but marked variations are possible: northerly winds can push values up to and southerly winds can keep afternoon temperatures at and bring nighttime temperatures to . The air is often humid in winter, and thick fog is very common. Snowfall is very rare, almost unheard of in the northeast, but snowstorms can occur: in 2007, between covered a significant part of the region, and temperatures plummeted to -9 °C in most areas (16F). Spring is very variable, alternating between very intense heat waves and cool weather periods with severe thunderstorms, hail and strong winds. Total precipitation is over along the border with Santa Fe, and diminishes to about in the west, reaching a minimum of about 600 mm (23.5) in the southernmost part of the province. This climate allows eastern Córdoba to be the nation's main producer of soybeans and peanuts, and a large producer of maize and dairy products. The foothills of the Sierras are known for their pleasant weather: summer days are slightly cooler and the air feels much dryer despite high precipitation; winters are much dryer with less fog and less wind, and more pleasant sunny days. The eastern slopes of the sierras experience the highest precipitation: usually about , with some spots averaging up to which fall exclusively in the form of very heavy thunderstorms in the summer. Snowfall occurs more frequently in the sierras, but is rarely heavy due to the dryness of the air. The weather in the Pampa de Achala is very variable because of the high altitude: generally speaking, the strong radiation provides pleasant summer afternoons, but temperatures at night can be very cold. Frost can happen throughout the year, and winters are extremely dry with nights well below . Temperatures well under have been recorded, and snowfall is very common but in small quantities due to the lack of precipitation during the colder months. Summer thunderstorms can be very violent, bringing large hail, frequent lightning and high winds. The region of Traslasierra is known for its markedly warmer climate: summer temperatures often reach well over and nights are often very warm. Fall arrives later than elsewhere, and spring arrives earlier as well. Winters are pleasant, with common light frost followed by very pleasant afternoons reaching about . Precipitation is even more seasonal than in the rest of the province, falling exclusively in the summer, and reaching a total of . The warmer climate is excellent for the production of Mediterranean agricultural products such as figs, olives and grapes. The extreme northern and northwestern areas of the province are located on the transition between the temperate Pampa and the subtropical Gran Chaco: summers are consistently longer and warmer than in other areas, and extremes of are more frequent. Winters are shorter, with night temperatures similar to those further south, but with warmer days. This is the most drought-prone area of the province, with rainfall as little as annually. == Economy == Known nationally for its rich agriculture and industries such as motor vehicles and food processing, Córdoba also enjoys a vigorous services sector. The State Military Industries complex, 1950. Industry in Córdoba has benefited from a skilled work force and the province's central location. Córdoba has the second largest provincial economy in Argentina, behind only the Province of Buenos Aires. In 2013, Córdoba's GDP was estimated at 191.612 billion Pesos (about US$35.0934 billion) or, 55,075 pesos (about US$10,087) per capita.The average exchange for 1 US dollar was 5.46 Argentine pesos in 2013 according to the World Bank As in most places, the majority of GDP is produced by services (financial, educational, medical, professional, etc.). Within this sector, major players include Deloitte, Tarjeta Naranja and Bancor (financial services providers headquartered in the provincial capital), the city's various universities, a number of public and private clinics which attract patients both domestically and internationally (medical tourism), construction and engineering companies such as Roggio and Electroingenieria, media groups (La Voz del Interior is the largest Argentine newspaper outside Buenos Aires), retail firms (such as Grupo Dinosaurio) and a large number of small partnerships operating in accounting, law, architecture, etc. In the past, the province had significant call centres, but these have mostly been moved to lower-wage locations. The province is among the most visited in Argentina (mostly by domestic travelers) because of its hilly landscapes, pleasant weather, 'fun' reputation and cultural offerings. In particular, cities like Villa Carlos Paz, Villa General Belgrano, Cosquín and La Cumbrecita attract a large number of tourists. This supports a large hospitality industry with hotels, restaurants, bars and resorts. Around three million tourists, both foreign and Argentinian, visit Córdoba every year. The province has 500,000 hotel beds, including hostels, tourist farms and other types of accommodation. There are four five-star hotels,Córdoba Province Official Hotel List of which three are located in Córdoba City (Sheraton Cordoba Hotel, Holiday Inn, Interplaza), and one on the hills at Punilla Valley (El Castillo). Important festivities include the Cosquín National Folk Music Festival, and the Jesús María Folk and Taming Festivals. Call centers flourished in the province in the past, but have mostly been moved to lower- wage location. They were instead replaced by service centers from technology companies, starting with Motorola several years ago, and many of these have evolved into software and technology development centers. Current players in that industry include Intel, Mercado Libre, Santex, Globant and a vast (and growing) number of small, specialized providers which have organized under the banner of the \\"Cordoba Technology Cluster\\". The capital city has been named one of Latin America's major startup ecosystems, with several active angel investors, incubators and a well-educated talent pool supported by local universities. The installation of the Fábrica Militar de Aviones in 1927, and subsequent state-owned industries (like locomotive and train manufacturing) established Córdoba among the most important industrial centers in Argentina; the facility was purchased by Lockheed Martin in 1995 and has practically ceased production. Beginning around 1955, foreign investment in Córdoba's automotive, agricultural machinery and food processing industries further added to its industrial profile. Currently, Renault and FIAT produce cars in the provincial capital, with additional investments underway from Nissan, Renault and Mercedes-Benz to jointly produce a pickup truck starting in 2017–2018. Volkswagen operates a large manufacturing facility which produces and exports gearboxes. In total, 250 manufacturers of either motor vehicles or auto parts operate in Córdoba, making it Argentina's \\"motor province.\\" Several facilities produce agricultural machinery (tractors, harvesters, etc.) - these are often located in small and medium cities outside the capital. Chemical manufacturing is centered around Rio Tercero. Food processing is another strength of the province, with the multinational candy and snack manufacturer Grupo Arcor headquartered in Arroyito, and one of the largest oil producers in the world (Aceitera General Deheza, or AGD) headquartered in General Deheza. The cities of Villa Maria and San Francisco are major cheese production centers, while Oncativo and Colonia Caroya are known for the production of sausages and Villa General Belgrano for its beer. Historically, cheap, sweet wine was produced in the north of the province; in the last decade a number of more sophisticated wineries have found that the province has locations with excellent climate and soil for wine production (especially in hilly areas). Industry represents 17% of the province's income, and the energy production that supports it is based mainly on 15 hydroelectric dams (2.35 billion kW/hours a year), and the Embalse nuclear power plant (600 MWe of capacity, about 2 billion kWh, yearly). Agriculture and livestock provide 10% of the province's output,Prospecting Argentina well above the national average. The agriculture is centered on soybeans, wheat and maize, and other cereals. Cattle and sheep enjoy the grass of Córdoba's green hills. The province provides the nation with 15% of its beef production and 28% of its dairy output. Mining includes many different minerals, and construction material such as marble and lime. Uranium is also extracted to feed Argentina's three atomic plants. Córdoba is connected by rail with Buenos Aires, Rosario, Mendoza and Tucumán. The Ingeniero Aeronáutico Ambrosio L.V. Taravella International Airport, known as Pajas Blancas, handles international and domestic air traffic, with several daily flights to Buenos Aires and some daily flights to Santiago de Chile, Mendoza, Bariloche, Rosario, Sao Paulo, Panama City, Rio de Janeiro and Lima. Aerolineas Argentinas operates direct flights to Miami twice a week since 2015, and Avianca has obtained authorization to fly to Bogota. == Government == Provincial Legislature Córdoba has a unicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage. Until December 2001, the legislature was bicameral (a Chamber of Deputies and a Senate), but following the 2001 constitutional reform, this division was abolished. The unified legislature is made up of 70 members: 26 elected to represent each of the provincial departments, and 44 elected by the people of the province as a whole and assigned by a proportional system.Constitution of the Province of Córdoba (14 September 2001). Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes. The Constitution of Córdoba forms the formal law of the province. Córdoba Provincial Police The head of government is the governor, accompanied by a vice-governor who presides the legislature and may fill the governor's place in certain cases. Like the legislators, the governor and vice-governor are elected for a four-year term, and can be re-elected for one consecutive term. Córdoba has long been a bastion of the centrist Radical Civic Union, but in 1999 the Justicialist José Manuel de la Sota was elected governor, succeeded by fellow Peronist Juan Schiaretti in 2007. In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Córdoba Provincial Police. == Political divisions == Jesuit Estancia in Alta Gracia Villa María The province is divided in 26 regions or departments () here listed with their regional capitals.

It is written by Victor Levin and Matthew Weiner, and directed by Michael Uppendahl. It originally aired on the AMC channel in the United States on May 20, 2012. The episode starts on Pearl Harbor Day (December 7) 1966. Harry Crane tries to help out old friend Paul Kinsey, who has fallen on hard times and become involved with Hare Krishna and a bohemian devotee girlfriend. Lane Pryce resorts to desperation and subterfuge while trying to solve his own cash problems. Don and Joan commiserate with each other over drinks after Joan is served divorce papers. Following their conversation, Don's interest in his work is re-ignited, as he dedicates himself to landing the Jaguar account. While the episode was well-received, it was the lowest-rated episode of Mad Men since the penultimate episode of the third season. This episode also marks the first appearance of Paul Kinsey since the third season's finale \\"Shut the Door. Have a Seat\\". ==Plot== Lane Pryce’s attorney abroad instructs him to wire £2,900 (US $8,000) to England to cover back taxes within two days. Lane (Jared Harris) worries he cannot come up with the money. Harry (Rich Sommer) schedules coffee with Paul Kinsey (Michael Gladis), then reports a strong first-quarter outlook to Lane but warns that actual commitments from clients are still uncertain. Lane visits the firm’s bank manager and convinces him to authorize a $50,000 credit extension. Pete (Vincent Kartheiser) tells Don (Jon Hamm) and Roger (John Slattery) that Edwin Baker has been fired from Jaguar and their firm is back in contention for the account. Presentations will be in mid-January. Don comments on it being a lot of work, to which an annoyed Pete replies that Don \\"may have to work past 5:30\\". Paul, wearing a robe and sporting a shaved head, greets Harry at a Hare Krishna gathering. He introduces his friend Lakshmi (Anna Wood), who convinces Harry to join them in a group chant. In a taxi after the gathering, Paul admits to Harry that he loves Lakshmi but the Krishna movement does not make him happy. Paul later hands Harry a spec script he wrote for Star Trek entitled \\"The Negron Complex\\" and asks Harry to pass it along to NBC. Hesitant, Harry agrees and later asks Peggy (Elisabeth Moss) for her opinion on Paul’s script, which they agree is awful. She advises him to tell Paul the truth--that he can't write--but Harry is clearly reluctant. Lane calls a partners meeting to announce they can hand out Christmas bonuses thanks to a $50,000 surplus; however, Don recommends waiting until the Christmas party. Pete agrees, explaining the Jaguar announcement will be a sufficient morale boost until then; this gets no response from anyone, frustrating Pete. In Joan's (Christina Hendricks) office, a drunken Roger says he wants to financially support her and Kevin. She refuses, claiming the child would be better off without Roger’s involvement. Megan (Jessica Paré) and Don watch the play America Hurrah, in which a character rants against TV advertisements. After the play, they argue about its negative portrayal of advertising. Lane sneaks into the office after hours and forges Don's signature on a $7,500 check written out to himself. The next day, he assures his attorney that the funds are available, but hangs up when the attorney mentions his fee. Pete asks Don to test drive a Jaguar for research purposes. Don agrees but declines Pete’s suggestion to bring Megan. Pete is again annoyed that no one seems interested in the fact that he has put them in the running for Jaguar. Lakshmi shows up at the firm and seduces Harry in his office. He resists but gives in when she assures him that the movement allows it. Afterward, Lakshmi reveals that Paul is the movement's best recruiter and, subtly blackmailing Harry over what just happened, she tells Harry to stay away or he might turn Paul into a \\"gross materialist.\\" Joan is summoned to reception for a signature, but instead receives divorce papers from a process server. She loses her temper with Meredith, the receptionist, who had let the process server in, and smashes the model Mohawk airplane on Meredith's desk. Don leads her out of the office and takes her to a Jaguar showroom where they pretend to be a couple looking for a new car. Don offers the salesman a $6,000 deposit to let them test-drive an XK-E alone. At a bar, Joan reminisces about the days when, if she was called to reception, it was to receive flowers from various suitors. Don admits that, upon first sight of her, he thought she was dating Aly Khan. She replies that her mother raised her to be admired, and then asks why Don never showed interest in her. He admits he was afraid of her, and that Burt Peterson had told him she was the one person in the agency he shouldn't cross. They discuss starting over and flirt. He points out a man at the other end of the bar who seems interested in her and she guesses the man has a wife. When he's ready to leave, Don offers to return the Jaguar by himself, slipping Joan some \\"mad money\\" in case it doesn’t work out with the other man, and advising her to stand over by the jukebox: \\"That was a pretty good look before.\\" Alone later in the Jaguar, Don furiously shifts gears and accelerates. The next day, Joan is delivered flowers from \\"Ali Khan,\\" with a note stating that her mother did a good job. Don arrives home drunk and finds an angry Megan at the dinner table. She throws her plate against the wall and asks where he’s been. She yells that she has sat waiting for someone who does not care about anybody. She orders him to sit at the table and eat. Rebecca (Embeth Davidtz) tells Lane she wants to visit England for Christmas. He claims the office needs him after Jaguar has renewed interest in the firm and he does not want to spend another Christmas alone. Harry tells Paul that his business connection liked the script but passed on it, even though he didn't really show it to NBC. He gives Paul $500 and a ticket to Los Angeles, urging him to leave the Krishnas and start over. Paul hugs him, saying that Harry was the first person to do anything for him. At the office, Pete informs the partners that Mohawk Airlines is suspending their advertising budget due to a machinist strike. When Lane protests cutting the bonuses entirely, the other partners agree to give bonuses only to the staff and defer their own. In the conference room, the partners inform the employees about Mohawk, Jaguar and the bonuses, only the last of which gets a response after Roger makes it clear that the employees are getting bonuses and the partners aren't. Don ends the meeting with a rally, saying that every Madison Avenue agency is defined by their first automobile client, and that when they obtain the Jaguar account, the world will know about SCDP. The room erupts in applause; Lane, however, is visibly uneasy as everyone files out. ==Production== \\"Christmas Waltz\\" was written by Victor Levin and Matthew Weiner and directed by Michael Uppendahl. Of his character, Lane Pryce, Jared Harris said that \\"He is learning to behave the way the others behave. Your ego and your self-esteem is wrapped up in saying 'this is my area of expertise and I'll take care of it and don't you worry about it.\\" Jon Hamm, elaborating on Don's motivation for the ending speech, said, \\"What drives him to that speech is part of his gradual creative reawakening and reinvigorating and really wanting to pay penance for writing the letter, and losing Lucky Strike, and trying to come through for people. ==ReceptionCritical reception=== The episode was well-received by television journalists, with many praising the chemistry between Christina Hendricks and Jon Hamm. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- grade, adding that \\"'Christmas Waltz' sees the characters confronting materialism and consumerism itself, in a handful of separate plots. (Also, Lane Pryce continues to have the world’s most depressing adventures.) Of course, one could argue the whole show is about people realizing that having something isn't going to make them happy. That's true, more or less, but 'Christmas Waltz' was damn direct about it at times.\\" Tim Goodman called the episode \\"thoroughly entertaining\\" and pointed to the episode's \\"theme of elusive happiness\\", but expressed worry about how the series will wrap up several ongoing story threads involving Lane Pryce's financial woes, the Draper marriage, and the Betty Francis arc within the next three episodes. Alan Sepinwall of Hitfix praised the storylines involving Don and Joan's bond and Paul's return, but called Lane's journey the \\"sketchiest of the week, in the same way that his infatuation with the woman in the wallet was the one misstep in the season premiere.\\" ===Ratings=== \\"Christmas Waltz\\" was watched by 1.92 million viewers and received an adult 18-49 rating of 0.6, marking the lowest numbers for the series since the third season. ===Awards=== \\"Christmas Waltz\\" was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Makeup for a Single-Camera Series (Non-Prosthetic). ==References *\\"Christmas Waltz\\" at AMC * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Mad Men (season 5) episodes ","title":"Christmas Waltz (Mad Men)"},{"id":"35894263","text":"Tomo Riba (July 1934, Arunachal Pradesh, India - 2000) was an Indian politician.

He was part of American 4 × 400 m relay teams that won gold medals at the 1995 Summer Universiade and 1999 IAAF World Indoor Championships, setting a world indoor record in 1999. ==Early life and family== Morris was one of five children born to Frankie Morris. He has one sister and three brothers. His wife's name is Kim, and he has six children. Morris attended Russellville High School in Russellville, Kentucky. At , he was told he was too small to play football, but he began earning playing time as a sophomore following an injury to another player. He was named a Blue Chip All-American in football three times. Playing tailback, he was the scoring leader on Russellville's 1990 team that won the Class A state championship. He also competed on the track and field team, winning state titles in the 400 m and the 4 × 400 m relay. ==College career== Morris graduated from high school in 1991. Despite being recruited by traditional football powerhouses Michigan and Penn State, he followed a high school teammate to Hutchinson Community College in Hutchinson, Kansas. In his second week at the school, he suffered an ankle injury. Soon after, his friend left Hutchinson, and Morris never played in a game for the school. He continued running track and was named a Junior College All- American, earning him a scholarship to the University of Iowa. Attracted by the fact that the school's head track coach and one assistant coach were both African-Americans like himself, Morris enrolled at Iowa in the spring 1994 semester. Although he considered trying out for the football team, he decided to stick with track and twice won the 200 m at the Big Ten outdoor championships. He also won the 400 m once and was twice a member of the championship 4 × 400 m relay team. One year, he won the 400 m, but was disqualified. At the 1995 World University Games, Morris and his teammates broke the Games record in the 4 × 400 m relay with a time of 3:00.40. In 1994 and 1996, Morris was named an NCAA Division I All-American in the 4 × 400 m relay and in 1995, he was an All-American in the 400 m. At the team's awards banquet in 1995, Morris was named most valuable team member, most outstanding sprinter, most improved member, and shared the most inspirational award with his relay teammates. He graduated in summer 1996 with a bachelor's degree in art history. ==International career== After graduation, Morris moved to Iowa City, Iowa, where he worked as a cook and a janitor while training for a career as a professional athlete. He did not hire a coach, but in 2001, he was reported to run the 40-yard dash in 4.1 seconds and bench press . He qualified to compete at both the indoor and outdoor U.S. National Championships eight times. In 1996 and 2000, he participated in the United States Olympic Trials. At the 1999 World Indoor Championships, he, Dameon Johnson, Deon Minor, and Milton Campbell formed a 4 × 400 m relay team that set a world record, completing the race in 3:02.83. The team received $60,000 for the feat. The record was broken in 2015. Despite his success, Morris told The Gazette in 1999, \\"I hate track. I'm doing it because I can do it. I love football more than anything.\\" That year, he joined the semi-professional Iowa Tractors for their inaugural season in the South Central Football League, playing wide receiver, running back and returning punts and kickoffs. After a successful stint with the Tractors, he tried out for the National Football League's Carolina Panthers, but was hampered by a knee injury. ==References== Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:American male sprinters Category:University of Iowa alumni Category:People from Russellville, Kentucky Category:Universiade medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Universiade gold medalists for the United States Category:World Athletics Indoor Championships winners Category:Medalists at the 1995 Summer Universiade ","title":"Andre Morris"},{"id":"35894301","text":"The Louisville Xtreme are an indoor football team based in Louisville, Kentucky.

Midway through the 2014 CIFL season, the league removed the team's membership the Xtreme suspended operations.

In 2020, the Xtreme were added to the American Arena League (AAL) but cancelled its season on March 13 before playing a game citing the COVID-19 pandemic. After the cancellation of the 2020 season, the Xtreme were announced to be joining the National Arena League for 2021. The Xtreme were the first indoor football team in the Louisville area since the Louisville Fire, a member of af2, folded in 2008. The co-owners of the Xtreme are Victor Cole, Chris Redman, and Mario Urrutia. The Xtreme played their home games at Freedom Hall in Louisville, but was suspended by the league when Urrutia abandoned the team to join the Winnipeg Blue Bombers midseason. ==HistoryCIFL: 2013–2014=== The Xtreme was organized in 2012 when Victor Cole and five other partners decided to use the money they had saved up from their tours in Afghanistan. In 2012, the Xtreme played a preseason exhibition game against the Evansville Rage of the Continental Indoor Football League (CIFL), losing 26–56. After the 2012 CIFL season, the Xtreme played another exhibition game against the CIFL's Indianapolis Enforcers, where the Xtreme defeated the Enforcers 20–16. In July 2012, the Xtreme announced that they would be playing at Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky, and had officially joined the CIFL for the 2013 season.

The team made it to the championship game, where they lost to the Toledo Thunder 7–6. The team went dormant until it updated its team name to Louisville Xtreme in 2017. It then began to pursue joining a league in 2019 and played a game against the Indianapolis Enforcers, who had become a member on the American Arena League (AAL), and lost 40–6. The Xtreme were then accepted as an expansion team in the AAL for the 2020 season and named Mark Stoute head coach.

Afonso II had been forced off the throne by the House of Kinlaza, and had set up Kimpanzu's powerbase in the mountainous Nkondo.

He fled to Lemba to start continue his reign and to fight against Kimpanzu rule. ==Rule and Deposition== The da Silvas, the ruling house of Soyo, were determined to replace the king with a Kimpanzu, as they hoped he would be easier to control, considering the alliance between Soyo and the house. However even amongst the nobles of Kimpanzu were starting to resent the intervention of Soyo in Kongo affairs.

Earth, Water, Fire: An Ecological Profile of Lanark County. General Store Publishing House, Renfrew, Ontario. 73 p. p. 55. Fens are a relatively rare wetland habitat in the region of Lanark County; they can occur on either marble or limestone bedrock. White lake has a granite dome along its north shore, while it spreads over marble bedrock to the south. A number of calcareous fens have developed along the south shore. The largest of these has developed in a long narrow arm of the lake, where it stretches for nearly two kilometers and covers 90 ha.Reddoch, J.M. 1984. White Lake Fen. Trail and Landscape 18(3): 134-141. This fen has large areas of sedge mat dominated by wooly sedge (Carex lasiocarpa). Two of the unusual plants there are the orchids Pogonia ophioglossoides (see upper photo) and Calopogon tuberosus.Reddoch, J. and Reddoch, A. (1997). The Orchids in the Ottawa District.

Thereafter he studied for a few weeks at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta but interrupted his education to enter the United States Navy. On his discharge in 1946, he returned to Georgia Tech and completed his formal education in 1949 in the field of industrial management. At Tech, he was a member and officer of Sigma Chi fraternity. During the Korean War, Patton accepted a commission in the newly organized United States Air Force. He flew a hundred combat missions in Korea before he was discharged in 1951 and returned to the United States. Patton made his living in banking, real estate and hotel development. His Patton and Associates engaged in the sale of waste systems and equipment. He also started the Cobb Bank and Trust Company and the Marriott at Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra in northeastern Florida. In later years, he managed properties in Atlanta, Augusta, and Albany, Georgia. In 1956, he joined with others in the Northside to create the Cherokee Town and Country Club, of which he served as the president in 1970. Patton was also active in the Young Men's Christian Association and worked to build a \\"Y\\" facility to the Northside of Atlanta. Patton was chairman of the Cobb County Chamber of Commerce and helped to establish the Georgia International Convention Center. He served on committees with the 1996 Olympic Games and Paralympics as well as Super Bowl XXVIII. For a time, he was the chairman of the Atlanta Convention and Visitors' Center Bureau. ==Republican politics== Patton won the first ever Republican primary for the U.S. Senate held in the summer of 1968. That fall he was soundly defeated by the Democrat Herman Talmadge. Patton received 256,796 votes (22.5 percent) to Talmadge's 885,103 (77.3 percent). Patton was the first Republican in Georgia to run for the U.S. Senate since the Reconstruction era.Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections, p. 1441 Patton's defeat was particularly disappointing in that his party's gubernatorial nominee in 1966, Howard Callaway, had actually outpolled the Democratic choice in the general election, Lester Maddox, but had fallen short of the required popular majority. The state legislature at that point chose Maddox to serve as governor from 1967 to 1971.\\"The Frustration of Opportunity: Georgia Republicans and the Election of 1966\\" Atlanta History: A Journal of Georgia and the South, Vol. XXXI (Winter 1987-1988), pp. 46-47 Thereafter, Patton rebounded to win a seat in the Georgia State Senate and served from 1969 to 1970 from northern Fulton County. At the time his party held relatively few seats in the chamber, but Patton lived to see a dominant GOP majority in the Georgia Senate. Patton met with each Republican U.S. President from Dwight D. Eisenhower to George W. Bush while they were in Georgia on other business. Twelve years afterwards, Senator Talmadge was unseated by Mack Mattingly, who became the first Republican U.S. Senator from Georgia since Reconstruction though he served only one term from 1981 to 1987. Robert Hall, former president of the Georgia Tech Alumni Association and a former Rotary International district governor, said that Patton's \\"actions followed his beliefs. He was leading the way when being a Republican politician wasn't the thing to do. \\"He didn't mind standing out. You always knew where Earl was and what he stood for.\\" ==Family and death== Patton and his wife, the former Mary Louise Morris, whom he married on March 19, 1949, had four children: Thomas Earl Patton (born 1952), Richard Morris Patton (born 1954), Louise Patton Pritchard (born 1955), and Lorena Hall Patton (born 1960). Patton died on April 28, 2011 when a tornado struck his second home on Lake Burton in Rabun County. Before his death, Patton had retorted on several occasions that he enjoyed his second home so much that he hoped he was there at the time of his own death. Memorial services were held at the Peachtree Presbyterian Church in Atlanta, of which he was a longtime active member. A resolution of the Georgia Senate describes Patton, accordingly: \\"a person of magnanimous strengths with an unimpeachable reputation for integrity, intelligence, fairness, and kindness and, by the example he made of his life, he made this world a better place in which to live.\\" ==References== - Category:1927 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Georgia (U.S. state) state senators Category:American Presbyterians Category:Georgia (U.S. state) Republicans Category:Businesspeople from Atlanta Category:Georgia Tech alumni Category:American naval personnel of World War II Category:American air force personnel of the Korean War Category:United States Navy sailors Category:United States Air Force officers Category:Natural disaster deaths in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Deaths in tornadoes ","title":"E.

He established for each diocese a visitor who was aided by four majors and a secretary. The bishop received the religious when they took the habit and made their profession, and the brothers in a diocese met together once a year. Saint-Sabine gave the congregation a collection of statutes which regulated their mode of life. The first bishops to make these statutes obligatory in their dioceses were the Bishop of Metz (1633), and the Bishop of Cambrai (1634). Brother Jean-Baptiste carried this reform into the Dioceses of Vienne, Lyons, Geneva, Le Puy, and Langres. The Bishop of Langres, Louis-Armand de Simiane de Gardes, added in 1680, for the hermits in his diocese, several ordinances to those of Saint-Sabine. He established four visitors, one for each division of the diocese and the brothers wore a white habit to distinguish them from vagrant and lax hermits. Brother Jean-Baptiste went to the Diocese of Angers to found the hermitage of Gardelles and died there 24 December 1691. ==NotesReferences== * ==External links== * Category:Catholic hermit orders Category:Religious organizations established in the 1630s Category:1630s establishments in France ","title":"Hermits of St. John the Baptist"},{"id":"35894697","text":"Chris Jones (born October 8, 1973) is an American former sprinter. ==References== Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:American male sprinters Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1995 Pan American Games Category:Universiade medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Universiade gold medalists for the United States ","title":"Chris Jones (sprinter)"},{"id":"35894711","text":"Micheál Anthony Prendergast (c.1921 – 25 March 1998) was an Irish farmer and trader, businessman and company director, and Fine Gael politician.

The congregation of missionary priests of St. John the Baptist, called Baptistines, was founded by a Genoese, Domenico Olivieri. He began by uniting several priests with himself for the evangelization of the people of the towns and countryside. His plan of forming from this company an association the members of which should devote their time especially to missions was encouraged by Cardinal Spinola and the scheme afterwards received the approbation of Pope Benedict XIV. The pope confirmed the new congregation in his Brief of 23 September 1755, and placed it under the control of the Cardinal Prefect of the Propaganda. The institute had a house and an oratory at Rome near the church of St. Isidoro, and the members held missions in the different churches of the city and in the surrounding countryside. As the Congregation wished to employ them in distant missions, a number of them were sent to Bulgaria, Macedonia, and China; some became bishops. Foreign missions did not absorb all their activity, for a number were employed in the service of the Church in Italy, two, Imperiali and Spinelli becoming cardinals. The only vows imposed by the founder were those of continuance in the congregation and readiness to go to missions to which the members should be sent by the Congregation. Olivieri died at Genoa on 13 June 1766.

The Baptistines, or Hermit Sisters of St. John the Baptist, had as their founder Giovanna Maria Baptista Solimani. In 1730, when she was 42 years old, she gathered her first companions together at Moneglia, not far from Genoa. The congregation intended to lead a life of penitence. All the choir sisters added to their names in religion that of Baptista in honour of their model, John the Baptist. A Capuchin by the name of Athanasius aided them by his advice during the drawing up of their constitutions. Soon after they came under the direction of a priest named Olivieri. Shortly after taking Olivieri as their director, the foundress went to Rome and with the aid of the Barnabite Mario Maccabei obtained the approbation of Pope Benedict XIV in 1744. Two years later, on 20 April 1746, the Archbishop of Genoa received the religious profession of Giovanna Solimani and her twelve companions. Soon after, Solimani was elected abbess and governed the house until her death on 8 April 1758. In 1755 the congregation sent a group to Rome which founded a convent near the church of San Nicola da Tolentino. Houses were also founded in other cities of Italy. The congregation drew its members from among the young girls and widows who were admitted into their houses as lay-sisters. Tertiaries took care of their churches and gathered the alms they needed. A rigorous cloister was observed. The sisters rose at midnight for Matins, slept in their clothes, went bare- footed, and observed continual abstinence from meat. Their whole life was one of extreme austerity.

They have their own rules and sense of self- righteousness. While divesting victims of their valuables one day, they come across a demonic mask which intrigues Jalan. There amid the chaos, the bandits are suddenly caught unaware by the approach of a woman who calls herself Ushna (Mylene Jampanoi) who claims to know Jalan, having seen him in her dreams and asks him to let her come along. Jalan, in spite of his companions' warnings includes the woman in their band as he is already mesmerized by her unearthly beauty and mysterious and uncanny aura. Ushna, at first becomes the group's muse and the mode of satiating Jalan's desire, but on their first encounter itself, Jalan falls in love with her and the two begin to share an insatiable passion and more than material longing for each other. Ushna knows a great deal more than the bandits about the landscape and strategic points and helps the men in more than one successful heists becoming Jalan's consort. She proves to be an excellent horse rider, riding alongside Jalan, claims to have seen the ocean, which is unseen and a subject of myth to the men. She also apparently does not have a navel which Jalan calls \\"The Centre of the Universe\\". Jalan grows increasingly dependent upon her, their love and passion ascending unscalable heights. Madly in love, they decide to find out what future has in store for them and visit an astrologer, who informs them that they are not destined to be united. Rejecting this denial, they decide to change their fate and thereby leave the realms of material thefts and direct their attention towards stealing taboo elements such as Fortune and Energy from people potentially rich in them by stealing their shadows, in the attempt to improve their own fate. They explore too far into stealing things \\"which they have no right to and which are not theirs\\" and divest a meditating Yogi of his power of Levitation. Jalan and Ushna unite making use of their newly acquired power, to rise in the air during the act which is witnessed by Jalan's group member Jampa La (Jampa Kalsang Tamang). This is followed by a major fallout between Jalan and the rest of the group who accuse Jalan of breaking the group's rules as they perceive Ushna to be a superhuman and hence a precious asset, which according to the rules of the group should be equally divided. This enrages Jalan who accidentally kills Jampa La in the fracas between the two which results in a final split of Jalan and Ushna with the rest, with Hak Chi (Anil Yadav) rebuking Jalan as they part ways. Meanwhile, the merchants and travelers, seek the help of Yeti (Naseeruddin Shah), a mysterious wise man and the local protector, for protection against Jalan's group. Yeti seems to recognize Ushna at once from the description given by the victims and immediately sets out for the pair of them with his three bounty hunters. Ushna and Jalan make a narrow escape, until finally they are outsmarted by Yeti and his men. Ushna manages to escape on horseback and Jalan falls into the river. Later, Yeti is confronted by Ushna in his tent who questions him of Jalan's whereabouts. Yeti advises her to go back to where she came from as she can never unite with Jalan because of what she is. Ushna rejects this denial a second time saying she loves him too much and that she never does what she is supposed to and vanishes from sight as Yeti begins to gather his Chöd equipments to capture her. After this short separation, Ushna succeeds in finding Jalan at a monastery recovering from his wounds. The two set off for another monastery Jalan has heard of during his stay at the former one, where the Yogi prepares the Elixir of life for immortality by extracting the breath out of his pupils. Ushna is a bit reluctant and wishes to spend their lives in their natural spans together at the Valley of Flowers, where nobody could separate them. They however manage to steal the Elixir and consume it, preserving some for \\"days to come\\". The unfortunate lovers are confronted by Yeti early next morning direct from their sleep and Jalan in his pride of them attaining immortality shoots Ushna to make a display of it and Ushna in spite of having taken the Elixir is killed. Jalan is rebuked by Yeti for having tampered with things they ought not have. Now bereaved from his soulmate, Jalan is doomed to a vain life of immortality. Then follows a transition of two centuries into the modern times in Tokyo. The shifting of landscapes and ages is depicted by the famous Time-Walk scene as Jalan's feet are shown to traverse diverse landscapes from rocky wildernesses to blooming pastures to war ridden lands strewn with havoc to modern metalled roads, accompanied by sounds describing the various ages in time. In Japan, Jalan goes by the identity Jalan Otsal, the controversial Indian doctor who is a legalized practitioner of euthanasia and owner of the firm Valley of Flowers Corporation. He is despised by the people of the city and is stalked everywhere by protesters demanding him to leave Japan and leave death to Nature. Jalan creates news again by jumping from the 62-storey and yet surviving without even a scar, which is telecast live in the local news channels. Sayuri (Eri), the reincarnation of Ushna in this age, who is a singer at a pub is stopped during a performance by this telecast going on in the pub's television and she immediately rushes to the Police Station to rescue Jalan. They board a subway train where she tells Jalan that she has been serving her Karma ever since, this is her fifth reincarnation and that she has remembered him in each one of them, right from her birth, with the pain of separation and her aeonian longing living on with her soul and finally now she can't stand it anymore. Jalan and Sayuri unite in the empty train and rush to a temple where he gives her the Elixir he had preserved earlier. In the morning they wake up to find Yeti who reminds them of the Laws of Karma and Impermanence and of the Buddha, \\"the one who can turn conflict into collaboration\\" and gives Jalan the symbolic White Flower. Sayuri starts to flee taking Jalan with her but they are hit by a flower delivery truck. This time Jalan is killed and his body is shown lying amid the flowers fallen from the truck. Sayuri rushes to Yeti in anguish and demands to know why he did this when he had promised her more time with Jalan. Yeti consoles her saying that true love lies in sacrifice. He says that he is just carrying out his duty to restore the balance. Sayuri breaks down at his feet and slowly dissolves in a sea of fumes. Yeti performs the symbolic Chöd rituals of parting by playing the Damaru and blowing the Kangling. He then retrieves the Demon mask which Jalan had found earlier in the movie when Ushna had appeared, from where Sayuri dissolved into fumes. ==Soundtrack== Track Listing 1 Ushna and Jalan (2:50) 2 The journey (1:44) 3 Ushna (2:59) 4 The Search (0:59) 5 Yeti (3:31) 6 Mountain Song (1:51) 7 The Gang (2:10) 8 The Chase (2:17) 9 Center of the Universe (2:13) 10 Nothing Lasts Forever (1:08) 11 Looking for Jalan (4:29) 12 Valley of Silence (2:56) 13 Mystery (2:03)10) 14 Demon's Hunt (1:10) 15 Love and Longing (1:13) 16 Not a Good Omen (1:35) 17 Together Again (2:18) 18 Travelling Beyond (1:08) 19 Magic Shadows (3:02) 20 Love Theme (5:08) 21 Bardo: Book of the Dead (3:33) 22 Ocean in the Bottle (5:19) 23 Valley of Flowers (End Title) (1:20) Total Duration: 56:56 ==Cast== * Milind Soman : Jalan * Mylène Jampanoï : Ushna * Naseeruddin Shah : Yeti * Eri : Sayuri * Kelsang Jampa Tamang : Jampa La * Anil Yadav : Hak Chi ==See also== * Christy Chung * Milarepa * Samsara * Shawn Ku ==External links== * Official site * Category:2006 films Category:2000s fantasy drama films Category:2000s romantic fantasy films Category:Films about Buddhism Category:Films about Tibet Category:Films based on Belgian novels Category:Films based on French novels Category:French fantasy drama films Category:French romantic fantasy films Category:German fantasy drama films Category:German films Category:German romance films Category:Indian films Category:Indian fantasy drama films Category:Indian romantic fantasy films Category:Japanese drama films Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese fantasy drama films Category:Japanese romance films Category:Swiss drama films Category:Swiss films Category:French films Category:Tibetan-language films Category:2006 directorial debut films Category:2006 drama films ","title":"Valley of Flowers (film)"},{"id":"35894765","text":"Chamar (, also Romanized as Chāmār) is a village in Bandan Rural District, in the Central District of Nehbandan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

Christ Church Lille is part of the Church of England, Diocese of Europe. ==Location== The church, on Rue Lydéric, is within walking distance of Gare de Lille Flandres, Gare de Lille Europe and the city centre as well as tourist attractions such as the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille. ==HistoryAn English Church in Lille: early days=== There were English residents in the Lille area from the first half of the 19th century. They were workers or businessmen, and were mostly engaged in commerce or manufacturing, particularly in areas related to the busy textile industry of the time. The French Reformed Church looked after their spiritual needs, and it was not until the middle of the century that services were held in English, mainly by a certain W. B. Edwards and other lay people. There is a brass memorial plate to the memory of Edwards and his wife, and the brass lectern was also given in his name. For the first time, services were held by an ordained minister from 1848-1857 and a memorial window to Reverend W. Meston can be seen in the church vestry. ===A permanent home=== Services were held in different rooms not only in Lille but also in Croix and Armentières, but by 1860, there was the first proposal for a permanent place of worship. A plot of land originally belonging to the military and ceded to the town of Lille was given over for the building of an Anglican church. The cost of building the church was to be born entirely by the British community in Lille and once complete, although the building would belong to the town, it would be destined exclusively and in perpetuity for the usage of the Anglican church, in the charge of an Anglican minister. The church was built in a modern Gothic style, but based on 13th century French Gothic – the capitals of the front door columns are good examples of this style. The East end of the church is however in the form of a half octagon, a compromise between the usual English square and the French semicircle. ===Improvements=== The church hall beneath the church was fitted up and was used not only for the Sunday school and various church gatherings, but also by the British Institute, formed in 1868 to provide a library and entertainments for British Residents. The harmonium was replaced by an organ, which originally ran on water power. This generally worked well, but on occasions when the water power failed, so did the organ. Afterwards, thanks to generous donations and subscriptions, a new and “superior” organ was installed in an organ chamber on the south side of the chancel, and removed from its original position next to the west door. The ground around the church was paved: at the time, the church was entirely free-standing. The original gutters can still be seen in the present covered passage leading to the lavatories, which were not added until much later. ===The Great War=== On 13 October 1914, after a siege and heavy bombardment, Lille was occupied and came under German administration. The Lillois were cut off from the rest of France: only 25 km from the front, it became a garrison town for the German army. Newspapers, cafés and the theatre were all renamed, and clocks and watches had to be set to Berlin time, one hour ahead. The occupation lasted 4 years and 4 days. There were restrictions of all sorts, and extreme food shortages leading to malnutrition. But all through this time, the Reverend D. Moore refused to leave, and held services every Sunday. The marble tablet and honour roll bear witness to these years. ===The Inter-war years=== Bomb damage, broken stained glass windows and a leaky roof were all repaired or replaced during this time; electric light was installed and a new heating system too. It was also decided to repair the hall floor and walls, build two cloakrooms and install lavatories; it was at this time that the passageway to the east side of the church was covered in. Thanks to the town hall, the roof and the stained glass windows were replaced, but all the other works were paid for by donations and fund-raising events. ===World War II=== After France and Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, a new British Expeditionary Force made its way to France. Some of the troops were billeted in and around Lille. Many of them came to Christ Church, and many to the British Institute hall beneath the church, which was used for social events as well as for the library. Older members of our congregation can remember dances and music and the excitement of meeting the soldiers when they were children. But in 1940, the battle for Lille was over and the Germans took over. Many British people were evacuated, others were interned. There was no permanent chaplain and indeed no regular services for many years, although the rural Dean and visiting priests came to Lille when the city was liberated in 1944. ===The last 70 years=== The difficulties in post-war France and England, the decline of the textile industry, together with changes in society, all had their effect. Congregations declined and for some years, there was no permanent Anglican priest in Lille; services were held less frequently. Fortunately, there were always visiting priests from Britain or other cities in France and Belgium to minister to the congregation. New life and a new era came with the appointment of a permanent priest in 1998 and Christ Church is going from strength to strength. ==References * Category:Churches in Nord (French department) Category:Buildings and structures in Lille Category:Christianity in Lille Category:Anglican church buildings in France Category:Diocese in Europe ","title":"Christ Church, Lille"},{"id":"35894995","text":"Rose Elizabeth Squire, OBE (1861-1938) was an English factory inspector at the Home Office. ==Life== Rose Squire was born in London, the daughter of William Squire, a Harley Street surgeon, and his wife Martha Wilkinson.

Cambridge University, 1998 It still regularly interfered with Kongolese affairs and invaded several times to depose kings who were not pro-Soyo. When the Soyo invaded in 1669, they overthrew Pedro III, who was a member of the House of Kinlaza and replaced him with Álvaro IX, who was a member of the more Soyo sympathetic House of Kimpanzu.Gray, Richard: \\"Black Christians & White Missionaries\\", page 38.

Rafael deposed Álvaro and took his place as Manikongo. ==Rule== After his ascension, Rafael was driven from his capital São Salvador by Soyo, who were receiving Dutch aid, and were slowly becoming as powerful as Kongo. Rafael travelled to Luanda and sought Portuguese aid, who were rivals of the Dutch at the time, to help subdue Soyo.

The Syrian conflict stoked a resurgence of sectarian violence in Lebanon, with many of Lebanon's Sunni Muslims supporting the rebels in Syria, while many of Lebanon's Shi'a Muslims supporting the Syrian government which is led by Bashar Al-Assad, whose Alawite minority is usually described as an offshoot of Shi'a Islam. Killings, unrest and sectarian kidnappings across Lebanon resulted. The conflict arose in mid-2011, seven people were killed and 59 wounded in a fight between gunmen in Tripoli. In May 2012, the conflict spread to Beirut, and later to south and east Lebanon, while the Lebanese Armed Forces deployed in north Lebanon and Beirut. As of January 2016, there had been more than 800 fatalities and almost 3,000 injuries. Among Lebanon's political blocs, the Saudi-backed anti-Syrian March 14 Alliance supports the Syrian rebels, and the Iranian-backed pro-Syrian March 8 Alliance supports the Syrian government. On 28 August 2017, the last ISIL and Tahrir al-Sham remnants withdrew from Lebanon, ending the Syrian Civil War spillover in Lebanon. ==Background== Since the Cedar Revolution in 2005 and the withdrawal of the occupying Syrian forces from the country, the Lebanese political spectrum has been divided between the anti-Syrian government 14 March alliance and the pro-Syrian government 8 March alliance. The 14 March alliance, led by the mainly Sunni Muslim Future Movement, which is allied with the Maronite Christian Lebanese Forces Party, has called for Lebanese aid to the Free Syrian Army and taking a stronger stance against the Syrian government. This has been rejected by the ruling 8 March alliance, which includes the Shia Hezbollah and allies such as the Maronite Free Patriotic Movement, among others. In August, The Jerusalem Post reported that protesters, enraged at Hezbollah's support for Syria's government, burned Hezbollah flags and images of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in several places in Syria. Pro-government protestors countered the actions by carrying posters of Nasrallah. Hezbollah states they support a process of reforms in Syria and that they are also against U.S. plots to destabilize and interfere in Syria, amid comments by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that it should be \\"abundantly clear to those who support Assad [the] 'regime' [that] its days are numbered.\\" It was reported that, \\"sales of black market weapons in Lebanon have skyrocketed in recent weeks due to demand in Syria.\\" In June 2011, clashes in the Lebanese city of Tripoli between members of the Alawite minority, loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and members of the Sunni majority left seven people dead. Future Movement MP Okab Sakr was long suspected to be involved in aiding the insurgents in the Syrian civil war. At first he denied his involvement, but admitted it when Al Akhbar published audio tapes of him making arms deals with Syrian insurgents. Sakr later claimed the tapes were edited, and that he only provided Syrians with milk and blankets. Sunni extremists from Tripoli have been flocking to Syria to join the terrorist Al-Nusra Front. Hezbollah fighters have been deployed to protect border towns inhabited by Lebanese Shias from the rebels. The Lebanese Army has attempted to disassociate itself from the conflict in Syria, and to prevent clashes within Lebanon. ==TimelineBorder incidents and clashes 2011-14=== From the inception of the violence that began in Syria as a result of the Arab Spring, the Syrian Civil War has produced and inspired a great deal of strife and unrest among armed factions. Prior to the Battle of Arsal in August 2014, the Lebanese Army has tried to keep out of it and the violence has been mostly between various factions within the country and overt Syrian involvement has been limited to airstrikes and occasional accidental incursions. ===Major battles 2014–15=== In June 2014, a joint brigade of Al- Nusra Front and ISIL militants invaded and briefly held the town of Arsal. On 2 August 2014, Al-Nusra militants raided Lebanese checkpoints and captured parts of northeastern Arsal, prompting the Lebanese Army to launch a counter- attack with Syrian air support. The Lebanese Army recaptured all of Arsal after five days of fighting with Al-Nusra and ISIL militants. A year later, in June 2015, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah claimed that Al-Nusra and ISIL had seized territory within Lebanon and that major fighting was going on between them and Hezbollah, as well as with each other. In September 2015, a senior commander of the Al-Nusra Front and eight other militants were killed in a joint-operation between the Lebanese Army and Hezbollah. ===Recapture of Lebanese territory (2017)=== By 22 June 2016, 95% of the territory once controlled by militants had been recaptured by the Lebanese Army and its allies, with only 50 km2 left under militant control. Daily clashes were ongoing mainly near the town of Arsal. On 22 September, ISIL emir Imad Yassin was arrested at the Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp. Clashes erupted between ISIL and Nusra Front in Arsal Barrens on 26 October after ISIL tried to infiltrate towards the Hamid valley. On 28 October, the Lebanese Army carried out a raid against ISIL in the Wadi Zarzour area of Jaroud 'Arsal, killing a number of militants and destroying a militant hideout. ISIL commander Ahmad Youssef Amoun was arrested along with 10 other militants on 24 November after a military operation by the Lebanese Army on a temporary headquarter of the group near Arsal. In February 2017, negotiations between Hezbollah and Saraya Ahl al-Sham began in order to install a ceasefire in the Syria–Lebanon border and for residents to return to the contest towns and villages between Hezbollah and the rebels. On 27 May 2017, Tahrir al-Sham and Saraya Ahl al- Sham clashed with ISIL in the western Qalamoun Mountains near Arsal. 33 fighters were killed from both sides. On 21 July 2017, a Syrian Army commander stated that his forces and Hezbollah had launched a joint campaign to recapture the remaining territory under militant control near the Lebanon- Syria border, attacking the outskirts of Arsal. The Lebanese Army meanwhile assumed a defensive position in Arsal. On 22 July 2017, Hezbollah officials claimed to have recaptured key points near the border, including the strategic hilltop of Dhahr al-Huwa, a former Tahrir al-Sham (al-Nusra) base. On 27 July 2017, a three-day ceasefire agreement was reached by Hezbollah with Tahrir al- Sham and Saraya Ahl al-Sham in the Lebanese portion of the Qalamoun Mountains. The agreement called for Tahrir al-Sham forces to withdraw from Lebanon to Idlib, Saraya Ahl al-Sham forces to withdraw to the eastern Qalamoun Mountains, and exchanges of prisoners from both sides. On 27 August 2017, the remaining ISIL holdouts in the western Qalamoun agreed to the ceasefire with the Lebanese Army in Lebanon and Hezbollah and the Syrian Army on the Syrian side of the border. The next day, ISIL fighters burned its headquarters in the area, and prepared to be transferred to Abu Kamal. With the ISIL withdrawal, the Lebanese government regained full control of Lebanese territory for the first time in six years. ==Deaths and injuries== In the unrest of June 2011, at least 7 deaths were reported. A further 2-3 deaths occurred during the incidents of February 2012. Between May 2012 and December 2015, violent political incidents had resulted in at least 789 fatalities and more than 2,700 injuries, mostly during the Bab al Tabbaneh-Jabal Mohsen clashes in Tripoli. In August 2014, starting with the battle of Arsal between the Lebanese Army and Sunni militants at the beginning of the month and intense fighting that included both the Syrian and Lebanese armies in and near Arsal and the Bekaa Valley at the end of the month, the fighting had reached a new and different phase. The August casualties nearly equaled half the number of the previous two years put together. 12 November 2015, bombings in Beirut killed 43 people in the deadliest event of 2015 for this conflict. The Lebanese Army stated that by June 2016, about 500 ISIL and Nusra militants had been killed and 700 captured in the border area of Lebanon and Syria.Lebanese army slowly crushing extremists near Syria border ==ReactionsDomestic political reactions=== 22 May 2012, Hezbollah deputy leader Sheikh Naim Qassem condoled Sunni Grand Mufti Mohammed Rashid Qabbani over the killings, and relayed the condolences of Hassan Nasrallah. The same day, Shadi Mawlawi, the Islamist whose arrest sparked the clashes in Tripoli, was released from custody, but Islamist protesters did not stop their sit-in protests, since they wanted 123 other Islamists freed as well. The Future Movement called for Mikati to immediately resign, claiming his cabinet had shown incapability to maintain the country's security. Lebanese Forces leader Samir Geagea accused Hezbollah of training and arming groups in Tripoli. In August 2012, Prime Minister Najib Miqati, a native of Tripoli, issued a statement saying that \\"efforts to drag Lebanon more and more into the conflict in Syria when what is required is for leaders to cooperate...to protect Lebanon from the danger\\" and urged the international community to help prevent Lebanon from being another theater in the Syrian civil war. He added: \\"The cabinet work is not a priority compared to what the country is witnessing when it comes to exposure to the Syrian crisis and attempts to transfer it to Lebanon. The country is in great danger.\\" An Nahar cited unnamed \\"western diplomatic sources\\" as stating that these incidents were the beginning of a Salafist revolution aimed at arming the uprising in Syria. Salafists in Lebanon have often voiced their support for the uprising in Syria. The 14 March alliance also accused the Syrian government of trying to drag Lebanon into its crisis. The Future Movement's former MP Mustafa Alloush said after regular weekly meeting: \\"It is actually an attempt to make of Tripoli a zone of terrorism. It also aims at striking Lebanon's northern area which has welcomed and helped out the Syrian displaced.\\" Calls by Rifaat Eid, the head of the Arab Democratic Party, for a return of the Syrian army to Tripoli to impose security in the city were rejected by Prime Minister Najib Mikati. The Syrian Civil War and its domestic impact have furthered the polarisation of Lebanese politics. The March 14 Alliance, dominated by Christian- and Sunni-based parties, is broadly sympathetic to the Syrian opposition to Bashar Al-Assad. In August, youth members of 14 March parties including Kataeb, Lebanese Forces, National Liberal Party, Future Movement and Islamic Group held a rally to demand the expulsion of the Syrian Ambassador. 8 March parties generally supported the continuation of the Assad government, but analysts believe some groups within the coalition may seek new alliances if the Assad government falls. More moderate members of the coalition in government have begun distancing themselves from the Assad government. Previously allied with Assad, the Progressive Socialist Party of Walid Jumblatt have taken an anti-Assad stance. As of 13 February 2013, more than 182,938 Syrian refugees are in Lebanon. As the number of Syrian refugees increases, the Lebanese Forces Party, the Kataeb Party, and the Free Patriotic Movement fear the country's sectarian based political system is being undermined. Other parties, such as the mostly Shia Lebanese Option Gathering and the mostly Sunni Najjadeh Party have also taken stances close to 14 March, including calling cancellation of agreements between the two countries. ===International=== * : On 21 May 2012, Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon appealed for calm after the clashes. On 22 August 2012, Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey Feltman, in a meeting of the Security Council, described the situation as \\"precarious\\" and warned that a deteriorating situation in Syria could destabilise Lebanon. * : On 23 May 2012, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there was a real threat of conflict spilling over from Syria and that it could have a very bad ending. * : On 23 May 2012, King Abdullah wrote to Lebanese President Michel Suleiman expressing concern over the recent violence in Tripoli, especially the sectarian nature of the violence. * : On 25 May 2012, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for restraint and said the U.S. was concerned the unrest in Syria would contribute instability in Lebanon. In May, Ambassador Maura Connelly met with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati to express her concern with the security situation in Tripoli and commended the government's efforts to defuse the situation. ===Other=== Bilal Saab, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, argued that Lebanon's handling of the Syrian crisis was a good sign for the domestic stability of the country and U.S. policies. He noted that while the 2007 Lebanon conflict saw a mere 450 gunmen in one refugee camp kill or wound several hundred Lebanese security forces and force the government to reduce the camp to rubble to flush them out, the Syrian war spillover was dealt with much more cleanly and efficiently, with the Lebanese Army swiftly defeating and evicting a force of several thousand Islamic State militants. In addition to noting the large improvements in troop and equipment quality over the preceding decade (partly thanks to American funding), Saab also noted that the battles solidified the legitimacy of the Lebanese Army as a defender of the country, earning it positive publicity among the country's northern regions and detracting from the influence of Hezbollah.Saab, Bilal. \\"The United States Has Not Lost Lebanon.\\" Foreign Policy.

He was known to have planned to rape and kill one woman each week. The British police had previously investigated the pair in connection with three rapes committed in England in 1974, prompting the men to travel to Ireland. They planned a series of murders and rapes, which they did by house theft. They were detained in Cork and received a two-year prison sentence for burglary. After 18 months, however, they were released and escaped British prosecution for the rape charges in England by failing to return to the U.K. and traveling through Ireland. In August 1976, in Wicklow, they repeatedly raped and then murdered Elizabeth Plunkett, 23. In September of that year, in Castlebar, they beat, raped and murdered 24-year-old Mary Duffy. On 26 September 1976, both were detained by the Gardaí and later sentenced to life imprisonment for the two murders. In December 2008, Evans underwent heart surgery, suffered a stroke and fell into a coma. Until June 2010 he remained in hospital care with caution, and then was given temporary release when doctors said he was in a vegetative state. In April 2011 he was transferred to Dublin's St. John's Hospital. He died there on 20 May 2012 at the age of 68 or 69 (sources vary).

Chapman (September 4, 1821 – December 12, 1885) was a physician in the U.S. state of Oregon who served three non-consecutive terms as mayor of Portland, Oregon. ==Early life== Chapman was born in Friendship, New York. He studied medicine and graduated from Geneva Medical College in 1846. He set up a medical practice in Cuba, New York, and after a few years, moved to Dundee, New York, where he began another practice. ==Travel to Oregon== In 1861, with the onset of the American Civil War, Chapman volunteered for service and was appointed surgeon with the 50th New York Regiment. He remained with the regiment as it moved south until 1862, when he was transferred to an overland expedition under Captain Medorem Crawford to assist emigrants to Oregon. After the expedition arrived in Portland, Oregon, in late 1862, Chapman joined James C. Hawthorne's medical practice, but Hawthorne left shortly after to run the newly established Oregon Hospital for the Insane. Chapman began a new practice with William H. Watkins. ==Mayor of Portland== In June 1867, mayor Thomas J. Holmes, who had been appointed the previous year after the resignation of Henry Failing, was elected to a full term, and then died the following morning. Judge Aaron E. Waite was first chosen by the City Council to replace Holmes, but declined due to ill health. Chapman was appointed mayor on July 31, 1867, and served until the following June, when a special election to complete Holmes' term was won by Hamilton Boyd. In the early 1870s, Chapman was appointed surgeon-general to the Oregon militia by Governor La Fayette Grover. In 1875, he sought election as mayor against incumbent Henry Failing. Chapman defeated Failing, who had been criticized for a number of his ordinances and his response to a massive 1872 fire that consumed 22 blocks of the Portland waterfront. Chapman served one two-year term, and then ran again in 1882, defeating another incumbent, David P. Thompson. ==Death== Late in 1885, Chapman suffered serious injuries after being thrown from his buggy when he drove it into a low-hanging telephone wire. A few weeks later, he suffered a stroke and died from his injuries. He is buried in Lone Fir Cemetery. ==References== Category:1821 births Category:1885 deaths Category:People from Friendship, New York Category:Mayors of Portland, Oregon Category:Oregon Democrats Category:Physicians from Portland, Oregon Category:Burials at Lone Fir Cemetery Category:Geneva Medical College alumni Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"J.

It was her first Grand Slam since winning the 2008 Australian Open and her first since major shoulder surgery which threatened to end her career four years prior. Sharapova only lost one set the entire tournament, to Klára Koukalová in the fourth round. Li Na was the defending champion, but lost in the fourth round to qualifier Yaroslava Shvedova, the first time a defending champion was defeated by a qualifier in the tournament's history. The tournament was notable for one of the biggest upsets in recent years as World No. 111 Virginie Razzano beat World No. 5 and 2002 champion Serena Williams in the first round despite Williams having two match points at 5–1 on a second set tiebreak. Razzano became only the 2nd player ranked outside the top 100 after Sun Tiantian at the 2005 China Open to defeat Williams in a main draw match.

This gives D = a + bC. When C = 1 (100% Catholic) this gives the estimated Democratic vote as a+b. When C = 0 (0% Catholic), this gives the estimated non-Catholic vote as a. For example, if the regression gives D = .22 + .45C, then the estimated Catholic vote is 67% Democratic and the non-Catholic vote is 22% Democratic.

It states that no normal modes can be both Infrared and Raman active in a molecule that possesses a centre of symmetry. This is a powerful application of group theory to vibrational spectroscopy, and allows one to easily detect the presence of this symmetry element by comparison of the IR and Raman spectra generated by the same molecule. The rule arises because in a centrosymmetric point group, IR active modes, which must transform according to the same irreducible representation generated by one of the components of the dipole moment vector (x, y or z), must be of ungerade (u) symmetry, i.e. their character under inversion is -1, while Raman active modes, which transform according to the symmetry of the polarizability tensor (product of two coordinates), must be of gerade (g) symmetry since their character under inversion is +1. Thus, in the character table there is no irreducible representation that spans both IR and Raman active modes, and so there is no overlap between the two spectra. This does not mean that a vibrational mode which is not Raman active must be IR active: in fact, it is still possible that a mode of a particular symmetry is neither Raman nor IR active. Such spectroscopically \\"silent\\" or \\"inactive\\" modes exist in molecules such as ethylene (C2H4), benzene (C6H6) and the tetrachloroplatinate ion (PtCl42−). == References == Category:Raman spectroscopy Category:Infrared spectroscopy Category:Theoretical chemistry ","title":"Rule of mutual exclusion"},{"id":"35895517","text":"JManga was an American website and international online community focused on the promotion, distribution, and monetization of digital comics (specifically manga) as well as the development of other manga related services. Founded in December 2010 and backed by the 36 publishers of the Japanese Digital Comics Association, JManga was intended to serve as a legal alternative to scanlation sites and online piracy. The site was closed in June 2013. ==Early history== JManga's arose from a strategic alliance between Crunchyroll, Inc. (an internet company specializing in streaming East Asian media) and Bitway Co., Ltd (a subsidiary of Toppan Printing and digital comic distributor) in the summer of 2010 to create the world's first legal, global online manga platform. Originally, the project was envisioned as way to explore mechanisms for economical, sustainable digitization of manga outside Japan, with the final product to be a white-label online platform for digitized manga (including manga viewer, social media integration, and a downloadable app for mobile devices) to be licensed to local publishers and distributors. As originally conceived, local distributors would have a number of choices in how to use the JManga platform, with options ranging from simply using the viewer or app to licensing the entire Crunchyroll online publishing and management suite and rebranding it with their logos and graphics. And where Crunchyroll worked as the technology partner to build the online tools for this venture, Bitway would act as liaison for the publishers of the Japanese Digital Comics Association and local publishers/distributors to help make previously unlicensed content available for those who desired more than their original content. Using its relationships with many of Japan's key publishers, Bitway would assist licensees of the Crunchyroll manga app in negotiating the rights to a digital license for desired titles - with an emphasis on publishers in the U.S. who had rights to the printed material, as manga licenses are unbundled and additional negotiations for the digital rights would be required for the same material. At the time, the business model was simply to grow the digital manga industry, allowing existing businesses - and hopefuls with enough capital - to start up a digital manga distribution company, with the partnership taking a cut of the revenues for enabling easier and faster-paced development. ==Official launch== More details about the platform became available in July 2011, at San Diego ComiCon 2011, where a panel of Japanese manga editors spoke on the state of manga worldwide, noting while the numbers of fans had increased in the last decade (as measured by attendance at conventions such as Anime Expo), sales had drastically fallen, due to a number of reasons, among them piracy, lack of licensees, and the loss of the Borders bookstore chain. Since the project was first announced, the goal had changed from enabling would-be licensees to start up distribution companies, to simply offering a legal alternative to the numerous scanlation (unauthorized translated scans of Japanese manga) websites that have popped up in recent years. The site became available in North America on August 17, 2011, receiving rather mixed reviews. Though it did launch with an interesting selection of titles that were unlikely to be licensed in English otherwise, with free access to selected works as well as an online store offering for-pay titles, and bonus content, such as interviews with manga creators, some found the available content (48 full-length works) disappointing when high prices were considered, along with seeming to fall short of plans to have 10000 titles available by 2013. As well, the site's region-locking and lack of support for mobile devices was noted by many critics, with these changes from the original vision not well received. Notably, however, the site has been responsive to criticism and suggestions posed via Twitter feed and Facebook pages, reassuring users that plans for mobile apps and global release were still on track, as well as lowering prices across the site from $8.99 to $4.99 in October 2011 in responde to user complaints - a change made permanent in November. JManga became accessible worldwide on February 28, 2012, following a social media campaign from users to remove regionlocking and make the contents of the site available to users around the world. Changes to the payment model were rolled out on June 22, 2012, with JManga adding a \\"pay as you go\\" plan and removing the distinction between JManga members and free members, allowing anyone to buy and use their points without a monthly subscription. Further, on July 13, at their panel at San Diego ComiCon 2012, native iOS and Android applications were announced for release in October 2012, with the company also unveiling the \\"Manga Translation Battle\\", a contest open to amateur and professional alike, organized in collaboration with - and sponsored by - the Japanese Ministry of Cultural Affairs. ==Terminating service== On March 13, 2013, JManga announced that it was terminating both the JManga and JManga7 services. The JManga7 subscription service had already been discontinued. JManga stopped selling points and announced that existing points would no longer be redeemable. ==See also== *Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha, a digital shōnen manga anthology published in North America by Viz Media. ==References * Category:Companies based in San Francisco Category:Companies established in 2011 Category:Manga distributors Category:Anime and manga websites Category:Internet properties established in 2011 Category:2011 establishments in California ","title":"JManga"},{"id":"35895529","text":"James Davis (born March 19, 1976) is an American former sprinter. ==References== Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:American male sprinters Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Pan American Games medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Pan American Games silver medalists for the United States Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2003 Pan American Games Category:World Athletics Indoor Championships winners ","title":"James Davis (athlete)"},{"id":"35895553","text":"Mohammadabad (, also Romanized as Moḩammadābād) is a village in Bandan Rural District, in the Central District of Nehbandan County, South Khorasan Province, Iran.

McFarlane’s defence was that as a duly enlisted member of the Royal Australian Air Force and that on the occasion in question he was on duty driving a car belonging to the Air Force, under orders from his superior officer, was thus on Air Force business. The Police Magistrate dismissed the case, ruling that D'Emden v Pedder applied. The Supreme Court of Victoria declined to hear the case, as it involved a question as to the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of the State and the Commonwealth, leaving it to be considered by the High Court under s. 40A of the Judiciary Act 1903, which at that time stated: == Issues == Three questions needed to be considered by the High Court, before the case could be reviewed:per Knox CJ #Was s. 40A a valid exercise of the legislative power of the Commonwealth? #If so, was the application to the Supreme Court to make absolute the order nisi to review a \\"cause pending in the Supreme Court\\"? #If so, did there arise in that cause a question as to the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of a State? == Decision == The High Court unanimously agreed that s. 40A was valid, and that the Court could properly deal with the appeal at hand. It also held, by 3-2, that the State road laws did apply, the majority finding that ‘a soldier is also a citizen’.per Higgins J The minority relied partly on the exclusivity of the defence power, under Constitution s 51(vi), and partly on a perception that Commonwealth personnel generally have ‘special duties, rights and immunities that are outside the scope of ordinary citizenship.'per Isaacs J The finding retained the constitutional interpretation that both levels of government could be subject to interference by the other, and that neither was absolutely immune from the other's laws. Knox CJ declared: ==Aftermath== The case had also been appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which subsequently declined to pursue the matter, declaring that \\"the basis of the appeal has disappeared, and the other questions which are raised upon it, interesting as they might prove to be, have become academic so far as this case is concerned.\\" == See also == States rights Henderson v Defence Housing Authority. ==Further reading== * ==References== Category:Intergovernmental immunity in the Australian Constitution cases Category:High Court of Australia cases Category:1925 in case law Category:1925 in Australia ","title":"Pirrie v McFarlane"},{"id":"35895794","text":"Daniel Gardano Serra (born 24 February 1984, in São Paulo) is a Brazilian auto racing driver.

Ammann (born August 12, 1936) is a pediatric immunologist and advocate known for his research on HIV transmission and his role in the development of the first successful vaccine to prevent pneumococcal infection in 1977. Ammann is the founder of Global Strategies for HIV Prevention and Clinical Professor of Pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center (UCSF).\\"The Littlest Index Case: How Pediatric Patients in San Francisco Helped Decode HIV/AIDS\\" Nairi Strauch. Stanford Journal of Public Health. Retrieved May 21, 2012. Published February 8, 2012. Retrieved May 22, 2012. == Education == Ammann was born in Brooklyn, New York to German parents, neither of whom ever finished grade school.\\"Pioneering Pediatrician Leads Charge to Cut Infant HIV Infections.\\" Jan Sluizer. Voice of America. Retrieved May 21, 2012. He graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School and attended Wheaton College in Illinois, continuing on to study medicine at New Jersey Medical School, where he received his M.D. in 1962.\\"Distinguished Alumnus/Alumna Awards\\" New Jersey College of Medicine. Retrieved May 22, 2012. Ammann later became the first pediatric immunologist at UCSF, where he served his residency in pediatrics.\\"Eminent Doctor Chooses Service Over Retirement.\\" Alice C. Chen. SF Gate. Retrieved May 21, 2012. == Research  Early research === In 1966, for the first time, Ammann and Richard E. Stiehm documented Immunoglobulin A (IgA) as the major immunoglobulin class in breastmilk, present in high concentrations in colostrum mature breastmilk. They postulated that the protection afforded to infants by breast-feeding was a result of exposure to local antibodies contained within IgA rather than absorption of maternal antibody into these infants circulation.\\"Immune globulin levels in colostrum and breast milk and serum from formula and breast-fed newborns.\\" Proc Soc Exp Biol Med, 122:1098-1100, 1966. Ammann, Stiehm and James D. Cherry identified that there are elevated levels of Immunoglobulin M (IgM) in the cord blood of newborn infants born with the congenital rubella syndrome. This was a major step forward in understanding the fetal immune response and developing diagnostic tools to differentiate between in utero infection with infectious agents such as rubella, toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus from infections acquired following birth\\"Elevated cord macroglobulins in the diagnosis of intrauterine infections.\\" NEJM, 275:971-977, 1966. In 1973, Ammann lead his research team to perform the first successful reconstitution of T-cell immunity in a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency. This was achieved through fetal thymus transplantation. This study demonstrated that the thymus holds only the potential of developing T cells and will not result in reconstitution of B cell immunity as was subsequently shown by others who utilized bone marrow transplantation, which contained multi-potential stem cells. Thymus transplantation. Permanent reconstitution of cellular immunity in a patient with sex-linked combined immunodeficiency. NEJM, 275:971-977, 1966. Working with Dr. E.R. Giblett in 1972, Ammann described the first patient with purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency in association with a unique genetic profile that included depressed T-cell immunity with normal levels of immunoglobulins. The resulting publication was listed as one of the 500 most widely cited articles in 1984. Ammann's discovery represented an essential step to understanding new treatments for immunodeficiency diseases and developing drugs that could interfere with the immune response.Giblett ER, Ammann AJ, Sandman R, Wara DW, Diamond LK. \\"Nucleoside-phosphorylase deficiency in a child with severely defective T-cell immunity and normal B-cell immunity.\\" Lancet, 1:2020-1014, 1975. === Pneumococcal vaccine === From 1971 to 1985, Ammann was director of Pediatric Immunology and Clinical Research Center at UCSF. It was during this period that Ammann performed a series of clinical trials aimed at protecting children with sickle cell anemia and the elderly from pneumococcal infection, a bacterium that causes fatal infection.

Ammann's investigations into the cause of the symptoms led him to identify two new means of transmission, in utero mother to infant and blood transfusions. This discovery changed the perception of HIV as an epidemic solely within the gay community. In 1985, Ammann left his position at UCSF in order to work with the biotechnology firm, Genentech.

Bos, circa 1915 Coenraad Valentijn Bos (7 December 18755 August 1955) was a Dutch pianist, most notably as an accompanist to singers of lieder. His peers such as Gerald Moore considered him the doyen of accompanists in his day.His name appeared in older sources as Coenraad van Bos, but that was an error; his middle name was Valentijn (also spelt Valentyn) leading to the form Coenraad V.

He studied under Julius Röntgen and at the Berlin High School for Music.Grove’s Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954, Vol. I, p. 828, BOS, Coenraad v. He decided early to become an accompanist, a field of which he made a special study. On 9 November 1896, in the presence of the composer, and still a month shy of his 21st birthday, he accompanied the Dutch baritone Anton Sistermans at the premiere of Brahms' Vier ernste Gesänge in Vienna. In 1899 he founded The Dutch Trio (Das Holländische Trio) together with his Berlin-based countrymen Jacques van Lier and Joseph Maurits van Veen. The pianotrio was active for over ten years and acquired fame throughout Europe. For many years he worked with singers such as Raimund von zur-Mühlen, Elena Gerhardt (USA tour 1920, Spanish tour 1928), Julia Culp, Frieda Hempel, Alexander Kipnis, Gervase Elwes, Ludwig Wüllner and Helen Traubel (he accompanied Traubel on a world tour in 1945–46). He appeared with the 13-year-old Yehudi Menuhin in Berlin on 23 April 1929, and they exchanged inscribed photographs of themselves in commemoration of the event (Bos's gift to Menuhin is now in the Museum of the Royal Academy of Music). He recorded lieder of Brahms, Reger, Schubert, Schumann and Wolf with Elena Gerhardt (1927–32). He figures prominently in the Hugo Wolf Society's Complete Edition 1931–38, accompanying Gerhardt, Herbert Janssen, Gerhard Hüsch, Alexandra Trianti and Elisabeth Rethberg.

First discovered in 1987, it was identified as a new mineral species in 1992 and named for Bryan M. K. C. Gatehouse (born 1932). , it is known from only one mine in South Australia. ==Description== Gatehouseite occurs as radiating or divergent groups of bladelike crystals up to 100 μm by 20 μm by 5 μm in size and as overgrowths on arsenoclasite that are up to 5 mm long. The transparent mineral can be brownish-orange or yellow in color. Gatehouseite is the phosphorus analogue of arsenoclasite. The mineral occurs in cavities in sedimentary iron and manganese deposits in association with arsenoclasite, shigaite, hematite, hausmannite, triploidite, barite, and manganoan ferroan calcite. Based on a 1977 experiment that produced triploidite, it is likely that gatehouseite formed by a reaction between hausmannite and basic phosphorus-rich fluids at low temperature and variable pH conditions. ==History== In May 1987, Glyn Francis, an employee at the Iron Monarch mine in South Australia, submitted for identification some mineral specimens from the mine to A. Pring. Very small, unidentified pale brownish orange crystals were seen in one specimen; study showed they had a formula of the type M5(XO4)2(OH)4 and contained manganese, phosphorus, and a minor quantity of arsenic. The powder X-ray diffraction pattern could not be recorded as insufficient material was available. Another specimen in the same group consisted of arsenoclasite crystals overgrown by what appeared to be its as yet undescribed phosphorus analogue. Francis later discovered more of the brownish orange crystals in sufficient quantity to obtain an X-ray diffraction pattern. This proved that the crystals and the overgrowths were the same, new mineral species. Gathehouseite was named for Bryan Michael Kenneth Cummings Gatehouse for his contributions to the study of oxides and oxysalts. The Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names recognized the mineral and approved its name in 1992 (IMA 1992-016). Due to the small size and intergrowth of the crystals, single-crystal X-ray crystallography is difficult to perform on gatehouseite. In 2011, this technique was successfully used to determine the crystal structure of the mineral. ==Distribution== The type material is housed at the South Australian Museum in Adelaide and the Museum of Victoria in Melbourne. , the Iron Monarch open cut remains the only site from which gatehouseite is known. ==Crystal structure== Gatehouseite has the space group P212121. The crystal structure consists of Mn(O, OH)6 octahedra and PO4 tetrahedra. The five manganese sites are occupied by manganese and small amounts of magnesium. The two phosphorus sites are occupied by phosphorus and small amounts of silicon and arsenic. ==ReferencesBibliography=== * * ==External links== *Images of gatehouseite from mindat.org Category:Phosphate minerals Category:Orthorhombic minerals ","title":"Gatehouseite"},{"id":"35896163","text":"Neli A'asa (born February 16, 1988) is a former American football player who played college football at the University of Utah. ==High school== Neli attended Big Rapids High School in Big Rapids, Michigan.

According to Aristophanes of Byzantium, the plot was similar to that of Sophocles' play Antigone, with three differences. The date of the play is uncertain, but there is evidence that it was written late in Euripides' career, between 420 BCE and 406 BCE. ==Plot== Sophocles' Antigone (ca. 441 BCE) told the story of how Oedipus' daughter Antigone buried the body of her brother Polynices who had led an invasion of Thebes, defying the order of her uncle Creon who was ruling Thebes. As a result, Creon condemned her to death, and although Creon rescinded the death sentence, Antigone and her lover Haemon, Creon's son, killed themselves. The extant fragments of Euripides' Antigone do not reveal much of the plot, but Aristophanes of Byzantium has written that Euripides' play differed from Sophocles' in three major ways: # Haemon was discovered with Antigone at the burial of Polynices # Haemon and Antigone married # Haemon and Antigone had a son Maeon Modern scholars interpret Aristophanes comment to indicate that Euripides' play developed along similar lines to Sophocles', except that Haemon's participation in, or at least knowledge of, Antigone's burial of Polynices led to the happy resolution of their marriage in Euripides' play instead of their deaths in Sophocles' play. One extant fragment is a plea to the god Dionysus, suggesting the possibility that Dionysus was the deus ex machina who saved Antigone and Haemon and prophesied the birth of Maeon. Several extant fragments deal with love and marriage, and John Homer Huddilston believed that this, and hint from other fragments (although some of these are now believed to be from plays other than Antigone) indicate that Antigone and Haemon were married secretly. There are two vase paintings showing scenes from an Antigone play which were historically attributed to Euripides' play, although modern scholars generally believe that they depict scenes from an Antigone play by 4th century Attic dramatist Astydamas the Younger. However, the possibility that the vases depict scenes from Euripides has not been definitively closed and even if they depict scenes from Astydamas' play they may be relevant since Astydamas may have been influenced by Euripides. The vases suggest that Heracles was the deus ex machina who saved Antigone and Haemon. A fable by Gaius Julius Hyginus is consistent with these vase paintings and was historically attributed to Euripides' play, but modern scholars believe that this too relates to Astydamas' play rather than Euripides'. Per Hyginus, Creon had delegated the task of executing Antigone to his son Haemon, not knowing that they were secretly betrothed. Haemon deceived Creon and spared Antigone, who later bore Haemon a son. The son came to Thebes as an adult, and Creon recognized him, realizing Haemon's deception. Creon refused Heracles' request to pardon Haemon, who then killed Antigone and himself. Huddilston, believing the vases and Hyginus fable to relate to Euripides' play, reconstructed the plot as follows. Maeon is already grown and has come to Thebes to participate in games. Creon recognizes him and is enraged that Haemon deceived him years earlier. He orders Antigone to appear before him, and she does so along with Haemon. Creon sentences one or both to death, when Heracles appears to intercede as a deus ex machina. In this reconstruction, the comment by Aristophanes of Byzantium does not apply to the plot of Euripides' play, but only to the background to the play. ==Date== The date for Antigone has not been definitively established. However, metrical analysis on the extant fragments, particularly the incidence of resolutions, by Cropp and Fick indicates that the play was likely written in the latter part of Euripides' life, between 420 BCE and 406 BCE. In addition, a scholiast remark indicates that another play of Euripides, Antiope, was produced after 412. However, metrical analysis of the extant fragments of Antiope indicate a much earlier date. This leaves open the possibility that the scholium erroneously referred to Antiope but meant Antigone, or originally named Antigone but this became corrupted over time. If so, that would indicate that Antigone was produced between 411 and 406 BCE. Zimmerman has suggested that the likely theme of the play involving Polynices as a traitor who was denied burial mirrored events of the Peloponnesian War in 411 BCE, which may be a further clue to the date of Antigone. ==Notable Fragments== Two lines from the prologue survive because Aristophanes held them up to ridicule in The Frogs. These lines talk about Oedipus starting out as a fortunate man, then becoming wretched. ==References== Category:Plays by Euripides Category:Lost plays Category:Theban mythology ","title":"Antigone (Euripides play)"},{"id":"35896210","text":"Dennis Veraldi was the interim CEO of the Port Authority of Allegheny County serving metropolitan Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from September 13, 2005 until June 11, 2006.http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2005/08/29/daily11.html He was formerly the longtime CEO of Pittsburgh-based Eckert Seamans lawfirm. ==References== Category:Port Authority of Allegheny County executives Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Dennis Veraldi"},{"id":"35896239","text":"Juan Curbelo (1680 - 1760) was a Spanish politician who served as the sixth and eighth mayor of San Antonio, Texas in 1737 and 1739.

Obviously they're squares and Mott, Norman Mott, is certainly not....\\" ==Plot== The story opens with its protagonist, the overweight, lazy, yet fancifully imaginative Norman Mott driving into the town of Alegre to gamble and visit his girlfriend, the zaftig, blonde Sandra Patterson, at college. He attempts to make love to Sandra but is thwarted by her sexual repression at the hands of her mother, who is a disciple of the evangelist Reverend Smiley Harley Gurrey. Between her mother’s influence and the experience of being tricked into a sham marriage as a teenager, Sandra is so apprehensive about sex that she becomes extremely flatulent every time a man makes sexual advances to her. Mott, facing the likelihood that he will soon serve a prison sentence for refusing to be drafted into the Vietnam War, borrows money from Sandra to gamble, hoping to raise the money to pay for his mentally handicapped twin brother, Paulie, to stay in a care facility while he is incarcerated. Despite his abhorrence of regular employment, after Mott loses his stake gambling at the casino, he finds work as a ticket-taker at a travelling amusement franchise, where he meets fellow hustler Frankie Pappas. The two become friends, despite Pappas’s tendency to rib Mott about his frog-like appearance (going so far as to nickname him Froggie). Mott moves into the boardinghouse where Pappas lives. Among the other residents are Dolly, the star of a “midget revue” attached to the fair (who briefly becomes Mott’s lover) and Ulla, a German war bride and “accident faker” who repeatedly flirts with Mott, though he turns her down because he hates Germans. Mott and Pappas make the majority of their money by “clipping” admission tickets at the fair (that is, selling untorn tickets a second time and keeping the money themselves), only to lose a large part of their profit when Mott, entrusted with the money, is robbed on the final night of the carnival by Sherman Buxby, a fellow employee who had previously and unsuccessfully attempted to blackmail Mott. The next morning, Mott awakes massively hung over, only to find that he and Sandra have had sex while extremely intoxicated, effectively causing her to overcome her fear. Mott spends the next year and a half in prison, represented by a single, one- paragraph letter from Mott to Sandra, in which he describes prison as comparable to working for a major corporation, except “here they don’t let you out at night.” Released early from prison for good behavior, Mott, now addicted to tranquilizer pills (“Miltowns”, also known as Meprobamate) returns to New York. He wanders around the city, finding that his family’s former apartment has become a small brothel, and visiting Pappas, who now works for the Reverend Gurrey. Pappas has gotten Gurrey to back his scheme of a “Christian Aeronautical Mission” which involves using hot air balloons to drop Bibles behind the Iron Curtain. Ulla is also present, and after sleeping with Gurrey, tries to induce Mott to murder her by making anti-Semitic remarks and (falsely) telling him that she was a guard at the Ravensbrück concentration camp, but he does not. Mott accompanies his friend Leroy Parker on a road trip through the southern US, where, as a black man and a white man travelling together, they repeatedly experience racist harassment. The two separate and Leroy proceeds to Mexico, while Mott joins Sandra’s family at their vacation home in Palm Beach, Florida. Both of Sandra’s parents are present, though they have long been divorced, as is Reverend Gurrey. While Ethel, Sandra’s mother, intensely dislikes Mott, he endears himself to her father, Spencer, by accidentally shooting Gurrey with birdshot at the Pattersons’ gun club. Mott reluctantly accepts a job in Spencer’s chain of department stores, and asks Sandra to marry him. Mott dislikes the work but carries on with help from alcohol and tranquilizers. Pappas, too, discourages Mott from marrying Sandra, fearing that Mott will gain influence over Gurrey. Mott is invited to dinner with Sandra, Ethel, and Gurrey, where the latter two attempt to convert him to Christianity, insisting that they will prevent his marriage to Sandra if he does not. Mott then facetiously attempts to convert them to Judaism, and, finally angered as Gurrey begins to say grace, begins to recite a Hebrew prayer, realizing that “I had arrived as an atheist, but they had made me a Jew.” When Ethel goes on a hunger strike to pressure Mott to convert, he goes to reason with her and ends up having sexual intercourse with her; she does not reveal this to Sandra. Visiting Spencer late one night, Mott inadvertently learns that he is a transvestite, which led to his and Ethel’s divorce. Overwhelmed, Mott returns to work, only to injure himself in a manner that suggests stigmata, causing him to go on a rampage and trash sections of the store. On his way out, Mott realizes that he’s torn off his clothing, and replaces it with that of the nearest mannequin, which happens to be a ladies’ cocktail dress. Arriving home in a cab, he is met by Sandra and Ethel, who, assuming he is also a crossdresser, leaves in horror and takes Sandra with her. The next day, Mott learns that Sandra is being made to accompany Ethel to the rally Gurrey is holding in Tulsa to promote his and Pappas’s Bible-drop stunt. Mott signs Paulie out of his care facility, apologizes to Spencer, and flies to Tulsa with Paulie to rescue Sandra. Upon arriving, Mott runs into Dolly and Ulla. He leaves Paulie with Dolly, and forgives Ulla, though he is forced to leave her in a terrified, near-catatonic state as the gathering is giving her flashbacks of Nazi rallies. Mott, armed with photos he stole from Pappas of Gurrey and Ulla having intercourse, storms into the revival tent, confronts Pappas, and tries to leave with Sandra. As they flee the tent, Gurrey proclaims Mott to be a demon and orders the crowd to stop him. When Dolly and Paulie show up, the crowd mistakes Paulie for Mott, and Mott, unable to stop their frenzied attack, is separated from Sandra but makes his escape in one of Pappas’s hot air balloons. ==References== Category:1966 American novels Category:American comedy novels Category:Picaresque novels Category:Fiction set in the 1960s ","title":"Mott the Hoople (novel)"},{"id":"35896442","text":"Destiny is an online-only multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie and previously published by Activision. Destiny is now self-published by Bungie after separating from Activision in 2019.https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47569 It was released worldwide on September 9, 2014, for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One consoles. Destiny marked Bungie's first new console franchise since the Halo series, and it was the first game in a ten-year agreement between Bungie and Activision. Set in a \\"mythic science fiction\\" world, the game features a multiplayer \\"shared-world\\" environment with elements of role-playing games. Activities in Destiny are divided among player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types. In addition to normal story missions, PvE features three-player \\"strikes\\" and six-player raids. A free roam patrol mode is also available for each planet and features public events. PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional deathmatch game modes. Players take on the role of a Guardian, protectors of Earth's last safe city as they wield a power called Light to protect the City from different alien races. Guardians are tasked with reviving a celestial being called the Traveler, while journeying to different planets to investigate and destroy the alien threats before humanity is completely wiped out. Bungie released four expansion packs, furthering the story, and adding new content, missions, and new PvP modes. Year One of Destiny featured two small expansions, The Dark Below in December 2014 and House of Wolves in May 2015. A third, larger expansion, The Taken King, was released in September 2015 and marked the beginning of Year Two, changing much of the core gameplay. The base game and the first three expansions were packaged into Destiny: The Taken King Legendary Edition. Another large expansion called Rise of Iron was released in September 2016, beginning Year Three. Rise of Iron was only released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One; PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 clients subsequently stopped receiving content updates. The base game and all four expansions were packaged into Destiny: The Collection. A direct sequel, Destiny 2, released in September 2017. Upon its release, Destiny received generally positive reviews with criticism centered mostly around the game's storyline and post-campaign content. The game was praised for its gameplay, graphics and for maintaining lineage from the Halo franchise, particularly in regards to its competitive experiences. It sold over US$325 million at retail in its first five days, making it the biggest new franchise launch of all time. It was GamesRadar's 2014 Game of the Year and it received the BAFTA Award for Best Game at the 2014 British Academy Video Games Awards. ==Gameplay== Destiny gameplay Destinys style has been described as a first-person shooter that incorporates role-playing and MMO elements, but Bungie has avoided describing Destiny as a traditional MMO game. Instead, the game has been referred to as a \\"shared- world shooter\\", as it lacks many of the characteristics of a traditional MMO game. For instance, rather than players being able to communicate with all other players in the game or on a particular server — as is the case in many conventional MMO games — Destiny includes on-the-fly matchmaking that allows players to communicate only with other players with whom they are \\"matched\\" by the game. To communicate with other players in the game world, players must use their respective console's messaging system. Time-limited events and modes are also occasionally added or featured in-game. Activities in Destiny are divided among player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types across the Cosmodrome and the Plaguelands (added with Rise of Iron) on Earth, its Moon, Venus, and Mars. There are also PvP maps for Mars's moon Phobos and the planet Mercury. A social space on Mercury was added with the House of Wolves expansion, but requires players to go undefeated in the Trials of Osiris Crucible mode in order to access it. Another PvE area, a massive ship called the Dreadnaught that is situated in the rings of Saturn, and two PvE missions on Phobos were added with The Taken King expansion. ===Character progression and classes=== Players are able to improve their characters, referred to as Guardians, by gaining experience points (EXP) — when a set number of experience points are accumulated, the player's character will \\"level up\\" and gain improved statistics which further enhance performance in battle. Quests, including the \\"main scenario\\" quest line, are specific tasks given to the player by non-player characters which reward items and EXP. Completing main scenario quests progresses the overarching plot of the game. Destiny features three character classes. Each class has their own specific upgrades, perks, special abilities, and three sub-classes that allow the player to finely tune their individual characters to provide a different play style. After choosing a class, players select one of three species for their character: Human, Awoken (bluish-gray-skinned descendants of Humans), or Exo (human consciousness in a machine). They can then customize their character, such as changing its gender or skin color. A character's species is only cosmetic and does not affect gameplay. Players can create two more characters to have a character of each class. The Taken King added a third sub-class for each class, but requires the purchase of the DLC to access the new sub- classes. * Hunters are designed to be like a bounty hunter with a focus on agility and mobility. Its Solar-based \\"Gunslinger\\" sub-class tree includes stat boosts that award accurate play, a throwing knife attack, the ability to upgrade to a triple jump, and the \\"Golden Gun\\" super, a very powerful, flaming magnum with a base magazine of three shots. The Arc-based \\"Bladedancer\\" sub- class has a heavier focus on close combat, offering an extended-range \\"Blink Strike\\", and an \\"Arc Blade\\" super (which allows the player to quickly dart between and kill enemies) with a temporary invisibility option. The Taken King added the Void-based \\"Nightstalker\\" sub-class that includes a bow-like super called \\"Shadowshot\\" that tethers enemies together, limiting movement and preventing enemies from using abilities for a short time. It can also be used to do stealth attacks or blind enemies for a brief time. * Warlocks are designed as a mage, or a space wizard, with a larger focus on offensive abilities, recovery, and melee attacks that can reduce the cooldown time of its abilities. Its super in the \\"Voidwalker\\" sub-class, \\"Nova Bomb\\", is an explosively powerful sphere of Void energy capable of being thrown in different ways. Its \\"Sunsinger\\" sub-class features abilities based around the Solar element, with the \\"Radiance\\" super allowing the player to temporarily improve their statistics, or revive themselves if killed. The Taken King added the Arc-based \\"Stormcaller\\" sub-class that includes the super \\"Stormtrance\\", which produces lightning bolts that chains between enemies. * Titans are designed to be \\"tanks\\", with a focus on withstanding large amounts of damage to allow close quarters combat. The Titan's super in the Arc-based \\"Striker\\" sub-class, \\"Fist of Havoc\\", is a ground slamming attack that destroys all enemies in its radius. Its Void-based \\"Defender\\" sub-class offers the ability to generate a shield with its \\"Ward of Dawn\\" super. The shield can also provide temporary stat bonuses to other players that step within it. The Taken King added the \\"Sunbreaker\\" sub-class, which features a Solar-based super, the \\"Hammer of Sol\\", creating a flaming hammer that can be thrown at enemies, or used for close-quarters combat. Upon reaching the character level cap, character progression shifts to improving their \\"Light\\" level by acquiring new and better equipment. This equipment can be gained through a variety of sources, including \\"strikes\\", raids, and in-game events. Prior to The Taken King, all legendary and exotic armor, and some rare, contained an attribute called Light. Once players reached level 20, they no longer earned experience to level up; EXP earned after level 20 went towards upgrading weapons and armor, and creating Motes of Light, an in-game currency. Players could only go beyond level 20 by obtaining armor with Light, and these levels were referred to as Light levels. The initial Light level cap was 30, which increased to 32 with The Dark Below and 34 with the House of Wolves. Update patch 2.0, released in preparation for The Taken King, made the character's experience level and Light level separate: level 34 is now the experience level cap for all players; level 40 for players who own The Taken King and Rise of Iron. A higher character level allows for better equipment to be equipped. A character's Light level is now an average of the attack and defense of all equipped gear. For example, if all equipped gear has 170 Light each, the character's Light level will be 170. A higher Light level improves damage output and defense. The highest obtainable Light level was 320 for players who owned The Taken King; the expansion's April Update increased it to 335. Rise of Iron increased the highest obtainable Light level to 400. Players' equipment includes weapons and armor. Legendary and exotic items are the best items for players' characters, and only one exotic weapon and one exotic armor (excluding exotic class items) can be equipped at one time. There are several different classes of weapons that are categorized as either a primary, special (secondary), or heavy weapon. Several weapons have an elemental damage type. There is Arc (blue), Solar (orange), and Void (purple). All damage types will deplete enemy shields of that type faster, and the weapon will also do extra damage to enemies if the gameplay modifiers 'Arc Burn', 'Solar Burn' or 'Void Burn' are active. The original maximum attack damage for legendary and exotic weapons was 300. This increased to 331 with The Dark Below and 365 with the House of Wolves. Because of the change to the Light level system, The Taken King numerically changed weapons of 365 damage to 170, but with no loss in damage output (365 damage of Year 1 equals 170 damage of Year 2). As with armor, weapons' attack damage contributes to the Light level and all gear can be infused to increase their numbers. There are six armor slots: helmet, gauntlets, chest, legs, class item, and artifact (artifacts were added with The Taken King). Each class has armor specific to them with exotic armor that complement a character's sub-class. Each piece of armor increases overall defense. Before The Taken King, class items were only cosmetic (such as the Hunter's cloak) and did not have any stat or defense boosts. With The Taken King update, class items were given defense that contributes to players' Light level. Players' Ghost companion was also given defense with The Taken King update that contributes to their Light level. In addition to earning gear from loot drops by playing missions and other activities, players can purchase gear from faction vendors. Players can pledge their allegiance to one of three factions — Dead Orbit, Future War Cult, or New Monarchy — and earning enough reputation with a faction allows players to earn and purchase that faction's legendary items. Players also earn reputation with other vendors, such as the Vanguard and Crucible, by doing playlists or bounties for that vendor, which also have their own set of legendary items. ===Player versus environment (PvE)=== Player versus environment game types makes up the majority of the game. PvE story missions can be played either solo or as part of a \\"fireteam\\" of up to three players. Initially, although there was an order to the story missions, they could be played in any order as more missions became available. For example, after completing Earth's second story mission, three more became available, but did not have to be played in story order. The questing system introduced in House of Wolves and refined in The Taken King requires story missions to be played in order due to quest step progression. Every day, a random story mission is featured as the Daily Heroic Story Mission, featuring bonus rewards. Each playable area offers an open world \\"Patrol\\" mode, where players can travel freely around the area and perform small tasks gathered from beacons, and they can collect materials that are used for upgrading weapons and armor. Players travel around the areas on foot or with their vehicles called Sparrows (very similar to the speeder bikes of Star Wars). Public events happen periodically and any player in the same location can participate. These location-specific events include eliminating a target, defeating incoming waves of enemies, and defending a Warsat (a crashed satellite). \\"Strikes\\" are cooperative missions played with a party of three players that culminate with a boss; most strikes are side missions that are not part of the main plot. Players can play much harder versions of the strikes in what are called the SIVA Crisis Strike (formerly Vanguard Heroic Playlist) and the Weekly Nightfall Strike, which grant bonus rewards. While the SIVA Crisis is a playlist of strikes from The Taken King and Rise of Iron (as well as older strikes updated with Taken and SIVA-infected enemies), the Weekly Nightfall Strike, which is harder than heroic, is only one strike that changes every week with a chance for greater rewards. The Daily Heroic Story Mission, SIVA Crisis Strike, and Weekly Nightfall Strike each feature game modifiers that increase difficulty. Game modifiers can be positive or negative for the player. For example, a positive modifier would be \\"Small Arms\\", where damage for the player's primary weapons are doubled, but a negative modifier would be \\"Chaff\\", where the player's radar is disabled. Raids are advanced cooperative missions designed to be played by a team of six players — the only PvE game type that allows more than three players in a fireteam. Raids culminate with the elimination of a major boss that relates to the story. With the release of Rise of Iron, there are four raids in Destiny. From social spaces (the Tower on Earth, the Vestian Outpost added with House of Wolves, and the Iron Temple added with Rise of Iron), players can redeem \\"engrams\\" into items, buy items, and collect challenges known as bounties to complete during activities to earn experience, build their reputation among factions, and sometimes earn items. Beyond armor and weapons, items that players can obtain include ships that represent themselves during travel cutscenes, shaders for customizing the color scheme of their armor, emblems which are banners for players' names, emotes such as a dance or gesture, and shells for their Ghost companion. ===Player versus player (PvP)=== In addition to these player versus environment challenges, player versus player combat exists in what is called the Crucible. The Crucible, which can have a maximum of twelve players depending on game type, contains playlists of PvP modes, including \\"Control\\", \\"Clash\\", \\"Rumble\\", and \\"Skirmish\\". Control is six-versus-six where teams try to capture and maintain control of zones. Clash is a classic six- versus-six team deathmatch. Rumble is a six-player free-for-all deathmatch. Skirmish is a three-versus-three deathmatch where players can revive allies. New modes have been added via expansions, including \\"Elimination\\" (House of Wolves), a similar mode to Skirmish except divided into nine rounds in which the team must kill all three of their opponents at once, \\"Rift\\" (The Taken King), a six-versus-six capture the flag-like mode where players must deliver a \\"Spark\\" to the opposing team's base, killing enemies in its radius, and \\"Supremacy\\" (Rise of Iron), a six-versus-six mode where players drop crests when killed and points are scored by picking up crests dropped by the enemy team. Other modes are available occasionally during time-limited periods, such as \\"Salvage\\", a three-versus-three king of the hill game type, \\"Combined Arms\\", where the Control and Clash modes are on maps with vehicles and turrets, \\"Inferno\\" (The Dark Below), a modifier on multiple game modes where points are solely scored on kills and the player's radar is disabled, \\"Doubles\\" (The Dark Below), a two-versus-two version of Skirmish, \\"Mayhem\\" (The Taken King), a modifier on Clash and Rumble where cooldown times for all abilities are greatly reduced, and \\"Zone Control\\" (The Taken King), a modified version of Control where points are only scored for maintaining control of zones, and not by kills or point captures. A random mode is featured as the Daily and Weekly Crucible mode with bonus rewards. As of September 2015, players who do not own The Taken King or Rise of Iron expansions only have access to three-versus-three and six-versus-six Crucible playlists on previous maps with assorted modes, and no longer have access to playlists for individual modes. In Crucible modes, player statistics (such as weapon power and defense) are balanced between players. The periodic events Iron Banner and Trials of Osiris are offered, which disable balancing. These events have their own set of bounties and allows players the chance to earn exclusive items. Iron Banner became available shortly after the launch of Destiny and originally only used the Control game mode; with the release of Rise of Iron, it rotates between Control, Clash, Rift, and Supremacy. It is available during the last week of each month. Trials of Osiris was added with the House of Wolves expansion and uses the Elimination mode. It is available every weekend from Friday until the weekly reset on Tuesday. Players who go undefeated in this mode gain access to an exclusive social space on Mercury called The Lighthouse. A week prior to the launch of the Rise of Iron expansion, the option to make private matches was added; this option is available to all players on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, regardless if they purchase Rise of Iron. Private matches allow players to set up their own custom matches. Customization options include game mode, map, score and time limits, enabling Light level, and time of day. Players can choose the number of players for the match, including beginning a match by themselves. ==SynopsisSetting=== Bungie described the setting of Destiny as a \\"mythic science-fiction\\" world. The setting, about 700 years in the future, follows a prosperous period of exploration, peace, and technological advancement known as the Golden Age. In a universe where humans have spread out and colonized planets in the Solar System, an event known as \\"the Collapse\\" saw the mysterious dissolution of these colonies, the end of the Golden Age, and mankind teetering on the brink of extinction. The only known survivors of the Collapse are those living on Earth, who were saved by \\"the Traveler\\", a white, spherical celestial body whose appearance centuries before had enabled humans to reach the stars. The Collapse was caused by a mysterious force called the Darkness, an ancient enemy of the Traveler that plagues the galaxy. The Traveler now hovers above the last safe city on Earth, simply called The Last City, which is surrounded by a massive Wall, and its presence allows the Guardians — the defenders of the City — the ability to wield an unknown power, only referred to as \\"Light\\". The player takes on the role of a Guardian, and is tasked with reviving the Traveler while investigating and destroying alien threats before humanity is completely wiped out. Upon mankind's first attempt to repopulate and reconstruct after the Collapse, it is discovered that hostile alien races have occupied mankind's former colonies and civilizations, and are now encroaching upon the City. Throughout the game, players have to combat aggressive aliens who have occupied the Solar System. Just like the Light for the Guardians, the Darkness lends powers to these alien threats. There are five separate races in the game, each occupying different planets. The Fallen are an insectoid race of nomadic pirates who scavenge ruined settlements on Earth, the Moon, and Venus for resources. The Hive are a macabre race of ancient aliens who have created massive underground settlements beneath Earth and the Moon's surface. The Vex are semi-organic androids who are attempting to seize control of Venus and Mars by turning them into their machines, which they have already done to Mercury. The Cabal are a military-industrial empire of gigantic amphibians who have established massive fortifications on Mars. The Taken, a new race introduced in The Taken King, are corrupted versions of regular enemies, who infest areas on every planet. Rise of Iron added a new faction of Fallen called the Devil Splicers, which are Fallen who have been modified by a technological plague called SIVA. They are found on Earth in a zone outside of the Wall called the Plaguelands. Every race utilizes different tactics and weapons in combat. The Fallen possess cloaking and short-range teleportation technologies to increase their mobility. The Hive use superior numbers to overwhelm their opponents in close quarters while more elite units attack from a distance. The Vex utilize hard-light shields and teleport units of infantry into the battlefield en-masse. The Cabal rely on heavy armor, ballistic shields, and jump packs to combat players. The Taken, in addition to all the other races specialties, use high mobility and plenty of long-range attacks to out-maneuver the player. The Devil Splicers use multiple, unpredictable, lightning-like shots to surprise the player and hit them even while strafing. All of these races are hostile towards each other (with the exception of the Hive and the Taken), as they can often be observed attacking one another in- game for territorial dominance. The majority of the game's lore, detailing backstory on characters, weapons, the alien races, planets, etc., is found in Grimoire cards collected throughout the game and accessed through Bungie's website and the Destiny app. ===Characters=== softball. In addition to the player's Guardian, Destiny has many non-playable characters (NPCs) that aide the Guardians either in story missions, or by selling gear, weapons, or materials. The main NPCs in Destiny are Ghost (originally Peter Dinklage, replaced by Nolan North), a robot artificial intelligence that accompanies the Guardians; The Speaker (Bill Nighy), the representative of The Traveler; the Exo Stranger (Lauren Cohan), a mysterious female Exo who is interested in the Guardian's activities, but is not a Guardian herself; Mara Sov (Kirsten Potter), the Queen of the Reef and the Awoken, and the Kell (leader) of the Fallen House of Wolves; Prince Uldren Sov (Brandon O'Neill), the Queen's brother; Ikora Rey (Gina Torres), the Warlock Vanguard; Commander Zavala (Lance Reddick), the Titan Vanguard; Cayde-6 (Nathan Fillion), the Hunter Vanguard; and Master Rahool (Erick Avari), the Tower's Cryptarch who decodes engrams and buys curiosities from Guardians. The player's Guardian is voiced by one of six people, depending on which species and gender the player selects when creating their character: Matthew Mercer and Susan Eisenberg as the male and female Human guardians, Crispin Freeman and Grey Griffin as the male and female Awoken Guardians, and Peter Jessop and Cree Summer as the male and female Exo Guardians. Other notable NPCs include Lord Shaxx (Lennie James), the Crucible Handler; Lakshmi-2 (Shohreh Aghdashloo), representative of Future War Cult; Arach Jalaal (Peter Stormare), representative of Dead Orbit; Executor Hideo (James Remar), representative of New Monarchy; Tess Everis (Claudia Black), Eververse Trading Company (microtransaction vendor that primarily sells emotes); Banshee-44 (John DiMaggio), the Gunsmith; Amanda Holliday (Courtenay Taylor), ship and sparrow merchant; Lord Saladin (Keith Ferguson), former Iron Banner vendor who became the main NPC of Rise of Iron; Xûr (Fred Tatasciore), an Agent of the Nine and exotic items vendor; and Eva Levante (Nika Futterman), the Guardian Outfitter (vendor that sells emblems and armor shaders). Several characters were introduced in the expansions and events of Destiny. These include Petra Venj (April Stewart), the Queen's Emissary who was introduced with the Queen's Wrath event and returned as a main NPC in House of Wolves; Eris Morn (Morla Gorrondona), Crota's Bane vendor that was introduced as the main NPC of The Dark Below and is a main NPC of The Taken King; Variks the Loyal (Dee Bradley Baker), House of Judgment vendor who was introduced as a main NPC of the House of Wolves and is a Fallen Vandal loyal to the Queen; Master Ives (Gideon Emery), the Vestian Outpost's Cryptarch; Brother Vance (Bob O'Donnell), a Disciple of Osiris and the Trials of Osiris vendor — Osiris is a character in the lore of Destiny; Tyra Karn, an archivist in the Iron Temple added with Rise of Iron who is also a Cryptarch; Shiro-4, a scout and Vanguard vendor in the Iron Temple; and Lady Efrideet (Riva Di Paola), a former Iron Lord discovered to still be alive who has taken command of the Iron Banner in Saladin's place, as Saladin is now focused on the SIVA Crisis. ===Plot=== When the game begins, Ghost is searching among the detritus of Old Russia until it finds and resurrects the player's Guardian, who had been killed in an ancient battle. Ghost then guides the Guardian to a jump ship and they take it to the Tower. There, they meet the Speaker, who briefs them about the Darkness. The Guardian is then tasked to probe the nearby Cosmodrome, where humanity used to launch its forays into outer space, fending off Fallen enemies and eventually the Hive, who were thought to have been confined to the Moon. The Guardian discovers that an old Russian Warmind called Rasputin, an AI built to defend Earth, is still alive and acting with unknown intent. The Guardian also tracks down codes to raise an ancient Array to connect it to long-lost colonies throughout the Solar System, and finds that Rasputin is controlling the Array. They then set off to the Moon in search of a lost Guardian who was looking for a way into the Hive fortress. After locating his corpse and dead Ghost, the player's Guardian's Ghost discovers that the Hive are raising an army and plan to invade Earth. The Guardian quickly sets about disrupting their efforts, including shutting down a ritual that the Hive were using to drain power from the Traveler, destroying a powerful weapon called the Sword of Crota, and severing their long-distance communications. Around this time, the Guardian is contacted by the Exo Stranger, a mysterious woman who summons them to Venus to face a new enemy, the Vex. When the Guardian arrives on Venus, the Exo Stranger describes the Vex as an evil so dark it despises other evil. She tells them about the Black Garden, a city where the Vex are born, and implores the Guardian to find it and rip out its heart, as it is the only way the Traveler will begin to heal. Ghost says that they need to speak to the Awoken, who lurk out in the Reef (the asteroid belt) and refuse to take sides in the galaxy's wars. The Exo Stranger then leaves, as she did not have time to explain things further. Once the Guardian arrives at the Reef, they meet the Queen of the Reef, Mara Sov, and her brother, Prince Uldren Sov, who tells the Guardian that they will help them locate the Black Garden if they bring them the head of a Vex Gate Lord. The Guardian travels back to Venus, where they uncover the Archive, which reveals secrets about the Vex, including the location of a place called the Vault of Glass, and pathways across the galaxy. After defeating Draksis, a Fallen Kell of the House of Winter, the Guardian confronts the Vex Gate Lord, claims its head, and returns to the Queen, who tells them to take its eye to the Meridian Bay on Mars, where it can be used to enter the Black Garden. After arriving on Mars in the Meridian Bay, Ghost informs the Guardian of its inhabitants. The Cabal have been trying to break the encryption on the Vex Gate with only limited success, but they do control many of the places that the Guardian needs to visit on Mars thanks to their Exclusion Zone, which nobody had ever penetrated. The player's Guardian becomes the first to penetrate the Exclusion Zone and heads to the Garden's Spire, which charges the Gate Lord's eye. They also travel to the Buried City, the birthplace of many technological wonders where they discover an AI that used to be linked to the Warmind of Mars, but is now controlled by Rasputin. With the Vex now present on Mars, the Guardian finds out what they are doing; they are returning to their home, the Black Garden. The Guardian then sets off to the Black Garden. After going through a teleporter, they find themselves in a place that is not on any map of known space and time. After several battles, the Guardian reaches the heart of the Black Garden, which the Vex appear to be worshipping. The heart summons three Sol Progeny — a group of Vex units called Eschaton Mind, Imminent Mind, and Primeval Mind. After defeating the three Sol Progeny, the heart is destroyed, returning the Guardian to Mars and lifting the shroud of Darkness from the Traveler back on Earth. At the Tower, the Speaker addresses gathered Guardians in a celebratory speech. Over in the nearby hangar, though, the player's Guardian converses with the Exo Stranger, who says that the fight is far from over. With the heart of the Black Garden destroyed, a team of Guardians decide to investigate the mysterious Vault of Glass (\\"Vault of Glass\\" raid). Described as the \\"Vex underworld\\" by the Ishtar Collective, the Vault is a realm where the Vex can control reality—even erase people from existence (a power used by a Vex sub-race called Gorgons). While these powers do not extend to outside the Vault, its enigmatic nature has lured countless Guardians, including the ill-fated Kabr, the Legionless, and Praedyth. In their descent of the Vault, the team defeats The Templar and its Oracles. They then successfully traverse the Gorgon's labyrinth undetected before reaching Atheon, Time's Conflux, a central figure of the Vex Conflux network who has powerful control over time, being able to send Guardians into the distant past or future at will. After fighting their way through time, the Guardians defeat Atheon, eliminating a major threat of the Vex. ==Development== Development for Destiny began at Bungie in 2010 under the code name \\"Project Tiger\\", shortly after the release of Halo: Reach. This coincided with the announcement of a 10-year publishing agreement with Activision Blizzard. Under Bungie's agreement with Activision, new intellectual property developed by Bungie will be owned by Bungie, not Activision, in a deal similar to the EA Partners Program. Details of this contract were revealed during the course of Activision's lawsuit against Jason West and Vincent Zampella, founders and former employees of Infinity Ward, including provisions for four Destiny games over the course of the ten-year deal. Initially, Activision Blizzard CEO Robert Kotick suggested that the total investment in Destiny would be around $500 million. Bungie's COO Pete Parsons clarified that the game's development cost is not even close to $500 million, saying, \\"For marketing you'd have to ask Activision people, but for development costs, not anything close to $500 million.\\" Activision subsequently confirmed the $500 million figure, stating that marketing, up-front infrastructure costs, and investment in the game's engine were included, and could be amortized over the life of the IP. Bungie would earn an additional $2.5 million bonus payout if the first game achieved a Metacritic score of 90 or above. By mid-2013, most of the ground work for Destiny had been completed including lore, game engine, and many environments and missions, tracking for a September 2013 release. However, a \\"supercut\\" of the game's story and mission structure presented by Joseph Staten's writing team did not test well with Bungie upper management, led by Jason Jones. Jones felt that the story was too dense and linear— a design philosophy he felt was important to Destiny was the ability for the player to choose where to go at any time. As a result, the entire mission progression of the game was rebuilt between mid-2013 and the game's launch in September 2014, shifting away from a structure that quickly introduced the four major environments — Earth, the Moon, Venus, and Mars — to a hub-based structure in which each planet would be visited sequentially with an expanding variety of missions on each. Existing missions were spliced and rearranged to fit this new paradigm, including dialogue and cinematics. Staten decided to leave the company amidst this reboot, though this would not be announced until September 2013. To cement the new framework, Jones developed the director interface that exists in the shipping version of the game, from which planets and missions can be selected. He also established the \\"Iron Bar\\", a series of executive meetings which would oversee the massive project restructuring. This also involved rescoping the project to be more focused — areas such as the Hive fortress Dreadnaught, an Earth location called the European Dead Zone, and Osiris' temple on Mercury were cut — all would later return in future installments. The restructuring also required an internal delay of the release date first from September 2013 to March 2014, and again to its actual release of September 9, 2014. With Staten's departure, the writing team he had built at Bungie for the Halo series was left leaderless and isolated. As a result, much of this extra time was spent perfecting the gameplay and feel of the shooting while the narrative was only polished to a perfunctory level and \\"the story was written without writers\\". On April 11, 2014, Bungie fired its long- time composer and audio director, Martin O'Donnell. For Destiny, O'Donnell collaborated with Paul McCartney on an eight-movement symphonic suite called Music of the Spheres which was completed in 2013. The dispute which led to his termination originated from O'Donnell's belief that the Activision deal had begun to erode the collegial culture at Bungie. Activision was reluctant to release the symphony as a standalone work and went over O'Donnell's head to replace it with their own music in a prominent E3 2013 trailer. In the ensuing disagreement, O'Donnell came into conflict with both Activision and Bungie leadership and was accused of \\"unacceptable conduct\\" in his performance review, leading to his termination. Fans were concerned that the absence of Martin O'Donnell would affect the in-game music of Destiny; however, Pete Parsons of Bungie confirmed that Destinys music was already complete by this point. O'Donnell prevailed in a civil suit against Bungie over the improper dismissal in September 2015, winning unpaid wages, profit sharing, and lost stock. ===Technology=== Destiny incorporates a new game engine that allows global illumination and real-time dynamic lighting to occur together in cohesion. In addition, Bungie's goal is that Destiny will natively render graphics at 1080p on both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. An innovation in Bungie's \\"hopper\\" technology, which has been the backbone for Halos matchmaking system, will allow better player matchmaking in order to create a more natural experience in either cooperative or competitive multiplayer modes. Developers at Bungie have criticized the new engine as ill-suited to the online nature of the game. Its resource-intensive nature makes even small changes to maps require an overnight rendering and compiling process. Internal sources called the development of new maps and missions \\"grueling\\" on account of the game engine. ===Design=== For Destiny, lead writer Joseph Staten hoped to build a universe that would \\"take on a life of its own\\". The designers worked around \\"seven pillars\\", seven core principles which ensure that the game is accessible to both casual, novice players and experienced veterans of first-person shooters and MMOs. This includes integration with social media, allowing players to gain information about new quests and their friends' activities. In designing the playable classes, Bungie was inspired by different sources of science fiction. Hunters are a reconnaissance class meant to be reminiscent of the classic bounty hunter. Bungie cites as influences Star Wars Han Solo and classic characters from old Western films such as Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name. Warlocks combine weapons with special powers from \\"the Traveler\\", and are meant to be a form of \\"space wizard\\". The Warlock class is influenced by the Star Wars series's Jedi Knights, The Lord of the Rings series's Gandalf, and The Matrix series's Morpheus. Titans, which favor heavy weapons and melee attacks and are intended to be reminiscent of the classic \\"future soldier\\", were inspired by Bungie's own Master Chief from Halo, Stormtroopers from Star Wars, and other \\"space marines\\" from science fiction. Bungie also cited the influence of action role-playing games Monster Hunter and Dark Souls, noting their mechanical depth and brutality. Peter Dinklage originally voiced the character Ghost in the base game. The character did not have any lines in the two expansions of Year One. Nolan North replaced Dinklage for The Taken King and also re-recorded all of Ghost's lines from the original game, as Bungie wanted \\"to create a consistent storytelling experience from beginning to end\\". North was excited to put his mark on the role and hopes to evolve the character in future Destiny releases. He said that he did not listen to any of Dinklage's recordings, as he did not want any preconceived notions to influence his performance. According to Bungie, the actor change was made due to Dinklage's availability. David Cross was hired to write jokes for the character Ghost but none of his work was used in the final game. ===Soundtrack=== Destiny Original Soundtrack Destiny (Original Soundtrack) is the official soundtrack for the video game, composed by Michael Salvatori, C Paul Johnson, Martin O'Donnell and Paul McCartney. Released digitally via iTunes on September 26, 2014, the soundtrack contains 44 instrumental compositions from the game. The soundtrack marked O'Donnell's final work for Bungie, after years of composing for the Halo franchise, as well as several games before that. In addition, McCartney wrote and recorded an original song inspired by the game, titled \\"Hope for the Future\\". Early in Destinys development, O'Donnell was contacted by Pete Parsons (current Chief Operating Officer of Bungie), and was asked to begin writing music for the game. At the time, Destiny was still in its infancy, as it lacked any gameplay material for O'Donnell to score music to, so instead, O'Donnell began creating music based solely on the games ideas, stories, and artwork. By February 17, 2013, over 50 minutes of the soundtrack had already been recorded with a 106-piece orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London. O'Donnell gave the early pieces of music to Bungie in hopes that they would foster inspiration within the development team. Unlike the Halo series, where pieces of music were only 2–3 minutes long, Martin has stated that the soundtrack for Destiny has no time restrictions, with the pieces clocking in \\"as long as they need to be\\". O'Donnell collaborated with Paul McCartney on the soundtrack for the better part of two years, as they traded ideas, melody samples, and themes back and forth. On April 11, 2014, Martin O'Donnell was dismissed without cause by the board of directors at Bungie. This caused concern as to whether this would affect the game; however, Pete Parsons stated that O'Donnell's work on the game had been completed before his dismissal and would appear in the final product. Music of the Spheres Music of the Spheres is an eight-part musical companion piece to Destiny, composed by Marty O’Donnell together with Michael Salvatori and Paul McCartney. Parts of the music were used to accompany a Destiny trailer at E3 2013, and in the official soundtrack. But following O'Donnell's dismissal from and subsequent legal dispute with Bungie, Music of the Spheres remained unreleased. It was leaked to the Internet by unknown persons in December 2017. Bungie officially released the album on June 1, 2018. ===Release=== Destiny concept art and plot elements first leaked in November 2012. Bungie supplemented the leak with more details, expressing regret that another upcoming video game had been revealed ahead of schedule. Destinys official unveiling occurred at the PlayStation 4 announcement event on February 20, 2013. An alpha test took place from June 12 to 16, 2014 exclusively on PS4. A public beta test began on PlayStation consoles on July 17, 2014 and Xbox consoles on July 23, 2014, available to players who pre- ordered the game. Before the beta closed on July 27, it attracted around 4.6 million players. The game went gold on August 23, 2014. Destiny was released worldwide on September 9, 2014 for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One. Players who pre-ordered the game received early access to the Vanguard Armory. Additionally, pre-orders from GameStop received an exclusive \\"red\\" sparrow vehicle. Players who pre-ordered Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare received a Blacksmith armor shader in Destiny. Those who purchased the digital PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 versions of the game were allowed to download the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One clients respectively at no additional cost, until January 15, 2015. Some of the game's initial content, including certain items and missions, were timed exclusives for PlayStation platforms. These included the \\"Dust Palace\\" strike, the \\"Exodus Blue\\" Crucible map, two exotic weapons (the auto rifle \\"Monte Carlo\\" and hand cannon \\"Hawkmoon\\"), a rare gear set for each class (Manifold Seeker for Warlock, Vanir for Titan, and Argus for Hunter), and three ships (\\"Aurora Awake\\", \\"Crypt Hammer\\", and \\"Outrageous Fortune\\"). Each expansion followed suit and had timed exclusives for PlayStation platforms. The initial exclusive content and the content of the first two expansions became available for the Xbox platforms with the release of The Taken King. The Taken Kings and Rise of Irons exclusive content became available in October 2017. Three collector's editions of Destiny were released: the Limited Edition, the Ghost Edition, and the Digital Limited Edition. The Limited Edition included a Steelbook game case, the Arms & Armament Field Guide, postcards from the Golden Age, Antique Star Chart, and in-game content: an exclusive Ghost shell, ship, character emblem, and the Destiny Expansion Pass. The Ghost Edition included everything in the Limited Edition, as well as a motion-activated replica Ghost with lights and the voice of Peter Dinklage and a set of photos and stickers. The Digital Limited Edition included Destiny and the in-game content included in the physical collector's editions. A PS4 bundle was also available, which included a 500GB glacier white PS4 and a copy of Destiny. With the release of The Taken King, two new retail versions of Destiny, the \\"Legendary Edition\\" and \\"Collector's Edition\\", were released alongside The Taken King: both included a copy of the game, all \\"Year One\\" DLC, and The Taken King. A Digital Collector's Edition was also available. Year One players received commemorative items when purchasing The Taken King. A new PS4 bundle was also available, which included a limited edition white 500GB PS4 with Destiny artwork on the face of the console, the Legendary Edition of The Taken King, and all bonus content from the Legendary and Digital Collector's Editions. Players who purchased The Taken King received an item called Spark of Light, which boosted one new character to level 25, the minimum level needed to play The Taken Kings content. With the release of Rise of Iron, a new retail version of Destiny was also released alongside the expansion called \\"Destiny: The Collection\\". It includes a copy of the game, and all DLC up to and including Rise of Iron. Like The Taken King, players who purchase Rise of Iron receive an item called Spark of Light, although this one boosts one new character to level 40, which is the minimum level needed to play Rise of Irons content. ==Post-release content== Prior to the official release of Destiny in September 2014, Bungie declared that a major component of the game would be a continuous release of new content. Bungie Director of Production Jonty Barnes said: \\"We're going to continuously update the game from now until the end of time. That's always going to be part of the philosophy of Destiny. We always wanted to build a new universe but keep building upon it, rather than to do a complete and utter restart periodically.\\" By the time of Destinys launch, two planned packs of downloadable content (DLC) had been officially announced: The Dark Below and House of Wolves. From the launch of Destiny, players could purchase the Destiny Expansion Pass, which included the first two expansions at a discounted price versus buying them separately. Players also received an exclusive sparrow (EV-30 Tumbler) if they purchased the Expansion Pass or The Dark Below by January 15, 2015. At E3 2015, Bungie officially announced a new expansion called The Taken King. A new, large expansion was confirmed in February 2016; its title, Rise of Iron, was revealed in June 2016. Bungie released the game's first raid, the \\"Vault of Glass\\", as part of the September 16, 2014, update and at the time, it was described as \\"Destinys most difficult mission\\". The Vault of Glass centers on the Vex race on Venus and requires players to defeat Atheon, Time's Conflux. In the weeks proceeding from the release of Destiny, players were reporting areas that could be accessed by various glitches or secret accesses. These areas have been described as appearing \\"half-baked\\", and were noted to often be devoid of items or NPCs. In an interview with Eurogamer, on the claims that these were on-disc DLC, Bungie president Harold Ryan replied that the content were incomplete resources intended to reduce download requirements for future DLC. The October 13, 2015, update brought the new vending shop \\"Eververse Trading Company\\", featuring NPC Tess Everis who now sells emotes in exchange for a new in-game currency, Silver — some complimentary Silver was given to all players when logging in after the update. Players can obtain more Silver via microtransactions. One of the first emotes was the Enthusiastic Dance, inspired by the Carlton Dance from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Bungie stressed that these emotes are completely optional and the microtransactions are an effort to \\"bolster the service provided by our live team for another full year\\". On December 15, 2015, boosting packs became available as microtransactions. The pack automatically boosts one character to level 25, and also features a temporary stat boost and \\"Telemetry\\" items to assist in further leveling. For Year Two following the release of The Taken King, senior designer Derek Carroll explained that the studio wanted to shift towards an \\"event-based model\\" with \\"surprises\\" for players, available to all owners of The Taken King at no additional charge, as opposed to a timed roadmap, as had previously been speculated. Marketing director Eric Osborne further clarified its plans for \\"Year Two\\", stating that it would not consist solely of time-limited events as had been implied by others, but new \\"events, activities, content, and features\\", as well as an event planned for early 2016 that will be \\"far larger than anything you’ve seen since the release of The Taken King\\". Prior to Rise of Irons launch and due to the expansion only being released for current consoles (PS4 and One), players' accounts on legacy consoles (PS3 and 360) were split from current consoles. Accounts were previously shared across consoles of the same family. Legacy consoles received their last update on July 26, 2016, excluding emergency fixes for future game-breaking issues. ===Expansions=== The Dark Below was released on December 9, 2014. The expansion added new content centering on the Hive race and their deity Crota, Son of Oryx. In addition to a new raid, \\"Crota's End\\", maximum attack damage was increased to 331 and the Light level increased to 32. House of Wolves was released on May 19, 2015; the expansion added new content centering on the Fallen race as players attempt to thwart a campaign by Skolas, Kell of Kells, to unite the Fallen race under his rule. Maximum attack damage was increased to 365 and the Light level increased to 34. A new social space was added (Vestian Outpost), as well as two multiplayer modes: the Prison of Elders (a PvE arena) and Trials of Osiris (PvP game type). The Taken King was released on September 15, 2015, marking the end of \\"Year One\\" of Destiny. The expansion focuses on Oryx, The Taken King and father of Crota, as he leads a new race of enemy, the Taken, to avenge his son's death. A new raid, \\"King's Fall\\", was added, new sub-classes were added, as well as many changes to the core gameplay of Destiny, including maximum Light level of 320. The Taken Kings April 12, 2016 update, referred to as the \\"April Update\\", increased the maximum Light level to 335. The update also added new challenges and increased difficulty for the Prison of Elders PvE arena, among other activities. A new quest storyline was also added where players must defeat Malok, a Taken prince attempting a rise to power in the aftermath of Oryx's defeat. Rise of Iron was released on September 20, 2016, for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One only, and marked the end of \\"Year Two\\". It focuses on the Fallen race as they have breached the Wall that surrounds the Cosmodrome and have acquired the SIVA virus, a Golden Age nanotechnology characterized by self-replication and self- assembly. Lord Saladin guides players as they set out to become the new generation of the Iron Lords and wipe out SIVA. New additions include a new PvP game mode, a significant light level increase (385 at launch, 400 with hard raid), a new Patrol zone on Earth (The Plaguelands), a new social space (Iron Temple), and a new raid, \\"Wrath of the Machine\\". The final update to Destiny released on March 28, 2017. Titled \\"Age of Triumph\\", it added a new 13-page record book, tracking players' progress since the original release of Destiny, and all raids prior to Rise of Iron were increased to Light level 390 with updated rewards that can drop at 400 Light. ===Events=== Shortly after the launch of Destiny, a two-week long event began on September 23, 2014, called \\"Queen's Wrath\\" with Petra Venj as its main NPC. This event featured bounties and multiple challenges on existing missions for players to complete to obtain exclusive items. A two-week long Halloween-themed event began on October 26, 2015 called \\"Festival of the Lost\\" where players could complete quest lines to earn decorative masks for their Guardians. Eva Levante was the main NPC for this event. It returned the following year on October 25, 2016, featuring new quests, masks, and rewards from new NPC Tyra Karn in the Iron Temple, as well as returning ones from the previous year from Eva Levante. On December 8, 2015, a new three-week long event became available called the \\"Sparrow Racing League\\" (SRL) with Amanda Holliday as its main NPC. In this event, players raced against each other on their sparrows, which Bungie described as a \\"six-player, free-for-all death race through enemy territory\\". It was only available to players who owned The Taken King. Sparrow Racing League returned as part of a new holiday event called \\"The Dawning\\" on December 13, 2016. The event introduced a new scoring system for Strikes, new quests, weapons, gear, gifts, and treasures, and SRL itself featured new tracks and new rewards. A Valentine's Day-themed event called \\"Crimson Days\\" commenced on February 9, 2016 and lasted for one week. Lord Shaxx was the main NPC of the event, and featured a new Crucible mode called Crimson Doubles, a two-versus-two Elimination-style game with a special buff. ===Gameplay changes=== Alongside the new story content of The Taken King, other major changes were made to the core gameplay of Destiny as part of the version 2.0 patch released on September 8, 2015, which coincided with a week-long free preview of the PvP multiplayer modes and maps of The Taken King; some of these changes apply to all users, regardless of whether they purchase The Taken King. The voice of the player's Ghost, Peter Dinklage, was replaced by Nolan North; all of Dinklage's existing Ghost dialogue was retroactively replaced with new versions recorded by North. Experience points are used to level past 20, as opposed to the previous \\"Light level\\" system. Characters' previously existing Light levels were converted to character levels when transitioning to the 2.0 patch, while a new separate Light level was determined by averaging the strength and power of the character's equipped gear. Class items, newly introduced Ghost shells for all players, and a new equippable item, a relic, provide additional boosts to a player's abilities. The process of earning faction reputation changed; players \\"pledge\\" to a faction for a week, during which they earn reputation for the chosen faction in addition to standard reputation. The Gunsmith NPC now offers reputation for the completion of weapon field testing bounties, which allow the ability to purchase a weekly Legendary weapon from his \\"Foundry Orders\\". A mercy rule and matchmaking improvements were added to the Crucible. Players' vaults can now hold up to 108 armor pieces, 108 weapons, and 72 miscellaneous items. A new \\"Progress\\" tab was added to the user menu, which displays character progression through the game's quest storylines, as well as currently active bounties and faction reputation. Up to four active bounties and quests can be pinned to be displayed on the bottom-right of the screen when Nav Mode is used. Players can turn in quests and bounties at any time, and up to 32 quests and 16 bounties can be stored in their inventory. All existing storylines were adapted to work under this new system. A new interface known as \\"Collections\\" allows players to track their exotic items, emblems, armor shaders, sparrows, ships, and emotes that they have found, as well as clues for how to obtain those they do not possess. The new \\"Legendary Mark\\" currency replaces Vanguard and Crucible marks (which were completely removed), and are shared across all of a user's characters. Legendary Marks can be used to re-purchase exotic items that had already been found by a user, along with upgraded versions of some pre- existing exotics through the new \\"Exotic Blueprints\\" system (although this also requires Exotic Shards), and engrams that are guaranteed to contain a legendary weapon. Gear can be \\"infused\\" with more powerful items to increase their strength, provided they are \\"of the same Year and gear slot, a similar quality and a higher level than the current gear\\". This allows players the choice of what weapons and gear they want to make the strongest. Newer weapons and some Year One exotics are capable of higher damage than existing Year One weapons; damage values on all existing weapons were scaled down numerically from 365 to 170 (though damage output is the same), with higher values representing weapons that are more powerful than those from Year One. ==ReceptionCritical reception=== Destiny received a generally positive critical reception upon release. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the Xbox One version 75/100 based on 11 reviews, and the PlayStation 4 version 76/100 based on 95 reviews. Bungie halted pre-release reviews stating that they felt the game should be graded only when its social aspects were operative and populated with \\"thousands of gamers\\" in order to give a proper assessment. GameSpot described the game as \\"a multiplayer shooter that cobbles together elements of massively multiplayer games but overlooks the lessons developers of such games learned many years ago\\"; however, the game's competitive multiplayer modes were praised for carrying on Bungie's expertise from the Halo franchise with well-designed maps. Tom Watson admitted in New Statesman that it \\"has taken over my life\\". He praised how the game \\"plundered the best bits of other successful franchises\\" such as Halo, Call of Duty, Wolfenstein: The New Order, and World of Warcraft. Danny O'Dwyer stated that Destinys development surfaces some troubling ethical questions about the role of design in video game addiction, comparing it to slot machines and lab- pigeons in variable reward experiments. \\"I'm not saying it's a bad game... I'm saying it's a manipulative one. I mean it's 'Farmville' for shooter fans; instead of farming for land, you're farming for XP, loot, and whatever fake new currency the game creates to keep you inside another masterfully crafted ratio-scheduling system.\\" The Verge criticized the game's reliance on collaboration with other players that demands at least a few hours each week in order to keep up with character power levels with a player's friends or being forced to play with strangers to complete the story content.I never expected Destiny to make me feel so very, very alone September 16, 2015 GameTrailers gave a generally positive review, but also criticized the weak story and uninspired game locations. However, they did praise the graphics as well as the rush the combat can provide the player. A general lack of cohesive communication between players was also criticized, with Game Informer calling it \\"downplayed and difficult\\". Eurogamer felt that the game's environments were \\"meticulously built, with plenty of enticing nooks and thoughtfully placed cover to support that thrilling combat\\", but that Patrol mode exposed the worlds as being more like \\"giant shooter levels connected by narrow passageways than a truly expansive open world\\". Destiny was criticized for its lack of story content, with many pointing to the disjointed narrative and shallow plot implementation. Bungie has since acknowledged that the story was lacking in some respects, and stated that the game's first DLC expansion, The Dark Below, would focus on providing more background to the universe of Destiny. The game's end-game content was the subject of criticism, due to its particular focus on grinding for rare items through various means (including multiplayer games and other missions). The discovery of \\"loot caves\\" — locations with quickly re-spawning enemies that could previously be used to farm for items — along with initial issues surrounding the Vault of Glass raid mission became associated with these lingering issues. Despite the criticism, the game received the title of Game of the Year from GamesRadar, the BAFTA Award for Best Game at the British Academy Video Games Awards. At the 2014 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR), the game won Original Dramatic Score, New IP and Control Precision, and was nominated for Game Design(New IP), Control Design (3D), Character Design and Art Direction (Contemporary). ===Sales=== On September 10, 2014, Activision claimed that Destiny was the most successful new gaming franchise launch, as the game shipped more than US$500 million to retail stores and first-parties worldwide. As of September 17, 2014, there have been over 11 million gameplay sessions within North America. It was also the biggest software launch for the PlayStation 4 since holiday 2013. On November 4, 2014, Activision Publishing CEO Eric Hirshberg revealed that the game has 9.5 million registered players. On December 23, 2014, Bungie revealed that 13 million people have played the game since its launch. As of January 5, 2015, the game has 16 million registered players. As of September 17, 2015, the game has 20 million players. Destiny sold 91,277 physical retail copies for PlayStation 4 and 49,503 retail copies for PlayStation 3 within the first week of release in Japan, placing second and third place respectively within the Japanese software sales charts for that particular week. Destiny was the third best-selling retail game in the United States in 2014. On May 6, 2015, Activision Blizzard announced that Destiny, along with another title from its subsidiary Blizzard Entertainment, Hearthstone have generated nearly US$1 billion for the company. 57% of Taken Kings UK sales were on PlayStation 4. As of November 2015, Destiny had 25 million registered users, a five million increase in three months. ==Sequel== In November 2014, Activision Publishing CEO Eric Hirshberg said \\"Work has also begun on future expansion packs as well as on our next full game release\\". Based on documents of the original release schedule for Destiny, Bungie and Activision intended to release new, disc-based sequels every other year until 2019, with large downloadable expansions in between. Originally planned for a September 2016 release (based on the original documents), Bungie confirmed on February 11, 2016 that a full sequel would be released in 2017. That same month, video game writer Christopher Schlerf, who was the lead writer for Halo 4 and worked on Mass Effect: Andromeda, joined Bungie. In December 2016, Bungie announced that Vicarious Visions would be joining the development team along with Activision. Bungie had confirmed that players' characters and progression would carry over into future releases. However, this was only true for the expansions of the original Destiny. For the sequel, players who reached level 20 and completed the Black Garden quest in the original had their characters' physical appearance carry over, but not their progression (e.g., powers and gear). Bungie did award veteran players in the sequel to acknowledge their accomplishments in the original Destiny. Bungie stated that the original Destiny would remain online even after the release of the sequel; players' characters will remain intact with their progression and items, and the game will be supported with patch updates. Destiny 2 was officially confirmed on March 27, 2017. This was followed up with a teaser trailer narrated by Cayde-6. The teaser showed the Tower under attack by the Cabal. A full reveal trailer released on March 30, showing the three class Vanguards, Commander Zavala, Cayde-6, and Ikora Rey, rallying Guardians in the war-torn Tower. The Cabal are being led by Ghaul, commander of the brutal Red Legion. It was also officially confirmed that in addition to releasing on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in September 2017, Destiny 2 would release on Microsoft Windows in October 2017, and exclusively via the Battle.net app, rather than Steam. In October 2019, the game was removed from Battle.net and was published via Steam. ==References== ;Note ;Footnote ==External links== * * Destiny at Bungie Category:2014 video games Category:Action role-playing video games Category:Activision games Category:Bungie games Category:First-person shooters Category:Interactive Achievement Award winners Category:Mercury (planet) in fiction Category:Multiplayer video games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Phobos (moon) in fiction Category:Post- apocalyptic video games Category:Rings of Saturn in fiction Category:Role- playing video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Video games about extraterrestrial life Category:Venus in fiction Category:Video games about amnesia Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in Europe Category:Video games set on Mars Category:Video games set on the Moon Category:Video games with downloadable content Category:Video games with expansion packs Category:Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox One games Category:Destiny (series) Category:Video games using Havok Category:Loot shooters ","title":"Destiny (video game)"},{"id":"35896478","text":"Paul Skoutelas is a long time American transit manager.

Betancourt started his second presidency (his first had been under El Trienio Adeco) as a moderate, except on the issue of dictatorships, instituting the idealistic foreign policy (known as \\"the Betancourt doctrine\\") that Venezuela would not recognize dictatorial government anywhere, particularly in Latin America, but including the USSR. One significant domestic policy was land reform, with land largely from expropriated private landholdings redistributed to around 200,000 families. Betancourt's term in office saw the split of the Revolutionary Left Movement from Democratic Action in 1960, several brief military rebellions, and the development of a guerrilla movement that included the Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN). Betancourt survived an assassination attempt on June 24, 1960, blamed on Rafael Leonidas Trujillo, dictator of the Dominican Republic. ==Foreign policy== Rómulo Betancourt and U.S. President Kennedy at La Morita, Venezuela, during an official meeting in December 1961. Kennedy embraced Betancourt's strong stance against nondemocratic governments Betancourt instituted the idealistic foreign policy that Venezuela would not recognize dictatorial government anywhere, particularly in Latin America, but including the USSR, an interpretation that pleased the United States. The \\"Betancourt doctrine\\" proved unrealistic, for Venezuelan democratization occurred in the midst of a marked tendency in the rest of Latin America towards authoritarianism. He was also unrealistic in reviving Venezuela's claim on British Guiana up to the Essequibo river (which had been settled by international arbitration half a century earlier, following the Venezuela Crisis of 1895) and he had all maps of Venezuela show this large territory as part of the country albeit as disputed. In other things, Betancourt demonstrated a realistic approach. He respected the virtual autonomy of the armed forces and he did all he could to keep on the good side of Washington. Betancourt held two particular grudges: against ex-dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez, for obvious reasons, and against Rafael Leónidas Trujillo, the Dominican dictator against whom in his youth, with José Figueres of Costa Rica, he had carried on an active subversive opposition. The first of these targets of his ire led him to undercut developmental projects which would have been beneficial to his country. His hatred for Trujillo almost cost him his life after 1960 failed bombing attack, although in the end it was Trujillo who lost his. Pérez Jiménez had gone from the Dominican Republic to Miami, but Betancourt had him accused of filching in the state treasury (justifiably, although only circumstantial evidence existed) and the Venezuelan supreme court convicted him. Venezuela asked the John F. Kennedy administration for the extradition of Pérez Jiménez, and, to everyone's surprise, the USA complied, betraying an unconditional ally it had once bestowed a Medal Merit in 1953. Pérez Jiménez was first held in the Miami county jail and was finally sent to Venezuela to finish the term in a comfortable prison. In all he spent five years in prison. Betancourt's mines and hydrocarbons minister, Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso, was responsible for conceiving and creating OPEC and the Corporacion Venezolana del Petroleo (CVP). ===Relations with Cuba=== Fidel Castro occupied Havana in Cuba on January 1, 1959 in the Cuban Revolution, shortly before Betancourt took office on the 13th of February. He was considered a reformist compared with the unscrupulous dictator Fulgencio Batista, a man who as a sergeant had carried out his first coup in Cuba back in 1933. The first sign that Castro was different from all the caudillos that Latin America had ever had, was that he ordered the public executions of over a hundred Batista soldiers and police officers, although he himself had benefited by a pardon from Batista when he had tried to take over a military barracks in 1953. Once in power, Castro never concealed his anti-Americanism and in 1961 he claimed that he was and had always been a Marxist-Leninist. Betancourt wanted to back the American proposal at an Organization of American States conference in Costa Rica to expel Cuba from that body, which was achieved, but his own foreign minister, Ignacio Luis Arcaya, refused to obey and abstained in the final vote. ==Development policy== Pérez Jiménez had left in place the basic plans and projects for the further modernization and for the heavy industrialization of Venezuela. Guayana had large iron deposits as Cerro Bolivar and San Isidro. The infrastructure for exploiting them was laid by US Steel as well as the complementary huge steelworks by Innocenti. Communications had been a priority and Venezuela was endowed with a network of roads and bridges that covered the territory where over 90% of the population lived. Half or more of these were improved surface, and all they lacked was the asphalt paving. This system linked with the many blacktops that the oil companies had built in eastern and western Venezuela. These had been traced for exploration and exploitation, but they also served for the use of the general population and were now linked to the national highway system. Pérez Jiménez had built motorways from Caracas to Valencia and from Caracas to the port at La Guaira. By 1955, one could drive from one end to the other of Venezuela in a matter of days where before it would have taken weeks - months if the rainy season hampered travel. Also, Pérez Jiménez had begun the construction of a coherent railway system, although he had not had time to do more than the railroad from Puerto Cabello to Barquisimeto. Pérez Jiménez had also created government subsidiaries, called \\"institutos autónomos\\" (autonomous institutes) — the \\"autonomous\\" was supposed to mean non-political, but its real function was to allow them to negotiate foreign loans — that were to build waterworks and electric power plants in all important urban centers. He thus had started the construction of the huge Macagua Dam on Caroni river, which in time was to provide the entire country with a reliable electric grid. Betancourt's government adopted the plans and the administrative system to carry them out that the dictatorship had left in place. But the politics of repudiation had to have its pound of flesh, and Betancourt and his cabinet also canceled some crucial public works merely because Pérez Jiménez had initiated them. The railroads were scrapped with the argument that Venezuela did not need them having so much asphalt it could expand the road network at a lower cost. Pérez Jiménez had built a large reservoir in the central llanos with the irrigation potential to make Venezuela an exporter of rice. The adecos in power built instead a small hydroelectric dam for Caracas upstream and effectively starved the rice-producing scheme which was only realized to a fraction of its planned area. In time, most of the land that would have been irrigated was converted into cattle ranches, the traditional but at that point inessential llanos economic activity. In addition to the government–financed development projects, Pérez Jiménez was not averse to protectionism and incentives to local industries, but the Betancourt government made a fetish of import substitution and instead of allowing the free importation of industrial goods for which Venezuela did not have the training, it tried to force foreign suppliers to build plants in the country for the assembly or packaging of finished products that were allowed tariff-free into the country. The automobile \\"industry\\" was the import substitution model postulated by CEPAL. Venezuela still does not manufacture car engines, and all that the Betancourt and successive governments achieved was to assemble cars, which did give some Venezuelans employment — some parts suppliers, like makers of windshields, also prospered —but made the cars more costly than if they had been imported whole from Detroit to feed Venezuela's car-mania. But economic nostrums and interventionism went beyond that. The government had opted for \\"guided planning\\", and what this meant was that businesses were strictly regulated through a system of controls that went from the permission to start one to limits on where and on how they should operate. The author of this \\"developmental strategy\\" was José Antonio Mayobre, a former communist and Betancourt's economic guru. All of this required more government employees and again, as after 1945, the Venezuelan bureaucracy bloomed, as it would go on doing with each new president until it reached its height under Carlos Andres Pérez, Betancourt's personal secretary and future president. Another trusted Betancourt minister was Leopoldo Sucre Figarella, who considered that a long bridge to complete the Caracas-Valencia motorway was unnecessarily expensive, so he had the six-lane highway constructed along the mountain contour. ===\\"Alliance for Progress\\"=== The Kennedy administration in the United States of America underwrote all the economic policies of the Betancourt government through the Alliance for Progress, which used Venezuela as the exemplar showcase for all of Latin America. The ideology behind this came in a package called \\"development economics\\" expressed in a work by the economist W.W. Rostow, who described economic progress with the \\"take-off metaphor\\": A developing economy was like an airplane that got its motors running, taxied to the head of the runway, then sped along until it took off, which was the historical moment of self-sustaining growth.Rostow, W.W., The Economics of Take-off into Sustained Growth, 1963 There were many other ideas of this sort. Another was the \\"trickle down effect\\", which posited that, as an economy developed, its lower social strata would benefit from the achievements of free enterprise. But in Venezuela free enterprise was a very relative concept because of the proliferation of government regulations, not that Betancourt had anything like a \\"command economy\\" in mind, for the rights of private property were never meddled with. The trickle down effect took the form of political clientelism through which state hand-outs and local state-created posts, some purely nominal, were financed at the lower pardo levels. This was not only the rule in the Caracas shantytowns but also in the rural and semi- rural areas where adeco loyalties were firm. The Betancourt government expanded educational facilities of all sorts on a large scale. New universities were created; vocational and craft schools were founded. Pérez Jiménez's immigration policy was halted. Paradoxically, Venezuelans were not doing basic jobs, such as plumbing and carpentry, and a new and larger wave of immigration swept over the country mainly from Colombia, much of it illegal. Venezuela became for its neighbor what the USA was for Mexico. There was no pardo discrimination — as such this had never existed in Venezuela — but when it came to upper echelon positions in and out of the government, Venezuelan whites and foreigners were generally preferred to the average Venezuelan.Martz, John D., Accion Democratica: Evolution of a Modern Political Party in Venezuela, 1966 ===Land reform=== During the brief first period of democracy (El Trienio Adeco, 1945–48), the Democratic Action government had redistributed land which it said had been gained illicitly by members of previous governments,Alexander, Robert. \\"Nature and Progress of Agrarian Reform in Latin America.\\" The Journal of Economic History. Vol. 23, No. 4 (Dec., 1963), pp 559-573. and in mid-1948 it enacted an agrarian reform law. However most of the land redistributed in this way was returned to its previous owners during the 1948-58 dictatorship of Marcos Pérez Jiménez. After the 1958 restoration of democracy brought Betancourt to office again, a new land reform law was enacted in March 1960, with reform in the early 1960s concentrated in the northeastern states of Miranda, Aragua and Carabobo, and coming largely from expropriated private landholdings. The reform was accompanied by a considerable increase in agricultural production. Ultimately the reform saw about 200,000 families receive transfers of land, largely in the early 1960s.Gregory Wilpert, \\"Land for people not profit in Venezuela\\", in Peter Rosset, Raj Patel, Michael Courville, Land Research Action Network (2006), Promised land: competing visions of agrarian reform. Food First Books. p251 ==Internal unrest== Bombardment of Solano Castle during the Porteñazo rebellion But Betancourt in power primarily faced the problem of merely surviving, even in a personal sense. The underlying cause of the instability was that the 1958 elections had settled the issue of who had the right to govern democratically, but this was not as many disgruntled officers saw it because they still felt very strongly that it was the armed forces and not the \\"people\\" who had overthrown Pérez Jiménez. This created an indescribable mélange of partisans of Pérez Jiménez, rightists who were calling Betancourt a communist in disguise, and new insubordinate officers who were clamoring for a \\"real revolution\\". During his first year in power Betancourt was the object of an assassination attempt through a remote-control car bomb. He suffered minor lesions. The Dominican dictator Trujillo, who himself was assassinated by his own disaffected officers in 1961, was blamed, but the actual perpetrators were Venezuelans. Then, military insurrections in Barcelona (1961), Carúpano and in Puerto Cabello, which were supposed to take place simultaneously in 1962, instead followed upon each other.Duarte Parejo, Asdrubal, El carupanazo, 2005 The promoter among the military of these rebellious movements was a then little-known personage called Manuel Quijada. The military held their part of the 1958 agreement with Betancourt and suppressed them. But the strangest of all the movements against Betancourt, and the least effectual — although El Carupanazo (Carúpano) and El Porteñazo (Puerto Cabello) can only be described as aberrations — came from the communist left. Venezuelan leftists, and especially the communists, were watching Fidel Castro in Cuba, and they came to the conclusion, not entirely unlike that of the rightist officers who had plotted against Betancourt, that the 1958 \\"revolution\\" had been hijacked at its most popular and effervescent and that they were going to attempt a repeat of Castro's Cuban Revolution. Urban guerrillas were formed even as in Congress leftists were clamoring against Betancourt. The Revolutionary Left Movement split from Democratic Action in 1960 and later supported the Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN). The subversive cells carried out some sensational acts, one being the daylight robbery of an exhibition of Impressionist painters sponsored by France at the Venezuelan art museum. In another more deadly action they shot and killed eight Venezuelan soldiers in the back to steal their weapons. Betancourt put his aide Pérez in charge of repression. The leftist deputies were arrested, and the urban insurrection was brought under control, but the communists and their leftist allies took to the hills with the intention of repeating the pattern of Castro's rural guerrillas. Carlos Andrés Pérez, later twice President of Venezuela, was Minister of the Interior during this time (1959-1964)James D. Henderson, Helen Delpar, Maurice Philip Brungardt, Richard N.

It appears as a segment of Whitecross Street on the 1610 map of the town by cartographer John Speed and is within the medieval town walls. On more recent maps, it extends from St James Square southwest to Almshouse Street. In 2010, the street was the site of discovery of Mesolithic era artefacts. St James Street is lined with numerous listed buildings. ==History and location== By the 14th century, a portion of the street plan of Monmouth had been determined. St James Street is located within the medieval walls of the town, built around 1300. It is depicted on the map of Monmouth (pictured below) created by John Speed in 1610. However, it is not referred to as St James Street on the map. Rather, as discussed by author William Meyler Warlow in 1899, Whitecross Street extended from Church Street all the way to Weirhead Street. Not only was St James Street part of Whitecross Street, so was Almshouse Street. St James Street is a more recent title. Further, the author relates that Whitecross Street derived its name from a white cross which was positioned in the future St James Square near the Dispensary. Inspection of Speed's map reveals the symbol of a cross near East Gate (Dixton Gate), at the expected level of St James Square. St James Street intersects with the eastern end of St James Square, extending southwest to continue as Almshouse Street. The southern portion intersects with Wyebridge Street from the east. Beyond that, the southern tip of the street also intersects with St Mary's Street from the west. The buildings along the northwest side of St James Street are somewhat more ornate than those on the opposite side. On 8 November 2010, the BBC News reported that during the course of gas main replacement work at nearby St James Square and Wyebridge Street, Mesolithic era artefacts, including flints, were excavated (link to photograph of flints below). This represented the first discovery of Mesolithic human settlement in Monmouth. An article by Sion Morgan of the Western Mail which also ran on 8 Nov 2010 in Wales Online suggested that similar artefacts were found in St James Street as well. ==The buildings== 1610 Map of Monmouth by John Speed with symbol of cross near Dixton Gate (labeled M) The Queens Head at 1 St James Street is a 16th or 17th-century, grade II listed building. While the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales and author John Newman indicate that it was constructed in 1630, other sources suggest that it was built in the 16th century. Oliver Cromwell (25 April 1599 - 3 September 1658) is reputed to have frequented the accommodations at the Queens Head, and to have been the object of an assassination attempt at the inn. The building, which is on the southeast side of the street, was renovated in 1922. At that time, it received a timbered facade from Harry A. Dancey of Gloucester. The oriel window was present before the 1922 updating. The interior has an early 17th-century plaster ceiling. The building was listed on 27 June 1952, in part for the nature of its east gable end. In 2005, a group of Monmouth business people entered into a joint venture and assumed the tenancy of the building to form a community pub. The Queens Head currently serves as a public house, live music venue, restaurant, and bed and breakfast, and is run by only one member of the original, 2005 group. Clent House at 5 St James Street is a late 18th-century, grade II listed building. The three- storey, brick house is remarkable for a pedimented, Doric entrance with a fanlight. The slate roof has a single dormer. The building was grade II listed on 27 June 1952. The Grange at 12-16 St James Street consists of three connected buildings, all grade II listed, on the northwest side of the street. The three-storey, five-bay, main building features a pedimented, Doric entrance with a transom and a firemark. The 18th-century, listed building has a slate roof. The Grange, until recently one of the schools of the Haberdashers' Company, has served as a preparatory school for boys ages seven to eleven. In August 2010, the Monmouthshire County Council released details of an application to convert the prep school to a boarding house. In December 2010, it was announced that permission for the redevelopment of the school as a boarding house had been granted. The conversion of The Grange is a component of the first phase of The Heart Project, a substantial renovation of Monmouth School which has recently been undertaken. The new boarding house opened in September 2011. 18 St James Street, on the northwest side of the street, is described by author Newman as \\"something out of the ordinary.\\" The 19th- century, three-storey building features a pedimented entrance with a radiating bar fanlight. The Ionic columns have angled volutes and the door is asymmetrically positioned. The Hame on St James Street is also referred to as Kingdom Hall in one record. The early 19th-century, two-storey, listed building has a stucco exterior and a slate roof. It was grade II listed on 27 June 1952. Kingdom Hall, a listed building on St James Street, is home to the Jehovah's Witnesses. The Monmouth Methodist Church, also referred to as the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, wasn't built until 1837, although the congregation had purchased a parcel of land at St James Street for £500 at the turn of the 19th century. At that time, various Monmouth congregations were outgrowing their chapels. The building was designed by architect George Vaughan Maddox, who utilized a similar design for the Masonic Hall on Monk Street in 1846. By law, denominations that were considered to be Nonconformist were required to site their buildings in an inconspicuous area behind buildings along the street. The Methodist chapel was considered Nonconformist and, therefore, was set back from the street. (The regulation may have initially been enacted to target Catholics.) The building underwent renovation of its interior in 1885, including raising of the floor, to reduce the dominance of the pulpit. The Methodist chapel has a classical design with a gable entrance. The exterior is stucco, and there is a pedimented facade with a three-bay elevation, and Ionic columns at the ground and upper levels. The ground level windows are rectangular and pedimented, while the upper level windows are round-headed. The interior features Ionic columns, a prominent pulpit, coved ceilings, and high windows. The building was grade II* listed on 27 June 1952. Listing information indicates that it has \\"exceptional architectural interest as an important historic building with a well preserved interior.\\" In September 2011, the Monmouth Methodist Church was one of the participants in \\"Open Doors 2011, European Heritage Days in Wales,\\" welcoming members of the community into their facilities. 21 St James Street is a 19th-century, listed building. The three-storey, one bay elevation features an exterior which is stucco on the ground floor and roughcast on the upper levels. The entrance is to the right, with a canted bay to the left. 23 and 25 St James Street were grade II listed on 15 August 1974. ==Gallery== File:Queens Head Monmouth.jpgQueens Head, 1 St James Street File:16 Monmouth Methodist Church HTsmall.jpgMethodist Church, St James Street File:The Grange, St James Street, Monmouth.jpgThe Grange, 12-16 St James Street == References  External links == * Photograph of Mesolithic flints Category:Streets and squares in Monmouth, Wales Category:Archaeological sites in Monmouthshire Category:Stone Age sites in Wales Category:Prehistoric Wales ","title":"St James Street, Monmouth"},{"id":"35896701","text":"Rasmus Morten Andersen (25 September 1861 – 28 February 1930) was a Danish sculptor.

Luken Communications agreed to purchase six TV stations from Equity Media for $17.5 million and paid a $5 million installment with the rest pending on regulatory approval. In June 2008, Equity sold to Luken Retro Television Network for $18.5 million and $8.05 million Equity warrants for $1.5 million. On January 4, 2009, a contract conflict between Equity and Luken Communications interrupted RTN programming on many of its affiliates with Luken alleging that Equity had left many obligations to RTN's creditors, including programming suppliers, unpaid. As a result, Luken restored a national feed of the network from its Chattanooga headquarters. As a result of this dispute, Luken pulled out of a deal to purchase Equity's stations in southwestern Florida. In June 2009, Luken and Seals Entertainment Company LLC launched the male-oriented digital multicast channel Tuff TV. On March 22, 2011, Luken became part-owners of My Family TV in a joint venture with existing owner ValCom (the network later rebranded as The Family Channel after ValCom and Luken Communications ended their partnership). In June 2011, Luken Communications announced the purchase of 78 low-power translator stations from the Minority Media and Telecommunications Council for $390,000; the purchase was made in order to expand coverage of its ten existing and planned digital multicast networks with hopes to eventually acquire 400 low-power stations. In late summer 2011, Luken and Classic Media launched PBJ, featuring classic children's programs from the Classic Media library. With Frost Cutlery's shopping network and outdoor shows, Luken launched in 2011 the Frost Great Outdoors network. On April 16, 2012, Luken Communications and Jim Owens Entertainment announced that the companies had teamed to relaunch The Nashville Network as a digital broadcast television network set for a late summer 2012 launch (TNN previously existed as a cable channel started by Gaylord Entertainment Company in 1983). The network was rebranded the next year as The Heartland Network. On June 21, 2013, an Arkansas jury awarded a $47.4 million verdict against Luken Communications for a claim of fraudulent transfer of the ownership of RTV six years prior. In order to appeal, Luken Communications filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a protection measure.Luken Communications files bankruptcy after Arkansas jury verdict against company, June 23, 2013 The appeal spanned more than a year but was ultimately successful, and in October 2014, the company announced it was emerging from bankruptcy protection and continued to grow and expand its network offerings. In December 2014, Luken Communications launched a new digital network, Rev'n, with a focus on automotive enthusiasts. In December 2019, Luken Communications rebranded as Reach High Media Group, as Joel Wertman had by then taken over as President and CEO of the company from Luken. ==Assets owned by Reach High Media GroupDigital multicast networks=== *The Family Channel *Heartland, formerly the Nashville Network *Retro TV *The Action Channel *Rev'n ===Broadcast television stations=== Notes: All stations are owned by Digital Networks, LLC.

She attended college at Gordon College in Wenham, Massachusetts and was a law student for three years in New York City. She made the transition into music after finding an old banjo her father, documentary film maker Stan Woodward, had bought but had never taken much interest in. In an interview, she spoke of the moment of inspiration saying (quote), \\"It really wasn't until I found the banjo that I got serious about it. I was home one Christmas and I found this banjo under the bed. I just started playing it and fell in love with it.\\" The banjo's make was a Gibson from the early 1960s, and Woodward describes it as her main instrument she writes (her music) on \\"exclusively\\". ==Music career== The early roots of Woodward's career began in Boston, where she performed her first shows in Cambridge and Somerville. However, personal issues conflicting her new music career led to her moving to New York and applying for law school there. After settling down in a community house in Manhattan, she started performing at small-time gigs around town. The \\"Sidewalk Cafe\\" restaurant/bar was where she frequented and participated in the open mic nights held there. She later ventured out to perform at other public venues such as Banjo Jim's, the American Folk Art Museum, Pete's Candy Store, and The Living Room. After completing a year of law school, Woodward headed down south to perform the Kerrville Folk Festival in the Texas hill country. It was at that time she decided that she would make a full career out of her music. At the festival, Woodward met with other music artists who now comprise the record label Constant Clip Records, and she continues to collaborate them in producing new albums and singles to this day. ==Acclaim== Woodward's very first studio album, \\"Speck,\\" was released in the spring of 2009 through Constant Clip Records. She set out on her first tour a day after graduating from law school. It was a three-month-long journey across the United States with three friends and musical comrades. The tour covered New York, Texas and Seattle. Since the release of \\"Speck\\", she has performed across the United States and in other countries such as Denmark, Germany, France, and Switzerland. In 2009, she signed on to YNM management, and has performed on radio shows (NPR, college radio, and Adult Album Alternative stations), for video blogs, and festivals (SXSW, Old Songs Festival, and the Oregon Country Fair). Woodward's music has been played by over 200 college radio stations in the United States and Canada. Her songs have been featured on season six of Fox's, \\"So You Think You Can Dance\\" as well as on national television in Australia. The title track of her album, \\"Speck\\", is on the soundtrack for The Fat Boy Chronicles, a feature film by Tin Roof Films.

The battle occurred in the context of the Ghazws of Hisham I against the Christian rebels of the northern Iberian Peninsula. The battle took place near the Río Burbia, in the area which is today known as Villafranca del Bierzo. The battle resulted in a victory for the Emirate of Cordoba. ==The battle== The Emir, in his attempt to annex the Kingdom of Asturias, organized two armies for the purpose of enforcing this annexation. The first army was tasked with conquering Galicia, and the second with conquering western Basque lands. When Hisham I was returning to Córdoban territory with the spoils of his conquests, the Asturian army attacked. The Cordoban army, under the competent leadership of general Yusuf ibn Bujt, were able to successfully repel the attack and to further turn the ambush into a victory. == Consequences == The retreat of the Asturian army provoked the abdication of King Bermudo in favor of Alfonso II of Asturias, son of King Fruela I of Asturias, grandson of Alfonso I of Asturias, and great-grandson of Pelagius of Asturias.

The $2 billion tower was to be the centerpiece of the Khazar Islands, a $100 billion city of 41 artificial islands that will spread 3,000 hectares over the Caspian Sea. The city is being planned to house 1 million residents, contain 150 schools, 50 hospitals and daycare centers, numerous parks, shopping malls, cultural centers, university campuses, and a Formula 1 quality racetrack. All of these facilities are planned to be able to withstand up to magnitude 9.0 earthquakes. The city will be equipped with 150 bridges and a large municipal airport to connect the islands to the mainland. Ibrahim told reporters that American, Turkish, Arab and Chinese investors have already shown their interest in the project that will be, in his words, like a \\"new Venice\\". Construction on the Azerbaijan Tower was planned to begin in 2015 and be completed by around 2019. Later, this construction project was cancelled.

The project is considered the first privately financed joint venture 'build-operate-transfer' (BOT) hydropower project in Laos. It has installed capacity of , almost all of which is exported to Thailand. ==Design== The dam and plant design follows a format common to many dams in Laos (similar to, for example, the Nam Theun 2 Dam and the Nam Theun-Hinboun Dam), and involved an inter-catchment water transfer, between the Houay Ho River, and a small tributary of the Xe Kong River, exploiting the altitudinal difference between the two to generate power. The turbine array comprises two Francis Type turbines of 75 MW each, and a single Pelton Type turbine of 2.1 MW. ==History== The initial partnership involved in the development of this project comprised Daewoo E&C; (60%), Électricité du Laos (20%) and Loxely PLC (20%), a Thai development firm. Construction started in 1993, with the development of a access road. The consortium was granted a 30-year BOT concession agreement from the Government of Laos to develop the hydroelectric resources of the Bolaven Plateau, hitherto untapped. In September, 1993, the Houay Ho Power Company (HHPC) was established, with registered offices in Thailand, and the BOT agreement between the parties signed the same month (covering a period between 1999-2029); in June 1997, the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) was signed, and construction was completed in September 1999. Under the PPA, HHPC must supply 394.2 GWh annually, to Thailand. In 2007, the value of electricity sales from HHPC was US$23.51 million, and gross profit was US$13.2 million. {  - ! Year !! Electricity supplied by Houay Ho Dam to EGAT, 2002-2007 (GWh) - 2002  573 - 2003  423 - 2004  394 - 2005  420 - 2006  461 -  2007  473 } Emerging from the 1997 Asian economic crisis, however, Daewoo E&C; and Loxley, found themselves seriously weakened, indebted, and overextended, and both companies soon attempted to liquidate many of their overseas assets, including the Houay Ho Dam. In January 2002, Tractebel Electricity and Gas International, a Belgian firm, and a Thai firm, MCL, purchased 80% of Daewoo’s and Loxely PLC’s shares and debts for US$140 million, while the Lao Government retained the remainder. Tractabel is a subsidiary of GDF Suez. A syndicate of Thai banks provided financing, and the Belgian Export Credit Agency (ONDD), provided political coverage in support of Tractebel. In January, 2002, the dam's ownership changed once again with the purchase of 60% of its shares by GDF Suez; and then again in May 2009, with the purchase of 67% of the company's shares by GDF subsidiary, Glow Energy. The company, in addition to its Thai-registered offices, now has offices in Vientiane, Laos. Its current ownership configuration comprises Glow Energy (67.25%), Électricité du Laos (20%), and Hemaraj Land & Development (12.75%). The Glow Energy and Hemaraj Land & Development have a close association, with other joint ventures in the energy sector, based in Thailand. The company is Thailand's third largest energy producer, and supplies some 7-8% of the country's electricity. ==Controversies== In 2004, a Belgian NGO, Proyecto Gato, a Belgian NGO, filed a complaint under the OECD's Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, arguing that Tractebel should be held responsible for adequate compensation to the people forced to move to make way for the dam. Around 3,000 people from 12 villages were forcibly evicted to make way for the Houay Ho Dam, because they lived in the watershed area. Proyecto Gato also asked Tractebel to make basic health care, educational equipment and medicine available to the resettled villagers. In April 1994, the project developer (Daewoo) conducted the pre- feasibility study noting the major environmental and social impacts of the project and suggesting possible mitigation measures. Statistics on socio- economic conditions were, however, too general for planning and it appears that no information was gathered from the impacted villages or the surrounding areas. The Preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) also recommended a Resettlement Plan, watershed management and environmental monitoring. Only the first recommendation was followed up by the Government of Laos. Irrespective, a key problem in all of this was that the Preliminary EIA was conducted only after construction of the dam had begun. The Preliminary EIA recommended two villages for relocation: the first was Ban Thang Ngao due to the expected loss of its fisheries; and Ban Nam Han due to inundation. When the resettlement plan was implemented, however, it deviated substantially from the recommendations of the Houay Ho EIA. Ultimately, all villages in the Houay Ho catchment area, together with all of those in the catchment of the adjacent proposed Xe Pian-Xe Namnoy hydropower scheme (which Glow also has an interest in), were relocated to a resettlement site at Houay Kong in Pakxong District, some west of the dam. In part, this was because of Lao Government 'Focal Zone development strategies', which combine the aims of reducing Swidden agriculture with the relocation of villages to the proximity of roads to provide services and to promote 'national integration' (most of the people relocated belong to minority ethnic groups). The Pakxong District Focal Zone came into effect after the project had already been designed and it would appear that the provincial government attempted to utilize project funds for establishing coffee plantations on the Bolaven Plateau. The Provincial Rural Development Committee drew up a Resettlement Action Plan outlining major strategies for relocation, land allocation, infrastructure and service improvements and the promotion of coffee production, utilizing approximately 57 percent of the Rural Development Funds for the whole province. Twelve Nya Heun villages were relocated into an area adjacent to Lavaen villages. The mixing of these ethnic groups created tension and conflict over land. The Nya Heun is a very small ethnic group (4,200) and have been classified as ‘vulnerable’ due to their small population, relative isolation and dependence on forestry resources for subsistence. Relocating them outside their traditional forests has had a significant negative impact on their culture and traditional way of life. The consultation process was weak and involved discussions with only their leaders – most people did not want to relocate and leave their homes unnecessarily. Inadequate funds and planning resulted in food shortages that were only remedied by food donations by an international NGO. There was inadequate provisions for potable water and capacity building for local authorities, and an over-reliance on cash compensation, cash crop production and providing services and infrastructure. Despite the recommendations of the EIA consultants and the fact that livestock rearing has been a key element of their livelihood systems, no provision for livestock or grazing areas were made at the new resettlement sites, in the hope that villagers would sell off their animals. Animals remain in the catchment area near original villages. In addition to these apparent resettlement deficiencies, the release of turbinated water into the Xe Kong River has led to the drying up of the Houay Ho River for some downstream of the dam. The village of Ban Than Ngao, about down-stream has been severely impacted by the loss of water and fishing opportunities. Houay Ho was funded using balance sheet financing, meaning that the investor (Daewoo) was able to finance the entire project from existing fund reserves and/or credit lines. This allowed for a very short preparatory phase, during which time construction actually commenced on the basis of incomplete and uncertain technical, environmental and financial information. As a consequence, the project provides the Government of Laos with less foreign exchange earnings than had been initially anticipated, while placing the onus of resettlement and compensation on the Government. A final criticism of the project was (and remains) the lack of transparency in its planning and subsequent environmental and social programs. Its EIA remains unavailable to public scrutiny. The Belgian national contact point for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, in its consideration of the complaint brought by Projecto Gato against Tractebel, concluded that Tractebel could not be held responsible for the deficiencies and oversights of the project's previous owners. The fate of villagers moved from the Houay Ho's catchment area is currently unclear. Tractebel, in an apparent effort to improve its image, responded soon after this decision by supporting repairs to the old school in the resettlement area, and the construction of a new school valued at US$30,000. The company also refurbished the health center in the resettlement area and the road between Houay Kong Village and the resettlement site, at a cost of US$50,000. Finally,Tractebel fixed the broken wells in the resettlement area and constructed six toilets in six villages, at a total cost of US$15,600. ==See also== * Mekong * Mekong River Basin Hydropower ==References *International Rivers *CPWF-Mekong *3S Rivers Protection Network *Department of Energy Promotion and Development (EPD), Ministry of Energy and Mines (Lao PDR) *Electricité du Laos *Electricity Authority of Cambodia *Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand *Greater Mekong Sub-region *Lao National Mekong Committee *Living River Siam *WWF Greater Mekong Programme Category:Dams completed in 1999 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1999 Category:Dams in the Mekong River Basin Category:Dams in Laos Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Laos Category:Concrete-face rock-fill dams Category:Buildings and structures in Attapeu Province Category:Dam controversies Category:1999 establishments in Laos ","title":"Houay Ho Dam"},{"id":"35897035","text":"Hide & Seek is a 2007 Philippine horror film directed by Rahyan Carlos. ==Plot== Oliver Aliciano (Eric Quizon), a college professor, began to leave Manila with his wife Leah (Jean Garcia), his rebellious stepdaughter Nica (Jennica Garcia) and her young brother Uno (Julijo Pisk) after he was blamed on the death of Ella Cabuena (Valeen Montenegro), Nica's best friend.

He served as the Provincial Governor of Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces, Viceroy of Huguang and Liangjiang, and as a member of the Grand Council. ==Life== Sun Yuting was from Jining, Shandong Province. He sat for the palace-level imperial examination in 1775 and obtained the position of a tong jinshi chushen (third class graduate). He was admitted to the Hanlin Academy, where he served as a shujishi (). In August 1802, he was promoted from buzhengshi (布政使; Lieutenant-Governor) of Hubei Province to Provincial Governor of Guangxi Province. On 29 October 1803, he was reassigned to serve as the Provincial Governor of Guangdong Province. Around December 1804, he was transferred back to Guangxi, but was relocated back to Guangdong on 4 July 1805 until 1808. In 1810, Sun Yuting was appointed as the Provincial Governor of Yunnan Province before he was later promoted to Viceroy of Huguang and then Viceroy of Liangjiang. In March 1821, while serving as Viceroy of Liangjiang, he was also given the honorary title of Assisting Grand Secretary (). In August 1824, he was promoted to Grand Secretary of Tiren Cabinet (). However, he was subsequently dismissed from office in 1824 due to a breach in the Yellow River embankment, which was under his supervision. In July 1825, Sun Yuting was restored to the civil service as a bianxiu (編修; compiler and editor) in the Hanlin Academy under the xiuzhi () system for retired officials. In 1834, he was awarded the privilege of wearing the hat of a fourth-grade official. He died in the same year at the age of 82. During his tenure as Provincial Governor of Guangdong, Sun Yuting put down the Shantou clan fights and tried to eliminate the practice of bribing pirates into submitting to the government. In 1802, as Provincial Governor of Guangxi, he urged the Qing imperial court to recognise Fu Yang, the de facto king of Annam, and allow Annam to be again called Nanyue. In 1816, when Lord Amherst visited the Jiaqing Emperor's court as England's ambassador extraordinary to China, Sun Yuting advised the Jiaqing Emperor to exempt Amherst from the customary prostrations and kowtowing for foreign ambassadors to the Emperor. At the same time, he assured the Jiaqing Emperor that the English could not live without tea, and that to prohibit tea exports from China would soon bring England to its knees. ==Family== Sun Yuting's family was an elite family of scholar-bureaucrats who served in high-ranking positions in the Qing government for over three generations. Since 1804, they had also been running a family business, Yutang Jiangyuan (), which is now known as the Jining Yutang Sauce and Pickles Shop Co., Ltd.. Sun Yuting's father, Sun Kuotu (), obtained a juren position in the imperial examination in 1735. He served as the Magistrate () of Qiantang County (錢塘縣; now part of Hangzhou) and was a friend of the painter Zheng Xie. Sun Yuting's eldest son, Sun Shanbao (孫善寶; 1772–1853), obtained a juren position in the imperial examination and served as a Vice Secretary of Justice and Provincial Governor of Jiangsu Province. Sun Yuting's second son was Sun Renrong (). Sun Renrong's son, Sun Yuyan (孫毓溎; 1802–1867), emerged as the top candidate in the imperial examination in 1844 and served as the anchashi (按察使; Provincial Judicial Commissioner) of Zhejiang Province. Sun Yuting's third son, Sun Ruizhen (孫瑞珍; 1783–1858), obtained a jinshi position in the imperial examination in 1823 and served in the Hanlin Academy and as Secretary of Revenue. Sun Ruizhen's son, Sun Yuwen (孫毓汶; 1833–1899), obtained the second highest position in the imperial examination in 1856 and served as Secretary of Defence and head of the Zongli Yamen (Foreign Affairs Ministry). One of Sun Ruizhen's grandsons, Sun Ji (孫楫; 1827–1902), obtained a jinshi position in the imperial examination in 1852 and served as the Prefect of Shuntian Prefecture. ==References== Category:1752 births Category:1834 deaths Category:Politicians from Jining Category:Chinese government officials Category:Qing dynasty politicians from Shandong Category:Political office-holders in Jiangsu Category:Political office-holders in Guangdong Category:Political office-holders in Guangxi Category:Grand Secretaries of the Qing dynasty Category:Assistant Grand Secretaries Category:Viceroys of Huguang Category:Viceroys of Southern Rivers Category:Viceroys of Liangjiang ","title":"Sun Yuting"},{"id":"35897101","text":"Maiestas antea is a species of bug from the Cicadellidae family that is endemic to Congo.

He then took a graduate degree from Pittsburgh Theological Seminary. Second Presbyterian Church in Chicago, where Wishart was pastor from 1914 to 1919. He was ordained as a minister of the United Presbyterian Church of North America in 1897. In 1897, he founded 11th United Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh, serving as its pastor until 1910. He served as president of the National Young Peoples Christian Union in 1897. From 1910 to 1914, he was a professor of systematic theology at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary. In 1914, Wishart became the pastor of Second Presbyterian Church in Chicago, joining the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America at this time. He held this position until 1919. During this time, he served as a lecturer at McCormick Theological Seminary from 1915 to 1917.

The instructor of the biology and zoology courses took pains to argue the compatibility of evolution and Christianity, but William Jennings Bryan denounced evolution when he came to Wooster in 1923, declaring that \\"it is better to know the Rock of Ages than the age of rocks.\\" Wishart defended the teaching of evolution at the college, and the issue became heated. At the 1923 General Assembly met in May, 1923, in Indianapolis, Indiana, the college's position and Bryan's disagreement with it were widely known. The New York Times reported that the nominations of Bryan and Wishart meant that \\"in a measure, the Presbyterian Church is being divided into evolutionists and anti- evolutionists.\\" Bryan led on the first two ballots, but on the third ballot, two candidates from California withdrew and threw their support to Wishart, giving him a 451 to 427 victory. ==Chief Publications== * The God of the Unexpected Wooster, OH: Wooster College Press, 1923. * The New Freedom in the Natural Order.

The companies annual earnings are approximately US$150 million. Its main customers include Caterpillar and General Motors. ==History== Dayco was founded in 1905 as Dayton Rubber Manufacturing Co. by Col. J. C. Hooven in Ohio. The company initially made products such as garden hoses out of natural rubber. In 1908, the company hired John A. MacMillan, and began creating his product, the airless tire. The company also produced the first whitewall tires in 1913. Beginning in the early 1920s, the company entered a diversification period when it radically increased the variety of its products. Dayco would eventually make many different rubber parts, as well as some textiles. It also pioneered some synthetic rubber products, including developing the first synthetic rubber tire. The company would be a valuable supplier of military products during World War II. The company officially changed its name to the DAYCO Corporation in 1960. ==Controversies== Dayco filed for bankruptcy protection in April 2009, and emerged from bankruptcy approximately 6 months later. It eliminated about $750 million in debt during the bankruptcy. In 2015, Dayco attracted controversy when it announced it would be closing its two Distribution Centers in North Carolina and one in Nevada. Dayco was consolidating into its Memphis, Tennessee Distribution Facility. The move attracted media attention and resulted in several hundred jobs being lost. ==References * Official website Category:Automotive companies of the United States Category:Manufacturing companies based in Michigan Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1905 Category:1905 establishments in Ohio ","title":"Dayco"},{"id":"35897242","text":"Maurice Bramley (11 September 1898 – 15 June 1975), was a New Zealand born Australian cartoonist and commercial artist. ==Biography== Maurice William Bramley was born in New Plymouth, New Zealand, on 11 September 1898, the eldest son of William Bramley. He migrated to Australia in the mid-1920s, settling in Sydney. Bramley came to prominence as a commercial artist/illustrator during the 1930s, working principally for Sun Newspapers (later Associated Newspapers) magazines such as The World's News and Woman and Woman's Budget, before commencing his long association with the Transport Publishing Company (later Horwitz Publications) during the mid-1940s. John Ryan, in his Australian Comic anthology, Panel by Panel, describes Bramley as a \\"meticulous draftsman, whose detailed pen work and realistic drawings were a cut above many of the illustrators in the field.\\" During the Second World War Bramley worked for the Department of National Service producing recruiting posters. One of which 'Join Us in a Victory Job' (published in 1943), was subsequently used as a postage stamp in 1991. After the conclusion of his magazine illustration work, Bramley turned to comics, illustrating scores of comic book covers (and short filler stories) for Horwitz Publications' range of comics. These comics were predominantly US reprints, ranging from war (Combat Kelly, Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos), westerns (Kid Colt, Two- Gun Kid) (published from the late 1950s) to superhero titles (published in the early 1960s), drawing the 'silver age' of Marvel superheroes, such as Iron Man, Thor and The Incredible Hulk. As well as Horwitz and Page Publications comic covers, he worked on issues of Frogman, Navy Combat and The Phantom Commando, taking over the later from John Dixon. Dixon was only able to write the first three issues before handing the responsibility over to Bramley, who continued to draw it on an irregular schedule until 1965. Toby Burrows in Comics in Australia and New Zealand describes him as follows, \\"As a straight illustrator, Bramley, can more than hold his own with those artists mentioned above [ Monty Wedd, John Dixon, Hart Amos, Stanley Pitt, Vernon Hayles, Moira Bertram and Phil Belbin], and in some cases a lot better\\". Bramley later drew some entire issues of Page Publications' The Fast Gun in the early 1970s. ===Personal=== Bramley married Adele ('Dell') Violet Cox-Taylor on 19 August 1925, using her likeness for many of the women featured in his pulp novel cover illustrations. From the 1950s until the early 1960s Bramley lived in Tuross Head, on the New South Wales coast, where he used many of the residents as models for characters appearing within his comics. Bramley appears to have retired from the commercial art field by the early to mid-1960s, although examples of his comic book westerns remained in print (principally used as 'showbag fillers') until the early 1970s. Bramley moved to the Australian Capital Territory, for medical reasons, where he later died on 15 June 1975. ==References * List of comics, written or illustrated by Maurice Bramley @ Australian Reprint Comics Category:Australian comic strip cartoonists Category:Australian illustrators Category:Australian comics artists Category:Australian cartoonists Category:New Zealand cartoonists Category:1898 births Category:1975 deaths Category:People from New Plymouth Category:New Zealand emigrants to Australia ","title":"Maurice Bramley"},{"id":"35897259","text":" P.S.

Rafael Caldera of COPEI came second. The Wolfgang Larrazábal political phenomenon was eclipsed and Jóvito Villalba on his own came just behind Caldera. AD was still the pardo party by excellence, but Caracas was definitely lost. ==Presidency== Leoni's government was unexceptional, but it was Leoni who had to liquidate the remnants of the communist insurrection, for which he put the army in charge of the country with carte blanche to be as ruthless as it had to. But in fact it was the communist guerrilleros themselves who brought about their own liquidation. They had no rural support whatsoever. Unlike guerrillas all over the world, they did not control villages and lived from hand to mouth.Zago, Angela, Aqui no ha pasado nada, 1972 They knew they were no match for the army and avoided confrontations. Castro had been hoping that Venezuela would be the second act of the Latin American revolution, and he tried to supply the Venezuelan guerrillas. This was in keeping with the theory of what could be called the \\"permanent agrarian revolution\\", which the French intellectual Régis Debray had expressed in the widely circulated book Revolution Inside the Revolution and Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara had been trying to carry out first in Africa and later, fatally for him, in Bolivia. Castro sent a trusted officer, Manuel Ochoa, to assess the Venezuelan guerrillas, and the report that he brought was negative, which effectively ended Cuba's intervention in Venezuelan affairs.Szulc, Tad, Castro: a Critical Portrait, 1986 By then the Venezuelan leftists had given up on violence and were seeking legalization, but Leoni did not offer it. Ochoa was later tried and executed by Castro on an unlikely charge of drug- smuggling. ===Cabinet=== {  - !bgcolor=\\"#dcdcdc\\" colspan=3Ministries Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Venezuela (1965).

The album was nominated for the Rock/Contemporary Album of the Year at the 43rd GMA Dove Awards. ==Critical reception== AllMusic's Jared Johnson said \\"together with a powerful rhythm section, Hancock and Clark prove they are the real thing by connecting with listeners who resonate with the struggles and prodigal cries invested in the lyrics. You get the feeling these guys know a thing or two about heartache, personal adversity, and overcoming rebellion. Kudos also for turning out a full volume of new material rather than simply retooling their EP.\\" Alpha Omega News' Rob Snyder said \\"give them credit for their first full-length debut which features all new material.\\" Further, Snyder wrote that the \\"lyrics are typically hope-filled around a theme that God can fill all of our needs, vertical but not profound. Big synths abound on \\"Innocent\\" while \\"Healing in Your Arms\\" would fit nicely on the most recent work of Rebecca St. James.\\" Lastly, Snyder stated that he \\"liked the sentiment in \\"Come Home,\\" \\"you can't outrun grace.\\" My favorite track is \\"Hope is Rising.\\"\\" CCM Magazine's Andy Argyrakis said \\"with the additional visibility comes an all-star production team of Paul Moak, Ed Cash and Ben Glover, who help direct an already solid modern rock sound laden with worshipful lyrics of abandon, surrender redemption.\\" Argyrakis wrote \\"besides their ability to instantly relate to others, these fresh faces aren't afraid to bear personal vulnerabilities, especially across the chant-heavy reflective balad, \\"Come Home\\"\\" Christian Manifesto's Lydia Akinola said \\"after first listening, one kind of feels you’ve maybe heard the album before in some previous life, they exhibit most of the aspects of conventional rock/pop album – the production, the hooks, the weird way it sounds like Tenth Avenue North meets the Afters. But with repeated listening, previously unknown layers to the music are exposed, and you have to reassess your earlier misgivings.\\" Akinola wrote that they created \\"48 minutes of top-class, excellent, inspiring, soul-stirring music is not an undemanding task. Luminate deliver an impressive effort, offering accessible music that still throws a few punches.\\" Akinola stated that \\"Come Home is not an average album. There are too many moments of excellence; there is too much that is too good to just dismiss this as another rock/pop CCM boy-band fad. It is an unashamedly an 'anthem' album, offering track after track of rousing music. I'm genuinely impressed with their fusion of accessibility and creativity. Whilst they’re only just starting out on this stage of their journey, Come Home shows that they know where their roots are. Let’s hope they build from here.\\" Christian Music Zine's Tyler Hess said \\"this is the national debut for the self labeled pop-rock band from the Lone Star State. Although, it’s much more pop than rock. It seems this was written specifically for Christian radio. It will fit right in on your Jesus-loving, soccer mom-listening, nicely complemented by the cheesy radio host, hometown station.\\" Hess wrote \\"overall, it’s well written, but there’s nothing that really will bring me back for a repeat listen. It’s a good album, but not as edgy as I prefer.\\" Christianity Today's John Brandon said \\"big drums, sincere vocals, and sing-along choruses can't quite lift Luminate into the upper echelon of must-hear worship rock. The main problem: the songwriting is not as poignant as Tenth Avenue North or Hillsong United.\\" Brandon wrote that \\"songs about forgetting who we are in Christ and turning back to him (e.g., Healing in Your Arms) help, but some of the sentiments are a little too familiar: running back to the arms of God, searching in the wrong places.\\" Brandon stated that the album has \\"good reminders, sure, but couched in a me-too worship style that feels dated. Bagpipes, a cello solo—something with the element of surprise would help.\\" Cross Rhythms' Matt McChlery said that \\"in one word: superb! If this is all you read of this review, this is the only word you need to remember. Luminate are a perfect blend of passion and rock. Sitting with ease alongside the sounds and styles of big mainstream bands such as The Fray, The Killers and Coldplay, their ambient rock sound carries their positive messages of hope and love far beyond the boundaries of the walls of the Church. 'Come Home' is masterfully produced to a very high quality with bucket loads of little musical touches and interest dotted throughout the album and anthemic choruses keep you hooked.\\" McChlery wrote that \\"if they continue to make albums as good as this one, they will be around for many more years to come!\\" Jesus Freak Hideout's Jen Rose said \\"from start to finish, Come Home is a solid album and a great introduction to those who have yet to discover Luminate. Though it may not break serious new ground or feel all that different from the genre, those craving some new music with a worshipful attitude and a soft spot for pop-friendly beats will find a fine release worth checking out.\\" Louder Than The Music's Jono Davies said that \\"I just want to point out now, before I'm accused of being negative, that I like this album. I like the catchy big choruses, but there is something more to this album than first meets the eye(or ear).\\" Davies wrote that \\"throughout the album the band talk about being made new with God, leaving issues in the past, and it's a strong theme to have running through the whole album.\\" Davies stated \\"if you liked the albums of The Afters and Brandon Heath, you will love this album. You can't fault the creative lyric writing throughout the album, with solid pop rock songs, good melodies, and good musicianship - you can see and hear that Luminate have made a solid album. This album will do well with the pop rock fans and I'm sure you will hear more of this band in the next year or so.\\" New Release Tuesday's Kevin Davis said that \\"if you like OneRepublic, The Afters, Chris Tomlin and Brandon Heath, then you’ll really enjoy this new band. They have a very polished pop sound mixed with meaningful and personal lyrics. To me, Sam Hancock is a potential male vocalist of the year and I find myself hanging on every word he sings as his vocals are passionate and reverberate from my speakers. All twelve songs are unashamed of the Gospel and this is the type of band you’ll want to tell others about.\\" Davis wrote that \\"the album could come with one of those 'satisfaction guaranteed' recommendations as the themes appeal to anyone and musically their sound is extremely radio friendly. After repeated listens, the songs get deeper into the recesses of your heart with the challenging messages. I love every song and consider them a band to watch.\\" Davies stated that he \\"consider[s] Luminate the 'next big thing' based on this excellent album, an early contender for one of my top albums of the year.\\" ==Track listingChartsAlbum=== { !Chart (2011) !Peak position - US Billboard Christian Albums align=\\"center\\" 18 - US Billboard Heatseekers Albums align=\\"center\\" 16 } ===Singles=== {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=2 Year ! rowspan=2 Single ! colspan=3 Peak chart positions - style=\\"font-size:smaller;\\" ! width=40 US Christian Songs ! width=40 US Christian CHR ! width=40 US Christian AC -  rowspan=\\"3\\" 2011  align=\\"left\\" \\"Come Home\\"  18  30  23 -  align=\\"left\\" \\"Healing in Your Arms\\"  49  19  — -  align=\\"left\\" \\"Innocent\\"  —  29  — } ==References * Allmusic Category:2011 albums Category:Sparrow Records albums ","title":"Come Home (Luminate album)"},{"id":"35897312","text":"The Battle of Paterna (Paterna, 1065) took place between the troops of the Kingdom of Leon, under the command of Ferdinand I of León and Castile, and those of the Taifa of Valencia, commanded by Abd al-Malik ben Abd al-Aziz al- Mansur. The battle occurred at the same time as the Siege of Valencia, resulted in a victory for the Kingdom of Leon. == Historical context == In 1063, Fernando I of Leon sent his son, the infante Sancho to the aid of his vassal, Ahmad al-Muqtadir, king of the Taifa of Zaragoza when his city of Graus was being besieged by the forces of Ramiro I of Aragon. Consequently, Ramiro, who was Fernando's brother, would be defeated and killed. In the aftermath of that battle, there ensued a mass slaughter of Christians. To appease public support, Ahmad al-Muqtadir stopped paying his vassal tribute to the Kingdom of Leon. King Fernando responded in 1065 by launching an expedition into the valley of the Ebro River, devastating the land and defeating al-Muqtadir, once again forcing him into a vassal state. The expedition continued on towards Valencia, governed by Abd al-Malik ben Abd al- Aziz al-Mansur, with the intent on also turning that city into a vassal state. == The battle == After besieging the city, Ferdinand I found the city's defenses to be extremely resilient and determined that it would be impossible to take them by an assault. The king therefore decided to call for a general retreat from the city. The Muslim defenders of Valencia exited the city and began to harass the retreat of the Leonese forces. At Paterna, approximately five kilometers from Valencia on the left bank of the Turia, the Leonese troops set an ambush for the pursuing forces. Catching the Valencian attackers completely by surprise, they were wiped out almost to a man. It was said that Abd al-Malik only escaped due to the speed of his horse. The poet Abu Ishaq al-Tarasuní related the occurrences of the battle in the following verses translated from Spanish: \\"The Christians were clad in bright armour, but ye were arrayed in silken robes of various colours. Partana is the spot where your valour and their cowardice became once more manifest.\\" == Aftermath == After the battle, King Ferdinand I once again resumed the siege of Valencia. Later during the siege, Ferdinand became ill and once again ordered a retreat back to León where he died on December 27 of the same year, 1065. == See also == * Ferdinand I of León and Castile * Reconquista == References == *Al- Makkari, Nafh at-tib, II, 148–9. *Ibn Idhari, al-Bayan al-Mugrib, I, 111 y III, 252–3. == Citations == Category:1065 in Europe Paterna Paterna Paterna Paterna Category:11th century in the Kingdom of León Category:11th century in Al-Andalus Category:Paterna ","title":"Battle of Paterna"},{"id":"35897339","text":"Luis Herrera Campins served as President of Venezuela from 1979 to 1984. ==Background== When the next elections came around in 1979—in Venezuela, presidents and congress were elected in the same election for five-year terms—AD fielded the unexciting Luis Piñerúa Ordaz and the COPEI selected Luis Herrera Campins. The latter did not have anything new to offer except rhetoric, but in the campaign he was like a charging boar. It really didn't matter what he said, because the adecos were in a no-win situation disillusioned as they were with Pérez and unexcited by Piñerua, and Herrera defeated his adeco adversary although not by a large majority. Venezuela had demonstrated once again that at the ballot level it was a working democracy. ==Presidency== Few presidents had practiced winner-takes-all as Herrera Campins did. Even full-blooded Social Christians who had worked for the Pérez administration were fired. But Herrera did have in his cabinet a few figures that were not copeyanos, among them Manuel Quijada, the former anti-democracy conspirator. (Later, Quijada was one of the political advisors of Chavez before the former paratrooper won the presidency.) He named the economist Leopoldo Díaz Bruzual to the Venezuelan Central Bank. Díaz Bruzual was a protégé of and advisor to Reinaldo Cervini, a very rich man who had life-time tenure at Pro-Venezuela, a kind of semi-official institute founded to promote Venezuelan industrialization. Cervini doubled as Maecenas to communist intellectuals, who would physically confront anyone who dared criticize their patron. Herrera Campins toned down the showiness of his predecessor, even though his government had another windfall when oil prices rose dramatically again in 1983. Venezuela had increased its indebtedness beyond the levels attained by the Pérez government. There was much talk at the time of \\"bipolarity\\", the belief that Venezuela was stuck forever in the cycle of AD- COPEI ruling alternatively but following the same policies of high-spending, high-bureaucracy, and a statized economy. One brash foreign policy initiative taken by Herrera either should have gladdened or encouraged militarists in Venezuela. When the Argentine military dictator and \\"dirty war\\" veteran Leopoldo Galtieri had the Falklands invaded in 1982, Venezuela officially, though not materially, backed the Argentine move, although most Venezuelans were not aware of Argentina's claim on the islands and weren't even fully informed of the government's action. When dollars flooded Venezuela again, economists began talking of \\"overheating\\", although it wasn't clear whether they knew what they were talking about. It was pseudo-technical jargon, but Díaz Bruzual was among the adherents to this idea, if not actually the economist who got the \\"overheated\\" ball rolling. In the USA, president Jimmy Carter was fighting inflationary pressures and interests rates there, and in the industrialized nations generally, went up to unheard of levels. In Venezuela, a Canadian bank was offering interests as high as 21%. But because of the overheating thesis, Díaz Bruzual applied an old law whereby interest payments above 12% were considered usurious and illegal. Dollars started flowing out of Venezuela in the billions, and the central bank, which had always been zealous about national reserves, took fright at their growing depletion, but instead of counter-acting with incentives to reverse the outward flow, the bolivar was officially devalued by over 50% on its previous 4.30 to the dollar. The government, in brief, was not going to subsidize the bolivar at its previous rate. But the measure encouraged a further massive flight of dollars, and the government then clamped full currency control. During his presidency the inauguration of Teatro Teresa Carreno and the Metro de Caracas took place, along with the presidential election of Jaime Lusinchi of Acción Democrática. === Herrera's cabinet (1979-1984) === {  - !bgcolor=\\"#dcdcdc\\" colspan=3Ministries Gaceta Oficial de Venezuela, period 1979-1984. - align=\\"left\\"OFFICEalign=\\"left\\"NAMEalign=\\"left\\"TERM - !bgcolor=\\"black\\" colspan=3 - align=\\"left\\"Presidentalign=\\"left\\"Luis Herrera Campinsalign=\\"left\\"1979–1984 - align=\\"left\\"Home Affairsalign=\\"left\\"Rafael Montes de Ocaalign=\\"left\\"1979–1982 - align=\\"left\\" align=\\"left\\"Luciano Valeroalign=\\"left\\"1982–1984 - !bgcolor=\\"black\\" colspan=3 - align=\\"left\\"External Affairsalign=\\"left\\"José Alberto Zambrano Velascoalign=\\"left\\"1979–1984 - align=\\"left\\"Financealign=\\"left\\"Luis Uguetoalign=\\"left\\"1979–1982 - align=\\"left\\" align=\\"left\\"Arturo Sosaalign=\\"left\\"1982–1984 - align=\\"left\\"Defensealign=\\"left\\"Fernando Paredes Belloalign=\\"left\\"1979 - align=\\"left\\" align=\\"left\\"Luis Rangel Burgoingalign=\\"left\\"1979–1980 - align=\\"left\\" align=\\"left\\"Tomás Abreu Rescanierealign=\\"left\\"1980–1981 - align=\\"left\\" align=\\"left\\"Bernardo Leal Puchialign=\\"left\\"1981–1982 - align=\\"left\\" align=\\"left\\"Vicente Narváez Churiónalign=\\"left\\"1982–1983 - align=\\"left\\" align=\\"left\\"Humberto Alcalde Álvarezalign=\\"left\\"1983–1984 - align=\\"left\\"Developmentalign=\\"left\\"Manuel Quijadaalign=\\"left\\"1979–1981 - align=\\"left\\" align=\\"left\\"José Enrique Porras Omañaalign=\\"left\\"1981–1984 - align=\\"left\\"Transport and Communicationsalign=\\"left\\"Vinicio Carreraalign=\\"left\\"1979–1983 - align=\\"left\\" align=\\"left\\"Francisco Lara Garcíaalign=\\"left\\"1983–1984 - align=\\"left\\"Educationalign=\\"left\\"Rafael Fernández Heresalign=\\"left\\"1979–1982 - align=\\"left\\" align=\\"left\\"Felipe Montillaalign=\\"left\\"1982–1984 - align=\\"left\\"Justice align=\\"left\\"José Guillermo Anduezaalign=\\"left\\"1979–1981 - align=\\"left\\" align=\\"left\\"J.

Social games were played at the Recreation Reserve in Andersons Creek (now Warrandyte) against neighbouring suburbs until the club entered the Cameron Cricket Association, playing its first game in competition on 11 November 1905 against Christmas Hills. Season 2010/11 was the club's 100th in competition (taking into account war periods and club disputes), and during that time over 1,300 people have played in either juniors, seniors, women's or veterans grades. The club currently competes in the Ringwood and District Cricket Association (RDCA) ==HistoryCricket on the goldfields (1855 - 1904)=== Clement Hodgkinson In February 1855, 4 years after gold was first discovered in the town, the noted early Victorian politician William Westgarth paid a visit to Warrandyte, or Anderson's Creek as the town was then frequently called. He described the village as a small mining camp stretched along about a mile of the riverbank. The number of miners did not exceed two hundred in all. A punt was established across this river, a Post Office was established, a Mining Warden was appointed, and the Lands Department has also got a map surveyed by Clement Hodgkinson which shows a ground used for cricket on the present site of the Recreation Ground. A number of pioneers of Warrandyte took a keen interest in cricket, but two in particular, Walter Charles Brackenbury and William Collins, stand out as founders of the game in Warrandyte. The earliest found match documentation was from 9 January 1864, when Bells Life in Victoria printed the complete scores of a match between Andersons Creek and Caledonia (now St Andrews), and many noted early residents took part including James Masterton, who got five wickets in each innings. Masterton owned a rich mining claim almost opposite the Old Catholic Church in Brackenbury Street. In 1856 he caused quite a stir in the Melbourne Argus when he found 12oz. of gold in a tub of quartz. Others who took part were the Squires brothers who ran the Grocers Shop in the Main Street for 40 years, which it is now the Foodlands Store, Stiggants the pioneer orchardist on Pound Road, while Ewen Hugh Cameron who later represented the district in Parliament for 40 years took two wickets for Caledonia. Anderson's Creek won a brilliant victory scoring 114 to their opponents 26 and 36. On 15 June 1864, the club applied to the Government for a permanent recreation ground. Their petition was presented by the then Mining Warden Charles Warburton Carr, and the club was granted permissive occupancy, but this was not very suitable as they were worried that the ground might be used for building purposes, and a second petition was presented on behalf of the Club by Mr. W.Watkins M.L.A. in 1866. A permanent recreation ground was then gazetted and the first trustees were appointed on 10 September 1866. They were Dr. John Elmes, Walter Pretty, William Collins, Arthur Liddlelow and Thomas Porteus. William Collins, who was a landscape gardener offered to give his services to beautify the ground, and in the early 1870s the club had a somewhat ambitious scheme to build a pavilion, fence and level the ground, and also build a bowling green. They applied to the Government for 150 Pounds towards the cost, but they got no more than a letter of acknowledgement. During 1875 and 1876, the Trustees spent the sum of 7 Pounds 3 Shillings and 9 Pence on fencing and other improvements to the ground, but there is nothing to suggest that anything in the line of a permanent pavilion had been erected. The finding of good Gold in the Mines could sometimes cause the Club to renege on their obligations. On one occasion in the 1890s, a party of gentlemen from the Croydon Club came riding into town and claimed that they had arranged a match against the Warrandyte Club and there was no one to play them. They rode off in a huff. The Warrandyte Club apologised to them in the local press, but they never came back until 1910.Cricket by the riverside by Louis R. Cranfield. During the 1880s and 1890s, regular games were played against Kangaroo Ground, Ringwood, Yarra Flats, Eltham, Lilydale, with visits from the West End Brewery from Melbourne. Many players mentioned in newspaper reports played a major part of forming the community in Warrandyte, and have has streets named after them like John Till, Edward Kruse, R.Mahoney, Henry Stiggants & John Speers, to name a few. ===The Cameron Cricket Association (1905 - 1907)=== John Till At a public sports meeting on Saturday 14 October 1905 a club committee was formed, consisting of E.H.Cameron as President, Edwards Kruse as Secretary, and George Quick as Treasurer. It was also put forward that the club join the Cameron Trophy Association, which comprised local clubs Christmas Hills, Kangaroo Ground, Caledonia & Panton Hill. A month later on Saturday 18 November heralded the day the club played its first competitive cricket match, as they took on Christmas Hills at the Warrandyte Reserve. C.Sanford topped scored with 16, leading the team to a total of just 31, then captain John Till destroyed the opposition for just 21 runs, taking 6 for 5 in the process. Warrandyte fared better in their 2nd innings making 66, but Christmas Hills turned the tables the following week, and passed the target of 80 for the loss of 6 wickets. Warrandyte would claim their first win the following game at Kangaroo Ground, with John Till again the star, top scoring with 45 and taking 9 wickets, including 5 in the opposition total of just 9 in the 2nd innings. Till would show a liking to Kangaroo Ground's bowling in their return clash in round 7 at Warrandyte Reserve, scoring the club's first ever century, and the team finished their first season with 4 wins and 4 losses, narrowly losing the Semi Final. Warrandyte would go through the following season undefeated, winning most of their games by an innings. But without finals, the premiership decider would revert to the completion of an abandoned game in round 1 against new team Yarra Glen. The game resumed after the season was finished to decide the premiers, and with Warrandyte 7/65 in their second innings, with a lead of just 55 runs, it appeared all the domination would amount to nothing. Resuming the game on 23 March 1907, Warrandyte's tail added another 19 runs, but this would prove crucial, as Yarra Glen were dismissed for just 67 in their 2nd innings, giving Warrandyte its first ever premiership by 8 runs. Earliest reference to women's cricket was noted on the ANA holiday back on 24 January 1906, when after the men played the visiting Carlton team, a ladies game was held. The locals victorious 29 runs to 19. ===The Box Hill Reporter District Cricket Association (1908 - 1932)=== Warrandyte were forced to not play in season 1907/08 after the Cameron Cricket Association disbanding due to lack of participating teams, so the club approached the Box Hill Reporter District Cricket Association in September 1908. They were initially refused entry because of the opposition clubs reluctance to travel to Warrandyte, due to its remoteness at the time, however they were accepted on 2 October on the proviso they play all their games at opposition grounds. Only Blackburn made the long trek out to Warrandyte. The step up in the standard of cricket was evident, even in the B Grade, with the club struggling against strong seasoned teams like Blackburn, Box Hill, Croydon, Doncaster, East Burwood, Ringwood & Templestowe. Most of whom have been playing since the competition started in 1890. One highlight was Thomas Schubert taking 9/17 against Templestowe in 1909, a club record that would stand until 1996, and still the best bowling figures ever at Warrandyte Reserve. The team would struggle up until World War I, but that period saw the debuts of 100 game players Les Till (John's son), Jack & William Colman, Les, Richard & Bill McCulloch and William Moore. The post war era coincided with a coming of age, as the club dominated B Grade. Season 1920/21 saw them win the premiership against Blackburn 2nd XI, and the first game of one of the club's greatest players, James Schubert, who still remains the only player to score 4,000 runs and take 400 wickets. William Colman scored 468 runs and took 90 wickets in 1922/23, which is still a record for most wickets & points in a single season. They also spasmodically fielded a 2nd XI of their own for the first time in 1925/26, while the 1st XI yo-yoed between A and B Grade. Despite the advent of the automobile in the 1920s, most locals couldn't afford one, and were forced to travel to and from grounds by either bicycle or on the back of Horrie Smith's orchard truck. For reasons not entirely clear, the club had to field its 2nd XI in the Ringwood and District Cricket Association's C Grade in 1931/32, probably due again to the distance to Warrandyte issue for opposition clubs. The reserve team lost the final, coincidentally against newly formed South Warrandyte Cricket Club's 1st XI, which from formed by Jack Colman , who played 116 games in his 18 years at the Warrandyte Cricket Club. This period saw the first games of life members John Smith in 1921/22, Jack McAuley the following season, and Horrie Smith Jnr in 1926/27. ===The Ringwood and District Cricket Association (1932 - 1948)=== The following season in 1932/33, the 1st XI also joined the RDCA, where the reserve team won its first flag in 1993/34. The club attended the association's AGM in October 1934, but were missing from the fixture a month later, and returned to the BHRDCA for one season. Then according to the Box Hill Reporter newspaper on 30 August 1935, once again they were refused entry at the AGM due to \\"inaccessibility\\", so it was back to the RDCA. 1936/37 saw the 1sts claim its first RDCA premiership, on the back of fearful fast bowler Fred Carlton's 90 wickets and 2 competition bowling awards in 2 seasons. 1 October 1938 was a red letter day in the club's history, when a 15-year-old Allan Chapman played his first game. Although being run out for just 1 at Wonga Park wasn't memorable, his legacy at the club would become indelible. He is roundly touted by those in the know as the club's greatest ever player, winning an unprecedented 7 first eleven Club Championships, and playing 1st XI cricket until the age of 48. The Chapman name would become synonymous with Warrandyte cricket, with 14 in total playing for the club, including 5 Life Members and grandson Matthew, who still plays today. Two games later another legend debuted, with Les Adams beginning his 35-year association with the club. Following two of the brightest moments was possibly its darkest, when on 13 January 1939, the Black Friday bush fires ravaged the town, destroying the clubrooms and all its equipment and memorabilia in its wake. Tragically former player Fred Topping perished defending his home. With help from The Victorian Cricket Association donating equipment, the club rebuilt and remarkably went on to win both the B and C Grade premierships in 1939/40. The 1st XI beat North Bayswater 205 & 153 to 129 & 166, while the 2nd XI easily defeated Ringwood 116 & 1/38 to 58 & 94\\\\. The club had a -year hiatus during the WW2 period, and returned to once again dominate the competition in B Grade, going undefeated until their shock loss to East Ringwood in the semi final. The promotion to A Grade saw them struggle again, and a return to B Grade in 1947/48 saw the 1st XI claim its 3rd flag in 12 seasons. The winning team consisted of Allan, Arthur, Adrian & Colin Chapman, Stan Houghton, Jim Lee, Jack McAuley, Clive & George Smith, Horace Smith Junior and Senior, and is one of the greatest to ever take the field for Warrandyte. ===Turbulent times (1949 - 1960)=== Despite being reigning premiers, the club took the extraordinary decision not to play at all the following season due to a disagreement on the captaincy. And when they reformed 1949/50, it was once again in the Box Hill league under the new name of West Warrandyte, which they kept for 5 seasons. New Years Day in 1956 was a momentous day for the club, as 2,000 spectators filled the Warrandyte Reserve to watch a game against the Victoria Cricket Association at the Warrandyte Reserve to celebrate the club's centenary. After a few postponements due to weather, many local dignitaries attended, and the V.C.A. team consisted of four former Australian test cricketers. On the following Saturday, Centenary Ball was held in the Warrandyte Mechanic Institute and it proved another fine success. The members went to considerable trouble to decorate the hall in the club colours, green and gold and at the rear of the hall was the club birthday Cake with 100 blazing candles. The highlight of the evening was the presentation of the first Life Membership medallion to Jack Moore by Councillor William F. Betton, who paid a tribute to his fine services to the people of Warrandyte both on and off the sporting field. Back row (L-R) Bill Betton (president), Graham Pike, Bill Taberner, Graham West, Ken Sargeant, Robert Stewart, Les Adams (manager) Front row (L-R) Henrique Harding, Peter Adams, Glen Martin (C), Boyd Ewing, Laurie Warr The celebrations continued the following season, when the 1st XI claimed the B Grade premiership in 1956/57 under the captaincy of Colin Chapman. The 'Dytes winning a tough contest against St Peters, 146 & 201 versus 130 & 201\\\\. That season also featured the introduction of the club's first ever junior side, an under 16s team. For the first time since the club dispute, the Warrandyte failed to produce a 2nd XI the following season, which created differing opinions on team selection. This disharmony saw Morrie Bennett, who had played a handful of games, create the North Warrandyte Cricket Club which played in the RDCA. Its future was promising, but was forced to finally abandon after just 3 seasons, due largely to the fact that the Eltham Council was unable to build the club a ground due to the hilly terrain of the area. Warrandyte was in a dire financial situation, mainly due to the centenary commitments, so major changes were needed. Under the vision of new president of William Betton, a yearly Tradesman's Directory was introduced, which after a few years became a great money spinner for the club, and is still in operation today. They also established an under 16s team in 1958/59, and by 1960/61 changed its name to Warrandyte Footballers, and its colours from green and gold to red and white. ===Struggling years (1961 - 1977)=== With most players returning from the failed North Warrandyte venture for the 1961/62 season, the club also began to see the fruits of its junior team when it fielded a 3rd eleven for the first time in 1963/64. One junior, Mark Davis, who would go on to be President and a Life Member, amassed a stunning 142 in the under 14s competition in 1965. But despite the growing numbers, the depth of quality in the 1st XI was lacking, and they failed to make the finals in every season in the 1960s. Regardless of the lack of team success, there were many momentous occasions & personal highlights. After a career span of 35 years, Allan Chapman played his 163rd and final game in the 2nd XI's semi final loss in 1973. An even greater time span was Jack McAuley's who played his last game on 13 January 1968, nearly 46 years to the day after his debut on 21 January 1922. That was a record that stood until Allan Chapman's son, John, graduated from the juniors in 1963, and brought up 50 years at the club playing veterans in 2011/12. His father-in-law, Les Adams, ended a 35-year stint, playing his last game in 1974, while his son, Peter, won an amazing 6 consecutive 1st XI bowling awards in the 1960s. And Robert White, a talented all round sportsman, joined the club in 1970, and would go on to be the leading run scorer in the 1st XI, as well as holding two stints as President. Back row (L-R) Sandra Burton, Debbie Lamb, Maria McGhee, Marg World, Robyn Dalli, Teresa Prince Front row (L-R) Sandra Jeffs, Jenny Chapman, Suzanne Chapman (captain), Jenni McLaws, Judith Davis Season 1975/76 saw some big changes. The club rejoined the RDCA and the Women's XI, not seen since the start of the 20th century, was re-established. Their success was instant, winning the Victorian Women's Cricket Association premiership in its first attempt, thus ending the club's longest ever premiership drought. Instrumental in its creation and success were sisters Susanne & Jenny Chapman, and the team would go on to play until 1992/93. ===The golden era (1977 - 1985)=== Steve Pascoe, a talented all- rounder, was recruited from the Norwood Cricket Club as the first ever captain/coach in the winter of 1977, and his professionalism and fore thinking was just what the club needed. When he arrived, the club had 3 junior and 3 senior teams, and in the space of just 6 seasons, playing numbers had doubled for both. The quality of playing stocks also improved, with the likes of Bob McDonald, Richard Bowen, Fred Jungwirth and Marty McCarthy recruited or developed from the junior ranks. Two in particular had lasting effects. Stan Davis was a brilliant on-field tactician and crafty leg spin bowler, and Bruce Kline a freakishly talented wicketkeeper, who while keeping up to the stumps to most bowlers, took a bewildering 31 stumpings and just 6 catches in one season. 13yo Brett Kline was part of the under 14s premiers in 1977/78, who would go on to become the senior games record holder in 2011, while Gerald Walshe played his first senior game in October 1978. 30 seasons later Walshe would claim a record 644 senior wickets. The foundation was laid for the 1979/80 season, one that goes down in the history books as the club's greatest. Stan Davis took over the reins of the first eleven, and immediately led them to a long-awaited premiership. Bowling first, Jungwirth's 4/39 help dismiss Ainslie Park for just 124, which was passed for the loss of just 3 wickets, with John Chapman making 66. But a middle order collapse saw them lose 7/49, and with the final spread over 3 days, the game was far from won. But Max Summers and Stan Davis shared a last wicket stand of 83 to take the game away from the opposition, and they went on to win by 10 wickets. The club achieved its only senior trifecta, with the 2nd and 3rd elevens also victorious. And capping off a stunning season, were victories to both under 12s sides that included future stars in Michael and Cameron Day, Colin Dorning, Tony Sturesteps, Darren Peters, Brendan Baker and Greg Creber. Traditionally Warrandyte's 1st XI had always struggled when promoted to the highest grade, but much confidence was gained when they finished a credible 5th out of 14 teams in its first attempt in Chandler Shield, which at the time was one of the most revered and competitive in metropolitan Melbourne. But it was a C Grade clash that received the most attention, when the 3rd XI were decimated for 53 and 42 by an Eastfield 1st XI bowler that claimed 6/15 and 9/10. His name was Graeme Lloyd. Lloyd was coming off two C Grade bowling awards in a row, and joined Warrandyte for the 1981/82 season, and went on to completely dominate the opposition. He claimed 66 wickets and won the Bill Dean Medal as the league's best player, the only time a Warrandyte player has won such an award at the highest level. He was instrumental in guiding the 1st XI to 3rd place on the ladder and finals, another first for the club. His batting however was quite the opposite. After a caught behind shout from a fast bowler, he removed his gloves and walked off. As the bemused umpire yelled out that he wasn't out, Graeme, who was halfway off the ground shouted over his shoulder, \\"Close enough for me\\". Captain Davis also had a stellar season, claiming 44 wickets himself and snatching the competition bowling award from Lloyd, whilst Robert White returned the club from a stint at District cricket, and averaged 80 with the bat. Back row (L-R) John McCartin, Brett Kline, John Chapman, Bruce Kline, Richard Bowen, Fred Jungwirth, Stephen Peake, Mark Davis, Graeme Lloyd Front row (L-R) Robert White, Ann Pascoe (scorer), Steve Pascoe, Geoff Day (President), Stan Davis (C), Dianne Gathercole (Secretary), Marty McCarthy. Warrandyte beat Croydon United in the semi final, a team that had humbled them in the final round, and faced the top side Wantirna South in the Chandler Shield final. It was uncharted territories for both clubs, and it was Warrandyte that batted first and nervously crawled to 9/120. Steve Pascoe made 42 of them, before a pivotal last wicket stand of 70 between John McCartin and Stan Davis that would go down in folklore. Davis then claimed 5/33 to rout the opposition for 128, and give the club a 62 run first innings lead midway through the 3rd and final day. Warrandyte looked to then bat out the day and claim a comfortable win, but after collapsing to be all out for 96, Wantirna South had 25 overs to score 159 runs in fading light. Fielding was almost impossible as dark clouds closed in on the ground and infielders were forced to scream out the direction of the ball to outfielders unable to pick up its flight. Davis refused to appeal against the light, preferring to play the game out to a finish, and when the opposition finished on 8/131, Warrandyte prevailed by 28 runs, claiming their first ever top grade premiership. Back row (L-R) Darren Peters, Colin Dorning (12th man), Wayne Amiguet, Graeme Jacobs, Fred Jungwirth, Bruce Kline, Graeme Lloyd Front row (L-R) John Chapman, Steve Pascoe, John Salter, Robert White, Ann Pascoe (scorer), Marty McCarthy After failing to reach the finals in their title defense, John Salter was recruited from district cricket as captain/coach in 1983/84. In one of the great batting line ups of all time, he scored a record 690 runs, while Graeme Jacobs, Robert White and Wayne Amiguet all scored 400 plus runs. Graeme Lloyd was a one-man wrecking machine, taking a further 71 wickets, the most ever since 1922/23. Finishing on top the ladder at the end of the season, they cruised to the final where they defeated East Ringwood and claimed their second premiership in the top grade. Robert White had an excellent all-round game, scoring 84 out of the 304 team score, then took 5/60 with the ball, as East Ringwood fell 60 runs short. The next season they finished 2nd on the back of Salter's record breaking 955 run season, and set up a second successive grand final when they amassed 5/316 in the semi final. But East Ringwood caused a huge upset and passed the score 8 wickets down. The loss brought the season to a premature close, and as it turned out, also ended the most successful era in the club's history. In just six seasons, 13 premierships were won. 7 senior, including 3 for the first eleven, and 6 in the juniors. ===Rebuilding phase (1986 - 1994)=== In 1985/86 the club lost their equivalent of Chappell, Lillee and Marsh, with Salter, Lloyd and Kline all departing the club. Despite record playing numbers, peaking with 15 teams in 1986/87, and the introduction of the veterans XI in 1988/89, the next few seasons saw the 1st XI languish in the bottom half of the ladder, but remained in Chandler Shield. Following a year where the highest ranked senior side was the 8th placed reserve side, John Sharman was recruited to the club as captain/coach in 1990/91. His work ethic on the training field rubbed off on the field, as the top 3 teams all made finals. Sharman also brought with him an array of talent, including determined opening batsman Andrew Hood, Campbell Horlock and all-rounder Harry Drysdale. And with the emergence of Warrandyte juniors Tony Sturesteps, Gerald Walshe and David Mooney, the 1st XI were becoming competitive again, returning to the finals in 1992/93. They lost the semi final to Ainslie Park, which would start one of the great RDCA rivalries. The next season, local fruit shop owner and former Australian test cricket Rodney Hogg was talked into rolling the arm over again. Despite being 42 years old at the time, was still extremely quick when in the mood, and terrorised many a batsman in his 2 seasons at Warrandyte. After thrashing Wonga Park in the semi, they met Ainslie Park in the 1993/94 Chandler Shield Grand Final, which would twist and turn into the greatest RDCA final of all time. Scheduled for 3 days and 240 overs, Warrandyte batted first, as John Sharman's 64 runs pushed the score to a meagre total of 175 from 90 overs. With a day and a half day remaining, there was plenty of time, and when Ainslie Park got within 35 runs with 7 wickets in hand, they had one hand their first Chandler Shield. Then Hogg produced a tremendous spell of bowling, and sparked a collapse of 6/31 to end day 2 with the game well and truly in the balance. The final day began with Warrandyte needing 1 wicket, and Ainslie 5 runs for victory. The first over was a maiden bowled by Sturesteps, then Hogg sent a yorker into the stumps, and Warrandyte into delirium. Hogg ended up with 7/33, all that was required was to bat out the remainder of the day to claim victory. But as only Warrandyte can, a shaky batting display opened the door, and the team were precariously at 7/77. A solid partnership recovered the damage to get to 7/113 with just 22 overs left in the match, but again the game changed, as the final 3 wickets fell in 3 overs. So Ainslie required 117 runs from 19 overs to reverse the result, and raced to 0/24 after the first 2. Then another twist, 2 quick wickets to Hogg and then a run out made it 3/34. The score reached 3/49 with 11 overs to play, when Hogg struck a batsman on the head with a bouncer, and an ambulance was required on the ground. Light was fading during the delay, and the umpires decided play couldn't recommence, so once again Warrandyte assumed the victory. But then more controversy, as RDCA officials announced play would continue on an unprecedented 4th day. So the players returned to the East Ringwood oval, and with a huge crowd in attendance, fortunes ebbed and flowed again until 7 runs were required from the final over with 5 wickets in hand. A bye from a disputed run out, a boundary, and finally a leg bye saw Ainslie Park reach the total, winning outright with 3 balls remaining of the 240th and last over. Warrandyte left to ponder how the lost a game they had already won. ===Survival and relegation (1995 - 2000)=== Back row (L-R) Greg Tregear, Gerald Walshe, Fred Jungwirth, John Chapman, Graeme Jacobs, Bruce Kline, Alan Woolcock Front row (L-R) John Sharman, Graeme Lloyd, Steve Pascoe, Robert White Hogg took another 35 wickets the following season, but the firsts struggled for runs after the departures of Sharman and his recruits. They failed to reach the finals, and spent the rest of the decade regularly staving off relegation. Three highlights stand out in the 90s. Two 1st XI records were broken when Chris Snaidero took all 10 wickets in an innings in February 1996, and David Mooney scored 184 not out in January 1997. While the 4th XI were the only Warrandyte team to win 3 premierships in a row. Season 1996/97 was a tough one both on and off the field. Most teams languished around the bottom of the ladder, and the 5th XI couldn't field a side after Christmas. Diminishing player numbers also had a critical effect on finances, and the club were forced to float the idea of merging with South Warrandyte to survive. However this option was voted against, and both clubs continued and prospered in the coming seasons. One positive to come out of this period was the council refurbishing the practice net area after the 1997/98 season. The start of the 21st century presented an opportunity to showcase the history with the announcement of the team of the century. The nomination criteria was a minimum of 50 games, 1,000 runs or 100 wickets, and was voted on by all living life members. The team known as Club 12 was Allan Chapman (C), John Sharman (V/C), John Chapman, Graeme Jacobs, Fred Jungwirth, Bruce Kline (w/k), Graeme Lloyd, Steve Pascoe, Greg Tregear, Gerald Walshe, Robert White, Alan Woolcock. All team members aside from Allan Chapman, who died in 1981, were honoured at a function on 25 November 2000. The 3 seasons from 1998/99 to 2000/01 were also particularly taxing, with none of the 4 senior grades reaching higher than 9th on the ladder. This caused a tremendous strain on morale, causing many players to lose interest, and the 4th XI were often playing short and sometimes forfeiting altogether. An RDCA condition at the time was for a club to remain in the top grade of Chandler Shield, it must field a minimum of 4 sides. As Warrandyte couldn't guarantee that, it was decided in a heated committee meeting to relegate itself. As it turned out before the season started, the RDCA removed that rule, meaning Warrandyte could have remained. ===Looking back and moving forward (2001 - present)=== 16 August 2001 saw the launch of the Warrandyte Cricket Club website. Created by Steve Goddard, it showcased the rich statistical history of the club, and is still one of the most extensive local sporting websites in the country. The club entered the 2nd tier Wilkins Cup in 2001/02, and found the format of the mixed one and two day structure unpredictable. The 1st XI would often find themselves playing finals one year, and fighting relegation the next. Some excellent work was being done with the juniors, thanks largely to the introduction of a father/son 4th XI run mainly by Lee Dehmel and Graham Rees. Season 2002/03 saw the introduction of the Steve Pascoe Medal, which became an annual award given to the highest vote polling player at the club, selected by the players on a 3-2-1 basis each game. The first season was low key, with only an overall medal presented to Brendan Baker. A vote count and separate grade medals were introduced the following year, which are named after former greats of that grade: Gerald Walshe, Brett Kline, Nathan Croft, Jim Gathercole and Bob Leguier (1st XI to 5th XI). The votes count, which is now combined with the club's Presentation Night, has developed from humble beginnings into the biggest event on the calendar. Season 2003/04 saw 5-time 1st XI Club Champion Adam White, son of Life Member Robert, win his first of two association best and fairest medals. White has become one of the club's most decorated players ever, with a multitude of 1st XI awards including 7 batting, 1 bowling and 2 Gerald Walshe Medals, as well as 2 Steve Pascoe Medals. The club celebrated its 150th birthday with a dinner held on 22 January 2005 at it was an outstanding success. Then on Sunday 13 February 2005, the club continued the celebrations with a Twenty20 against an Invitational XI that included a mix of District cricketers, AFL footballers identities including Sam Mitchell and Gerard Whateley, along with entertainers Wilbur Wilde and Ernie Dingo as MC. Up until 2007, statistics were collated from club scorebooks dated back to 1952. But after extensive research conducted by Steve Goddard at the State Library of Victoria, match scores and articles were obtained from various newspapers dating back to when the club starting competitively in 1905 and beyond. Previously all 1st XI players were given a number in order of their debut, and with over 800 extra match results discovered, 164 more players were added to the list. John Till is credited as Warrandyte 1st XI player No.1, while the most recent is Luke Warren No.431. A Heritage Night club function was held on 20 January 2007, where past and present players were honoured with their new number. It was also the 25th anniversary of the club's first premiership in the top grade, and the players reunited. The function followed a Past Players Day, when the newly created Steve Pascoe Cup was fought out between rivals Warrandyte and Norwood, where Pascoe is a life member at both clubs. Pascoe also umpired the game, and awarded the Chris Snaidero Medal to the man of the match. Snaidero is another legend of both cricket clubs. Norwood were victors on this occasion, and the cup will be up for grabs whenever the teams play. Overall the decade was extremely successful, and the winning culture improved player numbers that was previously eroded. From 2003/04 to 2010/11, 30 out of a possible 38 senior teams participated in finals, claiming 7 premierships, as well as 3 junior and 1 veterans flags. But unfortunately, none for the 1st XI in 3 attempts, who are still working and striving towards the ultimate success, and a return to the top grade. ==Premierships== {  fcfdff; font-size:95%;\\" - !TeamSeasonCompetitionGradeMatch Details -  style=\\"background: Yellow;

The divided socialists offered Teodoro Petkoff and José Vicente Rangel. Petkoff had broken with the Communist Party and, with the veteran leader Pompeyo Marquez, had founded in 1971 the Movement for Socialism (MAS in Spanish), which was more or less inspired by the Prague Spring, when Czech communists tried to liberalize their country in 1968.Petkoff, Teodoro, Checoeslovaquia: el socialismo como problema, 1969 MAS was still Marxist but edging to left of center. Rangel was the son of a general during the Gómez autocracy, but he entered politics in 1958 as a moderate leftist. Rangel denounced the abuses of the adeco governments of Betancourt and Leoni—he accused them of allowing the secret police and the army to torture detainees—and he was the MAS presidential candidate in 1973 and 1978, both times doing badly. Teodoro was particularly disliked by adeco pardos. Teodoro was always trying to displace Rangel as his party's choice and finally, in 1983, the two men had a chance to test each other's popularity. Much of the campaign was taken up by an \\"underground\\" debate about Lusinchi's mistress, Blanca Ibañez, and adecos insisted that his legal wife had simply \\"to bite the bullet\\". When the results were in, bipolarity worked and the adecos proved that they still had the pardos on their side by garnering 56% of the vote, the highest margin ever in a Venezuelan election. Caldera was down, but, as we shall see, definitely not out. But there were two novelties in the results: although Petkoff got more votes than Rangel, together they got 7% of the vote, which the left had never before achieved, although it is questionable whether Teodoro at that point was in any way the radical he had been before. Another result was that abstentions were 12% and this was significant because, as we saw, voting was compulsory in Venezuela and by and large Venezuelans had been very dutiful in this respect, and now they showed that not voting was catching on. ==Presidency== Corruption had always been an issue in Venezuela, but under Lusinchi it became the main issue, and most Venezuelans considered that corruption, and not sheer incompetence, was the root of all of society's ills. Lusinchi had divorced his wife and married Blanca Ibañez, who was considered very influential behind the scene and was blamed for abuse of power and nepotism. The Venezuelan economy stagnated, and the country at the end of Lusinchi's regime was reportedly bankrupt. It would be reasonable to surmise that this should have been the end of bipolarity in the next elections, but it would be wrong. In the 1988 elections, the two ruling parties got a total of 93% of the vote. Petkoff fared very badly, but abstentions went up to 18%. The winner was none other than Carlos Andrés Pérez, for his second term. (In the Venezuelan constitution you could be re- elected as many times as you wanted as long as it wasn’t in successive elections.) The question was: How could a country whose descent into insolvency began with Pérez, who had botched so badly his first term, when corruption flourished as never before, have re-elected him with a majority that was barely less than the one Lusinchi got? This enigma has various explanations. That pardos were still adecos is an obvious one. The opposition to bipolarity did not have a leader is another. But especially, Venezuelans of all hues simply remembered that during Pérez's first term there had been a lot of money in circulation, things over-all had not been so dismal, and somehow they figured that Pérez could perform the miracle of making Venezuela \\"prosperous\\" again. == Lusinchi's cabinet (1984-1989) == { cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"4\\" style=\\"margin:1px; border:1px solid Black; float:left\\" -

He was the member of the National Assembly of Quebec for the riding of Sainte-Marie—Saint-Jacques between 2012 and 2014. ==Early life and activism== Breton was born in Montreal and studied political science at the University of Montreal and the University of Quebec at Montreal.Canada Votes: 2008: Results, Ridings and Candidates: Jeanne-Le Ber, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, accessed 21 May 2012. He was a principal organizer of a November 2001 march in Montreal against Canada's military intervention in Afghanistan. During the march, he was quoted as saying, \\"We held this demonstration because we are against a military solution to settle the conflict and the fight against terrorism. We are against terrorism, but war is not the solution.\\"Paul Cherry, \\"Anti-war message on march: Downtown demo denounces violence, feds' terrorism bill,\\" Montreal Gazette, 18 November 2001, A3. Breton subsequently founded Québec-Vert-Kyoto (later known as QuébecKyoto), which advocated in favour of the Kyoto Accord on climate change. In 2004, he led an ultimately successful protest against Hydro-Quebec's plans to launch the Suroit natural gas power project near Beauharnois.Gary Francoeur, \\"Suroit foes plan protest demo: Power project hearings wrap up,\\" Montreal Gazette, 21 May 2004, A9; Gary Francoeur, \\"Protesters march against natural-gas-powered plant,\\" Montreal Gazette, 30 May 2004, A2; Catherine Solyom, \\"'Surprised it took so long': Opponents 'very happy',\\" Montreal Gazette, 18 November 2004, A4. The following year, he called for the Montreal Transit Corporation to invest in suburban commuter trains rather than building a new bridge between Laval and Montreal.Monique Beaudin, \\"Transit holds its own, but car use still on rise,\\" Montreal Gazette, 19 January 2005, A8. In June 2007, Breton called on Canadian environment minister John Baird to resign over the Stephen Harper government's handling of the Kyoto Accord. Breton described Baird as \\"neither competent nor willing to carry in a serious, non- partisan manner, the heavy burden of the environment portfolio.\\"\\"Baird should resign over Tory government's Kyoto approach: Quebec coalition,\\" Canadian Press, 5 June 2007. Breton spoke against Quebec's plans for shale gas exploration in 2010.\\"D'autres voix disent que l'audience du BAPE sur le schiste est vouée à l'échec,\\" La Presse Canadienne -- Le Fil Radio, 10 September 2010. On November 29, 2012, Daniel Breton resigned from his post as environment minister less than two months after taking office. He was an unsuccessful candidate during the 2018 election. ==Political activism== Breton helped re-launch the dormant Green Party of Quebec for the 2003 Quebec general election and was the party's candidate in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. He finished sixth against Parti Québécois incumbent Louise Harel. Breton also worked for the Green Party of Canada. He supported the sovereigntist option in the 1995 Quebec referendum on sovereignty and signed a joint statement in favour of Quebec independence in 2007.\\"Former Green Party organizer joins federal NDP,\\" Postmedia News, 8 February 2008, p. 1. In 2008, Breton left the Green Party to join the Canadian New Democratic Party (NDP). In joining the NDP, he was quoted as saying, \\"what is at stake in 2008 is not the sovereignty of Quebec but the sovereignty of Canada. We are in the process of losing control over our natural resources, over our economy, of our big businesses and our political sovereignty.\\"\\"Green Party organizer to run for NDP,\\" Montreal Gazette, 9 February 2008, A8. He ran as a star candidate for the party in the 2008 federal election and finished third in Jeanne-Le Ber.\\"Montreal supremacy up for grabs; 18 precious seats,\\" Montreal Gazette, 15 October 2008, B3. He was not a candidate in the 2011 federal election, in which the NDP made a historic breakthrough to become the dominant federal party in Quebec. In 2012, Breton joined the Parti Québécois and ran successfully for the party in the 2012 election, retaining the riding of Sainte-Marie–Saint-Jacques for the PQ. He was the minister of Sustainable Development, Environment, Wildlife and Parks from September 19 to November 29, 2012Daniel Breton, on the website of the National Assembly in the government of Pauline Marois.

All the wives of the participating NASCAR drivers received a special racing pass that allowed them to access all aspects of racing life except for the pits where the drivers' crew did their actual work. ==Background== Layout of Darlington Raceway, the track where the race was held. Darlington Raceway, nicknamed by many NASCAR fans and drivers as \\"The Lady in Black\\" or \\"The Track Too Tough to Tame\\" and advertised as a \\"NASCAR Tradition\\", is a race track built for NASCAR racing located near Darlington, South Carolina. It is of a unique, somewhat egg-shaped design, an oval with the ends of very different configurations, a condition which supposedly arose from the proximity of one end of the track to a minnow pond the owner refused to relocate. This situation makes it very challenging for the crews to set up their cars' handling in a way that will be effective at both ends. The track is a four-turn oval. The track's first two turns are banked at twenty-five degrees, while the final two turns are banked two degrees lower at twenty-three degrees. The front stretch (the location of the finish line) and the back stretch is banked at six degrees. Darlington Raceway can seat up to 60,000 people. ==Summary== Lasting almost four hours, this final \\"traditional\\" Southern 500 racing event would feature Bill Elliott (employed at that time by Mr. Harry Melling of Melling Racing) defeating Rusty Wallace (employed by Raymond Beadle Blue Max Racing racing team during this era) by 0.24 seconds; the average speed of the race was .1988 Southern 500 racing information at Racing Reference Four drivers would fail to qualify for this race; which had ten cautions for a whopping 49 laps. 74000 people would attend the race to see 367 laps of racing action; last-place finisher Harry Gant would only finish 50 of them due to engine difficulties. Twenty-four different changes would be made for the first-place position of the race. The pole winner was also the winner of the race; qualifying with speeds up to . Both Richard Petty and his son Kyle would compete in this race. Notable drivers at the race also included Darrell Waltrip, Terry Labonte, and Alan Kulwicki. Despite being the 21st round of the 1988 NASCAR Winston Cup Series, this was the first Cup race in 1988 to have any driver get the pole, lead the most laps and win. Rusty Wallace faired fairly well at this race; he just could never win the race because Bill Elliott was already ahead for at least four lengths car lengths in turns 3 and 4. Just like in 1985, Elliott dominates and wins the Southern 500 and leaves there leading the points. Unlike 1985, the Melling team has a strong, consistent run to the end of the season to claim the Winston Cup title for 1988. Two different drivers would be involved in accidents; Derrike Cope on lap 203 and Ken Ragan on lap 308.1988 Southern 500 racing information at Driver Averages A stock car carrying the Ford manufacturer won the race while Chevrolet was the official manufacturer of the last-place finisher. The total purse of the race was $431,345 ($ when adjusted for inflation); with the winner taking $75,800 of the purse ($ when adjusted for inflation).1988 Southern 500 at Fantasy Racing Cheat Sheet From the following year to the end of the autumn Southern 500 races in 2004, a sponsor's name would be added to the overall race name; reducing the traditionalism surrounding the early \\"Southern 500\\" races. ==Timeline== Section reference: * Start: Bill Elliott was ahead of the other drivers as the green flag was waved. * Lap 41: NASCAR officials gave out a competition caution, caution ended on lap 44. * Lap 50: Harry Gant had to leave the race because his vehicle's engine stopped working properly. * Lap 54: Caution due to Morgan Shepherd's engine failure, caution ended on lap 60. * Lap 82: Rick Wilson's vehicle had engine problems and had to leave the race. * Lap 113: Jimmy Horton had to leave the race due to engine failure. * Lap 130: Caution due to Brett Bodine causing terminal damage to his vehicle, caution ended on lap 132. * Lap 135: Randy Baker had to leave the race due to a problematic engine. * Lap 167: Caution due to Rick Mast causing terminal damage to his vehicle on turn 1, caution ended on lap 170. * Lap 206: Caution due to Derrike Cope causing terminal damage to his vehicle on turn 4, caution ended on lap 208. * Lap 236: Caution due to Richard Petty causing terminal damage to his vehicle on turn 2, caution ended on lap 239. * Lap 239: Dale Jarrett had to the leave the race due to engine difficulties. * Lap 257: Caution due to Ken Bouchard spinning out on the front stretch, caution ended on lap 260. * Lap 302: Caution due to H.B.

Pevensey starred in the role as the fictional PS Philadelphia in the Australian television mini- series All the Rivers Run, made in Echuca in 1982–1983. The PS Emmylou, also based at Echuca, starred as the PS Providence in the series. ==History== PS Pevensey is named after a sheep property on the Murrumbidgee River called Pevensey Station. The paddle steamer was built at the Moama slipway in 1911 by Permewan Wright & Co. Ltd. Pevensey collected bales of wool from sheep stations and brought them to the Echuca wharf. From the wharf, it was loaded onto trains and taken to Melbourne for export overseas. Pevensey could carry 815 bales of wool and a total of 2000 bales when barges were towed along behind. Pevensey’s barge was called Ada. After the river trade ended, Pevensey was tied up at Mildura. It later was towed to Echuca to be restored in 1973. ==Particulars== PS Pevensey is powered by its original steam engine, built by Marshall, Sons & Co. of England.

It is an unstable compound as copper(I) compounds are generally unstable and is more commonly found in the CuSO4 state. It is white in color at room temperature and is water-soluble. Due to the low-stability of the compound there are currently not many applications to date. == Synthesis == Anhydrous Cu2SO4, can be synthesized at approximately around 75% purity by the action of dimethyl sulfate on Cu2O following the formula: :Cu2O + (CH3O)2SO2 -> Cu2SO4 + (CH3)2O The material is fairly stable in dry air at room temperature but decomposes rapidly in presence of moisture or on heating. Due to its instability the material starts to decompose when heated or if water is present to CuSO4 and follows the formula: :Cu2SO4 ->[\\\\ce{H2O}] Cu + CuSO4 Around temperatures of 300 °C it is not likely for any Cu2SO4 to be present as the structure is just not stable enough. It can also be prepared by reducing copper(II) sulfate solution with a reducing agent like solution sodium bisulfite or sodium thiosulfate to reduce Cu2+ to Cu+. This is visibly noticeable as the blue CuSO4 will begin to turn colorless when the cuprous ion is formed. == Structure == Cu2SO4 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Fddd with cubic closest pack cell unit properties a = 474.8, b = 1396, and c = 1086 pm, Z = 8, Dx = 4.12 g cm−3. The structure is formed by the tendency of Cu(I) to form two collinear sp bonds to oxygen atoms which result in short O-Cu-O groups with the O-Cu bond length being approximately 196vpm. Due to the bonding properties of the Cu(I) metal the structure is built of layers of composition Cu2SO4. Due to the loss of only one electron and the bonding properties of copper(I) the structure is built up from four oxygen atoms of each sulfate group bonding to four other sulfate groups of the same layer via symmetrical O-Cu-O bridging. Due to its unstable nature it is difficult to obtain an accurate 3D structure, but was first successfully done in 1987 by Berthold, Born, and Wartchow. == Applications == No current common uses due to stability issues. However, its more common copper(II) sulfate form has various current uses from production of fungicides and insecticides, growth stimulation in agriculture, soil sterilization, disinfection, preservatives, antiseptics, pharmaceuticals, disease prevention, mold protection, gas purification and coloring, textiles, public health and medicine, agriculture, and chemistry. == References == Category:Copper(I) compounds Category:Sulfates ","title":"Copper(I) sulfate"},{"id":"35897596","text":"Island Generating Station (also known as Island Cogeneration Ltd.) is a natural gas-fired station owned by Capital Power Corporation, in Campbell River, British Columbia, Canada.

Brown (February 6, 1945 – May 5, 2012) was a New York City based visual artist originally from Chicago. His style ranges from abstract expressionism to figurative. His art work was influenced by historical, religious, narrative and urban themes. He is noted for his extensive portrait series of jazz and blues musicians. His work is part of the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum and National Portrait Gallery, as well as the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art in Kansas City, Mo. In 1988, Brown had the first solo exhibition by a Western artist at the Museum of the Chinese Revolution (now the National Museum of China) in Tienanmen Square in Beijing, China. ==Early life== Frederick James Brown was born in Greensboro, Georgia on February 6, 1945. His mother was Geneva Brown and his father was Andrew Bentley. He was raised near the steel mills on Chicago's Southside. Brown was exposed to the blues through musicians in the neighborhood such as Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Memphis Slim. Brown attended Chicago Vocational High School. He then attended Southern Illinois University Carbondale, (SIU) graduating in 1968 with a degree in Art. ==Career== In 1970, Brown moved from Chicago to New York City's SoHo neighborhood which at the time was home to many artists, musicians, writers and dancers. There he collaborated on multi-media projects with other artists including jazz musicians Ornette Coleman and Anthony Braxton, video photographer Anthony Ramos, and other painters like Grégoire Müller, Frank Bowling and Daniel Johnson. In addition to collaborative paintings, Brown contributed to performing arts productions like Be Aware, Stolen Moments and Portrait of a Painter. Anthony Braxton composed and performed the music and Anthony Ramos created the videos for the latter two projects. Brown's loft at 120 Wooster Street became a gathering place in SoHo during this period.357x357px Brown exhibited with Marlborough Fine Art in New York from 1983 through 1990. During this time, he focused much of his work on creating portraits of jazz and blues musicians. This series contains over 350 pieces, including popular artists such as Ornette Coleman, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, and Lionel Hampton in addition to less well-known jazz and blues artists. Brown taught art at the Central College of Fine Arts in Beijing in 1985 and 1987. In June 1988, Brown had a retrospective exhibition of 100 art works at the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, becoming one of the earliest Western artists to exhibit in China (Robert Rauschenberg preceded him with ROCI CHINA at the National Art Museum of China in 1985). Brown created a five- panel painting, The Life of Christ Altarpiece, for the Museum of Contemporary Religious Art, St. Louis University, in 1992. The three central panels represent the Baptism, Descent From the Cross, and Resurrection of Christ, with two side panels of the Madonna and Child and the Descent into Hell. In 1993, Brown completed The Assumption of Mary at Xavier University of Louisiana. The painting is three stories tall and is on a single canvas. Crosby Kemper commissioned Brown to do a site specific project for the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art in Kansas City, which was under construction. In 1994, Brown's personal interpretation of The History of Art, a series of 110 paintings chronicling the progression of art through human history was installed in the museum's Café Sebastienne (named after Brown's daughter, Sebastienne). From 2002 to 2003, Brown had a retrospective exhibition titled Frederick J. Brown: Portraits in Jazz, Blues, and Other Icons. The exhibition traveled from the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art and the American Jazz Museum in Kansas City to the New Orleans Museum of Art and the Studio Museum of Harlem. In September 2008 Brown organized a symposium of artists, musicians, dancers and poets at Cornell University on the Creative Movement of the 1970s.

Colloquially known as the Short Course (), it became the most widely disseminated book during the time (until 1952) that Joseph Stalin served as the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the AUCP (B) and one of the most important works elucidating Marxism–Leninism. == Overview == The book was commissioned by Stalin in 1935.Rappaport, Helen (1999). Joseph Stalin: A Biographical Companion. ABC-CLIO. . p. 130. Regarding the motives for compiling it, Robert Service quoted a Bolshevik official who said there was a need for a book which \\"instead of the Bible\\" would \\"give a rigorous answer [...] [t]o the many important questions\\". At the time, the party was concerned with the abundance of publications about the AUCP (B)'s history and sought to have a single, simple and authoritative book on the subject. The book was written by a team of historians and party members, with the principal authors being Vilhelm Knorin, Pyotr Pospelov and Yemelyan Yaroslavsky. Stalin wrote the chapter about dialectical materialism. In 1937, a draft of the Short Course was submitted to Stalin, who in turn requested several revisions to the text, including more historical background. On 16 April, the Politburo decreed that Knoriņ, Pospelov and Yaroslavsky would be relieved from all their other party obligations for a period of four months in order to complete the Short Course.Torchinov, Valeri ; Leontiuk, Alexei (2000). Vokrug Stalina: Istoriko- Biograficheskii Spravochnik. Filologicheskii Fakultet Sankt-Peterburgskogo Universitet. . p. 255. Between 8 September and 17 September 1938, Pospelov, Yaroslavsky, Vyacheslav Molotov and Andrei Zhdanov (Knorin was arrested in the Great Purge and executed on 29 July 1938) met daily with Stalin in his office at the Kremlin to make the last edits to the manuscript. The first chapter appeared in Pravda on 9 September 1938 and the rest of the text was published in serial form, the last chapter on 19 September. On that day, the Politburo decided to have a first edition of six million copies, to be sold at a particularly low price—three rubles a copy, equivalent to the price of a liter and half of milk at the time.Boterbloem, Kees (2004). Life and Times of Andrei Zhdanov, 1896-1948. McGill-Queen's Press. . p. 176. On 1 October, the book was released.Volkogonov, Dmitri (1989). Triumf i tragediia : politicheskii portret I.V. Stalina. Novosti. OCLC 20665799. p. 147. On 14 November, the Central Committee issued a resolution On Conduct of Party Propaganda in Connection with the Publication of the Short Course, stating it \\"ends all arbitrariness and confusion in the presentation of Party history\\" and turning the book into mandatory reading in the curriculum of all university students and attendants of party schools.Banerji, Arup (2008). Writing History in the Soviet Union: Making the Past Work. Berghahn Books. . pp. 143-144. Until Stalin's death in March 1953, the Short Course was reprinted 301 times and had 42,816,000 copies issued in Russian alone. In addition, it was translated to 66 other languages.Bernstein, Thomas P.; Hua-Yu, Li (2010). China Learns from the Soviet Union, 1949-Present. Rowman & Littlefield. . p. 113. In Hungary, 530,000 copies were printed between 1948 and 1950.Botos, János (1988). Magyar hétköznapok : Rákosi Mátyás két emigrációja között, 1945-1956. Minerva. . p. 304. In Czechoslovakia, over 652,000 copies were printed from 1950 to 1954.Elman Zareco, Kimberly (2011). Manufacturing a Socialist Modernity: Housing in Czechoslovakia, 1945-1960. University of Pittsburgh Press. . p. 309. It was the most widely disseminated work in Stalin's time and no communist publication broke its record until Quotations from Chairman Mao.Eley, Geoff (2002). Forging Democracy: The History of the Left in Europe, 1850-2000. Oxford University Press. . p. 256. In 1956, Nikita Khrushchev formally repudiated the Short Course in his \\"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\\" speech. A new authoritative history of the party written by a team headed by Boris Ponomarev was published in 1962 under the name The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.Banerji. p. 148. == Changes in the text == The version of the history of the party described in the first edition of 1938 was significantly changed to match Stalin's preferences and it changed during subsequent reprints, following the changes in party leadership. Veteran Bolshevik leaders like Nikolai Bukharin, Lev Kamenev, Alexei Rykov, Leon Trotsky and Grigory Zinovyev, who conflicted with Stalin and were killed in the 1930s were described as \\"mensheviks\\" who from the very beginning \\"opposed Lenin and the Bolshevik party\\". The names of Filipp Goloshchyokin and Nikolai Yezhov, initially described as \\"experienced leaders engaged in enlightening the Red Army\\" in 1938, were deleted from the book after both were arrested in 1939. == Influence in China == Although the Short Course was eventually rejected by the Soviet leadership during the Khrushchev Thaw, its formulations, especially the idea that class struggle not only continued, but intensified as the state moved towards socialism, continued to be of fundamental importance in China, where Mao Zedong repeatedly attacked his opponents in the Communist Party of China as \\"capitalist roaders\\" and agents of bourgeois, counter-revolutionary and Kuomintang conspiracies.Walder, Andrew G. (2015), China under Mao: A revolution derailed. Harvard University Press. . pp 25-26. Mao felt that the Short Course best combined the teachings of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin as well as being a blue print to applying communist ideals in the real world. China was continuing to grow into a Marxist–Leninist state and that fully happened in 1949, making almost one third of the population of the world under the rule of Marxism–Leninism. == References  External links == * The Short Course (in English, 1938 International Publishers edition) * The Short Course (in English, 1951 Soviet edition) * The History of the CPSU (in Russian) Category:1938 non-fiction books Category:Communist Party of the Soviet Union Category:History books about the Soviet Union Category:History textbooks Category:Soviet internal politics Category:Soviet propaganda books Category:Works by Joseph Stalin ","title":"History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)"},{"id":"35897680","text":"Carmelo Antonio Lauría Lesseur (24 August 1936 - 29 November 2010 Globovision, 30 November 2010, Hoy se realizará ceremonia fúnebre del dirigente político Carmelo Lauría RAFAEL DÍAZ CASANOVA, El Universal, 3 December 2010, Carmelo que está en el cielo) was a Venezuelan businessman, lawyer and politician.

He is the son of Benito Arévalo Barbarán and María Valera Teco. At age seven, he was matriculated into a Catholic mission school near Puerto Inca, a village on the bank of the Pachitea River. This was a boarding school, and Guillermo lived there until he was 18. When this phase of his education was complete, his parents pressed him to go to Brazil to study nursing. However, he cut his nursing studies short and returned to Yarinacocha, where he accepted a position as a nurse at the Hospital Amazónico. ===From the hospital to the rainforest=== His experience at the hospital was formative. He worked with patients who were recovering from surgery; some of them told him that the hospital's treatments didn't make them feel better, even if examinations and test results indicated improvement. Others worried that Western medicine couldn't help them if their illness was a result of witchcraft (brujería). Through observations and conversations with patients and hospital staff—especially a Swedish doctor named Anders Hansson—he concluded that Western medicine did not meet all the needs of the indigenous population. But the limits to the hospital's efficacy were not just a matter of cultural difference: The indigenous population was contending with serious health problems and constrained medical resources. Arévalo looked to Shipibo traditional medicine as an alternative, researching phytotherapy and local plant lore. By age 22 he was learning about the Amazonian shamanic discipline of vegetalismo, and eventually saw a need to undergo the customary training rites. His father was a vegetalista, but Arévalo traveled downriver to the village of Pahoyan to be mentored by Manuel Mahua (1930–2008). He was about age 24 when he resigned from the hospital and committed himself to three months of isolation and self-deprivation in the forest—a shamanic practice known as dieta. By age 26, he was practicing vegetalismo. ==AMETRA== In 1982, Arévalo and Anders Hansson co-founded a local organization called Aplicación de Medicina Tradicional (AMETRA), which (with Swedish funding) sought to revive the traditional medicine practices of Shipibo-Conibo people, and to look for ways to incorporate them into a health system for indigenous communities. Over the next few years, AMETRA published several papers, and Arévalo and Hansson personally authored or contributed to some of these.Hansson, A.; Arévalo, G. (1985). \\"Algunos aspectos de medicina tradicional en Ucayali.\\" Proyecto AMETRA. Lima: Instituto Indigenista Peruano. Serie Amazonía: Shipibo-Conibo No. 2 The practicality of an integrative medicine approach attracted the attention of two regional federations of indigenous peoples: FECONAU (Federacíon de Comunidades Nativas del Ucayali y Afluentes) and FENAMAD (Federación Nativa del Río Madre de Dios y Afluentes), who sought to apply AMETRA's ideas to a revised health system in their own regions. As AMETRA's concept began to coalesce into possible solutions, funding flowed in from the World Wide Fund for Nature, the Rainforest Alliance, Pronaturaleza, and various member organizations of Friends of the Earth. Arévalo left AMETRA in 1990 over contrasting views within the organization. ==Later advocacy and entrepreneurship== After leaving AMETRA, Arévalo began treating people at his home in Yarinacocha, catering exclusively to a mestizo clientele. In 1994, through his affiliation with the indigenous development organization AIDESEP, he published a book: Medicinal Plants and Their Benefit to Shipibo-Conibo Health (). In May 1999, the UN's World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) met with Arévalo to discuss his perspective on the \\"intellectual property needs and expectations\\" of Amazonian peoples. Arévalo expressed the view that traditional medicine is of pivotal importance to Amazonian cultures, and that indigenous communities must be able to negotiate access to it in order to prevent exploitation and environmental harm. Arévalo was one of several people that WIPO representatives spoke with during a fact-finding mission to Peru and Bolivia. Arévalo spoke in his capacity as president of IDIMA, the Instituto de Difusion e Investigacion de la Medicina Amazonica. In 2004 Arévalo founded a woodland healing-retreat near the city of Iquitos. He co-managed the center with his wife, Sonia Chuquimbalqui, and marketed it to health tourists. The center was called Espíritu de Anaconda (\\"Anaconda Spirit\\") until they renamed it to Anaconda Cosmica (\\"Cosmic Anaconda\\") in 2011. For a time, Arévalo also operated a second lodge, Baris Betsa. Arévalo's son James began operating a retreat lodge called Luz Cosmica in 2010. James learned vegetalismo from his grandfather, Benito; he began studying under Guillermo in 2006. Another of Arévalo's students, Ricardo Amaringo, opened a lodge called Nihue Rao (aka Ronin Saini) in 2011, in partnership with American family medicine practitioner Joe Tafur and Canadian artist Cvita Mamic. A central fixture at the retreat lodges is the administration of ayahuasca, a psychedelic tisane used and revered by ethnic groups throughout the Amazon Basin. In an interview with journalist Roger Rumrrill in 2005, Arévalo lamented the state of drug tourism in Peru. ==Recorded media== Arévalo was filmed for the ayahuasca documentary films D'autres mondes (2004) and Vine of the Soul: Encounters with Ayahuasca (2010). Jan Kounen, director of D'autres mondes, met Arévalo in the Peruvian Amazon while conducting research for his film Blueberry (2004). Kounen gave Arévalo a minor role in Blueberry, and participated in ayahuasca ceremonies with him over the course of a year. Two songs sung by Arévalo (credited to his Shipibo name, Kestenbetsa) appear on the Blueberry soundtrack. When another interviewer asked Arévalo what impact his appearances in Kounen's films have had, Arévalo said: \\"It meant that more and more people became aware of ayahuasca shamanism, and that's good. Professionally it's meant that more and more people are interested in Guillermo, and they want to know me.\\" Kounen had previously co-produced an album of eight songs sung by Arévalo (a cappella) in the Shipibo language. The album, Songs from Questembetsa: Shipibo Shaman of Peru, was released on CD in 2000. The other co-producers were French musicians Jean-Jacques Hertz and François Roy, who also composed Blueberrys score. ==See also== * Pablo Amaringo * Manuel Córdova-Rios * Jeremy Narby * Indigenous land rights ==NotesReferences== * ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * * * Category:Ayahuasca Category:Indigenous people of the Amazon Category:Living people Category:Peruvian animists Category:Shamanism of the Americas Category:Shamans Category:1952 births Category:People from Ucayali Region ","title":"Guillermo Arévalo"},{"id":"35897858","text":"Jean V may refer to * Jean V de Bretagne (1389–1442) * Jean V of Armagnac (1420–1473) * Jean V de Bueil (1406–1477) ","title":"Jean V"},{"id":"35897864","text":"Viverra leakeyi, also known as Leakey's civet or the giant civet, is an extinct species of civet.

Lily Allen provides backing vocals on the songs \\"Bongo Bong and Je ne t'aime plus\\" and \\"Keep On\\". Williams covers five songs on the album: \\"Louise\\", a 1984 hit for The Human League, \\"Kiss Me\\", the biggest hit for Stephen Duffy, \\"Lovelight\\" by Lewis Taylor, \\"We're the Pet Shop Boys\\" by My Robot Friend, and \\"Bongo Bong and Je ne t'aime plus\\", by Manu Chao. Williams himself spoke fondly of the album upon its release; \\"It has become something on which I've found myself. This is the right direction for me personally, this is what it is. I saw the whole Robbie thing coming to a close as it was, I couldn't make another album like the ones I'd made, and this has just opened up a thousand other doors. What I am excited about now is making more music. I love all the stuff on the album, I love Rudebox, it's a favourite song of mine. I don't know what's gonna happen now, I'm excited about getting it out there, but I'm more excited about making more.\\" The album is a mixture of covers and new tracks, in addition to \\"Summertime\\", a song originally written when Williams left Take That and which appeared in the credits of Mike Bassett: England Manager. Receiving a mixed reception from critics, the album reached the top position in fourteen countries including United Kingdom, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Mexico, Argentina, Spain, Italy and Finland. ==Controversies== \\"She's Madonna\\" was the centre of a tabloid storm after Ashley Hamilton claimed that he came up with part of the song with Williams. Hamilton has claimed he wishes to take the matter to court as he is not credited as a co-writer on the album. Further controversy arose over the track \\"The 90's\\", part of which implies that Williams was ripped off by Take That's manager Nigel Martin-Smith after the band failed to make a profit from a European tour. The song raised the ire of Martin-Smith, who demanded that the song be removed from the album. The omitted lyrics were rapped during the break before the second verse. ==ReceptionCritical reception=== According to review aggregator Metacritic, Rudebox received an average of 53 out of 100 indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\" from music critics, based on reviews from 12 critics. ===Commercial performance=== In the United Kingdom, the album sold 54,667U.K. Midweeks 24/10 (Tuesday) copies on the day of its release, reaching number one on the midweek version of the UK Albums Chart. The next day, the album had sold over 75,000 copies.Midweeks 24/10 (Wednesday) The album debuted at No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart, selling over 147,000 copies in its week of release.U.K. Top 75 – 29 October 2006 Despite reaching number one, sales were far below what was expected by his label EMI and overall sales were overtaken by his former band Take That's Beautiful World. However, the album performed better than Beautiful World outside the UK. The fallout of the album's relative failure led to the firing of two music executives responsible for the album's development. As of December 2013, the album had sold 514,457 copies in the UK. The album was released in the Netherlands on 20 October 2006, on the same day the album was certified platinum as a result of pre-order sales of over 70,000 copies. In Belgium, the album sold 50,000 copies and went platinum. It was released on 23 October 2006 in Australia and debuted at number-one, achieving platinum status in its first week. It has since been certified 2× Platinum. 220,000 copies of the album were sold in France on the week of release, as well as 600,000 in Germany. On 8 November 2006, IFPI certified the album 2× Platinum in Europe with sales of over 2 million copies, making it the fastest platinum selling album of 2006. On 20 November 2006, the album reached number-one in Mexico, becoming Williams' first number-one album there. The album was certified platinum there, with sales of over 100,000 copies.

She was associated with the Canterbury scene and recorded two albums. She exhibited and performed her works in several countries, often combining her painting, poetry and music into multimedia presentations. Richie Unterberger at AllMusic described her as a \\"Bohemian artist\\", and an obituary in The Independent called her \\"a great British eccentric and cosmic prankster\\". ==Biography== June Campbell Cramer was born on 3 June 1931 in Doncaster in Yorkshire, England. Her parents were Scottish and Russian, and she was brought up in Plymouth according to the strict rules of the Plymouth Brethren, a conservative Evangelical Christian movement. In the late 1940s, her father, a fashion retailer, took her to the Spanish island of Majorca, where he introduced her to modelling. June moved to London in the 1950s where she worked as a model and studied at an art college. In the early 1960s she returned to Majorca, where she continued modelling in Palma. In Palma June met several musicians including Daevid Allen and Kevin Ayers, who later became associated with the Canterbury scene and were founding members of the Canterbury bands Gong and Soft Machine. June later moved to the coastal village of Deià on Majorca, home of the English poet Robert Graves. Allen said that in order to live there \\"you had to have some sort of satisfactory relationship with him ... Robert was very tolerant of June, and she hung out with him.\\" June began painting in Deià and put on several exhibitions of her work there as June 'Onion', hanging an onion over each piece as her signature. Her paintings, and later her poetry, were filled with elements of \\"surreal humour\\". In the late 1960s June moved into a flat in Vale Court in Maida Vale, London, which she opened up to many musicians to lodge in or just \\"hang out\\". Allen described her flat as \\"London's premier smoking salon\\", and her role of \\"landlady to many of the capital's more creative musicians\\" spawned her honorary title of \\"Lady\\". She hosted many parties there, including a birthday party in June 1973 for Gilli Smyth, Allen's wife, during which ex-Soft Machine drummer Robert Wyatt broke his back when he fell from a fourth-floor window. By 1970 June was combining her painting, poetry and music into multimedia presentations, and in 1972 she gave performances at a number of venues, including the International Carnival of Experimental Sound in London and the Edinburgh Festival. In 1973 she worked on the BBC Radio 4 series If It's Wednesday It Must Be... with Kenny Everett and Vivian Stanshall, and participated in a Radiophone Workshop for BBC Radio 3. Later that year she recorded Lady June's Linguistic Leprosy, an album of her poetry to music by Ayers, one of her tenants, and Brian Eno, who lived nearby. The recording was made in the front room of her flat in Vale Court with Ayers, Eno and Pip Pyle, and reportedly cost £400. Richie Unterberger at AllMusic called the album \\"an eccentric piece of work\\" with songs that are \\"odd, whimsical, rather surrealistic spoken poems, delivered in a quirkily aristocratic manner\\". June continued performing solo and with other artists, and appeared at several women's festivals in Amsterdam and London. In 1975 she moved back to Deià, where she lived in the artists' commune, and it was here that she was most productive. Ayers said, \\"I think she found what she was looking for ... She had been involved in fashion and didn't really like it. She had a longing to be an artist – at whatever cost – and discovered that in Deià.\\" June maintained contact with the Canterbury scene musicians and groups, and she featured in a Gong concert held in Paris in May 1977. June overcame her shyness by drinking and taking soft drugs, but often tended to over-indulge. Cream lyricist Pete Brown said, \\"She smoked and drank a bit too much ... but her paintings continued to be terrific and so funny.\\" In the mid-1990s June suffered a minor stroke, but this did not deter her work and she continued exhibiting her paintings and giving poetry performances in Deià. In 1996 June released her second record, Hit and Myth, and was working on a third, Rebela, an autobiography/audiobiography with Mark Hewins, featuring some of the members of Gong, Pete Brown, Lol Coxhill and others, when she died of a heart attack in Deià on 7 June 1999. An obituary in The Independent called Lady June \\"a great British eccentric and cosmic prankster\\", and said that her \\"most achieved performance was herself: she succeeded in turning her existence into living art, bristling with humour.\\" ==Discography== *Lady June's Linguistic Leprosy (1974, LP, Caroline Records) *Lady June's Hit and Myth (1996, CD, Gas Records) Source: AllMusic ==References== Category:1931 births Category:1999 deaths Category:20th-century English painters Category:People from Doncaster Category:Canterbury scene Category:Painters from London Category:Writers from London Category:Singers from London Category:Musicians from Yorkshire Category:English people of Scottish descent Category:English people of Russian descent Category:20th-century English poets Category:20th-century English singers Category:20th-century British women artists Category:20th-century English women singers ","title":"Lady June"},{"id":"35897998","text":"A number of steamships were named Westport, including – *, an American passenger ship in service 1911–18 and from 1919 *, an American cargo ship in service 1919–41 *, an American tanker in service 1948–54 Category:Ship names ","title":"SS Westport"},{"id":"35898003","text":"The 2012 Howard Bison football team represented Howard University in the 2012 NCAA Division I FCS football season.

The association aims to be a national center, which cultivates and promotes the engineering, architecture and technology economy, as well as works to promote the professional status of the engineers and architects in Israel. ==History== The Association of Engineers, Architects and Graduates in Technological Sciences in Israel was established in 1922, for the engineers and architects communities and built in Tel-Aviv in 1936 the \\"Engineer and Architect House\\" for its activities. Over the course of the years, the AEAI established professional public institutions such as the Standards Institution of Israel, Israel Institute of Productivity and The Israeli Building Center. In 1985 the AEAI expended, adding up graduates in the technological sciences. The association led to the legislation of the Engineers and Architects Law in the Knesset in 1958. The law regulates the professions of engineering and architecture, and ensures that the public receives professional services (planning, counseling, supervision and performance) only from those authorized for that purpose. This law has been modified, the last of which was in 1992. ==Legal status== The association is acknowledged in the Engineers and Architects law, in the Planning and Building law, in the Standards law and in the Free Production Zone law. The association is also acknowledged by the Ministry of Industry (responsible by the government for the Engineers and Architects law), as the representative organization for engineering and architecture professions in Israel. The association is recognized by the chief justice and the courts administration as the professional and public organization, responsible for appointing experts and arbitrators as a service to the Israeli courthouse. The association also appoints the public's professional representatives in the local building and planning committees, the regional ones, the national council etc. ==Institutes== There is a National Congress in the AEAI, chosen by all its members in a proportional representation election. The senior positions, such as the president, the chairman, the professional societies chairmen etc., are voluntary. The AEAI current president is Eng. Yitzhak Raz. The association chairman is Eng. Ehud Noff, who also serves as chairman of the Federation of Engineers (the labor union). Within the Association of Engineers there are professional societies in various technological fields: Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Chemistry, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Industrial and Management Engineering, Safety Engineering, Computer Science and Software, Construction and Infrastructure Engineering, Architecture and City planning and Municipal Engineering. The branches within the professional societies operate on specific or multi-disciplinary issues. \\\\- There are four regional centers: Tel Aviv and the Center, Haifa and the North, Beer Sheva and the south and Jerusalem. Recently the AEAI had also activated branches in workplaces employing a large number of engineers, such as: Israel Aircraft Industries, the Military Industry, Bezeq and the IDF Employees. ==Activities within the association== \\\\- Professional updates via courses, national and international conferences, seminars, professional tours, professional lectures, etc., in order to regularly expose the engineers to innovations in their fields, and thus improve and promote their professional level. Members enjoy significant discounts in these activities. \\\\- Initiating and changing legislation in the fields of engineering and technology, in order to make sure that the general public will receive services only from those authorized for that purpose. \\\\- Representation of the engineering professions in public and statutory institutions: the Association of Engineers has nine representatives in the Engineering and Architecture Council. The association has also representatives in other important institutions, such as: the Israeli Standards Institution, the Higher Education Institution, Knesset committees, regional and local construction committees etc., allowing a direct influence on the economy. \\\\- Appointing arbitrators and experts as a service to the Israeli courthouse and the general public. \\\\- Relationships with parallel organizations in Israel and abroad. \\\\- Relationships with academic institutions, in which the engineering, architecture, science and technology subjects are studied, as well as establishing and maintaining connections with the industry. \\\\- Integration of engineering students and young graduates in the associations' professional activities, in order to nurture the next generation. \\\\- Publications of relevant information via the Association Website and newsletters. ==Former key figures== {  - !

Burriana was an important Muslim city, being the capital of La Plana, Valencia. It was known as the \\"Green City\\". The city was besieged for two months, finally falling to the forces of James I in July 1233. == Context == In 1229, the city of Valencia, known to the Muslims as \\"Balansiya\\", had fallen to the forces under the command of Zayyan ibn Mardanish, a local leader who was opposed to the Almohades. In capturing that city, he dethroned Zayd Abu Zayd, who subsequently fled to the Kingdom of Aragon. James I of Aragon used this as a casus belli to intervene in the Muslim civil war on the side of the Almohades, but in reality with the pretext of expanding his own territory. Two Aragonese knights, Hugo de Follalquer, Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, and Blas de Aragón, who had just returned from a period of exile in Valencia, met with Jaime I at Alcañiz. They recounted stories of the prosperity of the Muslim kingdom and encouraged the king to conquer it in 1233. == Consequences == After taking Burriana, the castles to the north continued to fall into Aragonese hands one by one including; Peniscola, Castelló de la Plana, Borriol, les Coves de Vinromà and Vilafamés. Three years later, the decisive Battle of the Puig sealed the conquest in 1236. == See also == * Reconquista == References == * The information on this page was translated from its Spanish equivalent. === Bibliography === Category:1233 in Europe Category:Conflicts in 1233 Burriana Burriana Category:Battles involving the Taifa of Valencia Category:13th century in Aragon Burriana Burriana Category:13th century in Al-Andalus Category:Battles of the Reconquista ","title":"Siege of Burriana"},{"id":"35898093","text":"Arthur March (23 February 1891 – 17 April 1957) was an Austrian physicist.

The working life of Hero first ended in 1957, but it was later restored c2000 as a first class luxury paddle steamer finely fitted-out for private charters. ==History== PS Hero - Echuca Wharf circa 1940. Source State Library SA The Hero traded on the Murrumbidgee River as a hawking vessel until the 1930s when sold to Arbuthnot Sawmills at Koondrook as a logging boat. The company also owned the PS Alexander Arbuthnot. In 1942, the Hero and two barges (John Campbell and Cannally) were purchased by the Forests Commission Victoria from Arbuthnot Sawmills and moved to Echuca. One of the pressing requirements during the War was to organise emergency supplies of firewood for a range of uses including military and civilian heating and cooking, and as a substitute for coal for locomotives because of a miners strike at Wonthaggi. PS Hero, under well known Captain Spencer (Spinny) Clark, was used to transport the much needed redgum logs from near Yielima in the Barmah State forest about 80 upstream to Echuca wharf. The two loaded barges were floated downstream from the forest to Echuca and the logs cut into foot blocks before being taken by rail to Melbourne. At one stage, annual production was upward of half a million tonnes. Most of the labour was provided by Italian internees. In 1950 the Hero and barges were sold to the Collins Brothers and moved to Mildura. Later, in 1956, the Hero sold to Chislett Brothers at Boundary Bend, Victoria, and again worked as a logging boat. During the 1952 and 1956 floods in Australia, Hero was used for various flood mitigation purposes. In January 1957 Hero caught fire at Boundary Bend, near Robinvale, and sank. Over the years it was stripped and slowly deteriorated. Its paddle wheels were removed and installed on the PV Pride of the Murray. In 1989, Gary and Irene Byford purchased Hero. They raised it in February 1998 and removed the boiler and engine. The hull was moved to Echuca where it was restored and re-launched on 16 September 2000, the 126th anniversary of its original launch. ==Particulars== Hero is 28 metres long and can carry up to 75 passengers. Its original steam engines have been refitted. ==ReferencesExternal links == * The history of Hero * List of Murray–Darling steamboats Category:Paddle steamers of Australia Category:1874 ships Category:Echuca- Moama ","title":"PS Hero"},{"id":"35898133","text":"Ngwenya is a town in Swaziland.

French composer Charles-Valentin Alkan composed one, which was published in 1857. José Vianna da Motta wrote of it, \\"Alkan demonstrates his brilliant understanding of [symphonic] form in the first movement of the Symphony (the fourth Study [of his Op. 39]). ... The tonalities are so carefully calculated and developed that anyone listening to it can relate each note to an orchestral sound; and yet it is not just through the sonority that the orchestra is painted and becomes tangible, but equally through the style and the way that the polyphony is handled.\\" Several decades later, Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji wrote his Third Piano Sonata (1922), which he described as a piano symphony.Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji to Philip Heseltine, 19 June 1922, quoted in Sorabji: A Critical Celebration, ed.

The museum hosts working models of various types of trains. It was started by Bhausaheb Joshi. ==History== The museum was conceptualized and started by B. S. Joshi, popularly known as Bhausaheb Joshi. Through his childhood hobby of collecting and making models, he started working on this concept in the 1960s. He initially made mobile working models, which he would set up in various cities for the public to view. His first exhibition took place in Pune at the Gokhale Hall in 1982. In 1984 the layout was displayed in Mumbai (then Bombay) and again in 1986, in Pune's Dastur High School. It was then that Joshi decided to have a permanent exhibition to avoid the inconveniences of mobile models. The present layout of the museum was fabricated in 1991 and the museum opened on 1 April 1998. Over time the layout was enlarged with many additions of digital controls and multiple models. The museum's present proprietor is Dr. Ravi Joshi, Bhausaheb's son. ==On exhibit== The model trains on exhibition run through a miniature city and are presented with a son et lumière show. The layout includes 65 signals, fences, lamp posts, flyovers, etc. and can be controlled manually as well as through a computer. In 2011 it has working models of \\"10 - 15\\" types of trains, including steam engines, the bullet train and a mini sky-train. In 2003, the museum developed a miniature railway that interacts with other equipment and simulates train movements. This project, the first of its kind in India, was executed for HBLnife, a company that manufactures and supplies batteries, high-frequency track circuit data loggers, digital axle counters and electronic interlocking systems to the Indian Railways. The model is the first ever scale model in India that is digitally controlled and can simulate movements of trains. Since 2003, the museum is an India distributor for international brands such as Fleischmann, Roco and Hornby Railways that make scale models of railways. \\"Trainz\\", the hobby centre of the museum intends, according to Ravi Joshi, to popularize train modelling and impart basic knowledge about it. Currently the charges for the individual consist of Rs 90 for an individual, kids below 3 years are not charged. The museum also has its own manufacturing unit. The museum sells miniature railway kits on site and also supplies models to Switzerland, Australia and the Indian Railways. In 2007 it manufactured a scale model of the Jungfrau Railway, Europe's highest railway, and received an order for 2000 sets, which will be sold at the stations of the railway. The models are made by the injection moulding process. The museum is included in the attractions covered by the Pune Municipal Corporation's one-day city tour bus. The road on which the museum is located has been named after Bhau Joshi . ==See also== * National Rail Museum, New Delhi * Rewari Railway Heritage Museum * Regional Railway Museum, Chennai * Railway Museum Mysore * Railway Heritage Centre, Tiruchirappalli ==References * Category:Museums in Pune Category:Railway museums in India Category:Miniature railways in India Category:Model railway shows and exhibitions ","title":"Joshi's Museum of Miniature Railway"},{"id":"35898246","text":"Noirot is a French surname.

The voters elected local posts in the city: the mayor, vice mayor, the two Congressmen (or district representatives), and the councilors, six in each of the city's two legislative districts. Representative Rexlon Gatchalian, a brother to the current mayor Sherwin, is running for the city mayor's office for the first time. Gatchalian's primary opponent is Adelma Gunigundo, wife of the incumbent second district representative Magtanggol Gunigundo. Gatchalian's running mate is vice mayor Eric Martinez, who has served since 2007; if he wins, we will have his term limited in 2016. First district councilor Katherine Pineda-Hernandez is Gunigundo's running mate. The election was won by Gatchalian and Martinez for the local posts. ==Mayoral and vice mayoral election== Incumbent mayor Sherwin Gatchalian is now on his third term as the mayor of Valenzuela. As prescribed by the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines, he is barred from running as the mayor and he may choose to run into higher or lower office instead. Prior to his election as mayor in 2004, he represented the first district of Valenzuela from 2001 to 2004. In April 2012, he signed his intention to run for the Senate race under the Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino party headed by former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada. He instead would run as representative of the 1st District of the city. His brother, incumbent congressman Rexlon Gatchalian who is on his second term is running in his place. Rexlon Gatchalian, also known as Rex, is on his second term as district representative/congressman, hence he is not yet term limited. Rex entered Valenzuela politics in 2007 occupying his current post. The other candidate for mayorship is Adelma A. Yang-Gunigundo, wife to the incumbent second district representative Magtanggol Gunigundo. There are only two candidates for vice mayor's office: incumbent vice mayor and Liberal's Eric M. Martinez and incumbent first district councilor Katherine \\"Khay\\" C. Pineda. == Congressional elections == There are two and three candidates for the congressman or district representative post of the districts 1 and 2 of Valenzuela, respectively. The city is divided into two congressional districts: the first district encompasses 23 barangays in the northern portion of the city and the second district which contains 9 barangays. The incumbent first district representative Rexlon \\"Rex\\" Gatchalian running under the Nationalist People's Coalition, the same political party he had during the 2007 election. Gatchalian, a businessman, is the younger brother of the incumbent mayor Sherwin Gatchalian. The other candidate for congressman is Ritche Cuadra, a member of Valenzuela City Council since 2001. For the second district, the incumbent representative Magtanggol \\"Magi\\" Gunigundo will run under the Lakas-Kampi-CMD party. A lawyer by profession, he became the representative of the former municipality of Valenzuela from 1998-2001. If he will be elected to office in 2013, this will be his third term, thus he is not eligible to re-election in 2016 for the same position. The second candidate is Shalani Carla \\"Lani\\" Soledad-Romulo, a member of the Valenzuela city council and wife to Pasig Representative Roman Romulo. Soledad-Romulo gained prominence as a former girlfriend to President Benigno Aquino III from 2008-2010 and as a TV host at television network TV5 since 2010. The other candidate for congressman is Pablo \\"Pabs\\" Hernandez III, a columnist from the tabloid Bulgar who ran for the mayoralty race inn 2010. Unlike in 2010 polls, few of the people who run for the city council are up for reelection. For the first district, this list includes Idol Alejandrino, Cora Cortez and Tony Espiritu; Adrian Dapat, Cecil Mayo, Lorie Natividad-Borja, and Lai Nolasco for the second district. Two of candidates from each district are also former members of the council: Mar Morelos and Lotlot Esteban. Rovin Feliciano and Ricarr Enriquez are barangay captains of Arkong Bato and Pasolo, respectively. Genny Esplana who targets the first district council, is the titleholder for the 1990 Bb. Pilipinas-International; Charee Pineda, who vies second district councils, is a member of ABS-CBN's Star Magic circle and held the lead role in 2011 daytime drama series Angelito: Batang Ama. == Mock polls == Mock polls are done in different parts of the city to survey possible winners to the 2013 midterm elections. Based on a February 2013 mock polls done by the Valenzuela City District Two Voters Group, an independent non-government group, conducted by former dean Rolando Lansigan, the following candidates garnered the spot for the second district: {class=\\"sortable \\" style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" +Mayoral race (February 2013, 2nd District) !

These positions are voted separately, so there is a possibility that the winning officials came from the same or different political parties. ===Mayoral election=== Incumbent Sherwin T. Gatchalian is running for representative of the city's first district. ===Vice mayoral election=== Incumbent Eric M. Martinez is running for reelection. ===Congressional elections=== First district Incumbent Rexlon Gatchalian is running for the mayorship; his brother, Mayor Sherwin Gatchalian, is his party's nominee. Second district Magtanggol Gunigundo is the incumbent. He will be facing off against councilor Shalani Soledad-Romulo, if Soledad-Romulo elected she will join her husband Roman in the House separately. ===City council elections === The voters in the city are set to elect six councilors on the district where they are living, hence registered. Candidates are voted separately so there are chances where winning candidates will have unequal number of votes and may come from different political parties.

The game met with mixed reviews, with many reviewers noting that there were better Kairosoft simulation games. ==Gameplay== The player takes control of a restaurant, which they must build up to a high quality restaurant chain. Players must simultaneously deal with a number of issues at the same time, such as managing staff and researching new food items. In order to operate the restaurant, the player must have cash on hand; each April in- game, the player's staff's salary is charged, and the player must adapt with less money. You don't have to pay salaries on the first month ==Reception== Cafeteria Nipponica met with mixed reviews from critics, who felt that the downtime found in the game was detrimental towards its enjoyment. Eurogamer Chris Schilling felt that the game was a success, despite being heavily similar to other Kairosoft titles. Schilling noted that it did enough to \\"feel fresh\\". Pocket Gamer Damien McFarren criticized the game for long waiting periods where the player has to wait for money to come back in from sales after paying employees. He believed that it was not Kairosoft's finest hour, but still called it \\"not a bad game either\\". Gamezebo's Mike Rose felt that the five- to ten-minute waits for the game to become actionable again as the player waited for money to come into their accounts was, \\"a very poor system\\". ==References== Category:2012 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Business simulation games Category:IOS games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Cafeteria Nipponica"},{"id":"35898348","text":"Puricelli is an Italian surname.

Afféú Fangani ‘Join Together’: A Morphophonemic Analysis Of Possessive Suffix Paradigms And A Discourse-Based Ethnography Of The Elicitation Session In Pakin Lukunosh Mortlockese. University of Hawai'i at Mānoa Ph.D. dissertation. It is nearly intelligible with Satawalese, with an 18 percent intelligibility and an 82 percent lexical similarity, and Puluwatese, with a 75 percent intelligibility and an 83 percent lexical similarity. The language today has become mutually intelligible with Chuukese, though marked with a distinct Mortlockese accent. Linguistic patterns show that Mortlockese is converging with Chuukese since Mortlockese now has an 80 to 85 percent lexical similarity. There are approximately five to seven thousand speakers of Mortlockese in the Mortlock Islands, Guam, Hawaii, and the United States. There are at least eleven different dialects that show some sort of correspondence to the Mortlock Island groups. ==Classification== Mortlockese is an Austronesian language currently holding a 6b language status, meaning that it is threatened with extinction. More specifically, a language is given the 6b language status when it is only used for in-person communication (i.e., not written language), with a decline in the number of speakers. In the nuclear Micronesian languages, Mortlockese Language falls under the Chuukic category. One factor contributing to the present endangerment of Mortlockese are natural disasters, such as the typhoon that struck the Mortlock Islands in 1907. Such natural disasters kill many speakers of Mortlockese, and since the language is primarily transmitted orally, this removes many outlets for passing on the culture and language to youth. ==History== Image of Mortlock Islands taken by satelliteThe Mortlock islands, where Mortlockese is mainly spoken, is estimated to have had its first settlement around eight hundred to nine hundred years ago. There is evidence showing that the Mortlockese Language originated from the Chuuk Lagoon since many Mortlock natives trace their history back to the Chuuk Lagoon islands. Along with the genealogies, many clans that exist in the Mortlock islands also exist in the Chuuk Lagoon islands. In 1907, there was a typhoon that hit the Mortlock island Ta which caused the people there to move to Saipan and Pohnpei. Now, Mortlockese Language speakers can be found not only on the Mortlock islands, but also on Saipan and Pohnpei. Documenting the language by writing it down was uncommon; instead, stories were passed down orally, which leads to less available documented history. Children learned from their parents and the stories told by relatives. The main role of girls growing up was to help their mothers and learn household tasks. For the boys, more “masculine” tasks such as fishing were promoted. Family life was important, and obedience was widely accepted by children in fear of a supernatural power punishing them. Myths and folktales told stories of religious and cultural beliefs passed down. Family is important to the Mortlock natives. Family structure is important and different rules are followed depending on the different islands. In several cases, the woman is head of the family. Sleeping arrangements may mean men in large homes separate from the women and children. Friendships are also extremely important within the Mortlockese culture. Friendship was more of a “brotherhood.” It is noted that if a friendship was formed between two people, each of the other’s family members became family as well. As early as January 1874, missionaries visited the islands and began building schools to teach the natives religious ways of life. Their main efforts were to increase awareness of Puritanism. European clothes were introduced, as well as the prohibition of drugs and alcohol. There was concern of children in school falling out of touch with their native ways. The history and traditions of the Natives was approved and a new course was updated and continued for years. According to several documents, several changes to the curriculum were made to incorporate native traditions as well as to introduce new information from the Europeans. The most common historical belief is that the Mortlock people arrived on the islands in canoes. Over the span of the 19th century, traders continued to document their visits to the islands allowing evidence of residency. In 1907 a typhoon hit the Mortlock islands, destroying homes, and killing hundreds. Unfortunately, natural disasters, war, and other changes to the islands are to blame for the little to no documentation of the Mortlock history and language. What is left is the writings of missionaries who visited the island to teach the word of God, and to translate the Mortlockese Language into biblical text. There are documents of what curriculum was taught in the schools opened, as well as the number of students and teachers present. There are also certain rules that are noted in several cases implying that words are not always what they seem. In terms of family and kinship, personal names were used when referring to family instead of terms like “cousin,” or “grandparent.” Kinship terms categorize relatives instead of label them directly. This is just one example of grammar we can study from the way the Mortlockese language is designed. ==Geographic distribution== Map of the Federated States of Micronesia The Mortlockese language is spoken in the Chuuk state. It is spoken in eleven distinct dialects over the eleven Mortlock Islands (Ettal, Kutt, Lekinioch, Losap, Moch, Nama, Namoluk, Oneop, Piis-Emwar, Satowan, Ta), all of which have mutual intelligibility. Speakers of Mortlockese are able to discern where other speakers are from, whether a different island or a different village, based on nuanced variations in speech patterns. There are approximately five to seven thousand speakers of the language, located mostly on the Mortlock Islands and throughout Micronesia, but also on the Pacific Islands (Hawaii and Guam in particular) and in the United States of America. In March 1907, in the wake of destruction caused by a typhoon that struck the Mortlock island Ta killing half the population there, the Mortlock people living on that island relocated to Saipan and Pohnpei.Chuuk State Census Report, 2000 On Pohnpei, the Mortlocks spoke one of three Mortlockese dialects along with Pohnpeian or English as a second language in the multilingual community they formed. After a number of years, Mortlockese people living in Pohnpei returned to Pakin Atoll in the Mortlock Islands, where they spoke the kapsen Mwoshulok dialect, exhibiting adaptation and evolution, while retaining Pohnpeian as a second language. English is the national language in the Mortlock islands; however, most only use it when interacting with people from other places or in school. Rather than English, Mortlockese and Pohnpeian are the common spoken languages. The Lukunosh dialect is one of the Southernmost Mortlockese dialects. ==Phonology== Lukunosh, a dialect of Mortlockese, has nine vowel phonemes and 15 consonant phonemes. {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" - +Vowel phonemes ! !Front !Central !Back - !High i ʉ u - !Upper-Mid   o - !Mid  ɞ  - !Lower-Mid ɛ  ɔ - !Low æ a  } Table retrieved from pg.100 of Odango, Emmerson. {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" - +Consonant phonemes ! !Bilabial !Bilabial (rounded) !Labio- dental !Dental !Alveolar !Alveo- palatal !Palatal !Velar - !Stops  pw       - !Nasals  mw       - !Fricatives         - !Affricates         - !Trill         - !Lateral Approximant         - !Glides         } Table retrieved from pg.96 of Odango, Emmerson. Gemination is possible for all consonants. (pg.98) Syllables are in the form of (C)(C)V(V)(C)(C), where (C) is an optional consonant and (V) is an optional vowel. An example of a CCVVCC syllable is so.ko.ppaat (meaning assorted in Lukunosh Mortlockese). (pg.110) === Reduplication === Reduplication occurs in some verbs to express extreme measure. It may also indicate an imperfective or habitual aspect. {  a. /ŋiimw alɛɛtɛj/ - 'hate him/her/it' /ŋii~mw al~mw alɛɛtɛj/ - 'really hate him/her/it' - b. /jææjæ/ - 'to use something' /jæj~jææjæ/ - 'to use something repeatedly or habitually' } == Numbers and counting == The counting system in Mortlockese is a base 10 system. The following table includes the numbers used in serial counting, which can also be modified by numeral classifiers. {  - ! Number !! Mortlockese -  1  “-t” -  2  “ruwa-” -  3  “elú-” -  4  “faa-” -  5  “lima-” -  6  “wono-” -  7  “fúsú-” -  8  “walú-” -  9  “tiwa-” } Table retrieved from p.50 of A preliminary survey of the economic and social life of the Mortlock Islands people Serial counting requires use of the prefix “e-” and use of any number with a classifier changes the word of “one” from “-e” to “-te.” Numeral classifiers are used to relate an object’s characteristics, and examples include “-man” for the counting of animate subjects, “-faú” for round-shaped objects, and “-shé” for objects that are long. Possessive classifiers are used to indicate the relationship between a number of objects and the possessor of the objects. == Dialects == There are eleven different dialects in the Mortlockese Language and according to researchers, speakers of Mortlockese can tell the difference between the different Mortlockese dialects. Most of these differences are in how words sound and how the spellings of words differ. {  !Word !Piis-Emwmwar !Lukunosh !Satawan !Té - chicken mélúk malek malek malak - to go ló la ló ló - inside llón llan llón llón - to sleep méúr maur maúr méúr - to go with eeti itei iti / eti etei - land fénú fanéú fanú fénú - from sengi sangei sangi sengei - large ant sp. uukéch ukash ukosh ukésh - dog kolaak kómwia komwia Monday - Monday Saranfál Mástánfal Saranfál Mistánfél - Tuesday Aruwou Aruwowan Aruwowan Ráán Ruwou - Saturday Ammól Ráán Amwól Ráán Amwól Ráán Ukumw - small ant sp. lúúlú lengeleng likúkkútong / lengúleng lúlú } Table retrieved from pg.24 of Odango, Emmerson. ==Grammar== The different dialects of Mortlockese have varying degrees of place deixis. For example, Lukunosh Mortlockese as spoken in Pukin has four levels of diexis (near speaker, near listener, far from speaker and listener, in the minds of speaker and listener) while Kúttú Mortlockese has five levels. In addition to common nouns and proper nouns are relational nouns, which are further divided into three categories: oblique, locational, and partitive. Subject markers help to interpret either anaphoric arguments or grammatical agreements. Object markers show the third person singular object suffix where there is an overt object. Both the third person singular object suffix and the other non third person singular object suffixes act as an anaphoric agreement when there is no overt object. === Noun phrases === A noun phrase is at minimum a bare noun. This bare noun can then be modified by demonstratives, possessive, and numeral classifiers. It is also possible to attach the stative TAM marker /mii/ after a bare noun and then add an adjective. An example is /uuʃ/ 'banana' turning into /uuʃ mii par/ 'red banana'. The structure of noun phrases generally follow the form: (Numeral) (possessive) (noun) (possessive suffix) (demonstrative suffix) (stative) (adjective). (pg.129) === Verb phrases === Verb phrases follow the form (Proclitic prefix) (subject) (TAM marker) (optional adverb) (verb) (suffix) (directional suffix) (object or noun), giving Mortlockese an SVO sentence structure. Subject pronouns used in the sentence are followed by an aspect morpheme, with only one aspect morpheme per clause. The only preposition used in the Mortlockese language is /mɞ/. == Nouns == Common or base nouns have no prefixes or suffixes and can be used with classifiers for counting. They can also be further categorized by possessive classifiers which indicate the relationship between the possessor and object as being indirect or alienable, and possessive suffixes are used to indicate direct or inalienable possession. Some nouns also indicate the specific use for the object in question, including the nature of how it is to be used by the subject in a sentence. Nouns can be modified by adjectives, demonstratives, and numeral classifiers and modified nouns will usually undergo vowel lengthening from (C)(V)(C) to (C)(V)(V)(C). Types of nouns in Mortlockese include proper nouns, relational nouns (which cannot be modified and are used to indicate inalienable possession), oblique nouns, locational nouns, and partitive nouns. == Verbs  Intransitive verbs === Intransitive verbs in Mortlockese are described by two separate classes. The first class is “unaccusatives”, which are linked to adjectives and can show that the object is undergoing a process or action. The other class is “unergatives,” which are more like actual verbs in that they describe actions rather than a state of being. Both types of intransitive verbs have related transitive verb forms. === Transitive verbs === Transitive verbs require the use of direct object suffixes which reference the object of the phrase. These include prepositional verbs, which are used with a direct object suffix and are not used with causitives or reduplication to indicate different aspects. Transitive verbs in Mortlockese can be used alone or as followed by a direct object noun phrase in a clause. == Adverbs == Adverbs can come before or after the verb in a sentence. Combining an adjective with the morpheme /lɛ/ and a verb will result in a form that roughly translates to the form of an English adverb ending with “-ly”. == Pronouns == Four types of pronouns are used in Mortlockese. The first type, independent pronouns, can be used either as the subject or direct object of a phrase or sentence. Different variations or forms may be used or preferred in the different dialects, but all of the forms are interchangeable. Subject proclitics are used to indicate the number of persons being talked about as the subject. An example of linguistic metathesis is shown in the variation of the third-person plural sunject proclitic pronoun /ɛr=/ to /rɛ=/ where the use of either is accepted, but an individual speaker will only choose to use one form. Direct object suffix pronouns are used to indicate the number of persons being talked about as the direct object of a phrase or sentence. Lastly, possessive suffix pronouns are used to indicate the number of possessors and the relationship between the speaker and the possessor. A verb can be combined with causative prefixes, transitive third-person direct object suffixes and thematic vowels (the inclusion of which depends on whether the ending of the verb is a vowel or a consonant) to create descriptive clauses that include pronouns. The different dialects will have different ways of modifying verbs and pronouns; likewise, generational differences yield different forms of word modifications. Independent pronouns are used in response to WH questions. == Demonstratives == Singular and plural demonstratives are used to indicate proximity to the speaker or listener, and what number of objects there are. These words have the English equivalents of “this,” “that,” “here,” “there,” and the like. These can also be modified to indicate other qualities of the subject, such as in recalling something from the past that is not present with the speakers at the time they choose to discuss it. == Conjunctions == The two types of conjunctions in Mortlockese are subordinators and coordinators. == Possessive classifiers == The possessive classifier acts as the base of the word, and indicates the relationship of the possessum noun to the possessor. The general possessive classifier in Lukunosh is [jaa-]. === Possessive suffixes === {  1SG  -j - 2SG  -mw - 3SG  - - 1 PL.INCL  -ʃ - 1 PL.EXCL  -mam - 2PL  -mi - 3PL  -r - CONST  -n } When attaching possessive suffixes to consonant-final words, a vowel is placed between the final consonant and the suffix. An example is [maas] (eye, face) becoming [masan] (their eye, face). The form [masn] is phonetically possible in Mortlockese, but is deemed impossible by speakers. ==Vocabulary== Certain words cannot be spoken in the presence of the opposite sex. This gender- restrictive vocabulary, sometimes called cookhouse speech, may only be used when speaking to people of the same gender. This gender-restrictive vocabulary shows an example of avoidance speech, a type of honorific, in the Mortlockese Language. Mortlockese is a matrilineal society, considering the patrilineal lineage as secondary. The Mortlockese vocabulary includes terms to denote siblings and cousins of the same gender, and different terms to refer siblings and cousins of the opposite gender. Verbs can be transitive, intransitive(unergative or unaccusitive), or semitransitive. ==References External links == * A collection of Mortlockese recordings are available through Kaipuleohone * http://unravellingmag.com/articles/kapasen-mwoshlok/ Category:Chuukic languages Category:Endangered Austronesian languages Category:Languages of the Federated States of Micronesia ","title":"Mortlockese language"},{"id":"35898359","text":"Potgieter is a Germanic occupational surname, equivalent to the English surname Potter.

It is spoken on Poluwat. == Classification == Puluwatese has two dialects: Pulapese and Pulusukes, all of which have low intelligibility with Satawalese (64%), Woleaian (40%), and Ulithian (21%). Puluwatese does however have slightly higher lexical similarity with Satawalese and Carolinian (88%), Mortlockese (83%), Woleaian (82%), Chuukese (81%), and Ulithian (72%). == Orthography  Vowels === * a - [æ] * á - [a] * e - [ɛ] * é - [e] * i - [i] * o - [o] * ó - [ɔ] * u - [u] * ú - [ɨ] === Consonants === * c - [t͡ʃ] * f - [f] * h - [h] * k - [k] * l - [l] * m - [m] * mw - [mʷˠ] * n - [n] * ng - [ŋ] * p - [pʷˠ] * r - [r] * ŕ - [ɹ] * s - [s] * t - [t] * w - [w] * y - [j] Long vowels and consonants are indicated by doubling their letters.Puluwatese language on Omniglot == Phonology  Syllable Structure === The syllables in Puluwatese begin with either consonants or geminal consonants followed by a vowel or geminal vowel and can be ended with either a consonant or a vowel. The different syllable structure types are as follows: * CV: kirh we * CVV: rhúú bone * CVC: wiki blow * CVVC: niiy kill-him * CVVCC: wiill wheel * CVCC: wuut bath house * CCV: ppi sand * CCVV: kkúú fingernails * CCVC: llón in * CCVVC: amwiik pepper * CCVCC: ppóh steady === Consonants === {  + - Stops and affricate p pw t c k - Fricatives f s h   - Nasals m mw n ng  - Liquids l r ŕ   - Glides w y    } In the voicing of consonants, nasals, liquids, and glides are always voiced. Voiceless consonants consist of stops and fricatives and usually follow a pattern of being voiceless initially, weakly voiced medially, and voiceless at the end. Puluwatese consists of long consonants ccòwo (heavy) and short consonants ppel (light). Long consonants are considered more forceful and are often used to display an emotion such as fear. Such an example is the word for hide-and seek/ tow-the-ghost: likohhomà. In this case, the \\"hh\\" long consonant creates a heavy sound that is used to frighten children. An interesting pattern in consonant replacement occurs where /w-/ and /y-/ glides replace /k-/ in some words. Some of the most commonly heard forms are as follows: * kapong, yapong-i-y to greet * kereker, yereker rat * wo, ko you (polite) * woow, koow coconut fiber * yáát, káát boy * ya-mwar, ka-mwar to hold * yéé, kéé fishhook Other consonant interchange patterns involve /c/ and /r/ which can be traced back to Trukese influence. Oftentimes, the Truk consonant /c/ and the Puluwat /r/ correspond such as in the words: * caw, raw slow * céccén, réccén wet * ceec, reec to tremble /k/ and /kk/ may also be used interchangeably as follows: * kltekit small, yátakkit small * rak only, mákk write While consonant clusters do not occur in Puluwatese, there are several instances of consonant combinations occurring. These consonant combinations are often interrupted by a vowel referred to as an Excrescent. Sometimes, the intersyllabic vowel is lost and a consonant cluster can occur. The historically noted consonant combinations are as follows: * kf: yekiyekféngann to think together * np: tayikonepék fish species * nf: pwonféngann to promise together * nm: yinekinmann serious * nl: fanefanló patient * nw: yóónwuur canoe part * ngf: llónghamwol termite * wp: liyawpenik cormorant * wh: yiwowhungetá to raise === Vowels === {  ! !Front !Central !Back - High i ù u - Medium e è o - Low à a ò } Vowel distribution is limited and occur finally. Vowels may present themselves as short or long and can change to a lower pitch when lengthened. While all syllables are stressed fairly evenly, stressed syllables are often denoted as capitals. The following are two rules that determine stressed syllables: # Final vowels in CVCV words are stressed such as in hanA hibiscus, klyÒ outrigger boom, ylfA? where?, and ylwE then # Syllables that follow the letter h are normally stressed: yapawahAalò to dry out, pahAlò to drift away, yekúhÚ rak just a little Unstressed syllables often occur as excrescent vowels except for when they follow h- and are denoted by breves. Unstressed vowels occur in the following instances: * Vowels in between reduplicated words are often unstressed: ** ngeŕ- ĕ -ngeŕ to sew ** ngeŕ- ĭ -ngeŕ to gnaw ** pwul- ă -pwul red ** yale- ĕ yái young man ** yál- ĭ -yel retreat * Vowels between bases and suffixes (directional and first person plural exclusive pronoun suffix): ** fanúw- ĕ -mám our ** mópw- ŭ -ló to drown ** nlike- ĕ -mem- ĕ -ló attack us all ** yállew- ŭ -ló worse * Vowels following -n, the construct form suffix and the initial consonant: ** n + p: lúkúnĭ paliyewowuh beyond the outer side ** n + k: máánĭ kiiiiló hunger death ** n + m: roonĭ maan floating ripe coconuts ** n + y: wòònĭ Yáley on Yáley * Vowels in loan words that often contain consonant clusters: ** s+t: Sĭtien Steven ** m+ s: Samĭson Samson ** f+k: Maŕĕkús Markus * In words that follow the shape of C1V1C2V2C3V3 the V1 and V3 vowels are normally stressed while the V2 has a week stress: ** TilĭmE male name ** yeŕŏmA a tree == Pronouns == Independent pronouns, subject pronouns, and polite vocatives are the three types of pronouns that occur in differing distributions. Independent pronouns occur alone and in equational sentences, they precede noun or noun phrases, as well as subject pronouns, or the prepositions me, and, and with. Subject pronouns never occur as objects and always precede verbs, normally with intervening particles. The use of polite vocatives are rare in daily life and even rarer in texts. However, the known polite vocatives are included in the table below. {  ! !Before proper names, 'person' !Clause - final - To a male or males ko, ŕewe wo, ko keen ŕewe - To a female or females ne ne - To males or females keen kææmi } The polite vocatives that occur before a proper name may most closely be translated to Mr, Miss, or Mrs, but there are no accurate translations for the clause-final polite vocatives. Independent and subject pronouns occur in seven propositions: first person singular (1s, 2s, 3s), first person plural inclusive (1p inc), first person plural exclusive (1p exc, 2p, 3p), and is illustrated in the table below. {  + ! !Independent Pronoun !Subject Pronoun - 1s ngaang, nga yiy, wu - 2s yeen wo - 3s yiiy ye, ya - 1p inc kiir hi, hay - 1p exc yææmen yæy - 2p yææmi yaw, yɔw - 3p yiiŕ ŕe, ŕa } == Word order == For transitive sentences, Puluwatese follows a SVO word order but an SV or VS structure for intransitive sentences. SVO: Wuŕumwo ya yákékkél-ee-ŕ yát-e-kkit mákk. Wuŕumwo 3s teach-SV-3pl.obj child-EV-small writing 'Wuŕumwo taught the children writing.' SV: Ye-ray eŕemahán Polowat a fáyi-to. one-CL manPuluwat perf come-hither 'A Puluwat man has come.' VS: Ye pwe le mááló manú-hmwaay we. 3s T(fut) imm.fut die dem-SV-sick dem 'the sick man will soon die.' == Counting system == Numbers in Puluwatese are confusing because there is such an intricate system of suffixes for counting different objects. In general, the base of the number stays the same and suffixes for different objects are added onto each base of the number. Suffixes that are added onto the base numbers can significantly alter the meaning of the word such as in the example ye-ray woong (a small turtle) and yee-w woong (a large turtle). For counted objects, suffixes can greatly change their meaning such as in ye-fay teŕeec (a spool of thread) and ye-met teŕeec (a piece of thread). The most common counting suffixes are outlined in the following table. {  + !Sequential !General -oow !Animate -ray -man !Long Objects -fór !Round Objects -fay !Flat Objects -réé !Hundreds -pwúkúw - 1. yé-ét yee-w ye-ray  -ye  -ye  -yé  -ye - 2. rúúw ŕuw-oow ŕuw-oow ŕuwe-ray ŕuwe ŕuwa ŕuwa - 3. yéél yeluu-w yelú-ray  -yelú  -yelú  -yelú  -yelú - 4. fáán f-oow fa-ray fó-ór -fé  -faa  -faa  -fa - 5. liim lim-oow lim-man  -lif  -lime -lif  -limaa  -lima - 6. woon won-oow wono-man  -wono  -wono  -wonaa  -wona - 7. fúús féh-úúw fúú-man  -fúú  -fúú  -fúú  -fúú - 8. wall wal-uuw walú-man  -wale  -walu walú  -walu - 9. ttiw ttiw- oow ttiwa-man  -ttiwa  -ttiwa  -ttiwaa  -ttiwa - how many? fit-oow fite-ray  -fite  -fite  -fitaa  -fitaa } Sequential counting is used for rapid counting and can be combined in order to count two or three numbers without intervention. For example, \\"one, two\\" can be counted as yét-é-ŕúúw and \\"three, four\\" as yei-u-fáán. This sequential counting can be used as a system for rapid pair counting of objects such as coconuts and breadfruit. The general suffixes are used for objects that do not have a specified suffix. Suffixes for objects are either drawn upon from the general set or any of the other sets. The animate suffixes are applied to humans, animals, weapons, tools, musical instruments, and other miscellaneous artifacts. The animate suffixes are the only ones to have two different classifiers: -ray and -man with -man being the Trukese cognate for -mén. Long object suffixes are used for objects that are long and slender such as rope (yámeey), vehicles (citosa), and cigarettes (suupwa). Round objects suffixes are used for round objects such as stones (fawú), breadfruit (mááy), eggs (hakúll). Flat object suffixes are applied to objects such as leaves (éé), clothes (Mégaak: cloth), and mat (hááki). Ordinals follow the pattern of sequential counting with the prefixes /ya-/, /yó-/, or /yé-/, followed by the base number, and the suffix /an-/ as seen in the following table. {  1st ya-ye-w-an - 2nd yó-ŕuw-ow-an - 3rd yé-yelú-w-an - 4th yó-f-ow-an - 5th Yá-lim- ow-an - 6th yó-won-ow-an - 7th ya-féh-úw-an - 8th ya-wal-uw-an - 9th ya-ttiw-ow-an - 10th ya-hee-yik-an } The names of the days of the week for Tuesday through Saturday are the ordinals from 2nd through 6th without the suffix /an-/. Monday is sometimes referred to as ya-ye-w (1st) and Sunday ya-féh-úw (7th), but more commonly known as, hárin fáál (ending sacredness) and ránini pin (sacred day). However, Trukese words for the names of the week are more often heard but with a Puluwat accent. {  + Monday seŕin fáán - Tuesday yóŕuuw - Wednesday yewúnúngat - Thursday yeŕuuwanú - Friday yelimu - Saturday yommol } ==NotesReferences== * * * == External links == * Puluwatese lexical database with English glosses archived with Kaipuleohone Category:Chuukic languages Category:Endangered Austronesian languages Category:Languages of the Federated States of Micronesia ","title":"Puluwat language"},{"id":"35898373","text":"Nikolay Anatolyevich Nikiforov (; born 24 June 1982) is a Russian politician. In 2012, he became Minister of Communications and Mass Media of Russia. ==Career== At age 19, Nikiforov became deputy director of the Kazan Portal company. From 2006 to 2010, he headed the Center of Information Technology of Tatarstan. In 2010, Nikiforov became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Information and Communication of the Tatarstan Republic. On 21 May 2012, at the age of 29, he was named as the Minister of Communications and Mass Media in Dmitry Medvedev's Cabinet, thus becoming its youngest member. In October 2012, Nikiforov criticized Russia's leading telecom operation, Rostelecom for failing to address \\"digital inequality\\" in the country. Nikiforov singled out Rostelecom's investment strategy, which has primarily focused on expanding its market share by acquiring other companies, as inadequate. This, Nikiforov said, means the company's energies are focused on areas that are already connected to the internet, rather than acting to expand internet access. He pursued the modernization of the Russian Post, saying that modernization of the Russian Post will make it possible to deliver mail inside the country within a week. Nikiforov said the purpose of the Ministry of Communications is to ensure that all mail should be delivered within the boundaries of one large city of community within one day and that he sees several instruments of financing the postal service’s upgrade program, such as the issue of infrastructure bonds, a rise in the prices of some services, the introduction of differentiated fees for the delivery of pensions (depending on the region) and the introduction of tax breaks. Since 27 December 2017, he is on the supervisory board of Post Bank. Nikiforov was responsible for the transition away from Apple iOS products towards Samsung Android products for use as government IT tools sometime between 2010 and March 2014, when it was first noticed by journalists at a cabinet meeting. He was quoted by AFP as saying \\"American special services … will significantly increase the volume of information they intercept (which) of course causes serious concern to many governmental clients. This obviously orientates Russian clients, primarily state ones, to be very choosy about their partners in IT.\\" ==Accusations of academic dishonesty== In 2011, Nikiforov defended his thesis in Economics. According to an examination by Dissernet, this doctoral thesis contains at least 97 pages with undocumented plagiarism from six other works and data fabrication. On 22 June 2016, the dissertation council of the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration confirmed the existence of plagiarism in Nikiforov's thesis, but refused to recommend stripping Nikiforov of his degree. ==References== Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century Russian politicians Category:Government ministers of Russia Category:Kazan Federal University alumni Category:People from Kazan Category:People involved in plagiarism controversies Category:Russian economists Category:United Russia politicians ","title":"Nikolay Nikiforov"},{"id":"35898383","text":"Rosemary Clement-Moore is an American author.

Aside from the FEARnet cable television network, the show is also offered to watch on outlets such as Hulu, iTunes, and FEARnet On-Demand. == Premise == Set in the small New England town of Holliston, Massachusetts, the series stars creator/writer/director/executive producer/showrunner Adam Green as \\"Adam\\" and executive producer Joe Lynch as \\"Joe\\", who are college grads that are chasing their dream to become horror filmmakers, whilst not quite making ends meet working at a local cable access station. The main ensemble is rounded out by Laura Ortiz (who plays \\"Laura\\", Joe's bubbly yet artistically morbid girlfriend) and Corri English (who plays \\"Corri\\", Adam's ex-girlfriend and childhood sweetheart that he is constantly trying to win back). The show regularly features Twisted Sister's Dee Snider as Adam and Joe's cross-dressing, glam rock loving boss \\"Lance Rockett\\" and Oderus Urungus (Dave Brockie) of Gwar as \\"Oderus\\", Adam's imaginary alien friend who lives in his closet. == Cast and characters == * Adam Green as Adam * Joe Lynch as Joe * Laura Ortiz as Laura * Corri English as Corri * Dee Snider as Lance Rockett * Dave Brockie as Oderus Urungus == Critical reception == Dread Central said \\"Season Two of “Holliston” is a quantum leap forward for a show that was already very, very good.\\" Tyler Doupe of Comingsoon.net said \\"Holliston has a ton of heart. It will appeal to horror fans because it is made by horror fans for horror fans.\\" The Austin Chronicle described the show as \\"The result is half Sabrina, The Teenage Witch, half Monty Python...Think of it as the show you hoped The Big Bang Theory would be.\\" On the other hand, Nick Venable of Cinema Blend panned the show calling it a \\"shitty sitcom\\" and \\"On paper, you could say it’s The League meets Spaced. But then you realize you’re holding toilet paper, and these are the smeared crayon ramblings of a child. \\" Ken Hanley of Fangoria gave it two out of four skulls saying \\"while the show brazenly attempts to relate to the horror crowd while incorporating atypical elements of a sitcom, the success rate is a mixed bag, as every fun moment of earned goofiness is quickly offset by a cheap, uninspired gag.\\" ==Production== The series is produced by Green's own production company 'ArieScope Pictures', in association with 'A Bigger Boat'. In Season 2, Supervising Producer Sean Becker was promoted to serve as director on many of the episodes in an effort to make Green's duties on the series more manageable. Composer Bear McCreary, who also writes the music for TV shows like The Walking Dead and Battlestar Galactica, provides the original score for Holliston. Shot in a multicamera format, the show uses a laugh track though Green has expressed interest to shoot in front of a live audience. On April 17, 2012, not long after the show's premiere, FEARnet announced that it had not only picked up Holliston for a second season scheduled for summer 2013, but also increased the episode order from 6 episodes to 10. In addition to the 10 episodes making up Season 2, a 1-Hour \\"Christmas Special\\" aired on December 18, 2012 serving as a bridge between Season's 1 and 2. Season 1 was released in the USA on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on October 9, 2012. The show has had guest stars such as comedian Seth Green, Tony Todd, Danielle Harris, Kane Hodder, Bailee Madison, director John Landis, Ray Wise, comedian Brian Posehn, Bill Moseley, Sid Haig, James Gunn and Derek Mears. The series began an extended hiatus at the end of 2013 as Adam Green and Joe Lynch went to work directing their next films (Digging Up The Marrow and Everly), Corri English gave birth to a baby boy, and the rest of the cast became busy with other film/TV projects and tours. Following the death of Dave Brockie and the closure of Fearnet, when and if the series would continue was unknown at the time. July 20, 2015, Entertainment Weekly reported that, per announcement by Adam Green and Joe Lynch on their The Movie Crypt podcast, Holliston would return for a third season in 2016 on GeekNation.http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/20/holliston-adam-green-joe- lynch-geeknation However, the third season was never aired. == Series overview == {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - ! style=\\"padding: 0 8px;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Season ! style=\\"padding: 0 8px;\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Episodes ! colspan=\\"2\\" Originally aired ! style=\\"padding: 0px 8px\\" colspan=\\"3\\"DVD and Blu-ray release dates - ! style=\\"padding: 0 8px;\\" Season premiere ! style=\\"padding: 0 8px;\\" Season finale ! style=\\"padding: 0px 8px\\" Region 1 ! style=\\"padding: 0px 8px\\" Region 2 ! style=\\"padding: 0px 8px\\" Region 4 -  000; height:10px;\\"  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 1  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 6  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" April 3, 2012  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" May 8, 2012  October 9, 2012   -  B30000; height:10px;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 2  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" 11  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" June 4, 2013  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" August 6, 2013  April 8, 2014   } ==EpisodesSeason 1 (2012)=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - ! style=\\"background-color: #000; color: #ffffff;\\" No. in series ! style=\\"background-color: #000; color: #ffffff;\\" No. in season ! style=\\"background-color: #000; color: #ffffff;\\" Title ! style=\\"background-color: #000; color: #ffffff;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background-color: #000; color: #ffffff;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background-color: #000; color: #ffffff;\\" Original air date - } ===Season 2 (2012–2013)=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - ! style=\\"background-color: #B30000; color: #ffffff;\\" No. in series ! style=\\"background-color: #B30000; color: #ffffff;\\" No. in season ! style=\\"background-color: #B30000; color: #ffffff;\\" Title ! style=\\"background-color: #B30000; color: #ffffff;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background-color: #B30000; color: #ffffff;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background-color: #B30000; color: #ffffff;\\" Original air date - } ==References== Category:2010s American horror television series Category:2012 American television series debuts Category:Television shows set in Massachusetts ","title":"Holliston (TV series)"},{"id":"35898391","text":"Satawalese is a Micronesian language of the Federated States of Micronesia. It is nearly intelligible with Mortlockese. ==IntroductionHistory=== Satawalese is a language spoken on the island of Satawal, located in the Federated States of Micronesia. The language is also spoken in Yap State, nearby atolls and islands such as Lamotrek, Woleai, Puluwat, Pulusuk, and Chuuk State. Smaller populations of speakers can also be found in Saipan, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and some parts of the United States. According to a 1987 census, Satawalese is spoken by approximately 460 people however this number has grown, according to a count taken by researcher Kevin Roddy who reported for about 700 speakers in 2007. ===Classification=== Satawalese is identified as an Austronesian language and is a member of the Truukic language subgroup. Discovered by scholar Edward Quackenbush, the Truukic subgroup is a dialect chain composed of a variety of about 17 different languages and dialects extending 2,100 kilometers across the western Pacific (Roddy, 2007). This chain begins at Chuuk in the east and stretches towards Sonsorol in the west. In the center of this dialect continuum lies Satawalese. Using the comparative method, which involves the observation of vocabulary and sound correspondence similarities, linguists were able to link Satawalese as well as its sister languages to the Trukic language family. Sister languages of Satawalese include Carolinian, Chuukese, Mapia, Mortlockese, Namonuito, Paafang, Puluwatese, Sonsorol, Tanapag, Tobian, Ulithian, and Woleaian. ==SoundsConsonants=== Satawalese language contains 13 specific consonants. /p/, /f/, /m/, /w/, /n/, /t/, /s/, /r/, /j/, /k/, /t͡ʃ/, /ŋ/, /ɻ/ {class= style=text-align:center ! !Labial !Dental/ Alveolar !Post- alveolar !Dorsal - !Nasal   - !Occlusive  - !Fricative   - !Sonorant  } The existence of the phoneme is debated in Satawalese. Some scholars believe the phoneme to be an allophone of the phoneme . It is suggested that in Satawalese language both phonemes can be interchanged without changing the meaning of a word. Opposing studies suggest to be its own separate phoneme. Because of evidence that shows use of on its own within Satawalese speech, the suggestion that it is its own phoneme has a stronger stance. The phoneme in Satawalese has been identified as an allophone for the phoneme due to influence of surrounding languages. is not included in the Satawalese phoneme inventory but is a part of similar languages close in proximity. This phone is understood to convey the same meanings that phoneme will produce but in surrounding languages there are cases where roles cannot be reversed; will be able to take the place of but cannot take the place of . ===Vowels=== Satawalese contains nine vowels:/i/, /a/, /o/, /u/, /æ/, /ɛ/, /ʉ/, /ɞ/, /ɒ/. ==GrammarBasic word order=== Satawalese use Subject- Object-Verb word order. Ex: Mary a foato-ki tinikii we aan “Mary wrote her letter.” ===Reduplication=== Reduplication is available in the Satawalese language. It is used mainly to show a progressive form of a verb, noun, or adjective. Ex *‘’ras’’ vt. to pull something until it breaks. *‘’rasras’’ vt. progressive form of ras; the continuous pulling of something until it breaks *‘’rig’’ adj. small. *‘’rigrig’’ adj. progressive form of rig; smaller. *‘’seo’’ rested. *‘’seoseo’’ v. resting. *‘’pis’’ n. splash. *‘’pisipis’’ adj. progressive form of pis; 'splashing around'. ===Numerals=== Like most Pacific languages as well as many languages around the world, Satawalese takes advantage of a base ten counting system. The Satawalese language contains two basic counting systems (Roddy, 2007). One system is the fast version, which is the version used for counting objects as well as game playing. The second counting system in Satawal is the slow version. This system is used when teaching young children the numeral system, and is also used by older generations. Slow version Fast version English translation *‘’Eota’’ *‘’Eot’’ one *‘’Riuwa’’ *‘’Riuw’’ two *‘’Eoniu’’ *‘’Eon’’three *‘’Faeni’’ *‘’Faen’’four *‘’Nima’’ *‘’Nim’’five *‘’Wona’’ *‘’On’’ six *‘’Fiusa’’ *‘’Fius’’seven *‘’Waani’’ *‘’Wan’’ eight *‘’Tiwa*‘’Tiw’’nine Large numbers are also existent in the Satawalese language. All numbers greater than ten are produced by using the conjunction me, which translates to the word “and” in English. For example, the numeral eleven is seig me ew, which translates to “ten and one” in English or eleven. One billion is the largest numeral in the Satawalese language. It is expressed as engeras ssen or one thousand million. ==VocabularyIndigenous vocabulary=== *Saam –father *rheon –leaf *pwun –heart *oattoaur –to eat (polite form) *moat –to sit ===Loanwords=== Satawalese has borrowed words from major language countries that had traveled throughout the Pacific such as Japan, Spain, and the United States, as well as nearby languages within the Federated States of Micronesia, such as Woleaian and Ulithian. Words derived from English: *aispwoax – Ice box; refrigerator *felowa - bread; flour *finoras – flowers *frii – free *friiseor – freezer *karesiin – kerosene Words derived from Ulithian: *aasi – to take (it) *aaileng – world *fiifi – soup *kaerboaw – cow Words derived from Spanish: *floras – flowers *kanemasa – pumpkin Words derived from Japanese: *‘’kanepwas – calabash *kachito – movie Words derived from Woleaian: *gamaeinoak – pretend *faisun – as it is *\\" ngang\\"- Me *\\"Ito-come ==EndangermentMaterials=== Satawalese language resources have become quite abundant in the past decade. Alphabet books, translations, as well as dictionaries are all available in the Satawalese language. Also linguistic studies have been documented sharing the language’s grammar, phonology, vocabulary, stories, etc. ===Vitality=== According to endangeredlanguages.com Satawalese is classified as an endangered language. However, the language Satawalese shows much promise for the future. Satawalese is spoken as an L1 by most of the population occupying the island of Satawal. It is also used throughout the Federated States of Micronesia as well as nearby states. Also, according to David Roddy the population of Satawalese speakers has grown to 700 in an accounting taken in 2007. Awareness of the island has been a current enhancement to the language due to the contributions made of voyager Mau Piailug who was known to have been the first navigator aboard the ship of the infamous Hawaiian double-hulled canoe the Hokulea. With this discovery, interest in the island including the people, culture, and language have been uprooted, meaning more linguistic studies can be done, possibly more resources can be added, and so on. Finally, the Satawalese language documentation is outstanding. As stated before dictionaries and alphabet books have been created allowing the transmission of the language to occur between older and younger generations. ==Further reading== *The Navigator's Of Satawal, Mau Piailug's Star Compass.mpg. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpX04U9FvTU. *Roddy, Kevin M.

He was educated at the grammar school there under Joseph Romney. In 1787 he entered Daventry Academy as a student for the nonconformist ministry, and in 1789 the academy moved to Northampton, where John Horsey was principal. After he had spent a short time at Bruges as tutor to an English family, the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792 compelled Stevenson to return to England, where he obtained the post of classical tutor at Manchester Academy. While at Manchester he became an Arian under the influence of Thomas Barnes. For a short time he preached at Dob Lane Chapel, Failsworth, where he was the successor of Lewis Loyd the banker. Stevenson resigned his posts and went as a pupil to a farmer in East Lothian. In 1797 he took a farm at Saughton, near Edinburgh. There he had James Cleghorn, a friend, as partner, but was less successful. After four or five years he gave up farming, and set up a boarding-house for students in Drummond Street, Edinburgh. In 1806 James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale invited Stevenson to accompany him to India as private secretary; Lauderdale's bid to become governor-general there then fell through, but he obtained for Stevenson the post of keeper of the records to the Treasury. Stevenson lived in the neighbourhood of London. Uglow identifies him, in the early 1820s, in the sketch from Recollections of Literary Characters of Katherine Thomson devoted to John Galt, as a taciturn man of letters who was a good listener. He died at his house at Chelsea, on 20 March 1829. ==Works== Generally Stevenson was a critic of the political economy of the period, finding it inconsistent and theoretical, lacking experimental foundation. He opposed the thinking of both Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo, against whom he brought up the \\"heterogeneous labour problem\\". William Blackwood published Stevenson in his magazine, but found his writing turgid. On economic matters, Blackwood's followed a High Tory line, exemplified by \\"Christopher North\\" (John Wilson) and David Robinson as well as John Galt and Stevenson. Stevenson was the author of: * Remarks on the very inferior Utility of Classical Learning, London, 1796. * A System of Land-Surveying, 1805; London, 1810. * General View of the Agriculture of the County of Surrey, London, 1809. * General View of the Agriculture of the County of Dorset, London, 1812. This work made extensive use of a survey carried out by Thomas Batchelor. * Historical Sketch of Discovery, Navigation, and Commerce, Edinburgh and London, 1824. This was taken to be a supplement to Robert Kerr's Voyages and Travels. Stevenson was editor of the Scots Magazine, to which he contributed essays. He also contributed to the Edinburgh Encyclopædia, wrote the life of William Caxton and other treatises for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, besides writing articles for the Edinburgh Review, the Retrospective Review, and other magazines, and compiling most of the Annual Register for several years. ==Family== Stevenson was twice married. By his first wife, Eliza Holland of Sandlebridge in Cheshire, he had two children, a son John and a daughter Elizabeth Cleghorn, who married William Gaskell, and became well known as the novelist Elizabeth Gaskell. Her middle name Cleghorn has often been traced to James Cleghorn; Chapple argues in favour of Robert Cleghorn, friend of Robert Burns, via his wife, also associated with Saughton. Eliza Stevenson died in 1810, and in 1814 William married Catherine, daughter of Alexander Thomson of Savannah, Georgia. By her he had a son and daughter. ==References== ;Attribution ==External links== * * Category:1772 births Category:1829 deaths Category:Scottish writers ","title":"William Stevenson (Scottish writer)"},{"id":"35898469","text":"Complete Live at the Spotlite Club 1958 is a live album by American jazz pianist Ahmad Jamal featuring performances recorded at the Spotlight club in Washington D.C. in 1958, some of which were originally released on the albums Ahmad Jamal Trio Volume IV and Portfolio of Ahmad Jamal on the Argo label.Ahmad Jamal discography accessed May 22, 2012 == Reception == The Allmusic review awarded the album 5 stars stating \\"Best heard at sunset, late at night by candlelight, or in a cozy room softly illumined by indirect incandescence, this music offers the listener an opportunity to savor both what Jamal plays and what he doesn't play.

LTD, Huainan Media Industry Development Centre and Communication University of China. This 52-episode epic-historical-fantasy series is based on Chinese philosophical classic Huainanzi and is broadcast by CCTV-Children. ==Synopsis== During the ancient Western Han dynasty (206BC-9AD), a series of disasters caused by occult phenomena swept across the entire world. Huainanzi, the mysterious Chinese book bound in bamboo, was ripped apart and sent through time to different historical junctures. The book pieces were transformed into various objects, waiting to be rediscovered. A hundred years later, a young man, named Hong Lie lifts up the burden to collect the missing pieces of the ancient bamboo book. With the help of Ba Gong and his friends, going through the Gate of 24 Solar Terms, Hong Lie travels through dynasties to search for the lost pieces. In his adventure, Hong Lie and his loyal friends, Ji Ming and Gou Tiao, together experienced the greatness of the ancient legends, appreciating the wisdom of the ancestors from Chun Qiu Period, and witnessed all the weird things happening among ordinary people. Warmth and coldness, sadness and happiness, separation and reunion, stories led him to the great world in the book Huainanzi and through exciting adventures he made lifelong friends. In this special way, Hong Lie communicated with ancestors and started to see the principle of world, realizing that obeying the laws of nature and being in harmony with the environment was the right thing to do. A simple collecting journey slowly became a challenging trip for him to go on with his family mission, and inherit the ancestor's spirit. ==Main Character== Hong Lie A 12-year-old naughty boy, with a direct and straight character, he is a big fan of playing tricks, but inside him is kind and faithful soul. He has a strong sense of justice, when unfair things occur, he would definitely fight against them. As long as he made up his mind on something, no one or nothing could ever stop him. Since he never cares for the consequences, most goodies would be turned into disasters because of him, and often the situation would fall out of control. Li Qi A 15-year-old pretty girl, innocent and romantic, she is the real first-chair in the family, doing all the chores and maintaining the daily order. She also needs to take care of Ba Gong and educate her younger brother. She is always gentle and nice to other people, however when it comes to her naughty brother Hong Lie, she would go crazy, and of course, two of them are always fighting. Ba Gong He is a weird old man of over an hundred years old, moody and unpredictable, he is always absorbed in his own thoughts. He loves to play small tricks, and doing unexpected things, people are already used to his craziness. He never seems to worry about Hong Lie or Li Qi at all, he lets them do whatever they want, and treats them like friends. He believes that everyone has their own destiny and as long as one can enjoy his life, that's fine. However, if anything relates to the bamboo book happens, he would take it very serious and suddenly become another man. Ji Ming He was once a fighting rooster of the royal court, then went to heaven with Liu An and was known as the Vermilion Bird. However, after that he got banished to the man's world and ever since then he became an ordinary rooster. He can't stand the mocking of fate and swears to go back to heaven. Therefore, he's always so eager about travelling back through time, and for this reason, he is sometimes way too utilitarian and selfish. He's quite clever, and the thing he hates the most is being treated as an ordinary rooster. Gou Tiao He loves to sleep, loves to droll, and rarely talks, but when he starts to say something in that fairly slow speed, those simple words always reveals the reality and the truth. Usually he seems to be lazy and casual, nothing could ever surprise him. However, when trapped in dangerous situations, he would become ferocious in a second and get ready to fight. Once the alert canceled, he would go back to that sleepy face again. In addition, his loyalty to Hong Lie cannot be doubted. == References == Category:Chinese children's animated fantasy television series ","title":"The Legend of Huainanzi"},{"id":"35898499","text":"Nemophora chionites is a moth of the family Adelidae or fairy longhorn moths.

The common name for this and the other New Zealand species of Coriaria is tutu. Coriaria arborea is found in scrub and open areas from the coast to the hills across the country. A straggling plant, it can grow to 20 ft high. The leaves grow opposite on slender stems while flowers are arranged in drooping racemes. C. arborea is capable of nitrogen fixation. == Ecology == C. arborea plays host to several species of New Zealand endemic moth including Izatha austera, I. churtoni, I. mesoschista and I. peroneanella. == Uses == In spite of its toxicity, Tutu was consumed by Māori, specifically the extracted juice from the fleshy flower petals. The gathered berries were placed in specially woven baskets lined with the flower heads of Toetoe, acting as a sieve to separate the poisonous seeds from the squeezed juice. The extracted juice is used as a sweetener to foods such as fernroot or was boiled together with seaweed and left to set as a black jelly called Rehia. == Toxicity == The toxin tutin is found in all parts of the plant apart from the fleshy flower petals. Tutu has been responsible for the most cases of livestock poisoning by any New Zealand plant. Dogs and even two circus elephants have been poisoned by the plant. On occasion human poisoning has occurred through consuming honey where bees had interacted with the plant. In 2014, a man tramping in Auckland, New Zealand looking to try the taste of the plant supplejack, mistakenly attempted to eat an asparagus-looking young shoot of tutu. He said he did not actually eat any of the plant because of the revolting taste, but within hours he was having a tonic-clonic seizure that dislocated his arm, induced convulsions and made breathing difficult. Academic experts concluded he was lucky to survive the poisoning. A year later he had recovered fully apart from having some trouble with his memory. Honey becomes contaminated when bees collect honeydew secreted by the passionvine hopper insect that feeds off the tutu plant. People have occasionally been hospitalised or even killed by honey contaminated with tutin. 1974 was the last case of commercial honey poisoning where 13 people were poisoned. Since 1974 there have been nine other cases of honey poisoning, with the most recent occurring in 1991 in the Bay of Plenty and 2008 in the Coromandel. Periods of drought increase the risk of poisoning.

The lawsuit concerned an injunction sought by multiple Afghan asylum seekers against immigration minister Chris Bowen. The injunction was to prevent Bowen from deporting the plaintiffs to Malaysia, pursuant to s198A of the Migration Act (a provision since repealed). The purpose of the deportation was to avoid their asylum application from being assessed by Australia. The court decided that the Commonwealth government did not have lawful authority to force resettlement of the plaintiffs to Malaysia. The Migration Act's s198A deportation power required a declaration be first made by the Minister about the recipient country's refugee protections; and it was found this declaration had been made invalidly. A majority found that Malaysia was unable to be declared a safe country for asylum seekers pursuant to s198A, due to Malaysia not being bound to protect refugees either at domestic or international law. As Bowen's declaration was legally invalid, it followed he lacked power to order their deportation. The case is notable in Australian Administrative Law for the High Court's comments about jurisdictional fact, error, and statutory interpretation. It is also of historic importance to Australian refugee jurisprudence. Politically, the case was a major defeat for the Gillard Labor government. It had the effect of dismantling the 'Malaysian solution', an important plank within the government's policy toward asylum seekers. It was also a major political and diplomatic embarrassment for the government. A year after the decision, the Gillard Labor Government passed legislation re- establishing offshore processing centres on Nauru and in Papua New Guinea. ==Facts== Christmas Island immigration detention centre The plaintiffs had traveled from Afghanistan to Christmas Island. M70 was an adult, and M106 was an unaccompanied minor. As the plaintiffs had arrived without visas, they held the legal status as 'unlawful non-citizens' due to the Migration Act. Christmas Island had special legal status from the act as an 'excised offshore place'. Therefore the plaintiffs were additionally assigned the status of being 'offshore entry persons' by the act; as a consequences of them having entered Australia at Christmas Island whilst being unlawful non-citizens. This enabled an immigration official to exercise a discretion to detain the plaintiffs under s189(3) of the act. As people assigned 'offshore entry person' status, neither plaintiff was allowed to apply for a visa except at the discretion of the Minister. He didn't consider granting that permission. Neither was he obliged to. In July 2011 the Commonwealth made an arrangement with the Malaysian government. The terms of the arrangement were that the Commonwealth would transfer 800 asylum seekers whom had irregularly arrived by sea to Malaysia, where their claims for refugee protection would be carried out by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. In return Australia would accept from Malaysia 4,000 refugees for domestic resettlement. s198(2) of the act imposed a duty on officers to remove those subject to s189(3) detention as soon as possible. Section 198A granted a power to deport 'offshore entry persons', conditional on a declaration being first made about the recipient country under subsection s198A(3). That section enabling the declaration read: > 'The Minister may: (a) declare in writing that a specified country: (i) > provides access, for persons seeking asylum, to effective procedures for > assessing their need for protection; and (ii) provides protection for > persons seeking asylum, pending determination of their refugee status; and > (iii) provides protection to persons who are given refugee status, pending > their voluntary repatriation to their country of origin or resettlement in > another country; and (iv) meets relevant human rights standards in providing > that protection;' On 25 July 2011, the Minister had used the section to make a declaration that Malaysia was such a country. In August 2011, an immigration officer determined that M70 would be removed from Australia pursuant to the arrangement, while M106 would be removed once support services for unaccompanied minors had been established. Neither plaintiff would go to Malaysia voluntarily. The plaintiffs invoked the High Court's original jurisdiction to seek an injunction against the Commonwealth, to restrain it from deporting them to Malaysia. Their arguments were that: # The only source of power to take them from Australia was s198A of the Act; # That power is conditioned upon a valid declaration having been made under s198A(3) of the Act; # The declaration about Malaysia made on 25 July 2011 was not validly made because the four criteria were jurisdictional facts which did not exist; or alternatively, that they were facts of which the Minister had to be satisfied of before making a declaration, and he was not satisfied because he had misconstrued the criteria. The Commonwealth's case was that the s198A(3) criteria were not requisite facts. Instead, it claimed the Minister was merely required to form, in good faith, an evaluation of Malaysia that he could then declare to be true. ==Judgment Gummow, Hayne, Crennan & Bell JJ === The majority accepted the plaintiff's construction of the act, finding that s198A(3) required certain jurisdictional facts to be established. It was not enough for the Minister to have a good faith subjective opinion about the criteria. They found that access and protections to which the s198A(3)(i) - (iii) criteria referred; 'needed to be provided as a matter of legal obligation'. Further, they were understood to refer to access and protections mirroring those that Australia had undertaken by signing onto the Refugees Convention and Refugees Protocol. With respect to s198A(3)(i); It was not enough for Malaysia to have allowed the UNHCR to undertake refugee protection assessment procedures; without providing for those procedures at domestic law or being bound at international law to do so. Similarly, Malaysia could not be found to provide protections of the kind described in (ii) or (iii) unless its domestic law expressly dealt with refugees, or was internationally obliged to protect refugees. Australia's arrangement with Malaysia didn't oblige Malaysia at international law to provide any of those rights, (as it was not a treaty) and additionally there wasn't even a provision within the arrangement ensuring that those rights would be provided. In summation the majority wrote: > 'As already explained, the references in s 198A(3)(a) to a country that > provides access and provides protection are to be construed as references to > provision of access or protection in accordance with an obligation to do so. > Where, as in the present case, it is agreed that Malaysia: first, does not > recognise the status of refugee in its domestic law and does not undertake > any activities related to the reception, registration, documentation and > status determination of asylum seekers and refugees; second, is not party to > the Refugees Convention or the Refugees Protocol; and, third, has made no > legally binding arrangement with Australia obliging it to accord the > protections required by those instruments; it was not open to the Minister > to conclude that Malaysia provides the access or protections referred to in > s 198A(3)(a)(i) to (iii). The Minister's conclusions that persons seeking > asylum have access to UNHCR procedures for assessing their need for > protection and that neither persons seeking asylum nor persons who are given > refugee status are ill-treated pending determination of their refugee status > or repatriation or resettlement did not form a sufficient basis for making > the declaration. The jurisdictional facts necessary to making a valid > declaration under s 198A(3)(a) were not and could not be established.' - > Gummow, Hayne, Crennan & Bell JJ With respect to plaintiff M106, the majority found that his deportation was additionally prevented by the 'IGOC Act'; as it restrained his deportation unless prior written consent was first obtained from his guardian, the minister. Consent had not been provided. === Chief Justice French === Chief Justice French differed in his construction of the act from the majority, in that he did not accept the plaintiff's statutory construction that the section required the establishment of certain jurisdictional facts. Rather, the decision maker's evaluative judgement was itself the jurisdictional fact. However, a mandatory consideration for that evaluation, was the domestic law of the proposed receiving country and its binding commitments under international law. This evaluation was required to be done with respect to the section's four criteria, as they ought be properly understood. He then found that in making his declaration, the Minister was obligation to consider the domestic laws of the specified country, and the international laws to which it had bound itself. French CJ found that the words used in the act's criteria such as 'provides access ... to effective procedures', 'protection', and 'relevant human rights standards', were indicative of a requirement to assess the country's relevant laws. It was then found that based upon the information upon which the Minister had acted, and on his affidavit; it was clear that he did not look to Malaysia's legal obligations either domestically, or internationally; as a basis for his declaration. No evidence was provided showing that the Minister had paid attention to the legal fragility of an 'exemption order' under the Malaysian Immigration Act, or to other associated legal risks to transferees. Instead, his decision had been informed by conversations with his Malaysian ministerial counterpart, and observations by DFAT about contemporary practices of Malaysia toward asylum seekers. For that reason French CJ found the Minister's s198A(3) declaration was tainted by jurisdictional error, and therefore found invalid. As the declaration was invalid, no power existed for the Commonwealth to deport the plaintiffs to Malaysia via s198A(1). Nor would it be possible for the plaintiffs to be removed to Malaysia under s198(2), without an officer first making an assessment as to whether the person was someone to whom Australia owed protection obligations. === Justice Kiefel === Like the majority, Kiefel J found that s198A(3)(a) had the effect of shifting some of Australia's responsibilities under the refugee convention to another country. She found its 'evident concern' was that Australia's obligations under the convention were not breached in that process. Further, she found that s198A(3)(a)(i) referred to a country that recognized the status of refugees; and didn't merely require that the country ensure that an asylum-seeker have access to an assessment of refugee status by an NGO. That requirement had the consequence of implying that the country recognises the status of refugees and gives effect to the convention. Kiefel found that such recognition and protection is put into effect by laws, and so the minister's decision was to be made with reference to those laws. A practical assessment of a country's practices regarding refugees, could not replace the requirement that the country oblige itself through law, to provide necessary recognition and protection; in order to be subject to the act's declaration. As Malaysia did not have laws recognizing and protecting refugees from refoulment and persecution, the facts necessary for making a declaration under s198A(3)(a) did not exist, and the declaration found invalid. Kiefel found additionally that the Minister had misunderstood the nature of the inquiry posed by s198A(3)(a), and therefore had made the decision in jurisdictional error. That being the case, it followed there was no power to remove the plaintiffs to Malaysia. === Justice Heydon (dissent) === Heydon J found that the s198A(3)(a) was limited to practical conditions in Malaysia, not matters of legal obligation. With regard to the IGOC Act constraining M106's deportation; Heydon found that the act did not require written consent. He further found that he had 'shown by his conduct that he consents to the taking of the second plaintiff from Australia ... it is clear that the Minister most strongly consents to the second plaintiff's departure, and to speak in that fashion is to speak euphemistically.' For these reasons among others, Heydon supported the dismissal of both appeals. ==Aftermath== Immigration Minister Chris Bowen, speaking in August 2011 The minister Chris Bowen described the decision as 'profoundly disappointing'. He defended the Government's construction of the Immigration Act, saying that the High Court had 'applied a new test to how protections should be demonstrated'. The result effectively sunk Labor's 'Malaysian solution' scheme, as no valid declaration could be made unless Malaysia would first sign up to the UN Refugee Convention; and there was no prospect of that happening at the time. Legislative amendment was not an option to rescue the scheme, as a government attempt to remove the Migration Act's s198A(3) constraints (replacing it with a sole 'national interest' criterion for a declaration) failed to pass the lower house. That amendment also sought to override the IGOC Act protection that had been found applicable to the unaccompanied minor, M106. The Greens at the time held the balance of power in the lower house. Controversially, Prime Minister Julia Gillard commented on the decision by saying that the High Court had 'missed an opportunity' in its rejection of the deal. The PM also accused Chief Justice French of having made a ruling inconsistent with his prior judgements. She was criticised for those comments by the Law Council. It released a written statement that read 'it is highly inappropriate to single-out the chief justice for particular criticism ... his honour was one of six judges in the majority and the legal principles established by the case are very clear.' Professor George Williams defended Gillard as having a right to respond to the written judgement, characterizing her comments as those of a 'disappointed litigant'. The decision was praised by both the Liberal Party as well as the Australian Greens. The opposition shadow immigration minister at the time, Scott Morrison, described the judgement as 'another policy failure by an incompetent government' he added; > 'I've been to Malaysia ... It was clear to me that the protections the > Minister boldly claimed existed, simply didn't exist. ... He's been found > out by the High Court, and as a result the Government's asylum and border > policy is a complete and utter mess.' Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said that the decision had vindicated her party's position on the deal. There isn't any publicly available information as to the plaintiff's reaction to the decision, although 'clapping and cheering' was heard from inside the detention center following the result according to ABC News journalist Jane Norman. Matthew Albert, the lead counsel for the plaintiff was asked at an LIV forum what would happen following the decision. He spoke of the 'sombre' task he had of telling his clients that whilst they would not be deported to Malaysia; they would remain indefinitely detained and be at the mercy of the Government. What eventually happened of the persons M70 and M106 is unknown to the general public. alt= Julian Burnside QC (also at the LIV forum) remarked of the decision by saying it was 'safe to say that offshore processing is no longer an option for the Government'. In actuality, the Gillard Labor government responded the following year by reopening Manus island offshore detention facilities. This was in spite of those facilities being only recently shut down by the first Rudd Government in 2008. These facilities were kept open after Rudd regained the office of Prime Minister from Gillard; and the Manus facility became a part of what was referred to as the 'PNG solution'. I.e. Labor's stated policy of preventing any asylum seeker arriving in Australia by boat from ever being domestically settled as refugees. Genuine refugees would be offered asylum in Papua New Guinea, whilst non-genuine asylum seekers would be repatriated, moved to a third country, or remain in indefinite detention. That policy was maintained by the subsequent Coalition Government, and as of 2020 indefinite offshore detention at Manus Island remains as Australian Government policy. The president of the Malaysian Bar association welcomed the decision, writing in a statement that it was a 'reminder to Malaysia of the importance of being a signatory to the Refugee convention and its protocol'. ==Notes See Also == * PNG Solution * Christmas Island Detention Centre * Jurisdictional error Category:Australian migration law Category:High Court of Australia cases Category:2011 in case law Category:2011 in Australian law ","title":"Plaintiff M70 v Minister for Immigration"},{"id":"35898539","text":"Tony Miller (born March 15, 1969) is an American former sprinter.

Since Lavongai is an Austronesian language, it follows several of the unique characteristics of these groups of language. Several examples is the specific form for the singular, dual, trial and plural tense, the clarity of knowing if the person spoken to is included or excluded in the dual, trial and plural tenses, and the defining of the possessive tense expressed by an ending added to the noun. However, unlike the languages spoken in Papua New Guinea, it has not adopted and mixed with other languages. It is spoken on the island of New Hanover and its neighboring islands. There are different dialects of the Lavongai language. The major difference between the language dialects is between the villages of the south coast and the villages from the western tip to the islands on the north coast. There are also smaller differences between villages, but it does not have a major effect on the communication between these villages. Its endangered level (according to Ethnalogue) is 5, which means it is a language used frequently, so there is no fear that it will be endangered, but is not considered the main language of New Guinea. ==Phonology== Phoneme inventory of the Tungag language:Karin E.

These letters are ʌ, a, b, d, e, f, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, ŋ, o, p, r, s, t, u, v. === Vowels === In the Lavongai language, there are six vowels: a, e, i, o, u, ʌ. The /ʌ/ is pronounced as the /uh/ in butter. The other vowels: /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/ are pronounced the same as their pronunciation in the Latin language. Thus they all can be pronounced as a long vowel or a short vowel. However, the /i/ retains its /i/ sound unlike the Latin language, in which the /i/ is pronounced as /y/ if the 'i' is behind another vowel. === Consonants === In the Lavongai language, there are 15 consonants: b, d, f, g, h, k, l, m, n, ŋ, p, r, s, t, v.  Many consonants can be replaced/deleted  = 'f' and 'p' = However to some, 'f' and 'h' are considered letters in the alphabet, but others do not. For the letter 'f', it can usually be replaced by the letter 'p'. * kafil/ kapil - the headgear of the women * difil/ dipil - to come back from fishing without result While there are some cases where 'p' cannot replace 'f', the number of cases is very small. * * tapak cannot become tafak ** tafak - lightning ** tapak - leprosy = 'b' and 'v' = For the letter 'b', it can be replaced by 'v' * beŋebeŋe/veŋeveŋe - the hornbill * bil/vil - to do, the deed * bis/vis - to fight, the fight = 'r' and 'd' = For the letter 'r', it can be replaced by 'd' * rauŋ/dauŋ - to kill, the killing * ororuŋ/oroduŋ - to dream, the dream * rokot/dokot - stick fast * ruduai/duduai - to meet = 'h' = For the letter 'h', unlike like the above letters , the letter 'h' is normally dropped. Dropping the letter 'h' in a word does not change the meaning at all. * hat/ at - stone * hainʌ/ ainʌ - woman/female * his/ is - nose === Diphthongs === In the Lavongai language, there are 7 diphthongs: /au/, /oi/, /ai/, /ei/, /ao/, /eu/, and /ua/. The diphthongs /au/, /oi/, /ai/ have the same pronunciation as \\"how\\", \\"high\\", and \\"boy\\" from the English language. However,the other diphthongs do not have a perfect sound.  /au/  Regarding the diphthong /au/, it can sometimes replace the vowel 'a' if it is a three letter word and between two consonants and vice versa. This practice is more common in the dialects spoken on the north coast. * sap may be changed into saup - to beat * ŋat may be changed into ŋaut - cut grass * tan may be changed into taun* - the day * ŋanvak may be changed into ŋanwauk - the morning * ilesvak may be changed into ilesvauk - tomorrow However this replacement can not be done to every word. Listed below are some of the words that can not have use the 'a'/'au' replacement. * vap - \\"people\\" * nat - \\"son\\" * mat - \\"dead\\" * taun* - \\"to cook\\" Note: taun has two meanings: \\"the day\\" or \\"to cook\\".  /ua/  Regarding the diphthong /ua/, it can sometimes be replaced with vowels 'o' or 'a'. * a pua nat / a po nat - \\"the boys\\" * a pua aina / a pa aina - \\"the women\\" * a veua / a veo - \\"the shark\\"  /ai/ and /ei/  Regarding the diphthongs /ai/ and /ei/, they can be exchanged with other. * nei / nai - in, the inner part, the intestines * vei / vai - not, lest * veiniŋ / vainiŋ == Grammar  Nouns ===  Proper nouns and mass nouns  These nouns are nouns that can not be marked with a possession mark, nor can be counted. * kʌ-g Kerek - my Kerek (Kerek is a name) * lamʌn - water  Alienable and inalienably possessed nouns  Alienable nouns are nouns that have a possessive pronoun preceding the noun * kʌ-mem ŋono posong - our two names * kʌ-g aina - my wife Inalienable nouns are nouns that use a suffix to express possessive. * pukun-ina - its body * ŋur- uria - their mouths === Counting numbers === When counting from one to 10, the Lavongai language counts based on groups of fives and tens.  1 - 4  The numerals 1 through 4 are mono-morphemic words. * sikei - one * ponguʌ - two * potol - three * puat - four  5  The numeral 5 is distinct with its two morpheme composition. * pal-pal lima - five  6 - 9  The numerals 6 through 9 are based on adding either 1 - 4 with the numeral 5. * lima-le-sikei - five-from-one / six The words for 2 - 4 can be shortened by omitting the first syllable and changing 'o' to 'u'. * puat → -at * ponguʌ → -nguʌ * potol → -tul * lima-le-at - five-from-four / nine  10  Likewise to the numeral 5, the numeral 10 also has a distinct two morpheme composition. * sikei a sangauli - te === Sentence structure === The Lavongai language follows the SVO (subject-verb-object) structure. {  !Sentence Structure for Different Types of Sentences - !Intransitive clause - Subject / Verb Phrase / Adjunct - !Transitive clause (1 complement) - Subject / Verb Phrase / Direct Object / Adjunct - !Transitive clause (2 complements) - Subject / Verb Phrase / Direct Object / Indirect Object /Adjunct - !Transitive clause, speech and perception verbs (2 complements) - Subject / Verb Phrase / Direct Object / _ta_ / Indirect Object / Adjunct - !Negation on the Sentence level - Subject / _parik_ / _pa_ Verb Phrase / adjunct - !Prohibition (Negative Imperative) - Subject / _ago ta_ / Verb Phrase / Adjunct / _-an_ / Direct Object - !Coordinate Conjunction - Verb Phrase / Coordinating Conjunction / Verb Phrase - !Subordinate Conjunction - Verb Phrase / Subordinate Conjunction / Verb Phrase - !Fronted Object - Direct Object / Subject / Verb Phrase / Trace Object / Indirect Object / Adjunct - !Fronted Verb Phrase - Verb Phrase / Subject } == References == Category:Meso-Melanesian languages Category:Languages of New Ireland Province ","title":"Tungag language"},{"id":"35898582","text":"Qarsita () is a Sunni Muslim village located in the highest mountains of Miniyeh-Danniyeh District in North Lebanon.

The dogs were released into a circular enclosure approximately 15m across, and mounted archers would fire upon them whilst riding around the perimeter. Originally intended as a military training exercise, dog-shooting became popular as a sport among the Japanese nobility during the Kamakura and Muromachi periods (1185-1573). During this time it was briefly banned during the rule of Emperor Go-Daigo (owing to his concern for the dogs); however, this ruling was overturned by the shōgun Ashikaga Takauji at the behest of his archery teacher Ogasawara Sadamune. The influential Ogasawara family were particular adherents of inuoumono; Sadamune's archery treatise Inuoumono mikuanbumi regarded it as fundamental to a warrior's training, and his great- grandson Mochinaga devoted five books to the subject. The arrows used in dog- shooting were usually rendered non-fatal, by being either padded or blunted. This modification to the original sport was suggested by the Buddhist clergy, as a way of preventing injury to the dogs used. Inuoumono waned in popularity during the sixteenth century and has been largely extinct as a practice since then. It was eventually banned outright during the reign of Tokugawa Iemochi. Occasional revivals have taken place: there is a record of the shōgun Tokugawa Ieyoshi viewing dog-shooting in 1842, and the sport was performed for Ulysses S. Grant during an official visit to Japan in 1879 (Grant reportedly expressed distaste for the practice). The last recorded instance of dog-shooting took place before the Meiji Emperor in 1881. ==See also== * Yabusame * Kasagake ==References== Category:Japanese archery ","title":"Inuoumono"},{"id":"35898775","text":"Ahmad Jamal Plays is an album by American jazz pianist Ahmad Jamal featuring performances recorded in 1955 and originally released on the short-lived Parrot label in 1955.Büttner, A., Campbell, R., & Pruter, R.

It is located in Rexburg, Idaho, near Yellowstone National Park. It was established in 1998. The park holds over 8 species of wildlife indigenous to the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Other attractions in the park include a small amusement park and a petting zoo. Yellowstone Bear World is the only wildlife park in the United States where guests can bottle feed bear cubs. == History Construction Delays=== During construction of the park, developer Mike Ferguson halted excavations after the Army Corps of Engineers told him they wanted him to stop due to controversy and the lack of a required permit for building in the Snake River wetland. Work was halted in late April-early May 1998, but by that point most of the work for the park was already completed. According to the terms of the Clean Water Act, developers are required to show that they will do no or little damage to wetlands before work is begun. There is no evidence that Ferguson knew that he needed such permits in advance of beginning development. On May 28, 1998, Madison County Commissioners voted to grant Mike Ferguson a permit to allow construction on the wetlands where the park was to be located. The vote was unanimous after local residents showed strong support for the project. This was the last step the park needed from county government officials for construction to be completed. On June 12, 1998, the first of Bear World's bears arrived, two days after Ferguson reached an agreement with Idaho wildlife officials who gave him permission to bring in the bears on a temporary basis. This move allowed Ferguson an opening to temporarily avoid a ban on the commercial importation of black bears. ===Direct Highway Access Closure=== In 2016, the Idaho Department of Transportation started construction on the Thornton Interchange on Highway 20. When the interchange was completed in early 2017, it closed off the direct access to Yellowstone Bear World from Highway 20. Now visitors must follow signs, taking a less convenient route though backroads. According to Courtney Ferguson (general manager of Bear World) the closure of the direct highway access resulted in a 10% drop in business. A frontage road was later constructed to the west of Highway 20 to reinstate direct access. The road opened on May 30, 2019. ==AttractionsDrive-Thru=== Yellowstone Bear World is the only drive- through wildlife reserve in the Greater Yellowstone area. The major cause of attraction of the park is the opportunity for visitors to see grizzly bears, black bears, and other wildlife indigenous to North America in their native habitat and from the safety and comfort of their cars. Bottle feeding a bear cub in Yellowstone Bear World 2003. ===Bottle Feeding Bear Cubs=== Three times during each day the park offers children and adults the chance to bottle feed bear cubs and pet them. The feeding experience is part of a complete 'behind the scenes' visit with a professional animal keeper. ===Wildlife Excursion=== The Wildlife Excursion is an attraction that is in addition to the admissions. An animal keeper takes adults and children on a large truck to feed and explain interesting facts about Rocky Mountain Elk, American Bison, Black Bears, and Grizzly Bears. Many guests choose this attraction to get photos of wildlife. It is the only way a guest can feed the adult bears at Yellowstone Bear World. ===Petting Zoo=== Visitors are encouraged to leave their cars and visit the petting zoo which consists of over one acre containing free-roaming farm animals and birds. There are also deer fawn or elk calf feedings at times. Amusement Rides at Yellowstone Bear World, Idaho 2018 ===Amusement Rides=== Yellowstone Bear World also has a small amusement park.

The only species is Trichomya hirsuta which is endemic to southern and eastern Australia. Its common names include the hairy mussel, the greenling and the kelp greenling. ==Description== The hairy mussel grows to a length of about . The lower valve of the shell has a dense covering of short hairs.Hairy mussel: Trichomya hirsuta NSW Government: Fishing and Aquaculture. Retrieved 2012-05-21. ==Distribution and habitat== The hairy mussel is found around the coasts of Tasmania and southern and eastern Australia as far north as Cairns. It lives on exposed reefs and among rocks and seaweed in the intertidal and subtidal zone, attaching itself to hard surfaces using its byssus threads.Mytilidae: Trichomya hirsuta (Lamarck, 1819) ('hairy mussel') Molluscs of Tasmania. Retrieved 2012-05-21. It is an important constituent of the seabed fauna where it forms dense beds of tangled material providing a habitat for other species. ==Research== The hairy mussel is a major part of the megafauna of Lake Macquarie, in New South Wales, Australia. Its dense growth tends to block condenser pipes and encrusts other submerged structures. It is tolerant of low oxygen levels in the water and its temperature tolerance range has been researched in connection with using the waters of the lake for cooling power stations. It was found to be much less tolerant to changes of water temperature than the mussel Mytilus edulis and the clam Mya arenaria. Bivalve molluscs tend to accumulate in their tissues any pollutants found in the surrounding waters and can be used as bioindicators. In a study of nine different species of mollusc found in tropical marine waters, it was concluded that the hairy mussel was the most suitable to monitor pollution. It reflected in its tissues the level of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Co, Ni, and Ag) in its environment and there was a linear relationship between the sedimentary levels and the tissue concentration of all the metals except zinc. ==References== Category:Mytilidae Category:Monotypic mollusc genera Category:Bivalve genera ","title":"Trichomya"},{"id":"35899004","text":"Jeunesse Junglinster is a football club, based in Junglinster, Luxembourg.

He oversaw the completion and release of How the West Was Won and Mutiny on the Bounty and the first film of his regime was Unsinkable Molly Brown. Among the films initiated under his management were Young Cassidy, 36 Hours, The Dirty Dozen and Dr Zhivago. MGM also expanded its TV production division. Under Weitman and O'Brien, MGM, which made a $30 million loss in 1963, turned around and made a profit of $17 million the following year. In 1966 they reported a $10 million profit.

The building axes measured about 93x80, those of the arena about 46.20x31.00. The surface of the arena was 1124.27 square meters. It housed fights between men and animals, of gladiators and other specialized fighters recruited in and outside Sardinia. It was also the seat of public executions. It could house up to 8,000 spectators, some one fourth of the Roman Caralis. The amphitheatre was no longer in use starting from the 5th century AD and was subsequently used as a free stone quarry by the rulers of the area, from the Byzantines, the Republic of Pisa, the House of Aragon and others. The area was acquired by the comune of Cagliari in the 19th century and excavated under the direction of a clergyman, Giovanni Spano. ==See also== * List of Roman amphitheatres ==References *Article in La Nuova Sardegna website * M.

He is a sandanme division champion. The highest rank he has reached is sekiwake. ==Early life and sumo background== From the third grade of elementary school, Sugiyama began practicing at a sumo dōjō near his home and began participating in national amateur sumo tournaments in junior high school. This exposure soon had him being scouted by several sumo stables. He chose to first finish high school and went on to university. He graduated from Kinki University in Osaka. ==Career== Takarafuji at the Kyushu tournament in November 2011 Upon his graduation, the former yokozuna Asahifuji, who had previously attended the same high school and university as Sugiyama, invited him to join Isegahama stable of which Asahifuji was head coach. Sugiyama's professional sumo career began in January 2009. He took the shikona of Takarafuji from the beginning, following the practice at Isegahama of wrestlers taking a ring name at the beginning rather than waiting for a promotion opportunity as most stables do. He advanced quickly through the lower ranks. He narrowly lost the jonokuchi championship in his debut, losing in a playoff. He then posted an impressive 6-1 in his jonidan division debut in the next tournament. In the following July 2009 tournament, he won the sandanme division championship with a perfect record and a playoff win. His progress slowed only slightly on entering the tougher makushita division. Through to July 2010 he posted only one losing tournament, and was promoted to the jūryō second division in September 2010. His promotion from makushita 2 to jūryō 12 was higher than normal due to seven other wrestlers being suspended for gambling on baseball. Regardless of being put at a higher rank than his record had yet warranted, he excelled, posting four consecutive winning records and advancing to the top-tier makuuchi division in July 2011 at maegashira 10. His debut in the division would turn out to be the same tournament that his stablemate, ōzeki Harumafuji would win the championship. This auspicious debut did little for his record, and an unimpressive 4–11 record had him demoted. For four tournaments, he alternated between losing records in makuuchi that bounced him down to jūryō where he would post an impressive enough record to achieve top-tier promotion again. Though he only posted a 6–9 record at maegashira 14 in the March 2012 tournament, unimpressive performances by many wrestlers in nearby ranks allowed him to stay in the makuuchi division at the bottom maegashira 16 rank for the May 2012 tournament. In this tournament he would finally post his first winning record, being in the championship race until late in the tournament before several consecutive losses knocked him out of the running. Since this time, he has been a managed to stay in the top division for the better part of three years, posting roughly alternating winning and losing tournaments, and was only demoted to jūryō once in November 2012 before bouncing right back into the top division. He earned his first kinboshi or gold star for defeating yokozuna Kakuryū in the January 2015 tournament, but he missed out on a first special prize and promotion to the san'yaku ranks after he failed to win on the final day and ended with a make-koshi 7–8 record. Winning records in March and May saw him promoted to komusubi for the first time but a 4–11 result in July saw him return to the rank and file. He managed only four wins in September but returned to form with ten wins in November and a winning record in January 2016 led to him being made komusubi again for the March tournament. In this tournament he defeated Hakuhō on the opening day, his first win over the yokozuna in eleven attempts. He beat Hakuhō again on the 5th day of the July tournament in Nagoya, ending the yokozuna's 33 bout winning streak. He ended the tournament with a 10–5 record and was awarded the special prize for Fighting Spirit. He was promoted to his highest rank to date of sekiwake for the following September 2016 tournament, but could only score 4–11 and was demoted. He has remained in the maegashira ranks since then. ==Fighting style== Takarafuji is a yotsu–sumo wrestler who prefers a hidari–yotsu, or right hand outside and left hand inside grip on his opponent's mawashi. His most common winning kimarite are the two most popular techniques in sumo, yorikiri or force out, and oshidashi or push out. ==Personal== On his promotion to the top division, his passing resemblance to the celebrity Matsuko Deluxe was noted by the Japanese media. He announced his marriage to a 24-year-old former dental assistant in December 2017, which had been registered in September. ==Career recordSee also== *List of sumo tournament top division runners-up *List of active gold star earners *Glossary of sumo terms *List of active sumo wrestlers *List of sekiwake ==References * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Aomori Prefecture Category:Sekiwake ","title":"Takarafuji Daisuke"},{"id":"35899725","text":"Charaxes boueti, the bamboo charaxes, is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

He was also a senator of the Twelfth Senatorial District of the Philippines. ==Early life== Alejandrino was born to a wealthy family from Arayat, Pampanga, on 1 December 1870 in Manila. He initially studied at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, and his contemporaries there included José Rizal, Juan Araneta, Cayetano Arellano, and Apolinario Mabini, among others. He acquired his Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Santo Tomas, and pursued studies in Spain and at the University of Ghent, where he graduated with a degree in chemical engineering. ==Propaganda Movement== While in Spain, he was one of the members of the Propaganda Movement which demanded equality, especially equal opportunities in the colonial administration, for Spaniards and Filipinos. He was also a contributor to La solidaridad, an organization composed of Filipino liberals living abroad since 1872, mostly attending different universities across Europe. The group aimed to increase Spanish awareness of the needs of its colony, the Philippines, and to foster a closer relationship between the archipelago and Spain. Alejandrino helped José Rizal in correcting errors in the El filibusterismo, which was published in Ghent, Belgium. He also helped distribute copies of the said manuscript. When Aguinaldo accepted the offer, Evangelista proceeded to Hong Kong, where he helped organise the Consejo Revolucionario along with Felipe Agoncillo, José Maria Basa and Mariano Ponce. Later, he became part of the group in the Hong Kong Committee, which included Agoncillo and Galicano Apacible, who was the head of La solidaridad, which advocated Philippines independence, as opposed to the circle led by Basa and Doroteo Cortes, who were for annexation by the United States. In February 1897, Alejandrino went to Japan in hopes of acquiring more weapons for the revolutionaries. He was with Aguinaldo when the latter was exiled to Hong Kong in accordance to the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, which was signed on 14 December 1897. ==Philippine-American War and postwar life== General Benito Natividad (seated, 2nd from right), Lt. Col. José Alejandrino (seated, 2nd from left) and their aides-de-camp. In 1898 Alejandrino served in the Malolos Congress, becoming a member of the two committees that drafted the Malolos Constitution. On 26 September, he was given the post of Director of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce. Later, Aguinaldo designated Alejandrino Chief of the engineers of the Army, and he directed the building of trenches in several areas, including Bulacan and Caloocan. Alejandrino and his friend, General Antonio Luna, suggested to President Emilio Aguinaldo that they build a defensive line from Novaliches to Caloocan to delay the northward advance of American troops intent on capturing the railway. This was however not implemented, as General Luna was murdered by troops loyal to Aguinaldo. The president was later captured and unconditionally surrendered to General Frederick Funston on 29 April 1901. On 12 April 1901, Alejandrino married Adela Chuidian, daughter of the reformist Telesforo Chuidian. In August of the same year, Alejandrino accepted an offer to serve as the second city engineer of Manila. In 1925, Governor-General Leonard Wood made him senator of the Twelfth Senatorial District of the Philippines. He died on June 1, 1951. ==Written works== * La Senda del Sacrificio (1949) ==Media portrayals== * Portrayed by Alvin Anson in the film, Heneral Luna (2015), and its sequel, Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral (2018). ==References== Category:1870 births Category:1951 deaths Category:Filipino generals Category:People of the Philippine–American War Category:People of the Philippine Revolution Category:Senators of the 7th Philippine Legislature Category:Kapampangan people Category:People from Pampanga Category:People from Manila Category:Nacionalista Party politicians Category:Secretaries of Agriculture of the Philippines Category:Aguinaldo Administration cabinet members Category:University of Santo Tomas alumni Category:Ghent University alumni Category:Members of the Malolos Congress ","title":"José Alejandrino"},{"id":"35899885","text":"Konyayev (masculine, ) or Konyayeva (feminine, ) is a Russian surname.

It follows an ostensible assassination plot of King Gojong (1852-1919), using coffee brewed by royal barista Tanya. The plan is masterminded by Sadako, a Joseon woman with adopted Japanese nationality, and aided by Ilyich, Tanya's lover. Inspired by conspiracy theories about Gojong and the king's well-known love of coffee, the movie's title Gabi is a turn-of- the-century Chinese-character transliteration of \\"coffee.\\" The film is based on author Kim Tak-hwan's historical fiction novel Noseoa Gabi (\\"Russian Coffee\\"). ==Plot== After his wife Empress Myeongseong is assassinated by the Japanese army and under threat of coup d'etat, Gojong the 26th king of Korea's Joseon Dynasty (Park Hee-soon) briefly seeks refuge at the Russian consulate in 1896. While he is there, he tastes and falls in love with a bittersweet drink that had yet to gain popularity in his homeland: coffee. Upon returning to the throne, King Gojong hires the beautiful and cosmopolitan Tanya (Kim So- yeon) as his personal barista. Tanya becomes involved in a dangerous social circle that involves not only the Russian sniper Ilyich (Joo Jin-mo) but also the mysterious socialite known as both Bae Jeong-ja and Sadako (Yoo Sun). With the Russian army hot on their trail, Tanya and her lover Ilyich eventually become ensnared in a plot to assassinate King Gojong that is orchestrated by Sadako, a Korean-Japanese collaborator. Ilyich becomes a spy to protect Tanya, who has begun to fall for Gojong while she makes his coffee every day. With her intimate connection to the King, making a drink that could easily conceal poison, Tanya must decide if she will become a pawn in the political battlefield of late 19th century Korea. ==Cast== *Kim So-yeon as Tanya *Joo Jin-mo as Ilyich *Park Hee-soon as King Gojong *Yoo Sun as Sadako *Jo Deok- hyeon as Seok-joo *Jo Kyeong-hun as underling *Kim Hyun-ah as court lady *Kim Ga-eun as Geum-hee *Kim Eung-soo as Miura *Jo Seung-yeon as Min Young-hwan *Jo Duk-je as spy *Kim Min-hyuk as Takeda *Hong Young-geun as Ryosuke *Um Hyo-sup as Tanya's father ==Historical basis== Born into a lowly background, Kim Hong- ryuk rose up in the ranks to be appointed as an interpreter for King Gojong in the latter's dealings with the Russian minister Karl Ivanovich Weber. Eventually his political ambition proved his undoing, and he was executed for allegedly trying to poison Gojong by spiking a cup of coffee with opium. ==Casting change== Lee Da-hae was originally cast in the lead role of Tanya via verbal agreement, but when she dropped out of the project ten days before filming began, production company Ocean Film sued her for breach of contract. In September 2012, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, ordering Lee to pay () in damages, or 40% liability. ==Awards== *2012 Korean Culture and Entertainment Awards: Excellence Award, Actress in a Film - Kim So-yeon *2014 Golden Cinema Festival: Gold Medal in Cinematography - Oh Hyun-je ==References External links == * * * Gabi at Naver * * * Category:2012 films Category:South Korean mystery films Category:South Korean historical films Category:South Korean spy films Category:Films about politicians Category:Films set in 1896 Category:Films set in the Joseon Dynasty Category:Films set in Seoul Category:Films based on South Korean novels Category:Films based on thriller novels Category:Films directed by Chang Yoon- hyun Category:Cinema Service films Category:Korean-language films ","title":"Gabi (film)"},{"id":"35899895","text":"Charaxes macclounii, the wild-bamboo charaxes or red coast charaxes, is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

He began his musical career in 1935 when he joined a tango ensemble as double bass player with the pianist José Pascual and Anselmo Aiete. In 1939, he joined the orquesta típica of Aníbal Troilo, which included Orlando Goñi (piano), Roberto Gianitelli, Juan Miguel Toto Rodríguez (bandoneon) and the singer Francisco Fiorentino. Díaz would stay with Troilo until 1959. He joined Ástor Piazzolla’s first Quinteto in 1960 and later Piazzolla would write the tango Kicho as a tribute to him. In 1968 Piazzolla put together an orchestra, including Díaz, to perform his operetta María de Buenos Aires, and between 1971 and 1972 Díaz played with Piazzolla’s Conjunto 9. In 1962 he joined Quinteto Real with Horacio Salgán (piano), Ubaldo de Lío, Enrique Mario Francini (violin) and Pedro Laurenz (badoneon) and occasionally played with the orquestra of Mariano Mores. Later in 1976 he joined Sexteto Mayor with whom he played until his death in 1992.

He is particularly notable for interpretations of lieder and oratorios. During his career, Sistermans premiered important compositions by Johannes Brahms and Gustav Mahler, and also had lieder dedicated to him by Hans Pfitzner, Eugen d'Albert and Alexander von Zemlinsky. In his later years, Sistermans served as a teacher at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague and conductor of a church choir in Rotterdam. ==Biography== Anton Sistermans was born in 's-Hertogenbosch, in 1865. He was initially a choir boy, then studied under Julius Stockhausen in Frankfurt. His solo debut was in 1889, in a performance of the Verdi Requiem in Strasbourg. He performed Beethoven's Kantate auf den Tod Kaiser Josephs II (cantata in memory of Joseph II) and Ninth Symphony in a concert in Wuppertal on 17 December 1892, which also included Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 and was conducted by Hans Haym. On 16 March 1896, he premiered the orchestral version of Gustav Mahler's Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen in Berlin, with the composer conducting the Berlin Philharmonic. On 9 November of the same year, Sistermans gave the first performance of Johannes Brahms's Vier ernste Gesänge in Vienna with pianist Coenraad V. Bos. The composer declined Sisterman's requests to be the pianist at the premiere performance, likely because Brahms could not bear to hear the songs in light of the imminent demise of Clara Schumann, for whom they were closely associated. Whether Brahms attended the premiere at all is a matter of dispute among sources. Edvard Grieg requested Sistermans, who was then \\"by some considered the best singer of Lieder\\", to sing his Scenes from Olav Trygvason at the Leeds Festival on 16 October 1907. Sisterman appeared in operatic performances, but these were fewer in number. His performances included Gurnemanz in Parsifal and Pogner in Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, at the 1899 Bayreuth Festival; Titurel in Parsifal in Amsterdam in 1919; and Tommaso in Eugen d'Albert's Tiefland in the Hague in 1923. He made a few sparse recordings in 1904 and 1906, limited to selected lieder of Brahms. He later taught at the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory in Berlin, the Royal Conservatory of The Hague, and conducted a church choir in Rotterdam. Works dedicated to him include: * Eugen d'Albert: Songs, Op. 21 * Hans Pfitzner: Five Lieder, Op. 9 * Erich Jaques Wolff: song, Tag meines Lebens, Op. 13/2 * Alexander von Zemlinsky: Thirteen Songs, Op. 2 Anton Sistermans died in the Hague in 1926, aged 60. == References  * *Anton Sistermans 401dutchdivas.nl 2007 * Category:1865 births Category:1926 deaths Category:19th-century Dutch singers Category:Dutch operatic baritones Category:Dutch music educators Category:Dutch opera singers Category:Operatic baritones Category:People from 's-Hertogenbosch Category:Royal Conservatory of The Hague faculty Category:Voice teachers Category:19th-century male singers ","title":"Anton Sistermans"},{"id":"35900134","text":"Bavaria non-alcoholic beer is a non-alcoholic beer (0.0% ABV) brewed by the Bavaria Brewery.

He was a jūryō division champion in 2012. The highest rank he has reached was maegashira 2. He is now a coach at Sakaigawa stable. ==Early life and sumo background== During his school years, he practiced judo. On graduating from high school, through the efforts of a former teacher, he made contact with Nakadachi (later Sakaigawa) stable and was accepted. His ring debut was in January 2003. ==Career== Sadanofuji in September 2010 Sadanofuji spent over seven years in the lower divisions, spending a significant amount of time in all but the lowest division. He spent the bulk of his career in the third makushita division, posting largely 4–3 and 3–4 records. In the March 2009 tournament he achieved a 6–1 record and participated in an eight wrestler playoff for the makushita championship. He won against his first two opponents in the playoff, but ultimately lost the championship to Tokushinhō in the final bout of the playoff. Following this, his sumo grew more consistent and over the next five tournaments he achieved strong winning records in all but one tournament. In March 2010 he finally reached the second jūryō division. Two losing tournaments put him back in makushita for one tournament, but he was back up again for the following September 2010 tournament. After one more year in jūryō he was promoted to the top-tier makuuchi division. Sadanofuji produced a bare majority of wins in his first two top division tournaments, but then had four successive make-koshi or losing scores, which saw him demoted back to jūryō. However, he made a strong comeback in the November 2012 tournament, winning his first yūshō or tournament championship with a 14–1 record and earning immediate promotion back to makuuchi. He was in the top division for eight consecutive tournaments until being demoted for the May 2014 tournament. In 2015 he established himself as a top division regular, recording his best score to date of 10–5 in the July 2015 tournament, which saw him ranked among the top maegashira for the first time. In September however, wrestling at maegashira 2 he lost his first thirteen matches before salvaging wins in the last two days to end with a 2–13 record. He was demoted from the top division after scoring only 4–11 in the following tournament in November 2015. He re-appeared in makuuchi in July 2016 but was unable to stay longer than a single tournament. After scoring only 4–11 and 2–13 in the jūryō division in September and November 2016 he was relegated to the makushita division for the January 2017 tournament, losing sekitori status for the first time since 2010. He withdrew from the March tournament with injury and was relegated to sandanme for the first time since 2006. ==Retirement from sumo== Sadanofuji retired after the May 2017 tournament. He has stayed with the Japan Sumo Association as a coach at his stable, initially under the borrowed elder name of Nakamura Oyakata held by Yoshikaze. His danpatsu-shiki, or retirement ceremony, was held at the Ryogoku Kokugikan on September 2, 2017, with around 300 people taking a cut of his hair. In August 2019 he switched to the Yamashina elder name, previously used by former komusubi Ōnishiki. ==Personal life== Sadanofuji was the tsukebito of the upper division wrestler Iwakiyama for many years, but in 2009 his coach, seeing his potential, released him from his duties so he could concentrate on his sumo. His younger brother Koki joined his stable in 2009 under the shikona Obamaumi and reached makushita in July 2017. Sadanofuji was the first wrestler in makuuchi since Chiyonofuji to have five characters in his ring name. Sadanofuji announced his engagement at a press conference in June 2013. The wedding reception was held the following February, and the couple's first child was born in January 2015. ==Fighting style== Sadnofuji was a pusher–thruster who was not keen on fighting on the mawashi or belt. His most common winning kimarite was oshi dashi, a straightforward push out. He weighed at the Aki basho in September 2015, making him the joint-heaviest man in the top division alongside Ichinojō. ==Career recordSee also== *List of sumo tournament second division champions *Glossary of sumo terms *List of heaviest sumo wrestlers *List of past sumo wrestlers *List of sumo elders ==References * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Nagasaki Prefecture ","title":"Sadanofuji Akihiro"},{"id":"35900315","text":"Charaxes lemosi is a butterfly in the family Nymphalidae.

The interior of the church. Santa Maria is a medieval church in the comune of Uta, Sardinia, Italy. The exact date of construction is unknown, although it is generally assigned to the mid-12th century by monks from the Abbey of St. Victor in Marseille, perhaps on the ruins of a pre- existing structure. It is an example of Provençal and Tuscan Romanesque styles' influence on the local medieval architecture (at the time the area was under the rule of the Republic of Pisa). Apse view. The oldest known mention of the church is in a 1363 document, by which king Peter IV of Aragon switched it from the Knights Hospitaller to the Order of Sant Jordi d'Alfama. The edifice was later held by the Franciscans, who, in the late 16th century, gave it to the archdiocese of Cagliari. ==Description== The exterior is built in limestone and sandstone, with parts in marble and basalt. The walls feature pilasters at the corners, and are divided by lesenes among which are Lombard bands (triple in the façade and double at the sides and in the apse area). The Lombard bands are characterized by bases with various sculptures of human and animal figures. The main façade, pointing westwards, has a flat central bell tower and is divided into four levels by frames. The lower part is in turn divided into three sections: the middle one houses the portal, which is surmounted by a rounded arch in two colors and a finely sculpted motif in the frame. The upper section has a small double mullioned window. The church has a nave and two aisles with wooden ceilings, separated by round arches; these are supported by columns from older Roman edifices. The capitals are instead contemporary of the church, aside from two (including one acting as holy water font). The presbytery is elevated and accessed by two steps. Under the high altar are two sculpted lions, which were originally placed at the sides of the façade. The presbytery ends in a semicircular apse. Light is provided by two double mullioned windows in the eastern and western walls and by single mullioned windows in the main walls and the apse. ==Sources== * * ==External links== *Official website Category:Romanesque architecture in Sardinia Maria Uta Category:12th-century churches ","title":"Santa Maria, Uta"},{"id":"35900416","text":"Tibor Čiča (born 31 December 1993) is a Swedish-born Croatian footballer who plays for IFK Simrishamn.http://osterlensport.se/2018/11/14/tibor-cica- jonathan-karlsen-bassam-ahmad-och-rasmus-nilsson-klara-for-ifk-simrishamn/ ==Biography== Born in Sweden to Croatian parents, Čiča started playing football at the age of 5, for the local Croatian immigrant football team NK Croatia Malmö.

It stars veteran actor Adam Cheng and internationally acclaimed 2007 TVB Anniversary Awards Best Actor Moses Chan in the lead role, portraying characters playing a cat-and-mouse game of deceit, suspense and intrigue. ==Synopsis== Kan Siu-Nam (Adam Cheng), due to the loss of his daughter Tansy, divorces his wife, Angela (Rebecca Chan). He whole-heartedly focuses on his acting career since then, still clinging on to the belief that his daughter was still alive. Due to a role in which he plays a murderer, he becomes embroiled into a serial killer case. Through his acquaintance Esther (Maggie Shiu), he meets renowned magician Ivan (Moses Chan) and his sister Natalie (Aimee Chan). As a spate of serial killings hits Hong Kong, Kan suspects that Ivan is related to the incidents. Pitting his wits against Ivan's schemes, Kan seeks to reveal the truth behind the killings, and discover the truth behind his daughter's disappearance. ==Plot summary== Kan Siu-Nam (Adam Cheng) is a stage actor whose daughter, Tansy, was wrongly kidnapped more than 20 years ago. Refusing to accept it as a fact, he clings on to the belief that she is still alive. When called upon to play the role of a convicted murderer who insists he is wronged, Kan discovers that he can use his skills to replicate the subject's psyche in his own mind and take on other people's persona within himself. Ivan Cheung Sai-yin (Moses Chan) is a stage magician who has a dark past of his own, being involved in the kidnapping of Siu-Nam's daughter Tansy. Ever since his father disappeared when he was a child, he has been living a new life with his sister Natalie (Aimee Chan). When an old acquaintance from his past reappears, threatening to unravel his present life, he has no choice but to kill him. However, killing him triggers Ivan's dissociative identity disorder, unlocking his other personalities: Eric, the personification of his evilness; Michelle, the personification of his lust and envy; Edwin, the personification of his pride and cunningness; and Martin, the personification of his wrath and temper. These 4 personalities influence him to kill more and more people, in order to keep his past a secret. As fate would have it, Siu- Nam and Ivan eventually cross paths despite the latter's attempt to avoid him. When a streak of serial killings hit Hong Kong, the police seek Siu-Nam's assistance in the investigations. As Siu-Nam digs deeper, he realizes that Ivan is more complicated than he appears to be, and that Ivan was related to his daughter's kidnap. In order to find out the truth, Siu-Nam replicates Ivan's psyche in his own mind, unwittingly taking on Ivan's 4 other personas as well. Getting too deep into Ivan's psyche, with the other personalities dominating him, Siu-Nam starts to lose his grip on reality, becoming every bit as dangerous as Ivan. Can he unravel the truth before he is consumed by madness? Who will win in this battle of wits and emerge as the Master of Play? ==CastKan family=== { width=\\"60%\\" - style=\\"background:cornflowerblue; color:white\\" align=center style=\\"width:6%\\"Actorstyle=\\"width:6%\\"Characterstyle=\\"width:15%\\"Description - Adam ChengKan Siu Nam (靳兆楠)A stage actor Angela's ex-husband Father of Kan Chi-ying Suffered from mental illness in Episode 29 Believes Cheung Sai-yin (章世言) is in his mind Body was taken over by Cheung Sai-yin's personas in Episode 30 Almost died in Episode 30 attempting a magic act under Sai-yin's influence.

It is one of the few surviving examples of Ottonian architecture, built in 959/960-965 by Margrave Gero, although it was restored in the 19th century. From its foundation until 1614 Saint Cyriakus was the collegiate church of the abbey of Gernrode, also founded by Margrave Gero. The church and the abbey became Protestant in the mid-sixteenth century, and the church is now used by the Protestant community of Gernrode. The church is part of the tourist route Romanesque Road, as it is an important example of an Ottonian church which inspired later, fully Romanesque, churches and cathedrals. ==History== Gero (d. 965) was a follower of Otto I from one of the most powerful families of eastern Saxony. In 937, Otto made Gero Margrave of the Eastern March. Gero, who owned a castle at Gernrode, decided to found a collegiate church and female (lay) convent (Stift) here, in cooperation with his son Siegfried. Construction on the crypt, the eastern apse and the convent started in 959. In 961, the foundation was awarded royal protection and in 963 the pope issued a privilege, which removed the convent from the influence of the Bishop of Halberstadt. Siegfried had died heirless in 959. After Siegfried's death, his widow Hathui had become abbess of the convent. Gero returned from a trip to Rome with a valuable relic of Saint Cyriacus and the church was dedicated to this saint in 963. In 965, Gero died and was buried in front of the already finished eastern choir. A hiatus in construction followed Gero's death and is seen as the likely source of the shift in the church's axis - see map. Hathui ruled the convent for 55 years until her death in 1014. Plan of the church showing the shift in axis between the eastern and western parts. View of the interior In 999, Emperor Otto III granted the convent Imperial status and in 1004, Empress Kunigunde, wife of Emperor Heinrich II visited the convent. The first stage of construction ended in 1014. That same year, on Hathui's death, Adelheid, daughter of Emperor Otto II succeeded her as abbess. Adelheid held that position until 1044. Additions to the church in the 11th and 12th centuries include the west crypt (first mentioned in 1149), side galleries, the enlargement of the westwork (1127-1150) and the towers and the two-storey cloisters (1170). In 1188, Emperor Friedrich I Barbarossa held court at Gernrode and gifted the \\"Barbarossa Bell\\" . The vaults of the transept were added in the Gothic period. The last Catholic abbess was Scholastika von Anhalt Dessau (1469-1504). Her successor, Elisabeth von Weida (1504-76) introduced Reformation in 1521. In 1525, Elisabeth managed to prevent damage to the convent during the German Peasants' War. With its introduction into the Landeskirche the convent lost its independence and fell under the influence of the local princes. Abbess Anna von Plauen (1532-49) founded the first school and supported the convent's role in providing medical care. From 1533, the collegiate church was shared with the parish. When Gernrode was awarded the status of town in 1539, the abbess donated a coat of arms. The last Stiftsdame (and by default abbess), Sophie Elisabeth, left the abbey in 1614. In 1619, the abbey became a secular domain of the prince. Medieval works of art were removed, the buildings fell into disrepair and parts of the church were used for agriculture. In 1669, Friedrich von Harzgerode purchased the town and the church. Renovations were carried out in 1754-6. In 1806, with the end of the Holy Roman Empire, the convent finally lost its Imperial status and immunity and was subsumed by the Duchy of Anhalt- Bernburg. Over the following decades, the convent fell into ruin, the inventory was auctioned off until the purchase, in 1832, by Amtmann Henneberg. He secularized the church and converted the convent into a farming estate. In the late 1830s, interest in the church and convent resurfaced, with art historian Franz Theodor Kugler publishing a description in 1838 and calling for its renovation in 1839. At the request of Duke Alexander Carl von Anhalt- Bernburg, architect :de:Ferdinand von Quast then restored the church in 1859-73. Further work followed in 1907-10, when the two towers of the west works were first removed and then rebuilt with strengthened foundations. Between 1960 and 1984, communist East Germany had the court and convent buildings restored. From 1984-7, the church interior was renovated. Post reunification, in 1992 the roof was sheathed in copper. More work was done in 2003-4 on the western apse and the Holy Sepulchre. ==Description== The central body of the church has a nave and two aisles, surrounded by the eastern transept and the westwork, which is sided by two towers. These elements, typical of the Carolingian architecture, were paired by novelties anticipating the Romanesque style: as the alternation of pillars and columns (a hallmark of numerous later churches in Saxony), the thick walls, the semi-blind arcades in galleries on the nave (similar to a triforium). The capitals of the columns show a variety of elements, with stylized leaves of acanthus and, in one case, human heads. Tomb of Margrave Gero The tomb of Margrave Gero sits in the crossing before the steps to the choir. It is covered by a sandstone slab, carved into Gero's likeness, showing him in armor with sword and a flag. A lion is at his feet. Relief on the western wall of the Holy Sepulchre with a figure of Mary Magdalene The southern aisle houses a copy of the grave of Christ (a representation of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem), most likely dating to the period 1080 to 1130. It is the oldest of its kind in Germany and also one of the most original, having little in common with the Holy Grave in Jerusalem. The entrance to the structure was moved from the usual east to the north side when the galleries were added in the 12th century. Parts of the outer decorations of the tomb were intentionally destroyed, but it is unclear whether this happened during the 12th-century reconstruction or in the final introduction of Reformation in 1616. The interior and exterior sculptures of the tomb are considered a masterwork of early Romanesque statuary art. The baptismal font from around 1150 came from a demolished Romanesque church in Alsleben. The painted ceilings were added during the 19th-century renovation which also lined most of the walls with cut stone panels - the original Ottonian walls featured rough quarry stone masonry. ==References== * ==External links== * Official website * Page at transromanica website * Website of Strasse der Romanik (tourist route) Category:Protestant churches in Saxony-Anhalt Category:Buildings and structures in Harz (district) Category:10th-century churches Category:Ottonian architecture Category:Romanesque Road ","title":"Saint Cyriakus, Gernrode"},{"id":"35900604","text":"Ilse Lehiste (31 January 1922 – 25 December 2010) was an Estonian-born American linguist, author of many studies in phonetics. ==Early life== Ilse Lehiste finished high school in Tallinn and studied piano playing at the Conservatory.

Species in this order infect marine invertebrates — usually annelids, ascidians, hemichordates and sipunculids. ==Taxonomy== This order was redefined by Levine in 1971. The order currently consists of 76 species in two families — Exoschizonidae and Selenidioididae. The family Exoschizonidae contains one genus — Exoschizon — which has one species. The family Selenidioididae has six genera: Filipodium with 3 species, Merogregarina with one species, Meroselenidium with one species, Platyproteum with one species, Selenidioides with 11 species and Veloxidium with one species. ==Phylogenetics== DNA studies suggest that the archigregarines are ancestral to the other gregarines. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that this group is paraphyletic and will need division. The Neogregarinorida appear to be derived from the Eugregarinorida. Assuming this is correct the evolutionary order appears to be: the Archigregarinorida gave rise to the Eugregarinorida who in turn gave rise to the Neogregarinorida. Morrison using molecular data has shown that the Haemosporidia appear to nest within the gregarines. ==Description== The species in this order are relatively large spindle shaped cells, compared to other apicomplexans and eukaryotes in general (some species are in length). Most gregarines have longitudinal epicytic folds (bundles of microtubules beneath the cell surface with nematode like bending behaviour). *Syzygy occurs in all species *Monoxenous — only one host in life cycle *Mitochondria have tubular cristae and are often distributed near the cell periphery *Apical complex is present in both the sporozoite and trophozoite stages *Trophozoites have a large and conspicuous nucleus and nucleolus *Inhabit extracellular body cavities of invertebrates such as the intestines, coeloms and reproductive vesicles *Attachment to host via a mucron (aseptate gregarines) or an epimerite (septate gregarines) *Possess longitudinal epicytic folds *Have a myzocytosis-based mode of feeding ==Life cycle== Archigregarines are found only in marine habitats and are transmitted by the orofaecal route. Merogony, gamogony and sporogony are thought to occur in all species in this taxon. In all species four or more sporozoites (the precise number depends on the species) equipped with an apical complex escape from the oocysts, find their way to the appropriate body cavity and penetrate host cells in their immediate environment. The sporozoites emerge within the host cell, begin to feed and develop into larger trophozoites. In some species, the sporozoites and trophozoites are capable of asexual replication — a process called schizogony or merogony. Most species however appear to lack schizogony in their lifecycles. The intestinal trophozoites are similar in morphology to the infective sporozoites. In all species two mature trophozoites eventually pair up in a process known as (syzygy) and develop into gamonts. The gamonts are aseptate. During syzygy gamont orientation differs between species (side to side, head to tail). A gametocyst wall forms around each pair of gamonts which then begin to divide into hundreds of gametes. Zygotes are produced by the fusion of two gametes and these in turn become surrounded by an oocyst wall. Within the oocyst meiosis occurs yielding the sporozoites. Hundreds of oocysts accumulate within each gametocyst and these are released via host's faeces or via host death and decay. ==References== Category:Apicomplexa orders ","title":"Archigregarinorida"},{"id":"35900677","text":"Basílio Emídio de Moraes Júnior (born 11 May 1982, in João Pessoa, Paraíba) is a Brazilian sprinter who competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics. == Achievements == { - !bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" colspan=\\"6\\"Representing - rowspan=21998 rowspan=2South American Youth Championships rowspan=2Manaus, Brazil bgcolor=gold1st 100 m 10.6 s (wind: -1.9 m/s) - bgcolor=silver2nd 200 m 21.72 s (wind: 0.0 m/s) - rowspan=22004 rowspan=2South American U23 Championships rowspan=2Barquisimeto, Venezuela bgcolor=silver2nd 200m 21.06 (wind: +0.0 m/s) - bgcolor=gold1st 4 × 100 m relay 39.42 } ==References== * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian male sprinters Category:Olympic athletes of Brazil Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for Brazil Category:Pan American Games medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2007 Pan American Games ","title":"Basílio de Moraes"},{"id":"35900679","text":"Édouard Vincent Joseph Dreyfus González de Orbegoso, 5th count of Premio Real (1876–1941) was a French Catholic businessman of Jewish descent, a lawyer, painter and writer, who was also an amateur composer under the pseudonym of Jean Dora.

Smith was the conference coach of the year. ===1969=== The 1969 team finished the regular season at and in the Idaho swept two from Air Force at home in Moscow to advance, then lost on the road in the District 7 finals at Mesa to host the eventual CWS champion. ==1970s== The Big Sky expanded to eight teams in the summer of 1970, all with baseball, and split into two divisions for the 1971 season with a three-game playoff to determine the The two Montana schools soon dropped the sport and Boise State was moved to the Northern Division with Idaho and Gonzaga for 1973. In May 1974, the Big Sky announced its discontinued sponsorship of baseball (and four other sports). Southern division champion Idaho State dropped their team weeks later, and three-time conference champion Weber State followed. The three Northern division schools (Idaho, Boise State, Gonzaga) joined the new Northern Pacific Conference (NorPac) for the 1975 season. (The NorPac included the larger baseball programs in the Northwest outside of the Pac-8, including Portland State, Portland, Seattle U., Puget Sound, and later, Eastern Washington.) Ken Schrom of Grangeville was selected in the tenth round of the 1973 MLB Draft as a high school senior, but opted for college. Also a quarterback for the football team, he pitched for the Vandals for three seasons until selected in the 1976 draft following his junior year. (An injury to his non-throwing (left) shoulder during the previous football season influenced his decision to leave school early.) ==1980== After six seasons in the NorPac, both Idaho and Boise State discontinued baseball as a varsity sport , following the 1980 season, citing budget (BSU's program returned four decades later, in 2020.) An assistant coach in football and basketball for the Vandals, Smith was the head baseball coach for the final fourteen seasons (1967–1980), then continued in the UI athletic department as equipment manager for the next seven When John L. Smith (b.1948) arrived on campus as an assistant football coach in 1982, both began using their middle initial to avoid confusion. The last varsity game with neighbor Washington State was a home win on April 30, 1980, which was the first over the Cougars in thirteen years, breaking a losing streak of over forty games (with two ties) dating back to 1967. The final games for the program were less than two weeks later, two doubleheaders against Puget Sound: the Vandals swept on Friday, and were washed out on Saturday. ===Club sport=== Baseball resurfaced on campus as a club sport in 1984. ==VenuesMacLean Field=== Idaho's ballpark from the early 1920s through 1966 was MacLean Field, just west of the Administration Building. Its infield was originally located in the southwest corner of the multi-sport venue, with Memorial Gymnasium as a backdrop in left field and the running track's west stretch in center and right field. After Neale Stadium opened for football in autumn 1937, home plate was moved to the opposite northeast corner of MacLean () for the 1940 season, with the former football grandstand on the east berm along the third base line. The southern portion of the permanent football seating, adjacent to left field, was excess capacity for baseball and was removed during World War II. The new southwestern alignment (home plate to center field) had abundant foul territory, especially along the third base line; track and field continued at MacLean until after the war, and this area was occupied by various field events. Other than a backstop, there was little foul territory fencing, except to protect a parking lot to the right; it also went without dugouts, as the teams sat on open benches. Later seasons employed a low temporary outfield fence, and new tennis courts in right field with perimeter chain-link fencing provided a higher permanent barrier; until 1955, the tennis courts were at the site of the library. The distance down the left field line in 1959 was The old southwest infield became the site of the multi-purpose field house (1949–75) in deep right center It was razed after the enclosure of the Kibbie Dome in 1975 and was soon occupied by additional outdoor tennis courts; the trees that were along its east wall continue to stand. The swim center and P.E. building (women's gym), opened in 1970, are in the MacLean outfield, from right to center field. Left field continues today as open grass; its backdrop was the Shattuck Arboretum to the south and the berm between them provided elevated grass ===Guy Wicks Field=== After the 1966 season, construction of the new College of Education building began behind home plate, and a new baseball field was built at the northwest area of campus, just south of Paradise Creek (and Pullman Road) (). Aligned southeast with above-ground dugouts and a modest concrete grandstand, it opened as \\"University Field\\" in April and was named for late alumnus Guy Wicks, a two- sport head coach and university administrator, during the 1969 postseason. It was also without permanent fencing, and used a low temporary one in the outfield; the backdrop in left center was the six-story Wallace dormitory. ==See also== *List of defunct college baseball teams ==References== Category:Baseball teams established in 1900 Category:Baseball teams disestablished in 1980 Category:1900 establishments in Idaho Category:1980 disestablishments in Idaho ","title":"Idaho Vandals baseball"},{"id":"35900695","text":"Ndadaye Day is a public holiday in Burundi celebrated on October 21.

The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 5 station. It is in the southern part of the town of Oberwesel and is served by Regional-Express services operated by Deutsche Bahn and Regionalbahn trains operated by trans regio Deutsche Regionalbahn. ==History == Oberwesel station was opened with the extension of the West Rhine Railway from Koblenz to Bingen at the end of 1859. In 1896, a track was built to the port. In 1907/08, the station building was extended by additions on its sides: an office for the station master, a station restaurant, and a 3rd class waiting room were added. In 1925–1927, the lobby was renovated and a separate toilet block was constructed on Mainzer Strasse. In 1956, a pedestrian underpass was built under the tracks and in 1969/70 a building housing a relay interlocking was built next to the entrance building. In 2004, in the course of the construction of a park and ride facility, the toilet block was torn down. ==Infrastructure== The station building at Oberwesel currently only accommodates residences and the interlocking. Tickets can be purchased at two ticket machines in the station entrance. The ticket office at the bus station acts as an agent of Deutsche Bahn and also sells rail tickets. The station has three platform tracks. The “home” platform (platform 1) is connected by a pedestrian underpass to the central platform (tracks 2 and 3). In general, trains towards Mainz stop at platform 1 and trains towards Koblenz stop at track 2. Track 3 is used only by services that begin or end here or are overtaken (scheduled or unscheduled) here. A new park and ride facility was built during the modernisation of the station. This includes approximately 100 parking spaces and parking for taxis, motor-scooters and bicycles. There are several bus bays for regional bus services. ==Rail services== Oberwesel station is served by the following regional services: {  -  Line  Line name  Route  Frequency  Days of operation -    Koblenz – Boppard – Oberwesel – Bingen (Rhein) – Mainz – Frankfurt Airport (regional) – Frankfurt (Main) Hbf  120 min  Working days except Saturdays -    Koblenz – Boppard – Oberwesel – Bingen – Kaiserslautern  120 min  daily -   MittelrheinBahn  Koblenz – Boppard – Oberwesel – Bingen (Rhein) – Ingelheim – Mainz  60 min  Daily } During peak hours there are extra services on both routes.

Oxy. 221 Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 221 (P. Oxy. 221 or P. Oxy. II 221) contains Homeric scholia by an unknown author, written in Greek. It was discovered in Oxyrhynchus, Egypt. The manuscript was written on papyrus in the form of a roll. It is dated to the second century. Frederic G. Kenyon dated it to the first century or the first half of the second century. Currently it is housed in the British Library (Department of Manuscripts, 1184) in London.P. Oxy. 221 at the Oxyrhynchus Online == Description == The document was written by an unknown copyist. The verso side contains Homeric scholia on the 21st book of the Iliad. The recto side is known as Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 220. The text is written in an informal uncial hand. It uses points, breathing, and accents sparingly; iota and upsilon sometimes have diaeresis. There are a large number of corrections, many of which were made by the original scribe. There is a note in cursive added above margin of column XVIII; there is a signature in semi-cursive hand between columns X and XI. It was discovered by Grenfell and Hunt in 1897 in Oxyrhynchus. The text was published by Grenfell and Hunt in 1899. ==Significance== This papyrus was unique at the time of its discovery in being datable by both physical evidence and textual evidence. Thus Grenfell and Hunt state that \\"we have here for the first time an almost contemporary specimen of a first century commentary on the Iliad.\\" The point, then, is that the quotations from Homer in the text must accurately reflect the state of available manuscripts of the Iliad in the first century, unlike previously known collections of scholia, whose manuscripts were copied many centuries after the texts were written, which makes it impossible to know whether the Homeric quotations were corrupt. Furthermore, the papyrus contains a number of previously unknown quotations from ancient Greek authors, including Hesiod, Pindar, Alcaeus, Sophocles, and Aristotle. == See also == * Oxyrhynchus Papyri * Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 220 * Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 223 == References == 221 Category:1st-century manuscripts Category:Manuscripts of the Iliad Category:British Library collections ","title":"Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 221"},{"id":"35900817","text":"The Irish College of General Practitioners or ICGP is the recognised national professional body for general practice training in Ireland.

Borsdorf was born in Saxony in 1854. He studied the French horn at the Conservatoire in Dresden and played in a military band. In 1879 he moved to England where he stayed for the rest of his life, becoming the most important horn player in England. The conductor Hans Richter offered him a job in the orchestra at Covent Garden. In 1904 he joined the newly formed London Symphony Orchestra. The four horn players in that orchestra were excellent players and were often called “God’s Own Quartet”. Borsdorf and his colleague Franz Paersch had learned to play on wide-bore horns that were made in Germany. However, both changed to playing narrow-bore instruments made in France by Raoux. Though not quite as powerful as the German models, they produced a particularly clear sound. Borsdorf became a professor at the Royal College of Music when it was founded in 1882. He also taught at the Royal Academy of Music. He soon became the best horn player in London. He was playing principal horn in the orchestra which Henry Wood conducted at the very first Promenade Concert in the Queen’s Hall in 1895 (the fourth horn was A. E. Brain Sr., grandfather of Dennis Brain). He was also in the orchestra when Richard Strauss’s Till Eulenspiegel was given its first performance in England in 1896 with the composer conducting. In 1913 he became ill and had to have teeth removed. There was also another problem for him: World War I broke out in 1914 and there was a lot of anti-German feeling in England. After the war he rarely played in public. Borsdorf died in 1923. He had done more than anyone else to improve the standard of horn playing in England. He taught many talented pupils, including A. E. Brain Jr., Aubrey Brain, Frank Probyn and his own three sons, Oskar, Francis and Emil, who all became professional horn players. The younger Borsdorfs changed their surname to Bradley because of anti-German sentiment; Oskar became (as Oscar Bradley) a successful composer and conductor for CBS and Francis stayed in London, retiring from the ENO orchestra in 1976. ==References== * Borsdorf on the Hornsociety website * Oxford Music Online retrieved 21.11.2010 * Pettitt, Stephen.

In 1746 the family returned to Denmark. After first training with his father, Carl Frederik Stanley became one of the first students to enter the new Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1755. THat same year he won his first award and in 1758 he won the Academy's large gold medal for the sculpture Noah's Sacrifice. The gold medal was accompanied by a six-year travel scholarship and the following year he went abroad to further his education. He first settled in Paris, where he studied under the sculptor Guillaume Coustou. In 1762 he moved to Rome, where he studied and made copies of Classical sculptures, before returning to Denmark in 1766. ==Career== Back in Denmark in 1768, Stanley was commissioned to design the marble funerary monument to Queen Louise in Roskilde Cathedral. He exhibited sketches for the monument at the Academy's first exhibition in 1769 but it was not completed until 1791. During the 1770s and 1780s he executed various other monuments, such as that to the shipbuilder Peter Applebye (c. 1774), Christian's Church). He also contributed to the decorations at the Court Theatre and of the Knight's Hall at Christiansborg Palace. In 1776 he was unanimously accepted as a member of the Royal Art Academy and the following year he received Danish citizenship and was appointed a professor there. From 1784 to 1785 he worked on a series of allegorical and historical reliefs for the plinth of the Trade and Navigation Monument at Lyngby. He produced few works after the early 1790s. ==Works== Danish National Gallery Stanley's most significant work remained his funerary monument to Queen Louise. It is located in Frederick V's Chapel and designed in a severe, Neo-classical style. His admittance piece for the Royal Art Academy was the allegorical Amor patriae of which several examples exist in various materials. Executed in an elegant Neo-classical style, the work shows a partly draped classical figure holding a sword in one hand and a wreath in the other. The statue represents a growing awareness of national identity and history in Denmark which was typical of the time. The previous year, King Christian VII had introduced nationality laws which meant that Government posts and other public offices would in general be reserved for Danish citizens. Stanley also produced a number of portrait busts, including a posthumous plaster bust of Johannes Ewald (1784, Danish National Gallery). ==See also== * Danish sculpture ==References Category:Danish sculptors Category:English male sculptors Category:Artists from Copenhagen Category:Sculptors from London Category:People from Westminster Category:British emigrants to Denmark Category:Danish people of English descent Category:1813 deaths Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"Carl Frederik Stanley"},{"id":"35900854","text":"Hillel Schenker is co-editor of the Palestine-Israel Journal, a Jerusalem- based independent English language quarterly founded and run by a group of Palestinian and Israeli academics and journalists. ==Career== He was as an editor of New Outlook, the Israeli peace monthly and has written for The Guardian, The Nation, Los Angeles Times, L.A.

It was suggested by Thomas Allan in his book Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings that he could have been born at Long Edlingham, Ovingham or Shilbottle, and that his brother was the parish clerk at Earsdon in 1750. In fact, his name may have been originally spelt \\"Whittel\\". It has been suggested that he was christened at Kirkwhelpington on 10 September 1683. He was employed by an old miller, for whom he worked for years. He became, according to William Brockie quoting from Mackenzie's Northumberland (published 1825), and Thomas Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings, a disciple of \\"Bacchus\\", the Greek god of wine (Roman = Dionysus) and remained so for the rest of his life. == Later life == He died in East Shaftoe (near Killingworth) on 19 April 1736, and was buried at Hartburn. ==Legacy== He was a talented, versatile artist and some relics of his workmanship were to be seen at Belsay Castle, Hartburn, Ponteland, and other churches in Northumberland. In addition, his poems and songs were popular, particularly among the rural inhabitants of Northumberland. == Works == * The Insipids - or The Mistress with her Multitude of Man Servants appears in Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings. * Little Moody, Razor-setter appears in both Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings and is called \\"His Humorous Letter To Master Moody, the Razor-Setter\\" in Bell's Rhymes of Northern Bards 1812 * The Midford Galloway's Ramble appears in Bell's Rhymes of Northern Bards 1812 * Sawney Ogilby's Duel with his Wife appears in both Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings and Bell's Rhymes of Northern Bards 1812 * Short biography appears in both Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings and Bell's Rhymes of Northern Bards 1812 * Song - On William Carstairs, Schoolmaster – a song to a contemporary and sometime friend appears in both Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings and Bell's Rhymes of Northern Bards 1812 * An edition of his poetical works was published in 1815 by another poetry lover, long after his death, and which resulted in a short revival of his popularity. == See also == *Geordie dialect words *Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings *Rhymes of Northern Bards ==References== Category:English male poets Category:English songwriters Category:English artists Category:People from Newcastle upon Tyne (district) Category:1736 deaths Category:1683 births Category:Geordie songwriters Category:English male writers ","title":"Thomas Whittle (poet)"},{"id":"35900898","text":"TVP3 Lublin is one of the regional branches of the TVP, Poland's public television broadcaster.

It was celebrated on October 10, it honored former Kenyan President Daniel Moi.

Justice George Odunga in his ruling said the scrapping of the Moi Day holiday is an illegality and was in contravention of the law.
