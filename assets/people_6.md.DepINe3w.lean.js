Each time it takes place, it draws protests from campaigners, politicians and civil society ‚Äì particularly as many of the regimes invited to buy arms are also accused of human-rights abuses and breaching international humanitarian law. == DSEI's history == Between 1976 and 1991, the British Army Equipment Exhibition and the Royal Navy Equipment Exhibition were held on alternate years in Aldershot and Portsmouth respectively. Overseas delegations attended by invitation only. Despite having been at war with Iran for almost six years, a five-strong delegation from Iraq attended in 1986. In 1993 the two exhibitions were combined and held every other year until the British government decided to privatise the exhibition. Exhibitions company Spearhead launched the first DSEI, then known as Defence and Systems Equipment International, in 1999 at Chertsey in Surrey. In 2001 it moved to its current location at the ExCeL Exhibition Centre in London Docklands. DSEI's name was changed in 2009, replacing the word Systems with Security. === Current ownership === In April 2008, DSEI was acquired by Clarion Events. At the same time Clarion also acquired ITEC - a conference and exhibition dedicated to military simulation, training and education - and Latin American Aerospace and Defence. Clarion's organising of DSEI has made it a target of protests. In July 2017, anti-war campaigners wrote 'war starts here' outside the company's office. It was suggested by CAAT (Campaign Against Arms Trade) that former owners Reed Exhibitions' decision to sell followed substantial criticism both from healthcare professionals and academics, as well as criticism from campaigners, over the alleged immoral nature of the arms fair. == Political controversy == 2005 protests DSEI works closely with the Department of International Trade's arms-export promotion arm (DIT DSO) to invite foreign military delegations. Some of these delegations are accused of being undemocratic and abusing human- rights. In 2015, 61 countries were invited to DSEI. Of these, 14 were characterised by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index of having authoritarian regimes. Four (Colombia, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan) were also on the UK government's list of countries with wide-ranging human rights concerns. Six countries were characterised by the Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research as being \\"at war\\" at the time. Criticism of the DSEI arms fair has been led by Campaign Against Arms Trade but other NGOs such as Amnesty International have also criticised the fair - focusing on the presence of human-rights abusing regimes and on the sale of illegal torture equipment. In 2015, Amnesty International criticised the organiser's decision to bar human-rights researcher Oliver Sprague from the arms fair. Amnesty said it suspected \\"organisers wished to prevent human rights experts from detecting the presence of any illegal activity at the event, which has a chequered history\\". ===Politicians' views on DSEI=== Although the government has supported the event since its inception, opposition politicians have criticised it. In 2017, London Mayor Sadiq Khan called for it to be banned. He said: ‚ÄúThe Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) arms fair is not an event that I support. ExCeL is a commercial space for hire. I am opposed to London being used as a market place for the trade of weapons to those countries that contribute to human rights abuses.‚Äù. On the other hand, when Boris Johnson was Mayor of London, he said the arms fair should take place. ===Public's views on DSEI=== Polling of 2,000 UK adults, conducted by Opinium in 2015, showed that 43% believed that the government should not be involved in organising arms fairs like DSEI, with 19% believing that they should. When asked if the government should be involved in organising arms fairs which human rights abusers are invited to, 64% said 'no' and 9% said 'yes'. ===Illegal torture equipment=== At several DSEI arms fairs, organisers have faced criticism after torture equipment was found for sale at the fair. In 2015, two arms companies exhibiting at the fair (Tianjin Myway and Magforce International) advertised leg irons and electric batons. In 2007, another Chinese company called Famous Glory was found to be advertising banned leg irons in its brochure. In 2011, Amnesty International claimed that illegal torture equipment was again on display. ===Protests=== The event has attracted much attention from activist groups. In 2001, 2003, and 2005 were all targets of sizeable protests. Former London Mayor Ken Livingstone has been critical of the event and even the Metropolitan Police have spoken out about the cost of policing the event. In 2013 the London Mayor Boris Johnson supported the exhibition, which caused controversy with activists. 2013 Protestors targeted DSEI exhibitor Lockheed Martin by blocking the entrances to their Regent Street office. A networking dinner for DSEI attendees was also targeted by protesters who sat outside of the Troxy venue holding a banner which said: \\"Arms dealers here today - this is not OK!\\". 2015 DSEI 2019 During protests against the DSEI arms fair in 2015, eight people were arrested for blocking a road which led to the Excel Centre in order to stop tanks and armoured vehicles getting to the fair. The Crown Prosecution Service charged them with blocking a highway but the judge ruled that, by attempting to disrupt the arms fair, the protesters had been trying to prevent greater crimes such as genocide and torture. Defence witnesses in the case argued that the arms fair facilitated the repressive government of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs bombing campaign in Yemen and Turkey‚Äôs internal repression of its Kurdish population. District judge Angus Hamilton said: \\"‚Äú[There is] clear, credible and largely unchallenged evidence from the expert witnesses of wrongdoing at DSEI and compelling evidence that it took place in 2015. It was not appropriately investigated by the authorities. This could be inferred from the responses of the police officers, that they did not take the defendants‚Äô allegations seriously.‚Äù 2019 Campaigners disrupted the event by blockading entrances to the centre. Former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams condemned the 2019 fair, saying \\"The way much of the arms trade currently works continues to be a blot on the global moral landscape.\\" ==ReferencesExternal linksOfficial sites=== * Official DSEI Site * Clarion Events ===Anti-DSEI links=== * Stop The Arms Fair co-ordinates actions against the arms fair * Campaign Against Arms Trade Arms Fairs Campaign Category:Trade fairs in the United Kingdom Category:Arms fairs Category:Military industry in the United Kingdom ","title":"DSEI"},{"id":"2219173","text":"T600 may refer to: * Kenworth T600, a Class 8 truck built by Paccar * Tango T600, an ultra-narrow electric sports car * T-600, a fictional robot from Terminator series ","title":"T600"},{"id":"2219178","text":"Elijah Steele (November 13, 1817 ‚Äì June 27, 1883) was an early Northern California pioneer, jurist, legislator and Indian agent.Bio data Born near Albany, New York, Steele was raised in Oswego. After reading law in the office of Grant and Allen, he was admitted to the New York bar in 1840. He moved west in 1841, practicing law in both Illinois and Wisconsin. Steele was a member of the first Wisconsin constitutional convention of 1846, and briefly served in the Wisconsin State Senate.Members of the Wisconsin Legislature In 1850, Steele traveled to California, prospecting at Shasta, Scott River, Greenhorn and Yreka, among other claims. Before returning to the practice of law on a permanent basis during the mid-1850s, he engaged in a variety of occupations, including express company operator and driver, butcher and rancher. As a Republican Party leader, Steele campaigned actively for Abraham Lincoln in 1860 and was himself elected to the California State Assembly in 1867, where he served as chairman of the judiciary committee.Bio data Steele was elected a Superior Court judge for Siskiyou County in 1879 and held the office until his death. In 1865, he was the founder of the Siskiyou County Agricultural Society and served as its first president. During the early 1860s Steele was Agent of Indian Affairs for the Northern District of California, in which office he secured a treaty (known as the Valentine's Day Treaty) with the Modoc Indians which may well have averted the later Modoc War, had the treaty been ratified. During the war with the Modocs (1872‚Äì1873), Steele worked tirelessly to secure both peace and justice for the tribe, drawing accusations and recriminations, particularly from Oregon settlers who sought the executions of Modoc raiders. Steele was married three times, to Lucia Hart (1843‚Äì1853), to Louisa B. Hamblin (1858‚Äì1866) and to Louisa Lanze (1875‚Äì1883). Steele's first name is frequently erroneously reported as Elisha. This is due to an original misreading or misrecording of an early California voter list. This error first received wide circulation in Keith A. Murray's groundbreaking, The Modocs and Their War in 1959 and it has often been repeated. Steele's grave marker, in Yreka, California's Evergreen Cemetery, clarifies this discrepancy, as does his obituary in the Yreka Journal of June 30, 1883. ==Notes * # Category:People of the California Gold Rush Category:Wisconsin state senators Category:Members of the California State Assembly Category:California state court judges Category:United States Indian agents Category:People of the Modoc War Category:California lawyers Category:Illinois lawyers Category:New York (state) lawyers Category:Wisconsin lawyers Category:1817 births Category:1883 deaths Category:Politicians from Oswego, New York Category:People from Siskiyou County, California Category:People from Yreka, California Category:American lawyers admitted to the practice of law by reading law Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"Elijah Steele"},{"id":"2219180","text":"Brembilla may refer to: * Brembilla, a former commune in the province of Bergamo, in Lombardy, Italy ** Val Brembilla, a comune resulting from the 2014 merger of Brembilla and Gerosa * Alberto Brembilla, an Italian basketball player * Emiliano Brembilla, an Italian swimmer * Pierre Brembilla, a French association football player in the 1930s and 1940s ==See also== * Brambilla ","title":"Brembilla (disambiguation)"},{"id":"2219190","text":"Mark Nyman (born 14 October 1966) is an English professional Scrabble player originally from London, England and now a resident in Cheshire.

It is the single member of the monotypic genus Heteropterus. The species can be found in isolated populations in Europe and east across the Palearctic to Central Asia and Korea. It is endangered in the Netherlands. Specimen in southern France 200px 200px The length of the forewings is 15‚Äì18 mm. The butterfly is on the wing from June to August, depending on the location. The larvae feed on Eriophorum, Poa annua, Calamagrostis canescens, Brachypodium and Molinia species (including Molinia coerulea). As can be seen, the butterfly has a very distinctive and attractive underside but a drab upperside (which is rarely seen, as it usually settles with wings closed). This butterfly is very similar to the Chequered skipper, but they have their own attributes that allow them to be distinguished. The flight is just as distinctive and indeed provides immediate identification of the species: it appears to bounce through the air with little sense of direction, almost as if drunk.

He was born at Marradi in Tuscany to Alessandro and Iancinta Fabroni, of a banking family formerly of great fortune.Alexander Chalmers, The General Biographical Dictionary, (1814 ed.)s.v. \\"Fabroni, Angelo\\" has provided many details for this article. After studying with tutors and at Faenza, in 1750 he entered the Collegio Bandinelli in Rome, founded for the education of young Tuscans. His father having died that year, Piero Francesco Foggini took an interest in the young man's education. Fabroni became a priest. On the conclusion of his studies he continued his stay in Rome, and having been introduced to the celebrated Jansenist historian, Giovanni Gaetano Bottari, the librarian of the Corsini, he translated some meditative works of Pasquier Quesnel and received from Bottari a canonry at Santa Teresa in Trastevere. With Bottari's aid he presented a polished Latin life of Pope Clement XII Corsini, for which Cardinal Corsini defrayed the printing costs and made a handsome present to its author. Some time after this Fabroni was chosen to preach a Latin discourse in the pontifical chapel before Benedict XIV, with whom he made such a favorable impression that the pontiff settled on him an annuity, in the possession of which Fabroni was able to devote his whole time to study. Fabroni was asked to deliver the funeral oration in 1766 for James Stuart, the \\"Old Pretender\\" to the throne of Great Britain. He was intimate with Leopold Peter, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who appointed him prior of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence (1767); two years later, Fabroni took leave to pursue promises of preferment at Rome, made by Pope Clement XIV Ganganelli, in which he was disappointed. He was at work on the biographical dictionary of Italian men of letters for which he is remembered; the first volume was published in 1766, and was met with criticism, for the Jesuits disliked him on account of his Jansenist views. Besides his other literary labors he began at Pisa in 1771 a literary journal, Giornale de' letterati, which he continued till 1796, by which time 102 fascicles had appeared, many from his own pen. About 1772, funded by the Grand Duke, he made a journey to Paris, where he formed the acquaintance of Condorcet, Diderot, d'Alembert, Rousseau and most of the other Encyclop√©disteswhom he found to be leaders of impietyand other eminent Frenchmen of the day. He also spent four months in London, of which he also disapproved, where Benjamin Franklin fruitlessly urged him to go to America. He returned to Tuscany in 1773. Later he corresponded with Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor. He died in retirement among the Carthusians at Pisa. His principal works were: Vitae Italorum doctrina excellentium qui in saeculis XVII. et XVIII. floruerunt (20 vols., Pisa, 1778-1799, 1804-1805);\\"The Lives of Italians more outstanding in learning, who were active in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\\"; the last two volumes, published posthumously, contain a life of the author and some collected letters. Laurentii Medicei Magnifici Vita (2 vols., Pisa, 1784), which served as a basis for William Roscoe's Life of Lorenzo de' Medici; Leonis X pontificis maximi Vita (Pisa, 1797); and Elogi di Dante Alighieri, di Angelo Poliziano, di Lodovico Ariosto, e di Torquato Tasso (Parma, 1800). ==NotesReferences== * Category:1732 births Category:1803 deaths Category:People from Marradi Category:Italian biographers Category:Male biographers Category:Italian male non-fiction writers ","title":"Angelo Fabroni"},{"id":"2219223","text":"All the Way may refer to: ==Film and television== * All the Way, an Australian film of 1998 directed by Marque Owen * All the Way (2001 film), a film directed by Shi Runjiu * All the Way (film), a 2016 adaptation of Robert Schenkkan's play (see below) * All the Way (TV series), a 1988 Australian television series * \\"All the Way\\" (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), a television episode ==Literature== * All the Way (play), a 2012 play about President Lyndon B.

The tribe has 30,000 enrolled members. A population of 5,815 reside on the main reservation and another 2,516 reside on off-reservation trust land (as of the 2000 census).Turtle Mountain Reservation and Off-Reservation Trust Land, Montana/North Dakota/South Dakota United States Census Bureau It is federally recognized and Jamie Azure is the current Tribal Chairman elected for 2016 to 2018 term. ==History== Around the end of the eighteenth century, prior to the advent of white traders in the area, the formerly woodland-oriented Chippewa, who had been in what is now Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, moved out onto the Great Plains in pursuit of the bison and new beaver resources to hunt and trade. They successfully reoriented their culture to life on the plains, adopting horses, and developing the bison-hide tipi, the Red River cart, hard- soled footwear, and new ceremonial procedures. By around 1800, these Indians were hunting in the Turtle Mountain area of present-day North Dakota. For more than a century, as there was no international boundary, the Chippewa freely ranged in the areas that would become Manitoba, Canada and the United States including Minnesota, North Dakota and Montana, where they mingled with Cree and other tribes in the area. Running battles with the Dakota over territorial disputes, were finally settled in 1858 with the signing of the Sweet Corn Treaty which described the 11,000,000 acres of the Chippewa domain and provided for reparations. The agreement was signed by Mattonwakan, Chief of the Yanktons and La Terre Qui Purle, Chief of the Sisseton Band, Chief Wilkie (Narbexxa) of the Chippewa and witnessed by many members of both tribes. By 1863, the Chippewa domain encompassed nearly one-third of the land in what would become North Dakota. White settlers, wanting to take advantage of the Homestead Act petitioned Congress to open up the Red River valley for agriculture and to make treaties with the native peoples. On 2 October 1863, at the Old Crossing of the Red Lake River in Minnesota, Red Lake chiefs Monsomo (Moose Dung), Kaw-was-ke-ne-kay (Broken Arm), May-dwa-gum-on-ind (He That Is Spoken To) and Leading Feather, along with chiefs of the Pembina Band, Ase-anse (Little Shell II) and Miscomukquah (Red Bear) met with Alexander Ramsey and Ashley C. Morrill, commissioners for the Government, to negotiate the Treaty of Old Crossing. The government secured all 11-million acres obtained in the Sweet Corn Treaty to open it up to settlement. The Chippewa signed the treaty under duress. The 1869‚Äì1870 Red River Rebellion was a series of events that started when the Hudson's Bay Company transferred the North- Western Territory trapping franchise to Canada. As a result, Louis Riel and his M√©tis followers seized Fort Garry on 2 November 1869, and attempted to establish a provisional government for the territory of Manitoba. When Canadian troops arrived, Riel fled to the sanctuary of Montana, married, and became a US Citizen. In 1885, a group of M√©tis from Prince Albert, Canada asked for his assistance in settling grievances between the M√©tis and settlers. Riel drafted a petition, but fighting broke out, and he became wanted. Riel surrendered and was tried for treason. He was found guilty and hanged causing his followers to flee and seek refuge with the Turtle Mountain Chippewa. As the fur trade and buffalo hunting diminished available resources, the landless Turtle Mountain Chippewas, though recognized by the Government, found it difficult to ward off starvation. In an effort to provide them with a reservation, Congress approved purchase on 3 March 1873, of lands on the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota and attempted to relocate the tribe. The Chippewa refused to move and insisted on remaining in the Turtle Mountains. In June, 1884, an agreement had set aside a reservation twelve miles by six miles which was being occupied by the Turtle Mountain Band, but by 1891, again the US wanted a land cession. In 1891, Agent Waugh of Fort Totten, convened a committee of 16 full bloods and 16 mixed bloods to take a census of the Chippewa and set boundaries for a new reservation. Little Shell III wanted to obtain a 30 square mile tract at Turtle Mountain, but when that proposal was rejected, he and his followers abandoned the meeting. The McCumber Agreement was reached on 22 October 1892, which granted two townships within the traditional area ceding all other lands the Chippewa might possess in North Dakota. The land granted was inadequate to meet the needs of granting allotments to all tribal members, so negotiations continued. Finally in 1904, Article VI was added which provided that \\"All members of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewas who may be unable to secure land upon the reservation above ceded may take homesteads upon any vacant land belonging to the United States without charge, and shall continue to hold and be entitled to such share in all tribal funds, annuities, or other property, the same as if located on the reservations.\\" With this provision, the Chippewa agreed to the terms and the final agreement was ratified by Congress on 21 April 1904. In the decades after signing the McCumber agreement and the Great Depression the Chippewa adopted farming and gardening as a way of survival. They developed a Big Store in 1922 to sell goods and operated a creamery. They sold farm goods, chopped lumber, farm labor and medicinal herbs. Under the WPA, men gained training in construction jobs and women learned to sew and can goods. Congress approved the first charter of the Turtle Mountain Chippewa in 1932 and because of their successful endeavors and distrust of government programs, the tribe chose not to participate in the Indian Reorganization Act. The tribe filed numerous claims for a below market value settlement on the lands ceded in the McCumber Agreement. In 1934, Congress passed a law for the Indian Court of Claims to determine a settlement with the Chippewa, but it was vetoed by Franklin D. Roosevelt in May, 1934. As second attempt was also vetoed in June, 1934. Finally in 1946, with the establishment of the Indian Claims Commission, the tribe filed a petition in 1948. On 9 June 1964 an Act established their claim and a method of distribution of the judgment. On 1 August 1953, the US Congress passed House Concurrent Resolution 108 which called for the immediate termination of the Flathead, Klamath, Menominee, Potawatomi, and Turtle Mountain Chippewa, as well as all tribes in the states of California, New York, Florida, and Texas. Termination of a tribe meant the immediate withdrawal of all federal aid, services, and protection, as well as the end of reservations.US Statutes at Large 67:B132 Though termination legislation was introduced (Legislation 4. S. 2748, H.R. 7316. 83rd Congress. Termination of Federal Supervision over Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians), the law was not implemented. In 1954, at the Congressional hearings for the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, tribal Chairman Patrick Gourneau and a delegation spoke in Washington, DC. They testified that the group was not financially prepared, had high unemployment and poverty, suffered from low education levels, and termination would be devastating to the tribe. Based on their testimony, the Chippewa were dropped from the tribes to be terminated. ==Bands== As the fur trade dwindled, many of the bands from the Red, Rainy, Leech and Sandy Lakes areas who had settled near the Post, drifted back into Minnesota and North Dakota. One band, the Mikinak-wastsha-anishinabe, established their community in the Turtle Mountains. An 1849 letter from a Canadian priest, Father Belcourt, described the people of the Pembina Territory in 1849 as being from Red Lake, Reed Lake, Pembina and Turtle Mountain bands mixed with M√©tis, who far outnumbered the Chippewa. () A court case in 2003 ruled that the Little Shell Band of Chippewa Indians (of Montana) is a separate tribe, given the Little Shell Band's independent development since the 1890s and its relocation to Montana to have a separate government.Koke v. Little Shell Band of Chippewa of Montana, No. 01-888, April 2003, Montana Supreme Court, accessed 7 March 2012. The courts have recognized three independent units claiming the name Chippewa, and several unassociated members of that band.See FindLaw This case refers to cases of the Indian Claims Commission and United States Court of Claims, which can no longer be found online at their original sources, as the cases are old.An internet search for either: Turtle Mt.

The tribal resolution fracking ban was amended by the tribal council to direct the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to cancel oil and gas bids on 45,000 acres of tribal land that was scheduled to begin on December 14, 2011. The BIA cancelled the bids on December 9, 2011. ==Economy== The tribe has founded the Turtle Mountain Community College, one of numerous tribally controlled colleges in the United States. The tribe has established online, short-term installment loans as a business to serve underbanked Americans. The business has brought new employment opportunities and has generated financial support for other tribal business ventures and social programs for the reservation. The tribe established BlueChip Financial in 2012, which is based on the reservation in Belcourt, North Dakota and employs more than two dozen enrolled tribal members. BlueChip Financial is doing business under the Spotloan.com brand. The loans are only available online and the maximum loan value is $800, according to the company website. Since launch, the company has made 250,000 loans and operates only in the United States excluding selected states, as per listed on the website.

The Native American Financial Services Association (NAFSA) cites ‚ÄúTribal online lending provides a critical economic lifeline for sovereign tribes in remote areas, whether or not they engage in tribal government gaming. While many out-of-the-way tribal communities have developed gaming facilities as a way to create jobs and generate essential government revenues, remote reservations and gaming properties have been more severely impacted by the economic downturn.\\" There is high unemployment and poverty rates within the tribes and according to U.S. News & World Report and Pew Research ‚Äúmore than 1 in 4 native people live in poverty and labor force participation rate ‚Äì which measures the share of adults either working or looking for a job ‚Äì is 61.6 percent, the lowest for all race and ethnicity groups.‚Äù Delvin Cree, a writer with The Tribal Independent, criticized tribal lending in an opinion piece published on Indianz.com in February 2012.http://www.indianz.com/News/2012/004651.asp[\\"Predatory lending a cash cow in Indian country\\", Indianz.com, 17 February 2012, accessed 7 March 2012. On the other hand, The Wall Street Journal and other publications have written about how tribal online lending programs have brought much-needed economic development to tribes without many other economic development opportunities. Chairperson Sherry Treppa of the Habematolel Pomo of Upper Lake testified before the House Committee on Financial Services regarding tribal online small dollar lending programs becoming a vital part of many tribes‚Äô economic development strategies, providing much-needed jobs and revenue. She also argued that attempts to regulate tribes engaging in online lending is an attack on state and tribal sovereignty.https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hhrg-114-ba15-wstate- streppa-20160211.pdf In addressing tribal sovereignty and the relationship with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), Saba Bazzazieh argues that ‚Äúthe bureau has disregarded tribal sovereignty since its creation, the problem has recently reached an all-time high.‚Äù Additionally, ‚Äúthe bureau has demonstrated a patent misunderstanding of what tribal sovereignty actually means in practice, including the fundamentally important issue of preemption of state law.‚Äùhttps://www.georgetownlawtechreview.org/wp- content/uploads/2017/04/Nanini-1-GEO.-L.-TECH.-REV.-503.pdf In 2016, Gavin Clarkson authored an important analysis on the law and economics of tribal online lending programs, finding that the programs were lawful, called ‚ÄúOnline Sovereignty: The Law and Economics of Tribal Electronic Commerce.‚Äùhttp://www.jetlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Clarkson_Final.pdf In this analysis Clarkson also identified ways in which lending has supported the tribal economy to include employment, infrastructure, education, healthcare, tribal services and social services.

Prokeimena are not selected based on the personal preference of the priest, reader, or choir director. Rather, the Sunday and weekday prokeimena are taken from the Octoechos, using the particular tone of the day. Many feasts also have their own prokeimena. The basic pattern of a prokeimenon is for the reader to chant a single verse of the psalm or canticle (often announcing the tone as well). This is repeated as a refrain by the choir, as the Reader chants additional verses (exactly how many depends on local practice), followed by the choir singing the first verse in response. The Reader concludes the prokeimenon by chanting the first half of the first verse, and the choir then sings the second half. == Description == A prokeimenon (Greek Œ†œÅŒøŒ∫ŒµŒØŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒΩ, plural prokeimena; sometimes prokimenon/prokimena; lit. \\"that which precedes\\") is a psalm or canticle refrain sung responsorially at certain specified points of the Divine Liturgy or the Divine Office, usually to introduce a scripture reading.

The Reader concludes the prokeimenon by chanting the first half of the first verse, and the choir then sings the second half. Alternately, if a feast is being celebrated together with a Sunday liturgy, a verse of that feast's prokeimenon will often replace the final verse of the Sunday prokeimenon. In some traditions where a plain chant format is used, the prokeimenon may be chanted by a cantor. In this practice, the cantor will sing the refrained verse in the prescribed tone for the Sunday or Feastday along with the accompanying additional verses. This is usually done in alternation (refrain ‚Äì verse ‚Äì refrain ‚Äì verse ‚Äì refrain). == Example == The example given is the Sunday prokeimenon in Tone 8, assuming no additional feast. The verses are taken from Psalm 75 (Septuagint numbering). :Reader: \\"The prokeimenon is in the eighth tone: Pray and make your vows before the Lord our God!\\" :Choir:\\"Pray and make your vows before the Lord our God!\\" :Reader: \\"In Judah, God is known; His name is great in Israel!\\" :Choir:\\"Pray and make your vows before the Lord our God!\\" :Reader: \\"Pray and make your vows!\\" :Choir:\\"Before the Lord our God!\\" == Liturgical structure == In the Divine Liturgy, the prokeimenon always precedes the Epistle reading, after the singing of the Trisagion. At Vespers, the prokeimenon always follows the Entrance, whether or not there is an Old Testament reading to follow. Whenever there is a Gospel reading, whether at Matins or during a Moleben, it will be preceded by a prokeimenon. In Lent and Holy Week, at the Sixth Hour, a prokeimenon is also sung both before and after a reading from the books of Isaiah or Jeremiah. == Notes  References == * Category:Genres of Byzantine music Category:Byzantine Rite Category:Order of Mass ","title":"Prokeimenon"},{"id":"2219245","text":"The Mmabatho People's Party (MPP) was a political party in South West Africa, today's Namibia.

Because crosstrees are smaller, there is less need for alternatives to the futtock shrouds as a way past them. This sailor is about to climb out round the edges of the crosstrees using the futtock shrouds. Futtock shrouds are rope, wire or chain links in the rigging of a traditional square rigged ship. They run from the outer edges of a top downwards and inwards to a point on the mast or lower shrouds, and carry the load of the shrouds that rise from the edge of the top. This prevents any tendency of the top itself to tilt relative to the mast. ==Climbing a ship's rigging== In the most traditional ships, the futtock shrouds can be used to gain access to the tops. Sailors ascend ratlines on the ordinary shrouds until nearly at the top, then transfer to the futtock shrouds which will be reaching upwards and outwards above them. Using the futtock shrouds involves climbing the underside of an overhanging rope at about 45 degrees. Futtock shrouds may or may not have ratlines. As well as climbing the futtock shrouds, most ships also allowed access to the top through the \\"lubber's hole\\" at the tip of the ordinary ratlines. However, this was generally scorned by experienced sailors, and reserved for those on their first few trips aloft. Any traditionally- rigged ship will have futtock shrouds, but on some modern ones they are strictly for structural purposes, with climbing forbidden. These ships may also dispense with lubbers' holes, and instead opt for a \\"Jacob's ladder\\" that descends from the edge of the top to the ratlines vertically, rather than overhanging like the futtock shrouds. ==Futtock band== In the mid-nineteenth century the futtock band was introduced, being a metal collar fitted to the mast below the top, to which the lower point of the futtock shrouds is attached. Before this the futtock shrouds were attached to the lower shrouds that rose directly to the top. In this arrangement lower shrouds must support a greater load, requiring the use of catharpins to provide bracing between port and starboard shrouds. ==Futtock (frame)== In the construction of a wooden-hulled ship, the futtocks are the separate pieces of timber which compose the frame of the ship. There are four futtocks (component parts of the rib), and occasionally five, to a ship. Those next to the keel are called 'ground-futtocks', or navel-futtocks, and the rest are termed 'upper futtocks'. The word itself is derived from a contraction of 'foot hook', indicating their role in providing a secure framework to a ship.

The second of six children born to her parents, she was the first of their children to survive infancy. She had an elder sister, Caterina Charlotte (1691-1696) and four younger sisters, Elisabetta Charlotte (1698-1702), Margherita Camilla (1700‚Äì1758), Maria Devota (1702-1703) and Maria Paolina Theresa Devota Grimaldi (1708‚Äì1726). Because she had no brothers, Louise Hippolyte became the heiress to the throne of Monaco. Her father decided, with the permission of Louis XIV, that her future husband should assume the surname of Grimaldi and rule Monaco jointly with her. On 20 October 1715, at the age of eighteen, she married Jacques Fran√ßois Goyon, Count de Matignon, after his family had proposed him as a candidate. His candidacy was supported by King Louis XIV, who wanted to consolidate French influence in Monaco. Prior to this, Louise Hippolyte's father was eager to wed his daughter to a Grimaldi cousin. This marriage did not materialise due to the poor finances of the Grimaldis at the time. Louise Hippolyte and Jacques had nine children. Her husband preferred to stay in Versailles instead of Monaco, where he had several mistresses. After the death of her father, Louise Hippolyte traveled from Paris to Monaco on 4 April 1731 and received an enthusiastic reception from the populace. When Jacques joined her a little while later, the reception was much colder. At the end of 1731, Louise Hippolyte died of smallpox. Her husband neglected the affairs of Monaco and had to leave the country in May 1732. He abdicated in favor of their son, Honor√©, the next year. Her husband remained a widower, despite a rich dowry offered to him by the Duchess of Maine for the hand of her unattractive daughter, Mademoiselle du Maine, a granddaughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. ==Issue== * Antoine Charles Marie (16 December 1717 ‚Äì 4 February 1718), Marquis des Baux and Count de Matignon. * Charlotte Th√©r√®se Nathalie (19 March 1719 ‚Äì 1790), nun at the Convent of Visitation at Paris. * Honor√© III Camille L√©onor (10 November 1720 ‚Äì 21 March 1795), successor of his parents. * Charles Marie Auguste (1 January 1722 ‚Äì 24 August 1749), Count de Carlad√©s and de Matignon. * Jacques (9 June 1723 ‚Äì June 1723). * Louise Fran√ßoise (15 July 1724 ‚Äì 15 September 1729), Mademoiselle des Baux. * Fran√ßois Charles (4 February 1726 ‚Äì 9 December 1743), Count of Thorigny. * Charles Maurice (14 May 1727 ‚Äì 18 January 1798), Count de Valentinois; married on 10 November 1749 to Marie Christine Chr√©tienne de Rouvrois; no issue. * Marie Fran√ßoise Th√©r√©se (20 July 1728 ‚Äì 20 June 1743), Mademoiselle d'Estouteville. ==Ancestors== Category:Princes of Monaco Category:Hereditary Princesses of Monaco Category:House of Grimaldi Category:Monegasque princesses Category:Burials at the Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate, Monaco Category:17th-century French people Category:18th-century French people Category:1697 births Category:1731 deaths Category:Deaths from smallpox ","title":"Louise Hippolyte"},{"id":"2219252","text":"Operation Artemis, formally European Union Force (EUFOR) Democratic Republic of the Congo, was a short-term European Union-led UN-authorised military mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the Ituri conflict. ARTEMIS is considered the first military operation led by the EU, the first autonomous EU operation, the first rapid response mission of the EU, first operation outside Europe, first operation applying the principle of the framework nation and first example of \\"relay operation\\", conducted in cooperation between the EU and the United Nations.T√ºrke 2008, p. 4T√ºrke 2016, p. 53-106 The deployment of EUFOR troops quickly decreased the conflict's intensity. It marked the first autonomous EU military mission outside Europe and an important milestone in development of the European Security and Defence Policy. ==Background== During the Second Congo War, the Ituri conflict occurred in the Ituri Region alongside Lake Albert and the Ugandan border. The Ituri conflict was fought between two non-governmental informally organised ethnic groups, the Lendu and Hema, that had caused the deaths of thousands of people by 2003. ===2003 Ituri Conflict fighting=== In 2003, Lendu and Hema militias were battling for control of the town after Ugandan troops withdrew after the signing of a peace agreement, and Congolese police fled. During discussions regarding the deployment of an international force, UN Security Council diplomats were mindful of a repetition of the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Following a series of massacres, including the Bogoro attack of February 2003, and reports by the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) of serious human rights abuses, the Security Council adopted the Resolution 1484 on 30 May 2003 and authorised the deployment of a French led Interim Multinational Emergency Force (IMEF) to the regional capital of Bunia. ===UN Observer Mission and Withdrawal of Ugandan Troops=== In the beginning of 2003, the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) observer teams present in that country since 1999, monitored serious combats and human rights violations in Ituri province where the Ituri conflict had been unfolding for the previous four years. The withdrawal of 7,000 Ugandan troops in April 2003 led to a deteriorating security situation in the Ituri region, endangering the peace process in DRC. In April 2003, 800 Ugandan soldiers were deployed in Bunia and one observer died in a mine explosion. In May 2003, two military observers were killed by a militia. == Intervention == The UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for establishing and deploying a temporary multi-national force to the area until the weakened MONUC mission could be reinforced. On 30 May 2003, the Security Council adopted the Resolution 1484 authorising the deployment of an Interim Multinational Emergency Force (IMEF) to Bunia with a task to secure the airport, protect internally displaced persons in camps and the civilians in the town. The French Government had already shown interest in leading the operation. It soon broadened to an EU-led mission with France as the \\"Lead nation\\" providing the bulk of the personnel (900 of the 1400 troops) and complemented by contributions from both EU and non-EU nations. The force was supported by French aircraft based at N'Djamena and Entebbe airfields. A small Swedish Special Forces group (SSG and FJS) was also added. * Military forces: Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Greece, South Africa, Sweden, United Kingdom, * Headquarters staff: Austria, Cyprus, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Germany Operation Artemis was launched on 12 June and the IMEF completed its deployment in the following three weeks. The force was successful in stabilising the situation in Bunia and enforcing the UN presence in the DRC. On 1 September 2003, responsibility for the security of the region was handed over to the MONUC mission. The number of authorised personnel in the MONUC mission was previously extended in Resolution 1493. Following the rapid deployment of about 1800 troops to the region in June 2003, Bunia was secured but massacres continued in the countryside. On 1 September 2003, responsibility for the security of the region was handed over to the MONUC mission. == Milestone == By December 2003, one of major warring parties in the region, the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) had split and fighting in the region decreased significantly.

Between 1904 and 1920 this was housed in the Wimbledon Technical Institute in Gladstone Road. It became independent in 1930 and moved to Merton Hall Road in 1940. Theatre design was taught from 1932, and became a department in 1948. BA courses were introduced from 1974, and MA courses from 1984.

The brand is produced at the Stevens Point Brewery in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. ==History== The brewery was founded by Minneapolis attorney James Page in 1986. It was located on Quincy Street in Northeast Minneapolis, in an aging industrial warehouse building. The brewery's infrastructure was cobbled together from secondhand equipment. Page never exceeded more than about 1500 barrels per year of production until it was sold to new owners in the mid 1990s. In addition to operating a brewery, James Page was also a home brewing retailer. It operated a retail store out of the company's tap room and had a mail order shipping/catalog operation. In October 1995, James Page sold the brewery to a group of investors with a background in food marketing. Page continued to operate a home brew supply company until 1998 under the name \\"James Page Brewing\\", although there was no longer any tie to the brewery. The new owners of the brewery, led by President David Anderson, thoroughly re- invented the brand. They created a fictional character to personify \\"James Page\\", who bore little resemblance to the founder of the company; he was a rugged American frontiersman. They also stopped the practice of trucking the beer to distant bottling lines. Instead, they produced the bottled product as a contract brew at regional breweries (Minnesota Brewing Company in St. Paul, and then Stroh's in St. Paul). The draught product continued to be brewed at the Quincy Street brewery. In 1998, Page became one of the first American craft breweries to package its beer in cans. The canned product was brewed and packaged under contract at the August Schell Brewing Company in New Ulm, Minnesota. It won a contract with Northwest Airlines to feature the canned beer on certain domestic flights. Despite a more aggressive marketing push, the brewery's new management was not able to turn a profit. The James Page Brewing Company suffered from an identity crisis: although the Quincy Street brewery produced beer for its draught accounts, the bottled product was a contract brew. The beer in the bottles was not the same product as the beer in the kegs, and this did not help its reputation among beer aficionados. As a result, Page management made the acquisition of a bottling line a top priority during the late 1990s and early 2000s. In 2000, James Page had a stock offering, and the first $400,000 was specifically earmarked for the bottling line.Modern Brewery Age, October 4, 1999. It advertised the stock offering on six-packs, soliciting investments as small as $285. The company announced that it had successfully raised the maximum $855,000 from over 1,000 investors in January, 2000.Modern Brewery Age, January 17, 2000. But the money was never used to fund expansion; instead it was used to lower the company's debt burdens, and the bottling line was never built. In 2002, the brewery was shut down. The company continued to contract-brew beer at other regional breweries. In 2005, the company's final asset was liquidated when the Page brand name was purchased by the Stevens Point Brewery in Steven's Point, Wisconsin. ==Products== James Page's most popular beers in the early period included Private Stock (an amber lager), Boundary Waters Lager (possibly the first commercially-produced beer made with wild rice), Boundary Waters Bock, Burly Brown Ale, and Mill City Wheat. James Page Private Stock and Boundary Waters Lager were available in six-packs year-round. ==See also== * List of defunct breweries in the United States ==References *James Page Brewing Company Category:Defunct companies based in Wisconsin Category:Defunct brewery companies of the United States ","title":"James Page Brewing Company"},{"id":"2219263","text":"Limestone formations east of Loch Ard Gorge The Shipwreck Coast of Victoria, Australia stretches from to Cape Otway to Port Fairy, a distance of approximately 130 km.

The word sissi, first attested in the modern meaning \\"patrolman, partisan, spy\\" in 1787, comes to Finnish from Slavic and refers either to a forest bandit or his yew bow.http://www.sissoset.net/aineisto/nimi.htm The Finnish Army trained Sissi units to conduct long range reconnaissance patrols, gather intelligence from concealed observation posts, raid enemy installations (especially supply depots), conduct road side ambushes and pursue and destroy enemy special forces units. In wartime, an unspecified number of reservists were to be assigned to Sissi battalions and would deploy and operate as small groups up to company size. They were meant to either infiltrate through enemy lines to their rear, or stay behind and covertly operate against enemy forces in their area of responsibility even after regular friendly troops had been forced to retreat. Sissi battalions were part of Finnish Army \\"local troops\\", unlike the j√§ger and armored brigades meant for operational use. In official Finnish military parlance, the word \\"sissi\\" has been largely phased out. For example, the Sissi company of the Lappi Border Guard of the Finnish Border Guard was renamed to \\"Border Jaeger Company\\" in 1994. The conscripts serving in the unit were concurrently renamed to Border Jaegers.Lapin rajavartiosto  Organisaatio  Rajaj√§√§k√§rikomppania Similarly, Finnish Army sissi units are now called \\"reconnaissance\\" units, and the personnel serving in them called \\"tiedustelija\\", \\"reconnaissance man\\". A notable exception are the sissiradisti or Sissi signalists.Sissiradisti ==History== Wars between Russia and Finland have a long tradition of Finnish sissi warfare. Famous sissi leaders have included Pekka Vesainen (c. 1540‚Äì1627), Tapani L√∂fving (1689‚Äì1777, fought during the Greater Wrath), and Olli Tiainen (1770‚Äì1833, fought during the Finnish War). Before the hostilities of Winter War, the Finnish Borderguard formed 25 Independent Battalions (Erillinen Pataljoona) from local reservists along the border area. After the outbreak of hostilities, a further five Sissi Battalions (Sissipataljoona) were formed from \\"auxiliary personnel\\". These battalions, especially those of the latter type, were below their nominal strength in both men and weaponry. These units proved to be effective in using motti tactics in their native area with light infantry weapons and skis.Data of the Finnish Army in the Winter War, Part 1 In the Continuation War the ad hoc Sissi Battalions were replaced by Independent Battalions. For example, the 4th Independent Battalion was directly under the command of Supreme Headquarters doing LRRP and raiding missions deep inside Soviet area. In the Battle of Ilomantsi, soldiers of the 4th disrupted the supply lines of the Soviet artillery, preventing effective fire support. In the Ladoga Karelia area of operations the length of the front, the absence of roads and a lack of troops prevented continuous front lines during the trench warfare period. Both armies used a chain of fortified field bases separated by the wilderness, monitoring and controlling the gaps with patrols. Both Finns and Soviets launched raids and recon patrols into enemy territory. Battles were short clashes of lightly armed infantry groups from squadron to battalion in size, with little chance of support or reinforcements.Juutilainen, Leskinen: Jatkosodan Pikkuj√§ttil√§inen, http://www.wsoy.fi, After the Second World War, Sissi units were decommissioned and Sissi training was officially discontinued, although many units gave Sissi training for their reconnaissance units. In the beginning of the 1960s, the Paratrooper School was established at Utti, and both infantry and border guard units established Sissi training companies thereafter.Puolustusvoimat: Historia ja perinteet ==Famous sissi troops== * Ilmari Honkanen, officer in 4th Independent Battalion (ErP 4).

After the Finno- Soviet ceasefire he returned to Waffen-SS because he did not believe that Soviets would actually follow the ceasefire agreement.

Sissi forces were not irregular guerrilla or militia forces. They were part of the regular FDF troops trained for operations behind enemy lines. Like most of the Finnish Defence Forces, Sissi battalions are composed of reservists. Their closest foreign equivalents are the Swedish Armed Forces J√§gare troops. Despite the phasing out of the term in official use, \\"sissi\\" continues to be used in both in Finnish military slang and in everyday speech. The word \\"sissi\\" can also be used as a description is a person of extraordinary stamina (or Sisu) or as an adjective. It is also used as an umbrella term for all unconventional or \\"in- the-field\\" military applications. For example, MREs are known as \\"Sissi rations\\"Varusmiesten sissimuona tulee kokonaan ulkomailta ‚Äì n√§kkileip√§ valmistetaan Saksassa. Maaseudun tulevaisuus. 2016.; improvised and/or temporary repair to any equipment are called \\"sissiviritys\\" (literally \\"sissi fix\\" or \\"sissi patch\\") and improvised booby-traps, such as firearms rigged to fire at doorway of a building once someone opens the door, may be called \\"sissij√§yn√§\\", literally \\"sissi prank\\". \\"Sissi weather\\" (Sissin s√§√§) refers to the worst possible weather conditions, for sissi soldiers prefer these for their operations, since bad weather tends to distract enemy soldiers (any normal soldier tends to think about getting to shelter as soon as possible when bad weather strikes) and hide any noise caused by sissis. ==Training== The training of the Sissi troops was not centralized, but they were historically trained in several Finnish Defence Force brigades as well as in the Sissi companies of the Finnish Border Guard. Reserve officers for all Sissi troops were trained at Reserviupseerikoulu. The Sissi conscripts were given training in survival, signals and demolitions, extended small arms training as well as training in advanced escape & evasion techniques and ambush tactics. Those unable to cope for either physical or psychological reasons were either given deferments or transferred to a regular infantry training. ==Weapons and equipment== While the Sissi troops were not motorized or equipped with heavy weapons or equipment, they were primarily issued the same uniforms and weaponry as the regular infantry. Distinctive personal equipment used by Sissi were Savotta \\"Para J√§ger\\" backpacks used because of extended hikes,Finn-Savotta Oy - SavottaLJKE camouflage paints and personal camouflage nets. Sissi units had fewer crew-served weapons and more sniper rifles than regular infantry. Mines were an important part of the Sissi tactic of ambushing enemy convoys. They were also used to discourage pursuit after raids and served as defences of bivouac. Sissi training included construction of improvised explosive devices, as well as boobytraps. Sissi units had at their disposal a wide variety of land mines and other explosive devices, such as: *Track Mine TM 65 77 (AT mine) *Pipe Explosion Device 68 95 (AP Explosion Device) Puolustusvoimat: Kalustoesittely sometimes called \\"ovikello\\", \\"doorbell.\\" *Anti-personnel mine 65 98 (AP mine)Puolustusvoimat: Kalustoesittely *Side Explosion Device 87 (AT Mine)Puolustusvoimat: Kalustoesittely *Side Explosion Device 81 (AT Mine)Puolustusvoimat: Kalustoesittely *VP 88 Claymore (AP Explosion Device )Puolustusvoimat: Kalustoesittely *VP 84 Claymore (AP Explosion Device )Puolustusvoimat: Kalustoesittely *Mortar 81mm 81 KRH 71 Y (mortar) both firing and producing guided-launched antipersonnel improvised charges ==Modern successors of the Sissi troops== The Finnish Defence Forces no longer has any sissi companies as part of its peace time training organization. The last sissi company was renamed to a reconnaissance company in 2015 and disbanded completely in 2016.Marko Siirtola Valmiusyksikk√∂ kaukopartiomarssilla perinteit√§ kunnioittaen, Etupy√∂r√§ 2019, 2019 The status of sissi troops as part of the wartime FDF is less clear, as there is little available public information. The National Defense University of Finland has not published any thesis or paper in the 21st century where sissi units and tactics are mentioned.http://www.doria.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/96810/Palokangas%20%28net%29.pdf?sequence=2 The FDF's reformed land warfare doctrine is a distributed fighting doctrine which requires every soldier in the army to understand basic principles of asymmetric tactics.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foipv7iVP-c The FDF continues to provide reconnaissance (formerly sissi) training in many major training formations, where they emphasize reconnaissance, forward observation and fire control but this training no longer leans towards special tactics, weapons, sabotage and woodland area fighting skills. However, the FDF paratroopers of the Utti Jaeger Regiment are trained in woodland area fighting, survival skills, unconventional methods and asymmetric tactics though the major role is geared more towards long range reconnaissance and special operations. The Finnish Border Guard, under the ministry of interior, has renamed its Sissi companies to Border Jaeger companies and has adopted the term (Special) Border Jaeger as a replacement for the term Sissi. These units are trained to operate behind the enemy lines with asymmetric tactics and unconventional weapons and methods as well as to conduct long term operational reconnaissance and aggressive short term reconnaissance and sabotage. Aside from classical Sissi training, the training also includes peacetime operational methods and the responsibilities of the Border Guard i.e. border control, patrol, and tracking and catching illegal intruders. ==See also== * Artillery Brigade (Finnish Army) * Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol * Commando ==References * FDF's Reformed Land Warfare Doctrine (video) Category:Military units and formations of Finland Category:Army reconnaissance units and formations fi:Sissisota ","title":"Sissi (Finnish light infantry)"},{"id":"2219280","text":"Spy Story may refer to: * Spy Story (novel), a 1974 spy novel by Len Deighton * Spy Story (film), a 1976 British espionage film, based on the novel ","title":"Spy Story"},{"id":"2219283","text":"RHLI may refer to: * The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment) * Acyl-homoserine-lactone synthase, an enzyme ","title":"RHLI"},{"id":"2219299","text":"Cyclophilins (CYPs) are a family of proteins named after their ability to bind to ciclosporin (cyclosporin A), an immunosuppressant which is usually used to suppress rejection after internal organ transplants. They are found in all domains of life. These proteins have peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity, which catalyzes the isomerization of peptide bonds from trans form to cis form at proline residues and facilitates protein folding. Cyclophilin A is a cytosolic and highly abundant protein. The protein belongs to a family of isozymes, including cyclophilins B and C, and natural killer cell cyclophilin-related protein. Major isoforms have been found within single cells, including inside the Endoplasmic reticulum, and some are even secreted. == Mammalian cyclophilins == Human genes encoding proteins containing the cyclophilin domain include: * PPIA, PPIB, PPIC, PPID, PPIE, PPIF, PPIG, PPIH * PPIL1, PPIL2, PPIL3, PPIL4, PPIAL4, PPIL6 * PPWD1 ===Cyclophilin A === Cyclophilin A + HIV peptid (green), Human. Cyclophilin A (CYPA) also known as peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA), which is found in the cytosol, has a beta barrel structure with two alpha helices and a beta-sheet. Other cyclophilins have similar structures to cyclophilin A. The cyclosporin-cyclophilin A complex inhibits a calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin, the inhibition of which is thought to suppress organ rejection by halting the production of the pro- inflammatory molecules TNF alpha and interleukin 2. Cyclophilin A is also known to be recruited by the Gag polyprotein during HIV-1 virus infection, and its incorporation into new virus particles is essential for HIV-1 infectivity. ===Cyclophilin D=== Cyclophilin D (PPIF, note that literature is confusing, the mitochondrial cyclophilin is encoded by the PPIF gene), which is located in the matrix of mitochondria, is only a modulatory, but may or may not be a structural component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. The pore opening raises the permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane, allows influx of cytosolic molecules into the mitochondrial matrix, increases the matrix volume, and disrupts the mitochondrial outer membrane. As a result, the mitochondria fall into a functional disorder, so the opening of the pore plays an important role in cell death. Cyclophilin D is thought to regulate the opening of the pore because cyclosporin A, which binds to CyP-D, inhibits the pore opening. However, mitochondria obtained from the cysts of Artemia franciscana, do not exhibit the mitochondrial permeability transition pore ==Clinical significanceDiseases=== Overexpression of Cyclophilin A has been linked to poor response to inflammatory diseases, the progression or metastasis of cancer, and aging. ===Cyclophilins as drug targets=== Cyclophilin inhibitors, such as cyclosporin, are being developed to treat neurodegenerative diseases.J&J; targets degenerative diseases in cyclophilin inhibitor partnership.

The phone entry (or entries) should supplement or complement written (such as wallet, bracelet, or necklace) information or indicators. The programme was conceived in the mid-2000s and promoted by British paramedic Bob Brotchie in May 2005.Bob's idea has global impact (Cambridge Evening News) It encourages people to enter emergency contacts in their mobile phone address book under the name 'ICE'. Alternatively, a person can list multiple emergency contacts as 'ICE1', 'ICE2', etc. The programme has been criticised by some emergency responders, and the hoaxbusters site. ==Overview== Following research carried out by Vodafone that showed that fewer than 25% of people carry any details of who they would like telephoned following a serious accident, a campaign encouraging people to do this was started in May 2005 by Bob Brotchie of the East of England Ambulance Service in the United Kingdom. The idea has taken off since 7 July 2005 London bombings. When interviewed on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme on 12 July 2005, Brotchie said: > \\"I was reflecting on some difficult calls I've attended, where people were > unable to speak to me through injury or illness and we were unable to find > out who they were. I discovered that many people, obviously, carry mobile > phones and we were using them to discover who they were. It occurred to me > that if we had a uniform approach to searching inside a mobile phone for an > emergency contact then that would make it easier for everyone.\\" Brotchie also urged mobile phone manufacturers to support the campaign by adding an ICE heading to phone number lists of all new mobile phones. With this additional information and medical information, first responders can access this information from the victim's phone in the event of an emergency. In the event of a major trauma, it is critical to have this information within the golden hour, which can increase the chances of survival. ==Criticism== While some emergency responders lauded the suggestionhttps://web.archive.org/web/20080308164750/http://blog.panorama.it/italia/2007/03/14/il- capo-del-118-di-milano-si-al-numero-ice/ others have criticised ithttps://web.archive.org/web/20070321232532/https://www.tio.ch/aa_pagine_comuni/articolo_interna.asp?idarticolo=314246&idtipo;=3 In Germany, the In Case of Emergency concept has been criticised for many reasons:, in German *Medical service personnel on site normally do not have the time to contact relatives. Information stored in a phone is thus useless for medical care prior to hospital. *Contacting relatives of a seriously injured person is a sensitive task that is not carried out by telephone in the first place. It is recommended that one carries contact information and relevant medical information in writing inside one's wallet, and not rely on ICE contacts as a primary means of identification. Other problems include language-dependent text (ICE in English, ECU in French, etc. etc.), the difficulty of accessing locked, discharged, or broken phones, differences among mobile models requiring training of emergency responders. Many smartphone models have dedicated ICE contact information functionality either built into the operating system, or available as an app. Saving duplicate phone numbers on a phone without dedicated ICE functionality may cause the ICE and regular contacts to be combined, or cause the caller ID to fail for incoming calls from a close friend or relative. (To avoid this, some use the 'tel:' URI scheme to put the phone number in the ICE contact's 'home page' field.) A 'competing proposal' exists called E.123, which is also an official ITU-T standard. The hoaxbuster site classified the claims of the programme as \\"partly true, partly false\\". ==Locked phones== For security purposes, many mobile phone owners now lock their mobiles, requiring a passcode or PIN to be entered in order to access the device. This hinders the ability of first responders to access the ICE phone list entry. In response to this problem, many device manufacturers have provided a mechanism to specify some text to be displayed while the mobile is in the locked state. The owner of the phone can specify their 'In Case of Emergency' contact, and also a 'Lost and Found' contact. For example, BlackBerry mobiles permit the 'Owner' information to be set in the Settings ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Owner menu item. Android users running Android Nougat (Android 7.0) or higher also have the ability to programme emergency information and contact details accessible by others through the emergency call screen when the device is locked. Emergency contacts can be added to iPhone lock screens with the iOS Health application, and accessed by tapping or swiping to the Emergency dialler, where calls to 911 or another pre- specified number can be made, and the Medical ID button is displayed as well. When accessing this Medical ID, the user's name, health information, allergies and medications can be listed, along with the ability to directly contact listed emergency contacts. Alternatively, some handsets provide access to a list of ICE contacts directly from the 'locked' screen. There are also smartphone 'apps' (applications) that allow custom ICE and emergency information to be displayed on the 'locked' screen.

It was established in 1993, and is a part of Brigade Nord and stationed at Rena, Hedmark. The battalion consists of five companies/squadrons. ==History== In 1993 it was a motorised infantry unit, tasked as an Immediate Reaction Force with the Norwegian Army, stationed at Heistadmoen in southern Norway, manned mainly by conscripts. It served in Bosnia, and by 2002, all the enlisted soldiers had two and three-year contracts of enlistment and the unit had no more conscripts. The battalion was moved to a new camp at Rena and converted to mechanised infantry. Presented with its new colours in 2002, the Telemark Battalion was operational on 1 July 2003.

In addition, the Telemark Battalion frequently trains with the rest of the Norwegian Army High Reaction Force. This is a composite unit made up of the Telemark Battalion, as well as enlisted personnel from support capabilities, ranging from artillery to military police. The Telemark Battalion was one of the infantry battalions assigned to the NATO Response Force during the NRF-4 rotation from January to July 2005; the others were Regiment Johan Willem Friso and Regiment Van Heutsz of the Dutch Army and Fallschirmj√§gerbataillon 373 of the German Army. Telemark Battalion is the primary source of international contributions from the Norwegian Army. The battalion has almost constantly been involved in the ISAF operation in Afghanistan since 2003. ==Incidents in Afghanistan== Since the summer of 2009, there have been several instances of soldiers from the unit spray painting a Punisher skull (in part inspiredhttp://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10036791 by the character from comic books and movie ‚Äì the Punisher) on houses and property belonging to Afghans whom soldiers suspected of having ties to the insurgency. The purported purpose was to \\"send a message\\",Verdens Gang 2011-11-14 p.47 to leaders of the insurgency, that the Norwegian soldiers would not allow them to continue their offensive. In September 2010, Verdens Gang reported that some soldiers were still using a Punisher skull that had been prohibited by the leadership of Norway's military.http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10036791 \\"FORBUDT: Til tross for gjentatte forbud fra forsvarsledelsen, fortsetter noen av soldatene fra Telemark bataljon √• bruke dette merket, d√∏dninghodet ¬´The Punisher¬ª.

Since its initial release in 1986, Zodiac has sold 4 million copies worldwide. Robert Graysmith Was a Cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle Until the Zodiac Case Drew Him In. WashingtonPost.com. Retrieved 2000-06-11. Graysmith was a cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle and later also wrote Zodiac Unmasked. ==Synopsis== This book chronicles the history of the self-named \\"Zodiac\\" killer who was active in the 1960s and 70s in California from first hand details covered by Robert Graysmith's investigative efforts to unmask the \\"Zodiac\\" killer. The novel describes the investigations of the many law enforcement branches such as the LAPD, the FBI, the CIA , etc., that worked on the case and other murders that the \\"Zodiac\\" had proclaimed he committed, including the 1966 Cheri Jo Bates stabbing. Later chapters deal with Graysmith's many theories on the case, and the book eventually cites two possible suspects (who are given pseudonyms), Bob Starr and Donald Andrews, and details some of the circumstantial evidence against them. Graysmith received assistance from police departments that fell within the jurisdictions of the murders, and especially from Inspector Dave Toschi from the San Francisco Police Department, who had worked the Zodiac case.Graysmith, Robert. 1986. Zodiac St. Martin's Press Although the case was never solved, there were instances where solid evidence was held among multiple suspects, even after the Zodiac murders had stopped. ==Origin of the book== Robert Graysmith was a cartoonist working for The San Francisco Chronicle in the 1960s when the Zodiac murders started. The Zodiac sent letters to The Chronicle which he urgently wanted published in the paper. The letters included evidence that he was in fact the Zodiac; while committing one of his crimes, the \\"Zodiac\\" cut a piece of bloody cloth from one of his victims and attached it to several of his hand written letters to disable the thought of a fake \\"Zodiac\\" writing to the San Francisco Chronicle. Graysmith saw the letters arriving at The Chronicle and became intrigued. For years the cartoonist kept his own scrapbook of evidence, from which he independently attempted to determine the Zodiac's identity. When asked why he began working on the book, Graysmith replied, \\"I saw it going into obscurity. Nobody is sharing all the different jurisdictions, and all this information. What if I as a private citizen went around and got all this information?\\" This led to a 10-year period to collect information, and eventually the book was published in 1986 after a number of delays. ==Film== The film adaptation Zodiac (2007) is roughly based on Graysmith's books, Zodiac (1986) and Zodiac Unmasked (2002). The film follows the work of Graysmith as a cartoonist in 1969 aiding the authorities in figuring the identity of the infamous Zodiac killer. ==References== Category:1986 non-fiction books Category:Non-fiction crime books Category:Books about the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Crimes in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Cultural depictions of the Zodiac Killer Category:Non-fiction books about serial killers Category:Books adapted into films ","title":"Zodiac (true crime book)"},{"id":"2219358","text":"Beaumont Leys is a suburb and electoral ward in north-western Leicester, England.

He was drafted in the 10th round, 200th overall in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft by the New Jersey Devils. Schwab won the 2003 Stanley Cup with the New Jersey Devils and the 1995 Calder Cup with the Albany River Rats. ==Playing career== Following a three-year WHL career in Seattle, Schwab saw time with the ECHL's Cincinnati Cyclones and the AHL's Utica Devils before settling in with the AHL's Albany River Rats for two seasons. During the 1994-95 season, Schwab was joined by fellow 1990 draftee Mike Dunham between the pipes. While Schwab led the league in goals against average with 2.59, the two combined for the AHL's fewest goals against and were awarded the Harry \\"Hap\\" Holmes Memorial Trophy as well as the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as the playoff MVP's helping the River Rats capture their first Calder Cup title. The next season, Schwab saw his first action in the NHL when he was called up to New Jersey where he appeared in ten games. At the end of the season, he was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning, where he stayed for three seasons. He then went out West to the Vancouver Canucks for another brief stay and spent time that year with the AHL's Syracuse Crunch and IHL's Orlando Solar Bears before moving on to play with the IHL's Kansas City Blades in 2000-01. Schwab began the 2001-02 season at the Toronto Maple Leafs' training camp without a contract. After an impressive pre-season, he was signed to the team as the backup goaltender for Curtis Joseph. Schwab started 30 games for the Leafs and had a career high 12 wins before signing as a free agent in the off-season with the team that originally drafted him back in 1990, the New Jersey Devils. The return to New Jersey was very timely for Schwab, as the Devils claimed the Stanley Cup in 2003 - the franchise's third title in nine years and Schwab's first as a player. Schwab's final game was played on January 17, 2004 where he posted a 2‚Äì1 overtime victory over the Washington Capitals. Schwab finished his career having played in 147 regular season NHL games amassing 43 wins, 63 losses and 13 ties with a goals against average of 2.89, a save percentage of .896, and 6 shutouts. Schwab appeared in 40 minutes of postseason action over 3 games with the Maple Leafs and Devils stopping all 13 shots he faced. He served as goaltending development coach and scout for three seasons (2005‚Äì08) with the Tampa Bay Lightning. He was the goaltending development coach for the San Jose Sharks (2008-2015).

The band is based at the Lac Courte Oreilles Indian Reservation, at in northwestern Wisconsin, which surrounds Lac Courte Oreilles (Odaawaa-zaaga'igan in the Ojibwe language, meaning \\"Ottawa Lake\\"). The main reservation's land is in west-central Sawyer County, but two small plots of off-reservation trust land are located in Rusk, Burnett, and Washburn counties. The Reservation was established in 1854 by the second Treaty of La Pointe. The Lac Courte Oreille ceded land under a treaty they signed with the United States in 1837, the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe, and the first 1854 Treaty of La Pointe. The tribal reservation has a land area of , including the trust lands, and a population of 3,013 persons as of the 2000 census. The most populous community is Little Round Lake, at the reservation's northwest corner. It is south of the non-reservation city of Hayward, the county seat of Sawyer County. ==Reservation== Lac Courte Oreilles is a land which is almost entirely covered by a forest and several lakes. To the northeast and east of Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation is Chequamegon National Forest, which was established in 1933 during the Great Depression. White-owned lumber companies had cleared the land of the trees earlier in the century and, during the Depression, Civilian Conservation Corps workers planted new trees. Today, both the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation and Chequamegon National Forest are recovering from the clear-cutting conducted by the lumber companies. Numerous lakes are within the borders of Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation or border it, including Ashegon, Blueberry, Chief, Cristner, Devils, Green, Grindstone, Gurno, Lac Courte Oreilles, Lake Chippewa, Little Round, Little Lac Courte Oreilles, Pokegama, Rice, Scott, Osprey, Spring, Summit, and Tyner lakes. Within the Reservation borders is the protected Grindstone Creek State Wildlife Management Area. Wild rice, called manoomin in Ojibwe language, grows on many of the waterways on the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation. Citizens of the Reservation still harvest it in the traditional way and it is one of the staples of the community. ==Government and economy== The band is federally recognized as a tribe and has its own elected government, consisting of a chairman and tribal council. Members are elected from enrolled members of the tribe. It owns and operates a tribal college, Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwa Community College, located in Hayward. The Tribe owns and operates the Sevenwinds Casino, to generate revenue for its people's welfare. It also operates a community radio station, WOJB-FM. The reservation hosts an \\"Honor the Earth\\" Pow Wow every summer. Rock drummer Mickey Hart's recording of some of the performers, Honor The Earth Powwow--Songs Of The Great Lake Indians, became a minor national hit in 1991. ==History== The Anishinaabe, part of the Algonquian languages family of peoples originating along the Atlantic Coast, migrated west and have lived in what is now northern Wisconsin for a long time. Following the Seven Fires Prophecy, Anishinaabe leaders ordered their warriors to expand to the west after they learned that the people mentioned in the prophecy had invaded in the East. They also sent their soldiers as far east as Maine and as far south as Florida, to defend Indian land from the white invaders. According to Native American historian William W. Warren, Anishinaabe people were living in northern Wisconsin before 1492 and the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean area. The Dakota Indians referred to the Anishinaabe as the Ra-ra-to-oans, which means \\"People of the Falls.\\" The French adopted the name. In the 17th century, Anishinaabe warriors from the north of Wisconsin were constantly fighting the white invaders (at that time and in that area, the French and French-Canadian colonists) and their Indian allies. Between 1630 and 1665, thousands of Indians who lived along the northeast Atlantic Coast were being driven from their homes by the French and their Indian allies. Many fled west to the north of present-day Wisconsin, seeking the safety of Lake Michigan and Anishinaabe warriors. The whites and their Indian allies invaded the eastern end of the Lake Superior region but were driven off. Their defeats were serious enough they requested a truce, to which Anishinaabe leaders agreed. The French and their Indian allies gained control of the lands east of Lake Michigan: what are now known as New York, southern Ontario, and parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania. That changed in 1680 after Anishinabe warriors were sent to the east to war on the white invaders and their Indian allies. By 1700, Anishinaabe soldiers had driven the whites back to the eastern coast, where they had large fortified settlements. Anishinaabe soldiers subjugated the Indian allies of the whites, who are known historically as the Five Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. Anishinaabe people absorbed them into their population in New York and southern Ontario. During the 17th and 18th centuries, control of northern Wisconsin and northeastern Minnesota was hotly contested by the Santee Sioux (Dakota) and the Lake Superior Chippewa (Ojibwe/Anishinaabe). By the close of the 18th century, the Ojibwe had pushed the Dakota out of Wisconsin and much of northern Minnesota to areas west of the Mississippi River. Although the 1825 First Treaty of Prairie du Chien recognized only a small portion of present-day Wisconsin as Dakota land, throughout the 18th and well into the 19th centuries, the Dakota and Ojibwe continued to launch military expeditions into each other's territories. The Battle of the Brule, which took place in October, 1842 was a battle between the La Pointe Band of Ojibwe Indians and a war party of Dakota Indians, with the Ojibwe being victorious. Later on in the 18th and early 19th centuries, more wars were fought between the Anishinaabeg and European Americans. English colonists had taken over rule from the French in eastern Canada and also established dominance up to the Appalachian Mountains in the Thirteen Colonies below the Great Lakes. At the end of the 18th century, those colonies achieved independence as the United States of America. Its settlers had already invaded Indian country west of the Appalachians, and more moved west. The US defeated an alliance of tribes in the Northwest Indian War, opening the area north of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi to more settlement by European Americans. The War of 1812 between the US and Great Britain was entered into by the Great Lakes Anishinaabeg on the side of Britain in an effort to defend their land. After the war, they signed treaties with the United States, but these were not honored. American settlers continued to encroach on their territories around the Great Lakes. In 1854, the second Treaty of La Pointe with the US established what is now the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation, in addition to other reservations for Ojibwe in this region. In the late 19th century, with increased European-American settlement, the United States wanted to relocate all Native Americans from Michigan and Wisconsin to west of the Mississippi River, proposing to consolidate them on the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota. The proposed relocation plan proved futile. The tribes resisted and a minor rebellion broke out in 1898 on the Leech Lake Reservation of northern Minnesota. The US finally left the tribes in small rural reservations in these areas. ==Communities== Lac Courte Oreilles reservation has several communities within its borders; most are predominately Native American in population. Little Round Lake is the largest community within the reservation, with a population of 1,081 in the 2010 census. Native Americans make up 90% of the community's population. Chief Lake is a predominantly Indian community, with 80% of the population. New Post has 72% Ojibwe residents. Reserve has a population that is 88% Native American. Northwoods Beach is located on the Reservation's west end, between Grindstone Lake and Lac Courte Oreilles. None of the Lac Courte Oreilles communities has developed to the level of a city or town. Most of the population of Reserve is scattered, although the heart of the community is a more dense village. The community's housing units are located in the woods. *Chief Lake *Little Round Lake *New Post *Northwoods Beach *Reserve ==Demographics== Lac Courte Orellies is one of several reservations that has a relatively large non-Native population within its borders. Broken treaty promises allowed settlement by white squatters and the US allowed them to stay. The 2000 census reported the population of the Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation at 3,013. Native Americans made up 2,306 of the population, with European Americans comprising the remainder. Non-Indians made up the remainder of the Reservation's population.Lac Courte Oreilles Reservation and Off-Reservation Trust Land, Wisconsin, United States Census Bureau ==Notable natives and residents== *Paul DeMain, is a journalist and founder of News from Indian Country in 1986, an independent Native American newspaper, now available online.

His work contributed to the re-opening of her case by federal and state officials in the late 20th century and the prosecution of people for her kidnapping and murder. He publicly withdrew his support for Leonard Peltier, an AIM activist previously convicted and sentenced to prison in relation to the deaths of two FBI agents.Deborah Kades, \\"Native Hero\\", Wisconsin Academy Review 2005, accessed 9 June 2011 * Jim Denomie, artist *Nenaa'angebi (Beautifying Bird), twin son of Ozaawindib, and a prominent leader of the Ojibwe in the 19th century, and * Ozaawindib (recorded as O-za-win-dib, also known as Yellow Head) was an 18th-century Ojibwa chief of the Prairie Rice Lake Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians.

Justus van Effen planned a scholarly career, and around 1699 he began his studies at the University of Utrecht, but after the early death of his father (on 6 May 1706) he was forced to become a private tutor, taking responsibilities for his mother and sister. He had made acquaintances among French √©migr√©s, in connection with whom he began literary life in 1713 by editing a French journal.

He was one of the early pioneers of computer-based comic-book lettering, and is one of the most prolific creators in that industry. ==Career== Starkings' lettering style was originally inspired by British comic strip letterers Bill Nuttall and Tom Frame. Starkings' UK career began with lettering jobs in 2000 AD's Future Shocks and various strips in Warrior. From there he moved to Marvel UK where he lettered Zoids in Spider-Man Weekly and Transformers before becoming an editor for the company in the late 1980s. Titles he edited included Death's Head and Dragon's Claws. However, by the beginning of the 1990s he devoted himself exclusively to lettering, finding work in the much larger comic-book industry in the United States. His work in the Whoniverse has been mostly confined to two periods. He was variously a writer, editor and letterer during the Sixth and early Seventh Doctors' eras in the pages of Doctor Who Magazine. At this time, he also served in the staff position of \\"picture consultant\\" for a number of issues. Two decades later, he returned to the newly-created American centre of Whoniverse publishing at IDW Publishing, working on several issues involving the Tenth Doctor. === In the 20th century === Starkings edited Redemption!, Culture Shock!, Nemesis of the Daleks and Follow That TARDIS!. Usually under his pseudonym of \\"Richard Alan\\" or Zed, he wrote or co-wrote Time and Tide, the aforementioned Nemesis of the Daleks and Up Above the Gods. He lettered or co-lettered Frobisher's Story, The Gift, The World Shapers and Up Above the Gods. === In the 21st century === For the BBC Wales era of the Whoniverse, Starkings co-wrote Cold-Blooded War under his own name. It was also a story he lettered, along with The Whispering Gallery and most issues of The Forgotten. He was also one of the letterers on Rift War! Beginning in 2014, he and Comicraft's Jimmy Betancourt lettered all of Titan Comics' Doctor Who comic book series. In 1992 Starkings founded Comicraft, a studio which trains and employs letterers and designers and provides \\"Unique Design and Fine Lettering\\" services for comic books from many different publishers. In the mid-1990s Comicraft, online as comicbookfonts.com began to sell their Font designs as software applications through their Active Images publishing company. ==Hip Flask== Originally Starkings had intended that the advertisements for these fonts would feature Marvel and DC Comics' characters, however when he failed to receive the authorisation to do that, Starkings created his own character to illustrate the ads ‚Äì Hip Flask an anthropomorphic hippopotamus \\"Information Agent\\". Hip Flask has since graduated to his own series of one-shot comic books, published by Active Images. Starkings plotted the first two issues with artist Ladr√∂nn and enlisted the assistance of Joe Casey to co-script. Mystery City and all subsequent issues are plotted and scripted by Starkings. In 2006 Image Comics launched an ongoing prequel series to Hip Flask, Elephantmen, written by Starkings and illustrated by Axel Medellin, Justin \\"Moritat\\" Norman, Marian Churchland, Tom Scioli, Henry Flint, Chris Bachalo and Chris Burnham. In 2001 the character's similarities with an Australian comic book character called Hairbutt (a bumbling anthropomorphic hippopotamus private detective) led Hairbutt co-creator Bodine Amerikah and Darren Close of OzComics to accuse Hip Flask creator Starkings of plagiarism. Starkings replied that he created Hip Flask without any knowledge of Hairbutt, and that their similarities were a bizarre coincidence.Brice, Jason. \\"Sentinels, Not Senators\\" .

These different rates of profit are balanced out by competition to give a general rate of profit which is the average of all these different rates. The profit that falls to a capital of given size according to this general rate of profit, whatever its organic composition might be, we call the average profit. That price of a commodity which is equal to its cost price, plus the part of the annual average profit on the capital applied in its production (not simply the capital consumed in its production) that falls to its share according to its conditions of turnover, is its price of production.‚Äù ‚Äì Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, pp. 257-258. A production price can be thought of as a type of supply price for products;Ronald L. Meek, Studies in the Labour Theory of Value. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1975, 2nd. edition, pp. 199-200. \\"We call it the price of production because in the long term it is the condition of supply, the condition for the reproduction of commodities, in each particular sphere of production.\\" - Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 300. it refers to the price levels at which newly produced goods and services would have to be sold by the producers, in order to reach a normal, average profit rate on the capital invested to produce the products (not the same as the profit on the turnover). The importance of these price levels is, that a lot of other prices are based on them, or derived from them: in Marx's theory, they determine the cost structure of capitalist production. The market prices of products normally oscillate around their production prices,Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 1000. while production prices themselves oscillate around product-values (the average current replacement cost in labour-time required to make each type of product). This understanding already existed in classical political economy (the idea of market prices which gravitate to \\"natural prices\\" or \\"natural price levels\\") but, according to Marx, the political economists could not really explain adequately how production prices were formed, or how they could regulate the trade in commodities. In addition, the political economists could not theoretically reconcile their labour theory of value with value/price deviations, unequal profit/wage ratios and unequal capital compositions. Consequently, the labour theory of value of the political economists was more in the nature of a metaphysical belief, than a scientific proposition. ==Sources and context== The concept of production prices is introduced and elaborated systematically in chapter 9 et seq. of the third volume of Das Kapital, although it is already referred to in earlier texts by Marx. The first significant discussion occurs in the Grundrisse (1857-1858), followed by numerous references in Theories of Surplus Value (1862-1863),In Theories of Surplus Value Marx used the term \\"cost-prices\\" to refer to what he later called prices of production. M.C. Howard & J. E. King, The political economy of Marx. Harlow: Longman Group Ltd, 1975, p. 233 note 39. letters by Marx to Engels of 2 August 1862 and 30 April 1868 outlining his theory, the Resultate manuscript (1863-1866), Capital, Volume I (1867) and Capital, Volume II (1865-1877).Karl Marx, Grundrisse. Penguin edition, 1973, p. 313-318, 761; Karl Marx, Theories of Surplus Value (3 Vols., see subject index). Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1978 (alternatively, Marx Engels Collected Works, Vols. 30, 31, 32, 33); Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I, Penguin 1976, p. 269 and p. 963 (the Resultate manuscript included as appendix in the Penguin edition, written somewhere between 1863 and 1866 - see also Marx Engels Collected Works Vol. 34); Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels, Letters on Capital. London: New Park, 1983, pp. 74-78 and 134-138.; Karl Marx, Capital, Volume II, Penguin 1978, p. 294, 413. In Capital, Volume III, Marx considers the operation of capitalist production as the unity of a production process and a circulation process involving commodities, money, and capital.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, chapter 1, p. 117. Capitalist production cannot exist without market sales, and therefore it is a type of production that fully depends on market trade. For the purpose of the analysis of the immediate process of capitalist production, which is the main subject of Capital, Volume I, successful market transactions are assumed and market fluctuations are initially mostly disregarded - but that gives only one half of the story.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin edition 1981, p. 117. The products have to be sold at a profit, and purchased at a competitive price, through market trade and the circulation of capital. The argument in Capital, Volume III (Marx intended to publish still more volumes, but did not manage to do so) is that the sales of newly produced commodities in the capitalist mode of production are regulated by their production prices.Howard Nicholas, Marx's theory of price and its modern rivals. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011. What products will sell for, has to do with what it normally costs to make them, plus the profit mark-up that will secure a normal average return on capital for the producing enterprise. For efficient producers, there will normally be a larger margin between their costs and their sales-revenue (more profit), and for less efficient producers, there will be a smaller margin between their costs and revenue (less profit). Marx's controversial claim is that the magnitude of the production prices for products is determined ultimately by their current replacement costs in average labour time, i.e. by the value of products. A lot of the academic debate about Marx's concept of production prices is probably caused by the fact that Marx never finalized the text of the third volume of Capital for publication, although he drafted it before publishing the first volume.Allen Oakley, The making of Marx's critical theory; a bibliographical analysis. London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1983, chapter 5 and 6. The book was edited together posthumously by Friedrich Engels, who tried to make a polished story out of a mass of draft manuscripts Marx left behind.The original manuscript for Capital Vol. 3 is now available in English: Fred Moseley, Marx‚Äôs Economic Manuscript of 1864‚Äì1865 (transl. Ben Fowkes). Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2016. Overall, the differences between the original text and Engels's version are not very great, because, by his own admission, Engels aimed to provide a fairly literal rendering of the manuscript - with a few exceptions, Engels did not attempt to alter the text, solve problems of content, or introduce new content. The theoretical problems or unclarities remaining in Marx's draft were therefore not removed by Engels' editing, but reproduced fairly literally. Marx sketched complicated issues in a shorthand way which is sometimes ambiguous and incomplete, and does not make all the implications explicit. According to the German Marxian scholar Michael Heinrich, \\"Marx was nowhere near solving all of the conceptual problems\\".Michael Heinrich, \\"Engels‚Äô Edition of the Third Volume of Capital and Marx‚Äôs Original Manuscript\\". Science & Society, Vol. 60. No. 4, Winter 1996-1997, pp. 452-466. However, Marx's concept is also frequently confused with similar concepts in other economic theories. For most economists, the concept of production prices corresponds roughly to Adam Smith's concept of \\"natural prices\\" and the modern neoclassical concept of long-term competitive equilibrium prices under constant returns to scale.For an historical discussion, see Ronald L. Meek, Studies in the labour theory of value. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1975. Nevertheless, the function of prices of production within Marx's theory differs from both classical political economy and neoclassical economics. ==Basic explanation== A production price for outputs in Marx's sense always has two main components: the cost-price of producing the outputs (including the costs of materials, equipment, operating expenses, and wages) and a gross profit margin (the additional value realized in excess of the cost-price, when goods are sold, which Marx calls surplus value). Marx's argument is that price-levels for products are determined by input cost-prices, turnovers and average profit rates on output, which are in turn determined principally by aggregate labour-costs, the rate of surplus value and the growth rate of final demand.Peter Flaschel and Willi Semmler, \\"The dynamic equalization of profit rates for input-output models with fixed capital\\", in: Willi Semmler (ed.), Competition, stability and non-linear cycles. Berlin: Springer Verlag, 1986, pp. 1-34. These price levels determine how much of the new output value that is created in excess of its cost price can actually be realized by enterprises as their gross profit. The suggestion is, that the differences among most producers with regard to their profit rates on capital invested will tend to \\"level out\\" as a result of business competition, so that a general norm emerges for the profitability of industries. ===Profit impost=== In capitalist production, a basic profit impost is the normal precondition for the supply of goods and services. When competition for product markets intensifies, the producers' margin between cost prices and sale prices, their true income, shrinks. In that case, the producers can only maintain their profits, either by reducing their costs and improving productivity, or by capturing a bigger market share and selling more product in less time, or both (the only other option they can try is product differentiation). In a well-established product-market, however, the fluctuations in supply and demand are usually not very large. This basic market logic was already well known by medieval merchant capitalists long before the dawn of the modern era in the 15th century.Robert S. Lopez \\"The Trade of Medieval Europe\\", in: Cambridge Economic History of Europe, 2nd edition , Cambridge University Press, 1987, p. 375-376. Medieval merchant houses could certainly estimate their own rate of surplus value and profit rate (the amount of (surplus-)labour required to yield a certain financial result or valorization) but they usually did not have so much knowledge about socially average profit rates; few relevant data or statistics were publicly available and a \\"general rate of profit\\" might not exist anyhow, for lack of an integrated national market for products and capital, and given the limited scope of industrialization.Maxine Berg, \\"Political economy and the principles of manufacture 1700-1800\\", in: Maxine Berg et al. (eds.), Manufacture in town and country before the factory. Cambridge University Press, 1983, pp. 33-58. In the 19th century, Marx noted, \\"Institutions emerge whereby each individual can acquire information about the activity of all others and attempt to adjust his own accordingly, e.g. lists of current prices, interconnections between those active in commerce through the mails, telegraphs, etc. (the means of communication of course grow at the same time). (This means that, although the total supply and demand are independent of the actions of each individual, each one attempts to inform himself about them, and this knowledge then reacts back in practice on the total supply and demand... (The possibility of general statistics, etc.)\\". - Karl Marx, Grundrisse, Penguin 1973, p. 161. ===Regulating prices=== The regulating price of a given type of product is a sort of modal average price level, above or below which people would be much less likely to trade the product. If the price is too high, buyers cannot afford to buy it, or try to get cheaper alternatives. If the price is too low, sellers cannot cover their costs and make a profit. So normally there is a limited range of prices within which the product can be traded, with upper and lower bounds. The production price then refers basically to the \\"normal or dominant price level\\" for a type of product that prevails during a longer interval of time.An in-depth discussion is provided in Anwar Shaikh, Capitalism. Oxford University Press, 2016, chapter 9. It presupposes that both the inputs and the outputs of production are priced goods and services‚Äîthat is, that production is fully integrated in fairly sophisticated market relations enabling a sum of capital invested into it to be transformed into a larger sum of capital. In pre-capitalist economies, this was not the case; many inputs and outputs of production were not priced. Marx's claim is that the production prices of products themselves are fundamentally determined by the comparative labour requirements of those products, and therefore are constrained by the law of value.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin edition 1981, pp. 277, 280-281, 774, 985, and 1020. Since, however, not all goods are produced or reproducible goods, not all goods have production prices. A production price in Marx's sense can exist only in markets developed sufficiently for a \\"normal\\" rate of profit on production capital invested to become the ruling average for a group of producers.\\"The prices that arise when the average of the different rates of profit is drawn from the different spheres of production, and this average is added to the cost prices of these different spheres of production, are the prices of production. Their prerequisite is the existence of a general rate of profit, and this presupposes in turn that the profit rates in each particular sphere of production, taken by itself, are already reduced to their average rates.\\" - Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 257. ===Dynamics=== Substantively, Marx argues that the prices of new products sold will, assuming free competition for an open market, tend to settle at an average level that enables at least a \\"normal\\" rate of profit on the capital invested to produce them, and, as a corollary, that if such a socially average rate of profit cannot be reached, it is much less likely that the products will be produced at all (because of comparatively unfavourable profitability conditions).Karl Marx, Theories of surplus value. Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1971, Part III, p. 83. Marx defines the \\"general rate of profit\\" as the (weighted) average of all the average profit rates in different branches of production - it is a \\"grand average\\" profit rate on production capital. The simplest indicator of this rate is obtained by dividing total surplus value by total production capital employed. According to Marx's theory, investment capital is likely to shift out of production activities where the rate of profit is low and toward activities where profitability is higher;Michael Heinrich, Introduction to the three volumes of Marx's Capital, p. 167. the \\"leading\\" sectors of industry are those where profitability is highest (today, these are in the production of computer facilities & hi-tech, healthcare, oil products and finance which serve the richer strata of the world population).See the Fortune Magazine 500 or the Forbes 500, or see Andrew D. Goldberg et al., Guide to the markets 2015 Q1. New York: J.P. Morgan Asset Management, 2015. The precondition is the free mobility of capital and labour, and thus there is a systemic tendency to remove all obstacles preventing investors from investing in sectors where profits are higher. If, for any reason, the free movement of capital is blocked or restricted, large differences in the profit rates of enterprises are likely to occur. In general, the trajectory of capitalist development is determined by the industries where the profits are the best, because their products are in high demand, because of special production or market advantages, etc.Ernest Mandel, Late Capitalism. London: NLB, 1975, chapter 3. According to Marx, the movements of different production prices relative to one another importantly affect how the total \\"cake\\" of new surplus value produced is distributed as profit among competing capitalist enterprises. They are the basis of the competitive position of the producers, since they fundamentally determine profit yields relative to costs. ===\\"Natural\\" prices=== Some writers argue that Marx's production price is similar, or performs the same theoretical function, as the \\"natural prices\\" of classical political economy found, for example, in the writings of Adam Smith and David Ricardo (though the concept of natural prices is much older). This is the orthodox Marxist view, based on quotations where Marx says that his concept of production prices recalls the classical idea of natural prices.\\"...what we call price of production is in fact the same thing that Adam Smith calls 'natural price', Ricardo 'price of production' or 'cost of production' and the Physiocrats prix necessaire, though none of these people explained the difference between price of production and value. We call it the price of production because in the long term it is the condition of supply, the condition for the reproduction of commodities, in each particular sphere of production.\\" - Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 300. In this case, Marx's production price would be essentially a \\"centre of gravity\\" around which prices for outputs in a competitive market will fluctuate in the long run (cf. Fred Moseley's view).Fred Moseley, \\"Marx's concept of Prices of Production: Long-Run Center-of-Gravity Prices\\" This is an interpretation within the framework of equilibrium economics, which suggests that production prices are really a kind of \\"equilibrium prices\\". It can be supported with some textual evidence, insofar as Marx sometimes defines the production price as the price that would apply if the supply and demand for products were balanced. At other times, he refers to a \\"long-term average price\\" or a \\"regulating price\\". He does not say precisely how these three different concepts are related.For example, \\"The price of production is regulated in each sphere, and regulated too according to particular circumstances. But it is... the centre around which the daily market prices revolve, and at which they are balanced out in definite periods\\" - Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 280. The main objection against equating production prices with natural prices is that Marx's concept of production prices is precisely a critique of the \\"natural prices\\". Support for this interpretation can be found in Capital, Volume I, where Marx criticizes and ridicules the concept of a \\"natural price of labour\\" - this concept, he argues, rests on confusions of several different economic categories.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I, Penguin 1976, p. 269, p. 675, p. 678-679. Similarly, in Capital, Volume III, Marx rejects the concept of a \\"natural\\" interest rate, arguing that what this really refers to is just the interest rate that results out of free competition.\\"What is called the natural rate of interest simply means the rate established by free competition. There are no ' natural ' limits to the interest rate.\\" Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 478. According to this argument, there is actually nothing \\"natural\\" about the allegedly \\"natural\\" prices - they are socially determined effects of capitalist production and trade. More importantly, the existence of production prices does not logically depend on, or presuppose, an equilibrium state. If the classical economists talked about the \\"naturalness\\" of price-levels, this was ultimately a theoretical apologism; they could not reconcile their labour theory of value with the theory of the distribution of capital. They assumed a market balance, without proving how it could exist. The general theory behind the concept of natural prices was that the free play of markets would, through successive adjustments in the trading process, \\"naturally\\" converge on price levels at which sellers could cover their costs and make a normal profit, while buyers could afford to buy products; with the effect, that relative labour requirements would be genuinely proportional to relative prices. Yet classical political economy provided no credible theory of how this process could actually occur. Since it confused and conflated the value of labour power with the price of labour, commodity values with their production prices, and surplus value with profit, i.e. because it mixed up values and prices, it could in the end explain the normal price levels of commodities only as \\"natural\\" phenomena. ===Observables and unobservables=== In the sphere of capitalist production, Marx argues, commodity values are directly observable only as prices of production for outputs, established jointly by average input costs and by the ruling profit margins applying to outputs sold. It is a result of the establishment of regular, developed market trade; the production price averages reflect the fact that production has become totally integrated into the circuits of commodity trade, in which capital accumulation has become the dominant motive. What prices of production simultaneously hide, he argues, is the social nature of the valorization process‚Äîthat is, how exactly an increase in capital value has occurred through production. The direct connection between labour time and value, still visible in simple commodity production, is largely effaced; only cost prices and sale prices remain, and it seems that any of the factors of production (which Marx calls the \\"Holy Trinity\\" of capitalism) can contribute new value to output, paving the way for the concept of the production function. ==Problems of interpretationDifferent types of production prices=== The first interpretative difficulty concerns the existence of various production prices. For more than a century, almost all Marxists, Sraffians and Post-Keynesians simply took Marx's concept of production prices for granted, as being more or less the same as Smith's and Ricardo's \\"natural price\\" idea (that is how it was taught, and presented in textbooks), and they did not inquire into the concept in precise detail.Peter M. Lichtenstein, An introduction to post-Keynesian and Marxian theories of value and price. London: Routledge, 1983, reprinted 2017. They believed, that the idea of a production price was simple, obvious and not controversial. So they missed altogether the fact that in Capital, Volume III Marx identified (though often not very clearly) at least six main types of production prices: * the private or enterprise production price which forms the starting-point of the analysis in the first chapter. This price equals the cost-price and normal profit on production capital invested which applies to the new output of a specific enterprise when this output is sold by the enterprise (the \\"individual production price\\"Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 781.). The rate of profit involved in this production price can be compared to the average rate of profit that obtains for a sector or nationally. * the sectoral production price. This price equals the cost-price and average profit rate on production capital invested which applies to the output of a commodity produced by a specific industry, sector or branch of production (at \\"producer's prices\\"). This is the production price which applies for a particular type or class of product, reflecting the average return the producers can normally expect to obtain in the given sector. In his discussion of ground rent, Marx notes especially the differences between industrial and agricultural production prices.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 892. The suggestion is that there is a structural difference between the average profit rates applying to different sectors of production. * the inter-sectoral production price. This price-level refers to the sale of output at producers' prices which reflect an average profit rate on a quantity of capital invested that applies to various sectors of industry. This is the fully formed industrial production price which Marx most often has in mind in his theoretical discussions of the equalisation process of profit rates; it reflects the producer's product-price at which the average rate of profit on production capital applying to a whole economic community is obtained (for example, a net return of 10%). * the so-called real price of production, which Marx himself defines as the price of production for the commodity produced and sold by an industry plus commercial profit on re-selling the commodity (warehousing, distribution and retailing etc.).Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 399. * the so-called market production price. \\"This production price... is determined not by the individual cost price of any one industrialist producing by himself, but rather by the price that the commodity costs on average under the average conditions for capital in that whole sphere of production. It is in fact the market price of production; the average market price as distinct from its oscillations.\\" Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 779. Cf.

This is roughly the same as what we would nowadays call the \\"average unit cost\\" of a product. * the economic production price. This price, a total cost-price (i.e. a replacement cost) equals the average cost price and average profit rate of an output at the point of sale to the final consumer, including all costs incurred by all the different enterprises participating in its production (factory, storage, transport, packaging etc.), plus tax imposts, insurance levies, incidental costs etc. In modern times, \\"costing\\" production in order to establish the expected yield on capital invested in it often involves assessing the whole value chain relative to the price level at which products can be sold to the final consumer. The question then is, how can the whole production of a product - from the factory gate to the final consumer - be organized so that it can sell to the final consumer at a price that the market will bear - and still make a good profit?Russell Hensley et al., The future of the North American automotive supplier industry: evolution of component costs, penetration, and value creation potential through 2020. Washington: McKinsey & Company, March 2012. Marx sometimes implies an \\"economic production price\\" when, for the sake of argument, he simply abstracts from everything that happens between the factory gate and the final consumer of a commodity. These different prices are revealed when we study the composition of the cost structure of a product at different stages of its production and supply. One source of interpretive difficulty is that Marx often assumes in his shorthand drafts that these six kinds of prices all refer to the same thing. But that is true only in the special case where one enterprise sells directly to the final consumer. The reason for this conflation is probably that Marx's real analytical concern was not really with the pricing processes as such, but with the main factors influencing the realisation and distribution of new surplus-value produced, when sales occur. After all, his argument was that competition in capitalism revolves around the quest of obtaining maximum surplus-value from production in the form of generic profit income (profit, interest, rent). The question was: how does a sum of capital invested in production get transformed into a larger sum of capital? What are the dynamics and overall results of that process? What are the implications for the process of economic reproduction? The existence of different types of production prices implies a much more complex picture than Marx initially provides in his discussion of the leveling out of profit rates through price competition. Thus, for example, in his discussion of ground rent, Marx claims that farm products can be persistently sold for more than their price of production, but below their value, while many manufactured products obtain their price of production only because they are sold for more than their value.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 892. In Marx's more developed theory of the circulation of commodities, the values of products, their prices of production and their market prices are all semi-autonomous variables which can both diverge and converge, through constant market fluctuations, affecting the profitability of enterprises. Nevertheless, Marx claims they will mostly tend to converge in the long term. ===Oversimplification in the model=== A second source of interpretive difficulty is that in his draft manuscript Marx often conflates (1) capital advanced (to acquire inputs necessary for production) with (2) capital in use and with (3) capital consumed (that fraction of the value of inputs used up in the production of new output).David Harvey, The Limits to Capital. London: Verso, 2006, p. 181. In his simplified quantitative examples, he just assumes very abstractly, for the sake of argument, that: *the value of output created, equals the sum of capital advanced plus surplus value. *the sum of input costs incurred in producing output (the cost price) is equal to the production capital advanced. *fixed capital advanced is equal to fixed capital consumed, i.e. there is no depreciation of fixed capital. *All output is sold at once, there is no problem with selling anything. *There are no variations in the turnover of capital. *The rate of surplus value is always uniform across all sectors. *The rate of profit on production capital is uniform across all sectors. *There are no obstructions to the free movement of labor and capital.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 895. Most probably the reason was that his real interest was in the overall dynamics of capital accumulation, competition, and the realisation of surplus value produced, assuming output would sell. He was thinking of grand averages and overall results. The simplified picture does not obtain in reality, among other things because, as Marx himself notes, capitalist competition turns on buying commodities below their value and selling them above their value (or, in the ideal competitive situation, to sell them below their value at a good profit, with a high turnover). Marx's theory is frequently confused with input-output economics and the marginalist theory of capital, in which total inputs and total outputs are always exactly equal in value, an equality accomplished by treating the factor income which is gross profit as an input, so that profit is both a cost and a revenue at the same time. Marx did not talk about inputs and outputs in this double-entry bookkeeping sense, where the source of funds balances against the use of funds; instead, he was concerned with how a sum of capital was transformed into a larger sum of capital through a net addition of new value created by workers in production. He was not really talking about quantities of input commodities and quantities of output commodities, but about quantities of capital required for commodity production and quantities of capital created by commodity production. If indeed the value of commodities bought was exactly equal to the value of commodities sold, capitalists would not even invest in production, because they would get no profit out of it. Their income would be offset exactly by their costs, yielding a zero net gain. So from Marx's point of view, input- output economics really mystified the \\"capital-relationship\\", i.e. the ability of the bourgeoisie to capitalize on the surplus labour of the workforce in virtue of its ownership of the means of production\\"Business cycle theorists, growth theory specialists, industrial organization experts, and other orthodox economists have often drawn on Marx‚Äôs writings in the development of their work. Perhaps one of the best known examples is that of Wassily Leontief, the father of the modern techniques of input/output analysis that are the basis of many contemporary capitalist planning models. The roots of his ideas, as he is quick to recognize, come partly from Marx‚Äôs reproduction schemes in Volume II of Capital.\\" - Harry Cleaver, Reading Capital politically, Antitheses/AK press, 2000, p. 28. (in chapter 48 of Capital, Volume III, he refers satirically to the factors of production theory as the \\"holy trinity\\" of political economy).Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin ed., p. 953f. ===Theoretical status of production prices=== A third source of interpretive difficulty concerns the question of what kinds of prices production prices really are.Anwar Shaikh, Capitalism. Oxford University Press, 2016, pp. 364-367. Do these prices really exist, and if so, in what way?Anwar Shaikh, Capitalism. Oxford University Press, 2016, chapter 9. Or are they only theoretical or ideal prices? What exactly is the \\"average\\" an \\"average\\" of?An average price or value can for example refer to a specific point in time, a specific time interval, or a group of assets under specified conditions. What does the \\"cost-price\\" really refer to, and at what point in the process (inputs purchased, output produced before sales, output sold)? Marx talks about production prices variously as:\\"The price of production is regulated in each sphere, and regulated too according to particular circumstances. But it is... the centre around which the daily market prices revolve, and at which they are balanced out in definite periods\\" - Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 280. *theoretical output prices which are equilibrium prices that would apply, if supply and demand are equal or balanced (this equilibrium could be thought of as a simple market balance, or as some kind of system equilibrium or dynamic equilibrium - where market prices gravitate towards or oscillate around some underlying value or natural price).Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, pp. 279, 303-304, 786, 1000. *regulating price levels of market prices for products which function as normsKarl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 273. for trade, setting upper and lower bounds for market-price fluctuations around an axis or level according to current labour requirements for their supply. *empirical price averages for products sold across a longer time-interval, obtained by averaging out actual output prices for several accounting intervals.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 489. Consequently, it remains somewhat ambiguous in what way such prices exist in reality. The conceptual challenge in modelling is to show how these three variables are related. It could, in principle, also be argued that some types of production prices are empirical price averages, while other ones only express theoretical price-levels. Obviously, if production prices are regarded only as purely \\"theoretical\\" entities, then it is not possible to claim also that they really regulate actual prices. A price level which exists only in theory, and not in reality, cannot be said to determine real price- levels (other than in the sense of publicly available price information influencing market expectations). The problem with the popular Newtonian metaphor of production prices as \\"centres of gravity\\", or alternatively the stochastic metaphor of production prices as \\"attractors\\" of market prices (both used in econophysics), is that they do not provide any causal explanation of how the \\"gravitation\\" or \\"attraction\\" process actually occurs in the real world, as a social process. The meaning of the metaphors keeps slip-sliding between empirical price-levels, theoretical price-levels and regulating price-levels. The \\"gravitation\\" could be interpreted as an actual physical process, an empirical stochastic result, or a purely theoretical description. Whatever the case, it must be explained how the gravitation process actually occurs. \\"Price-numbers\\" ultimately cannot substitute for a realistic ontology of prices and a realistic explanation of price structures.Alan Freeman, \\"An Invasive Metaphor: the Concept of Centre of Gravity in Economics.\\" London: University of Greenwich, July 2006.Munich Personal RePEc Archive copy In grappling with these issues, it must also be remembered that when Marx lived there was little macro-economic statistical data available that would enable theoretical hypotheses to be tested and relativised.Thomas Piketty, Capital in the twenty-first century. Harvard: Belknap Press, 2014, p. 230. Marx had deduced the motions of capital essentially from an enormous amount of economic literature he read, plus available commercial and government statistics. When, towards the end of his life, he toyed with the idea of investigating economic fluctuations econometrically,Zoltan Kenessey, \\"Why Das Kapital remained unfinished\\". In: William Barber (ed.), Themes in pre-classical, classical and Marxian economics. Aldershot: Edward Elgar, 1991, pp. 119-133. Samuel Moore convinced him this was not possible, because relevant economic data and mathematical tools did not exist yet.Letter of Karl Marx to Friedrich Engels, dated May 31, 1873. \\"I have been telling [Samuel] Moore about a problem with which I have been racking my brains for some time now. However, he thinks it is insoluble, at least pro tempore, because of the many factors involved, factors which for the most part have yet to be discovered. The problem is this: you know about those graphs in which the movements of prices, discount rates, etc. etc., over the year, etc., are shown in rising and falling zigzags. I have variously attempted to analyze crises by calculating these ups and downs as irregular curves and I believed (and still believe it would be possible if the material were sufficiently studied) that I might be able to determine mathematically the principal laws governing crises. As I said, Moore thinks it cannot be done at present and I have resolved to give it up for the time being\\". Marx, \\"Letter to Engels, 31 May 1873\\". Marx-Engels Werke Vol. 33, p. 821. Marx Engels Collected Works, Vol. 44, p. 504. Comprehensive macro-economic data became available only half a century later.Paul Studenski, The income of nations: theory, measurement and analysis, past and present. Washington Square: New York University Press, 1958. Marx had pointed the way to solving the problems raised by the classical political economists, without however providing a complete answer. He really believed though that a \\"general rate of industrial profit\\", applying economy-wide to all industries, would be formed (at least in the sense of the minimally acceptable profit rate that is the bottom line for the average business operation) but in truth he lacked the data to prove it. He did not discuss in any detail the difference between distributed and undistributed profit, or tax requirements, and how this might affect profit statements. His discussion was limited to physical capital and labour employed, abstracting from ancillary costs and incomes unrelated to production which enterprises usually have (including tax imposts and subsidies), asset transactions, and changes in market prices. ==Production prices and the transformation problem== The concept of production prices is one \\"building block\\" in Marx's theory of \\"the tendency of differences between rates of profit on production capital to level out through competition\\"See Capital Vol. 3, chapter 10 which aimed to tackle a theoretical problem left unsolved by David Ricardo. This problem concerned the question of explaining how an average or \\"normal\\" return on production capital invested (e.g. 8-16%) could become established, so that capitals of equal size reaped equal profits, even although the enterprises differed in capital compositions and amounts of labour performed (see labor theory of value) and consequently generated different amounts of new value. Intuitively, if the labour theory of value is true, then firms which use more labour to produce products would also create more value, and receive bigger profits. In reality, it is just the other way round: more efficient firms which use less labour to produce products receive bigger profits. According to Marx, this was not simply a logical problem, a social accounting problem or theoretical problem, but a structural contradiction intrinsic to the capitalist mode of production, which had to be continually mediated. The fact that more or less value could be appropriated by investors from the labour-efforts of the workers employed, and thus that different labour efforts were unequally rewarded, was in his eyes central to the competitive process - in which the norms of labour effort continually clashed with the norms of profitability. On the surface, it looked to the individual observer as if profit yields on capital determine expenditures on labour, but in aggregate, it is - according to Marx - just the other way around, since the volume of labour-time worked determined how much profit could be distributed among producing capitalists, via the sales of their products. The mass of surplus labour performed in the sphere of production set a limit for the mass of surplus value that could be distributed as profit in the sphere of circulation. ===Accounting interpretation=== In some interpretations of the Marxian transformation problem, total \\"(production) prices\\" for output must equal total \\"values\\" by definition, and total profits must by definition equal total surplus value. However, Marx himself explicitly denied in chapter 49 of the third volume of Das Kapital that such an exact mathematical identity actually applies. As soon as synchronic and diachronic variability in labour productivity is admitted, then the two famous identities cannot be true even in theory.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, pp. 971-972. Subsequently, Frederick Engels emphasized in this regard that an idealization of reality is not the same thing as reality itself, in a letter to Conrad Schmidt dated March 12, 1895.Karl Marx & Friedrich Engels, Letters on Capital. London: New Park, 1983, pp. 286-298. At best, it is an assumption used in modelling, which is justified if - as Marx believed - the divergence between total values and total production prices is quantitatively not very great, because actual labour expenditures and market competition constrain their divergence. But all this has never bothered neo-classical scholars such as Paul Samuelson in their interpretation of what Marx tried to do.P.A. Samuelson,\\"Wages and interest: a modern dissection of Marxian economic models,\\" American Economic Review, Vol. 47, 1957, pp.884-912; P.A. Samuelson, ‚ÄúUnderstanding the Marxian Notion of Exploitation: A Summary of the So-Called Transformation Problem Between Marxian Values and Competitive Prices,‚Äù in: Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. 9 no. 2, 1971, pp. 399‚Äì431; P.A. Samuelson, \\"The 'transformation' from Marxian 'value' to competitive 'prices': a process of rejection and replacement,\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Vol. 67, no. 1, 1970, pp. 423-425; P.A. Samuelson, \\"Insight and detour in the theory of exploitation: a reply to Baumol,\\" Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. 12, no. 1, 1974, pp.62-70; P.A. Samuelson, \\"Rejoinder: Merlin unclothed, a final word.\\" Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. 12 no. 1, 1974, pp.75-77. Logically, the only way Marx has to express an identity of aggregated output prices and aggregated output values, is to say that both of the totals are equal to exactly the same quantity of abstract labour time, or a quantity of gold. But this equivalence is only asserted \\"by definition.\\" In the real world, there exist no causal forces that could guarantee such an exact match. Moreover, the identity cannot be empirically proved in any direct way, since to find the quantitative relationship between labour-time and value, a relationship between labour-time and money must already be assumed. The \\"accounting\\" interpretation of production prices (value/price identity at the macro-level) by economists, according to which price distributions and value distributions can be inferred from each other, would suggest that the production price is empirically obtained from a straightforward statistical averaging of aggregated cost prices and profits. In that case, the production price is a theoretical midpoint which fluctuating actual prices would match exactly only by exception. ===Production prices as dominant price-levels=== In another interpretation, however, the production price reflects only an empirical output price-level which dominates in the market for that output (a \\"norm\\" applying to a branch of production or economic sector, which producers cannot escape from).Lefteris Tsoulfidis & Persefoni Tsaliki, \\"Marxian Theory of Competition and the Concept of Regulating Capital: evidence from Greek manufacturing\\", in: Review of Radical Political Economics, Vol. 37, No. 1, 2005, pp. 5-22; Lefteris Tsoulfidis & Persefoni Tsaliki, ‚ÄúClassical Competition and Regulating Capital: Theory and Empirical Evidence‚Äù.

That is, the prevailing value proportions and necessary labour requirements set a range or band within which product-prices will move. In practice, that means simply that there exists a minimum sale price at which a commodity can be viably and profitably produced; if it is not possible to sell a product at that price, it is unlikely that it will be produced at all.

Anwar Shaikh modelled the formation and change of production prices mathematically using iterative methods to show a convergence of prices and values.Anwar Shaikh, \\"Marx's theory of value and the 'transformation problem'\\", in Jesse Schwartz (ed), The Subtle Anatomy of Capitalism. Goodyear Publishing Company, 1977. The iterative method was first used by George Charasoff in 1910, and subsequently developed by Japanese economists such as Kei Shibata and Nobuo Okishio.Kenji Mori, \\"Georg von Charasoff's Linear Economic Analysis and Anticipation of von Mises Iteration in Economic Analysis.\\". Tohoku University, 2012. Subsequently, Anwar Shaikh concretized the concept of the production price as the \\"regulating price\\" dominating the market for a type of product, using the notion of \\"regulating capitals\\".Anwar Shaikh, \\"Notes on the Marxian notion of competition.\\" Unpublished paper, New School of Social Research, 1979. Anwar Shaikh, Capitalism. Oxford University Press, 2016, pp. 221, 380, 400f. Machover *Emmanuel Farjoun and Moshe Machover (1984) reject the whole idea that a \\"uniform rate of profit\\" would ever exist in reality, contrary to Marx's suggestion that competition would tend to establish at least a minimally \\"acceptable\\" average rate of profit on production capital invested to produce outputs, and returns proportional to capital size.Emmanuel Farjoun and Moshe Machover, Laws of Chaos; A Probabilistic Approach to Political Economy, London: Verso, 1983. ; Patrick Julian Wells, The rate of profit as a random variable. Phd dissertation, School of management, Open University, London 2007 Machover consequently rejects the concept of production prices as a useless concept. He argues: Kliman Supporters of the Temporal Single System Interpretation, such as Andrew Kliman, believe that Machover's inequality does not really arise, since, if Marx is read correctly, there is no necessity for the value of total inputs to be equal to the value of total outputs, or for inputs and outputs to be valued simultaneously. It is certainly true that transactions can be \\"simultaneous\\": buyer and seller can get their money or goods at the same time. But the same is not true for production. You cannot produce an output before you have got an input, and once you have bought an input, it takes time to produce an output, which becomes an input to the next cycle of production. The new output is not reducible to the sum of inputs, because it is a new use-value to which new value has been added by living labor. Once the output has been produced and sold, a production price (or a unit cost price) can be fixed \\"after the fact\\", but that price is based on the preceding capital outlays which are fixed once the output has been produced, plus a profit mark-up, and usually cannot change later (at least not very significantly, in the ordinary situation). That aside, in practice it is not really true that every commodity has a uniquely formed production price, as Machover suggests. At best one could say that a particular type of commodity (for example, a good quality vacuum cleaner) exhibits a normal, average production price. The production price usually applies to the capital value of the whole new output being sold, on which a profit rate is calculated. The profit or surplus value component of an individual commodity is rarely in equal proportion to the total profit on the total turnover of that type of commodity. If, for example, the total gross profit mark-up in the unit-cost structure of a packet of butter at the point of sale to the consumer is (say) 45%, that does not mean that the profit rate on the total production capital of the butter producer equals 45%. The butter producer would need to produce and sell a gigantic amount of butter in a very short time, to obtain such a high profit rate on his output. McKinsey analysts found that for every $1.00 of operating profit on consumer goods sold in the US in 2008, retailers collected a profit of about $0.31 (down from $0.60 in 1999) while the suppliers, packagers, and others along the value chain behind retail received $0.69. To obtain the same profit as before, fewer retail outlets have to sell many more products, in a shorter time-span. This can lead among other things to the phenomenon of food deserts. Conceptualization These readings of Marx imply that traditional interpretations of the transformation problem are really rather meaningless; the apparent mathematical wizardry is based on false interpretations of the concepts involved, and the reciprocal effects of individual actions and aggregate social outcomes is overlooked. Mathematical equations cannot substitute for conceptual precision in the definition of measuring units; they can only reveal the logical and quantitative implications of concepts and measurement units. ===Statics and dynamics=== At the beginning of Capital, Volume III, Marx provides a clue to how he thinks the \\"transformation problem\\" is solved in reality. He implies that it can be solved only by examining capital and profit distributions as a dynamic process, rather than statically. His argument is, that what industrial competition really revolves around, is principally the difference between the value of the new commodities produced, and their cost-prices, i.e. the potential surplus-value (the trading gain) which can be realized from them. There are constant disparities in space and time between labour-expenditures and capital returns, but also just as constant attempts to overcome or take advantage of those disparities. Thus, unrestricted economic competition has the result that the law of value regulates the trade in newly produced commodities: the ultimate limits of what products will trade for, i.e. their supply price, are set by comparative costs in labour-time. Assumptions In the real world, *a uniform rate of profit and a uniform rate of surplus value for all industries do not exist, except in the sense of a minimum acceptable rate of profit or a baseline productivity level (below which an enterprise is likely to go out of business, since it cannot better its capital costs).Emmanuel Farjoun and Moshe Machover, Laws of Chaos; A Probabilistic Approach to Political Economy. London: Verso, 1983. *The agents of capital do not aim simply to reach the average rate of profit, but an above-average rate of profit (the maximum profit, or a \\"surplus profit\\").Ernest Mandel, Late Capitalism. London: New Left Books, 1975. *The rate of surplus value and the turnover time can vary among different producers, and across production periods.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume 3, Penguin 1981, pp. 241-242, p. 275. Chapter 4 in the third volume of Marx's Capital about the impact of turnovers on profitability was added by Friedrich Engels. *The migration of labor and capital may be restricted by technical, legal or political factors.See e.g. Ha-Joon Chang, Kicking away the ladder. London: Anthem Press, 2002. *Competition is not a \\"level playing field\\", but a process in which unequally positioned capitalists try to obtain or maintain extra profits, including the blocking of competitors in various ways to improve their own market position. This process can be fairly benign and legal, but can also become vicious and criminal, and lead to outright war.Anwar Shaikh, Capitalism. Oxford University Press, 2016, Part II. *the relationship between product-values and product-prices is expressible mathematically only in probabilistic (stochastic) terms, not as a neat-and-tidy simultaneous equation based on accounting identities.Paul Cockshott & Allin Cottrell, \\"What is at stake in the debate on value\\", October 21, 2005. *total capital consumed diverges from total capital advanced, and total capital advanced is larger than total physical production capital, just as the gross business income after costs is typically greater than the profit component of the new value added. *since the production price refers only to the cost prices and profit yields for newly produced outputs, the current production price can be definitely calculated only after (or on the assumption that) the newly produced output is sold, and when the total turnover is known. Competition dynamics When Marx created a simplified, abstract model of profit distributions, he was not primarily trying to prove that the two famous identities (total profit=total surplus value, and total product value=total production price) are compatible with price-value divergences and with profit distributions according to capital employed (to the contrary: for analytical purposes, Marx assumes that they are compatible). Instead, he was trying to model the basic parameters of business competition for a share of the new surplus-value from the products produced by the working class. By identifying what the business competition is ultimately about, Marx was able to explain both what really motivates the business owners, and why the surface appearance of the business process perceived by an individual is almost the exact inverse of the real economic process in society as a whole.Anwar Shaikh, Capitalism. Oxford University Press, 2016, Part II. ==Value and price== Much criticism of Marx's concept originates from the ambiguities referred to earlier. Consequently, many of the criticisms can, according to some Marxists, be dispelled simply by a more exact definition of the cost, product and revenue aggregates used, and of the timing of transactions (see e.g. Temporal Single System Interpretation).Duncan Foley, \\"Review of Carchedi and Freeman (eds.), Marx and Non-Equilibrium Economics\\" ===Ambiguities=== In doing so, it must be admitted though that Marx's draft manuscript often shows sloppy use of terminology and concepts, and that Marx's purpose was often not fully explicit. At a high level of abstraction, he moves very easily and cavalierly from values to prices and back again, and restricts his discussion of \\"capital invested\\" to intermediate goods, fixed capital and labour power only. *Sometimes the transformation is portrayed as being only a quantitative change, but sometimes also as a qualitative change. *Sometimes he suggests the transformation is a change from one form of value to another,Karl Marx, Capital, Volume II. Penguin 1981, p. 263. at other times that there is a transition from value-form to price form.Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 274. *Sometimes the suggestion is, that a price category fully replaces a value category, at other times both categories always co-exist, and require each other, so that production prices can adjust to product-values but product-values can also adjust to production prices.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 305. *Sometimes the transformation from value to production price is presented as a logical development, at other times the production price is presented as an irrational expression.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 300. *Sometimes the production price is presented as an observable category, and at other times as a hidden regulator of market prices.Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 139, 272, 311-313, 1008 etc. *Sometimes the transformation is presented as an historical process, at other times as a logical process, or as a conceptual (or epistemic) transition.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 277. *Sometimes the sum total of production prices is equated with the sum total of product- values,Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 303-304. while at other times it is asserted or implied that these cannot be equal.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, pp. 971-972. It never becomes quite clear how exactly these different ideas can all be easily reconciled, which makes it difficult for academics to understand the intention of Marx's theory. Quite likely Marx would have ironed out inconsistencies if he had prepared his own draft for publication, but he did not do so, leaving his readers with important issues of interpretation. ===Valorization and realization=== In Marx's view, a capitalist production process was a valorisation process in which new value was formed. The theoretical problem was, that this value- forming process - the process vital for capital accumulation - took place mainly external to the market, being bracketed by the transactions M-C (purchase of inputs, C, using money, M) and C'-M' (sales of new output, C', for more money, M'). Between the successive exchanges, however, economic value was conserved, transferred and added to. Management then tried to estimate the cost and profit implications of different tasks and activities in production for the growth of capital, without full certainty of results. But in that case, the domains of product-values and product-prices, and consequently the domains of value relations and price relations, were separate but co-existing and overlapping domains (unless one is willing to argue that goods have an economic value only at the point where they are being sold for a price). \\"Price management\\" was not really possible insofar as prices were determined by markets which individual producers could not control, but value-based management was possible. *Goods could sell below or above their real or socially average value, and that was precisely the critical problem for capitalists, because it affected their gross income and profit margins. The Marxian product-values might be of no interest whatever to capitalists, but the prevailing cost structures and price-levels in their markets certainly are. The wealth of capitalist society might present itself as \\"a mass of commodities\\" (as Marx himself put it), but before and after the commodities were sold, they existed outside the market as use values. At that point, they had only a value and a use-value, but not an actual market price (though obviously one could estimate an hypothetical selling price - see also real prices and ideal prices). *Thus, at the point of production, the \\"factors of production\\" themselves had no actual market price either, only a value, because they were being used to create new products, rather than being offered for sale (indeed, what a particular business enterprise was currently \\"worth\\" in total, as a going concern, might be very difficult to say; it would depend on how much profit income it was expected to yield in the future compared to the capital assets invested in it, but even if a total price could be estimated, its individual assets might change in value continuously). *A quantity of value was produced by enterprises, but how much of that value would actually be realised by an enterprise as income from sales, or how gross revenues would be distributed among producers, could not be established with certainty in advance. Yet, the value of the total masses of output-values actually produced by all enterprises affected the market prices that could be obtained by each in distribution; it affected how the market would reward each of the producers, and there was a real, systematic relationship between total value produced and total sales revenue (even although these might not be equal). *More importantly, producers were constantly adjusting their commercial behaviour to the emerging economic reality (the \\"state of the market\\"), as far as they could. And that adjustment followed a specific pattern; Marx argued it created a specific trajectory for capitalist development, guided by the quest for realizing extra surplus value. There is, he argues, a permanent imperative to increase productivity, and producers aim to utilize every possibility for gaining competitive advantage (which includes blocking competition from others in some way). How could this business reality best be modelled? In contemporary \\"value-based management\\" by corporations, we can witness a continual cross-reference between past prices, current prices and future prices occurring, because there is practically no other way to do it for business purposes. In the words of group controller Gerard Ruizendaal of Royal Philips Electronics, A partner of McKinsey & Company comments: .In that case, it is impossible for the sum of input values to be exactly equal to the sum of output values. Indeed, that is exactly what, according to Marx, capitalists are in business for: to invest a sum of capital in production in order to get a larger sum of capital out of it. In bourgeois theories, value appears spontaneously out of trading activity in the sphere of circulation.\\"The excess value or surplus-value realized with the sale of the commodity... appears to the capitalist as an excess of its sale price over its value, instead of an excess of its value over its cost price, so that the surplus-value concealed in the commodity is not simply realized by its sale, but actually derives from the sale itself.\\" Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 128. The more the market expands and the more buying and selling there is, the more value there is, on this view. For Marx, it is in reality exactly the other way around: the more value workers create for their company, the faster companies can increase their revenues and deploy more capital at attractive rates of return. Marx regarded the prices of production as the \\"outward expression\\" of the results of a valorisation process in production, and in order to be able to talk about price aggregates at all, he thought reference to value relations was completely unavoidable. Not only was a value- theoretic principle required simply to group prices, relate them and aggregate them (meaning principles of value equivalence, comparable value, value transfer, value conservation, value creation and value used up or destroyed), but most of the stock of labour-products in an economy at any time had no actual price, simply because they weren't being traded. To what extent their value could be realised through exchange in the future could be known definitely only \\"after the fact\\", i.e. after they were actually sold and paid for. In the meantime, one could only hypothesize about their price, working from previous data. But in the final analysis, the attribution of value to products implied a social relation, without which value relations could not be understood. A community of independent private producers expressed their co- existence and mutual adjustment through the trading prices of their products; how they were socially related was expressed through the forms of value. ==Evaluation== The concept of \\"average profit\\" (a general profit rate) suggested that a process of competition and market-balancing had already established a uniform (or ruling average, or normal) profit rate previously; yet, paradoxically, what profit volumes would be (and consequently profit rates) could be established only after sales, by deducting costs from gross revenues. An output was produced before it was definitively valued in markets, yet the quantity of value produced affected the total price for which it was sold, and there was a sort of \\"working knowledge\\" of normal returns on capital. This was a dynamic business reality Marx sought to model in a simple way.Henryk Grossmann, \\"Die Wert-Preis-Transformation Problem bei Marx und das Krisenproblem\\". In: Zeitschrift fur Sozialforschung (Leipzig), Vol. 1, 1932. Reprinted in: Friedrich Eberle (ed.), Aspekte der Marxsche Theorie 1: Zur methodischen Bedeutung des 3. Bandes des Kapital. Frankfurt: Suhramp Verlag, 1973, pp. 195‚Äì227. ===Lack of a formal proof=== Marx's critics interpreting his models often argue he keeps assuming what he needs to explain, because rather than really \\"transforming values into prices\\" by some quantitative mapping procedure, such that prices are truly deduced from labour-values, he either (1) equates value quantities and price quantities, or else (2) he combines both value quantities and price quantities in one equation. Somewhat confusingly, the cost price refers at one point to the capital advanced (input), and at another point to a component of the value of the new product (output). Thus, for example, either Marx infers a rate of profit from a given capital composition and a given quantity of surplus-value, or else he assumes a rate of profit in order to find the amount of surplus-value applying to a given quantity of capital invested. That might be fine if the aim is to just investigate what profit an enterprise or sector would receive on average, having produced a certain output value with a certain capital composition. But this manoeuvre of itself cannot contain any formal proof of a necessary quantitative relationship between values and prices, nor a formal proof that capitals of the same size but different compositions (and consequently different expenditures of labour-time) must obtain the same rate of profit. It remains only a theory. Marx insists both that output prices obtained will necessarily deviate from values produced, but also that the sum of prices would equal to the sum of values in the pure case, yet, critics claim, he fails to show quantitatively how a distribution process could then occur such that price magnitudes map onto value magnitudes, and such that a uniform profit rate returns equal profits to capitals of equal sizes (a mapping relation is used here in the mathematical sense of a bijective morphism, involving one-to-one correspondence between value quantities and price quantities via mathematical equations). In that case, there is again no formal proof of any necessary relationship between values and prices, and Marx's manuscript really seems an endless, pointless theoretical detour leading nowhere. In modelling, simple logical paradoxes appearW. van Drimmelen, Meerwaarde en winst. Nijmegen: Socialistische Uitgeverij Nijmegen, 1976, chapter 4. of the type that: *in a static model, it is impossible to uphold the postulate of a uniform rate of profit and the postulate of total values=total prices at the same time; *to find production-prices, a uniform rate of profit must be assumed, while at the same time to find a uniform rate of profit, production-prices must already be assumed; *a price level must be assumed, rather than be deduced from labour-values. Beyond paradoxes, stuff just does not add up, unless more assumptions are introduced into Marx's examples, raising the question of which assumptions are legitimate to make, and whether they can solve anything without creating further inconsistencies.Shinzaburo Koshimura, Theory of capital reproduction and accumulation. Kitchener, Ontario: DPG Publishing Co., 1975, chapter 5. Koshimura provides a very clear exposition of the topic. All the conceptual and logical issues described in the above become crucial when attempts are made to model value and price aggregates mathematically to study capitalist competition. Different kinds of theoretical assumptions or interpretations will obviously lead to very different results. ===What is the transformation?=== In general, many modern Marxists nowadays think that Marx's idea of \\"transformation\\" was badly misinterpreted.Alan Freeman and Guglielmo Carchedi (eds.), Marx and Non-Equilibrium Economics. Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 1996; Fred Moseley, Money and Totality. A Macro-Monetary Interpretation of Marx‚Äôs Logic in Capital and the End of the Transformation Problem. Leiden: Brill, 2016; Anwar Shaikh, Capitalism. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016. It does not refer to a \\"mathematical conversion of values into prices\\". After all, constantly shifting product-values and product-prices co-exist side by side all the time according to Marx's theory, and operate in tandem. Rather, the transformation means that the direct regulation of the exchange of commodities according to their value is, in a capitalist mode of production, transformed into the regulation of the exchange of commodities by their production prices - reflecting the fact, that the supply of commodities in capitalist society has become conditional on the accumulation of capital, and therefore on profit margins and profit rates, within the framework of market competition. Nevertheless, Marx argues that production prices are still determined by underlying product-values (i.e. the average labour requirements for their supply). There is no logical proof available for that argument, only an empirical proof, insofar as there is a close correspondence between the magnitudes of producers' product prices and the magnitudes of labour-time required to produce them, across longer intervals of time (see below).Anwar Shaikh, Capitalism. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, chapter 9. If market trade consisted only of simple exchange (the exchange of things of equal value by the direct producers themselves), then balancing production effort, output and demand would be a fairly simple, straightforward matter. But in reality it is not so straightforward precisely because capitalist market trade is not simple exchange. Production effort, output and demand can be balanced in capitalism, only if sufficient profits are made and the accumulation of capital grows. In reality, products are constantly being sold above or below their value, according to what makes the best possible profit on the turnover, given market fluctuations. Whatever view one takes on the theoretical issues, no one can evade the (either simultaneous or sequential) reciprocal effects of individual business behaviour and aggregate economic outcomes. Additionally, it must also be recognised that \\"prices\\" are not all of one kind; actual market prices realised are not the same as ideal prices of various kinds, which may be extrapolated from real prices. ===Level of abstraction=== A more serious criticism of Marx is that the theory of prices of production is still pitched at a far too abstract theoretical level to be able to explain anything like specific real price movements. That is, Marx only illustrated with examples the general results towards which the competitive process would tend to move in capitalism as a social system. He tried to establish what regulates product prices in the \\"simplest and purest case\\". He believed that if one could not do that, then one could also not explain all the variations from the pure case. He had not however provided a model for accurately predicting specific price movements. In this regard, it is interesting to study the writings of Michael Porter, in order to see how Marx's original intent relates to modern competitive business practice, and how it might be elaborated onBob Rowthorn, \\"Wealth of Nations. Review of Michael Porter, 'The competitive advantage of nations'.\\" Marxism Today (London), October 1990, p. S3. See also by Michael Porter, Competitive advantage and Competitive strategy.

Columbia University Press, 1984; Christian Bidard, Prices, Reproduction, Scarcity. Cambridge University Press, 2004; Peter Flaschel, Topics in classical micro- and macroeconomics Heidelberg: Springer, 2010; Anwar Shaikh, Capitalism. Oxford University Press, 2016; Theodore Mariolis & Lefteris Tsoulfidis, Classical Economics and Reality. A Spectral Analysis of the Theory of Value and Distribution. Tokyo: Springer, 2016. Some critics conclude that because Marx fails to \\"transform\\" value magnitudes into price magnitudes in a way consistent with formal logic, he has not proved value exists, or that it influences prices; in turn, his theory of labour-exploitation must be false. But the validity of Marx's value theory or his exploitation theory may not depend on the validity of his specific transformation procedures, and Marxian scholars indeed often argue that critics mistake what he intended by them. In particular, since value relations - according to Marx - describe the proportionalities between average quantities of labour-time currently required to produce products, value proportions between products exist quite independently of prices (and irrespective of whether goods are currently priced or not). As the structure of product-values changes across time, the structure of prices is likely to change as well, but product-prices will fluctuate above or below product- values and typically respond to changing value proportions only with a certain time lag. Essentially, the advantage of distinguishing sharply between values and prices in this context is that it enables us to depict the interaction between shifts in product-values and shifts in product-prices as a dynamic process of real-world business and market behaviour, given the reality of different growth rates of supply and demand, i.e. not a study of the conditions for market balance, but a study of the actual process of market balancing occurring with a specific social framework, through successive adjustments which occur in a specific pattern. Arguably ideal prices could substitute for values in this analysis, but Marx's argument is that product- values will, ontologically speaking, really exist irrespective of corresponding product-prices, i.e. irrespective of whether product-values are actually being traded, whereas ideal prices do not really exist other than in computations; they are only an hypothetical description. The reason is that product-values refer to empirical quantities of labour-time performed, which are not hypothetical, but an inescapable physical and social reality. This type of analysis paves the way for an important new Marxian criticism of Piero Sraffa's otherwise brilliant critique of capital theory. In Sraffian theory, the value of a commodity \\"contains\\" both the average labour directly involved in making it (\\"direct labour\\") and past labour contained in the materials from which it is made (\\"indirect labour\\" or \\"dated labour\\").Ajit Sinha, Theories of Value from Adam Smith to Piero Sraffa.

In Marx's developed theory, however, the value of the commodity represents the average labour currently required to make it, given the current state of the whole production complex - it is the current social valuation (the replacement cost) of that commodity.Among the first scholars to state this clearly is Ian P. Wright. This is a synchronic valuation, not a diachronic one.\\"...the value of a commodity is determined not by the quantity of labour actually objectified in it, but by the quantity of living labour necessary to produce it.\\" - Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I, Penguin 1976, p. 676-677. \\"...the value of commodities is determined not by the labour-time originally taken by their production, but rather by the labour-time that their reproduction takes, and this steadily decreases as the social productivity of labour develops.\\" - Marx, Capital, Volume III, Penguin 1981, p. 522. This was not so clearly realized during the 20th century, because economists could not grasp how, in the course of Marx's dialectical story, the meaning of the operative concept of value itself could undergo some important changes.Ronald L. Meek, \\"A plain person's guide to the transformation problem\\". In: Ronald L. Meek, Smith, Marx and after. Ten essays in the development of economic thought. London: Chapman & Hall, 1997, pp. 95-119. Because Marx's developed concept of value differs from the simplified concept of value, economists thought that Marx's theory was formally inconsistent.Ian P. Wright, \\"prices of production are proportional to real costs\\". Discussion paper no. 59, Economics Department, Faculty of Social Sciences, The Open University. Milton Keynes, January 2007; Howard Nicholas, Marx's theory of price and its modern rivals. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011. ===Empirical evidence=== Some economists and computer scientists, such as Prof. Anwar Shaikh and Dr. Paul Cockshott, argue with statistical evidence that even just a \\"93% accurate Ricardian labour theory of value\\",George J. Stigler, \\"Ricardo and the 93% labour theory of value\\". The American Economic Review, Vol. 48, No. 3, June 1958, pp. 357-367. is a better empirical predictor of prices than other theories.E.M. Ochoa, Labor Values and Prices of Production: an Inter-Industry Study of the U.S. Economy, 1947-1972, PhD Thesis, New School for Social Research, 1985. Anwar Shaikh, \\"the Empirical Strength of the Labor Theory of Value\\". In: Riccardo Bellofiore (ed.), Conference Proceedings of Marxian Economics: A Centenary Appraisal. London: Macmillan, 1998 ; W. Paul Cockshott papers ;Theodore Mariolis & Lefteris Tsoulfidis, Classical Economics and Reality. A Spectral Analysis of the Theory of Value and Distribution. Tokyo: Springer, 2016, chapter 3. That is, the only real proofs of Marx theory and its applicability, beyond showing its internal logical consistency, are to be found in the evidence of experience. Whether more scholars will take up this challenge for research more comprehensively remains to be seen. Mostly, economists have preferred to build abstract mathematical models on the basis of a bunch of assumptions, rather than comprehensively investigate available empirical data for the purpose of creating an empirically-based theory about economic life. This contrasts with business managers, who have a strongly empirical theory of how business actually works, based on their daily experience of how things go in business. It is not difficult to prove a close positive correlation between the value of net output and the labour hours worked to produce it, since the payments which constitute that value, are themselves earnings which are necessarily proportional to time worked and paid for. Even if it is assumed, that gross profits are not proportional to time worked, by some margin, the total labour- cost involved in the total net output is nevertheless typically more than half of the value of the total net output or gross value added (in the US, labour compensation is nowadays around 55% of the value of total net output). The netted totals in the US National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA's) for 2015 show, that annual labour costs were about $9.7 trillion while the total operating surplus or gross profit (net of depreciation) was about $4.5 trillion.Bureau of Economic Analysis, Table 1.10: \\"Gross Domestic Income by Type of Income\\". In other words, total US labour earnings are twice the size of total gross profit receipts directly generated by production. Since total wage costs are based on time-wages, it is simple math to understand that any measure of the net value added (gross labour compensation + gross profits) which Marx called the value product must necessarily show a strong positive correlation with the total labour hours worked. What is statistically much more difficult to prove, is the relationship between prices and values in the actual distribution of net output (a traditional example mentioned, is that while in South Korea workers on average work the most working hours in the world, per capita per year, Korean value-added per capita has been much lower than might be expected; it is not so easy to explain, why this is the case).OECD statistics provide data on labour productivity levels in the total economy for many countries. See also Tim Worstall, \\"Korean Wages are now higher than Japanese wages, perhaps for the first time in 3,000 Years.\\" Forbes Magazine, 14 February 2015. A very interesting confirmation of the basic idea that Marx had is provided from a most unexpected source: post-Keynesian economics. After mustering a lot of empirical evidence about pricing practices, the leading heterodox \\"real-world\\" economist Fred Lee concluded that: However, a sharp distinction must be drawn between Marx's own theory and subsequent Marxist or Sraffian theories. As Lee emphasizes, \\"the typical statement made by Sraffians and Marxists that prices equal their costs of production (which includes a uniform rate of profit) in long-period positions has no conceptual correspondence to the concepts of costs and prices used by business enterprises.\\" Consequently, the Marxist and Sraffian theories are not grounded in the real world of business operations, because Marxists and Sraffians confuse a purely abstract model with empirical reality.Frederic S. Lee, Post-Keynesian Price Theory. Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 204 note 10. Fred Lee admits that the magnitude and the relative stability of the profit mark-up for products in modern capitalism \\"remains theoretically underexplained in Post Keynesian theory\\"J.E. King (ed.),The Elgar Companion to Post-Keynesian Economics. Cheltenham: Edward Elgar, 2003, p. 287. ===The total circuit of capital and Shaikh's solution=== One possible solution to the \\"transformation problem\\", largely ignored in the literature, is that Marx tried to sketch a redistribution of value in too simplistic terms, considering the profitability of different production capitals in abstraction from the total circuit of capital. The problem that Ricardo failed to solve, was one of how capitals of equal sizes could empirically attract very similar profits, despite empirically manifest unequal expenditures of labour-time. But that problem may be solved more credibly, if we properly consider competition in the sphere of capital finance, i.e. the sphere of credit. In this sense, David Harvey for example mentions that \\"the growing power of the credit system in relation to industry also tends to force an equalization of the rate of profit (the connection between profit of enterprise and the interest rate is now very strong).\\"David Harvey, The Limits of Capital, Verso 2006, p. 303). See further Anwar Shaikh, \\"Crisis and distribution\\", New School Economic Review, Volume 4(1), 2010, pp. 72-76. Andrea Salanti stated in 1985 that there is an \\"urgent need\\" of \\"reconsidering the whole methodological foundations of the theory of prices of production\\".Andrea Salanti, \\"Prices of production, market prices and the analysis of the choices of techniques.\\" ¬¥¬¥Metronomica¬¥¬¥, Vol. 37 No. 3, 1985, pp. 241-267. In his major 2016 treatise on the economics of capitalist production, Anwar Shaikh has indeed overhauled the whole theory of prices of production in the light of empirical evidence, arguing that production prices in the classical sense can only be theoretical notions, which strictly speaking do not exist in reality.Anwar Shaikh, Capitalism. Oxford University Press, 2016, chapter 9, at p. 438. What does exist in real capitalist competition are a type of regulating prices, the dynamics of which he explicates in detail. Shaikh agrees with Keynes and with businesspeople, that what matters financially in business, is the relationship between the real rate of interest on capital and the real rate of profit on capital (at the micro level of individual firms and at the macro-level of aggregated business results). According to statistical calculations by Shaikh and Tsoulfidis, the discrepancies between the different empirical measures of product-values, prices of production, regulating prices and market prices which are feasible (using input-output data, labour data and capital stock data) turn out to be, on the whole, not very large.Shaikh, op. cit., pp. 413-416. Theodore Mariolis & Lefteris Tsoulfidis, Classical Economics and Reality. A Spectral Analysis of the Theory of Value and Distribution. Tokyo: Springer, 2016, chapter 3. This suggests that the enormously long Marxist debate about the relationship between product-values and product-prices was, in a sense, unwarranted; overall, the differences between average product-prices and the underlying product-values are, as far as can be established, just not very great.\\"The crosssectional variations in the calculated prices of production are entirely dominated by the corresponding variations in relative values, with between 87% and 92% of the former being explained by the latter.\\" - Anwar Shaikh, \\"The Transformation from Marx to Sraffa\\", in: Ernest Mandel & Alan Freeman, Ricardo, Marx, Sraffa. London: Verso, 1984, pp. 43-84, at p. 73. \\"...measured in terms of their average absolute percentage deviations, prices of production are within 8.2 per cent of market prices, labour values are within 9.2 per cent of market prices and 4.4 per cent of prices of production, and the linear approximation is within 2 per cent of full prices of production and 8.7 per cent of market price.\\" - Anwar Shaikh, \\"the Empirical Strength of the Labor Theory of Value\\". In: Riccardo Bellofiore (ed.), Marxian Economics: A Reappraisal, Volume 2. New York: St Martin's Press, 1998, p. 226. And if the price/value differences are not very great, then Marx was quite justified in mostly disregarding them in Capital, Volume I and Capital, Volume II. Had Marxists been able to measure price-value relationships of products empirically, earlier on in the controversy, they might not have given the issue so much weight; but the econometric techniques to do it were perfected only from the 1980s onward. However, the validity of econometric techniques to measure price-value deviations are still in dispute.Wilfried Parys, \\"The deviation of prices from labor values\\".

Shaikh largely side-steps a more precise conceptual discussion of the relationship between Marxian \\"values\\" and the forms of prices as such, preferring to demonstrate a strong positive correlation between movements in labour requirements and movements in actual price-levels for outputs. His analysis suggests, that the real dynamics of capitalist competition in the sphere of production are indeed remarkably similar to how Smith, Ricardo and then Marx originally described them, even although Marx's theory must be elaborated and modified to complete the classical theory, so that it is fully consistent and can properly explain the economic facts.Gavin Mendel-Gleason, \\"Review of Capitalism: competition, conflict, crises by Anwar Shaikh\\".Spirit of Contradiction, 30 October 2016.;Anwar Shaikh video interview with Ingar Solty, titled \\"Marx and the moon\\", at the Brussels conference \\"Free Trade and the Right to (Not) Migrate\\", 29 Sept. - 1 Oct. 2016. ==See also== *capital controversy *Cost-of-production theory of value *Surplus product *Tendency of the rate of profit to fall *Valorisation *Value form ==NotesSome additional references== *Christian Bidard and Hans G.

Hybrid securities pay a predictable (fixed or floating) rate of return or dividend until a certain date, at which point the holder has a number of options, including converting the securities into the underlying share. Therefore, unlike with a share of stock (equity), the holder enjoys a predetermined (rather than residual) cash flow, and, unlike with a fixed interest security (debt), the holder enjoys an option to convert the security to the underlying equity. Other common examples include convertible and converting preference shares. A hybrid security is structured differently than fixed-interest securities. While the price of some securities behaves more like that of fixed-interest securities, others behave more like the underlying shares into which they may convert. ==Examples== *A convertible bond is a bond (i.e. a loan to the issuer) that can be converted into common shares of the issuer. A convertible bond can be valued as a combination of a straight bond and an option to purchase the company's stock. *A redeemable, or callable, preferred stock confers the issuer to repurchase the stock at a preset price after a specified date, converting it to treasury stock.

In order to qualify, the security must give the issuer the right (or even the obligation) to roll-over the security at expiry to an indefinite or long maturity bond and to suspend dividends (effectively coupon payments, but to reflect the equity nature of the security, the term \\"dividend\\" is used). Most Basket D issuances have been structured in a way that also preserves the tax deductible nature of their interest payments, avoiding double taxation/customs. ==See also== *Convertible security *Convertible debt *Monthly income preferred stock *SWORD-financing, a special form of securities used in biotech industry *Shareholder loan *Venture lending ==References== Category:Securities (finance) Category:Financial markets ","title":"Hybrid security"},{"id":"2219393","text":"Todd Holland (born December 13, 1961) is an American television and film director and producer.

It is one of the most distinctive cacti, a member of the relatively small genus Stenocereus. It is endemic to the central Pacific coast of Baja California Sur, and is found only on sandy soils, where it forms massive colonies. As with all cacti, creeping devil is succulent, and is reported to contain mescaline and sterols. Growth patterns can be widely scattered as individual stems; in favorable localities they can form impenetrable patches of branching stems measuring several metres across. The creeping devil is columnar, with a very spiny stem which is creamy green in color, averaging 5 cm in diameter and 1.5‚Äì2 m long, with only the terminal end raised from the ground. A height of 20‚Äì30 cm is normal since this cactus is recumbent (it grows in a horizontal manner). The large, nocturnal flowers are white, pink, or yellow; usually 10‚Äì14 cm long with a spiny ovary, and flowering sparingly in response to rain. The spiny fruit is 3‚Äì4 cm long with black seeds. Creeping devil lies on the ground and grows at one end while the other end slowly dies, with a succession of new roots developing on the underside of the stem. The growth rate is adapted to the moderate, moist marine environment of the Baja peninsula, and can achieve in excess of 60 cm per year, but when transplanted to a hot, arid environment the cacti can grow as little as 60 cm per decade. Over the course of many years, the entire cactus will slowly travel, with stems branching and taking root toward the growing tips, while older stem portions die and disintegrate. This traveling chain of growth gives rise to the name eruca, which means \\"caterpillar\\" as well as the common name creeping devil. Stenocereus eruca is considered the \\"most extreme case of clonal propagation in the cactus family\\" (Gibson and Nobel, 1986). This means that due to isolation and scarcity of pollinating creatures, the plant is able to clone itself. This is done by pieces detaching from the major shoot as their bases die and rot. Other members of this genus that are found in the Baja Peninsula of California are Stenocereus thurberi (organpipe cactus, pitaya dulce) and Stenocereus gummosus (sour pitaya, pitaya agria, pitayha). While once thought to be threatened with extinction, further evidence showed it not to be so. Transplantation, while not recommended due to environmentally specific factors, can be done successfully with strict adherence to maintaining conditions which mirror the native environment. ==References== * Clark-Tapia R, Mandujano MC, Valverde T, et al.

Females are commonly larger than males. The upperside of both forewings and hindwings is a translucent white boldly veined with black. The underside is similar in the male but the female has brown veining. Moreover, the female loses most of her scales by rubbing her wings together, resulting almost-transparent. This butterfly can be distinguished from other members of white butterflies of the genus Pieris by its distinctive veined wings. The eggs are yellow at first, darkening with age. The caterpillars are greenish grey with transverse banding. The pupa is creamy white, marked with black, attached by a silken girdle to a twig. ==Biology== The flight period of the black-veined white is between April and July. The adults are quite social and their abundance varies greatly from year to year. The eggs are laid on the food plant, usually a member of the rose family Rosaceae and often on trees and bushes (Malus domestica, Malus micromalus, Pyrus communis, Pyrus serotina, Sorbus intermedia, Sorbus hybrida, Sorbus aucuparia, Crataegus monogyna, Crataegus oxyacantha, Crataegus jozana, Prunus spinosa, Prunus padus, Prunus ssiori, Betula spp., Salix phylicifolia, Chaenomeles lagenaria). The eggs are laid in groups of 30 to 100. They take about three weeks to hatch. The caterpillars tend to remain in a group with a communal larval web. This species has one generation each year. The caterpillars overwinter communally in a webbing tent with entwined leaves. Caterpillars feed close together on the leaves of the food plant at first, before dispersing in the later developmental stages to other parts of the tree. The pupal stage lasts about three weeks.Butterfly Guide File:Pieridae - Aporia crataegi-001.JPGMating pair File: 2012-06-27 Aporia crataegi eggs Malus domestica.JPGEggs File:Aporia.crataegi.caterpillar.jpgLarva File:Aporia.crataegi.puppe.2268.jpgPupa File:Winter nest of butterflies (Aporia crataegi).JPGWinter nest File:AporiaCrataegi 2624A0.jpgImago ==External links== * Lepiforum.de * Moths and Butterflies of Europe and North Africa by Paolo Mazzei, Daniel Morel, Raniero Panfili * Pyrgus.de ==References== Category:Aporia (butterfly) Category:Butterflies of Asia Category:Butterflies of Europe Category:Butterflies of Japan Category:Butterflies of Turkey Category:Butterflies described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Aporia crataegi"},{"id":"2219425","text":"Plaque in the Bidlake Memorial Garden Frederick Thomas Bidlake (13 March 1867 ‚Äì 17 September 1933) was an English racing cyclist of the late 19th century, who became one of the most notable administrators of British road bicycle racing during the early 20th century. The annual Bidlake Memorial Prize, was instituted in his memory. He was a timekeeper in cycling, motorcycling and for seaplane races in the 1930s. ==Racing cyclist== Bidlake favoured the tricycle, winning championships and setting national records, often beating bicycle riders. In 1893, he set a 24-hour tricycle record of at Herne Hill velodrome in south London. It still stood when he died. At one time, he held all national tricycle records from to 24-hour, plus place-to-place records, and records on the tandem tricycle. As a member of the North Road Cycling Club, he helped organise a rebel individual time trial, on 5 October 1895, at a time when the National Cyclists' Union had banned racing on roads. Bidlake's Road Record Association records: * 1889 tricycle 6h 55m 58 * 1889 London to York tricycle 18h 28m * 1890 24-hour tricycle * 1892 London to York tricycle 15h 28m * 1892 London to York tricycle 13h 19m * 1893 24-hour tandem tricycle with Monty Holbein * 1894 tricycle 2h 22m 55s * 1894 12-hour tricycle * 1894 12-hour tandem tricycle with Holbein * 1894 24-hour tricycle * 1895 tricycle 5h 15m 57s ==Cycling administrator== Bidlake helped found the Road Records Association and the Road Racing Council (forerunner of today's Cycling Time Trials, the organisation which regulates time trials in the UK), and was vice- president of the Cyclists' Touring Club alongside president George Herbert Stancer. He also timed many time-trials and record attempts over 40 years. ==Founding of time-trials== The early position of cyclists on the road wasn't certain and in July 1878 parliament came close to passing an amendment of the Highways Act by which cyclists would have been banned from the road.Messenger, Chas (1998) Ride and Be Damned, Pedal Publishing, UK The position of cycle racing was still less certain. The custom was for racers to shelter behind pacers, whose job was to \\"bring on\\" their riders, in the phrase of the time. On 21 July 1894, Bidlake was one of 50 in a race on the main road north out of London. He and another rider, Arthur Ilsley, and their two pacers, were passing a woman with a horse when the horse reared and both riders crashed into a ditch. The greatest damage was to the bicycles but the woman complained to Huntingdonshire police that such races should not take place. The National Cyclists Union, fearing action in Huntingdonshire could spread across the country and lead to another attempt to amend the Highways Act, banned its clubs from racing on the road and ordered them to compete on the track instead.Woodland, Les (2005), This Island Race, Mousehold Press, UK Not all riders lived near a track or wished to race there. They set up a rival body, the Road Racing Council, and on 5 October 1895 Bidlake was one of the members of the North Road club who organised a race against the clock. Les Bowerman, who researched this and races that followed, said: :What distinguished them from earlier unpaced races was that the riders started at intervals of two or three minutes in reverse handicap order, the fastest first. Company riding was not forbidden but was unlikely to occur. This would then be very similar to a time-trial as we know it.Journal, Fellowship of Cycling Old-Timers, UK The fact, as Bowerman says, there were unpaced races against the clock before the North Road event in October 1895 means Bidlake can not, as he often is, be described as the founder of time-trialling. Bernard Thompson, a historian of British time-trialling, wrote: :Neither the Road Time Trials Council or the Road Racing Council before them can claim to have invented time-trialling. Without question, time-trials took place a century ago and the National Cyclists' Union national time-trial championship time-trials are recorded in 1878 when A. A. Weir was the victor with a time of 1m 27m 47s on a high ordinary. What the RRC did contribute was 'As great a measure as possible of uniformity in the conduct of road competitions.Thompson, Bernard, Alpaca to Skin Suit, Geerings, Ashford, UK But he was among those who codified a sport which became the leading part of British cycle-racing, even though its officials were so uncertain of their creation that they refused to tell the police, referred to courses and dates in code, held their races in the country at dawn, demanded riders dress completely in black, and banned even the sport's own press from saying when races would be held. Lists of competitors were headed \\"private and confidential\\" until the 1960s. Bidlake's organisation started as a rebellion from the ruling of the National Cyclists Union but it soon became an established part of cycling authority. ==Attitude to other cycling== Bidlake's time-trialling was a rebel's exercise against the dictates of the National Cyclists' Union, but in time the two parts of the sport collaborated. Both agreed that massed racing on the road was undesirable and placed all cyclists at risk. The Isle of Man, which being outside the United Kingdom was not subject to the NCU's ban nor in fear of British police, was proposed in 1914 as the site of a world championship road race. Cycling quoted Bidlake as calling massed racing ‚Äì the sort now seen in the Tour de France ‚Äì \\"a superfluous excrescence.\\" He continued: \\"Unpaced solitary speedmen perform magnificently, unobtrusively, with no obstructive crowds and give no offence. I can't believe that our road men want to alter all this to make a Manxman's holiday.\\" The First World War ended the idea. Bidlake also objected to the way women had begun to wear knickerbockers to ride a bicycle. He said: \\"A skirtless lady on tour is bound to suffer much. She is singularly conspicuous, a centre of observation and exposed to such contumelious ridicule as the ordinary sensitive feminine nature hesitates to provoke.\\".Cited, Woodland, Les (2005), This Island Race, Mousehold Press, UK Women who wore other than skirts to ride a bicycle called what they wore Rational Dress. Bidlake ridiculed it in Cycling as Laughable Dress. When the Cyclists' Touring Club defended a woman member turned away from a hotel because she was wearing it, Bidlake insisted that the CTC was defending not the outfit but the CTC's contract with the hotelThe Hautboy Hotel, Ockham, Surrey, England; the woman was Florence Warburton, a leader of the Rational Dress Society. The CTC pursued the case but lost. to serve any member of the club. Of women racing, he said: :Cycle racing for women is generally acknowledged to be undesirable. My ideal of a clever lady rider is one who can ride far, who can ride at a really useful speed, who mounts hills with comfort, and makes no fuss or show of effort. The stylish, clever lady stops short of being a scorcher, but if women's races were to be organised, the participants would have to run to their limit, or else make a mockery of racing. And that limit is not pleasant to contemplate... the speed woman, dishevelled, grimy and graceless. I believe in a high standard of cycling ability as really worth while attaining by women, but not as racers... Imagine women dressed for speed, on bicycles built for speed, in attitudes necessary for speed, grabbing speed food, taking acidThe meaning isn't clear. It may be a reference to early drugs such as strychnine, which references to the first world championship in Britain (a time-trial won by Dave Marsh of Britain) suggest was known in time-trialling at the time and finishing dead to the world.Should Lady-Cyclists Ride in Races, Cycling (UK), 25 July 1912, p75 ==Other sports== Bidlake took an interest in motor sports and timed a motorcycling attempt on the Land's End to John o'Groats record by George Pilkington Mills, who already held the record on a bicycle and a tricycle. An undated news cutting says: \\"Mr G.P. Mills on his Raleigh motorcycle completed his run from Land's End to John o'Groats on Saturday forenoon and established a new record. He started on his long and trying journey at eight on Thursday morning, and arrived at his destination at 11 am on Saturday, after being 50h 46m 30s on the road. Mr F.T. Bidlake was the timekeeper. Mr J. Silver previously held the record, having done the distance in 64h 29m, and Mr E.H. Arnott in 65h 45m. He has not only beaten the motor cycle record, but is also nearly two hours ahead of best motor car time.\\"Displayed http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/wiki/File:Im040630CTR-Mills1.jpg He was a timekeeper for the Royal Aero Club and in the Schneider Trophy seaplane races of the 1930s. ==Death and memorialGolden Book of Cycling=== The magazine Cycling created its Golden Book of Cycling in 1933 to record those whose contributions to the sport it considered outstanding. That year, 7,000 cyclists at the Royal Albert Hall in London watched Bidlake sign the first page during a concert to honour time-trialling champions. It was the last time most saw him alive.Pedal Club, The Golden Book citation for Frederick Thomas Bidlake. Archive maintained by 'The Pedal Club'. ===Death and Bidlake Testimonial fund=== Bidlake was riding down Barnet Hill, north of London, on Sunday 27 August 1933, when he was hit by a car. His injuries looked superficial and he managed to get home. But he lapsed into semi- consciousness and died on 17 September. By this time, a testimonial fund had been established. It became a memorial fund. Bidlake Memorial Garden A garden and monument, at Girtford Bridge near Sandy in Bedfordshire, was unveiled on 23 September 1934. More than 4,000 watched as W. P. Cook, president of the Anfield Bicycle Club and the Road Records Association, performed the unveiling ceremony. The rector of Sandy blessed the memorial. The garden is triangular with a wall of local stone on one side. In its centre, a stone reads: ‚ÄúThis garden is dedicated to Frederick Thomas Bidlake, a great cyclist, a man of singular charm and character, an untiring worker for cyclists 1867‚Äì1933‚Äù.

London 48 ‚Äì York 148‚Äù.http://www.bidlakememorial.org.uk The balance of the fund was used to create an annual award ‚Äì the Bidlake Memorial Prize ‚Äì for the most outstanding performance or contribution to cycling. Several achievements during the 1950s were not marked by the committee, primarily because they involved riders from the breakaway British League of Racing Cyclists. Significant events overlooked included Brian Robinson's first British stage victory in the Tour de France in 1958 and Ian Steel's victory in the 1952 Peace Race.

He was actually the illegitimate son of Eug√©nio Iturri, a Basque, and Mar√≠a Pati√±o, from Cochabamba. Before entering the mining industry, he either managed a store in Oruro, or spent years in private schools. Eventually, Pati√±o started in mining with Compa√±√≠a Hunanchaca de Bolivia, a silver company, and then with Fricke y Compa√±√≠a. Pati√±o was assigned to collections for the store, and in 1894, he agreed to accept a deed of land in compromise for a $250 debt owed by a prospector. The deed turned out to be for the rocky side of a mountain, and Pati√±o was fired from his job for settling an account in exchange for a worthless piece of property. Legend has it that Pati√±o was forced to pay back the store from his own funds, and was stuck with his own bad bargain.\\"World Tin King Richest Man of Latin- America\\", UPI report, 2 April 1931, in The Daily Courier, (Connellsville, Pa.) The mountain, located near Llallagua, turned out to be richer in minerals than anyone had imagined. Although the first several years of work yielded little, the turning point came in 1900 when Pati√±o located a very rich vein of tin, later called \\"La Salvadora\\" (The Savior). Over the next 10 years he built up the control of nearby mines and other important mines in Bolivia, including Catavi, Siglo XX, Uncia and Huanuni. By the 1920s he had also bought out Chilean interests in his mining company and went on to buy tin smelters in England and Germany. By the 1940s he controlled the international tin market and was one of the wealthiest men in the world, hence his \\"title\\" The Tin King (Rey del Esta√±o). In his 2008 book \\"Outliers,\\" Malcolm Gladwell estimated the total net worth of Simon I. Pati√±o around USD 81.2 billion in 2008 dollars. That amount placed him in number 26 of all time wealthiest individuals in human history, ahead of Bill Gates, Carlos Slim, Warren Buffett and J.P. Morgan. Pati√±o had been living between Europe and Bolivia since around 1912. In 1924, following a heart attack, his doctors told him not to return to Bolivia and he moved abroad permanently, first to Paris, then to New York and finally to Buenos Aires where he died, close to the homeland he was so fond of and wanted so desperately to return to. While living in Paris he was appointed Minister to France and represented Bolivia in 1938 at the √âvian Conference. Pati√±o is without doubt the greatest industrialist Bolivia has ever had. His substantial wealth made him powerful in Bolivian politics and he was locally both admired and hated. Previous to a political shift away from his allies in the government Pati√±o merged the company owning his Bolivian tin property with a British company active in Malaysia. Pati√±o died in 1947 and was buried in the province of Cochabamba, high in the Bolivian mountains of his birth, in a white mausoleum. ==Family== Sim√≥n I. Pati√±o was married to Albina Rodriguez, with whom he had five children *Ren√© *Ant√©nor *Graziella (married to Jorge Ortiz-Linares, a Bolivian diplomat of aristocratic Spanish descent, Ambassador of Bolivia to France during and after the Second World War, parents of George and Jaime) *Elena (married to Jos√© Mar√≠a L√≥pez de Carrizosa y Martel, 3rd Marquess del Merito, Grandee of Spain) *Luz Mila (married to Count Guy du Boisrouvray, parents of Albina du Boisrouvray, mother of Fran√ßois-Xavier Bagnoud who was killed in a helicopter accident during the Paris‚ÄìDakar Rally, together with the singer Daniel Balavoine). Some of the Pati√±os now reside on the East Coast of the United States. ==Epilogue== The Bolivian Revolution of 1952 confiscated the Pati√±o Mines. It is claimed that Pati√±o's son, Antenor Pati√±o, had a hand in the military coup that deposed the leader of that revolution, the then President V√≠ctor Paz Estenssoro, in the 1960s. ==See also== * Bolivian tin belt * Huanuni tin mine ==Notes References == * * * ==External links== * Biographical profile * Fundaci√≥n Simon I.

Its local government area is the City of Stirling. ==History== The area originally formed part of the Hamersley Estate, which also included the suburbs now known as Carine, North Beach and modern-day Hamersley. These areas were owned by the Hamersley family, who arrived from Europe to settle in the Swan River Colony in 1837. The Hamersleys built a summer home just south of Waterman called \\"The Castle\\" in 1865, where their large family, as well as the Perth elite, congregated for summer holidays. Many of the street names in the suburb honour members of the Hamersley family, including Ethel, Margaret, Mary, Ada and Elsie. Originally set aside as a timber reserve, the area was first settled by pastoralists in the 1860s. It served as a stopping point and watering hole along the Coastal Stock Route between Dongara and Fremantle. Cattle drovers frequented the area and Afghan camel drivers were a common sight after the opening of the goldfields in the 1890s. In 1908, the first house in modern-day Watermans Bay was built by a business man come recreational fisherman, Alfred Waterman, who named his house \\"Zephyr\\". The beach front adjacent to his house became known as Watermans Bay, which became a popular fishing spot. The only way into the area at this time was via a wooden block road built by convicts (later Wanneroo Road) and then along a limestone track to North Beach, although numerous tracks through the bushland were developed as time progressed. In 1918, the area was subdivided as the Mt Flora Estates, but initial development was largely limited to holiday shacks. After World War II, the area developed rapidly, and in 1954, the postal district of Watermans Bay was approved. By 1961, nearly all of the existing suburb had been built and settled. === Name controversy === In 1962, the name Watermans Bay was shortened to Waterman because it did not comply with WA state government regulations at the time it was not, strictly speaking, a bay. This move was unpopular with local residents, who lobbied to revert the name. In November 2003, the Geographic Names Committee accepted a City of Stirling proposal to return to the original name following a survey of Waterman households, 491 of whom supported the proposal and 11 of whom opposed it. It is in fact a \\"bay\\", divided by onshore cliffs and offshore reefs to north and south with a wide sandy beach, and a place to launch fishing boats. Star Swamp Bushland Reserve === Star Swamp === Star Swamp Bushland Reserve is a bushland reserve occupying about half of the land area of the suburbs of Watermans Bay and North Beach. The precise origin of the name is unknown, but the earliest known use of the name was on a lease application by J.H.Okely of Wanneroo in 1868. It also has a long history as a Noongar camping area, with fresh water and abundant bush tucker and seafood. Some signs of the people are still there. In 1987, the State Government set aside 96 hectares as an A-class reserve, and funding from the Bicentennial Commemorative Program and assistance from local organisations facilitated the establishment of the Star Swamp Heritage Trail within the reserve. ==Geography== Watermans Bay is bounded by the Beach Road coastal segment to the north, Marmion Avenue to the east, Hale Street to the south and West Coast Drive and the ocean to the west. Star Swamp sits east of Hope Street and represents just over half of the suburb. Reid Highway ends at the southeastern corner, and is the suburb's outlet to the Mitchell Freeway and the Perth central business district. At the 2006 Australian census, Waterman had a population of 1,195 people living in 494 dwellings, with an average age of 45 years (the third-oldest in the northern suburbs). Residential styles in Watermans Bay range from timber and fibro workers' homes to modern two storey dwellings constructed of brick. Due to its small size and surroundings, it is one of the most expensive of the northern suburbs in Perth. View over Waterman from Mount Flora Lookout ==Facilities== Watermans Bay is a residential suburb, relying on a shop on West Coast Drive and nearby shops in Marmion, North Beach and Duncraig for basic commercial services, and nearby Karrinyup Shopping Centre for other services. The suburb contains no schools, but Marmion Primary School is just beyond its northern boundary. Star Swamp Bushland Reserve is accessible from the eastern edge of the suburb. The WA Marine Research Laboratories are located on the beach off Elvire Street, and until recently were the headquarters of the Research Division of the WA Department of Fisheries, which moved to Hillarys in June 2005. The site has since become the home of the department's International Operations Branch. On the southern boundary, on Elvire Street, is the Mount Flora Regional Museum, built in 1936 as a water tower at the highest point of the suburb to provide scheme water to surrounding areas. It was phased out of service in the 1970s, and converted to a museum and lookout in May 1986. It now details the region's history, and is home to the North Suburban Historical Society. ==Transport== Watermans Bay is served by the 423 bus route between Warwick and Stirling train stations, operated by Swan Transit.Northern 62 timetable, Transperth, effective 8 August 2005. Accessed 17 January 2007. ==Politics== Watermans Bay is a reasonably affluent suburb with a large elderly population. It consistently supports the Liberal Party at both federal and state elections. { style=\\"margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 1em;\\" -  valign=top   valign=top   valign=top  -  valign=top   valign=top   valign=top  } ==References * City of Stirling - Star Swamp Nature Reserve * Heritage Council - Star Swamp Heritage Trail * City of Stirling - Mount Flora Regional Museum Category:Suburbs of Perth, Western Australia Category:Suburbs in the City of Stirling ","title":"Watermans Bay, Western Australia"},{"id":"2219483","text":"Osborne Park may refer to: * Osborne Park, New South Wales, a locality of Sydney * Osborne Park, Western Australia, a suburb of Perth * Osborne Park (Willoughby, Ohio), an urban park in the United States ","title":"Osborne Park"},{"id":"2219484","text":": For the Mach variant, see Mach kernel The Perl Object Environment or POE is a library of Perl modules written in the Perl programming language by Rocco Caputo et al. From CPAN: :\\"POE originally was developed as the core of a persistent object server and runtime environment. It has evolved into a general purpose multitasking and networking framework, encompassing and providing a consistent interface to other event loops such as Event and the Tk and Gtk toolkits.\\" ==POE Architecture: Layers of Abstraction == POE, The Perl Object Environment can be thought of as a tiny modular operating system. One or more POE programs or instances can be run concurrently and are generally well suited for cooperative multitasking. The POE package consists of namespaces and abstractions that guide future development of POE in an open- ended CPAN-style convention. ===The event layer=== The informal architecture consists of a set of layers with a kernel on the bottom. This tiny kernel represents the events layer which operates as the main loop of each running POE instance. The first call is to the \\"event dispatcher\\" - POE::Kernel. The POE::Kernel namespace contains a suite of functions which are plugged into the kernel itself. These loop abstractions are designed after POE's standardized event loop bridge interface - POE::Loop. These can be mixed and matched as needed to provide runtime services and a lean facility for interprocess communication. The basic functions are POE::Loop::Event, POE::Loop::Poll and POE::Loop::Select. Also available are POE::Loop::Tk and POE::Loop::Gtk which offer hooks into other loop bridges in the external environment. If that isn't enough, the POE::Loop kernel abstraction provides reusable signal callbacks, time or alarm callbacks, and filehandle activity callbacks as well as administrative functions such as initializing, executing, and finalizing event loops. There is also a higher level packaging framework - POE::Macro and a debugging utility for testing them called POE::Preprocessor. This framework has yielded POE::Macro::UseBytes. :NOTE: As the Perl tradition mandates, POE is also a moving target. Always check CPAN to see what new goodies the community has placed in the archive. (...and remember Perl's Motto: \\"There's more than one way to do it\\" per Larry) The Running Kernel operates through primordial finite state machines constructed from another set of abstractions ruled by the POE::Session architecture. A POE::Session is almost trivially defined as a map of events to the functions, class methods, and/or object methods that handle them. POE::Session objects also contain a storage space shared by all its event handlers, called a heap. Any way you slice them the states are solidly identified and clearly defined. A more featureful event handler is a POE::Session subclass called POE::NFA - an event-driven Nondeterministic finite Automaton (a smarter finite state machine). This event handler moves from one strictly defined state to another as events, polls, user selections, or other external events require. This state machine acts to encapsulate a wide range of generic event driven threads allowing much tighter tracking along the execution path than the relatively informal POE::Session. ===The I/O Layer=== The Kernel's next requirement is for Input-Output handlers that exist in a single I/O layer called Wheels. Wheels initiate actions, handle their resulting low-level events, and produce higher-level events for the sessions that use them. Wheels, like Sessions and Loops are built from a uniform set of abstractions - POE::Wheel - that sit on top of the Kernel. There are seven highly specialized and well-defined Wheels in POE's base distribution: *POE::Wheel::Run - Creates and interacts with child processes using pipe(), fork(), and sometimes exec(). Interaction is done through the child's standard input and output. *POE::Wheel::SocketFactory - A way to create client and server sockets without blocking to wait for their establishment. *POE::Wheel::Curses - A handler for non-blocking input from the Curses text interface library. CPAN components such as Curses::UI::POE and Term::Visual build upon it. *POE::Wheel::FollowTail - Tracks an ever-growing file, such as a log or a collaborative document, by keeping a handle on its tail. *POE::Wheel::ListenAccept - A subset of POE::Wheel::SocketFactory used for listening on existing server sockets and accepting connections from remote clients. *POE::Wheel::ReadLine - A non-blocking, event driven analogue to Term::ReadLine. *POE::Wheel::ReadWrite - A high-performance NBIO file handler for POE that uses POE's drivers and filters to perform buffered read and write on filehandles which draws on the next layer - POE's own little file system. ===The file layers=== Drivers do the actual work of reading and writing filehandles. They are built according to the less abstract definitions contained in the POE::Driver module. The main driver implemented at the time of this writing is POE::Driver::SysRW - a universal filehandle reader/writer designed especially for POE::Wheel::ReadWrite. The next layer, built from POE::Filter and probably the focus of most Perl Obfuscation Efficianados (see POE #POE Humor below), is the POE::Filter set: \\"Filters translate between raw streams and cooked chunks of tasty dada.\\" per \`sungo' *POE::Filter::Block - parses input as fixed-length blocks. On the output side, it merely passes data through unscathed. *POE::Filter::HTTPD - parses input as HTTP requests and translates them into HTTP::Request objects. On the output side, it takes HTTP::Response objects and turns them into something suitable to be sent to a web client/user-agent. *POE::Filter::Line - parses incoming streams into lines and turns outgoing lines into streams. It used to be very basic, but recent improvements have added interesting features like newline autodetection. *POE::Filter::Reference - used to send Perl structures between POE programs or between POE and other Perl programs. On the input side, frozen data (via Storable, FreezeThaw, YAML, or some other serialization mechanism) is thawed into Perl data structures. On output, references given to the filter are frozen. Data may also be compressed on request if Compress::Zlib is installed. *POE::Filter::Stream - does nothing. It merely passes data through without any change. see POE at CPAN for the complete list ==POE Components== Several larger packages have been written in POE according to the POE::Component documentation. These are event-driven modules, many of which act as little daemons that provide services to larger packages to which they belong. Some of them facilitate higher-level communications between modules, especially stand- alone applications that need to remain independent from the main distribution of Perl. In general, POE Components are ready-made high level procedures that perform specific large tasks. A few examples: *Component::Server::TCP - a special-purpose TCP servlet *Component::Client::TCP - a POE-aware TCP client *POE::Component::IRC - a nearly full-featured IRC client. *POE::Component::Server::IRC - an RFC 2810 to RFC 2813 compliant IRC server (under development) *POE::Component::UserBase - a user authentication and data persistence servlet. \\"POE Components tend to be highly reusable libraries that handle tedious tasks, freeing programmers to focus on more interesting things. This should be true for any library, though.\\" ==POE Humor== * The Acme::POE::Knee module on the CPAN. * A number of silly acronym expansions at the end of What POE Is. ==See also== * event-driven programming * Twisted, a comparable framework for the Python programming language ==External links== *POE Home Page (a Wiki site) Category:Perl modules Category:Perl software ","title":"Perl Object Environment"},{"id":"2219487","text":"Mirrabooka may refer to: *Mirrabooka, New South Wales *Mirrabooka, Western Australia ","title":"Mirrabooka"},{"id":"2219489","text":"Maria Grigor'evna Nikiforova (; ; 1885‚Äì1919), was an anarchist partisan leader. A self-described terrorist from the age of 16, she was known widely by her nickname, Marusya. Through her exploits she became a renowned figure in the anarchist movement of 1918‚Äì1919 in Ukraine during Russian Civil War. ==BiographyEarly life and exile=== Born in Alexandrovsk (now Zaporizhia), Ukraine, in 1885, Maria's father was an officer and hero of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878. At the age of 16, she left home and became a babysitter, sales clerk, and ultimately a factory worker, with a position of bottle washer in a vodka distillery. She joined a local group of anarcho- communists. Aleksandrvsk at the end of the nineteenth century. Nikiforova was a teenager during this period. She adopted a strategy of motiveless terrorism (bezmotivny terror), staging a number of bombings and expropriation missions, including bank robberies. In 1907 she was captured, her involvement in these activities leading to a death sentence, later commuted to life imprisonment. She served part of her sentence in the Petropavlovsk prison in St. Petersburg, before being exiled to Siberia in 1910. From there she escaped to Japan. She went from there to the United States, then Spain, and finally arrived in Paris. By 1913 she had become well known by a nickname, Marusya, a Russian diminutive form of \\"Maria\\", though when or how she acquired the name is not known.. She was very familiar with it, using it as a signature and was addressed by strangers with it. In Paris, she married Witold Brzostek, a Polish anarchist and friend, as a matter of convenience. With the outbreak of World War I, she sided with Peter Kropotkin's anti-German position, in favor of the Allied powers. She applied and graduated from a French officer college, serving in the Macedonian Front. ===Return to Alexandrovsk=== With the outbreak of the Russian revolution, she abandoned France and returned to Petrograd. In the city, she organized and spoke at pro-anarchist rallies in Kronstadt. In the summer of 1917, with anti-anarchist activity within the Russian Provisional Government on the rise, Maria escaped back to her home town in Alexandrovsk, Ukraine. Once there, she organized a fighting force of anarchist Black Guards under her command to terrorize the city's authorities, in particular army officers and landlords who refused to cooperate with peasant efforts to redistribute wealth. Alexandrovsk's nationalist government struggled to maintain order under the subversive actions of leftists in general, and anarchists in particular, who exercised political control and popular support to exclude the influence of the Central Rada and redistribute private property. ===Enter Nestor Makhno=== Nestor Makhno (1918), future leader of the Free Territory, was still a minor militia leader when he first encountered Nikiforova When the October Revolution took place in Russian Empire, leftist-dominated cities such as Huliaipole were already teetering on open civil war. There, anarchists gained strength by appealing to peasant enthusiasm for revolution. Upon the invasion of Ukraine by the Red Army, the soviet of the small city issued a decree calling for fighters to join the invasion to overthrow the Ukrainian nationalists. Hundreds of men, mostly anarchists, formed a Black Guard under Nestor Makhno and his brother Sava, and marched on Alexandrovsk. Under siege by advancing Red Army forces to the north, Makhno's anarchists to the east, and subversion by Nikiforova's Black Guards from within, the nationalist army retreated from the city on January 15, 1918. The city shortly came under Bolshevik control. Makhno's forces arrived within days, altering the balance of power in the anarchist's favor. With Alexandendrovsk secured, Nikiforova and her new ally, Nestor Makhno, held a meeting with the Bolsheviks. Backed by their Black Guards, the duo negotiated to become anarchist representatives in the city's new Revolutionary committee. At the beginning, Maroussia and Makhno have allied her on common grounds of anarchism, and later Maroussia has begun to accuse Nestor of ignoring the anarchist ideas. She called him for a bloody struggle against the exploiters and Ukrainian nationalism, page 30, Nikiforova was appointed to the position of assistant deputy, but within weeks Makhno stepped down in dissatisfaction with the group's lack of radicalism. The pair would operate independently as military commanders in the future, but worked closely and often pooled resources in pursuing an anarchist revolution. Makhno historian, Michael Palij, noted that Nikiforova \\"exercised a substantial influence upon Makhno from the very beginning of their acquaintance\\". In the summer of 1917, anarchists unofficially held economic power in Huliaipole, though this was due to underground activity, as officially power rested with the Bolshevik backed soviet in the city In August 1917, Nikiforova seized and robbed a military storehouse at Orikhiv, subsequently attacking, disarming and dispersing the town's regiment and executing all officers captured. However, rather than pass these spoils to the Red Army, they were delivered to Makhno and his own Black Guards. This signaled the end of Nikiforova's loyalty to the committee and Bolsheviks, though she would continue to ally with the Red Army occasionally in battle. She later established a new Black Guard detachment in the other cities, including Elisavetgrad. ===The Free Combat Druzhina=== In December 1917, her Black Guards helped to establish Soviet power in eastern Ukraine cities of Kharkiv and Yekaterinoslav, as well as Aleksandrovsk. In thanks, the Bolshevik commander in the region, Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko, gave her funds to upgrade her detachment, which became known as the \\"Free Combat Druzhina\\". This unit was active in fighting the Whites Guards, the Ukrainian Nationalists, and the Germans-Austro-Hungarians over a large area of southern Ukraine. She was instrumental in establishing Soviet power in the city of Yelizavetgrad (today Kropyvnytskyi) and later was involved in bloody battles in quelling a right-wing revolt in the city. In April 1918, she received a commendation from Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko for her revolutionary activities. The Free Combat Druzhina was equipped with two large guns and an armoured flatcar. The wagons were loaded with armoured cars, tachankas, and horses as well as troops which meant that the detachment was by no means restricted to railway lines. The trains were festooned with banners reading \\"The Liberation of the Workers is the Affair of the Workers Themselves\\", \\"Long Live Anarchy\\", \\"Power Breeds Parasites\\", and \\"Anarchy is the Mother of Order.\\" The soldiers were better fed and equipped than many of the Red Army units. Although there were no official uniforms, the soldiers certainly had a sense of style. Long hair (not common in that era), sheepskin caps, officers' service jackets, red breeches, and ammunition belts were much in evidence. The Druzhina was composed of a core of militants devoted to Marusya and a larger group which came and went on a fairly casual basis. The militants included a fair number of Black Sea sailors, noted for their fighting qualities throughout Ukraine. With their black flags and cannons, Marusya's echelons resembled pirate ships sailing across the Ukrainian steppe. One observer, the Left-SR I. Z. Steinberg, compared the trains to the Flying Dutchman, liable to appear at any time, anywhere. Travelling in echelons, the Druzhina advanced to meet the enemy, which in January 1918, meant the White Guards and the Ukrainian Central Rada. Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko was a longtime ally of Nikiforova's, having met her in Paris years earlier. He provided her with needed political and material support from within the Bolshevik party. Nikiforova was put on the trial twice by the Bolsheviks on charges of insubordination and pillaging: in Taganrog in April 1918 and in Moscow in January 1919. She was acquitted at the first trial, where witnesses were present to speak in her defense. Antonov- Ovseyenko also telegraphed a letter in support of her, commending her revolutionary activities in aid to the Bolsheviks. At the second, she was unable to launch a legal defense, and was banned from holding a political post for a year. Returning to Ukraine, she traveled to Huliaipole, now an autonomous area under Nestor Makhno's anarchist control, dubbed the Free Territory. Unwilling to damage his alliance with the Red Army, Makhno refused to disobey the sentence and would not appoint her to a position in his Black Army, the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine. Unable to command a fighting force for, she worked alongside Makhno by making public speeches, and organizing propaganda events. Antonov-Ovseenko recalled meeting her on April 28, 1919, while reviewing Makhno's troops and the city of Gulyai-Polye (Huliaipole). \\"Makhno introduces the members of the Gulyai-Polye soviet's executive committee and of his staff. Also there is the political commissar of the bridge, my old acquaintance, Marussia Nikiforova.\\" Seeking to clarify rumors of corruption and counter-revolutionary activity among Makhno's ranks and the soviet of the city, Antonov-Ovseenko wrote glowingly of his impression of Gulyai-Polye. His report intrigued prominent Bolsheviks, who decided to visit the city personally. Lev Kamenev and a delegation of Ukrainian politicians, arrived by armored train a week following Antonov-Ovseenko visit, on May 7. Nikiforova met them at the train station, and with other members of Makhno's staff, Boris Veretelnikov and Mikhalev-Pavlenko, offered to escort them into the city. After meeting Makhno and touring the city, Kamenev was impressed with Nikiforova, and upon returning to Ekaterinoslav, he telegraphed Moscow officials. He ordered that her sentence be reduced, from a year, to \\"six months deprivation of the right to hold responsible posts.\\" However, given the overwhelmingly anti-anarchist propaganda among Bolshevik commanders, politicians, and media, Antonov-Ovseenko's attempts to lobby for military support for the anarchists faltered. His political power declined, and he was replaced within weeks of his visit, on June 15, by Jukums VƒÅcietis. ===Capture and death=== In June 1919, Makhno's anarchist armies were outlawed by the Bolshevik command, and came under attack. Facing a two-front war against the white and red armies, Maria gathered a group of fighters, and reunited with her husband Witold Brzostek. Her intention was to field terrorist cells, as a formal fighting force was no longer available. Dispatching three cells on various missions, she took part in a sabotage mission against the White movement in the city of Sevastopol. There she and Bzhostek were recognized and arrested. Tried on September 16, 1919, she and her husband were found guilty and sentenced to death. Both were shot. ==Political positionsAnarchism and revolution=== In her youth, Nikiforova entered anarcho-communist politics and adopted militant tactics to pursue them.: \\"Around the same time she became a factory worker, Nikiforova also joined a local group of anarcho-communists. ... Maria became a full-fledged militant ...\\" Throughout her years of activism, Nikiforova gave numerous speeches espousing her political opinions. However, transcriptions and quotes from her speeches scarcely survived the Soviet era, and she was not known to write her views in letters, essays, or articles. What is known of her speeches is that she was widely regarded for her charismatic oratory, which she used to expound anarchist views. Widely known as an anarchist, she was said to constantly wear entirely black clothing as a symbol of her libertarian philosophy. During times of revolution, she favored immediate and complete redistribution of property owned by wealthy land owners, declaring, \\"The workers and peasants must, as quickly as possible, seize everything that was created by them over many centuries and use it for their own interests.\\" However, while she constantly spoke in favor of anarchist philosophy, she warned against vanguardism and elitism, insisting that anarchists could not guarantee positive social change. \\"The anarchists are not promising anything to anyone.\\" She cautioned, \\"The anarchists only want people to be conscious of their own situation and seize freedom for themselves.\\" ===World War I enlistment=== A French, anti-German propaganda poster. Nikiforova sided with the Allies of World War I and joined the French Army. While living in exile in Paris, she sided with Peter Kropotkin on the issue of World War I, favoring the Allies in opposition to the German Empire. She graduated from French military school at the officer rank and served in the army. ===Conflicts with Soviet authority=== Upon returning to Russia in 1917, Nikiforova was influenced by Apollon Karelin, a veteran anarchist who advocated a tactical strategy of \\"Soviet anarchism.\\" Meeting her in Petrograd, Karelin's political tactics encouraged anarchist participation in Soviet institutions with the long term plan of directing them towards an anarchist agenda, provided these institutions did not deviate from revolutionary goals. In the event that they deviated from a radical agenda, anarchists were to rebel against them. Such institutional cooperation was widely disliked among anarchists, as they were largely a minority within such institutions, rendering their activity ineffectual.. See paragraph \\"On a tactical level ...\\" Nikiforova agreed to ally with the Bolsheviks under special circumstances and negotiated to have herself appointed to a soviet institution, briefly becoming the Deputy leader of the Alexandrovsk revkom. She would go on to help establish footholds for Soviet power in several Ukrainian cities, demanding material support from Bolshevik agents in return, which she then used to pursue her anarchist agenda. Although she would ally herself with the Red Army on multiple occasions, she was constantly at odds with their commanders and personally antagonized several, arguing against some their practices on revolutionary grounds. Upon discovering that a Soviet commander was hoarding luxury goods looted from an aristocrat's home, she angrily confronted him for his selfishness. \\"The property of the estate owners doesn't belong to any particular detachment,\\" she declared \\"but to the people as a whole. Let the people take what they want.\\" ==Public imagePhysical descriptions=== Following Nikiforova's death, several publications described her in terms which placed emphasis on her supposed unattractiveness. Chudnov, a former Makhnovist, wrote of her when recalling a 1918 meeting: \\"This was a woman of 32 ‚Äì 35, medium height, with an emaciated, prematurely aged face in which there was something of a eunuch or hermaphrodite. Her hair was cropped short in a circle.\\" Years after meeting her in 1919, Aleksei Kiselyov described her in his memoirs: \\"Around 30 years old. Thin with an emaciated face, she produced the impression of an old maid type. Narrow nose. Sunken cheeks. She wore a blouse and skirt and a small revolver hung from her belt.\\" Kiselev also alleged that she was a cocaine addict. Nikiforova biographer, Malcolm Archibald, noted that most Bolshevik writers described her in ways similar to this, and hypothesized that this was part of an effort to discredit her ideas with ad hominem attacks. \\"One suspects the Bolshevik memoirists, finding her ideology unattractive, tried to make her external appearance ugly as well.\\" Descriptions of Nikiforova fall into two general categories, either highlighting an alleged repulsiveness, or beauty. An exception to the majority of Bolshevik descriptions, Raksha recalled his 1918 meeting with her in very positive terms: \\"I had heard that she was a beautiful woman... Marusya was sitting at a table and had a cigarette in her teeth. This she-devil really was a beauty: about 30, gypsy-type with black hair and a magnificent bosom which filled out her military tunic.\\" ==LegacyPostmortem mythology=== Throughout her life, Nikiforova had been wounded multiple times, or had been mistaken for dead, only to reappear in good health later. Due to her reputation within folklore, rumors spread in the months following her death that she was actually still alive. Marusya copycats Following her death, Nikiforova's surviving legacy created an opportunity for copycatsfaux Marusyasto appear in the months and years to follow. The only female atamansha while alive, Nikiforova was followed by three women fighters in the Ukrainian War of Independence who adopted her name for propaganda purposes. In 1919, Marusya Sokolovskaia became the commander of her brother's cavalry detachment after his death in battle. A 25-year-old Ukrainian nationalist school teacher, she was captured by the Reds and shot. In 1920-1921, Black Maria (Marusya Chernaya) became a commander of a cavalry regiment in the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine. She died in battle against the Red Army. A final copycat, Marusya Kosova, appeared in the Tambov Rebellion in 1921-1922. After the revolt was suppressed, she disappeared. International espionage rumors Nikiforova was rumored to have become a spy for the Soviet government in Paris in the years following her death. There, it was claimed, she performed undercover work, and was involved in the assassination of Symon Petliura, an exiled Ukrainian nationalist and former leader of the Ukrainian People's Republic. In actuality, Petliura was assassinated by Sholom Schwartzbard. A fellow exile and Ukrainian-Jewish anarchist, and former member of Grigori Kotovsky's anarchist detachment, Schwartzbard had worked alone in the assassination. Malcolm Archibald commented, \\"The only truth in this story might be the fact of anarchists doing the Bolshevik's work for them.\\" ===Treatment by historians=== Nikiforova left few written records or photographs of herself during much of her life. This is owed in part to her hidden activity as an international terrorist. Operating underground, and in exile across multiple countries, Nikiforova did not begin to make her activity public knowledge until the last two years of her life, when she officially held a military command. A few contemporary records of her life survived the Soviet era. Nestor Makhno provided eye-witness accounts of several dramatic incidents in Nikiforova's life within his memoirs. Makhno's former adjutant, Viktor Belash, also wrote of her life within his own records, which were rescued from files held by the Soviet secret police. Briefly a member of the Red Army, Nikiforova's service record exists as one of the few official documentations of her life. Nikiforova has been largely ignored by historians since her death. Soviet-era historians largely erased her from history, despite the important role she played in the Russian Revolutions of 1917 and subsequent civil war. A biographical dictionary of the Russian Revolution includes hundreds of entries, but does not include her. Of the few Bolshevik women who are included, none held military commands as Nikiforova did. There is no scholarly biography of her life, or historiography of her era which mentions her. The few references made to her by Bolshevik contemporaries in memoirs and works of fiction are biased against her. These depict her uniformly as \\"repulsive and evil,\\" with little exception. Nikiforova has also been ignored by non-Soviet historians. Today, Nikiforova remains obscure and uncelebrated within Ukraine. She has been ignored by Ukrainian historians. Critics of this treatment speculate that as an anti-nationalist who fought and was executed by the White Army, Nikforova's activities have been too difficult to rewrite and reconcile to fit a reformist historical narrative. There is little explanation for the neglect on the part of anarchist historians. While several biographies of Nestor Makhno have been published, there is little mention of Nikiforova. This is despite their close collaboration, and her greater contemporary prominence, according to biographer Malcolm Archibald: \\"...in 1918 Nikiforova was already famous as an anarchist atamansha (military female leader) throughout Ukraine, while Makhno was still a rather obscure figure operating in a provincial backwater.\\" Of several anarchist historians who have published histories regarding Makhno, only Alexandre Skirda's work, Nestor Makhno: Anarchy's Cossack, mentions hera single paragraph, out of over 400 pages, is devoted to her. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, historians have attempted to reintroduce individuals expunged from history, such as Nikiforova, Makhno, and other anarchists. Several essays on Nikiforova have been published, and the Nikiforova biography, Atamansha, published in 2007, was based on such sources in Russia and the Ukraine. Nikiforova appears in the French novel \\"Clarisse\\", by Cecil Saint-Laurent. She keeps Clarisse prisoner in her armoured train in Ukraine, and the two women become lovers, Clarisse being deflowered by Nikiforova. ==See also== ;Lists *List of guerrillas *List of military commanders *List of Ukrainians ==Footnotes== . Historian Michael Palij refers to this city as \\"Oleksandrivsk\\". This should not be confused with contemporary Oleksandrivsk, as the city's Russian name formally matched Nikiforova's home city, Alexandrovsk. However, the two cities are located in entirely different regions of the Ukraine. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * ==External links== * *Maria Nikiforova at Libcom.org Category:1885 births Category:1919 deaths Category:20th-century executions by Russia Category:Anarcho-communists Category:Anarchist partisans Category:Executed anarchists Category:Executed Russian people Category:Executed Russian women Category:Executed Ukrainian people Category:Executed Ukrainian women Category:Anti-nationalism in Europe Category:Makhnovism Category:People convicted on terrorism charges Category:People from Zaporizhia Category:People of the Russian Revolution Category:People of the Russian Civil War Category:Soviet people of the Ukrainian‚ÄìSoviet War Category:Ukrainian anarchists Category:Ukrainian guerrillas Category:Ukrainian rebels Category:Ukrainian revolutionaries Category:Women in European warfare Category:Women in war 1900‚Äì1945 ","title":"Maria Nikiforova"},{"id":"2219492","text":"Good Day L.A. is an American morning television news and entertainment program airing on KTTV (channel 11), a Fox owned-and-operated television station in Los Angeles, California that is owned by the Fox Television Stations subsidiary of Fox Corporation. The program broadcasts each weekday morning from 4:00 a.m. to 10 a.m. Pacific Time. The program features news, traffic, weather and entertainment segments (including celebrity interviews ‚Äì which are mainly done in-studio, although are occasionally performed via satellite). The program also features weekly segments on finance, tech, wellness, and food). ==History== Good Day L.A. debuted on June 18, 1993. At its inception, it was a two-hour newscast utilizing the then-traditional 'overnight headlines and traffic/weather' morning news format that was originally anchored by Antonio Mora and Susan Lichtman. Mark Thompson moved from the station's 10 p.m. newscast to serve as its weather anchor; Dagny Hultgreen served as the entertainment anchor; and Suzanne Dunn was the traffic reporter, reporting from the station's news helicopter Sky 11 (now SkyFox). A weekend public affairs show with the same name aired during the 1980s. The format was unsuccessful, and the show had suffered from frequent anchor turnover. Mora left for ABC News and was replaced by Thompson and later Tony McEwing (who has anchored the early morning Fox 11 Morning News since its 1993 launch). Hultgreen was replaced by Lonnie Lardner; Dunn was replaced by Will Kohlschreiber. The show was retooled in March 1995 when Steve Edwards was brought in as anchor alongside Jillian Barberie (now Jillian Reynolds) as weather anchor (swapping positions with Thompson, who took over her former post reporting weather on the station's 10 p.m. newscast), and Dorothy Lucey handling the entertainment reports; Rod Bernsen took over the traffic reports from the helicopter, and McEwing reported headlines from the newsroom. In mid-2012, the show saw its first major lineup change in nearly two decades with the departure of Lucey, whose contract was not renewed in May. Around the same time, Reynolds was offered to work on a freelance basis and began appearing less frequently on the program. Unsatisfied with the demotion, Reynolds chose to leave completely in September of that year. At the same time of Reynolds' departure, frequent guest host Maria Sansone was made a full-time co-host of the program, alongside Edwards. The two were later joined by Araksya Karapetyan who served as a third host/anchor with regular contributions from Lisa Breckenridge, Marla Tellez and Tony McEwing. Both Lisa Breckenridge and Maria Sansone were let go from the show in January 2017 unannounced. For a short period the broadcast was hosted by just Edwards and Karapetyan before the latter was moved to the channel's early morning newscast. Liz Habib then joined as the show's new co anchor. On December 4, 2017, Megan Colarossi joined the show as the new co anchor alongside Edwards replacing Habib who returned to be a sports anchor. The teaming lasted just one week, as Edwards was let go by KTTV. ===Good Day Live=== In 2001, Good Day L.A. spun off a nationally syndicated program called Good Day Live, which was an hour-long version of the local show with the same hosts; the program, which featured the same format as Good Day L.A. (although with more of an emphasis on entertainment news, interviews and feature stories over news headlines), was distributed by Twentieth Television and was originally launched on the Fox Television Stations, the parent of KTTV which operates Fox's owned-and- operated stations. Jillian Barberie was fired from the show and Dorothy Lucey left the syndicated version in 2004, yet both continued to host the L.A.-based version. They were replaced by Arthel Neville and Debbie Matenopoulos. Good Day Live was cancelled a year later due to low ratings. ===Expansion to 3 hours=== Following the cancellation of Good Day Live, KTTV expanded Good Day L.A. to three hours, running until 10 a.m. local time (becoming the first Fox- owned station, and one of the earliest stations not affiliated with the Big Three networks, to expand their morning newscast into the 9 a.m. hour). Also in 2005, Good Day L.A. added a Sunday edition of the program that was hosted by Robb Weller, Nischelle Turner and Elizabeth Espinosa (in July 2006, the Good Day L.A. branding was removed from the Sunday edition and the format was changed to a more straightforward newscast; Turner and Espinosa were reassigned to other news programs, but Weller remained and co-anchored the Sunday morning newscast with Gina Silva until that program was cancelled by the end of the decade). ===Expansion to 5 1/2 hours=== KTTV expanded Good Day L.A. to five 1/2 hours on December 10, 2018, incorporating the morning news program that began at 4:30 a.m. into the show. The 4:30 a.m.-7:30 a.m. part of the show is anchored by Araksya Karapetyan & Tony McEwing. The 7:30 a.m.-10a.m. is hosted by Elex Michaelson, Megan Colarossi, Rita Garcia, Vanessa Borge, weather anchor Maria Quiban, entertainment reporter Julie Chang and traffic reporters Rick Dickert and Soumada Khan. On March 4, 2019 Good Day L.A. changes its Anchor lineup. The 4:30-6:00am part is hosted by Dan Cohen & Rita Garcia. The 6:00-9:00am is hosted by Araksya Karapetyan & Tony McEwing. The 9:00-10:00am is hosted by Megan Colarossi & Vanessa Borge. ===Expansion to 6 hours=== KTTV expanded Good Day L.A. to six hours on April 1, 2019. ==Notable personalitiesCurrent on-air staff=== Anchors * Soumada Khan ‚Äì weather/traffic anchor * Stu Mundel - SkyFox reporter * Rita Garcia ‚Äì 4:00-7:00 a.m. host/reporter *Araksya Karapetyan ‚Äì 7:00-10:00 a.m. host *Michaela Pereira - 7:00-10:00 a.m. host * Tony McEwing ‚Äì 7:00-10:00 a.m. host * Vanessa Borge ‚Äì 7:00-10:00 a.m. reporter/fill-in host *Maria Quiban ‚Äì weather/social media anchor * Amanda Salas - entertainment anchor Reporters * Sandra Endo ‚Äì reporter * Gigi Graciette ‚Äì field reporter * Mario Ramirez ‚Äì reporter * Gina Silva ‚Äì reporter ===Former on-air staff=== * Lisa Breckenridge ‚Äì entertainment and lifestyle correspondent * Dan Cohen - host *Steve Edwards ‚Äì host and news/opinion anchor * Dorothy Lucey ‚Äì co- host/entertainment reporter * Jillian Reynolds ‚Äì co-host/weather anchor * Lauren Sanchez ‚Äì entertainment reporter * Maria Sansone ‚Äì co-host and news anchor * Mark Thompson ‚Äì weather reporter * Elex Michaelson ‚Äì co-host and news anchor (now anchor KTTV FOX 11 News at 5, 6, 7, & 10PM) * Megan Colarossi ‚Äì co-host/reporter *Julie Chang ‚Äì entertainment anchor * Rick Dickert ‚Äì weather/traffic anchor (now chief meteorologist KTTV FOX 11 News at 5, 6, & 10PM) ==KTTV morning newscasts== The station's early morning newscast, Fox 11 Morning News, premiered alongside Good Day L.A. in June 1993; it was originally anchored by Diana Koricke and Tony McEwing, with veteran KTTV reporter and former anchor Tony Valdez serving as an occasional fill-in anchor. Koricke left television news in June 1996 and was replaced on the broadcast by Jean Martirez (who joined the station from KCNC-TV in Denver). The show originated as an hour-long newscast beginning at 6 a.m., but was later expanded to 90 minutes, with a 5:30 a.m. start time. In 2004, an additional half-hour was added, expanding the morning newscast to two hours beginning at 5 a.m. (long after many other stations around the country, particularly in markets as large as Los Angeles, expanded their morning newscasts into the 5 a.m. slot). The morning newscast was expanded to 4:30 a.m. in April 2010. On July 14, 2008, KTTV debuted a half-hour late morning newscast that immediately follows Good Day L.A. at 10:00 a.m. The program is currently anchored by McEwing and Araksya Karapetyan. In December of that year, a half-hour noon broadcast debuted on the station, which was reformatted in September 2011 from a traditional midday newscast to a mix of news and features with Good Day anchors Edwards and Sansone brought in to anchor the broadcast. In December 2018, Good Day L.A expanded from a 3-hour show starting at 7 a.m. to a 5 1/2 hour show starting 4:30 a.m. On April 1, 2019, Good Day L.A. expanded from a 5 1/2 hour show starting at 4:30 a.m. to a 6-hour show starting 4:00 a.m. ==Reception== Critics of Good Day L.A. have praised the show for being \\"so wonderfully bonkers\\", particularly in comparison with its competition, including KTLA's morning newscast as well as the national network morning shows seen on ABC, CBS and NBC. ==In other media== Clips from Good Day L.A. are frequently shown on the E! comedic television roundup series The Soup. The show features their logo and often showcases interviews or funny moments either in studio or from the field. Clips from this show have appeared on late night talk shows like The Tonight Show and Jimmy Kimmel Live! ==See also== *Good Day New York ‚Äì a similar morning news and entertainment program on sister station WNYW in New York City, New York. *KTLA Morning News ‚Äì a competing morning news program on Los Angeles CW affiliate KTLA *Today in L.A. ‚Äì a competing morning news program on Los Angeles NBC owned-and-operated station KNBC *Today in New York ‚Äì a similar morning news program on New York NBC owned-and-operated station WNBC ==References * Category:1993 American television series debuts Category:1990s American television news shows Category:2000s American television news shows Category:2010s American television news shows Category:2014 American television series endings Category:English-language television shows Category:Local news programming in the United States ","title":"Good Day L.A."},{"id":"2219499","text":"In local usage, a burn is a kind of watercourse.

She was played by Jean Alexander from 1964 to 1987. For much of her period as a character in the Street, Hilda worked as cleaner of The Rovers Return Inn. A gossip and busybody, many of her storylines were used for comedic purposes, though the character was equally used for dramatic effect; a scene in which she wept over the spectacles of her recently deceased husband Stan (Bernard Youens) has been hailed as one of the most moving images in television history. Alexander quit the role of Hilda in 1987 after 23 years but was persuaded to reprise the part in 1990 for a one- off appearance as part of an ITV Telethon. She has also been seen in a spin- off video in 1998, in which another long-running character, Betty Williams (Betty Driver), visited her at her new home. Both of these appearances are considered canon to the show. Arguably the serial's most popular character of all time, Hilda was voted the greatest TV character in a Radio Times poll of over 5,000 people. The typical appearance of Hilda, wearing hair curlers and a head scarf, has inspired art and catwalk themes. Despite various producers expressing their desire to see the character return, Jean Alexander was openly critical about the direction Coronation Street had taken, vowing never to reprise the role of Hilda again. Alexander had previously appeared in 1962 as Mrs. Webb, the landlady of Joan Akers (Anna Cropper), who abducted baby Christopher Hewitt (Victoria Baker). ==DevelopmentCharacterisation=== Hilda Ogden, with her trademark hair curlers and pinny, has been described as \\"the classic hard-working class Northern woman. With a voice like breaking glass and a temper to match\\". Actress Jean Alexander explained her interpretation of Hilda's head scarf and curler look: \\"Like Hilda, my roots were in Liverpool and that‚Äôs where I first noticed the curlers and headscarf look. The curlers were put under the headscarf by the factory girls. They had their hair tied up and scarves like that to stop their fashionable long hair getting caught up in the machinery at work. They had the curlers in place in case they got asked out on a date, so they‚Äôd be ready for a night out after the shift.\\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/coronation-street-legend-hilda- ogdens-9047630 Alexander stated in 2010 that she based Hilda on bits of differing, eccentric people she had seen in her youth in Liverpool. A term that has been described as synonymous with Hilda Ogden is \\"busybody\\". Critic for The Guardian, Grace Dent, has suggested that Hilda \\"spent the 70s providing an unofficial town-crier service for Coronation Street scandal. Hilda was known to sleep propped up in bed with one eye open so she could see what time Ken Barlow (William Roache)'s female friends left, (or what time they were carried out in bodybags. Ken's never had much luck with women.)\\". She added that Hilda was the mould that other popular soap gossips were made from, including Dot Cotton (June Brown) from EastEnders, Lynda Snell from The Archers and Martha Huber from Desperate Housewives. ===The Ogdens=== Hilda and her husband Stan were voted Britain's top romantic TV couple in 2002. The Ogdens, Hilda and her husband Stan (Bernard Youens), have been hailed as one of Coronation Street's favourite couples. The bickering pair stayed together through mishap and financial difficulty. A working-class couple, they remained a screen double act for 20 years until actor Bernard Youens died on 27 August 1984, forcing the writers of the soap to kill off Stan on-screen. A scene following Stan's screen funeral, showing Hilda weeping at the sight of Stan's signature spectacles, has been described as \\"one of the most moving moments in TV history\\" and \\"instrumental in winning [Jean Alexander] the Royal Television Society's Best Performance Award for 1984‚Äì1985\\". Neil Marland, who worked as Granada Television's stills photographer for 30 years, has described the scene as terribly poignant, adding, \\"Everyone was crying and the camera tracked in ‚Äì she had to undo his handkerchief, and in it were his glasses. She broke down sobbing. And, of course, I had to do a picture of this. So I left her for a minute or so sobbing. Then, as I got nearer, I just went, 'Jean, Jean...' And she sat bolt upright and said, 'What picture do you want Neil? I'm only acting'. It was just amazing because everyone on the floor was in floods of tears.\\" Commenting on the screen partnership, actress Jean Alexander has said, \\"It was a real pleasure working with Bernard Youens, who played my screen husband, Stan. Any success I have had is really down to Bernard because we worked well as a team and each knew how the other would want to play a scene. It was a happy screen partnership but it was strictly professional. We didn't socialise after work.\\" Alexander has stated that the Ogdens were a brilliant set-up: \\"They were the only couple in the street who were married ‚Äì permanently. They were the only ones who owned their own house where everyone else rented, they stayed together and didn't stray or have affairs and, yes, they bickered among themselves but let anyone else criticise either of them and they would be up in arms.\\" Hilda and Stan Ogden were voted Britain's top romantic TV couple in 2002, in a poll of more than 5,000 people carried out by NTL:Home. They beat off competition from Friends' couple Monica Geller and Chandler Bing (Courteney Cox and Matthew Perry) and Dot and Jim Branning from EastEnders (June Brown and John Bardon). In 2005 the couple topped another poll. The Ogdens were voted ITV's favourite TV characters in a survey by Broadcast magazine, which took place to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the network. They beat Minder's Arthur Daley and Prime Suspect's DCI Jane Tennison, who took second and third place respectively. ===Departure=== After 23 years playing Hilda, Jean Alexander decided to leave Coronation Street in 1987. According to Alexander in 2010, it was the right time to leave as the writers had run out of ideas for Hilda and as a character, Hilda had run out of steam. She added, \\"Her other half had gone and she would have just scraped along. I didn't want that.\\" Alexander went to see the show's producer Bill Podmore to inform him she did not want to renew her contract. Her decision to leave prompted an outcry from fans and a \\"Save Hilda\\" campaign was launched, as many did not realise that the actress had made her own decision to depart. Hilda's final scenes in the programme were aired on Christmas Day 1987, when the locals in the Rovers Return joined Hilda in what has been described as a \\"stirring rendition\\" of \\"Wish Me Luck as You Wave Me Goodbye\\". On-screen, Hilda departed for Hartington, Derbyshire, to make a new life for herself as the housekeeper for Doctor Lowther. 27 million viewers watched. It remains the highest-rated episode in Coronation Street's history. It has been described as the most moving scene in Coronation Street that did not involve a death. The writer behind the \\"memorable\\" episode depicting Hilda Ogden's departure, which attracted a record soap opera audience, was Leslie Duxbury. Since her departure in 1987, various producers have expressed their desire to see Hilda Ogden back on Coronation Street. In 1990, Jean Alexander reprised the role after two-and-a-half years as part of ITV's 27-hour charity telethon. The episode showed her visiting Stan's grave. In 1998, the character was resurrected again, as part of a special direct to video film. However, in 2005 actress Jean Alexander ruled out ever returning to the role of Hilda Ogden, due to Coronation Street's overemphasis on sex and \\"who's sleeping with whom\\". She also criticised the soap for not being fun enough and she disapproved of the modern storylines, saying some are allowed to \\"drag on forever\\". She added: A spokesperson for the soap responded to Alexander's criticism, saying, \\"We don't subscribe to Jean's opinions. Every week 12 million people across the country tune in to be entertained by the drama in Coronation Street.\\" Alexander reportedly declined to return as Hilda as part of Coronation Street's 50th anniversary celebrations in December 2010. They allegedly offered her a large sum of money but her agent Joan Reddin stated: \\"She's not interested in getting involved again.\\" When interviewed in 2010, Alexander further discussed her reasons for not wanting to return to the role of Hilda. She said, \\"It would be impossible for me to recreate Hilda. She would be totally different from the scrubber who left the Street [...] I'm sorry, after 23 years I couldn't recreate that character as she would be now ‚Äì and I didn't want to play her as she was. Hilda would be about 91 now. She left to be housekeeper for the lovely doctor and be part of a village community. She has status now which is something she always wanted. I have changed so I'm sure she has. And I think the fans would be disappointed. It would have spoiled the memories people had of her.\\" ==Storylines== Hilda and her husband Stan (Bernard Youens) were first featured in Coronation Street in June 1964. A working class couple, beset with financial woes and few friends, many of the more established characters looked down on the Ogdens. Hilda worked as a char, cleaning the Rovers Return, Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs)'s factory and private homes, while Stan cleaned windows. Hilda and Stan had four children. Two children, Sylvia and Tony, were not seen on the series with the explanation that they were taken into care when Stan beat them while drunk. Their other children were seen on the programme and were named Irma (Sandra Gough) and Trevor (Jonathan Collins/Don Hawkins). Trevor stole money and ran away within the first six months of arriving on the Street, writing back home to ask Hilda to disown him. Hilda's daughter Irma worked at the Corner Shop and eventually married David Barlow (Alan Rothwell). Irma was crushed when David and her child were killed in Australia in 1970. Irma returned home for a few years, but then vanished, with the explanation being she had moved to Wales, and later Canada. Irma was not mentioned at all when Stan died and in later years, Hilda only ever stated she had two children when asked. She had little contact with her family. Trevor eventually married and gave Hilda and Stan a grandson and granddaughter, but was ashamed of the life his parents led and only made the occasional visit. Lodging with the Ogdens from 1980 to 1983 was Eddie Yeats (Geoffrey Hughes), their surrogate son, and, after Stan died in November 1984 ‚Äì just a year after celebrating their ruby wedding ‚Äì Hilda got extra money by allowing Kevin (Michael Le Vell) and Sally Webster (Sally Whittaker) to live in one of her vacant rooms. Shortly afterwards Hilda's employers, the affluent Doctor Lowther (David Scase) and his wife (June Broughton), made the decision to sell their home and move to Hartington. However, on the night that Hilda helped Mrs Lowther pack away her treasured possessions, burglars broke into the house and violently assaulted them both. Doctor Lowther, who had gone out to get a takeaway meal, was horrified to discover his wife suffering what would be a fatal heart attack and Hilda seriously injured. Although she made a full recovery physically, mentally she became afraid to be in her own home. When Doctor Lowther asked her to move to his cottage in Hartington and be his housekeeper, she jumped at the chance. When Hilda left the programme on Christmas Day 1987, she sang \\"Wish Me Luck As You Wave Me Goodbye\\", in her trademark trilling voice; it was watched by an aggregated audience of 26.65 million people, one of the highest audiences in British television history. Hilda's most remembered attributes were her hair curlers which she almost always wore, her pinny, and her \\"muriel\\" in her living room, which first showed a scene of Alpine mountains but was later changed to a coastal scene with three duck ornaments flying over them (the middle duck, in a nose-dive position, was Jean Alexander's idea). She considered herself clairvoyant and offered teacup readings. ==Reception== The character of Hilda Ogden was very popular with the British public ‚Äî in 1982 she came fourth behind the Queen Mother, Queen Elizabeth II, and Diana, Princess of Wales in a poll of the most recognisable women in Britain.Little, Daran (1995). The Coronation Street Story, p.188. London: Boxtree. Hilda Ogden has been branded as the \\"greatest- ever soap character\\" and \\"loved by millions the world over\\". In 2004 she was voted the greatest soap character in a Radio Times survey of 5,000 viewers, despite the character not physically appearing on screen for 17 years at the time. Actress Jean Alexander commented on the accolade: \\"I'm very flattered. It came totally out of the blue. I knew nothing about it. Friends rang to tell me and I was completely taken aback. I am surprised that so many people remembered Hilda, considering it was so long ago that I played her.\\" She added in 2005 that she was amazed by the nation's enduring affection for Hilda. She said: \\"I've no idea why. I'm totally flummoxed. If they remember Hilda with such affection, then I'm happy and very flattered.. ..It means that I did a good job and that's what I set out to do. I had 23 wonderful years playing Hilda. I worked with some of the Street's legends ‚Äì Pat Phoenix (Elsie Tanner), Violet Carson (Ena Sharples), one of TV's greatest characters, Jack Howarth (Albert Tatlock), Arthur Leslie and Doris Speed (Jack and Annie Walker), all now sadly gone.\\" Various celebrities are known to be among her fans, including Michael Parkinson, Laurence Olivier, writer Willis Hall, the former Poet Laureate John Betjeman and Russell Harty, who formed themselves into the British League for Hilda Ogden. In 1984, a storyline involving Hilda and her husband Stan resulted in monetary claims to the council of an increase of 200%. Off-screen, actor Bernard Youens had become ill, so the writers at Coronation Street excused his screen absence by making Stan have an injury ‚Äì he hurt his toe on a pavement and was bed-ridden. In the storyline, Hilda discovered that if a paving stone is sticking up over a certain measurement, a claim can be made against the council. Hilda sued Weatherfield council and won a payout. Councils all across the UK were reportedly \\"up in arms against Coronation Street\\", because subsequently, claims against them for people tripping up over paving stones that were three-quarters of an inch high, increased by 200 per cent. ==In other media== In 1998 a straight-to-video Coronation Street spin-off film was released. It was entitled The Women Of Coronation Street and featured clips of the show's most famous females. The video saw the brief return of Hilda Ogden, who had not been seen in the soap since 1987; Betty Williams travelled to meet her at her new home. A spokesperson for Granada Television commented, \\"It shows what happens when Betty goes up to visit Hilda Ogden at her home in Derbyshire. She used to do cleaning work for a doctor and when he died he left her the house in gratitude. It'll be a souvenir fans want to keep.\\" ==In popular culture== An image of Hilda Ogden in her signature hair rollers and head scarf has been used in artist David Knopov's series of silk prints. The artist said Lenny Henry, Bill Nighy and Elvis Costello are among the famous names who have bought 'a Hilda'. Hilda Ogden was cited as one of the characters to influence New York's elite fashion scene in 2004. The straightlaced tweed and hair rollers \\"granny chic\\" style of Sixties Britain, much of the look was derived from early episodes of Coronation Street. Fashion stylist Katie Grand said: \\"There's something very interesting about working class Britain in the early Sixties. Coronation Street was black-and-white and so grimy. They just looked so cool. Hilda Ogden has her hair in curlers but is also in a fabulous tweed jacket and a really nice blouse.\\" The video for one of the rock band Queen's music videos, \\"I Want to Break Free\\", was based on characters from Coronation Street. Lead singer Freddie Mercury was said not to be a fan of any soap opera; however, when he was at home he would watch Coronation Street. So, in the song's video, the members of the band dressed in drag as some of the soap's most famous female characters. Mercury's style was based loosely on the character Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), while Brian May's style was modeled loosely on Hilda Ogden. The song peaked at number 3 in the UK singles chart, and remained in the chart for fifteen consecutive weeks from its release in April 1984. In the 1980s, Boy George criticised the most controversial video of \\"Relax\\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood by saying it represented a \\"Hilda Ogden view of homosexuality.\\" In 2017, a longstanding character in BBC Radio 4's The Archers, Peggy Woolley inherits a cat named 'Hilda Ogden', after her hairdresser Fabrice breaks up with his partner and moves to a no-pets apartment. Since her arrival in Ambridge though she proved fierce, and drew blood more than once. == References == Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1964 Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional people from Manchester ","title":"Hilda Ogden"},{"id":"2219513","text":"Prince William. Note the futtock shrouds (white-painted rods angling inwards) and jacob's ladders; extending upwards are the topmast shrouds with their rope ratlines. The top on a traditional square rigged ship, is the platform at the upper end of each (lower) mast. This is not the masthead \\"crow's nest\\" of the popular imagination ‚Äì above the mainmast (for example) is the main- topmast, main-topgallant-mast and main-royal-mast, so that the top is actually about 1/4 to 1/3 of the way up the mast as a whole. The main purpose of the top is to anchor the shrouds of the topmast that extends above it. Shrouds down to the side of the hull would be at too acute an angle from the mast, so struts running out from the mast are added to take the place of the hull for a smaller copy (the topmast) of the lower mast and its rigging. Placing a few timbers between these struts produces a useful platform, the top. The futtock shrouds carry the load of the upper shrouds into the mast below. At the upper end of the topmast and topgallant, there is a similar situation regarding the next mast up (topgallant and royal respectively). At these points a smaller top might be constructed, but it is more usual simply to leave the shroud- bearing struts open, in which case they are known as crosstrees. Access for sailors to the top may be by a Jacob's ladder, lubber's hole, or the futtock shrouds. A foremast might be stepped into a similar fore-top platform on the foremast. A mizen-top would be a platform on the mizenmast. Similar main-top and fore-top platforms have been retained on steam ships and motor vessels as preferred locations for installing rotating radar antennae. == Fighting top == A fighting top was an enlarged top with swivel guns, designed to fire down at the deck of enemy ships. They could also be manned by sailors or marines armed with muskets or rifles; Horatio Nelson was killed at the Battle of Trafalgar by a sniper firing from a fighting top of the Redoutable. == External links == * == Sources == Category:Sailing rigs and rigging ","title":"Top (sailing ship)"},{"id":"2219515","text":"Carine may refer to: * Carine (Mysia), a town of ancient Mysia, now in Turkey * Carine, Western Australia, a suburb of Perth * Electoral district of Carine, in the Western Australian parliament, including the suburb * some species of owls, including ** Little owl (Carine noctua or Athene noctua) ** Rodrigues owl (Carine murivora or Mascarenotus murivorus) * Guzmania 'Carine', a bromeliad hybrid cultivar * Carine (given name) * CARINE, theorem prover, a mathematical concept ==See also== * Carina (disambiguation) ","title":"Carine"},{"id":"2219517","text":"A 1912 Railway Clearing House map of lines around Worplesdon railway station Worplesdon railway station is a railway station in the Woking district of Surrey, England.

The badger game is an extortion scheme or confidence trick in which the victim is tricked into a compromising position to make them vulnerable to blackmail. ==Description== In its simplest form, a badger game proceeds thus: X, a man married to Y, engages in an extramarital affair with W (another woman). During a tryst, Z (another man, posing as W's husband or brother) 'discovers' them in the act. Z then demands money from X to keep the affair secret from his wife, Y. Unknown to man X, both W and Z have been conspiring together against him. The woman may also claim that the sexual encounter was non-consensual and threaten the victim with a rape or sexual harassment charge. Variants of the trick involve luring the mark with the promise of a homosexual act, underage children, child pornography, a bizarre sexual fetish, or some other activity carrying a legal penalty and/or social stigma. In the most typical form of the trick, an attractive woman approaches a man, preferably a lonely married man of considerable financial means from out of town, and entices him to a private place with the intent of maneuvering him into a compromising position, usually sexual. Afterwards, an accomplice blackmails the victim with photographs or similar evidence. Another form involves accusations of professional misconduct. In an example of this form of the trick, a \\"sick\\" woman visits a physician, describing symptoms that require her to disrobe for the examination, require the doctor to examine the genitals, or ensure similar scrutiny from the doctor. During the examination an \\"outraged husband\\" or \\"outraged father\\" enters the room and accuses the doctor of misconduct. The \\"sick\\" woman, who is of course part of the deception, takes the side of her accomplice and threatens the doctor with criminal charges or a lawsuit. This form of the badger game was first widely publicized in an article in the August 25, 1930 edition of the Time magazine. Non-sexual versions of this trick also exist, particularly among ethnic and religious groups with strong social taboos, for example inducing a Mormon to gamble or drink alcohol in violation of his religious vows, and then demanding money to keep the indulgence secret and thus preserve his reputation.Samuel Woolley Taylor (1976). The Kingdom or Nothing: the Life of John Taylor, Militant Mormon. MacMillan, p 199.Charles Kelly and Hoffman Birney (1934). Holy Murder: The Story of Porter Rockwell. Minton & Balch, p. 208. ==Etymology and background== One explanation is that the term originated in the practice of badger baiting. Sometimes the accomplice will simply burst into the room during the act, claiming to be the woman's husband, father, brother, etc., and \\"demand justice\\". The trick was particularly effective in the 19th and earlier 20th century when the social repercussions of adultery were much greater. A famous person known to have been victimized by the scheme was the first United States Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, whose adulterous affair with Maria Reynolds was used by her husband to extort money and information from him. The badger game has been featured as a plot device in numerous books, movies and television shows. ==See also== *Clip joint *Entrapment *Hamilton‚ÄìReynolds sex scandal *The Medicine Man (story) *Romance scam == References == Category:Blackmail Category:Confidence tricks ","title":"Badger game"},{"id":"2219538","text":"Shows Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum through phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. Calcium signaling is the use of calcium ions (Ca2+) to communicate and drive intracellular processes often as a step in signal transduction. Ca2+ is important for cellular signalling, for once it enters the cytosol of the cytoplasm it exerts allosteric regulatory effects on many enzymes and proteins. Ca2+ can act in signal transduction resulting from activation of ion channels or as a second messenger caused by indirect signal transduction pathways such as G protein-coupled receptors. == Concentration Regulation == The resting concentration of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm is normally maintained around 100 nM. This is 20,000- to 100,000-fold lower than typical extracellular concentration. To maintain this low concentration, Ca2+ is actively pumped from the cytosol to the extracellular space, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and sometimes into the mitochondria. Certain proteins of the cytoplasm and organelles act as buffers by binding Ca2+. Signaling occurs when the cell is stimulated to release Ca2+ ions from intracellular stores, and/or when Ca2+ enters the cell through plasma membrane ion channels. === Phospholipase C Pathway === Phospholipase C cleaving PIP2 into IP3 and DAG Specific signals can trigger a sudden increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels to 500‚Äì1,000 nM by opening channels in the ER or the plasma membrane. The most common signaling pathway that increases cytoplasmic calcium concentration is the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. # Many cell surface receptors, including G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases, activate the PLC enzyme. # PLC uses hydrolysis of the membrane phospholipid PIP2 to form IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG), two classic secondary messengers. # DAG attaches to the plasma membrane and recruits protein kinase C (PKC). # IP3 diffuses to the ER and is bound to the IP3 receptor. # The IP3 receptor serves as a Ca2+ channel, and releases Ca2+ from the ER. # The Ca2+ bind to PKC and other proteins and activate them. === Depletion from the Endoplasmic Reticulum === Depletion of Ca2+ from the ER will lead to Ca2+ entry from outside the cell by activation of \\"Store-Operated Channels\\" (SOCs). This inflow of Ca2+ is referred to as Ca2+-release-activated Ca2+ current (ICRAC). The mechanisms through which ICRAC occurs are currently still under investigation. Although Orai1 and STIM1, have been linked by several studies, for a proposed model of store-operated calcium influx. Recent studies have cited the phospholipase A2 beta, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), and the protein STIM 1 as possible mediators of ICRAC. == As a Second Messenger == Calcium is a ubiquitous second messenger with wide-ranging physiological roles. These include muscle contraction, neuronal transmission (as in an excitatory synapse), cellular motility (including the movement of flagella and cilia), fertilization, cell growth (proliferation), neurogenesis, learning and memory as with synaptic plasticity, and secretion of saliva. High levels of cytoplasmic Ca2+ can also cause the cell to undergo apoptosis. Other biochemical roles of calcium include regulating enzyme activity, permeability of ion channels, activity of ion pumps, and components of the cytoskeleton. Many of Ca2+ mediated events occur when the released Ca2+ binds to and activates the regulatory protein calmodulin. Calmodulin may activate the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, or may act directly on other effector proteins. Besides calmodulin, there are many other Ca2+-binding proteins that mediate the biological effects of Ca2+. === In Muscle Contractions === Comparison of smooth muscle and skeletal muscle contraction Contractions of skeletal muscle fiber are caused due to electrical stimulation. This process is caused by the depolarization of the transverse tubular junctions. Once depolarized the sarcoplasmic reticulm (SR) releases Ca2+ into the myoplasm where it will bind to a number of calcium sensitive buffers. The Ca2+ in the myoplasm will diffuse to Ca2+ regulator sites on the thin filaments. This leads to the actual contraction of the muscle. Contractions of smooth muscle fiber are dependent on how a Ca2+ influx occurs. When a Ca2+ influx occurs, cross bridges form between myosin and actin leading to the contraction of the muscle fibers. Influxes may occur from extracellular Ca2+ diffusion via ion channels. This can lead to three different results. The first is a uniform increase in the Ca2+ concentration throughout the cell. This is responsible for increases in vascular diameters. The second is a rapid time dependent change in the membrane potential which leads to a very quick and uniform increase of Ca2+. This can cause a spontaneous release of neurotransmitters via sympathetic or parasympathetic nerve channels. The last potential result is a specific and localized subplasmalemmal Ca2+ release. This type of release increases the activation of protein kinase, and is seen in cardiac muscle where it causes excitation-concentration coupling. Ca2+ may also result from internal stores found in the SR. This release may be caused by Ryaodine (RYRs) or IP3 receptors. RYRs Ca2+ release is spontaneous and localized. This has been observed in a number of smooth muscle tissues including arteries, portal vein, urinary bladder, ureter tissues, airway tissues, and gastrointestinal tissues. IP3 Ca2+ release is caused by activation of the IP3 receptor on the SR. These influxes are often spontaneous and localized as seen in the colon and portal vein, but may lead to a global Ca2+ wave as observed in many vascular tissues. === In Neurons === In neurons, concomitant increases in cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ are important for the synchronization of neuronal electrical activity with mitochondrial energy metabolism. Mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ levels can reach the tens of ŒºM levels that are necessary for the activation of isocitrate dehydrogenase, which is one of the key regulatory enzymes of the Krebs cycle. The ER, in neurons, may serve in a network integrating numerous extracellular and intracellular signals in a binary membrane system with the plasma membrane. Such an association with the plasma membrane creates the relatively new perception of the ER and theme of ‚Äúa neuron within a neuron.‚Äù The ER's structural characteristics, ability to act as a Ca2+ sink, and specific Ca2+ releasing proteins, serve to create a system that may produce regenerative waves of Ca2+ release. These may communicate both locally and globally in the cell. These Ca2+ signals integrate extracellular and intracellular fluxes, and have been implicated to play roles in synaptic plasticity, memory, neurotransmitter release, neuronal excitability, and long term changes at the gene transcription level. ER stress is also related to Ca2+ signaling and along with the unfolded protein response, can cause ER associated degradation (ERAD) and autophagy. === In Fertilization === Ca2+ influx during fertilization has been observed in many species as a trigger for development of the oocyte. These influxes may occur as a single increase in concentration as seen with fish and echinoderms, or may occur with the concentrations oscillating as observed in mammals. The triggers to these Ca2+ influxes may differ. The influx have been observed to occurs via membrane Ca2+ conduits and Ca2+ stores in the sperm. It has also been seen that sperm binds to membrane receptors that lead to a release in Ca2+ from the ER. The sperm has also been observed to release a soluble factor that is specific to that species. This ensures cross species fertilization does not occur. These soluble factors lead to activation of IP3 which causes a Ca2+ release from the ER via IP3 receptors. It has also been seen that some model systems mix these methods such as seen with mammals. Once the Ca2+ is released from the ER the egg starts the process of forming a fused pronucleus and the restart of the mitotic cell cycle. Ca2+ release is also responsible for the activation of NAD+ kinase which leads to membrane biosynthesis, and the exocytosis of the oocytes cortical granules which leads to the formation of the hyaline layer allowing for the slow block to polyspermy. ==See also == *Nanodomain *European Calcium Society == References  Further reading == * Category:Cell signaling Category:Signal transduction Category:Calcium signaling ","title":"Calcium signaling"},{"id":"2219548","text":"Tuckerman Brewing Company is a brewery in Conway, New Hampshire, USA.TUCKERMAN BREWING COMPANY, LLC  Reports from Hoover's Named after the nearby Tuckerman Ravine, the brewery currently produces three year round beers, the self-named pale ale, an Altbier, and the 6288 Stout.

Landes (1924‚Äì2013), formerly Emeritus Professor of Economics and former Coolidge Professor of History at Harvard University. In it, Landes elucidates the reasons why some countries and regions of the world experienced near miraculous periods of explosive growth while the rest of the world stagnated. He does this by comparing the long-term economic histories of different regions of the world, giving priority to Europe and the United States, as well as Japan, China, the Arab world, and Latin America. In addition to analyzing economic and cliometric figures, he gives substantial credit to such intangible assets as culture and enterprise in the different societies he examines in order to explain economic success or failure. ==Content== In The Wealth and Poverty of Nations, Landes revives, at least in part, several theories he believes have been incorrectly discarded by academics over the previous forty years: * The 'cultural thesis' or Protestant work ethic of Max Weber, whereby the values imposed by the Protestant religion on its adherents would have pushed them to value hard work, timeliness, enterprise, free market and free-thinking to a much greater extent than for their Catholic brethren, which would explain the great success of northern Protestant regions such as the Netherlands, Great Britain, Denmark and parts of Germany as compared to southern Catholic nations such as Spain and France. * The 'hydraulic thesis' in Karl A. Wittfogel's Oriental Despotism: A Comparative Study of Total Power, in which despots would control the use of water in order to submit the population to its will. * The 'climate thesis' that posits that tropical climes are, ceteris paribus, poor candidates for development. * Many of the theories of Adam Smith, whose Wealth of Nations is borrowed from for the title. That does not necessarily mean a doctrinaire neoclassicism, as Landes notes that 'comparative advantage' can change over time. He also spends a good deal of effort to debunk claims that the Asian miracle did not happen, was not significant, or was financed by European colonialism, and he draws a correlation between the economic level of a country and the way it treats its women. https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0012_0_11831.html In short, he argues that the vast economic growth of the Industrial Revolution was no accident but instead resulted from several qualities of Europe, including its climate, political competition, economic freedom and attitude towards science and religion, more specifically from certain countries in Western Europe, primarily England. ==Criticism and response== Critics have charged Landes with eurocentrism in his analysis, a charge which Landes himself does not deny; in fact, he embraces it explicitly, arguing that an explanation for an economic miracle that happened originally only in Europe (though he deals with the later 'Asian miracle' in Wealth and Poverty) must of necessity be a Eurocentric analysis, thus siding at least at some level with thinkers such as Bernard Lewis. Following Daniel Bell, knowledge is the necessary link between 'The European miracle' and the American post-industrial society. Landes and Andre Gunder Frank, author of ReOrient: Global Economy in the Asian Age (), are noted for having come to very different conclusions about the long-vie significance of economic developments in \\"the West\\" during the modern era and publicly debated their findings in 1998 at Northwestern University. Additionally, an alternate theory relies on literacy and the gap between Protestants and Catholics as an explanation for the difference in economic results. The economist Paul Krugman remarked in The Trouble with History (article published on his MIT-hosted blog) that the book, while containing an enormous amount of information, offered very few ideas. ¬´ What (does) ... Landes actually believe? And the answer, which seems to me to be damning, is that I am not sure. (...)

He was named to the 1963 and 1965 American League All- Star Teams. In 1965, he was the first black pitcher to win 20 games in a season in the American League and the first black pitcher to win a World Series game for the American League. He pitched two complete game World Series victories in 1965, hitting a three-run home run in game 6, and was named The Sporting News American League Pitcher of the Year. ==Career== Grant signed with the Cleveland Indians in 1954 as an amateur free agent and made his big league debut with the Indians in 1958. His best season in Cleveland was in 1961 when he had a won-loss record of 15-9 and a 3.86 earned run average. In June 1964, he was traded to the Minnesota Twins and had a record of 11-9 for the remainder of the season. In 1965 Grant had the best year of his career. He was 21-7 for the Twins, helping to lead the team to the 1965 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. In 1965, Grant hosted a local Minneapolis variety television program, The Jim Grant Show, where he sang and danced. He finished 6th in voting for the 1965 American League MVP for leading the league in wins, won-loss percentage (.750), and shutouts (6). He also started 39 games and had 14 complete games, 270 ‚Öì innings pitched, 252 hits allowed, 34 home runs allowed, 107 runs allowed, 99 earned runs allowed, 61 walks, 142 strikeouts, 8 wild pitches, 1,095 batters faced, 2 intentional walks issued, and a 3.30 ERA. Grant's home run in the 6th game of the 1965 World Series was only the second by an American League pitcher during a World Series game. 1966 was Grant's last year as a full-time starting pitcher. He spent his next five seasons in baseball as a reliever and occasional starter for five different big league clubs. He and Zoilo Versalles were traded by the Twins to the Dodgers for John Roseboro, Ron Perranoski and Bob Miller on November 28, 1967.Joyce, Dick. \\"L.A. Trades Roseboro to Twins,\\" United Press International (UPI), Wednesday, November 29, 1967. Retrieved April 18, 2020 Grant was the starting pitcher for the Montreal Expos in their first ever game on April 8, 1969. He pitched 1.1 innings while allowing six hits and three runs, starting his season off with a 20.25 ERA, although the Expos would later win the game in an 11-10 shootout that had nine combined pitchers in the game. In 14 years, he had a 145-119 record in 571 games, while starting in 293 of them and throwing 89 complete games and finishing 160 of them, 18 shutouts, 53 saves, with 2,442 innings pitched on a 3.63 ERA. Grant's home run during Game 6 of the 1965 World Series was the only one he hit that season and one of only seven he hit in his entire career. As a hitter, Grant posted a .178 batting average (135-for-759) with 80 runs, 6 home runs, 65 RBI and 37 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .966 fielding percentage. After his playing career ended, Grant worked for the North American Softball League, one of three Men's Professional Softball Leagues active in the pro softball era. He later worked as a broadcaster and executive for the Indians, and also as a broadcaster for the Athletics. In recent years, Grant has dedicated himself to studying and promoting the history of blacks in baseball. On his official website, Grant pays tribute to the fifteen black pitchers (including himself) who have won 20 games in a season. The \\"15 Black Aces\\" are: Vida Blue, Al Downing, Bob Gibson, Dwight Gooden, Grant, Ferguson Jenkins, Sam Jones, Don Newcombe, Mike Norris, David Price, J. R. Richard, CC Sabathia, Dave Stewart, Dontrelle Willis, and Earl Wilson. In 2007, Grant released The Black Aces, Baseball's Only African- American Twenty-Game Winners, featuring chapters on each of the black pitchers to have at least one twenty-win season, and also featuring Negro League players that Mudcat felt would have been twenty game winners if they were allowed to play. The book was featured at the Baseball Hall of Fame during Induction Weekend 2006. In February 2007 during an event to honor Black History Month, President George W. Bush honored Grant and fellow Aces, Ferguson Jenkins, Dontrelle Willis and Mike Norris, and the publication of the book, at the White House. On April 14, 2008, he threw out the ceremonial opening pitch at Progressive Field to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his major league debut. Grant was also awarded the key to the city to honor the occasion. Grant was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary's Shrine of the Eternals in 2012.\\"Shrine of the Eternals ‚Äì Inductees\\".

The Erfurt Union () was a short-lived union of German states under a federation, proposed by the Kingdom of Prussia at Erfurt, for which the Erfurt Union Parliament (Erfurter Unionsparlament), lasting from March 20 to April 29, 1850, was opened at the former Augustinian monastery in Erfurt.Blackbourn, David (1997) The Long Nineteenth Century: A History of Germany, 1780-1918, Oxford: Oxford University PressGunter Mai, [2000] Die Erfurter Union und das Erfurter Unionsparlament 1850. K√∂ln: B√∂hlau The union never came into effect, and was seriously undermined in the Punctation of Olm√ºtz (November 29, 1850; also called the Humiliation at Olm√ºtz) under immense pressure from the Austrian Empire. ==Conception of the Union== In the Revolutions of 1848, the Austrian-dominated German Confederation was dissolved, and the Frankfurt Assembly sought to establish new constitutions for the multitude of German states. The effort, however, ended in the Assembly's collapse, after King Frederick William IV refused the German crown. The Prussian government, under the influence of General Joseph Maria von Radowitz, who sought to unite the landed classes against the threat to Junker domination, seized the opportunity to initiate a new German federation under the leadership of the Hohenzollern monarch. At the same time, Frederick William IV acceded to his people's demands for a constitution, also agreeing to become leader of a united Germany. A year before the convention of the Erfurt Union Parliament, the May 26, 1849 Alliance of the Three Kings was concluded between Prussia, Saxony and Hanover, the latter two of which explicitly made the reservation of departure unless all other principalities with the exception of Austria joined. From this treaty sprung the Prussian policy of fusion, and thence the ambition of the Erfurt Union, which in its constitution abandoned universal and equal franchise in favour of the traditional three-class franchise. The constitution itself, however, was only to come into effect after revision and ratification by an elected Reichstag, as well as approval by the participating governments. 150 former liberal deputies to the German national assembly had acceded to the draft at a meeting in Gotha on June 25, 1849, and by the end of August 1849, almost all (twenty-eight) principalities had recognised the Reich constitution and joined the union, due in varying degrees to Prussian pressure. ==Inceptive problems== St. Augustine's Monastery Despite this, elections to the Erfurt parliament, held in January 1850, received very little popular support, or even recognition. Democrats universally boycotted the election, and with electoral participation below 50%, Saxony and Hanover exercised their reservation to leave the Alliance of Three Kings. No government in the end agreed to the constitution, and even though the document was readily accepted by the Gotha Party (incidentally narrowly defeated in the elections), it never took effect. The Erfurt parliament never materialised. Meanwhile, Austria, having overcome its difficulties ‚Äì the fall of Metternich, the abdication of Ferdinand I, and constitutional revolts in Italy and Hungary ‚Äì began a renewed active resistance against Prussia's union plan. The Saxon and Hanoverian withdrawals from their alliance with Prussia can also be attributed in part to Austrian encouragement. Vienna contemplated restoration of the German Confederation recalling the German Diet, and rallied the Prussian nobility and feudal-corporate and anti-national groups around the Prussian General Ludwig Friedrich Leopold von Gerlach to increasingly successfully oppose Union policy. In Prussia itself, a congress of princes held in Berlin in May 1850 explicitly decided against the merits of introducing a constitution at the point in time. Following the Prussian king's (and his ministers') weakening volition for German unification, Radowitz's influence declined. Prussia's union policy was further weakened by Austrian urges for the restoration of the Federal Assembly in Frankfurt in September the same year. ==Prussian humiliation== The Prussia‚ÄìAustria conflict worsened by autumn that year, as disagreements over the question of federal executions in Holstein (dispute with Denmark) and the Electorate of Hesse almost escalated into a military conflict. Since 1848 the Austrians had been allied with the Russian Empire; after the Berlin government refused Austrian demands at the Warsaw Conference of October 28, 1850, the souring relations degenerated further on Prussia's November 5 announcement that it was mobilising its army and preparing for war, in response to troops of the German Confederation advancing into the Electorate of Hesse. War was avoided when Prussian leaders closely associated with the nobility threw their support behind Gerlach with the , known informally as the Kreuzzeitungspartei after the Kreuzzeitung newspaper, which supported Austria in advocating a return to the Confederation. ==Punctation of Olm√ºtz== On November 29, 1850, the Treaty of Olm√ºtz was concluded between Austria and Prussia with Russian participation. The treaty, seen by many as a humbling capitulation on Prussia's part to the Viennese Hofburg, saw Prussia submitting to the Confederation, reversing tack to demobilise, agreeing to partake in the intervention of the German Diet in Hesse and Holstein and renouncing any resumption of her union policy, and hence abandoning the Erfurt Union. == References  *Erfurter Union, J.

Valverde's biggest wins have been the Vuelta a Espa√±a in 2009, Crit√©rium du Dauphin√© in 2008 and 2009, Tour of the Basque Country in 2017, Volta a Catalunya in 2009, 2017 and 2018, Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge in 2006, 2008, 2015 and 2017, La Fl√®che Wallonne in 2006, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, the Cl√°sica de San Sebasti√°n in 2008 and 2014, the 2006 and 2008 UCI ProTours, the 2014 and 2015 UCI World Tours, and the road race in the 2018 World Championships. Overall, Valverde has 127 professional wins. Prior to his Worlds win, he already held the record for most medals won at World Championships ‚Äì he twice collected the silver medal in the World Championships, in 2003 and 2005, as well as the bronze four times in 2006, 2012, 2013 and 2014. As of 2019, Valverde has placed in the Top 10 of a Grand Tour nineteen times. Valverde is rare in combining different specialities in road bicycle racing, being a strong climbing specialist, sprinter and a good time-trialist. The online database Cycling Ranking ranks him as the 4th best cyclist of all time. After a lengthy court battle, he was suspended for two years as part of the Operaci√≥n Puerto blood doping investigation, but he returned to competition in 2012 upon completion of the ban. All his results from 2010 were stripped, including the overall win in the 2010 Tour de Romandie, and he did not compete in 2011. == Biography == Born in Las Lumbreras, Murcia, Valverde came from a cycling family, his father Juan was an amateur bicycle racer and bought him a bike when he was six years old. His brother Juan Francisco was also an amateur road racing cyclist. Valverde's first race was in Jumilla, in his region of Murcia, and he finished second. On the following week he won his second race in Yecla. He allegedly took more than fifty consecutive victories between 11 and 13 years old, earning him the nickname El Imbatido (The Unbeaten). === Amateur career === Due to his many wins, Valverde was offered to ride for the elite amateur team Banesto based in Navarre, some distance away from his home in Murcia. Perhaps due to the exhaustion from having to travel back and forth every weekend, his performance suffered while with the team. He moved to the development team of the professional squad and was coached by Francisco Moya, whom he credited with helping him become a better cyclist. Kelme also promised to allow him to move to the professional squad if he showed good performance. At the end of his first season with the Kelme amateur squad, they offered to move him to the professional squad. === Kelme (2002‚Äì2004) === Valverde turned professional in 2002 when he signed a contract with the Spanish team , with whom he stayed until the end of the 2004 season. During his time with Kelme he had a breakthrough year in the 2003 Vuelta a Espa√±a, where he won two stages and finished third in the General classification. That year he also won the Vuelta a Mallorca and a stage in Tour of the Basque Country and other Spanish races like GP Primavera and GP Villafranca de Ordizia. He ended the season with a second place in the 2003 UCI Road World Championships behind Igor Astarloa after winning the sprint ahead of Peter Van Petegem and Paolo Bettini. In the 2004 season he decided to stay with Kelme despite the team's financial woes and offers from other teams. He went on to win the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana, the Vuelta a Murcia, a stage in the Tour of the Basque Country, the Vuelta a Burgos and taking fourth in the Vuelta a Espa√±a. Although he won a stage in the Vuelta, he was injured in a crash that forced him to downscale his ambitions in the overall classification. He also participated in the Summer Olympics. === Caisse d'Epargne/Movistar (2005‚Äìpresent) === 2005 Valverde at the 2005 Tour de France Valverde joined the UCI ProTeam in 2005. He won the last stage in Paris‚ÄìNice and finished second overall behind Bobby Julich. He also took two stages in the Tour of the Basque Country. In his first ever appearance at the Tour de France, he won the 10th stage of the Tour de France ahead of Lance Armstrong, whom he beat in the sprint into Courchevel at the end of a mountain stage in the Alps. After Stage 12, he was in 5th place on GC, 3 minutes and 16 seconds behind Armstrong. He was also leading in the young rider classification (white jersey), with a 3-minute and 9 second lead on Armstrong's teammate Yaroslav Popovych. However, Valverde was forced to withdraw from the Tour during the 13th stage because of a knee injury. Valverde recovered barely in time for the UCI Road World Championships in Madrid, Spain. The injury of √ìscar Freire, who was the Spanish team captain, forced him to become the team leader, despite having had only one day of competition before the Worlds. Amazingly, he was able to be competitive and finished second to winner Tom Boonen.  2006  Valverde at the 2006 Tour de France In 2006, Valverde won a stage in the Tour of the Basque Country, finishing 2nd overall and capturing the points competition. He then completed a prestigious double in the Spring classics, winning La Fl√®che Wallonne and taking victory four days later at Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge. Valverde subsequently won a stage in the Tour de Romandie finishing 3rd overall. Valverde planned to challenge at the 2006 Tour de France, and stated that he hoped to win in the future. He went to the Pinarello bicycle factory in Treviso, Italy, to optimize his time-trialing performance. In fact he started among the favourites for the Tour after the withdrawal of Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso due to a doping investigation. However, on the third stage of the race, Valverde crashed, and had to abandon the Tour with a fractured right collarbone. His ambition to win a Grand Tour shifted to the Vuelta a Espa√±a, later that year. Valverde entered the Vuelta a Espa√±a as the top favorite. Since he did not ride a full Tour de France he was in better condition than some of the other candidates for the victory: defending champion Denis Menchov and Carlos Sastre both ended in the top 10 of the Tour de France and were expected to be somewhat fatigued. Valverde won the 7th stage and dominated mountain stages, earning him the gold leader jersey after stage 9. Valverde lost the jersey however due to the aggressive climbing and attacking of Alexander Vinokourov. In the last time trial, Valverde again lost time on Vinokourov and had to settle for the 2nd place in the overall standings, his second podium finish in a Grand Tour. Following his impressive performance in the Vuelta, Valverde won yet another major title, winning the UCI ProTour with several major races still left on the calendar as his point lead had reached unassailable levels. At the UCI Road World Championships, Valverde was considered one of the favorites for the title. Although he did not win, he was able to finish 3rd and claim a bronze medal.  2007  He started 2007 by winning the overall classification at Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana and Vuelta a Murcia. In stage 4 of the Vuelta a Murcia, Valverde accomplished his first win in an individual time trial. He also finished third in the Crit√©rium International and fifth in the Tour of the Basque Country. In the Ardennes classics he took second place in both La Fl√®che Wallonne and Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge, unable to repeat the double victory of 2006 season. In the Tour de France, Valverde was seen as one of the favorites for the yellow jersey until he had a disastrous individual time trial that diminished his chances of fighting for the overall classification. He subsequently finished sixth overall, eleven minutes behind, and thus finished his first Tour de France after being unable to complete the race in 2005 and 2006. He decided not to race the Vuelta a Espa√±a in order to prepare for the UCI Road World Championships. On 29 August 2007, the UCI announced that they prevented Valverde from riding the World Championships in Stuttgart because of his possible implication in the Operaci√≥n Puerto doping case to safeguard the atmosphere and reputation of the World Championships. The UCI also called upon the Spanish Cycling Federation (RFEC) to open disciplinary proceedings against the rider, but RFEC refused to comply with the UCI's request, saying there was no new evidence against him. RFEC also included Valverde in its squad for the World Championships, where he ended up 2nd. The matter was taken to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which authorised Valverde to participate in the World Championships.  2008  Valverde at the 2008 Vuelta a Espa√±a, wearing the blue jersey of points classification leader. In 2008, Valverde showed strong form in the spring. After winning the Vuelta a Murcia, Valverde was focused on training. He announced his readiness with a podium finish in the Klasika Primavera and a triumph at the Paris‚ÄìCamembert. These successes foreshadowed excellent results in the Ardennes classics: a podium at the Amstel Gold Race and victory in Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge. Valverde also won the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√© Lib√©r√© and the Spanish National Road Race Championships in June. On 5 July, Valverde won the first stage of the Tour de France. His form faltered in the Pyrenees, and after being dropped on the Col du Tourmalet, eventually losing 5' 52\\" to stage winner Leonardo Piepoli, scrapping hopes of a podium finish. He performed better in the Alps and claimed a top ten finish. On Alpe d'Huez it appeared that he was working alongside to try to eliminate Cadel Evans. He followed the Tour with a strong victory in the Cl√°sica de San Sebasti√°n, leading out the sprint and holding off Alexandr Kolobnev and Davide Rebellin. Later, at the Vuelta a Espa√±a, he started strong, winning the second stage and wearing the general classification leader's jersey on the third one. He was among the leaders in the first week. However, he lost around two minutes on a very wet stage to Saunces and any chance of a podium finish. However, he ended up in fourth position overall at the end with some strong performances including an impressive ride up the Angliru, where he was only bettered by Alberto Contador and then a good performance in the mountain time-trial. Before the participation at the UCI Road World Championships at Varese, he was mathematically proclaimed the UCI ProTour winner, being his second win in the four editions of the competition.  2009  Valverde wearing the leader's jersey at the 2009 Vuelta a Espa√±a Valverde started 2009 in good form by taking the points and mountains classifications in the Vuelta a Castilla y Le√≥n while finishing 9th overall with two stage victories. He could not repeat his successes of the last few years in the spring classics with his best result being a 7th at La Fl√®che Wallonne. He won the Klasika Primavera and the Volta a Catalunya to put those disappointments behind him. With the threat of not racing the Tour de France hanging over his head he entered the Crit√©rium du Dauphin√© Lib√©r√© hoping to prove his worth. He performed consistently throughout the two early time-trials to stay in touch with the leaders before finishing second on Mont Ventoux to take the lead in the overall classification. Though Cadel Evans repeatedly attacked him in the final days he stayed on his wheel, with the help of compatriot Alberto Contador, to take the yellow jersey. On the back of these successes he appealed his ban by the Italian authorities with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in the hope of racing the tour. On 20 September 2009, Valverde clinched the overall victory in the Vuelta a Espa√±a. Despite having no stage victories, Valverde's consistency in the mountains allowed him to keep his race all the way to end that he captured on stage 9.  2010  All his 2010 results were annulled because of the suspension.  2012  Valverde at the 2012 Tour de France; he won the seventeenth stage of the race. Valverde made his return to the peloton during the Tour Down Under, the first race of the UCI World Tour season. He won the race's fifth stage ‚Äì the queen stage of the event ‚Äì by out- sprinting 's Simon Gerrans in a two-man sprint in Willunga, and finished second overall. He earned his first overall victory since his return, by winning February's Vuelta a Andaluc√≠a, as well as achieving a stage victory during the race. Valverde also finished third in Paris‚ÄìNice, and by winning stage 3 showed good form for the upcoming Tour de France. In the Tour de France he sat casually in the peloton until initiating a breakaway in stage 17, which he held onto after breaking away from the other 16 riders in the breakaway. almost chased him down, ending only 19 seconds adrift; it was Valverde's fourth Tour de France stage victory. Valverde entered the Vuelta a Espa√±a as a lieutenant to the defending champion Juan Jos√© Cobo in the . However, Valverde would soon become the leader when it became apparent that Cobo was not in top form. His started off with a victory in the first stage, a team time trial. Valverde would take the lead of the general, points and combination classifications after winning Stage 3, in which he chased down repeated attacks from Alberto Contador and outsprinted Joaquim Rodr√≠guez at the finishing line. He would subsequently lose the lead to Rodr√≠guez, but won the eighth stage atop the Collada de la Gallina in Andorra. Contador broke away from the small lead group and looked like he was heading for the win, but Rodr√≠guez and Valverde passed him with less than to go, with Valverde taking the win. Valverde ultimately finished the Vuelta in second position overall after being a constant threat for the leader, which was Rodr√≠guez until stage 17 where Contador soloed to victory and grabbed the lead, which he would not relinquish. Valverde won both the points and combination classification jerseys on the final day from Rodr√≠guez as a result of a sixth-place finish on the very last stage in Madrid. Valverde had to settle for a bronze medal in the World Championships in Valkenburg, as he was unable to reach Philippe Gilbert who attacked on the final climb of the Cauberg. He was the first of a group of 27 riders who had a five seconds deficit on the Belgian when crossing the line. He was supposed to participate in the Giro di Lombardia, but announced on the morning of the race that he was suffering from influenza and was putting an end to his 2012 season.  2013  points classification leader, at the 2013 Vuelta a Espa√±a As in 2012, Valverde won the overall classification of the Vuelta a Andaluc√≠a in 2013, where he also won the points classification in the race. Valverde continued showing some good form after finishing with podium places in the Vuelta a Murcia, the Amstel Gold Race and in Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge. After having a decent spring campaign, Valverde aimed for a podium finish in the Tour de France. Valverde started the Tour in good form after finishing third in Ax3 Domaines behind Chris Froome and Richie Porte. However the next day, Porte lost over 15 minutes which moved Valverde into second overall right before the tour left the Pyrenees. On Stage 13, Valverde lost almost 10 minutes after getting a flat tyre. Despite a very hard pursuit, the high crosswinds and the pace of the peloton prevented him and his teammates from catching back. They ended up with the second group at the finish causing him to slip out of the top ten.

The following Wednesday he took his third consecutive La Fl√®che Wallonne victory and became the most prolific winner of the \\"smaller\\" Ardennes Classic with his fourth win. He showed his climbing prowess by controlling up until the last when he accelerated away from his rivals to take the victory. The Sunday following, he went out to repeat his Ardennes double from 2015 by securing another Li√®ge‚ÄìBastogne‚ÄìLi√®ge win but he fell short and only managed to finish 16th. Valverde at the 2016 Tour de France Valverde was named in the start list for the Giro d'Italia, his first participation in the Italian race. Valverde rode a consistent race but struggled in the high mountains especially on the queen stage in the Dolomites where he lost more than three minutes. He fought back the very next day with a third place in the mountain time trial and managed to win his first Giro d'Italia stage the day after the rest day in Andalo, his 14th stage win over the three Grand Tours. He secured his spot on the podium by outclimbing Steven Kruijswijk on the very last mountain stage and finished third overall, becoming only the 16th cyclist to finish on the podium in each of the three Grand Tours. Later that year, by finishing sixth in the Tour de France, Valverde made it nine consecutive top 10 finishes in his last nine grand tour starts, a feat that had not happened since the days of Miguel Indur√°in.  2017  In February 2017 Valverde took his first win of the season at the Vuelta a Murcia, a race that he had previously won four times. He followed this up with a win in the Vuelta a Andaluc√≠a for the fifth time in six years, defeating runner-up Alberto Contador by a single second and winning stage one in the process. The overall win was the 100th victory in Valverde's career. After not starting Paris‚ÄìNice due to illness, Valverde went on to dominate the Volta a Catalunya by winning stages three, five, and seven and beating runner- up Contador by over a minute. This was done in spite of him and his team being given a one-minute penalty for \\"pushes\\" in the opening team time trial. At the Tour of the Basque Country, Valverde won stage five and went into the final day's individual time trial as the race leader, albeit on the same time as 's Rigoberto Ur√°n and Michael Woods, 's Romain Bardet, and ' Louis Meintjes, along with having just a three-second advantage over Contador.

He managed to put time into the rest of his general classification rivals, including Contador, Bardet, and most notably, defending champion Chris Froome (). Over the subsequent mountain stages, Valverde was consistently aggressive, however it failed to pay off and by the end of the Dauphin√© he was 4 minutes 8 seconds down on 's Jakob Fuglsang, in ninth place overall. Going into the Tour de France, Valverde stated that he would work for his teammate Nairo Quintana, however he was still considered an outside bet for the final podium by many pundits. On the opening individual time trial stage, Valverde crashed on a tight corner and was forced to abandon the Tour immediately; his first Grand Tour withdrawal since 2006. He suffered a fractured kneecap, ruling him out for several months.

It uncovered doping products, bags of blood and human plasma, and code names that appeared to link top athletes, including up to 60 cyclists, to a highly organized system of doping, which relied heavily on blood transfusions. Valverde was not initially linked in the investigation, but documents from Madrid's Court 31 linked Valverde to a single bag of human plasma of the 211 total bags of blood and plasma seized in the investigation. The bag of human plasma was labelled with the codes Valv, Piti and 18. In 2007 Valverde was banned by the International Cycling Union (UCI) from competing in the UCI Road World Championships in Stuttgart but Valverde was cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport to compete at the championships.See 2007 season section for further information. Dick Pound, World Anti-Doping Agency president, said the CAS decision did not mean that Valverde was no longer a suspect. In early 2009 the Italian National Olympic Committee matched DNA samples taken from Valverde during a rest day in Italy of the 2008 Tour de France to plasma seized in the Operaci√≥n Puerto investigation. At a February 2009 appearance in front of the Olympic Committee, Valverde maintained his innocence and questioned the Italians' jurisdiction over this case. In May 2009, the Italian Olympic Committee suspended him from competition in Italy for 2 years, effectively barring him from the 2009 Tour de France, which detoured briefly onto Italian soil.Prosecutor Recommends 2 Year Ban SI.com, 1 April 2009 Valverde filed an unsuccessful appeal against the Italian ban with the Court of Arbitration for Sport; in a second hearing on 18‚Äì21 March 2010, the UCI and WADA contested the Spanish Cycling Federation's decision not to open a case against Valverde. Finally, on 31 May 2010 it was announced the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld the appeals from WADA and the UCI and Valverde was banned for two years, starting 1 January 2010, but rejected the request that any results obtained by the athlete prior to the beginning of the suspension be annulled. After serving the two-year suspension Alejandro Valverde returned to competition in 2012 riding for the . == Career achievements Awards=== * V√©lo d'Or: 2018 == Notes  References  External links == *Caisse d'Epargne's Official Website profile * * *Alejandro Valverde at Cycling Ranking Category:1980 births Category:Cyclists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2012 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Doping cases in cycling Category:Spanish sportspeople in doping cases Category:Living people Category:Olympic cyclists of Spain Category:Spanish male cyclists Category:Spanish Tour de France stage winners Category:Spanish Vuelta a Espa√±a stage winners Category:People from Huerta de Murcia Category:Giro d'Italia cyclists Category:Tour de France cyclists Category:Vuelta a Espa√±a cyclists Category:Vuelta a Espa√±a winners Category:2014 Vuelta a Espa√±a stage winners Category:Murcian cyclists Category:Spanish Giro d'Italia stage winners Category:UCI Road World Champions (elite men) Category:Mediterranean Games bronze medalists for Spain Category:Mediterranean Games medalists in cycling Category:Competitors at the 2001 Mediterranean Games Category:UCI ProTour winners Category:UCI World Tour winners ","title":"Alejandro Valverde"},{"id":"2219632","text":"Heavens Above! is a 1963 British satirical comedy film starring Peter Sellers, directed by John and Roy Boulting, who also co-wrote along with Frank Harvey, from an idea by Malcolm Muggeridge. It is in much the same vein as the earlier collaboration between Sellers, Harvey and the Boultings, I'm All Right Jack. ==Plot== A naive but caring prison chaplain, John Smallwood (Sellers), is accidentally assigned as vicar to the small and prosperous English country town of Orbiston Parva, in place of an upper-class cleric (Carmichael) with the same name, who is favoured by the Despard family, who practically run the town and operate a large factory there. Smallwood's belief in charity and forgiveness sets him at odds with the locals, whose assertions that they are good, Christian people are belied in Smallwood's eyes by their behaviour and ideas. He creates social ructions by appointing a black dustman (Peters) as his churchwarden, taking in a gypsy family, and persuading local landowner Lady Despard (Jeans) to provide food for the church to distribute free to the people of the town. His scheme spirals out of control and very soon the local traders are up in arms as they have lost all their customers. He tries to explain this to the residents but is besieged in the church hall and only just rescued by the police. As a face-saving act, the Bishop appoints the 'original' Smallwood to the parish and assigns the 'troublemaker' to the Scottish island of 'Ultima Thule'. He is made 'Bishop of Outer Space' to the British space operations based there. But when the intended pilot of the first rocket gets cold feet, Smallwood takes his place. He is last heard broadcasting a sermon over the rocket's radio. ==Main cast== * Peter Sellers as the Reverend John Edward Smallwood * Cecil Parker as Archdeacon Aspinall * Isabel Jeans as Lady Lucy Despard * Ian Carmichael as the Other Smallwood * Bernard Miles as Simpson * Brock Peters as Matthew Robinson * Eric Sykes as Harry Smith * Irene Handl as Rene Smith * Miriam Karlin as Winnie Smith * Josephine Woodford as Doris Smith * Joan Miller as Mrs. Smith-Gould * Miles Malleson as Rockeby * Eric Barker as Bank Manager * William Hartnell as Major Fowler, town councillor * Roy Kinnear as Fred Smith * Joan Hickson as Housewife * Kenneth Griffith as Reverend Owen Thomas * Mark Eden as Sir Geoffrey Despard * John Comer as Butcher * Basil Dignam as Prison Governor * Franklin Engelmann as TV Commentator * Colin Gordon as Prime Minister * Geoffrey Hibbert as Council Official * Joan Heal as Disgruntled Housewife * Ludovic Kennedy as Himself * Margery Lawrence as Quarrelling Housewife * Harry Locke as Shop Steward * Henry Longhurst as Deaf Man * Malcolm Muggeridge as Cleric * Derek Nimmo as Director-Generals Assistant * Conrad Phillips as P.R.O. * Nicholas Phipps as Director-General * Cardew Robinson as Tramp * Gerald Sim as Store Manager * Olive Sloane as Housewife * Marianne Stone as Miss Palmer * Elsie Wagstaff Lady on Parish Council * Thorley Walters as Tranquilax Executive * Ian Wilson as Salvation Army Major * George Woodbridge as Bishop * Drewe Henley as Doris's Boy Friend (uncredited) * Ed Devereaux as Communication Officer (uncredited) The cast includes several noteworthy uncredited performers: A Hard Day's Night actor John Junkin, Rodney Bewes, who has a couple of lines as a milkman, and future Small Faces and Humble Pie singer Steve Marriott.BBC - h2g2 - The Small Faces - the Band. Steve Marriott appeared in Heavens Above! Sellers's performance is generally held to be outstanding, in a meatier, more dramatic role, similar to his work in I'm All Right Jack, released in 1959. ==Reception== The film premiered in London on 23 May 1963 at the Columbia Cinema in Shaftesbury Avenue (today known as Curzon SohoCinema Treasures: Curzon Soho Linked 2014-03-15), and although it disappointed the critic for The Times, who found it lacking the mild bite and satire of the Boulting-Sellers film I'm All Right Jack, it became one of the 12 most popular films in Britain in 1963.The Times, 3 January 1964, page 4: Most Popular Films Of 1963 - found in The Times Digital Archive 2012-07-11 ==Analysis== An article in Garden History likened the character of the Reverend John Smallwood to that of an 18th-century picturesque guru William Gilpin: \\"The first act of the new reverend is to invite a group of colourful travellers to reside in the vicarage; the second is to convince an old lady to open her house and grounds to all sorts of poor vagabonds, scruffs and vagrants, characters who bring picturesque values to the noble scene. Eventually, a picturesque economic system based on free donation causes havoc in the village and the nation - the reverend is made a bishop and sent into space, in Britain's first spaceship. The film revives a character that one can safely imagine as a modern version of Doctor Syntax - cordial, dedicated, stubborn, fearless, not reacting against, but slightly diverging from, the established values of his culture.\\"The Revd William Gilpin and the Picturesque; Or, Who's Afraid of Doctor Syntax? Author(s): Francesca Orestano Source: Garden History, Vol.31, No.2 (Winter, 2003), pp. 163‚Äì179 Like other Boulting films, Heavens Above! satirises contemporary materialistic attitudes and cautiously espouses a socialist ethos, while also showing the possible deleterious side-effects of such ideas, and the all-too-human tendency to take advantage of naive generosity. ==References* * Category:1963 films Category:1963 comedy films Category:British films Category:British comedy films Category:British satirical films Category:British black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by John Boulting Category:Films directed by Roy Boulting Category:Films scored by Richard Rodney Bennett Category:Films about Christianity Category:Religion in the United Kingdom ","title":"Heavens Above!"},{"id":"2219633","text":"This is a list of people associated with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, including Presidents, Institute leaders, Trustees, Alumni, Professors and Researchers.

SofaWare's co-founder Adi Ruppin said that his company wanted to make the technology simple to use and affordable, and to lift the burden of security management from end users while adding some features.Interview with Adi Ruppin, Founder and Managing Director of SofaWare, by Berislav Kucan ‚Äî Tuesday, 21 January 2003.

In 2004 Etay Bogner, co-founder of SofaWare, sought court approval to file a shareholder derivative suit, claiming Check Point was not transferring funds to SofaWare as required for its use of SofaWare's products and technology. His derivative suit was ultimately successful, and Check Point was ordered to pay SofaWare 13 million shekels for breach of contract. In 2006 the Tel Aviv District Court Judge ruled that Bogner SofaWare could sue Check Point by proxy for $5.1 million in alleged damage to SofaWare. Bogner claimed that Check Point, which owned 60% of Sofaware, had behaved belligerently, and withheld monies due for use of SofaWare technology and products Check Point appealed the ruling, but lost.Israeli Supreme Court, ◊¢◊ê 2850/08 CHECK POINT SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGIES LTD ◊†' ◊ê◊ô◊™◊ô ◊ë◊ï◊í◊†◊® (◊¢◊ú◊ô◊ï◊ü, ◊ê' ◊®◊ï◊ë◊ô◊†◊©◊ò◊ô◊ô◊ü, ◊ó' ◊û◊ú◊¶◊®, ◊†' ◊î◊†◊ì◊ú) In 2009 the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that a group of founders of SofaWare, which includes Bogner, had veto power over any decision of SofaWare. The court ruled that the three founders could exercise their veto power only as a group and by majority rule. In 2011 Check Point settled all litigation relating to SofaWare. As part of the settlement it acquired the SofaWare shares held by Bogner and Ruppin, and began a process of acquiring the remaining shares, resulting in SofaWare becoming a wholly owned subsidiary.Check Point 20-F SEC filing. 2011 ==See also== * Check Point GO * Economy of Israel * Silicon Wadi * ZoneAlarm ==References * Corporate website Category:Computer security companies Category:Computer security software companies Category:Software companies established in 1993 Category:Israeli brands Category:Networking hardware companies Category:Software companies of Israel Category:Deep packet inspection Category:Server appliance Category:Companies based in San Carlos, California Category:Software companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Tel Aviv Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ Category:1993 establishments in Israel Category:1996 initial public offerings ","title":"Check Point"},{"id":"2219659","text":"The Rape of the Sabine Women by Peter Paul Rubens. The Rape of the Sabine Women (), also known as the Abduction of the Sabine Women or the Kidnapping of the Sabine Women, was an incident in Roman mythology in which the men of Rome committed a mass abduction of young women from the other cities in the region. It has been a frequent subject of artists and sculptors, particularly during the Renaissance and post-Renaissance eras. The word \\"rape\\" is the conventional translation of the Latin word used in the ancient accounts of the incident. Modern scholars tend to interpret the word as \\"abduction\\" or \\"kidnapping\\" as opposed to a sexual assault. Controversy remains, however, as to how the acts committed against the women should be judged. ==Story== Rape of the Sabine Women by Pietro da Cortona, 1627‚Äì1629 According to Roman historian Livy, the abduction of Sabine women took place in the early history of Rome shortly after its founding in the mid-8th century BC and was perpetrated by Romulus and his predominantly male followers; it is said that after the foundation of the city, the population consisted solely of male bandits, Latins, and other Italic peoples. With Rome growing at such a steady rate in comparison to its neighbors, Romulus became concerned with maintaining the city's strength. His main concern was that with few women inhabitants there would be no chance of sustaining the city's population, without which Rome might not last longer than a generation. On the advice of the Senate, the Romans then set out into the surrounding regions in search of wives to establish families with. The Romans negotiated unsuccessfully with all the peoples that they appealed to, including the Sabines, who populated the neighboring areas. The Sabines feared the emergence of a rival society and refused to allow their women to marry the Romans. Consequently, the Romans devised a plan to abduct the Sabine women during the festival of Neptune Equester. They planned and announced a festival of games to attract people from all the nearby towns. According to Livy, many people from Rome's neighboring towns‚Äîincluding Caeninenses, Crustumini, and Antemnates‚Äîattended the festival along with the Sabines, eager to see the newly established city for themselves. At the festival, Romulus gave a signal by \\"rising and folding his cloak and then throwing it round him again,\\" at which the Romans grabbed the Sabine women and fought off the Sabine men. In total, thirty Sabine women were abducted by the Romans at the festival. All of the women abducted at the festival were said to have been virgins except for one married woman, Hersilia, who became Romulus' wife and would later be the one to intervene and stop the ensuing war between the Romans and the Sabines. The indignant abductees were soon implored by Romulus to accept the Roman men as their new husbands.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, Book 1 Ch. 9, p. 15. ==War with Sabines and other tribes== Jacques Stella, The Rape of the Sabines, mid-17th century, Princeton University Art MuseumThe Kidnapping of the Sabine Women by left Outraged at what had happened, the king of the Caeninenses entered upon Roman territory with his army. Romulus and the Romans met the Caeninenses in battle, killed their king, and routed their army. Romulus later attacked Caenina and took it upon the first assault. Returning to Rome, he dedicated a temple to Jupiter Feretrius (according to Livy, the first temple dedicated in Rome) and offered the spoils of the enemy king as spolia opima. According to the Fasti Triumphales, Romulus celebrated a triumph over the Caeninenses on 1 March 752 BC.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.10 At the same time, the army of the Antemnates invaded Roman territory. The Romans retaliated, and the Antemnates were defeated in battle and their town captured. According to the Fasti Triumphales, Romulus celebrated a second triumph in 752 BC over the Antemnates. The Crustumini also started a war, but they too were defeated and their town was captured. Roman colonists were subsequently sent to Antemnae and Crustumerium by Romulus, and many citizens of those towns also migrated to Rome (particularly the families of the captured women). The Sabines themselves finally declared war, led into battle by their king, Titus Tatius. Tatius almost succeeded in capturing Rome, thanks to the treason of Tarpeia, daughter of Spurius Tarpeius, Roman governor of the citadel on the Capitoline Hill. She opened the city gates for the Sabines in return for \\"what they bore on their arms\\", thinking she would receive their golden bracelets. Instead, the Sabines crushed her to death with their shields, and her body was buried on or thrown from a rock known ever since by her name, the Tarpeian Rock. The Romans attacked the Sabines, who now held the citadel. The Roman advance was led by Hostus Hostilius, the Sabine defence by Mettus Curtius. Hostus fell in battle, and the Roman line gave way. The Romans retreated to the gate of the Palatium. Romulus rallied his men, promising to build a temple to Jupiter Stator on the site. He then led them back into battle. Mettus Curtius was unhorsed and fled on foot, and the Romans appeared to be winning. The Rape of the Sabine Women by Johann Heinrich Sch√∂nfeld At this point in the story, however, the Sabine women intervened: The battle came to an end, and the Sabines agreed to unite in one nation with the Romans. Titus Tatius jointly ruled with Romulus until Tatius's death five years later. The new Sabine residents of Rome settled on the Capitoline Hill, which they had captured in the battle.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1:33 == Historical analysis == The motivation behind the abduction of the Sabine women is contested among ancient sources. Livy writes that Rome's motivation for abducting the Sabine women was solely to increase the city's population and claims that no direct sexual assault took place during the abduction. Livy says that Romulus offered the Sabine women free choice as well as civic and property rights. According to Livy, Romulus spoke to each of them in person, declaring \\"that it was all owing to the pride of their parents in denying right of intermarriage to their neighbours. They would live in honourable wedlock, and share all their property and civil rights, and‚Äîdearest of all to human nature‚Äîwould be the mothers of freemen.\\" Scholars like Dionysius of Halicarnassus argue that it was an attempt to secure an alliance with the Sabines through the women's newly founded relationships with Roman men. Livy's account is reinforced in some ways through the works of Cicero. In Cicero's work De re publica, he reiterates Livy's view that the plan to abduct the Sabine women at the festival was done in order \\"to strengthen the new state\\" and \\"safeguard the resources of his kingdom and people.\\" Unlike Livy, Cicero, and Dionysius, Ovid sees the abduction of the Sabine as an avenue for the men of Rome to fulfill their sexual desires rather than an attempt at taking wives to produce children for the city. While he does make note of the issue surrounding Rome's lack of women, he does not make it out to be a factor in the planning of the abduction. ==Artistic representations== Many treatments of the legend combined a suitably inspiring example of the hardiness and courage of ancient Romans with the opportunity to depict multiple figures, including heroically semi-nude figures in intensely passionate struggle. The subject was popular during the Renaissance as symbolising the importance of marriage for the continuity of families and cultures. It was also an example of a battle subject in which the artist could demonstrate his skill in depicting female as well as male figures in extreme poses, with the added advantage of a sexual theme. It was depicted regularly on 15th-century Italian cassoni and later in larger paintings. A comparable opportunity from the New Testament was afforded by the theme of the Massacre of the Innocents. ===Giambologna=== The Rape of the Sabine Women by Giambologna at the Loggia dei Lanzi The 16th-century Italo-Flemish sculptor Giambologna sculpted a representation of this theme with three figures (a man lifting a woman into the air while a second man crouches), carved from a single block of marble. This sculpture is considered Giambologna's masterpiece.Liam E. Semler, The English Mannerist Poets and the Visual Arts 1998, , page 34. Originally intended as nothing more than a demonstration of the artist's ability to create a complex sculptural group, its subject matter, the legendary rape of the Sabines, had to be invented after Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, decreed that it be put on public display in the Loggia dei Lanzi in Piazza della Signoria, Florence. The proposed site for the sculpture, opposite Benvenuto Cellini's statue of Perseus, prompted suggestions that the group should illustrate a theme related to the former work, such as the rape of Andromeda by Phineus. The respective rapes of Proserpina and Helen were also mooted as possible themes. It was eventually decided that the sculpture was to be identified as one of the Sabine virgins. The work is signed OPVS IOANNIS BOLONII FLANDRI MDLXXXII (\\"The work of Johannes of Boulogne of Flanders, 1582\\"). An early preparatory bronze featuring only two figures is in the Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte in Naples. Giambologna then revised the scheme, this time with a third figure, in two wax models now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. The artist's full-scale gesso for the finished sculpture, executed in 1582, is on display at the Galleria dell'Accademia in Florence. The woman and the kneeling man reference figures from the ancient sculpture Laoco√∂n and His Sons. Bronze reductions of the sculpture, produced in Giambologna's own studio and imitated by others, were a staple of connoisseurs' collections into the 19th century. The Abduction of the Sabine Women, by Nicolas Poussin, (1634‚Äì1635) (Metropolitan Museum of Art) The Rape of the Sabine Women, by Nicolas Poussin, Rome, 1637‚Äì38 (Louvre Museum) ===Nicolas Poussin=== Nicolas Poussin produced two major versions of this subject. His initial version was entitled The Abduction of the Sabine Women and was most likely completed around 1633‚Äì1634. The painting depicts Romulus giving the signal to the Romans for the abduction. According to the Met, the subject matter of Poussin's work allowed him to highlight his understanding of pose and gesture as well as his knowledge of Roman architecture. This version of the painting currently resides at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Poussin's second version, entitled The Rape of the Sabine Women, is essentially a recreation of his original work and was likely completed around 1637‚Äì1638. The architectural setting of this work is more developed than in the original. This painting currently resides in the Louvre Museum in Paris. According to the Louvre, painting multiple version of one subject was not uncommon throughout Poussin's career. ===Peter Paul Rubens=== Peter Paul Rubens painted his version of The Rape of the Sabine Women around 1635‚Äì40. It now resides in the National Gallery, London. The painting depicts the moment Romulus gave the signal for the Romans to abduct the Sabine women. Rubens emphasizes the violence of the abduction and sexualizes it by depicting women with exposed breasts and a soldier lifting up a woman's skirt. === Johann Heinrich Sch√∂nfeld === Johann Heinrich Sch√∂nfeld painted a version of this subject entitled The Rape of the Sabine Women in the late 1630s. His work now resides at the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. === Jacques Stella === Jacques Stella painted a version of the Rape of the Sabine Women entitled The Rape of the Sabines in the mid-17th century. Stella's depiction of the scene is said to have so closely resembled Nicholas Poussin's works that following his death his version was mistaken for a Poussin. This work now resides at Princeton University's Art Museum. ===Jacques-Louis David=== 1799). Jacques-Louis David painted the other end of the story, when the women intervene to reconcile the warring parties. The Sabine Women Enforcing Peace by Running Between the Combatants (also known as The Intervention of the Sabine Women) was completed in 1799. It is in the Louvre Museum. David had begun work on it in 1796, when France was at war with other European nations, after a period of civil conflict culminating in the Reign of Terror and the Thermidorian Reaction, during which David himself had been imprisoned as a supporter of Robespierre. After David's estranged wife visited him in jail, he conceived the idea of telling the story to honor his wife, with the theme being love prevailing over conflict. The painting was also seen as a plea for the French people to reconcile their differences after the bloodshed of the French Revolution. The painting depicts Romulus's wife Hersilia ‚Äî the daughter of Titus Tatius, leader of the Sabines ‚Äî rushing between her husband and her father and placing her babies between them. A vigorous Romulus prepares to strike a half-retreating Tatius with his spear, but hesitates. Other soldiers are already sheathing their swords. The rocky outcrop in the background is the Tarpeian Rock. ===John Leech=== John Leech's satirical version of The Rape of the Sabine Women The English 19th-century satirical painter John Leech included in his Comic History of Rome a depiction of the Rape of the Sabine Women, where the women are portrayed, with a deliberate anachronism, in Victorian costume and being carried off from the \\"Corona et Ancora\\" (\\"Crown and Anchor\\", a common English pub sign in seafaring towns). === Edgar Degas === Edgar Degas painted The Rape of the Sabines (after Poussin), c. 1861‚Äì1862. \\"The masters must be copied over and over again\\", Degas said, \\"and it is only after proving yourself a good copyist that you should reasonably be permitted to draw a radish from nature.\\" Degas first received permission to copy paintings at the Louvre in 1853 when he was eighteen. He was most interested in the great works of the Italian Renaissance and of his own classical French heritage, hence this detailed copy of Poussin's painting. The Invasion by Charles Christian Nahl (1871) ===Charles Christian Nahl=== Charles Christian Nahl painted the subject in a trio of works entitled The Abduction, The Captivity, and The Invasion. ===Pablo Picasso=== Pablo Picasso visited this theme in his several versions of the Rape of the Sabine Women (1962‚Äì63), one of which is in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. These are based on David's version. These conflate the beginning and end of the story, depicting the brutish Romulus and Tatius ignoring and trampling on the exposed figure of Hersilia and her child.La tomba del principe sabino ‚Äî Glossario . ==Literature and performing artsAncient works=== The episode of the Rape of the Sabine Women is recounted by Cicero,Cicero, De re publica II.7‚Äì8. Livy,Livy, Ab urbe condita I.9‚Äì13. Dionysius of Halicarnassus,Dionysius of Halicarnassus Roman Antiquities II.30. and Plutarch.Plutarch, Parallel Lives, \\"Life of Romulus\\" IX. The poetry of Ovid also contains several allusions to this episode.Ovid, Fasti III (Kalends of March); Fasti II (February 15); Ars Amatoria I.4. ===Modern works=== The midrash Sefer haYashar (first attested in 1624) portrays the story as part of a war between the Sabines, descended from Tubal, and the Roman Kittim (Jasher 17:1‚Äì15). A more detailed version of this narrative is found in the earlier mediaeval rabbinic work Yosippon. The story was parodied by Lady Carlotta, the mischief-making character in Saki's short story \\"The Schartz-Metterklume Method\\".H. H. Munro (Saki), Beasts and Super- Beasts: Beasts (1914), available at Project Gutenberg and at Read book online Stephen Vincent Ben√©t wrote a short story called \\"The Sobbin' Women\\" that parodied the legend. Later adapted into the 1954 musical Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, it tells the story of seven gauche but sincere backwoodsmen, one of whom gets married, encouraging the others to seek partners. After a social where they meet girls they are attracted to, they are denied the chance to pursue their courtship by the latter's menfolk. Following the Roman example, they abduct the girls. As in the original tale, the women are at first indignant but are eventually won over. In 1962, a Spanish \\"sword and sandal\\" film based on the story was made, directed by Alberto Gout. Titled El Rapto de las Sabinas, the film was released in the USA under the titles The Rape of the Sabine Women and The Shame of the Sabine Women. Tom Stoppard's play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (1966) features a group of all-male players offering to put on a performance of The Rape of the Sabine Women, to the disgust of the title characters. The latest adaptation is a film without dialogue, The Rape of the Sabine Women, which was produced in 2005 by Eve Sussman and the Rufus Corporation. ==Cultural context== The 18th-century artist Niccol√≤ Bambini painted the subject at least twice. Scholars have cited parallels between the Rape of the Sabine Women, the √Üsir‚ÄìVanir War in Norse mythology, and the Mahabharata from Hindu mythology, providing support for a Proto-Indo-European \\"war of the functions\\".

In 1957, he received a position at the Social Security Office. He went on a career at the National Institute of Social Providence, where he became the principal inspector and regional director of Kayes, Gao, Mopti, Koulikoro, and Bamako before his 1997 retirement. Along with his administrative career, Sumano also assumed the functions of a griot. In 1994, he became head of the Association of Griots of Mali and dedicated himself to restoring the griots (who he preferred to call jeli) to a prominent role in Malian life. He began courtesy visits to foreign heads of state visiting Mali and won recognition for the Association of Griots in the protocol list of the Republic in many official ceremonies. He also began accompanying the family of Niar√©, founders of Bamako, to the mosque for the Tabaski prayer. Finally, he put in place official ceremonies for the naming of head griots in different cities, such as San and Nar√©na. Increasingly famous, Sumano acted as a consultant for UNESCO and participated in many seminars and colloquia on Malian traditions in African, European, and US universities.

Several veins are also in the area (for example, the median cubital vein, cephalic vein, and basilic vein) but these are usually considered superficial to the cubital fossa, and not part of its contents. ==Clinical aspects== A sample of blood being taken from the median cubital vein via the cubital fossa with a vacutainer for a blood test. Like other flexion surfaces of large joints (groin, popliteal fossa, armpit and essentially the anterior part of the neck), it is an area where blood vessels and nerves pass relatively superficially, and with an increased amount of lymph nodes. During blood pressure measurements, the stethoscope is placed over the brachial artery in the cubital fossa. The artery runs medial to the biceps tendon. The brachial pulse may be palpated in the cubital fossa just medial to the tendon. The area just superficial to the cubital fossa is often used for venous access (phlebotomy) in procedures such as injections and obtaining samples for blood tests. A number of superficial veins can cross this region. It may also be used for the insertion of a peripherally inserted central catheter. Historically, when (venous) blood-letting was practiced, the bicipital aponeurosis (the ceiling of the cubital fossa) was known as the \\"grace of God\\" tendon because it protected the more important contents of the fossa (i.e. the brachial artery and the median nerve).

J.J Institute Of Applied Art, Mumbai. Sir J. J. Institute of Applied Art is an Indian applied art institution based in Mumbai. It is a state government college that was created through its sister school, the Sir J. J. School of Art. The \\"Sir J. J.\\" in the name stands for Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy, a Parsi philanthropist whose name is linked to numerous historical institutions of Mumbai, such as the Sir J. J. Hospital. In 1958, Sir J. J. School of Art was divided, with the Departments of Architecture and Applied Art becoming the Sir J. J. College of Architecture and Sir J.J. Institute of Applied Art respectively. ==HistoryCommercial Art Section=== The Institute of Applied Art history first began with the founding of its sister school, the Sir J. J. School of Art. The school opened through the help of a donation by Jamsetji Jeejeebhai in 1857. During the Second World War the school was threatened with closure. At the time the school was run by the British Bombay government and its funding came directly from the government. In preparation for the looming war many committees were set up to review excess government expenditure and divert money to defense needs. The close scrutiny of one such \\"Thomas Committee\\" fell on the Sir J. J. School of Art. The committee recommended that the school be shut down, claiming that it only contributed to furthering personal talents of artists and was of no use to society in general. The director of the J. J. School of Art set out to rectify the situation. In 1935 Mr. Soloman was the dean of J.J. In 1946, J. J. School of Art started a new department, the Commercial Art Section, or CAS. The objective of this division was to impart all of the necessary training in art with an eye on students being able to exploit this training for commercial purposes. A direct contribution of this section was to aid the war preparations of the government by designing propaganda and public awareness posters. This exercise was a huge success. Therefore, the government decided not to shut down the Sir J. J. School of Art. The students trained at the CAS soon found that they were in considerable demand from the commercial industries of Mumbai (then Bombay) to design publicity material. Also, the fledgling advertising industry lapped up talent from the CAS, creating a set of people who would end up being counted among the founders of Indian advertising. The CAS became popular among applicants to the Sir J.J. School of Art, as it offered a direct means of earning a livelihood to skilled artists who had completed the course. Soon, this once-small section of the school began receiving more student applications than the main part of the institute. At this time India had gained independence. The government, which still ran the school, separated the CAS from the rest of the school and create the Sir J. J. Institute of Applied Art. Professor V.N. Adarkar was named the institutes first principal and later went on to become its first dean. ===Later history=== The Institute's first dean was V. N. Adarkar. Notable deans in recent years have been H. G. Hanmante, Prof. Kamat and M. G. Rajadhyaksha. Over the years, Sir J. J. Institute of Applied Art has been involved with several projects on social awareness that include \\"Know the Five-Year Plan \\"in the 1950s, \\"Our Himalayas\\" during the 1963 Sino-Indian War, and the \\"International Tourist Fair -- Bombay\\" in 1965. ==Present== The current course leads to successful students receiving a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in Applied Art from Mumbai University. The total duration of this course is four years, with the first year referred to as a \\"Foundation\\" year, and the later three being referred to as \\"Specialization\\" years. A student chooses his or her area of major specialization from amongst areas such as Illustration, Photography, Typography, Exhibition Display or Computer Graphics. The Sir J. J. Institute of Applied Art provides more than half of the Indian advertising industry's top art talent. There is a widely held belief among past professors of the institute, as well as art educators, that it would be best for the future health of the institution if the state government grants autonomy to the institute. This would clear the way to a much-needed revamp of the quality of teaching and infrastructure and bring modern day requirements to the school. The campus is located in south-Mumbai (opposite VT station) and houses the Sir J. J. Institute of Applied Art, the Sir J. J. School of Art, Sir J. J. College of Architecture, and the Government Institute of Printing Technology. The campus contains many trees that are more than a century old, and houses numerous heritage buildings. ===The Kipling connection=== The most renowned building on the campus is the century-and-half-old wood and stone bungalow that was Rudyard Kipling's birthplace. An ornate metal plaque at the entrance of this house is engraved with the words, \\"Rudyard Kipling, son of Lockwood Kipling, first principal of Sir J. J. School of Art, was born here on 30.12.1865.\\" Traditionally the home of the deans for both the Sir J. J. School of Art and Sir J. J. Institute of Applied Art, this identically-split-bungalow attracts numerous Kipling-enthusiasts from all over the world. For decades now, the Kipling side of the bungalow has been the official Dean's Residence of the dean of Sir J. J. Institute of Applied Art. During the tenure of the last residing dean, Prof. M. G. Rajadhyaksha, a bust of Rudyard Kipling was also unveiled at the entrance to this bungalow as homage to the legendary writer of works such as The Jungle Book and If‚Äî. ==Notable alumni== *Arun Kolatkar - Poet *Prabhakar Barwe - Painter * Nana Patekar - Indian actor and filmmaker *Vikram Gaikwad - creative head, Creative Land Asia *Rajiv Rao - creative head, O&M; (creator of Vodafone zoozoos) *Raj Thackeray - politician and social worker *Uddhav Thackeray - 19th Chief Minister of Maharashtra , Politician and social worker *Gopi Kukde - Advertising Genius & the brain behind the 'Onida's Devil'. *Akbar Padamsee *Brendan Pereira, award-winning creative director and designer *Sunil Padwal - Renowned Indian painter *Shivkar Bapuji Talpade - It said that, He is The first Indian to fly an unmanned plane in 1895. *Sameer Kulavoor - Renowned Indian Illustrator *Nishant Hatkar - Renowned Indian Sculptor ==External links== * Sir J.J.

He was married to actress Margaret Rutherford. ==Military and acting careers== Stringer Davis was born on 4 June 1899 in Birkenhead, Cheshire, England. His father George Davis was a bank clerk, his mother Ethel a housewife. Davis attended the independent Uppingham School and received military basic training there. In August 1918, he volunteered for military service and was sent to the front in the First World War as a lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment. He was discharged from military service in September 1919, about 10 months after the conclusion of the war. Davis's parents separated shortly after his return from the war. His mother lived in a spacious house in Reading, Berkshire, and Davis lived in its vicinity in a boathouse overlooking the River Thames. He began his theatrical career as a member of the Oxford Repertory Company, working as both an actor and director. In 1930, he met Margaret Rutherford, his future wife, for the first time. At the time, Rutherford was still largely unknown. She wrote in her autobiography about her first encounter with her husband-to-be: \\"I noticed his bright blue eyes, his casual elegant clothes and his polite way. I couldn't take my eyes off him....He had that special something. His name was Stringer Davis.\\" He made his on-screen debut in a BBC television live drama Charles and Mary in 1938. The 40-year-old Davis put aside his acting career to volunteer again for military service in 1939. He served as a lieutenant in the East Yorkshire Regiment and later was part of the British Expeditionary Force deployed in France. He participated in the Battle of Dunkirk and was one of the many British soldiers evacuated on 4 June, 1940. Davis remained with the army until almost the end of the Second World War, with tours of duty in North Africa and Northwest Europe. After the war, Davis resumed his acting career with the film Miranda (1948), which also featured Rutherford. Overall, Davis appeared in more than 20 films with his wife. In later years, she made it a condition of her contract that Davis would play a part in any film in which she appeared. Most notably, this clause led to Davis being cast as the mild-mannered librarian Mr Stringer in four adaptations of Agatha Christie novels featuring Rutherford as Miss Marple in the early 1960s. The gentle, timid Mr Stringer was Davis's most celebrated role, gaining good reviews. ==Personal life== Davis married Margaret Rutherford in 1945 after a 15-year courtship. She was 53 and he was 46 at the time. Reportedly, his mother was the main reason for the long engagement because she was adamantly opposed to having Margaret Rutherford for a daughter-in-law. Only after the death of Ethel Davis did the duo finally marry. Once the two married, they remained totally devoted to one another, with Davis always at hand behind the camera whenever his wife was filming.

The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications), as part of a duopoly with Inglewood-licensed Ion Plus owned-and-operated station KILM (channel 64). The two stations share offices on West Olive Avenue in Burbank and transmitter facilities atop Mount Wilson. ==History== Channel 30 first signed on the air as KHOF-TV on October 16, 1969. It originally operated as a Christian broadcast outreach of the Faith Center Church in Glendale, of which Reverend Raymond Schoch served as the pastor, with Paul Crouch (who would leave in 1972 in order to begin his own Trinity Broadcasting Network) as his assistant and general manager. KHOF was the second full-time Christian television station. WYAH in Virginia Beach was the first Christian station in 1961, but beginning in 1967, that station began a very gradual evolution to a conventional commercial independent television station (which they completed in 1973). KHOF ran a mix of Schoch's own sermons, various televangelists and teaching programs, both local and syndicated. The church already owned and operated KHOF-FM radio (now KKLA) in Los Angeles. The station began to have competition when their former GM Paul Crouch left in 1972 and acquired newly purchased KLXA Channel 40 in 1974. A year later, in 1975, Schoch stepped down for health reasons, and would pass away on September 26, 1977. Dr. Gene Scott took over the ministry in 1975 and his Christian views were evolving, as reflected in his sermons. As the decade went on, KHOF gradually shifted away from syndicated Christian shows and local Christian programs to only in-house programming from Scott. Their church broke up as well, and the original Faith Center Church eventually shut down and merged with other churches while Scott had his own congregation. By 1980, the station, along with the radio stations and other TV stations owned by Faith Center, was running only Scott's discussions and sermons full-time. By 1981, the Faith Center was renamed the University Network. In the 1980s, KHOF came under the scrutiny of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) because of its fundraising operations, as well as Scott's refusal to allow the FCC to examine his station's financial records. The FCC eventually revoked KHOF-TV's license. After losing court challenges to the FCC action, KHOF-TV shut down on May 24, 1983. The final broadcast from Scott's channel 30 consisted of a number of cymbal-banging monkey toys termed as \\"The FCC Monkey Band\\" playing their mini-cymbals as a final attack against the commission.http://www.uhftelevision.com/articles/khof.htmlhttp://www.tv- signoffs.com/clips/KHOF-signoff-1970s.htm In order to keep channel 30 from going dark until a new permanent licensee could be selected from the many applications that the FCC anticipated, they decided to allow an interim broadcaster to operate on the channel. In 1984, Angeles Broadcasting was granted an interim license and in January 1985, returned channel 30 to the air as KAGL-TV. The station continued to broadcast religious programming from Gene Scott as well. Because KAGL utilized the old KHOF transmitter, still owned by Faith Center, KAGL provided Dr. Scott four hours of evening time and some daytime hours to continue the Festival of Faith programs he televised on KHOF. In 1992, the FCC shut down KAGL in order to allow new licensee Sandino Communications (an investor group whose name is shorthand for the city of license of San Bernardino) to construct a new transmitter for a planned television station under the KZKI call letters. The current channel 30 signed on the air on January 7, 1994 as KZKI, airing a mix of religious programs, infomercials, and some movies in the four years between that time and the launch of Pax TV (later i: Independent Television, now Ion Television) on August 31, 1998. Sandino sold KZKI to Paxson Communications (the forerunner to Ion Media Networks) in 1995 for $18 million in cash and the assumption of debt. KPXN's analog signal on UHF channel 30 was the last television station to transmit from Sunset Ridge in the Mount San Antonio range. At one time, KDOC (channel 56; now broadcasting from Mount Wilson), KSCI (channel 18) and KRCA (channel 62; both now transmitting from Mount Harvard) broadcast their signals from Sunset Ridge as well. Until the expansion of Ion Television's schedule past 1 a.m. in early 2011, KPXN aired one hour of Bible teaching programs nightly at 1 a.m. from the Los Angeles University Cathedral, which is taught by Dr. Scott's widow, Melissa Scott. The program was part of Ion's national schedule via a time brokerage agreement. ==Digital televisionDigital channels=== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {  - ! Channel ! Video ! Aspect !

KPXN branded the 7:00 p.m. airing of channel 4's 6:00 newscast (which aired on a one-hour tape delay) as The Channel 4 News at 6 p.m. on PAX30, and the 11:30 p.m. airing of that station's late newscast (which aired on a half-hour delay) as The Channel 4 News at 11:30 on PAX30.

While at Motherwell, McMillan suffered a broken leg, which would lead to several injury problems in his later career. He bounced back from that unfortunate incident to develop into an all-around defender, able to move forward into attacking positions when needed. McMillan was sold to Wigan Athletic in March 2001 for ¬£550,000 on the same day as teammate Lee McCulloch. He was an instant hit at Wigan, but a series of injuries ruined his career. He suffered a knee injury setback in 2004, and was out of the game for almost a year, not making an appearance until late in the 2004‚Äì05 season. He was only able to make 5 appearances as Wigan were promoted, and he lost his place to the young Leighton Baines. McMillan only made two league appearances for Wigan in their debut Premiership season, against Charlton and Fulham. He picked up a bad knee injury in the League Cup semi- final against Arsenal, which ruled him out for the rest of the season. A year after the knee injury, McMillan announced his retirement on 27 February 2007. ==References * Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Edinburgh Category:Scottish footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Troon F.C. players Category:Motherwell F.C. players Category:Wigan Athletic F.C. players Category:Scottish Premier League players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:English Football League players Category:Premier League players Category:Scotland under-21 international footballers ","title":"Steve McMillan"},{"id":"2219703","text":"The Tuition Assistance Program is a financial aid program for students who are New York State residents and who are attending a post-secondary educational institution in New York. It is a program of the Higher Education Services Corporation which is a New York State Agency. ==Qualifications== The Tuition Assistance Program, better known as TAP, is an aid program that helps New York State residents going to college with their tuition. To become eligible for TAP, students must be United States citizens and New York State residents. With the TAP award, a student can earn from $500 to $5,000. Because TAP is a grant, the aid does not need to be repaid. There are several determining factors that influence how much aid students receive, such as family income and tax status (independent or dependent). Dependent students qualify for TAP if their family net tax income is below $80,000, and independent students who are married but have no parental income qualify if their income is below $40,000. Single independent students qualify for TAP if they have no parental income and their personal income is below $10,000. Other qualifications include number of college credits and grade point average for individuals who are already in school.\\"Office of Postsecondary Access, Support & Success.\\" Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP):KIAP:NYSED. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 May 2016. The Tuition Assistance Program is a part of a program called The Higher Education Services Corporation. The Higher Education Services program is a financial aid agency for college students. Tuition assistance is available for SUNY/CUNY colleges and can be used for tuition and fees for coursework related to students' majors. To apply for TAP, students can visit the financial aid website at FAFSA.gov. To apply students will first need the school name and code. If students are working part-time individuals can receive up to $1500, and if students are working full-time they can receive up to $3,000. If students are in school one must be a full-time student with at least a 2.0 average and taking 12 credits or more. Students will need to have a high school diploma and have graduated high school in the United States to be eligible for TAP. Also, according to the Higher Education Services Corporation, students must be charged at least $200 tuition per year.\\"Office of Postsecondary Access, Support & Success.\\" Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP):KIAP:NYSED. N.p., n.d. Web. 08 May 2016. Undergraduate students who enroll in bachelors programs can receive four years of TAP if they are studying full-time. If students do not fulfill the requirements for the tuition assistance then they can lose their funding and can be forced to repay the aid for that course. If a student is unable to keep up with credits or grades (for example, if a student's grade point average is below a C- with fewer than 12 credits) then the student can lose the assistance. Because TAP is a state program, some states have appeal programs, allowing participants to explain why they could not meet the requirements. Some states do not have the appeal process. If a student drops a class that TAP is paying for, the student may need to pay the full amount for that course. TAP is an award and it will appear on a student‚Äôs financial aid award letter from the school the student is attending or planning to attend and from the New York State higher service corporation (NYSHESC). The letter states how much aid students will be getting. Undergraduate students are limited to only 8 semesters to receive TAP.\\"Office of Postsecondary Access, Support & Success.\\" Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP):KIAP:NYSED. N.p., n.d.

To receive TAP students have to be studying a specific major and in an approved degree program. Each year the deadline to complete a TAP form is June 30. After filling out a FAFSA application, the website will provide a link to the TAP homepage to fill the application. Students will acquire a user ID and a pin number to apply and make changes.\\"Guideline & Requirements.\\" HEOPorg. N.p., n.d.

Each state has its own grant/scholarship program for college students. The qualifications in each program are the similar to TAP. Some examples of different state grant programs are California's Cal grant program, Cal Dream Act, and Georgia's HOPE grant program. Grants are also provided by the US Military. The military tuition assistance program is for students who are of a military family. The military tuition program helps to pay almost the full amount of a student‚Äôs tuition costs.

He represented the England under-20 team in February 2003. A pacey, left-footed forward, he began his career at Reading, where he made his first team debut in April 2000. He had loan spells at Maidenhead United, Swansea City, Cheltenham Town, and Wycombe Wanderers, before he joined Wycombe Wanderers on a permanent transfer in March 2004. He averaged a goal every two games for Wycombe, and was sold on to Nottingham Forest for a ¬£675,000 fee in January 2006. He spent five and a half seasons with Forest, and helped the club to win promotion out of League One in 2007‚Äì08. He moved on to Derby County in June 2011, and was loaned out to Millwall in January 2013. He signed with Blackpool in September 2013, and was loaned out to Fleetwood Town and Notts County after failing to win a first team place at Blackpool. He joined Doncaster Rovers in July 2014, and spent two seasons with the club before moving to Kilmarnock in 2016 for a year. ==Club careerReading=== Tyson began his career at Reading as part of the youth academy, and made his first team debut on 29 April 2000, coming on as an 80th-minute substitute for Darius Henderson in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Bury at Gigg Lane. In August 2001, he joined Swansea City of the Third Division on an initial one-month loan. On 29 September, he was sent off for a foul on goalkeeper Stuart Brock two minutes after coming on as a substitute in a 2‚Äì0 win over Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough, though manager Colin Addison said that he intended to appeal the decision as Tyson was \\"only a fraction from taking the ball\\". Tyson scored his first goal in the Football League on 23 October, helping the \\"Swans\\" to a 2‚Äì0 win over Darlington at Vetch Field. He returned to the Third Division towards the end of the 2001‚Äì02 season, joining Cheltenham Town on loan in March 2002. Manager Steve Cotterill signed him to help the club push for the play-offs, and Tyson scored one goal from one start and seven substitute appearances in the league, but did not feature in the play-offs as the \\"Robins\\" went on to secure promotion with a 3‚Äì1 victory over Rushden & Diamonds in the play-off final. Reading were promoted into the First Division in 2002, and Tyson managed to earn himself a place in the \\"Royals\\" first team in the 2002‚Äì03 season, scoring his first goal for the club in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Derby County on 28 December. Reading qualified for the play-offs at the end of the campaign, though Tyson was sent off in the play-off semi-final first leg defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers after fouling Paul Butler and then using abusive language. ===Wycombe Wanderers=== In December 2003, Tyson joined Second Division side Wycombe Wanderers on a short- term loan, although had to return to Reading early the next month for treatment on a knee injury. After impressing manager Tony Adams, Tyson was signed for an undisclosed transfer fee in March 2004 and agreed a two-year contract. He finished as the club's top-scorer during the 2004‚Äì05 season with 22 goals in 42 league appearances, and also won the club's Player of the Year award. During the close season, Tyson was the subject of three bids from Sheffield Wednesday, all of which were turned down by Wycombe. He began the 2005‚Äì06 season with 13 goals in 19 games, making him the top-scorer in the English leagues at the end of September. He was named as the League Two Player of the Month for August, having scored six times in six games. Sheffield Wednesday had a ¬£700,000 bid accepted in October, but Tyson rejected the move. Tyson stated that he was \\"flattered\\" and said \\"I'm not worth that. How many houses can you buy for ¬£750,000?\\" He was also linked with moves to Wolverhampton Wanderers and Hull City. His goal glut was quickly followed by a run of six games without a goal, which led manager John Gorman to claim that \\"his attitude has been fantastic and he'll bounce straight back\\". ===Nottingham Forest=== In November 2005, Tyson joined League One side Nottingham Forest on loan until January, at which point he signed a permanent deal with the club for a fee of ¬£675,000. He ended the 2005‚Äì06 campaign with ten goals in 28 appearances. He was injured just minutes into Forest's opening game of the 2006‚Äì07 season against Bradford City on 5 August, which kept him out of action for three months. On 9 December, he scored an eight-minute first half hat-trick in a 4‚Äì1 win over Crewe Alexandra at Gresty Road. He ended the season with nine goals in 30 games. He scored 12 goals in 39 league and cup competitions in the 2007‚Äì08 season, helping Forest to secure runners-up spot in League One and thereby win promotion to the Championship. In May 2008, he was the subject of a ¬£750,000 bid from Bristol City, which was rejected. In January 2009, Tyson signed a new contract to keep him at the City Ground until the summer of 2011. On 22 January, he scored a volleyed goal to help Forest to beat Premier League side Manchester City 3‚Äì0 in the Third Round of the FA Cup. On 29 August 2009, Tyson waved a Nottingham Forest flag in front of the Derby fans after the final whistle of a 3‚Äì2 East Midlands derby victory. He was defended by manager Billy Davies but received a fine of ¬£5,000 and a two-game suspended ban for the incident. He scored just four goals in 75 appearances in the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010‚Äì11 seasons, though was often only entering the game as a substitute. He left the club in May 2011 after rejecting the offer of a new contract. ===Derby County=== In June 2011, Tyson signed a three-year contract with Derby County. He made his \\"Rams\\" debut in a 2‚Äì1 win over former club Nottingham Forest on 17 September. However, he made only two brief appearances in the first half of the 2011‚Äì12 season after struggling with groin problems. He scored his first goal for the club in the opening game of the 2012‚Äì13 season against Scunthorpe United in the League Cup on 14 August, a match which Derby drew 5‚Äì5 and lost 6‚Äì7 on penalties. He scored his first league goal four days later, in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Sheffield Wednesday. After the match it was reported that fellow Championship side Huddersfield Town were interested in signing Tyson on loan. Tyson fell down the first team pecking order at Derby behind Conor Sammon, Chris Martin, Johnny Russell, and Mason Bennett. On 16 January 2013, Tyson joined Millwall on loan until the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season. Manager Kenny Jackett said that \\"he has experience of the division [Championship], which at times we've lacked, and he brings pace to our front line\\". He made his \\"lions\\" debut as a half-time substitute in a 2‚Äì0 home defeat against Burnley on 19 January; during this game he picked up ligament damage, with an initial prognosis before a scan ruling him out for a month. He failed to score and only managed four appearances as he struggled with injuries during his time at The Den. He was transfer listed by Derby in May 2013. He stated that he was unhappy at finding this fact out through the media and said that manager Nigel Clough did not tell him that he was placed on the transfer list. ===Blackpool=== In September 2013, Tyson joined Championship club Blackpool on a free transfer, signing a one-year contract with an option of a second. On 21 November 2013, Nathan joined League Two side Fleetwood Town on loan until 1 January 2014. On 3 March 2014, he joined League One side Notts County on an initial one-month loan, which was later extended until the end of the season. He failed to score in either of his loan spells or for his parent club in a total of 25 appearances in the 2013‚Äì14 season. ===Doncaster Rovers=== In July 2014, Tyson signed a one-year contract with League One club Doncaster Rovers after impressing on a three-week trial. He triggered a one- year contract extension in April 2015, and said he \\"rediscovered his love for football\\" playing under Paul Dickov. He scored a hat-trick on the last day of the 2014‚Äì15 season, in a 5‚Äì2 win over Scunthorpe United at the Keepmoat Stadium on 3 May. This took him to a final tally of 14 goals in 44 games in all competitions to finish the season as the club's top-scorer, and he was also voted the club's Player of the Year. He then scored seven goals in 36 games in the 2015‚Äì16 season as Rovers were relegated into League Two. He lost his first team place to new-signing Gary McSheffrey in March 2016, and manager Darren Ferguson agreed to activate a release in Tyson's contract in June 2016 despite the striker only signing a new one-year contract three months earlier. He joined Port Vale on trial in July 2016, and manager Bruno Ribeiro told the media that he would sign the player if the club's finances allowed it. ===Kilmarnock=== Tyson signed for Kilmarnock on 12 September 2016, having agreed a contract to the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season. Kilmarnock announced in their match programme on 5 April 2017 that Tyson had been released from his contract. ===Wycombe Wanderers (second spell)=== On 3 July 2017, Wycombe Wanderers announced that Tyson had returned to the club on trial. After playing in some of Wycombe's pre-season friendlies, it was announced on 25 July 2017 that Tyson had signed a one-year deal to return to Wycombe. On 23 April 2018, Tyson signed a one-year extension keeping him at Wycombe Wanderers until the summer of 2019. He was released by Wycombe at the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season. ==International career== On 6 February 2003, Tyson scored both goals for England under-20's in a 2‚Äì1 win over Germany. ==Style of play== Speaking in 2002, Cheltenham Town manager Steve Cotterill stated that \\"he is very quick and his main asset is his pace\\". Writing for The Guardian in October 2005, David Pleat said that \\"as a speedy, left-footed goalscorer Tyson is a rarity in the modern game\\" who made \\"well-timed runs\\", particularly for through balls, and had determination to chase lost causes. ==Personal life== Tyson was a cousin to Mark Philo, who also played professional football for Wycombe Wanderers. In a 2005 interview, Tyson stated that he had a superstition that led to him dressing on his left side first, liked the music of Usher, and had an interest in cars. ==Career statistics== {  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !rowspan=\\"2\\"Division !colspan=\\"2\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"6\\"Reading1999‚Äì2000Second Division1000000010 - 2000‚Äì01Second Division0000000000 - 2001‚Äì02Second Division1010101040 - 2002‚Äì03First Division231200010261 - 2003‚Äì04First Division8000100090 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !33!!1!!3!!0!!2!!0!!2!!0!!38!!1 - Maidenhead United (loan)2000‚Äì01Isthmian League Premier Division8300000083 - Swansea City (loan)2001‚Äì02Third Division111000000111 - Cheltenham Town (loan)2001‚Äì02Third Division8100000081 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Wycombe Wanderers2003‚Äì04Second Division219000000219 - 2004‚Äì05League Two42222010204722 - 2005‚Äì06League Two15111022101913 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !78!!42!!3!!0!!3!!2!!3!!0!!87!!44 - rowspan=\\"7\\"Nottingham Forest2005‚Äì06League One28100000002810 - 2006‚Äì07League One247520010309 - 2007‚Äì08League One3493211103912 - 2008‚Äì09Championship355321000397 - 2009‚Äì10Championship332203020402 - 2010‚Äì11Championship302201020352 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !184!!35!!15!!6!!6!!1!!6!!0!!211!!42 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Derby County2011‚Äì12Championship230100000240 - 2012‚Äì13Championship164001100175 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !39!!4!!1!!0!!1!!1!!0!!0!!41!!5 - Millwall (loan)2012‚Äì13Championship4000000040 - Blackpool2013‚Äì14Championship103000000103 - Fleetwood Town (loan)2013‚Äì14League Two4000001050 - Notts County (loan)2013‚Äì14League One100000000100 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Doncaster Rovers2014‚Äì15League One39122021114414 - 2015‚Äì16League One326311000367 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !71!!18!!5!!1!!3!!1!!1!!1!!80!!21 - Kilmarnock 2016‚Äì17 Scottish Premiership 170100000180 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Wycombe Wanderers 2017‚Äì18 League Two 338101000358 - 2018‚Äì19 League One 191000000191 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !52!!9!!1!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!54!!9 - Notts County 2019‚Äì20 National League 131300000161 - Chesterfield (loan) 2019‚Äì20 National League 6300000063 - Chesterfield 2020‚Äì21 National League 0000000000 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !510!!113!!29!!7!!16!!5!!13!!1!!568!!126 } ==HonoursClub=== ;Nottingham Forest *Football League One runner-up: 2007‚Äì08 ===Individual=== *Football League Two Player of the Month: August 2005 *Doncaster Rovers Player of the Year: 2014‚Äì15 ==References== Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Reading, Berkshire Category:Black English sportspeople Category:English footballers Category:England youth international footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Association football wingers Category:Reading F.C. players Category:Maidenhead United F.C. players Category:Swansea City A.F.C. players Category:Cheltenham Town F.C. players Category:Wycombe Wanderers F.C. players Category:Nottingham Forest F.C. players Category:Derby County F.C. players Category:Millwall F.C. players Category:Blackpool F.C. players Category:Fleetwood Town F.C. players Category:Notts County F.C. players Category:Doncaster Rovers F.C. players Category:Kilmarnock F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Isthmian League players Category:Scottish Professional Football League players ","title":"Nathan Tyson"},{"id":"2219733","text":"The Peugeot 4007 is a compact crossover SUV, produced for the French automobile manufacturer Peugeot, between July 2007 to April 2012.

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Chania, of which it is a municipal unit.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior The municipal unit has an area of . It is an important ferry and naval port at the head of Souda Bay. Souda is to the east of central Chania, although the area in between is mostly built-up. The town is a relatively new settlement, built on what used to be salt beds and marshland. The Turks knew the area as 'Tuzla', their name for salt-beds. In the 1870s, they began to build a new settlement here which grew as the port expanded. Souda Bay is one of the deepest natural harbours in the Mediterranean and is easy to defend. Now Souda is the arrival point for ferries from Piraeus. There is also a naval base located in Souda and across the bay, for NATO, with military accommodation and hospital in the town. Much of the command, particularly for US forces, is found across the bay on the Akrotiri. A grain silo overshadows the centre of town. Perhaps because of its nature as a departure point and military town, it is not popular with tourists and can appear seedy and threatening. However it is well-served with shops of all types and some renowned fish restaurants in the old centre. The Allied War Cemetery, mostly of soldiers from World War II, is found in Souda on the shore. There are 1,527 graves, mostly British with 447 New Zealanders and 197 Australians. Buried in the cemetery is the archaeologist John Pendlebury. Pendlebury was the curator at Knossos for the British School in Athens and had been continuing excavations in Crete until the war. He was executed by the Germans in 1941 whilst working for British Intelligence. ==Souda municipal unit== Souda was the main town in the former municipality of the same name, with the town hall found in Souda itself. The municipal unit extends from Chania's hinterland (Souda, Nerokourou and Tsikalaria) along the coast, taking in the villages of Kalami and Megala Chorafia. The Mayor of Souda, , was Ioannis Perakis. Around 8,000 people live in the municipal unit, the majority in Souda itself. Due to the area's beautiful views across the sea and up to the White Mountains and its proximity to Chania, there is a great deal of pressure to build new houses and apartments. However, there has been some protection afforded by the restrictions of having a military base in the area. ==Sinking of HMS York during WWII== During World War II the Royal Navy heavy cruiser HMS York was disabled at Souda Bay by two Italian explosive motorboats (Italian: barchini esplosivi) of the Italian Decima Flottiglia MAS, launched by destroyers Crispi and Sella on 26 March 1941. Six motorboats entered the bay, led by Lieutenant Luigi Faggioni, and attacked three targets in pairs; the first was York, second the tanker Pericles and last another ship at anchor. Three of the attacking craft had various problems, either mechanical or human, due to the extreme temperature conditions, but the other three successfully attacked their targets. Two motorboats, packed with 330-kilogramme (667 lb) charges in the bows, struck York amidships, flooding both boiler rooms and one engine room. Two seamen were killed. ==Gallery== File:Souda_Island.jpgThe islet of Souda, to the right of a smaller islet called Leon, within Souda Bay.

Taejo ruled from 918 to 943, achieving unification of the Later Three Kingdoms in 936. ==Background== Wang Geon was born in 877 to a powerful maritime merchant family based in Songak (modern Kaesong) as the eldest son of Wang Ryung (). He traced his ancestry to a noble Goguryeo clan. His ancestors were Goguryeo refugees who settled around Songak, accumulating great wealth through maritime trade and gaining control of the region, including the Ryesong River. During the Later Silla period, the northern regions, including Songak, were the strongholds of Goguryeo refugees, and Wang Geon's hometown of Songak would become the original capital of Later Goguryeo in 901. ==Rise to power== Taejo began his career in the turbulent Later Three Kingdoms (). In the later years of Silla, many local leaders and bandits rebelled against the rule of Queen Jinseong, who did not have strong enough leadership or policies to improve the condition of the people. Among those rebels, Gung Ye (Í∂ÅÏòà; ÂºìË£î) of the northwestern region and Gyeon Hwon (Í≤¨Ìõ§; ÁîÑËê±) of the southwest gained more power. They defeated and absorbed many of the other rebel groups as their troops marched against local Silla officials and bandits. In 895, Gung Ye led his forces into the far northwestern part of Silla, where Songdo was located. Taejo's father, Wang Yung (later Sejo of Goryeo), along with many local clans, quickly surrendered to Gung Ye. Wang Geon followed his father into service under Gung Ye, the future leader of Taebong, and he began his service under Gungye's command. Wang Geon's ability as a military commander was soon recognized by Gung Ye, who promoted him to general and even regarded him as his brother. In 900, he led a successful campaign against local clans and the army of Later Baekje in the Chungju area, gaining more fame and recognition from the king. In 903, he led a famous naval campaign against the southwestern coastline of Hubaekje (Keumsung, later Naju), while Gyeon Hwon was at war against Silla. He led several more military campaigns, and also helped conquered people who lived in poverty under Silla rule. The public favored him due to his leadership and generosity. In 913, he was appointed as prime minister of the newly renamed Taebong. Its king, Gung Ye, whose leadership helped found the kingdom but who began to refer to himself as the Buddha, began to persecute people who expressed their opposition against his religious arguments. He executed many monks, then later even his own wife and two sons, and the public began to turn away from him. His costly rituals and harsh rule caused even more opposition. ==Rise to the throne and founding of Goryeo== In 918, four top-ranked generals of Taebong‚ÄîHong Yu (ÌôçÏú†; Ê¥™ÂÑí), Bae Hyeongyeong (Î∞∞ÌòÑÍ≤Ω; Ë£µÁéÑÊÖ∂), Shin Sung-gyeom (Ïã†Ïà≠Í≤∏; Áî≥Â¥áË¨ô) and Bok Jigyeom (Î≥µÏßÄÍ≤∏; ÂçúÊô∫Ë¨ô)‚Äîmet secretly and agreed to overthrow Gung Ye's rule and crown Wang Geon as their new king. Wang Geon first opposed the idea but later agreed to their plan. The same year Gung Ye was overthrown and killed near the capital, Cheorwon. The generals installed Wang Geon as the new king of this short-lived state. He renamed the kingdom Goryeo, thus beginning the Goryeo Dynasty. The next year he moved the capital back to his hometown, Gaegyeong. He promoted Buddhism as Goryeo's national religion, and laid claim to the northern parts of the Korean Peninsula and Manchuria, which he considered his rightful legacy as the successor of Goguryeo. According to the Goryeosa, in 918, the ancient capital of Pyongyang had been in ruins for a long time and foreign barbarians were using the surrounding lands as hunting grounds and occasionally raiding the borders of Goryeo; therefore, in his first year as king, Wang Geon ordered his subjects to repopulate the ancient capital,\\"‰∏ôÁî≥Ë∞ïÁæ§Ëá£Êõ∞:‚ÄúÂπ≥Â£§Âè§ÈÉΩËçíÂ∫üËôΩ‰πÖ,Âü∫ÂùÄÂ∞ôÂ≠ò,ËÄåËçÜÊ£òÊªãËåÇ,ËïÉ‰∫∫Ê∏∏ÁåéÊñºÂÖ∂Èó¥,Âõ†ËÄå‰æµÊé†ËæπÈÇë,‰∏∫ÂÆ≥ Â§ßÁü£„ÄÇ ÂÆúÂæôÊ∞ëÂÆû‰πã‰ª•Âõ∫Ëó©Â±è‰∏∫Áôæ‰∏ñ‰πãÂà©\\"(È´ò‰∏ΩÂè≤) and soon sent his cousin Wang Sik-ryeom to defend it. Afterward, he decreed Pyongyang as the Western Capital. He also sought alliances and cooperation with local clans rather than trying to conquer and bring them under his direct control. ==The War of the Later Three Kingdoms== In 927, Gyeon Hwon of Hubaekje led forces into Silla's capital, Gyeongju, capturing and executing its king, King Gyeongae. Then he established King Gyeongsun as his puppet monarch before he turned his army toward Goryeo. Hearing of the news, Taejo planned a strike with 5,000 cavalrymen to attack Gyeon's troops on the way back home at Gongsan near Daegu.Il-yeon: Samguk Yusa: Legends and History of the Three Kingdoms of Ancient Korea, translated by Tae-Hung Ha and Grafton K. Mintz. Book Two, page 128. Silk Pagoda (2006). He met Hubaekje forces and suffered disastrous defeat, losing most of his army including his generals Kim Nak and Shin Sung-gyeom, the very same man who crowned Wang as a king. However, Goryeo quickly recovered from defeat and successfully defended Hubaekje's attack on its front. In 935, the last king of Silla, King Gyeongsun, felt there was no way to revive his kingdom and surrendered his entire land to Taejo. Taejo gladly accepted his surrender and gave him the title of prince, and accepted his daughter as one of his wives (Wang had six queens, and many more wives as he married daughters of every single local leader). It caused much disgust to Gyeon Hwon. Gyeon's father, who held his own claim to the Sangju region, also defected and surrendered to Goryeo and was received as the father of a king. In the same year, Gyeon Hwon's oldest son, Gyeon Singeom (), led a coup with his brothers Yanggeom and Yonggeom, against their father, who favored their half-brother, Geumgang, as his successor to the throne. Gyeon Hwon was sent into exile and imprisoned in Geumsansa, but escaped to Goryeo and was treated like Taejo's father, who died just before his surrender. ==Goryeo victory and unification== In 936, Wang led his final campaign against Singeom of Later Baekje. Singeom fought against Taejo, but facing much disadvantage and inner conflict, he surrendered to Taejo. Wang finally occupied Hubaekje formally, and unified the nation for the second time since Unified Silla; he ruled until 943, and died from disease. Taejo sought to bring even his enemies into his ruling coalition. He gave titles and land to rulers and nobles from the various countries he had defeated: Later Baekje, Silla, and also Balhae, which disintegrated around the same time. Thus he sought to secure stability and unity for his kingdom which had been lacking in the later years of Silla. After the destruction of Balhae by the Khitans in 926, Balhae's last crown prince and much of its ruling class sought refuge in Goryeo, where they were warmly welcomed and included into the ruling family by Wang Geon, thus uniting the two successor nations of Goguryeo. \\"When Parhae perished at the hands of the Khitan around this same time, much of its ruling class, who were of Kogury≈è descent, fled to Kory≈è. Wang K≈èn warmly welcomed them and generously gave them land. Along with bestowing the name Wang Kye (\\"Successor of the Royal Wang\\") on the Parhae crown prince, Tae Kwang-hy≈èn, Wang K≈èn entered his name in the royal household register, thus clearly conveying the idea that they belonged to the same lineage, and also had rituals performed in honor of his progenitor. Thus Kory≈è achieved a true national unification that embraced not only the Later Three Kingdoms but even survivors of Kogury≈è lineage from the Parhae kingdom.\\" Taejo felt a strong familial kinship with Balhae, calling it his \\"Relative Country\\" and \\"Married Country\\", and protected Balhae refugees, many of whom were also of Goguryeo origin. This was in strong contrast to Later Silla, which had endured a hostile relationship with Balhae. Taejo displayed strong animosity toward the Khitans who had destroyed Balhae. The Liao dynasty sent 30 envoys with 50 camels as a gift in 942, but Wang Geon exiled the envoys and starved the camels under a bridge in retribution for Balhae, despite the major diplomatic repercussions. Taejo proposed to Gaozu of Later J√¨n that they attack the Khitans as revenge for the destruction of Balhae, according to the Zizhi Tongjian. Furthermore, in his Ten Mandates to his descendants, he stated that the Khitans are no different than beasts and should be guarded against. ==Legacy== Portrait of Taejo at the Manwoldae Life-sized bronze statue of Taejo, constructed in 951, discovered in 1992 at Kaesong The unification of the Later Three Kingdoms in 936 was very important in Korean history; the unification of 668 CE by Silla was only a unification of approximately half of the peoples of the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity (who at the time largely considered themselves one people divided among many states), since the northern part was ruled by Balhae, which asserted itself as a reincarnation of Goguryeo. However, Wang Geon's unification in 936 was a more complete unification (in which only a single state emerged among the people, as opposed to the 7th century, when two, Later Silla and Balhae, emerged); the people of the Korean Peninsula thereafter remained under a single, unified state until 1948, when Korea was divided into north and south by Russian and U.S occupation forces. As noted elsewhere in this article, the modern name of \\"Korea\\" is derived from the name \\"Goryeo,\\" which itself is derived from \\"Goguryeo,\\" to whose heritage (and by extension, territory) Wang Geon and his new kingdom laid claim. As the first ruler to more fully unite the people of the Korean Peninsula under a single state, many modern-day Koreans look to his example for applicability to the current state of division on the Korean Peninsula. Tomb of Wang Geon During the early Goryeo dynasty, the title of crown prince () was only a peerage title for sons of the king; a separate title existed for the heir apparent (). ==Family== *Father: King Sejo of Goryeo (?

In 1996, Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (42 U.S.C. ¬ß 666), which required that states adopt UIFSA by January 1, 1998 or face loss of federal funding for child support enforcement. Every U.S. state has adopted either the 1996 or a later version of UIFSA. Whenever more than one state is involved in the establishing, enforcing or modifying a child or spousal support order, the act is implemented to determine the jurisdiction and power of the courts in the different states. The Act also establishes which state's law will be applied in proceedings under the Act, an important factor as support laws vary greatly among the states. The Act establishes rules requiring every state to defer to child support orders entered by the state courts of the child's home state. The place where the order was originally entered holds continuing exclusive jurisdiction (CEJ), and only the law of that state can be applied to requests to modify the order of child support, unless the courts of that state no longer have original tribunal jurisdiction (CEJ) under the Act. The Act also provides various direct interstate enforcement mechanisms. For example, it allows a caretaker parent to have an order mailed to the employer of the obligated parent, which will require that employer to withhold pay for the benefit of the child. Furthermore, it allows the caretaker parent to have an order mailed to an out-of-state court to get the other state to enforce the order. ==References== Category:Child support Interstate family support Category:1992 in law ","title":"Uniform Interstate Family Support Act"},{"id":"2219757","text":"Geek! is the debut EP by the alternative rock band My Bloody Valentine, released in December 1985 on Fever Records.

Owned by the News-Press & Gazette Company, it is sister to Palm Springs-licensed ABC affiliate KESQ-TV (channel 42) and four other low-power stations: Class A Fox affiliate KDFX-CD (channel 33, licensed to both Indio and Palm Springs), Palm Springs-licensed CW affiliate KCWQ-LD (channel 2), Indio-licensed Telemundo affiliate KUNA-LP (channel 15), and low-powered AccuWeather affiliate KYAV-LD (channel 12). The six stations share studios on Dunham Way in Thousand Palms; KPSP-CD's transmitter is located on Edom Hill northeast of Cathedral City and I-10. Along with other major Coachella Valley television stations, KPSP identifies itself on-air using its cable designation (CBS Local 2) rather than its over-the-air channel position. The unusual practice stems in part from the area's exceptionally high cable penetration rate of 80.5% which is one of the highest in the United States. In addition to its own digital signal, KPSP is simulcast in standard definition on KESQ's second digital subchannel (virtual and UHF channel 42.2) from the same Edom Hill transmitter facility. ==History== Logo until 2008. The station launched September 2, 2002 and aired an analog signal on UHF channel 38. Prior to its sign-on as the Coachella Valley's first ever CBS affiliate, programming from the network came into the market via cable or antenna (in some areas) through Los Angeles flagship owned-and-operated station KCBS-TV. When KPSP went on-the-air, area cable companies displaced KCBS at that outlet's request. KPSP adopted the \\"CBS 2\\" moniker following the practice of major local competitors in using its cable designation for branding purposes. On April 1, 2008, it switched from branding itself \\"CBS 2\\" to \\"KPSP Local 2\\" although the \\"CBS 2\\" logo was retained for several months afterwards. On January 31, 2012, KPSP was sold by Desert Television to the News-Press & Gazette Company becoming a sister station to KESQ. It moved from its own studios on Dunham Way in Thousand Palms to KESQ's facility in Palm Desert. KPSP's transmitter on 38.1, went silent at midnight on March 1, 2012; the station's license was not initially included in the deal. CBS programming is now broadcast on 42.2 on the KESQ-DT digital tier and the lineup has not changed.http://www.kesq.com/cbs/30578368/detail.html In January 2013, News Press & Gazette acquired the KPSP-CD license, as well as KYAV-LD, from Desert Television. The Class A channel 38 digital transmitter was turned back on on February 7, allowing CBS programming to be shown over the air in 1080i high definition for the first time in nearly a year. NPG's acquisition of the Desert Television assets was completed on April 26. ==Digital televisionDigital channels=== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {  - ! Channel ! Video ! Aspect !

The CBS Evening News would therefore be seen in the regular time period at 6:30. The station would eventually move the CBS Evening News to 5:30 p.m. After KPSP was acquired by KESQ, this station had its operations temporarily merged into that outlet's facility. Local news offerings on both outlets were adjusted as a result. Later, both stations moved back to the Dunham Way location and operated separately out of different studios for seven years. On December 2, 2018, the CBS Local 2 news brand was discontinued and all news offerings on CBS Local 2 were offered under a unified News Channel 3 branding. The staff previously assigned to CBS Local 2 newscasts were folded into the News Channel 3 brand on all stations. On April 24, 2019, the space previously occupied by the CBS Local 2 news set was launched with a new set supporting the local Telemundo affiliate's Spanish newscasts. FOX affiliate KDFX-CD airs a nightly hour prime time newscast at 10:00 produced by KESQ featuring the News Channel 3 branding and anchors. The program competes with low-powered MyNetworkTV affiliate KPSG-LP (now KPSE-LD), which had local news seen for thirty minutes at the same time produced by rival NBC affiliate KMIR-TV. ===Notable former staff=== *Adrianna Costa (has since worked as Entertainment Reporter for Good Day L.A., E!

He is best known as being the vocalist of boyband Ultra. ==Biography== Hearn attended the same high school as Ultra's guitarist and drummer, Mike Harwood and Jon O'Mahony, respectively, where they met. He was in the same class as Harwood, and O'Mahony was a couple of years older. Hearn went on to the University of Leeds and studied Geography and Management, graduating in 1999.

It was released as a non-album single on 9 November 1987 on Lazy Records. It was the band's second release for Lazy and the first release to feature vocalist and guitarist Bilinda Butcher, who was recruited in April 1987 following the departure of original vocalist David Conway. \\"Strawberry Wine\\" was released as a 12-inch single in a limited pressing of 2,500 copies. The contents of the single were later combined with My Bloody Valentine's following release, the mini album Ecstasy (1987), and reissued on the compilation album Ecstasy and Wine (1989). The compilation album was released without the band's consent and due to an error, an alternate mix of \\"Strawberry Wine\\" was used. Upon its release, \\"Strawberry Wine\\" received moderate critical acclaim and peaked at number 13 on the United Kingdom Independent Singles Chart. Critics, who compared and contrasted it to Ecstasy, referred to the single as \\"certainly the better of the two releases\\" and described the title track as \\"still sounding in parts like the old Valentines with a strong Mamas & Papas type vocal line\\".

His mother Pauline n√©e von Mihalovits was the daughter of a Hungarian noble family. He received higher education in Leipzig, where his father had become manager of the Leipzig City Theatre in 1876. Soon after starting a banker's career in Berlin in 1882, Neumann came across the works of Arthur Schopenhauer. From 1884 he became absorbed in philosophical works and showed great interest for the Indian sources that had inspired Schopenhauer. He turned his back on banking and started to attend a college in Prague. By 1887 Neumann was back in Berlin, studying Indology, Religion and Philosophy at the university there. Soon after his marriage to Camilla n√©e Nordmann from Vienna, Neumann went to Halle and in 1891 finished his thesis on a Pali text, his Ph. D. supervisor was Richard Pischel. In the same year he published Zwei buddhistische Suttas und ein Traktat Meister Eckharts (\\"Two Buddhist Suttas and a treatise of Meister Eckhart\\"). In 1892, after returning to Vienna, Neumann published an anthology of texts from the Pali Canon in German on the occasion of Schopenhauer‚Äôs 104th birthday. Having finished a translation of the Dhammapada in 1893, Neumann realized his great desire to visit the original countries of Buddhism. For a few months he traveled through India and Ceylon, meeting members of the sangha, such as the monk Sumangala Maha Thera and Lama Dondamdup. Besides praise for the knowledge and learning of monks, he also found critical words for what he considered an adulteration and watering down of the original teaching of the Buddha. Back in Vienna in 1894 he took up a post at the Oriental Institute of the University of Vienna as an assistant to the Indologist Georg B√ºhler. Within the next few years, Neumann translated and published the Majjhima NikƒÅya in three volumes. In 1896 he began a friendship and lively correspondence with (18711957) from Bari. De Lorenzo translated Neumann's works into Italian and thus became one of the pioneers of Italian Buddhism. Neumann's grave in the Vienna Central Cemetery In 1906 Neumann lost his fortune in a bank crash and even had to sell (temporarily) the highly esteemed Siamese edition of the Tipi·π≠aka, given to him as a present by Chulalongkorn, the king of Siam. His financial situation slightly improved through the legacy after his father's death. In 1907 he published the first volume of the Dƒ´gha NikƒÅya with Piper publishers in Munich. Neumann died in poverty in 1915, and is buried at the Vienna Central Cemetery. His grave, forgotten and neglected for two generations, came to light again by the end of the twentieth century and is being attended to by the Buddhists of Vienna. Today, his translations are viewed as \\"outdated in many respects\\", but represent \\"significant pioneering work\\". == Works == * Neumann, Karl Eugen, trans.

In that role, he advanced through the Bolan Pass to Quetta, and then on to Kandahar in January 1879. In March 1880, he made a difficult march from Kandahar to Kabul, fighting on the way the Battle of Ahmed Khel and Battle of Arzu, and then holding supreme military and civil command in northern Afghanistan. He became Commander-in-Chief, India in April 1881 and a member of the Council of the Secretary of State for India in 1893. ==Early life== Born the son of Robert Stewart and Flora Stewart (n√©e Martin) at Mount Pleasant, near Forres, Moray in Scotland, Stewart was educated at schools at Findhorn, Dufftown and Elgin and at the University of Aberdeen.Elsmie, pp. 1-17 ==Career== Lieutenant General Donald Stewart during the Second Anglo- Afghan War.

He led the march across harsh terrain and into several cavalry battles against Afghan forces on his way to occupying Kandahar in January 1879. He was promoted to commander in chief in India in April 1881 and to field marshal in 1894. He is shown here in the uniform of a lieutenant general.Caption to Indian Celebrities- Sir Donald Stewart WDL11439.png, Library of Congress Stewart was commissioned as an ensign in the 9th Bengal Native Infantry on 12 October 1840 and was promoted to lieutenant on 3 January 1844 and to captain on 1 June 1854.Heathcote, p. 270 Later that year he served on the Aka Khel Expedition to the North-West Frontier. During the Indian Rebellion, after a famous ride from Agra to Delhi with dispatches, Stewart served as the deputy assistant adjutant-general at the Siege of Delhi in Summer 1857 and then as assistant adjutant-general at the Siege of Lucknow in Autumn 1857. After serving through the campaign in Rohilkhand he was promoted to major on 19 January 1858 and to lieutenant-colonel on 20 July 1858. He became deputy-adjutant-general of the Bengal Army in 1862 and, having been promoted to colonel on 20 July 1863, he commanded the Bengal brigade in the Abyssinian expedition in 1867. Promoted to major-general on 24 December 1868, he became commandant of the penal settlement of the Andaman Islands, and was present when one of the inmates assassinated Lord Mayo, British Viceroy of India, in 1872.Heathcote, p. 271 After being exonerated in the subsequent inquiry, he was appointed Commander of the troops at Lahore in 1876. Promoted to lieutenant-general on 1 October 1877, Stewart commanded the Quetta Army during the Second Anglo-Afghan War advancing through the Bolan Pass to Quetta, and then on to Kandahar in January 1879. In March 1880, he made a difficult march from Kandahar to Kabul, fighting on the way the Battle of Ahmed Khel and Battle of Arzu, and then holding supreme military and civil command in northern Afghanistan. On hearing of the Maiwand disaster, he despatched Sir Frederick Roberts with a division on his celebrated march from Kabul to Kandahar, while he led the rest of the army back to India through the Khyber Pass. For this he was given the thanks of parliament and created a baronet. The Battle of Ahmed Khel, at which Stewart led the British forces, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War Stewart became Military member of the Council of the Governor-General of India (effectively War Minister) in October 1880 and, having been promoted to full general on 1 July 1881, he became Commander-in- Chief, India in April 1881. In order to achieve efficiency savings he proposed merging the Bengal Army, Madras Army and Bombay Army into a single military force but this was rejected by the India Office. During the Panjdeh Incident in March 1885 he secured a significant increase in the number of British troops in India. He returned to London to become a member of the Council of the Secretary of State for India in 1893 and, in that role, again argued - this time successfully - for the creation of a single Indian Army. He was promoted to field marshal on 26 May 1894 and became a member of the Royal Commission on Indian civil and military expenditure as well as Governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea from 1895 until his death on 26 March 1900.

Johnson began his career with Wycombe Wanderers, where he spent six years as a professional. He then joined Welsh side Cardiff City in 2006 for ¬£275,000. He was part of the team that reached the 2008 FA Cup Final and was twice chosen as the club's Player of the Year in his three-year stint with the club. He moved into the Premier League by signing for Birmingham City in 2009 for ¬£5 million, with whom he won the 2011 League Cup. He departed Birmingham in 2011 after their relegation to join Midlands neighbours Wolverhampton Wanderers, with whom he suffered two further consecutive relegations, leading to his exclusion from first team involvement. After loan spells with Sheffield Wednesday and West Ham United, Johnson left Wolves by mutual consent, and spent the latter part of the 2014‚Äì15 season with Charlton Athletic. He played for Indian Super League club Pune City in 2015 before returning to Charlton in January 2016. Released at the end of the season, Johnson signed a short-term contract with Bromley in October 2017. ==CareerWycombe Wanderers=== Johnson spent time at Portsmouth and Bournemouth before joining Wycombe Wanderers as a 15-year- old, where he developed through the club's youth system. He made his first- team debut for Wycombe in the final game of the 1999‚Äì2000 season against Cambridge United,Soccerbase omit Johnson's debut appearance, against Cambridge United on 6 May 2000, attributing it to another player: becoming the youngest ever player to make a Football League appearance for the club at the time, at the age of 17 years and 8 days. The following season, Johnson also made one substitute appearance, and was on the bench as Wycombe beat Premier League club Leicester City in the FA Cup quarter finals. The 2003‚Äì04 season saw Johnson in and out of the side under manager Tony Adams but he was still awarded the Fans' Player of the Year Award. After the departure of Adams after one season (6 months), Johnson became a regular in the side and was handed the captaincy by new manager John Gorman when he took over in November 2004, as well as finishing second in the player of the year award to forward Nathan Tyson. ===Cardiff City=== After 183 appearances and 22 goals for Wycombe, Johnson joined Cardiff City on 4 July 2006 for a fee of ¬£275,000; Cardiff's local rivals Swansea City ¬£100,000 bid was rejected. Johnson had a strong first year at Cardiff, and after spending the first six months as a regular substitute, began to form a dominant pairing with Dutchman Glenn Loovens which saw them keep club captain Darren Purse out of the side. In the 2007‚Äì08 season he began to score goals, with late winners against Norwich City in the League and Brighton & Hove Albion in the League Cup, as well as vital equalisers against Hull City and Preston North End. Johnson scored the second goal of Cardiff's memorable 2‚Äì0 away victory over Premier League Middlesbrough in the 2007‚Äì08 FA Cup quarter final, and his header in the Severnside Derby match against Bristol City in March 2008 was his seventh goal of the season. He played in all six of Cardiff's matches on their way to the FA Cup Final, in which they lost 1‚Äì0 to Portsmouth, and at the end of the season he was awarded the club's Player of the Year award. The summer transfer window saw prolonged interest in Johnson; both Ipswich Town and West Bromwich Albion had bids rejected. Despite the interest Johnson remained with the side into the new season although he did see his centre-back partner Glenn Loovens leave to join Celtic. On the opening day of the season, Johnson scored a late winning goal against Southampton as Cardiff came away with a 2‚Äì1 win. Despite continued changes in his defensive partner, having played alongside Loovens, Purse and new signing G√°bor Gyepes, who forced his way into the side past Purse in November, Johnson passed 100 appearances for the club, and had played every minute of the season until he had to leave the field during a 2‚Äì0 victory over Crystal Palace on 11 April 2009, after being hit in the throat by an elbow from Palace defender Claude Davis. After the incident Johnson suffered breathing difficulties and was forced to spend two nights in hospital as well as having daily checks throughout the following week. Davies was found guilty of violent conduct by the Football Association and banned for three matches. Johnson was forced to miss the next match, a 3‚Äì1 win over Burnley, but returned for the 6‚Äì0 defeat to Preston North End the following week. He was chosen as the club's player of the year for the second year running, and was named in the Championship Team of the Year. ===Birmingham City=== Playing for Birmingham, September 2009In June 2009, after two previous bids had been rejected, Cardiff accepted an offer of ¬£5m from Birmingham City. Johnson, described by former teammate Tony Capaldi as \\"definitely captain material\\", signed a three-year deal with the club on 25 June 2009, stating \\"Premier League football is the dream at the start of any footballer's career so I am pleased I have been given that chance with Birmingham and I can't wait to get started.\\" He made \\"an impressive debut\\" in Birmingham's first match of the season, a 1‚Äì0 defeat at Manchester United. He was part of the Birmingham team which went 12 games unbeaten, a club record for the top flight; at Christmas, The Times' correspondent Patrick Barclay described Johnson and defensive partner Scott Dann as \\"the players of 2009‚Äì10 thus far\\"; and Johnson was suggested as a possible England player. Johnson scored his first goal for the club away against Bolton Wanderers on 29 August 2010, and his second opened the scoring in the Second City derby against Aston Villa in January 2011. Johnson's header set up the opening goal for Nikola ≈Ωigiƒá as Birmingham City defeated favourites Arsenal 2‚Äì1 to win the 2011 Football League Cup Final. The Daily Telegraph described him as \\"an inspiring defensive presence throughout\\". ===Wolverhampton Wanderers=== On 11 July 2011, Birmingham accepted a bid from Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers for Johnson. Two days later, Johnson signed a four-year contract with Wolves. The fee was officially undisclosed, and the club claimed that reports of a ¬£7m fee were inaccurate; the Wolverhampton-based Express & Star newspaper reported that the club had paid \\"a flat fee with no add-ons\\" of \\"just over ¬£4m\\". Johnson was almost immediately handed the captaincy of Wolves by Mick McCarthy shortly before the start of the new season, relieving former captain Karl Henry of his duties. The season proved problematic for Johnson and his new team though and McCarthy was sacked in February 2012, following which Johnson said the players had let the manager down. After assistant manager Terry Connor was promoted to fill the vacancy, Johnson featured in only two further matches that season. During March 2012 he was disciplined by the club after turning up for training \\"unfit to train properly\\", widely reported as being due to alcohol; the player apologised for his conduct, and retained the captaincy. Later that same month, he had an on-field dispute with teammate Wayne Hennessey. With the club relegated back to the Championship, new manager St√•le Solbakken brought Johnson back into the team. Solbakken was however dismissed in January 2013, and although Johnson retained his place in the team, once again the club were relegated, meaning Johnson had now been relegated in each of the last three seasons. With the arrival of Kenny Jackett as Wolves manager, it was announced in June 2013 that Johnson was available for transfer and he was not issued with a squad number. No sale took place during the summer transfer window, and on 16 September, Johnson joined Championship club Sheffield Wednesday on loan for three months. He made 17 loan appearances before the deal expired, but Sheffield Wednesday caretaker manager Stuart Gray confirmed that he was attempting to extend the loan agreement. On 6 January 2014, he joined Premier League club West Ham United on loan for the remainder of the 2013‚Äì14 season. Johnson played six games in all competitions for West Ham, his first coming on 8 January 2014 in a 6‚Äì0 away defeat to Manchester City in a semi-final of the League Cup. Johnson remained at Wolves, now back in the Championship, at the start of the 2014‚Äì15 season after the club received no offers during the close season for the player. He was again not issued with a squad number and did not play any first team football during the first half of the campaign. In an interview on Soccer AM, Johnson revealed he trained during afternoons, away from the first team group, but \\"would probably give up a fair amount of money if I just walked out\\". On 2 February 2015, the final day of the January transfer window, it was announced that his contract with Wolves had been terminated by mutual consent. ===Charlton Athletic=== On 3 February 2015, following the termination of his contract with Wolves, Johnson signed a deal with Championship side Charlton Athletic to last until the end of the season. He started 14 of Charlton's remaining 16 matches. On 12 May 2015, Johnson was released at the end of his contract. ===Pune City=== On 18 August 2015, Johnson joined Indian Super League side FC Pune City for the 2015 tournament. ===Return to Charlton Athletic=== On 4 January 2016, Johnson re-signed for Charlton Athletic on an 18-month contract. He was released in May 2017. ===Bromley=== Johnson signed for National League club Bromley on a short-term deal in October 2017. He made his debut on 14 October in an FA Cup fourth qualifying round match away to Dover Athletic, playing until the 90th minute and helping his team achieve a goalless draw. Johnson helped Bromley reach the FA Trophy final at Wembley Stadium against Brackley Town, however he conceded an own goal in the 95th minute. Bromley went on to lose on a penalty shoot- out.

The only piece of the wreckage ever found was a lifebelt. As of , she remains the last known ship sunk by an iceberg with casualties. ==Description== Hans Hedtoft was long, with a beam of and a depth of . She was assessed at , . Hans Hedtoft was built by Frederikshavns V√¶rft at Frederikshavn in northern Denmark. She was yard number 226, launched on 13 August 1958 and completed on 17 December. She had a double bottom and seven watertight compartments and an armoured bow and stern. She was designed to provide a year-round service between Denmark and Greenland. Like the , Hans Hedtoft had a riveted hull, a feature which was criticised by Knud Lauritzen, a shipowner. Lauritzen claimed that a riveted hull was not as resistant to ice pressure as a welded hull. Hans Hedtoft had the Code Letters and radio callsign OXKA. The ship was named for a former prime minister of Denmark. The ship was armed with three 40 mm anti-aircraft guns, on the orders of the Danish Ministry of Defence (MoD). The armament was not part of the original plans, and the ship was strengthened in three places to take the guns. An ammunition room was built into the bow of the ship. The MoD provided the anti-aircraft guns free of charge. Although fitted during tests, the guns were dismounted and carried aboard Hans Hedtoft at the time of her sinking. An order had been issued that the guns were to be removed from the ship immediately after she arrived back in Copenhagen. It was claimed that the arming of Hans Hedtoft resulted in a warship being constructed without the approval of the Folketing. ==Sinking== Hans Hedtoft sailed from Copenhagen on her maiden voyage on 7 January 1959. Her voyage to Julianehaab, Greenland, was made in record time. Hans Hedtoft called at Nuuk, Sisimiut and Maniitsoq before returning to Julianehaab. USCGC Campbell On 29 January, she began her return journey. The ship had 40 crew, 55 passengers and a cargo of frozen fish on board and in addition to that 3,25 tons of archives concerning Greenlandic history.Lastmanifest of 6th February 1959: Vedr. Godth√•bslastens placering i m/s \\"Hans Hedtoft\\" One of her passengers was the Danish parliament (Folketing) member Augo Lynge. The next day, Hans Hedtoft collided with an iceberg about south of Cape Farewell, the southernmost point of Greenland. A distress call was given at 13:56 (local time) stating that the ship had hit an iceberg at . The call was answered by the USCGC Campbell, the West German trawler Johannes Kr√ºss of Bremerhaven and another West German trawler. Within an hour, another message was sent stating that the engine room was flooded. At 15:12, it was announced that the ship was sinking. A final message was sent at 17:41 stating the ship was slowly sinking and requesting immediate assistance. Aircraft in Newfoundland were grounded by the weather and unable to assist in the search for Hans Hedtoft. The beginning of an SOS was received by Johannes Kr√ºss at 17:41 after which communication with Hans Hedtoft was lost. On 31 January, USCGC Campbell reported that conditions were the worst seen and there was no sign of Hans Hedtoft or her passengers and crew. The search was called off on 7 February. The only piece of wreckage ever recovered was a lifebuoy which washed ashore on Iceland and discovered on 7 October 1959, some nine months after the ship sank. The ship sank with parish registers from parishes of Greenland, which were meant to be deposited in archives in Denmark, causing a major loss for Greenlandic genealogy. As a result of the sinking, the airfield at Narsarsuaq, Greenland, which had closed in November 1958, was reopened. An appeal fund for the relatives of the victims was opened. Kr40,000 (then ¬£2,000) was raised amongst ten countries in two months. Compensation for the relatives amounted to Kr1,184,936 (then ¬£59,000). Like the RMS Titanic, Hans Hedtoft was said to be the safest ship afloat, being described as \\"unsinkable\\" by some. ==Legacy== On 30 January 2005, Queen Margrethe unveiled a monument at North Atlantic Wharf, Copenhagen, to the 95 people lost on Hans Hedtoft.

As a player, he was a defender from 1990 until 2007, notably in the Premier League for Everton and Wigan Athletic, as well as in the Football League for Luton Town, Preston North End, Charlton Athletic, Queens Park Rangers, Birmingham City, Norwich City, Watford and Blackpool. He earned 10 caps for the England U21 side. ==Playing career== Jackson was born on 19 October 1971 in Leeds. He grew up in Bedford and attended Sharnbrook Upper School. After initially turning down the club to concentrate on finishing his A-Levels, he started his footballing career at Luton Town, making his professional debut in 1990. He made nine league appearances for the club before signing for Everton for a fee of ¬£600,000 in 1991. He featured prominently in Everton's FA Cup-winning season, scoring a memorable 20-yard volley against Bristol City in the Fourth Round to secure a 1‚Äì0 victory for Everton. He also scored the opening goal in the 4‚Äì1 win against Tottenham Hotspur in the semi final, and his initial cross ultimately set up Paul Rideout's winning goal in the final. In 1996, he joined Norwich City for a fee of ¬£450,000. In 1997, he became team captain, and was voted Norwich City player of the year in 1998. On 19 October 2001, Jackson moved to Wigan Athletic on a month's loan from Norwich, making his debut a day later in a 3‚Äì2 defeat against Wrexham. He made seven appearances during his loan spell before joining the club permanently on a free transfer, signing a two and a half year contract. He would go on to form a central defensive partnership with Jason De Vos that was central to winning the Second Division Championship in the 2002‚Äì03 season. After De Vos left Wigan for Ipswich Town, Jackson again formed another sound partnership with Ian Breckin and helped Wigan to their second promotion in three years when they finished runners-up in the Football League Championship in 2004‚Äì05. In November 2006, Jackson scored for Wigan in a 3‚Äì2 win against Charlton Athletic, his first goal in the Premier League in over 13 years (setting a league record for time between goals ‚Äì 4,935 days ‚Äì which still stands as of April 2019). Jackson signed for Watford on 24 May 2007, after rejecting a new one-year contract with Wigan. He spent a month on loan at Blackpool during late October and early November 2007. Watford recalled him on 5 November after an injury to Jay DeMerit. Jackson retired from football on 6 August 2008. ==Personal life== After retiring, he was employed as a football consultant by IMG working in player development. In 2015 he was working for Wigan Athletic as an Operations Manager but as of 2020, he is no longer listed at the club in that role. ==Honours== * FA Cup winner 1995 * FA Charity Shield winner 1995 * Football League Second Division champion 2002‚Äì03 * Football League Championship runner-up 2004‚Äì05 * League Cup runner-up 2006 * Norwich City player of the year 1997‚Äì98 ==Notes *Matt Jackson profile at watfordfc.co.uk * *Career information at ex-canaries.co.uk Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Birmingham City F.C. players Category:Charlton Athletic F.C. players Category:English footballers Category:England under-21 international footballers Category:Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:Everton F.C. players Category:Luton Town F.C. players Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C. players Category:Wigan Athletic F.C. players Category:Watford F.C. players Category:Blackpool F.C. players Category:People educated at Sharnbrook Academy Category:Wigan Athletic F.C. non-playing staff Category:Association football defenders ","title":"Matt Jackson (footballer)"},{"id":"2219827","text":"Matthew Kauffman (born October 5, 1961 in Princeton, New Jersey) is an American investigative journalist and two-time Pulitzer Prize finalist.

A National Historic Landmark, Colonial Michilimackinac is accredited by American Association of Museums. ==Fort Michilimackinac== Fort Michilimackinac was an 18th-century French, and later British, fort and trading post in the Great Lakes of North America. Built around 1715, it was located along the southern shore of the strategic Straits of Mackinac connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, at the northern tip of the lower peninsula of the present-day state of Michigan in the United States. The site of the fort in present-day Mackinaw City, Michigan is a National Historic Landmark and is now preserved as an open-air historical museum.https://www.stateparks.com/fort_michilimackinac_state_park_in_michigan.html, FORT MICHILIMACKINAC STATE PARK - History ==History== Mackinac Bridge from the state park Old Mackinac Point Lighthouse This site housed a French fort but that was compromised by the British and became their trading post system, stretching from the Mississippi River through the Illinois Country to the St. Lawrence River. The fort served as a supply for traders in the western Great Lakes. The French had first established a presence in the Straits of Mackinac in 1671 when Father Jacques Marquette established a Jesuit mission at present- day St. Ignace, Michigan. In 1683, they augmented the mission with Fort de Buade. In 1701, Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, sieur de Cadillac moved the French garrison to Fort Detroit and closed the mission. By 1715, however, the French built Fort Michilimackinac to re-establish a presence along the Straits of Mackinac. The French relinquished the fort, along with their territory in Canada, to the British in 1761 following their loss in the French and Indian War. Although British continued to operate the fort as a major trading post, the Ojibwe (Chippewa) in the region resented British policies as harsh. On June 2, 1763, as part of the larger movement known as Pontiac's Rebellion, a group of Ojibwe staged a game of bag'gat'tway (lacrosse) outside the fort as a ruse to gain entrance. After gaining entrance to the fort, they killed most of the British inhabitants and held the fort for a year before the British retook it. The British eventually deemed the wooden fort on the mainland too vulnerable to attack, and in 1781 they built Fort Mackinac, a limestone fort on nearby Mackinac Island. Fort Michilimackinac was abandoned after the move. The fort grounds were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. It is a popular tourist attraction as part of Colonial Michilimackinac State Park in Mackinaw City. The site has numerous reconstructed historical wooden structures and is considered the most extensively excavated early French archaeological site in the United States, with ongoing excavations each summer. There are daily cannon and musket firing demonstrations performed by costumed interpreters. There are also accurate cooking demonstrations in which park visitors can participate. ==References *Colonial Michilimackinac *Michigan's official Travel site *Information and photos about the park's history *National Park Service Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings - Fort Michilimackinac Category:Archaeological sites in Michigan Category:State parks of Michigan Category:Museums in Emmet County, Michigan Category:Living museums in Michigan Category:Protected areas of Emmet County, Michigan ","title":"Fort Michilimackinac State Park"},{"id":"2219841","text":"Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is a means of converting nitrogen oxides, also referred to as with the aid of a catalyst into diatomic nitrogen (), and water (). A reductant, typically anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia or urea solution, is added to a stream of flue or exhaust gas and is absorbed onto a catalyst. As the reaction drives toward completion, Carbon dioxide, is produced. Selective catalytic reduction of using ammonia as the reducing agent was patented in the United States by the Engelhard Corporation in 1957. Development of SCR technology continued in Japan and the US in the early 1960s with research focusing on less expensive and more durable catalyst agents. The first large-scale SCR was installed by the IHI Corporation in 1978.Steam: Its Generation and Uses. Babcock & Wilcox. Commercial selective catalytic reduction systems are typically found on large utility boilers, industrial boilers, and municipal solid waste boilers and have been shown to reduce by 70-95%. More recent applications include diesel engines, such as those found on large ships, diesel locomotives, gas turbines, and even automobiles. SCR systems are now the preferred method for meeting Tier 4 Final and EURO 6 diesel emissions standards for heavy trucks, and also for cars and light commercial vehicles. In many cases, emissions of NOx and PM (Particulate Matter) have been reduced by upwards of 90% when compared with vehicles of the early 1990s. ==Chemistry== The reduction reaction takes place as the gases pass through the catalyst chamber. Before entering the catalyst chamber the ammonia, or other reductant (such as urea), is injected and mixed with the gases. The chemical equation for a stoichiometric reaction using either anhydrous or aqueous ammonia for a selective catalytic reduction process is: :2\\\\text{NO}+2\\\\text{NH}_{3}+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\text{O}_{2}\\\\,\\\\rightarrow\\\\,2\\\\text{N}_{2}+3\\\\text{H}_{2}\\\\text{O} :\\\\text{NO}_{2}+2\\\\text{NH}_{3}+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\text{O}_{2}\\\\,\\\\rightarrow\\\\,\\\\frac{3}{2}\\\\text{N}_{2}+3\\\\text{H}_{2}\\\\text{O} :\\\\text{NO}+\\\\text{NO}_{2}+2\\\\text{NH}_{3}\\\\,\\\\rightarrow\\\\,2\\\\text{N}_{2}+3\\\\text{H}_{2}\\\\text{O} With several secondary reactions: :\\\\text{SO}_{2}+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\text{O}_{2}\\\\,\\\\rightarrow\\\\,\\\\text{SO}_{3} :2\\\\text{NH}_{3}+\\\\text{SO}_{3}+\\\\text{H}_{2}\\\\text{O}\\\\,\\\\rightarrow\\\\,\\\\left(\\\\text{NH}_{4}\\\\right)_{2}\\\\text{SO}_{4} :\\\\text{NH}_{3}+\\\\text{SO}_{3}+\\\\text{H}_{2}\\\\text{O}\\\\,\\\\rightarrow\\\\,\\\\text{NH}_{4}\\\\text{HSO}_{4} The reaction for urea instead of either anhydrous or aqueous ammonia is: :2\\\\text{NO}+\\\\text{CO}\\\\left(\\\\text{NH}_{2}\\\\right)_{2}+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\text{O}_{2}\\\\,\\\\rightarrow\\\\,2\\\\text{N}_{2}+2\\\\text{H}_{2}\\\\text{O}+\\\\text{CO}_{2} The ideal reaction has an optimal temperature range between 630 and 720 K, but can operate from 500 to 720 K with longer residence times. The minimum effective temperature depends on the various fuels, gas constituents, and catalyst geometry. Other possible reductants include cyanuric acid and ammonium sulfate.\\"Environmental Effects of Nitrogen Oxides\\". Electric Power Research Institute, 1989 ==Catalysts== SCR catalysts are made from various ceramic materials used as a carrier, such as titanium oxide, and active catalytic components are usually either oxides of base metals (such as vanadium, molybdenum and tungsten), zeolites, or various precious metals. Another catalyst based on activated carbon was also developed which is applicable for the removal of NOx at low temperatures. CarboTech AC GmbH Each catalyst component has advantages and disadvantages. Base metal catalysts, such as the vanadium and tungsten, lack high thermal durability, but are less expensive and operate very well at the temperature ranges most commonly seen in industrial and utility boiler applications. Thermal durability is particularly important for automotive SCR applications that incorporate the use of a diesel particulate filter with forced regeneration. They also have a high catalysing potential to oxidize into , which can be extremely damaging due to its acidic properties.DOE presentation Zeolite catalysts have the potential to operate at substantially higher temperature than base metal catalysts; they can withstand prolonged operation at temperatures of 900 K and transient conditions of up to 1120 K. Zeolites also have a lower potential for potentially damaging oxidation. Iron- and copper-exchanged zeolite urea SCRs have been developed with approximately equal performance to that of vanadium- urea SCRs if the fraction of the is 20% to 50% of the total . The two most common catalyst geometries used today are honeycomb catalysts and plate catalysts. The honeycomb form usually consists of an extruded ceramic applied homogeneously throughout the carrier or coated on the substrate. Like the various types of catalysts, their configuration also has advantages and disadvantages. Plate-type catalysts have lower pressure drops and are less susceptible to plugging and fouling than the honeycomb types, but are much larger and more expensive. Honeycomb configurations are smaller than plate types, but have higher pressure drops and plug much more easily. A third type is corrugated, comprising only about 10% of the market in power plant applications. ==Reductants== Several reductants are currently used in SCR applications including anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia or urea. All those three reductants are widely available in large quantities. Anhydrous ammonia can be stored as a liquid at approximately 10 bar in steel tanks. It is classified as an inhalation hazard, but it can be safely stored and handled if well-developed codes and standards are followed. Its advantage is that it needs no further conversion to operate within an SCR and is typically favoured by large industrial SCR operators. Aqueous ammonia must be vaporized in order to be used, but it is substantially safer to store and transport than anhydrous ammonia. Urea is the safest to store, but requires conversion to ammonia through thermal decomposition in order to be used as an effective reductant. ==Limitations== SCR systems are sensitive to contamination and plugging resulting from normal operation or abnormal events. Many SCRs are given a finite life due to known amounts of contaminants in the untreated gas. The large majority of catalyst on the market is of porous construction. A clay planting pot is a good example of what SCR catalyst feels like. This porosity is what gives the catalyst the high surface area essential for reduction of NOx. However, the pores are easily plugged by fine particulates, ammonium sulfate, ammonium bisulfate (ABS), and silicon compounds. Many of these contaminants can be removed while the unit is on line by ultrasonic horns or soot blowers. The unit can also be cleaned during a turnaround or by raising the exhaust temperature. Of more concern to SCR performance are poisons, which will degrade the catalyst and render it ineffective at NOx reduction, possibly resulting in the oxidation of ammonia which will increase NOx emissions. These poisons are halogens, alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, arsenic, phosphorus, antimony, chromium, lead, mercury, and copper. Most SCRs require tuning to properly perform. Part of tuning involves ensuring a proper distribution of ammonia in the gas stream and uniform gas velocity through the catalyst. Without tuning, SCRs can exhibit inefficient NOx reduction along with excessive ammonia slip due to not utilizing the catalyst surface area effectively. Another facet of tuning involves determining the proper ammonia flow for all process conditions. Ammonia flow is in general controlled based on NOx measurements taken from the gas stream or preexisting performance curves from an engine manufacturer (in the case of gas turbines and reciprocating engines). Typically, all future operating conditions must be known beforehand to properly design and tune an SCR system. Ammonia slip is an industry term for ammonia passing through the SCR unreacted. This occurs when the amount of ammonia injected is excessive, temperatures are too low for ammonia to react, or the catalyst has degraded. Temperature is SCR's largest limitation. Engines all have a period during a start-up where exhaust temperatures are too cool for NOx reduction to occur, especially in cold climates. ==Power plants== In power stations, the same basic technology is employed for removal of from the flue gas of boilers used in power generation and industry. In general, the SCR unit is located between the furnace economizer and the air heater, and the ammonia is injected into the catalyst chamber through an ammonia injection grid. As in other SCR applications, the temperature of operation is critical. Ammonia slip is also an issue with SCR technology used in power plants. Other issues that must be considered in using SCR for control in power plants are the formation of ammonium sulfate and ammonium bisulfate due to the sulfur content of the fuel as well as the undesirable catalyst-caused formation of from the and in the flue gas. A further operational difficulty in coal-fired boilers is the binding of the catalyst by fly ash from the fuel combustion. This requires the usage of sootblowers, sonic horns, and careful design of the ductwork and catalyst materials to avoid plugging by the fly ash. SCR catalysts have a typical operational lifetime of about 16,000-40,000 hours in coal-fired power plants, depending on the flue gas composition, and up to 80,000 hours in cleaner gas- fired power plants. Poisons, sulfur compounds, and fly ash can all be removed by installing scrubbers can be installed before the SCR system to increase the life of the catalyst, though most plants' scrubbers are installed after the system. ==SCR and EPA 2010== Hino truck and its Standardized SCR Unit which combines SCR with Diesel Particulate Active Reduction (DPR). DPR is a diesel particulate filtration system with regeneration process that uses late fuel injection to control exhaust temperature to burn off soot. Diesel engines manufactured on or after January 1, 2010 are required to meet lowered NOx standards for the US market. All of the heavy-duty engine (Class 7-8 trucks) manufacturers except for Navistar International and Caterpillar continuing to manufacture engines after this date have chosen to use SCR. This includes Detroit Diesel (DD13, DD15, and DD16 models), Cummins (ISX, ISL9, and ISB6.7), Paccar, and Volvo/Mack. These engines require the periodic addition of diesel exhaust fluid (DEF, a urea solution) to enable the process. DEF is available in bottles and jugs from most truck stops, and a more recent development is bulk DEF dispensers near diesel fuel pumps. Caterpillar and Navistar had initially chosen to use enhanced exhaust gas recirculation (EEGR) to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards, but in July 2012 Navistar announced it would be pursuing SCR technology for its engines, except on the MaxxForce 15 which was to be discontinued. Caterpillar ultimately withdrew from the on-highway engine market prior to implementation of these requirements.

Originally, Frank Pepe only made two varieties of pizza: the \\"tomato pie\\" (tomatoes with grated pecorino romano cheese, garlic, oregano, and olive oil) and the other with the addition of anchovy. The piece of land which Pepe's restaurant sat on was owned by the Boccamiello family. They later made Frank Pepe leave so that they could start their own pizzeria at the establishment, which they renamed The Spot. Pepe moved his restaurant to its current location next door to The Spot in 1936. The Pepe family later bought back The Spot from the Boccamiello family in 1981 and it now serves the same menu as the newer restaurant. In the alleyway between The Spot and Pepe's, Boccamiello's nephew Bear would open clams and sell them on the half shell to passersby. Pepe's restaurant began serving littleneck clams on the half shell at the bar. It was only a matter of time before he decided to put the clams on the pizza. The white clam pie is just crust, olive oil, oregano, grated cheese, chopped garlic, and fresh littleneck clams. The restaurant will serve the pizza with or without mozzarella cheese, but they try to discourage customers from ordering it with mozzarella because they feel that it makes the pizza too heavy and rich. They are also adamant on using freshly shucked clams as opposed to canned clams; if fresh clams are not available then they will not serve the white clam pie. Three men are employed by Pepe's just for shucking the clams on location. Since its invention, the white clam pie has become the signature pizza of pizzerias in New Haven. In March, 2015 Pepe's released their plans to expand into the Boston market. On December 16, 2015 they opened their Chestnut Hill location.

The UCCJEA has since been adopted by 49 U.S. States, the District of Columbia, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Act became effective in Vermont on 7/1/2011. As of January 22, 2016, the only state that has not adopted the UCCJEA is Massachusetts. Puerto Rico has also not adopted the Act. The UCCJEA vests \\"exclusive [and] continuing jurisdiction\\" for child custody litigation in the courts of the child's \\"home state,\\" which is defined as the state where the child has lived with a parent for six consecutive months prior to the commencement of the proceeding (or since birth for children younger than six months). If the child has not lived in any state for at least six months, then a court in a state that has (1) \\"significant connections\\" with the child and at least one parent and (2) \\"substantial evidence concerning the child's care, protection, training, and personal relationships\\" may assume child-custody jurisdiction. If more than one state has \\"significant connections\\" and \\"substantial evidence...\\", the courts of those states must communicate and determine which state has the most significant connections to the child. A court which has made a child-custody determination consistent with UCCJEA has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over the determination until either (1) that court determines that neither the child, the child's parents, nor any person acting as a parent has a significant connection with the State that made the original order and that substantial evidence is no longer available in the State concerning the child's care, protection, training, and personal relationships, or (2) that court or a court of another State determines that the child, the child's parents, and any person acting as a parent do not reside in the State that initially made the child custody order. The UCCJEA replaced a previous Uniform Act, the \\"Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act\\", primarily because the old act was inconsistent with the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act when determining proper jurisdiction for initial custody determinations and because of contradictory interpretations of the PKPA. The UCCJEA corrects these problems. The UCCJEA also added uniform procedures to register and enforce child-custody orders across state lines. == Initial custody determination == To determine which state has proper jurisdiction to make an \\"initial determination\\" of child custody, the UCCJEA proceeds in the following order of priority: #The state which is the \\"home state\\" of the child, or was the child's home state within six months immediately before the commencement of child custody proceedings if the child is absent from the state, but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live in the state; #If no state has jurisdiction under #1, then jurisdiction is proper where the child and at least one parent have a significant connection with the state (other than mere presence), and substantial evidence concerning the custody determination is available in the state; #If no state has jurisdiction under #1 or #2 above, jurisdiction is proper in any state having an appropriate connection with the child. A state having jurisdiction under #1 or #2 above may decline to exercise its jurisdiction, and transfer it to another state if it is more convenient for the parties, or if one of the parties has engaged in misconduct necessitating a change. \\"Home state\\" is defined as the \\"state in which a child lived with a parent or a person acting as a parent for at least six consecutive months immediately before the commencement of a child-custody proceeding. In the case of a child less than six months of age, the term means the state in which the child lived from birth with any of the persons mentioned. A period of temporary absence of any of the mentioned persons is part of the period.\\" For example, young Chris has lived in Iowa with his mother and father for the last three years. If the mother moves to Minnesota, but Chris remains in Iowa, then Minnesota will not have jurisdiction to determine custody over Chris. Iowa is the only state that can determine custody at this point. == Exclusive, Continuing jurisdiction == Once a state court has made a custody determination, that state keeps jurisdiction over all matters concerning that child, unless: #A court of the state with jurisdiction determines that the child or the child and a parent do not have a significant connection with the state, AND evidence concerning the child's custody determination is not available in the state; OR #A court of the state with jurisdiction, or any other state, determines that the child and both parents or acting parents do not reside in the state any longer. For an example of #1, the parents divorce in Texas, and mother and children move to Mississippi. The father continues to live in Texas and the children maintain a significant connection to Texas by visiting Texas often and spending their summers there. Three years later father files suit in Texas to modify custody. The mother attempts to transfer jurisdiction to Mississippi. The UCCJEA, which was designed to prevent forum shopping, prevents her attempt by providing protection to an issuing court's jurisdiction that made an initial child custody determination unless: ...\\"or... the child's parents, and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in this state\\". For an example of #2, parents divorce in Texas, mother and children move to Mississippi, Father moves to California. Because the children and both parents no longer live in Texas, the courts of Texas will have lost their exclusive, continuing jurisdiction to modify their own custody orders. For most practical purposes, that means that jurisdiction to modify those orders will most likely not be in Texas, but, rather, in the state where the children and at least one parent have taken up residence (here, Mississippi). == Modification of custody determination == Once a custody determination has been made, a court of another state does not have authority to modify the determination, unless the state with jurisdiction determines that it does not have jurisdiction as noted above, or any state court determines that the child, parents, and any acting parents do not reside in the state which has jurisdiction. To continue with the example of an initial custody determination above, let us say that Chris' father gets custody of Chris in the Iowa courts, and the mom moves to Arkansas. If Chris spends the summer with his mom in Arkansas, his mom cannot go to the Arkansas courts and attempt to modify custody - Iowa has continuing jurisdiction. == Emergency orders == A state which does not otherwise have jurisdiction may enter a temporary emergency order, if the child is in danger and needs immediate protection. After issuing such order, the state court should determine if there is an existing custody order from another state in effect. If there is an existing order, the emergency court must allow a reasonable time period for the parties to return to the state having jurisdiction, and argue the issues to the court with jurisdiction. If there is no previous child custody order in existence, the emergency court's order will remain in effect until a determination is made in a court having \\"home state\\" jurisdiction over the child. If no determination is made, and the emergency court's state becomes the home state of the child, the emergency order becomes a final determination of custody... ==External links== *North Carolina Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act *Minnesota Bar article analyzing UCCJEA and contrasting with old act * Comparison of UCCJA and UCCJEA section-by-section * Utah Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act * Utah Uniform Interstate Family Support Act * Utah Parentage Act * Utah State Protective Orders Child custody jurisdiction and enforcement Category:1997 in American law Category:Child custody ","title":"Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act"},{"id":"2219880","text":"≈†irvintos District Municipality () is a municipality in Lithuania, it is in territory of Vilnius County and its capital is ≈†irvintos. ==Geography== ≈†irvinta River The territory of the municipality is 906 km¬≤. ≈†irvintos City, 5 towns ‚Äì Bagaslavi≈°kis, ƒåiobi≈°kis, Gelvonai, Kernavƒó, Musninkai and 485 villages are in the municipality.

Negative refraction can be obtained by using a metamaterial which has been designed to achieve a negative value for (electric) permittivity (Œµ) and (magnetic) permeability (Œº); in such cases the material can be assigned a negative refractive index. Such materials are sometimes called \\"double negative\\" materials. Negative refraction occurs at interfaces between materials at which one has an ordinary positive phase velocity (i.e., a positive refractive index), and the other has the more exotic negative phase velocity (a negative refractive index). ==Negative phase velocity== Negative phase velocity (NPV) is a property of light propagation in a medium. There are different definitions of NPV; the most common is Victor Veselago's original proposal of opposition of the wave vector and (Abraham) the Poynting vector. Other definitions include the opposition of wave vector to group velocity, and energy to velocity. \\"Phase velocity\\" is used conventionally,as phase velocity has the same sign as the wave vector. A typical criterion used to determine Veselago's NPV is that the dot product of the Poynting vector and wave vector is negative (i.e., that \\\\scriptstyle\\\\vec{P}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{k}<0), but this definition is not covariant. While this restriction is not practically significant, the criterion has been generalized into a covariant form. Veselago NPV media are also called \\"left- handed (meta)materials\\", as the components of plane waves passing through (electric field, magnetic field, and wave vector) follow the left-hand rule instead of the right-hand rule. The terms \\"left-handed\\" and \\"right-handed\\" are generally avoided as they are also used to refer to chiral media. == Negative refractive index == A comparison of refraction in a left-handed metamaterial to that in a normal material Video representing negative refraction of light at uniform planar interface. One can choose to avoid directly considering the Poynting vector and wave vector of a propagating light field, and instead directly consider the response of the materials. Assuming the material is achiral, one can consider what values of permittivity (Œµ) and permeability (¬µ) result in negative phase velocity (NPV). Since both Œµ and ¬µ are generally complex, their imaginary parts do not have to be negative for a passive (i.e. lossy) material to display negative refraction. In these materials, the criterion for negative phase velocity is derived by Depine and Lakhtakia to be : \\\\epsilon_r\\\\mu+ \\\\mu_r \\\\epsilon < 0, where \\\\epsilon_r, \\\\mu_r are the real valued parts of Œµ and ¬µ, respectively. For active materials, the criterion is different. NPV occurrence does not necessarily imply negative refraction (negative refractive index). Typically, the refractive index n is determined using : n =\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon\\\\mu}, where by convention the positive square root is chosen for n. However, in NPV materials, the negative square root is chosen to mimic the fact that the wave vector and phase velocity are also reversed. The refractive index is a derived quantity that describes how the wavevector is related to the optical frequency and propagation direction of the light; thus, the sign of n must be chosen to match the physical situation. === In chiral materials === The refractive index n also depends on the chirality parameter \\\\kappa, resulting in distinct values for left and right circularly polarized waves, given by :n = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_r\\\\mu_r} \\\\pm \\\\kappa. A negative refractive index occurs for one polarization if \\\\kappa > \\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_r\\\\mu_r}; in this case, \\\\epsilon_r and/or \\\\mu_r do not need to be negative. A negative refractive index due to chirality was predicted by Pendry and Tretyakov et al., and first observed simultaneously and independently by Plum et al. and Zhang et al. in 2009. ==Refraction== The consequence of negative refraction is light rays are refracted on the same side of the normal on entering the material, as indicated in the diagram, and by a general form of Snell's law. ==ReferencesSee also== *Acoustic metamaterials *Metamaterial *Negative index metamaterials *Metamaterial antennas *Multiple-prism dispersion theory *N-slit interferometric equation *Perfect lens *Photonic metamaterials *Photonic crystal *Seismic metamaterials *Split-ring resonator *Tunable metamaterials ===Electromagnetic interactions=== *Bloch wave *Casimir effect *Dielectric *Electromagnetism *EM radiation *Electron mobility *Permeability (electromagnetism)* *Permittivity* *Wavenumber *Photo-Dember *Impedance Category:Optics Category:Concepts in physics Category:Metamaterials Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Negative concepts ","title":"Negative refraction"},{"id":"2219893","text":"Lakeland Bus Lines, Inc is a privately chartered and apportioned bus company headquartered in Dover, New Jersey.

Until 2020, he was CEO of International Airlines Group, and had previously been CEO of Aer Lingus and British Airways. ==Early life== Walsh was born in Dublin, Ireland. He attended his local secondary school Ardscoil R√≠s. At age 17 he became a pilot at Irish flag carrier Aer Lingus, joining as a cadet in 1979. He acquired a Master's degree in management and business administration from Trinity College, Dublin during his pilot years, while advancing to become a Boeing 737 captain.AW&ST;, 24 March 2014, p. 46 He joined company management in various positions including chief executive of then company subsidiary, Futura from 1998 to 2000. He returned to Aer Lingus in 2000 as Chief Operating Officer (COO). ==Career== In October 2001, Walsh was elevated from COO to CEO of Aer Lingus, succeeding Michael Foley who had resigned following a harassment complaint. The carrier was in financial difficulty. Walsh eliminated 2,000 staff positions and reconfigured Aer Lingus as a low-cost airline. He also withdrew various services like short-haul Business Class and restricted the airline's frequent-flyer programme, TAB. The company operating profits rebounded, but the cost of the write-offs and redundancies meant that net profitability was not as quick to recover. Not all of Walsh's reforms were successful, such as the outsourcing of aircraft cleaning. The contracting had not been agreed with Aer Lingus unions which led to large payments to the private contractor while Aer Lingus employees did the cleaning work. A three-day lock-out occurred in 2002 during the peak of the cutbacks. The management team suggested to the principal shareholder, the Irish Government, a float of Aer Lingus on the stock market. Stock floats are often rewarding to top management and this was opposed by the unions who feared a privatised Aer Lingus would impose even tougher working conditions. The Government eventually turned down the float and Walsh resigned from the company in January 2005. The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern subsequently described Walsh's offer of an MBO as \\"a time when management wanted to steal the assets for themselves through a management buy out, shafting staff interests\\". Dermot Mannion, formerly of Emirates, succeeded Walsh as Aer Lingus chief executive officer in August 2005. Before joining British Airways, he briefly worked at the top of Virgin Atlantic but left after a short while due to a falling out with his boss. After he left, he went to British Airways, where he would replace Rod Eddington at the end of his contract. Walsh was hired in May 2005, with a six-month shadowing period to get to know the business before the departure of Eddington on October 2005. Willie Walsh became CEO of British Airways in October 2005. The major challenges for the airline industry were exacerbated by various natural events such as snow, fog and volcanic ash. He described the closure of European airspace in April 2010 over worries about the ash plume from an erupting Icelandic volcano as a \\"gross over-reaction to a very minor risk\\". Walsh oversaw the merger of British Airways and Iberia forming a new holding company International Airlines Group (IAG) in January 2011. He also created a Joint Business Agreement with Iberia and American Airlines, meaning the three airlines now market and sell each other's seats and share revenue on trans-Atlantic routes. On 24 January 2011, Willie Walsh became chief executive of IAG, which is the parent company of BA and Iberia. Both airlines are members of the Oneworld alliance.

It has been the training ground of the London Broncos rugby league club since 2014; the club's under-19 team also play their fixtures there. Before being demolished the stadium was recorded as having a final capacity of 6,023. The stadium was famous for its slope from the North to South end. It was also used for Arsenal reserve games until 2012. Barnet played their final game at the stadium on 20 April 2013 with a 1-0 win over Wycombe Wanderers, with Jake Hyde scoring the winner in the 81st minute, and Graham Stack saving a 94th-minute penalty to secure the victory in front of a sell-out crowd of 6,001. Barnet moved out of the ground and started their 2013-14 season campaign at The Hive Stadium in Edgware. Demolition of Underhill began in January 2018. ==History== The ground was opened in September 1907 with a match against Crystal Palace which the home side won 1‚Äì0. At the time, there were a number of amateur clubs playing in Barnet. When opened, the ground was home to Barnet Alston. Alston merged with Avenue FC (who were known as Barnet FC) in 1912 to become Barnet & Alston FC. After the First World War, the club reverted to the name Barnet FC, which continues today. Barnet vs. Arsenal playing at the Underhill Stadium To celebrate the 100th year of football at the stadium, the two sides met again in the 2007-08 Pre-Season. Palace won this match 3‚Äì2. From the 2013‚Äì14 season Barnet will play their home games at The Hive Stadium. In 2014, the Super League rugby league team, London Broncos, will be training at Underhill and their gym and offices will be based there. Their Under-19s side also played matches at the stadium. Edgware Town played their opening games of the 2014‚Äì15 Spartan South Midlands League season at Underhill, while their Silver Jubilee Park ground was refurbished. In June 2015 the site was sold to the Education Funding Agency. Demolition work began in January 2018 to facilitate the building the new Ark Pioneer Academy, which is scheduled to open in September 2019. ==Development== Underhill Stadium, South Stand At Night Barnet opened the 1,016 seater South Stand in 2008 to replace the temporary structure which had stood in its place for over ten years. The stand was first used for the FA Cup victory over Swindon Town in January 2008, just a matter of weeks after work had started. The Bees have also erected a temporary covered structure in the North East corner of the ground with seated capacity of 240. This was built so away supporters could have the choice between sitting or standing as the stand is adjacent to the away terraced section. These improvements finally brought Underhill to Football League standards and the capacity was increased to 5,568. The club have announced that work is underway in order to erect four new corner floodlights, which will be 25 metres high and have a 500 Lux value as opposed to the current 350. The eight old pylons dating from 1962 have been removed. Work was completed prior to the opening pre-season game of the 2010-2011 season against Arsenal and the stadium capacity was again increased to 6,023 as a result. ==Stands== Underhill had seven stands. On the bottom end of the ground was the South Stand which was opened recently. The East Terrace was split into three sections, with the home fans allocated the two southernmost parts and the remaining section allocated to away supporters. Adjacent to the East Terrace stood the North East Family Stand with covered seating for away supporters. The tiny North Terrace backed onto Westcombe Drive, where residents could watch the action. The Main Stand was flanked by two smaller stands, the North West Terrace and Family Stand. After a matchday incident on the East Terrace, the club acted to increase the distance between home and away supporters. Away fans have been segregated further towards the north of the terrace. When away support is expected to number over 500, the whole of the North-East section is opened, and the Central section is closed to enforce the new segregation arrangements. The situation further highlights the inadequacy of Underhill as a Football League stadium, even though it now meets league criteria, and the club continues to search for a new home. In the South West Corner of the ground stands the Durham Suite, named after Bees midfielder Kevin Durham who died in 1991. Although not part of the ground, the Pavilion behind the South Stand is owned by the club and acts as the social club for many fans. Away fans are not allowed into the Pavilion. ==Record attendance== The record attendance at Underhill was 11,026 against Wycombe Wanderers on 23 February 1952 for an Amateur cup tie. ==References *Barnet's official site *Stadium images Category:Barnet F.C.

In 1905, the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were created from the heavily populated areas of the Northwest Territories. The members of the NWT Liberal Party joined the Alberta Liberal Party or the Saskatchewan Liberal Party. With almost no voting population in the remaining parts of the Northwest Territories, its political parties disbanded when the Government of Canada returned to its former policy of appointing members of the Territories' legislative assembly The assembly went back to the consensus model of government. The consensus model of government that had been used prior to the election of 1898 had its influences in the party system: Conservative leader and Government Leader Frederick W. A. G. Haultain appointed two Liberals to his cabinet and one Conservative, even though they formed the opposition, from 1898 to 1905. This led Conservatives to accuse the government of being a \\"grit hive\\", after the election of 1902. To appease party supporters, Haultain appointed one Liberal and two Conservatives to the cabinet. The Calgary Herald attacked the Territorial Liberals in October 1902, after they held a convention in which they failed to adopt policies towards the creation of a provincial government. This set off a bitter editorial war against the Liberal and Conservative media. Robert Brett was the Leader of the party from the beginning until, he made a surprise move to drop out of the race just days before the election of 1902. Donald H. McDonald, filled his place, and became leader of the opposition, until the provinces were created in 1905. Leaders of the Party *Robert Brett (1897‚Äì1902) *Donald H. McDonald (1902‚Äì1905) ==Modern era== Under the current consensus government, political parties are not currently recognized in Northwest Territories law, but a few scattered candidates have run in recent elections claiming to represent the Liberal party. The most notable of which is Lynda Sorenson, Northwest Territories MLA from 1979 - 1983. There are plans to reestablish a Northwest Territories Liberal Party in time for elections in 2015. ==See also== *Northwest Territories Liberal-Conservative Party *List of Northwest Territories political parties *List of Northwest Territories general elections ==References *Personnel of the Northwest Territories Assembly 1888 - 1905 *Calgary Herald attacks the Liberals October 8, 1902 Liberal Category:Liberal parties in Canada Category:Political parties established in 1898 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1905 Category:Defunct political parties in Canada Category:1898 establishments in the Northwest Territories Category:1905 disestablishments in the Northwest Territories ","title":"Northwest Territories Liberal Party"},{"id":"2219957","text":"Zinon Michailidis () was a Greek shooter.

It premiered on July 24, 2000 on NBC, before being aired intermittently on NBC through August 2001. The series also began airing on PAX TV in August 2000, ultimately moving to PAX TV after the series was dropped by NBC. It was produced in-house by Paxson Entertainment, in association with Lionsgate Television and CTV. It was cancelled in 2002 after two seasons. == Plot == The series focuses on the search for explanations of, and evidence for, seemingly miraculous phenomena. This search is carried out by the protagonist Declan Dunn (Adrian Pasdar). Declan is a professor of anthropology at the Northern University of Oregon and is often compared with Indiana Jones due to his energetic enthusiasm for solving a mystery. His passion for miraculous events has its roots in a self- experienced mischance of being caught in an avalanche and getting out alive. He considers this to be miraculous and attributes it as the turning point in his life. In several episodes he makes references to this event and the impact it had on his life. Always ready to help out with the research, though sometimes they appear slightly reluctant, are Declan's close friends Dr. Peggy Fowler (Rae Dawn Chong), a psychiatrist at a nearby hospital, and Miranda Feigelsteen (Alisen Down), a physics graduate student and Declan's research assistant. Peggy is the most levelheaded of the three and is generally the one presenting the mundane alternatives to Declan's theories. Her so-called \\"rational explanations\\" often provide no explanation whatsoever, e.g. \\"It was just a freak occurrence\\". Often being assigned to carry out tests of various substances, or operating a range of instruments, is Miranda. She is the second skeptic besides Peggy, with a somber and introvert personality, sometimes with moments of joking banter or sarcastic comments. In the episodes \\"The Ties That Bind\\" (1.08) and \\"Free Spirit\\" (2.14) another, more open side of her is shown before her social peers, if only temporarily. Being the quiet personality, Miranda is sometimes somewhat of a mystery even to her best friends. In many cases the episodes conclude with a rational explanation being seemingly validated, then disproven at the last minute; thus leaving the question of paranormal activity open once more. == Cast == right * Adrian Pasdar as Declan Dunn, the main character of the series. Declan is a Professor of Anthropology at Northern University in Oregon. While skiing, he was caught up in an avalanche. He was left for dead, but miraculously made it out alive. Ever since this incident, Declan has dedicated a large part of his free time to investigating miracles that occur around or to certain individuals in the hopes that it will bring some perspective to the miracle that saved his life. He is assisted in his investigations by his close friends Dr. Peggy Fowler, a psychiatrist, and Miranda Feigelsteen, Declan's assistant. Both of these women are strong skeptics and, although they rarely turn down helping Declan, they always attempt to use science to explain the events that surround the miraculous phenomena. Declan has a wry sense of humor that he uses to make jokes even in the face of strange phenomena. * Rae Dawn Chong as Dr. Peggy Fowler, a smart and open psychiatrist who helps victims of strange and unusual events cope with their feelings. Although having a relatively cheerful personality, Peggy is still haunted by her husbands' death and because of this event, no longer believes in miracles but in people. Despite her beliefs, she nearly always helps Declan whenever he requests it, her connections at the hospital being a great help to Declan and his investigations. She often attempts to disprove Declan's theories and is confused and elated when she cannot explain the miracles she witnesses. *Alisen Down as Miranda Feigelsteen, assistant to Declan and physics graduate student, Miranda is sarcastic, intelligent and slightly unimpressed. Like her friend Peggy, Miranda has little belief in miracles and nearly always has a contrary position to Declan's theories. Despite this, Miranda is very loyal to Declan and always has time to listen to him and his theories. Their relationship is very special, Declan seemingly being the only one to bring Miranda out of her shell. ==Production== Mysterious Ways was created by Peter O'Fallon, who wanted a science-fiction drama that was family-friendly and allowed him to explore humanistic themes. U2's song of the same name inspired the series' title. For O'Fallon, the series' move from NBC to PAX TV was a good development, since it allowed for total creative freedom. == Episodes  Season 1 (2000‚Äì01) = Season 2 (2001‚Äì02) = Broadcast == The show first eight episodes aired in the United States on NBC starting July 2000. The show returned in January 2001 and later on July of the same year, before being pulled in August due to poor ratings. Meanwhile, PAX TV, a channel NBC had a 32% interest in, began broadcasting the show in August 2000, airing through the summer months. PAX would become the show's home for the rest of its run, until September 2002. The series had seen success internationally, even after its cancellation. It currently airs in syndication on VisionTV in Canada. == References  External links == * * * Mysterious Ways at EPisodeWorld Category:2000s American drama television series Category:2000s Canadian drama television series Category:2000s American science fiction television series Category:2000s Canadian science fiction television series Category:CTV Television Network original programming Category:PAX TV original programming Category:Television series by Lionsgate Television Category:2000 American television series debuts Category:2000 Canadian television series debuts Category:2002 American television series endings Category:2002 Canadian television series endings Category:Television series produced in Vancouver Category:English-language television shows ","title":"Mysterious Ways (TV series)"},{"id":"2219962","text":"Moustakopoulos () was a Greek shooter.

H. Bartlett of the Four Courts and Whitworth Bridge (left middle ground) Father Mathew Bridge () is a road bridge spanning the River Liffey in Dublin, Ireland and joining Merchants Quay to Church Street and the north quays. It is approximately on the site of the original, and for many years only, Bridge of Dublin, dating back to the 11th century. ==History== The site of the bridge is understood to be close to the ancient \\"Ford of the Hurdles\\", which was the original crossing point on the Liffey and gives its name (in Irish) to the city of Dublin (). At the turn of the first millennium (c. 1014), the first recorded Dublin Liffey bridge was built at this point. Possibly known as the Bridge of Dubhghall, this basic wooden structure was maintained and rebuilt over several centuries (from early Medieval to Viking to Norman times). These rebuilds included a Norman bridge (sanctioned by King John) in the early 13th century. This collapsed however in the late 14th century and in 1428, the Dominicans of Ostmantown Friary built the first masonry bridge in Dublin on the same spot. Known as Dublin Bridge, Old Bridge, or simply The Bridge, this four arch structure had towers at either end, and shops, housing, an inn and a chapel were built on its supports. In 1312 Geoffrey de Morton, Mayor of Dublin 1302‚Äì3, was reprimanded for building a house without permission on the bridge. It was he who began building the towers, which were completed by his son-in- law John de Grauntsete, who later built St. Mary's Chapel on the Bridge. For much of its 390-year life span, The Bridge carried all pedestrian, livestock and horse-drawn traffic across the river, and (as late as 1762) its tolls and chapel were still in use. At the beginning of the 19th century, Dublin Bridge was replaced by a three-span, elliptical arch stone bridge. Designed by George Knowles (who also designed O'Donovan Rossa Bridge and Lucan Bridge), the bridge was opened in 1818 as Whitworth Bridge, being named for Charles Whitworth, 1st Earl Whitworth, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. As with many other Dublin bridges (particularly those named for British peers), the bridge was renamed following the establishment of the Irish Free State as Dublin Bridge in the 1920s. In line with another, later, Dublin tradition of naming bridges for temperance campaigners, the bridge was renamed again in 1938 for Father Theobald Mathew (the Apostle of Temperance) who was born at Thomastown near Golden, County Tipperary. ==References== Category:Bridges in Dublin (city) Category:Bridges completed in 1428 Category:Bridges completed in 1818 Category:Former toll bridges ","title":"Father Mathew Bridge"},{"id":"2219977","text":"The Philosophical Research Society (PRS) is an American nonprofit organization founded in 1934, by Manly Palmer Hall, to promote the study of the world's wisdom literature.

Los Feliz headquarters in 2015 Its current president is Greg Salyer, Ph.D., a graduate of Emory University's Graduate Institute of the Liberal Arts. Following Mr. Hall's death in 1990, Obadiah Harris, Ph.D. served as the second president and in 2001 opened the University of Philosophical Research, an accredited online university offering graduate programs in consciousness studies and transformational psychology and an undergraduate degree in liberal studies. PRS closed this university in 2019 in favor of offering non-degree courses and certificates with lower costs and greater access to seekers of wisdom. PRS maintains a research library of over 50,000 volumes, and also sells and publishes metaphysical and esoteric books, mostly those authored by Hall. In 2018 PRS opened the Hansell Gallery to exhibit works of art that express the concept of wisdom in all of its forms. PRS offers a variety of events and lectures throughout the year that incorporate art, cultural studies, literature, philosophy, mythology, among others disciplines.

It originated at the Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana and is now served in many other pizza restaurants in the area, most notably Sally's Apizza and Modern Apizza. This geographically limited pizza style has been favorably referenced by national critics. Sally's is ranked six, while Pepe's is ranked twelve, out of 25 restaurants nationally. ==Characteristics== In a New Haven-style pizzeria, a \\"plain\\" pizza is a crust, oregano, and tomato sauce with a little bit of grated pecorino romano cheese. A \\"plain\\" New Haven-style pizza may also be called a \\"tomato pie\\". Mozzarella is considered to be a topping; a customer who wants it must ask for it. Pepe invented the \\"white clam pie\\". Pepe's restaurant served littleneck clams on the half shell at the bar, which he later added to the pizza. The white clam pie is a crust, olive oil, oregano, grated cheese, chopped garlic, and fresh littleneck clams. What makes New Haven-style pizza distinct is its thin, oblong crust, characteristic charring, chewy texture, and limited use of melting cheeses. It tends to be drier and thinner than, but closely related to, traditional New York-style pizza. Both styles in turn are close descendants of the original Neapolitan style. ==Cooking and serving methods== New Haven-style pizza is traditionally baked in a coal-fired oven at extremely hot temperatures above . It is sold whole rather than by the slice. ==Availability== Although most commonly available in the New Haven area, New Haven-style pizza has begun to spread to other parts of the United States. It has been available in the Italian-American areas of Bridgeport, and other shoreline communities for many years; Frank Pepe‚Äôs also claims a location in the Italian-heavy New York area (Yonkers). New Haven- style has penetrated areas typically not known for large Italian-American populations, including towns in northern and central Connecticut, as well as other cities across the United States. ==See also== * ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Shelton, Jim (July 21, 2002). \\"You say Sally's, I say Pepe's.\\" New Haven Register.

Its holdings are largely devoted to relics of the Silla kingdom, of which Gyeongju was the capital. The museum is located immediately adjacent to the royal tomb complex, in an area which also includes the Gyerim forest, Cheomseongdae observatory, Banwolseong palace, and Anapji Pond. ==History== The museum was first founded in 1945 as the Gyeongju Branch of National Museum of Korea.Gyeongju National Museum History The main building of the museum was built in 1968. The museum was upgraded as \\"Gyeongju National Museum\\" in 1975 and has been under expansion since then. ==Collections== There are a number of national museums in key locations across Korea, but the collection of this museum is especially important because it allows the general public, archaeologists, and historians to understand the rise of civilization in southeast Korea. The museum contains important items of national cultural heritage. They include the Emille Bell, which is said to ring with the sound of a child who was sacrificed for its casting. There are several Silla crowns in the museum's collection. The museum also holds many artifacts excavated from Anapji Pond and artifacts excavated from the Hwangnyongsa Temple site. Many holdings are displayed outdoors, a common practice in Korean museums. The volume of archaeological and historical artifacts in the collection of the Gyeongju National Museum is so large that most of the objects cannot be displayed and are thus stored out of the view of the general public. The Gyeongju National Museum has maintained an archaeological research department for decades, and staff there have conducted numerous field surveys and excavations in North Gyeongsang Province. This role has lessened with the onset of government-funded 'buried cultural heritage research centres' (ko:Îß§Ïû•Î¨∏ÌôîÏû¨Ï°∞ÏÇ¨Ïó∞Íµ¨ÏÜå) across Korea since the mid-1990s. However, the role of the museum as a centre of cultural heritage conservation was enhanced when the Korean government built a large warehouse on the museum site in the early 2000s to house the mountains of archaeological material unearthed continuously from Gyeongju and across North Gyeongsang Province. ==Gallery== Image:BellofKingSeongdeok.jpgEmille Bell Image:Korea- Gyeongju.National.Museum-09.jpg Image:Korea-Gyeongju.National.Museum-14.jpg Image:Bangudae Petroglyphs.jpgBangudae Petroglyphs Image:Korea- Gyeongju.National.Museum-15.jpg Image:Ornamented_Sword_from_Gyerim- ro,_Gyeongju.jpgOrnamented Sword from Gyerim-ro, Gyeongju File:Korea- Gyeongju.National.Museum-12.jpg File:Group of gilt-bronze Buddhist plaques from Anapji.jpg File:Constantin6.jpg Image:Silla gold 4.jpg Image:Silla gold 5.jpg File:GyeongjuHorseBuckles.jpg File:GyeongjuGoldEarrings.jpg File:Bifyu 7.jpg File:Standing_Gilt- bronze_Bhaisajyaguru_Buddha_of_Baengnyulsa_Temple(Î∞±Î•†ÏÇ¨_Í∏àÎèôÏïΩÏÇ¨Ïó¨ÎûòÏûÖÏÉÅ).jpg File:Gyeongju National Museum -4.JPG File:Gold crown from Cheonmachong.jpg File:Silla Kingdom-Golden hat at Cheonmachong in Gyeongju, Korea.jpg Image:Í∏àÍ¥ÄÏ¥ù Í∏àÏ†ú ÌóàÎ¶¨Îù†.jpg File:Wise Man Figurine, Gyeongju Museum.jpgWise Man Figurine File:Ancient Korean jugs.JPGAncient Korean jugs File:GyeongjuStatue.jpg File:Long-necked jar with figurines (ÌÜ†Ïö∞Ïû•Ïãù Ïû•Í≤ΩÌò∏) 03.jpg File:Long-necked jar.Silla.

This form of Welsh developed from Old Welsh. ==Literature and history== Middle Welsh is the language of nearly all surviving early manuscripts of the Mabinogion, although the tales themselves are certainly much older. It is also the language of most of the manuscripts of Welsh law. Middle Welsh is reasonably intelligible, albeit with some work, to a modern-day Welsh speaker. ==Phonology== The phonology of Middle Welsh is quite similar to that of modern Welsh, with only a few differences. The letter u, which today represents in North Western Welsh dialects and in South Welsh and North East Welsh dialects, represented the close central rounded vowel in Middle Welsh. The diphthong aw is found in unstressed final syllables in Middle Welsh, while in Modern Welsh it has become o (e.g. Middle Welsh = Modern Welsh \\"horseman\\"). Similarly, the Middle Welsh diphthongs ei and eu have become ai and au in final syllables, e. g. Middle Welsh = modern \\"seven\\", Middle Welsh = modern \\"sun\\". ==Orthography== The orthography of Middle Welsh was not standardised, and there is great variation between manuscripts in how certain sounds are spelled. Some generalisations of differences between Middle Welsh spelling and Modern Welsh spelling can be made. For example, the possessive adjectives \\"his, her\\", \\"their\\" and the preposition \\"to\\" are very commonly spelled in Middle Welsh, and are thus spelt the same as the definite article and the indirect relative particle . A phrase such as is therefore ambiguous in Middle Welsh between the meaning \\"the cat\\" (spelt the same in Modern Welsh), the meaning \\"his cat\\" (modern ), and the meaning \\"to a cat\\" (modern ). The voiced stop consonants are represented by the letters t c at the end of a word, e.g. \\"protection\\" (modern ), \\"running\\" (modern ). The sound is very often spelled k before the vowels e i y (in Modern Welsh, it is always spelt c, e.g. Middle Welsh = modern \\"third cousin\\"). The sound is usually spelt u or v (these are interchangeable as in Latin MSS), except at the end of a word, where it is spelt f (in Modern Welsh, it is always spelt f, e.g. Middle Welsh = modern \\"apple tree\\"). The sound is usually spelt d (in Modern Welsh, it is spelt dd, e.g. Middle Welsh = modern \\"day\\"). The sound is spelt r and is thus not distinguished from (in Modern Welsh, they are distinguished as rh and r respectively, e.g. Middle Welsh \\"running\\" vs. modern ). ==Grammar== {  +Present indicative active - !width=\\"100pt\\" !width=\\"100pt\\"caru, \\"to love\\" !width=\\"100pt\\"bot, \\"to be\\" - I   -  Thou   - He, she, it   - We   - You (pl.)   - They   } ===Morphology=== Middle Welsh is closer to the other medieval Celtic languages, e.g. Old Irish, in its morphology. For example, the endings -w≈∑s, -ws, -es and -as are used for 3rd person singular of the past tense in Middle Welsh as well as the form -odd. In the same person and tense exists the form kigleu from the verb clywed 'to hear (etc.)', which is very antiquated and corresponds to the Old Irish c√∫ala from the verb ro-cluinethar 'he/she heard'. Middle Welsh also has more separate plural forms of adjectives that do not appear in modern Welsh, e.g. cochion 'red; rouges'. The plural termination -awr for nouns is very common in Middle Welsh, but has been replaced by -au. ==Syntax== As in modern written Welsh, the VSO word order (Gwelodd y brenin gastell: \\"Saw the king a castle\\") is not used exclusively in Middle Welsh, but irregular and mixed orders are also used: Y brenin a welodd gastell: (\\"[It was] the king that saw a castle\\"). The suggestion is that the mixed order places emphasis on the subject, and is often used in Welsh today to emphasise something. The difference between the two is that a negative particle (ni/na) precedes the subject in the mixed order (thus Ni brenin a welodd gastell would mean \\"It was not the king that saw the castle\\", but precedes the verb in the irregular order (thus Brenin ni welodd gastell = \\"The king did not see a castle\\"). ==See also== *Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru, the standard historical Welsh dictionary *Medieval Welsh literature, Book of Llandaff, Mabinogion, Welsh law *Welsh orthography ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Evans, D.

Along with his long- term tag team partner, Blackjack Mulligan, Lanza was one-half of The Blackjacks: \\"black cowboy hat-wearing, cowboy boot-stomping, rugged hombres who drew money wherever they went\\". From the 1960s to 1980s, Lanza wrestled for promotions such as the American Wrestling Association, World Wrestling Association, and the World Wide Wrestling Federation, winning the AWA World Tag Team Championship, WWA World Tag Team Championship, and WWWF World Tag Team Championship alongside Mulligan. He is a member of the WWE Hall of Fame and the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame. == Professional wrestling career  Early career (1961‚Äì1962) === Originating from Minneapolis, Minnesota, Lanza was trained by local promoter Verne Gagne. He began his career in late-1961, wrestling a handful of matches for the Birmingham, Alabama-based NWA Mid-America promotion as \\"Joe Lanza\\". In 1962, he briefly held the promotion's NWA Southern Junior Heavyweight Championship. === St. Louis Wrestling Club (1962‚Äì1963, 1966‚Äì1978) === Lanza wrestled sporadically for the St. Louis Wrestling Club from 1962 to 1963, then again from 1966 to 1978. In February 1969, Lanza wrestled former NWA World Heavyweight Champion Gene Kiniski to a 60 minute draw, establishing him as an \\"instant contender\\". === American Wrestling Association (1962‚Äì1979) === In mid-1962, Lanza returned to Minnesota, where he joined Gagne's American Wrestling Association as Jack Lanza. He teamed with Bobby Duncum and was managed by Bobby Heenan. During his time in the company, his gimmick was that of a Western cowboy. The duo won the AWA World Tag Team Championship on July 23, 1976. In the 1970s, Lanza and Mulligan teamed up to form The Blackjacks. Lanza was a main-eventer when the duo began teaming together. They were managed by Bobby Heenan. === Mid- Atlantic Championship Wrestling (1963) === In 1963, Lanza joined the Charlotte, North Carolina-based Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling promotion, wrestling as \\"Jack Lanza\\". He left the promotion the following year. === World Wrestling Association (1967‚Äì1972) === Lanza wrestled for the Indianapolis, Indiana-based World Wrestling Association from 1967 to 1972. Accompanied by Bobby Heenan, he defeated Wilbur Snyder for the WWA World Heavyweight Championship in September 1967. His reign lasted until August 1969, when he was defeated by Dick the Bruiser. In 1971, The Blackjacks began wrestling in the WWA. In November 1971, they defeated Paul Christy and Wilbur Snyder for the WWA World Tag Team Championship. Their reign lasted until September 1972, when they lost to The Crusher and Dick the Bruiser. === World Wide Wrestling Federation (1973, 1975) === Lanza debuted in the World Wide Wrestling Federation in mid-1973 as \\"Blackjack Lanza\\". His regular opponents included Andr√© the Giant, Chief Jay Strongbow, and Dean Ho. He left the promotion in December 1973. In 1975, they joined the WWWF. On August 26, 1975, The Blackjacks defeated Dominic DeNucci and Pat Barrett for the WWWF World Tag Team Championship. The match was a two-out-of-three falls match, and the Blackjacks won the match by winning the first and third falls. As part of his tenure in WWWF, Vince McMahon promised Lanza that he would receive one World singles title shot a month. === NWA Big Time Wrestling (1974‚Äì1975) === In January 1974, The Blackjacks joined the Dallas, Texas-based NWA Big Time Wrestling promotion. Later that month, they were named the NWA American Tag Team Champions. Their reign lasted until July 1974, when they were defeated by Ken Patera and Tex McKenzie. In December 1974, he won the vacant NWA American Heavyweight Championship. He lost the championship to Fritz Von Erich later that month. === Georgia Championship Wrestling (1979) === In 1979, Lanza wrestled for Georgia Championship Wrestling. He defeated Bob Armstrong for the NWA Georgia Television Championship in April, holding the championship until August 1979, when he was defeated by Ray Candy. === Late career (1979‚Äì1985) === Lanza retired in 1985. === Retirement (1985‚Äìpresent) === After retiring, Lanza worked for the World Wrestling Federation as a road agent and producer. In 2004, Lanza inducted his longtime manager Bobby Heenan into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2004.

In this approximation, terms in a Hamiltonian which oscillate rapidly are neglected. This is a valid approximation when the applied electromagnetic radiation is near resonance with an atomic transition, and the intensity is low. Explicitly, terms in the Hamiltonians which oscillate with frequencies \\\\omega_L+\\\\omega_0 are neglected, while terms which oscillate with frequencies \\\\omega_L-\\\\omega_0 are kept, where \\\\omega_L is the light frequency and \\\\omega_0 is a transition frequency. The name of the approximation stems from the form of the Hamiltonian in the interaction picture, as shown below. By switching to this picture the evolution of an atom due to the corresponding atomic Hamiltonian is absorbed into the system ket, leaving only the evolution due to the interaction of the atom with the light field to consider. It is in this picture that the rapidly oscillating terms mentioned previously can be neglected. Since in some sense the interaction picture can be thought of as rotating with the system ket only that part of the electromagnetic wave that approximately co-rotates is kept; the counter- rotating component is discarded. == Mathematical formulation == For simplicity consider a two-level atomic system with ground and excited states \\\\text{g}\\\\rangle and \\\\text{e}\\\\rangle, respectively (using the Dirac bracket notation). Let the energy difference between the states be \\\\hbar\\\\omega_0 so that \\\\omega_0 is the transition frequency of the system. Then the unperturbed Hamiltonian of the atom can be written as : H_0=\\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\omega_0}{2}\\\\text{e}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{e}-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\omega_0}{2}\\\\text{g}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{g}. Suppose the atom experiences an external classical electric field of frequency \\\\omega_L, given by \\\\vec{E}(t) = \\\\vec{E}_0 e^{-i\\\\omega_Lt} +\\\\vec{E}_0^* e^{i\\\\omega_Lt}, e.g. a plane wave propagating in space. Then under the dipole approximation the interaction Hamiltonian between the atom and the electric field can be expressed as : H_1=-\\\\vec{d}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{E}, where \\\\vec{d} is the dipole moment operator of the atom. The total Hamiltonian for the atom-light system is therefore H=H_0+H_1. The atom does not have a dipole moment when it is in an energy eigenstate, so \\\\langle\\\\text{e}\\\\vec{d}\\\\text{e}\\\\rangle=\\\\langle\\\\text{g}\\\\vec{d}\\\\text{g}\\\\rangle=0. This means that defining \\\\vec{d}_{\\\\text{eg}}:=\\\\langle\\\\text{e}\\\\vec{d}\\\\text{g}\\\\rangle allows the dipole operator to be written as : \\\\vec{d}=\\\\vec{d}_{\\\\text{eg}}\\\\text{e}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{g}+\\\\vec{d}_{\\\\text{eg}}^*\\\\text{g}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{e} (with ^* denoting the complex conjugate). The interaction Hamiltonian can then be shown to be (see the Derivation section below) : H_1 = -\\\\hbar\\\\left(\\\\Omega e^{-i\\\\omega_Lt}+\\\\tilde{\\\\Omega}e^{i\\\\omega_Lt}\\\\right)\\\\text{e}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{g} -\\\\hbar\\\\left(\\\\tilde{\\\\Omega}^*e^{-i\\\\omega_Lt}+\\\\Omega^*e^{i\\\\omega_Lt}\\\\right)\\\\text{g}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{e} where \\\\Omega=\\\\hbar^{-1}\\\\vec{d}_\\\\text{eg}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{E}_0 is the Rabi frequency and \\\\tilde{\\\\Omega}:=\\\\hbar^{-1}\\\\vec{d}_\\\\text{eg}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{E}_0^* is the counter-rotating frequency. To see why the \\\\tilde{\\\\Omega} terms are called \`counter-rotating' consider a unitary transformation to the interaction or Dirac picture where the transformed Hamiltonian H_{1,I} is given by : H_{1,I}=-\\\\hbar\\\\left(\\\\Omega e^{-i\\\\Delta t}+\\\\tilde{\\\\Omega}e^{i(\\\\omega_L+\\\\omega_0)t}\\\\right)\\\\text{e}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{g} -\\\\hbar\\\\left(\\\\tilde{\\\\Omega}^*e^{-i(\\\\omega_L+\\\\omega_0)t}+\\\\Omega^*e^{i\\\\Delta t}\\\\right)\\\\text{g}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{e}, where \\\\Delta:=\\\\omega_L-\\\\omega_0 is the detuning between the light field and the atom. === Making the approximation === Two-level-system on resonance with a driving field with (blue) and without (green) applying the rotating-wave approximation. This is the point at which the rotating wave approximation is made. The dipole approximation has been assumed, and for this to remain valid the electric field must be near resonance with the atomic transition. This means that \\\\Delta\\\\ll\\\\omega_L+\\\\omega_0 and the complex exponentials multiplying \\\\tilde{\\\\Omega} and \\\\tilde{\\\\Omega}^* can be considered to be rapidly oscillating. Hence on any appreciable time scale, the oscillations will quickly average to 0. The rotating wave approximation is thus the claim that these terms may be neglected and thus the Hamiltonian can be written in the interaction picture as : H_{1,I}^{\\\\text{RWA}}=-\\\\hbar\\\\Omega e^{-i\\\\Delta t}\\\\text{e}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{g} -\\\\hbar\\\\Omega^*e^{i\\\\Delta t}\\\\text{g}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{e}. Finally, transforming back into the Schr√∂dinger picture, the Hamiltonian is given by : H^\\\\text{RWA}=\\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\omega_0}{2}\\\\text{e}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{e}- \\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\omega_0}{2}\\\\text{g}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{g} -\\\\hbar\\\\Omega e^{-i\\\\omega_Lt}\\\\text{e}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{g} -\\\\hbar\\\\Omega^*e^{i\\\\omega_Lt}\\\\text{g}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{e}. Another criterion for rotating wave approximation is the weak coupling condition, that is, the Rabi frequency should be much less than the transition frequency. At this point the rotating wave approximation is complete. A common first step beyond this is to remove the remaining time dependence in the Hamiltonian via another unitary transformation. == Derivation == Given the above definitions the interaction Hamiltonian is : \\\\begin{align} H_1 &= -\\\\vec{d}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{E} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=-\\\\left(\\\\vec{d}_\\\\text{eg}\\\\text{e}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{g}+\\\\vec{d}_\\\\text{eg}^*\\\\text{g}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{e}\\\\right) \\\\cdot\\\\left(\\\\vec{E}_0e^{-i\\\\omega_Lt}+\\\\vec{E}_0^*e^{i\\\\omega_Lt}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=-\\\\left(\\\\vec{d}_\\\\text{eg}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{E}_0e^{-i\\\\omega_Lt} +\\\\vec{d}_\\\\text{eg}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{E}_0^*e^{i\\\\omega_Lt}\\\\right)\\\\text{e}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{g} -\\\\left(\\\\vec{d}_\\\\text{eg}^*\\\\cdot\\\\vec{E}_0e^{-i\\\\omega_Lt} +\\\\vec{d}_\\\\text{eg}^*\\\\cdot\\\\vec{E}_0^*e^{i\\\\omega_Lt}\\\\right)\\\\text{g}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{e} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=-\\\\hbar\\\\left(\\\\Omega e^{-i\\\\omega_Lt}+\\\\tilde{\\\\Omega}e^{i\\\\omega_Lt}\\\\right)\\\\text{e}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{g} -\\\\hbar\\\\left(\\\\tilde{\\\\Omega}^*e^{-i\\\\omega_Lt}+\\\\Omega^*e^{i\\\\omega_Lt}\\\\right)\\\\text{g}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{e}, \\\\end{align} as stated. The next step is to find the Hamiltonian in the interaction picture, H_{1,I}. The required unitary transformation is : U = e^{iH_0t/\\\\hbar} = e^{i \\\\omega_0 t \\\\text{e}\\\\rangle \\\\langle\\\\text{e}} = \\\\text{g}\\\\rangle \\\\langle\\\\text{g} +e^{i \\\\omega_0 t} \\\\text{e}\\\\rangle \\\\langle\\\\text{e}, where the last step can be seen to follow e.g. from a Taylor series expansion with the fact that \\\\text{g}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{g}+\\\\text{e}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{e}=1, and due to the orthogonality of the states \\\\text{g}\\\\rangle and \\\\text{e}\\\\rangle. The substitution for H_0 in the second step being different from the definition given in the previous section can be justified either by shifting the overall energy levels such that \\\\text{g}\\\\rangle has energy 0 and \\\\text{e}\\\\rangle has energy \\\\hbar \\\\omega_0, or by noting that a multiplication by an overall phase (e^{i \\\\omega_0 t/2} in this case) on a unitary operator does not affect the underlying physics. We now have : \\\\begin{align} H_{1,I} &\\\\equiv U H_1 U^\\\\dagger \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=-\\\\hbar\\\\left(\\\\Omega e^{-i\\\\omega_Lt}+\\\\tilde{\\\\Omega}e^{i\\\\omega_Lt}\\\\right)e^{i\\\\omega_0t}\\\\text{e}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{g} -\\\\hbar\\\\left(\\\\tilde{\\\\Omega}^*e^{-i\\\\omega_Lt}+\\\\Omega^*e^{i\\\\omega_Lt}\\\\right)\\\\text{g}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{e}e^{-i\\\\omega_0t} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=-\\\\hbar\\\\left(\\\\Omega e^{-i\\\\Delta t}+\\\\tilde{\\\\Omega}e^{i(\\\\omega_L+\\\\omega_0)t}\\\\right)\\\\text{e}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{g} -\\\\hbar\\\\left(\\\\tilde{\\\\Omega}^*e^{-i(\\\\omega_L+\\\\omega_0)t}+\\\\Omega^*e^{i\\\\Delta t}\\\\right)\\\\text{g}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{e}\\\\ . \\\\end{align} Now we apply the RWA by eliminating the counter-rotating terms as explained in the previous section, and finally transform the approximate Hamiltonian H_{1,I}^{\\\\text{RWA}} back to the Schr√∂dinger picture: : \\\\begin{align} H_1^{\\\\text{RWA}}&=U^\\\\dagger H_{1,I}^{\\\\text{RWA}} U \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=-\\\\hbar\\\\Omega e^{-i\\\\Delta t}e^{-i\\\\omega_0t}\\\\text{e}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{g} -\\\\hbar\\\\Omega^*e^{i\\\\Delta t}\\\\text{g}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{e}e^{i\\\\omega_0t} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=-\\\\hbar\\\\Omega e^{-i\\\\omega_Lt}\\\\text{e}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{g} -\\\\hbar\\\\Omega^*e^{i\\\\omega_Lt}\\\\text{g}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{e}. \\\\end{align} The atomic Hamiltonian was unaffected by the approximation, so the total Hamiltonian in the Schr√∂dinger picture under the rotating wave approximation is : H^\\\\text{RWA}=H_0+H_1^{\\\\text{RWA}} = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\omega_0}{2}\\\\text{e}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{e}- \\\\frac{\\\\hbar\\\\omega_0}{2}\\\\text{g}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{g} -\\\\hbar\\\\Omega e^{-i\\\\omega_Lt}\\\\text{e}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{g} -\\\\hbar\\\\Omega^*e^{i\\\\omega_Lt}\\\\text{g}\\\\rangle\\\\langle\\\\text{e}. ==References== Category:Atomic, molecular, and optical physics Category:Chemical physics ","title":"Rotating wave approximation"},{"id":"2220047","text":"Pfaffenhofen is the name of several places in Europe: In Germany: * Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm, a town in Bavaria * Pfaffenhofen (district), in Bavaria * Pfaffenhofen an der Glonn, a municipality in Dachau, Bavaria * a part of the municipality of Altom√ºnster in Dachau, Bavaria * Pfaffenhofen an der Roth, a municipality in Neu-Ulm, Bavaria * Pfaffenhofen, Baden- W√ºrttemberg, a municipality in Heilbronn, Baden-W√ºrttemberg In Austria: * Pfaffenhofen, Tyrol, a municipality in Innsbruck-Land, Tyrol ==See also== * Pfaffenhoffen in Alsacia, France ","title":"Pfaffenhofen"},{"id":"2220052","text":"The RCMP Security Service (RCMP SS) is the former branch of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police which had responsibilities of domestic intelligence and security for Canada.

Prior to that, the branch was a component of the RCMP's Criminal Investigation Branch, where political security operations and criminal investigations were not distinct before 1936. The Mounties carried out extensive security service work since the force was reconstituted in 1920, when it merged with the Dominion Police and became the federal police agency solely responsible for national security. Between the wars, this work was overwhelmingly directed at the Communist Party and labour and the left more generally. In 1962, the branch was renamed the Directorate of Security and Intelligence, and in 1970 it became the RCMP Security Service. In the 1960s, it targeted Quebec nationalists, particularly the militant Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec.https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/eva8da/story-of-how-canadian-police- committed-arson-to-stop-a-black-panther-meeting ===Disbandment=== As a result of illegal tactics used by the Security Service and consequent scandals surrounding the RCMP, intelligence work was transferred to a new agency, CSIS, in 1984.

Then known as Riverdale Technical School, the facility was designed by the architect for the Board of Education, C.E.C. Dyson. In the nineteen-nineties it was extensively renovated but the original facade was maintained. On May 17, 2006, the first annual United Games were hosted at Riverdale. This was a day-long event also including students from Eastern Commerce, Monarch Park and DCTI. Former NBA star Jerome Williams acted as principal for the day. His activities included a presentation speaking out against violence,Reveille 2006, Pages 70‚Äì71 (School Yearbook) barbecuing lunch with students, and overseeing games designed to build relationships between the schools by forming teams with students from all four schools, rather than having a team for each school. Riverdale provides numerous sports teams and clubs throughout the year. Some big sports include field hockey, swim team, cross country, track and field, volleyball, basketball, soccer, ice hockey, and badminton. There are also many clubs including The Riverdale Athletic Association (RAA), Riverdale Raiders Robotics (R3P2), Riverdale Environmental Action League (R.E.A.L), Free the Children, Students Against Sexual Stereotype Discrimination (SASSD), and the Chinese Culture Club. Riverdale Collegiate celebrated its centennial on May 12, 2007. On February 10, 2015, it was reported that the TDSB was launching a review of schools for possible closure. Riverdale Collegiate Institute was incorrectly listed out of a possible seventy schools which the TDSB considers under-used and under review.

It is considered an early example of \\"true crime\\" fiction, and contains Hugo's early thoughts on societal injustice which thirty years later he would flesh out in his novel Les Mis√©rables. Charles Carlier, merchant, and editor of the Revue de Paris considered the work to be of such great educational value that he arranged for copies to be sent to all the deputies in France. ==Plot== Claude Gueux is a poor, hungry inhabitant of Troyes, who has received no education or help from society whatsoever. One day, missing of everything, he steals enough for three days of firewood and bread to feed his mistress and child. But he is caught, condemned to five years and sent to the Clairvaux Prison, an old abbey turned into a high-security detention center. There, the prisoners work as tailors in dirty workshops by day, and sleep in musty cells by night. Before going to sleep, they are given small portions of food to be able to survive through the following day. But Claude Gueux is a big eater, and the tiny quantities of food he is given are not large enough for him. So one of his cellmates, a young and shy criminal named Albin, spontaneously offers to share his food with him. That is the starting point of a long-lasting friendship. However, the prison is ruled by an avid, presumptuous and simply evil man, referred to as the \\"Director\\". He is jealous of Claude's innate ability to inspire friendship and obedience from all other prisoners, although he has many times used him to keep the prison under control. Seeing the friendship between Albin and Claude, he figures out the best way to irritate and hurt Claude would be to separate them forever, and he does just that. When Claude asks the Director why he has done this, the Director replies 'because I felt like it'. Claude takes this very badly, and in the following months he repeatedly asks the Director to bring back Albin to him. As the Director never does it, Claude makes a radical decision: he will kill the Director. So one day, he obtains an axe and a pair of scissors at the prison workshop, and waits there for the Director's night time inspection. When the Director arrives, he asks Claude, who isn't supposed to be in the workshop, 'why are you over here?'. Claude then asks the director one last time to free Albin. Once again, the Director refuses. The Director says 'don't mention it again, stop boring me'. Claude again asks why he did this to him, and the Director once again replies 'because I felt like it'. Claude then slices the Directors skull open with the axe and kills him. Immediately afterwards, Claude tries to kill himself with the scissors by repeatedly stabbing them into his own chest. But Claude does not die, and a judicial inquiry begins in which he admits murdering the Director and gives the reason as being that he felt like it. He then becomes ill for a few months as a result of his wounds, and when he has fully recovered, he appears before the assize court of Troyes. In court, Claude makes an eloquent speech in which he calmly tells the judge the full details of the events which had provoked him to commit the crime of murder, and he admits his guilt. However, when the King's attorney then states that Claude Gueux had committed the murder unprovoked, Claude becomes angry and he reiterates a long series of acts of extreme provocation on the part of the Director. The president of the court then sums up the case, and in doing so he only mentions the facts about Claude Gueux which are adverse, albeit incontrovertibly true. Claude is then found guilty and sentenced to death. Claude declines to appeal, but upon returning to the prison, a nun who had nursed him when he was recovering from his wounds, begs him to reconsider. He agrees out of gratitude, although he knows very well his request won't be listened to. In the following days, he is forbidden to come out from his cell or even to go to the workshops. His friends in the prison throw various objects into his room with which he could easily, according to the writer, escape from the jail. But Claude just returns those objects to the guardians. Finally comes the day in which he is to be executed, his demand for reconsideration having been refused. He is brought to a Catholic priest, to which he asks pardon for all his past sins. He sees the man that will bring an end to his life, and declares he does not consider him guilty of anything and pardons him completely. Then, a coach escorts him to the marketplace of Troyes, where a guillotine has been prepared. Before getting executed, he gives a coin, his only possession, to the priest that has come with him, and asks him to give it to the poor. Then, the guillotine's blade falls upon his neck, and he dies. A lengthy epilogue follows the story, in which Victor Hugo criticizes the lack of proportionality as between education and criminal punishment, and the cruel French society of the nineteenth century.

Doty attended the Lowville Academy several miles north of Martinsburg in Lowville, New York. In 1818, Doty moved to Detroit, the capital of Michigan Territory, where he became an apprentice to Charles Larned, the attorney general. On November 20, 1818, he was admitted to the bar in Wayne County and Michigan Territory. He practiced law until September 29, 1819, when he was appointed clerk of court for Michigan Territory. In June 1820 he resigned the clerkship in order to serve as secretary to the Lewis Cass expedition, a summer-long exploration of the part of Michigan Territory lying west of Lake Michigan as far as the headwaters of the Mississippi River. Upon his return to Detroit, Doty resumed his legal practice. In the winter of 1822 Doty traveled to Washington, D.C., where on March 13, with the sponsorship of Henry Wheaton, he was admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1823, a new federal judicial district was created for northern and western Michigan Territory, covering what is now the state of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Doty was appointed as the federal judge for the district by President James Monroe. Before taking up his new duties, on April 14, 1823, Doty married Sarah Collins at Whitesboro, New York. Because he was required to live within his district, Doty and his new wife moved from Detroit to Prairie du Chien in 1823. Doty regularly held court at Prairie du Chien, Green Bay, and Mackinac. He also served as the first postmaster of Prairie du Chien from 1823 to 1824. In 1824, Doty moved to Green Bay, where he lived until 1841. Doty remained the district judge until he was replaced by David Irvin in 1832. ==Territorial politics== Following his career as a judge, Doty served as a member of the Michigan Territorial Council from 1834 to 1835, representing the western part of the territory. In this capacity Doty argued for the creation of a new territorial government for Wisconsin, sending petitions to Congress in favor of splitting Michigan Territory into two parts, one east and one west of Lake Michigan. Doty had supported this idea as early as 1824, and argued that the growing number of residents in Wisconsin were not adequately provided for by the territorial government in Detroit, which was hundreds of miles away from any settlement in Wisconsin. Doty claimed that votes sent by residents west of Lake Michigan could not be sent to Detroit in time to be counted, and that the residents in Lower Michigan cared little about the affairs west of the lake. In 1835, his wishes were partially granted when the Governor of Michigan Territory created a separate legislature to govern the western part of the territory as Michigan prepared for statehood. In 1835, Doty campaigned to represent western Michigan Territory as a delegate in Congress, but he lost in a three-way election to George Wallace Jones. Both Doty and Jones were running as Democrats, but Doty had little true loyalty to any political party. He was conservative in view and usually aligned himself with whichever people were most popular at any given time. After losing the election, Doty turned to land speculation and bought thousands of acres of land across the state, some of which he began developing into the city of Madison, Wisconsin. Doty in 1858, by William F. Cogswell In 1836, Wisconsin Territory was officially created. Doty hoped to be the territorial governor, but President Andrew Jackson appointed Henry Dodge, Doty's longtime political rival, to the post. With no public title, Doty worked to improve his land holdings in what would become the city of Madison. Doty had this land surveyed and platted, and made plans to create a city on the isthmus between lakes Mendota and Monona. To gain recognition for the planned city, Doty lobbied the new territorial legislature to select his proposed city as the capital of Wisconsin. A temporary capital had already been established at Belmont, Wisconsin, but its distance from Milwaukee and Green Bay coupled with the dissatisfaction of many legislators towards the facilities at Belmont made it likely that the capital would be moved. Doty used numerous tactics to ensure that Madison would be made capital city, wooing legislators with plans for canals and railroads and offering legislators who voted to make Madison the capital choice lots in the new city. Madison was declared permanent capital in November, 1836, and construction at the new city began in 1837. In 1838, Doty was elected as Wisconsin Territory's congressional delegate, defeating George W. Jones in a rematch of the 1835 election. Despite being elected as a Democrat, Doty formed personal friendships with several Whigs in Washington, D.C., including Henry Clay. In 1840, Whig Party candidate William Henry Harrison was elected president, and he made plans to appoint Doty to the governorship of Wisconsin Territory despite Doty's status as a Democrat. Harrison died before he could make the appointment, but vice president John Tyler fulfilled Harrison's desire after ascending to the presidency in 1841. Doty was largely unsuccessful as territorial governor, the Dodge supporters in the territorial legislature rejected most of the legislation Doty supported, and Doty failed on four separate occasions to get public support for Wisconsin statehood. Doty's term ended in 1844, and he was not reappointed by Tyler, who instead selected Nathaniel P. Tallmadge to the post. This left Doty to once again return to his private life. ==Wisconsin statehood== Doty's house in Neenah, Wisconsin In 1846, Doty returned to politics, this time as a delegate to the First Wisconsin Constitutional Convention. Doty came to the convention as an independent, but sided with the Whigs on most issues and emerged as the opposition leader at the convention, which had a clear Democratic majority. After much debate, the convention produced a constitution, but the state's residents considered the document to be too radical and voted it down in a referendum, despite public campaigns for the constitution led by Doty and other delegates. A second convention called in late 1847 produced a constitution that was accepted by the people, and this enabled Wisconsin to achieve statehood in 1848. Doty was elected to the United States House of Representatives shortly after Wisconsin became a state, and served from 1849 to 1853 as the representative of Wisconsin's newly created 3rd congressional district and served as part of the 31st and 32nd Congresses. He was replaced by John B. Macy. After leaving Congress, Doty left public life and retired to his home on an island (now named Doty Island) between Neenah and Menasha, Wisconsin.Doty's Island His log-cabin home, relocated from the east end of the island, is located in Doty Park on the southeastern riverfront of Doty Island (on the island's Neenah side).Doty, James Duane 1799 ‚Äì 1865 It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==Career in Utah== In 1861, Doty returned to public service when Republican President Abraham Lincoln appointed him to the position of Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Utah Territory. Doty was successful in this position. In 1863, Stephen Selwyn Harding, Utah's territorial governor, was removed from office after public backlash from his criticism of the LDS Church and the practice of polygamy. Lincoln appointed Doty to the governorship shortly thereafter. As governor, Doty was able to repair the relationship between the federal government and the territory's Mormons. Doty also promoted the construction of schools and negotiations with local Native American tribes. ==Family== *Charles Doty: Doty's son *Morgan Lewis Martin, cousin ==Death== Doty died in office at age 65 on June 13, 1865, shortly after the outbreak of Utah's Black Hawk War.

He started his playing career as an amateur for his local team AA Rekem, before achieving success with Standard Li√®ge and PSV. Nicknamed \\"The Lion (of Flanders)\\", Gerets was regarded as one of the top right backs in Europe at his peak and is considered one of the greatest players in Belgian football history. He is famous for having captained PSV to their first and only European Cup win in 1988. As a coach, Gerets is best known for his advocacy of systems thinking. He is one of six managers ‚Äì along with Jos√© Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti, Giovanni Trapattoni, Tomislav Iviƒá and Ernst Happel ‚Äì to have won domestic league championships in at least four countries. ==Club career== Gerets began his career playing for amateur side AA Rekem before joining then titleholders Standard de Li√®ge. Making his debut 16 April 1972 coming on for Silvester Takaƒç against FC Diest. In the 1972‚Äì73 season Standard reached the Cup final, manager Vlatko Markoviƒá let Gerets start despite not being an established first team member as Standard lost 2‚Äì1 to fierce rivals Anderlecht. The following season, Gerets replaced 29-year-old Jacques Beurlet and became the first choice right back for the Rouches. In 1975 Gerets made his debut for the national team. Gerets played for Standard Li√®ge, Milan, MVV Maastricht and PSV, winning among others the 1987‚Äì88 European Cup, two Belgian championships and six Dutch championships. Gerets was an offensively-minded right back, known for his stamina, tactical discipline, grit and mental toughness. He was also known for long distance throw-ins. He is the third-most capped player for the Belgium national team, with 86 appearances and two goals. ===Standard Li√®ge=== In the 1980s, a new generation of players emerged at Standard. Noted manager Ernst Happel was hired, and later the club brought Raymond Goethals back to Belgium. Players like Arie Haan, Guy Vandersmissen, Michel Preud'homme, Walter Meeuws, Jos Daerden and Simon Tahamata became key players, whilst Gerets was the captain of the team. In 1980, Standard finished runners-up in the league, before winning the 1981 National Cup with a 4‚Äì1 win over Lokeren SC. In 1982, Standard won the title by beating Waterschei SV Thor in the last match of the season. A few days later, they faced Barcelona in the European Cup Winners' Cup final, which they lost 2‚Äì1. The influence of Gerets on Standard's success was recognised when he was awarded the 1982 Belgian Golden Shoe. The following year he captained Standard to another league title, their ninth overall, which would prove to be their last until 2007‚Äì08. ===PSV=== Gerets (left) and Frits Philips (right) posing with the European Cup In 1985, Gerets joined PSV playing together with Ruud Gullit, Frank Arnesen, Huub Stevens and Willy van de Kerkhof followed by Brazilian star Rom√°rio. In 1986, Gerets won the title with PSV, and after the departure of Gullit in 1987, Gerets became the new captain. Under Guus Hiddink PSV won the league and cup double three years in a row, Gerets scoring twice in the cup final against Roda JC. In 1988 PSV reached the UEFA European Cup final facing Benfica. After 120 minutes, it was still 0‚Äì0; PSV eventually won on penalties. In 1990, Bobby Robson was appointed as Hiddink's successor. Under Robson, Gerets won another two titles with PSV then he retired at the end of the 1991‚Äì1992 season at the age of 37. ==International career== Gerets registered 86 caps for the Belgium national team, making him the third-most capped player in their history. He made his debut for the squad in 1975, and played at four major tournaments: the 1980 European Championship, 1982 World Cup, 1986 World Cup, and 1990 World Cup. In 1980, Gerets played in his first European Championship in Italy. He scored the opening goal in a 2‚Äì1 win against Spain which ensured Belgium qualified as group winners. The tournament is remembered for the inspired performance of the offensively-minded Belgium (around rising stars such as Jan Ceulemans, Eric Gerets, Jean-Marie Pfaff and Erwin Vandenbergh) who unexpectedly reached the final, only losing to West Germany (1‚Äì2) by a Hrubesch goal two minutes from time. At the 1982 World Cup, Belgium, captained by Gerets, recorded one of their most famous victories with a 1‚Äì0 win over defending champions Argentina in the first game of the tournament held at Camp Nou with a goal by Erwin Vandenbergh, and an excellent defensive display to hold off a young Diego Maradona. Four years later, they achieved their best World Cup run at that time in 1986 when they placed fourth under command of players like Jan Ceulemans, Jean-Marie Pfaff and captain Gerets. Belgium surprisingly won against favourites the Soviet Union with stars such as Igor Belanov and Rinat Dasayev (3‚Äì4) after extra time. Belgium also beat Spain on penalties, but they lost to eventual champions Argentina in the semi-final (0‚Äì2), inspired by Maradona. Despite their defeat, Belgium would end up in fourth place ‚Äì their best finish in World Cup competition until it was surpassed in 2018 when they reached third place. Gerets would also captain his nation to the 1990 World Cup finals. Belgium failed to convert their chances against England in the second round. They lost in the last minute of extra time after a goal by David Platt. ===International goals=== :Scores and results list Belgium's goal tally first. {  - ! # !! Date !! Venue !! Opponent !!

FC Kaiserslautern and VfL Wolfsburg before joining Galatasaray at the end of the 2004‚Äì05 season. In the 1996‚Äì97 season, he won the Belgian championships with Lierse, reprising the feat in the season 1998‚Äì99 with Club Brugge. He also won the Dutch championships twice (1999‚Äì2000 and 2000‚Äì01) with PSV. In the 2005‚Äì06 season, Gerets won the Turkish Premier Super League with Galatasaray. In May 2007, he left the club, and on 25 September became Marseille's coach. In his first year with Marseille in 2007, he managed to get the team from the bottom of the league up to finish their 2007‚Äì08 season in third place. On 29 April 2009, he confirmed that he would not be in charge of Marseille after the summer when his contract expired. On 26 May 2009, he signed a contract to take over as head coach of Saudi club Al-Hilal for two years for an annual fee of ‚Ç¨1.8 million. On 6 July 2010, he signed a four-year contract with Morocco. He would do the job part-time until he completed the Asian Champions League campaign with Al Hilal but stranded in the semi-finals. He was in charge of Morocco for almost two years. He was sacked on 15 September 2012 after a Morocco's 2‚Äì0 defeat against Mozambique in the first- leg of the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations qualification.

He played a leading role in establishing the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich as a dedicated training academy for engineers. ==Life== John Armstrong was born on 31 March 1674 in the village of Ballyan, in what is now County Offaly in Ireland. He was the eldest son of Robert (c.1651‚Äì1716) and Lydia Armstrong (c.1649‚Äì1715), originally from the Scottish Borders and distantly related to the notorious reiver Johnnie Armstrong. He had two sisters, Lydia (1680-1715) and Elizabeth (1679-ca 1730); his brothers Samuel (1676-1710) and Michael (1678-1757) also served in the army. In 1710, he married Anna Burroughs (ca 1690-1725) and they had five daughters, Lydia (1718-1775), Anne (1719-1783), Frances (1720-1763), Mary (1721-1790) and Priscilla (1725-?). ==Career== Duke of Ormonde (1665-1745); his support was crucial to Armstrong's early career The 1688 Glorious Revolution sent James II into exile and in an attempt to regain his kingdoms, he landed in Ireland in March 1689, launching the Williamite War in Ireland; in 1691, Armstrong joined the Duke of Ormonde's Horse Guards, part of the Williamite army. Captured by Jacobite forces, he was released when the war ended with the October 1691 Treaty of Limerick and in 1695, he enrolled in his relative Philip Armstrong's troop, part of Wood's Regiment of Horse, later 3rd Dragoon Guards. After the Nine Years War ended with the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697, the regiment returned to England. At the start of the War of the Spanish Succession, he served at Cadiz under Ormonde, who recommended him to Holcroft Blood (1660-1707), Marlborough's chief engineer. Armstrong served in the Flanders campaign, including Blenheim in 1704 and the Siege of Bouchain in 1711. He worked with fellow engineer and long-time acquaintance Thomas Lascelles and they remained close colleagues until Armstrong's death in 1742. He managed to retain his positions through the political struggles of 1712-1715 and was appointed Quartermaster-General to the Forces just before the war ended with the 1713 Peace of Utrecht. Latcham, Oxford DNB The treaty included the provision that France 'level the fortifications of Dunkirk, block up the port and demolish the sluices that scour the harbour, (which) shall never be reconstructed.' For decades before and after, Dunkirk was a major privateer base for raiding British merchantmen, since it was possible to reach the North Sea in a single tide and escape Royal Navy patrols in the Channel. This made it a high profile operation of great significance to the powerful London mercantile interest and in September 1713, Armstrong and his colleague Thomas Lascelles were appointed to supervise operations.Correspondence with the duke of Newcastle and others relating to Dunkirk, etc., (British Library, Add. MSS 32689‚Äì32845). Royal Brass Foundry, Woolwich; built in 1717 following a casting accident in May 1716 where Armstrong narrowly escaped death or injury After the accession of George I in 1714, Marlborough was restored as Master-General of the Ordnance and initiated a series of reforms. Armstrong became Chief Royal Engineer, with his predecessor Michael Richards as Surveyor-General of the Ordnance; on his recommendation, the Ordnance Service was divided in 1716 into artillery and sappers or engineers, later the Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery. Latcham, Oxford DNB In May, Armstrong was at The Foundery in Moorfields watching a demonstration of captured French cannon being recast when an explosion killed 17 of the 25 people present; he was one of the very few to escape injury and the accident led to the institution of the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich. He returned to England in 1718 with Lascelles taking over at Dunkirk; in addition to his official duties, he was involved in multiple activities, becoming a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1723. His proposals for improving port facilities at King's Lynn were included as an appendix to Thomas Badeslade's 1725 work 'History of the ancient and present state of the navigation of the port of King's Lyn.' In the 1720s, he designed and constructed a lake at Blenheim Palace, later replaced by a Capability Brown feature. Latcham, Oxford DNB He was closely involved in setting up the Royal Arsenal and Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, served as Colonel of the Royal Regiment of Ireland from 1735 to 1742 and promoted Major- General in 1739. Late in 1741, he was taken ill at his office in the Tower of London where he died on 15 April 1742; he was buried in the chapel attached to the Tower, the Church of St Peter ad Vincula. ==ReferencesSources== * * ; * * * - - Category:1674 births Category:1742 deaths Category:British Army generals Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Royal Irish Regiment (1684‚Äì1922) officers Armstrong Category:Irish soldiers in the British Army Category:People of the Nine Years' War ","title":"John Armstrong (British Army officer)"},{"id":"2220126","text":"Antoninus is a Latin masculine given name that is an alternate form of Antonius.

Leipzig, 1854, S. 1 == About == The work of the D√ºsseldorf School is characterized by finely detailed yet fanciful landscapes, often with religious or allegorical stories set in the landscapes. Major members of the D√ºsseldorf School advocated \\"plein air painting\\", and tended to use a palette with relatively subdued and even colors. The D√ºsseldorf School derived from and was a part of the German Romantic movement. Prominent members of the D√ºsselorf School included von Schadow, Karl Friedrich Lessing, Johann Wilhelm Schirmer, Andreas Achenbach, Hans Fredrik Gude, Adolph Tidemand, Oswald Achenbach, and Adolf Schr√∂dter. The D√ºsseldorf School had a significant influence on the Hudson River School in the United States, and many prominent Americans trained at the D√ºsseldorf Academy and show the influence of the D√ºsseldorf School, including George Caleb Bingham, David Edward Cronin, Eastman Johnson, Worthington Whittredge, Richard Caton Woodville, William Stanley Haseltine, James McDougal Hart, Helen Searle, and William Morris Hunt, as well as German √©migr√© Emanuel Leutze.

He graduated from Harvard College.https://www.olympic.org/news/john-and-sumner-paine-usa- shooting Paine was a member of the Boston Athletic Association, the association were sending over members to Athens for the 1896 Summer Olympics, Paine decided to go along but first stopped in Paris to convince his brother Sumner to join him. Paine entered all three of the pistol events at the 1896 Games, but actually competed in only one. He, along with his brother Sumner Paine, was disqualified from the rapid fire pistol event for not having the appropriate caliber pistol. Both of the Paines used Colt revolvers, firearms that were far superior to those used by their opponents in the 25 metre military pistol event, John won the event easily, scoring 442 points on 25 hits out of 30 shots, Sumner was not far behind, at 380 points on 23 hits; the third-place finisher, the Greek Nikolaos Morakis, scored only 205 points. Paine then withdrew from the 30 metre free pistol event, citing his desire to not embarrass his Greek hosts, but it also said he had an agreement with his brother, that who ever won the first event between them, they would drop out the next event. After the Olympics, Paine went on to fight in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War before returning to Boston, Massachusetts, and becoming a wealthy investment banker. Paine is also the Great-grandfather to C√®cile Tucker who competed in 1996 Summer Olympics in a rowing event. ==References== Category:1870 births Category:1951 deaths Category:Olympic shooters of the United States Category:Shooters at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:19th- century sportsmen Category:Olympic gold medalists for the United States in shooting Category:American male sport shooters Category:ISSF pistol shooters Category:Olympic medalists in shooting Category:Medalists at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:Harvard College alumni ","title":"John Paine (sport shooter)"},{"id":"2220139","text":"Stoner or Stoners may refer to: ==People== * Stoner (bass guitarist) * Alyson Stoner (born 1993), American actress and dancer * Andrew Stoner (born 1960), Australian politician, member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, and the Leader of the New South Wales National Party *Casey Stoner (born 16 October 1985) Australian motorcycle racer, world champion in 2007 and 2011 * Clayton Stoner (born 1985), Canadian ice hockey player * Edmund Clifton Stoner (1899‚Äì1968), theoretical physicist * Eugene Stoner (1922‚Äì1997), weapons designer *James A.F.

He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball for the San Francisco Giants, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Atlanta Braves from 1966 to 1973. ==Playing career== Born in Crawfordsville, Indiana, Dietz was signed by the San Francisco Giants as an amateur free agent out of Greenville, South Carolina before the start of the 1960 season. He showed some promise as a hitter, posting a .354 batting average with 35 home runs and 101 runs batted in while playing for the El Paso Sun Kings in the Texas League in 1963. Dietz made his major league debut with the Giants on June 18, 1966 at the age of 24. Nicknamed Mule, he played as the Giants backup catcher behind Tom Haller in 1967. In September, Dietz was named to the 1967 Topps All-Star Rookie Team. In February 1968, the Giants were in need of good infielders, and with four young catching prospects in their system, including Dietz, club president Chub Feeney decided to trade Haller along with a player to be named later, to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Ron Hunt and Nate Oliver. Dietz shared catching duties with Jack Hiatt and Bob Barton in 1968, producing a .272 batting average with 6 home runs and 38 runs batted in. Dietz is remembered for his role in a controversial umpiring decision during the 1968 season. The Giants were facing Dodgers' pitcher Don Drysdale, who was in the midst of a scoreless inning streak that eventually reached a record-setting innings. The Giants had the bases loaded with no outs and Dietz at bat. Dietz was hit by a pitch, apparently ending Drysdale's scoreless innings streak. However, home plate umpire Harry Wendelstedt, citing a rarely enforced rule, refused to allow Dietz to take first base, claiming that Dietz did not attempt to avoid being struck by the ball. Drysdale then retired Dietz and the next two batters, keeping his scoreless streak alive. Dietz was the Giants catcher on September 17, 1968, when Gaylord Perry pitched a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals. In 1969, Dietz continued to share the catching duties with Hiatt and Barton. When the other two players were traded before the start of the 1970 season, Dietz became the Giants' regular starting catcher. In his first season as a full-time player in 1970, Dietz hit for a .337 batting average with 18 home runs and 77 runs batted in at mid-season. Although he was not listed on the All-Star ballot and received few write-in votes, the manager for the National League All-Star team, Gil Hodges, named Dietz as a reserve player for the National League team. In the 1970 All-Star Game, Dietz replaced Johnny Bench in the top of the seventh inning and led off the bottom of the ninth inning with a home run off Catfish Hunter that helped spark a rally that tied the game. The National League went on to win the game in the twelfth inning with a climactic collision at home plate between Pete Rose and Ray Fosse (It was Dietz who was in the on deck circle, congratulating Rose immediately after the collision). He ended the 1970 season with career-highs in batting average (.300), home runs (22), runs batted in (107), walks (109) and in on-base percentage (.426). His 1970 season remains historic as of 2009, as he is the only catcher to tally 100 walks, 100 RBI and hit .300 in the same Major League Baseball season. Dietz was an integral member of the 1971 Giants team that clinched the National League Western Division title. The Giants had a nine- game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 1, but held on during a pennant race to win the division by a narrow one-game margin. Dietz caught every game during the tense final stages of the season, and provided offensive support with 19 home runs and 72 runs batted in. In the only post-season appearance of his career, Dietz had only one hit in 15 at-bats, as the Giants lost to the eventual world champion Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1971 National League Championship Series. In 1972, Dietz fell from favor with the Giants' management for his role as player representative during the 1972 Major League Baseball strike that delayed the start of the season. Other reports stated that the Giants gave up on Dietz because of his defensive liabilities, having led National League catchers in passed balls in 1970 and 1971. Soon after the strike was settled, he was claimed off waivers by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Dietz broke his wrist on July 30 and missed much of the 1972 season. In 1973, Dietz had an excellent season as a reserve first baseman and catcher for the Braves, batting .295 with a .474 on-base percentage. However, the Braves released him after the season, and after no team signed him for 1974, Dietz' career was over at the age of 32. ==Career statistics== In an eight-year major league career, Dietz played in 646 games, accumulating 478 hits in 1,829 at bats for a .261 career batting average along with 66 home runs, 301 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .390. Although he was better known for his power hitting, he was a capable defensive catcher, ending his career with a .981 fielding percentage. ==Later life== After his retirement as a player, Dietz served as a minor league coach and manager. He managed the San Jose Giants in 1993 and 1994, the Sioux Falls Canaries in 1995 and the Sonoma County Crushers from 1996 to 1999. Dietz died at age 63 of a heart attack in Clayton, Georgia on June 28, 2005. He was survived by his wife and children.http://www.thedeadballera.com/Obits/Dietz.Dick.Obit.html ==References External links == * BaseballLibrary.com - biography * Cooperstown Confidential - biographical essay * San Francisco Chronicle - obituary Category:1941 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Arizona Instructional League Giants players Category:Artesia Giants players Category:Atlanta Braves players Category:Baseball players from Indiana Category:El Paso Sun Kings players Category:Eugene Emeralds players Category:Fresno Giants players Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players Category:Major League Baseball catchers Category:Minor league baseball coaches Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:National League All-Stars Category:People from Clayton, Georgia Category:People from Crawfordsville, Indiana Category:Phoenix Giants players Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:Sioux Falls Canaries managers Category:Tacoma Giants players Category:Tigres de Aragua players ","title":"Dick Dietz"},{"id":"2220149","text":"Rhythm & Blues was a tag team composed of The Honky Tonk Man and Greg \\"The Hammer\\" ValentineRhythm & Blues: Greg Valentine attempts to duplicate Honky Tonk Mania and falls short. in the World Wrestling Federation from 1989 to 1991 and later on in the independent circuit for a short run. ==HistoryBackground=== Both the Honky Tonk Man and Greg Valentine were a part of manager Jimmy Hart's stable of wrestlers in the WWF, and both had previously held the WWF Intercontinental Title. Greg Valentine had also held the WWF Tag Team Championship with Brutus Beefcake as one half of The Dream Team. ===Team=== In 1988, The Hart Foundation turned face and started a feud with former manager Jimmy Hart for picking The Fabulous Rougeaus over them. Honky Tonk Man and Greg Valentine teamed up (under the team name of ‚ÄúDouble Trouble,‚Äú though the announcers rarely used this name) to defend Jimmy Hart through the early parts of 1989 with the two teams facing off at WrestleMania V with the Hart Foundation winning the match. After the loss Honky Tonk Man and Valentine focused on singles feuds with \\"Superfly\\" Jimmy Snuka and ‚ÄùRugged‚Äù Ronnie Garvin respectively. After the Fabulous Rougeaus left the WWF, Jimmy Hart reunited the Hammer and the Honky Tonk Man, gave them the team name ‚ÄúRhythm and Blues,‚Äù and made changes to Greg Valentine‚Äôs appearance. Valentine had always been a blonde, ungimmicked wrestler who favored the traditional wrestling robe, but when teamed with the Honky Tonk Man, Valentine‚Äôs hair got dyed jet black, he was given Elvis style shades, a white jacket and a guitar he quite obviously did not know how to play. Commentator Gorilla Monsoon nicknamed Greg Valentine ‚ÄúBoxcar‚Äù when he saw his changed appearance (most likely after Blues singer ‚ÄúBoxcar Willie‚Äù). As a commentator, Roddy Piper once opined \\"Elvis would be turnin' over in his grave if he was dead.\\" In an interview for World Wrestling Insanity, the Honky Tonk Man states the team name was a suggestion made by Rick Rude. Perhaps their most memorable moment came at WrestleMania VI when they were driven to the ring in a pink Cadillac driven by the then unknown Diamond Dallas Page. In the ring, they debuted their new song, \\"Hunka Hunka Honky Love\\"; the song was interrupted by The Bushwhackers who attacked them and broke their guitars much to the delight of the fans. The two teams had a lengthy feud over the summer of 1990 before Rhythm and Blues challenged the tag team champions the Hart Foundation for the titles during the fall. The team had several shots at the gold but came up short every time. At the 1990 Survivor Series, Rhythm and Blues partnered with Ted DiBiase on his \\"Million Dollar Team\\" along with the debuting Undertaker, taking on Dusty Rhodes' \\"Dream Team\\" of the Hart Foundation and Koko B. Ware. DiBiase would go on to be the only survivor for his team. ===Break up=== Near the end of 1990 the Honky Tonk Man and Greg Valentine started arguing when Greg Valentine got tired of Jimmy Hart‚Äôs interference in their matches. This was supposed to lead to a feud between Greg Valentine and the Honky Tonk Man but the Honky Tonk Man left the federation in January 1991 thus nullifying the feud. At some point after both men left the WWF the team reunited in the Northern States Wrestling Alliance where they won the tag team titles once. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Northern States Wrestling Alliance **NSWA Tag Team Championship ==See also== *The Blond Bombers ==References *The official website of Greg Valentine *WWE Hall of Fame Profile: Greg Valentine *Honky Tonk Man interview on WWE.com Category:WWE teams and stables ","title":"Rhythm and Blues (professional wrestling)"},{"id":"2220157","text":"Pumpkin seeds just scooped from the fruit Pumpkin seeds after shelling, roasting, and salting Dried pumpkin seeds in husks A pumpkin seed, also known in North America as a pepita (from the Mexican , \\"little seed of squash\\"), is the edible seed of a pumpkin or certain other cultivars of squash. The seeds are typically flat and asymmetrically oval, have a white outer husk, and are light green in color after the husk is removed. Some cultivars are huskless, and are grown only for their edible seed. The seeds are nutrient- and calorie- rich, with especially high content of fat (particularly linoleic acid and oleic acid), protein, dietary fiber, and numerous micronutrients. Pumpkin seed can refer either to the hulled kernel or unhulled whole seed, and most commonly refers to the roasted end product used as a snack. ==Cuisine== Pumpkin seeds are a common ingredient in Mexican cuisine and are also roasted and served as a snack. Marinated and roasted, they are an autumn seasonal snack in the United States, as well as a commercially produced and distributed packaged snack, like sunflower seeds, available year-round. Pepitas are known by their Spanish name (usually shortened), and typically salted and sometimes spiced after roasting (and today also available as a packaged product), in Mexico and other Latin American countries, in the American Southwest, and in specialty and Mexican food stores. The earliest known evidence of the domestication of Cucurbita dates back 8,000‚Äì10,000 years ago, predating the domestication of other crops such as maize and common beans in the region by about 4,000 years. Changes in fruit shape and color indicate intentional breeding of C. pepo occurred by no later than 8,000 years ago. The process to develop the agricultural knowledge of crop domestication took place over 5,000‚Äì6,500 years in Mesoamerica. Squash was domesticated first, with maize second, followed by beans, all becoming part of the Three Sisters agricultural system. As an ingredient in mole dishes, they are known in Spanish as pipi√°n. A Mexican snack using pepitas in an artisan fashion is referred to as pepitor√≠a. Lightly roasted, salted, unhulled pumpkin seeds are popular in Greece with the descriptive Italian name, passatempo (\\"pastime\\"). The pressed oil of the roasted seeds of a Cucurbita pepo subsp. pepo var. 'styriaca' is also used in Central and Eastern Europe as cuisine. An example of this is pumpkin seed oil. Pumpkin seeds can also be made into a nut butter. ==Nutrition== Dried, roasted pumpkin seeds are 2% water, 49% fat, 15% carbohydrates, and 30% protein (table). In a 100 gram reference serving, the seeds are calorie-dense (574 kcal), and a rich source (20% of the Daily Value, DV, or higher) of protein, dietary fiber, niacin, iron, zinc, manganese, magnesium, and phosphorus (table). The seeds are a moderate source (10‚Äì19% DV) of riboflavin, folate, pantothenic acid, sodium, and potassium (table). Major fatty acids in pumpkin seeds are linoleic acid and oleic acid, with palmitic acid and stearic acid in lesser amounts. ===Oil=== The oil of pumpkin seeds, a culinary specialty in and important export commodity of Central Europe, is used in cuisine as a salad and cooking oil. The following are ranges of fatty acid content in C. maxima pepitas The data are found in Tables 1‚Äì3 on pp. 4006‚Äì4010 of this USDA reference .

A writing implement or writing instrument is an object used to produce writing. Writing consists of different figures, lines, and or forms. Most of these items can be also used for other functions such as painting, drawing and technical drawing, but writing instruments generally have the ordinary requirement to create a smooth, controllable line. Another writing implement employed by a smaller population, is the stylus used by blind users in conjunction with the slate for punching out the dots in Braille. ==Autonomous== These have an inherent functionality in that their useful life corresponds to the length of their physical existence, i.e. they cannot \\"run out\\" and persist as useless objects. ===Without pigment=== The oldest known examples were created by incising a flat surface with a rigid tool rather than applying pigment with a secondary object, e.g., Chinese jiaguwen carved into turtle shells. However, this may simply represent the relative durability of such artifacts rather than truly representing the evolution of techniques, as the meaningful application of pigment is attested in prehistoric cave paintings such as the ones at Lascaux. The ancient Sumerians and their successor cultures, such as the Babylonians, produced their cuneiform writing by pressing a triangular stylus into soft clay tablets, creating characteristic wedge-shaped marks. The clay tablets were then baked to harden them and permanently preserve the marks. Several other ancient cultures such as Mycenaean Greece also inscribed their records into clay tablets but did not routinely bake them; much of the Linear B corpus from Minoan Crete was accidentally preserved by a catastrophic fire which hard-baked those tablets. The Romans used lead styli with wax tablets which could be \\"erased\\" by rubbing the beeswax surface smooth again. In the modern era, hand held computers and certain other computer input devices use a stylus to enter information onto a screen by applying pressure rather than by depositing pigment. Words and names are still commonly inscribed into commemorative objects, such as the engraved winners' names on the silver Stanley Cup or the Gettysburg Address carved into the stone wall of the Lincoln Memorial, but the requisite tools are not exclusively considered to be writing instruments. ===With inherent pigment=== The 3rd-4th-century writing implements from Mtskheta, Georgia. The original form of \\"lead pencil\\" was the leaden stylus used by the ancient Romans, who also used it to write on wood or papyrus by leaving dark streaks where the soft metal rubbed off onto the surface. The concept has been revived in recent times as the core of the \\"inkless pen\\": a lead-based metal alloy that leaves dark markings on paper by abrading small pieces of core onto the surface. However, most modern \\"lead pencils\\" have a nonpoisonous core of greyish-black graphite mixed with various proportions of clay for consistency, enclosed within an outer wooden casing to protect the fragile graphite from being snapped apart or from leaving marks on the user's hand. White chalk has been traditionally used in schoolrooms to write on a main blackboard at the front of the room. In the 19th century, and indeed well into the 20th century, when paper was less readily available, individual students also wrote with chalk on their own small slates. Both pencils and chalk exist in variants which can create marks in other colors, but colored pencils and colored chalk are generally considered to be art supplies rather than writing instruments. Similarly, although very young children may use colorful wax crayons to write words into their pictures, writing is not considered to be the primary use of crayons. A wax pencil resembles both a crayon and a pencil in that it contains a brightly colored wax core within a protective paper casing, but its proportions are closer to that of a standard pencil. Wax pencils are primarily used to write onto nonporous surfaces such as porcelain or glass. Normal pencils, chalk, and crayons all share the characteristic that they cannot \\"run out\\". The useful life of these implements is closely linked to their physical existence. However, specialized accessories such as pencil sharpeners may be required to reshape the working end of the pigment core or to remove the outer casing from around the tip. ==Assisted== These require the presence of an added pigment in order to write, and are useless when \\"empty\\". ===Pens=== The pen is the most common form of writing implement. It has a hard tip which applies ink to a surface. Capillary-action dip pens Initially, pens were made by slicing a suitable nib point from the end of a thin, hollow natural material which could retain a small reservoir of ink by capillary action. However, these ink reservoirs were relatively small, requiring the pen to be periodically dipped back into an external inkwell for replenishing. Reed pens were used by the ancient Egyptians to write on papyrus. Quill pens were standard in Europe and the United States up through the 18th and 19th centuries, and are still used in various contexts, such as calligraphy and formal settings such as major bank transactions. The most common quills were taken from the wings of geese or ravens, although the feathers of swans and peacocks were sometimes favored for prestige. A dip pen has a steel nib (the pen proper) and a pen-holder. Dip pens are very versatile, as the pen-holder can accommodate a wide variety of nibs that are specialized for different purposes: copperplate writing, mapping pens, and five-pointed nibs for drawing music staves. They can be used with most types of ink, some of which are incompatible with other types of pen. Automatic pens are a category of dip pen, in which the nib is in two parts and can hold a larger quantity of ink. However, like all of its precursors, the steel-nibbed dip pens had a limited ink reservoir and a tendency to drip inkblots on the page. Fountain pens A letter written with fountain pen. Fountain pens were developed in the 19th century. These consist of the nib unit, an ink reservoir chamber, and an external casing. The casing usually includes a cover for the nib, in order to protect its shape and keep the ink from evaporating dry or wicking into the user's pocket. Depending on the design of the pen, the ink reservoir can be filled in several different ways: direct addition by eyedropper, suction from an internal mechanism, or disposable pre-filled cartridges. Some cartridge- based fountain pens can be fitted with \\"converters\\", which are separate piston/suction reservoirs of the same dimensions as the pen's usual refill cartridge; these allow the pen to refill from bottled ink. Only certain types of ink can be used in a fountain pen, to avoid clogging up the nib unit mechanism. Although the larger reservoir of fountain pens requires less frequent ink replenishment, the ink may inconveniently spill out in certain contexts to stain the paper, fingers, or clothing of an unwary writer. Differences in air pressure may cause spectacular effects when travelling by airplane. Disposable pens A large number of new pen types were popularized in the 20th century. Some of them are not constructed to be refilled with ink after they run dry; although others can theoretically have their internal ink compartment replaced, the widespread custom is to simply throw away the entire pen when its ink is no longer accessible. These types include the ballpoint pen (often called a biro in many Commonwealth countries) and the felt tip pen. Both of these have subtypes which are popularly called by their own specific names, usually based on the type of their ink, such as the fluorescent highlighter, the rollerball pen, and the gel pen. ===Mechanical pencils=== Unlike the construction of a traditional wooden pencil around a solid graphite core, a mechanical pencil feeds a small, mobile piece of graphite through its tip. An internal mechanism controls the position of the graphite by friction, so that although it remains steady while writing, the graphite can be advanced forward to compensate for gradual wear or retracted to protect it when not in use. The graphite in mechanical pencils is typically much narrower than in wooden pencils, frequently in sub-millimeter diameters. This makes them particularly useful for fine diagrams or small handwriting, although different sizes of refill leads cannot be interchanged in the same pencil unless it has been specially designed for that purpose. ===Brushes=== Although in Western civilization writing is usually done with some form of pencil or pen, other cultures have used other instruments. Chinese characters are traditionally written with a brush, which is perceived as lending itself to a graceful, flowing stroke. A brush differs from a pen in that instead of a rigid nib, the brush is tipped with soft bristles. The bristles are gently swept across the paper with just enough pressure to allow ink to wick onto the surface, rather than mashing down the brush to the extent of substantial friction resistance. Although pens with semi-flexible nibs and liquid ink can also vary their stroke width depending on the degree of applied pressure, their variation range is far less obvious. Traditionally, brushes have been loaded with ink by dipping the bristles into an external pool of ink on an inkstone, analogous to a traditional dip pen with an inkwell. Some companies now make \\"brush pens\\" which in that regard resemble a fountain pen, with an internal ink reservoir built into the handle which can be refilled with preloaded cartridges or a bottle-fill converter. ==Accessories== A wooden pencil extender. Other implements indirectly associated with writing include erasers for pen and pencil, pencil sharpeners, pencil extenders, inkwells, blotter paper, and rulers and related drawing instruments. Pounce pots were a precursor of blotting paper, being a dispenser for powdery material for drying the paper. Stencils can be used to create standardised letters, patterns or signatures. There are also pencil sharpeners that can exclusively be used with wooden pencils. ==See also== *List of pen types, brands and companies *Writing in space == References == * ","title":"Writing implement"},{"id":"2220160","text":"Sumner Paine (May 13, 1868 - April 18, 1904) was an American shooter. He competed at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens. Born in 1868, Paine's father was Charles Jackson Paine, who was a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War, and also was the older brother to John Paine. Sumner briefly attended Harvard University before ending up at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, he earned an M.D. but never practiced, instead he went off to Paris, France, to work. Paine entered all three of the pistol events in the 1896 Games. He, along with his brother John Paine, was disqualified from the rapid fire pistol because their firearms were not of the appropriate caliber. The Paine brothers used Colt revolvers in the 25 metre military pistol event, these pistols were superior to the arms used by their opponents, and the brothers had little difficulty winning the top two spots. Sumner finished second with 380 points on 23 hits (of 30 shots) to John's 442 points on 25 hits. The next closest shooter (Nikolaos Morakis from Greece) scored only 205 points. After winning the military pistol, John withdrew from the 30 metre free pistol event, Sumner easily won this event as well, scoring exactly the same number of points (442) as John had to win the military pistol event, he did this on one fewer hit (24), though, in this case, the second place competitor scored 285 points. In 1901, Paine went home to find his wife in bed with his daughter's music teacher. To ward him away from the house, he shot four times at him, missing each time. He was briefly jailed and charged with assault until the police realized who he was and accepted that he must have missed on purpose. He was then released. Paine died aged just 35 years old due to pneumonia. ==References== Category:1868 births Category:1904 deaths Category:American male sport shooters Category:Olympic shooters of the United States Category:Shooters at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:19th-century sportsmen Category:Olympic gold medalists for the United States in shooting Category:Olympic silver medalists for the United States in shooting Category:ISSF pistol shooters Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Medalists at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:University of Colorado School of Medicine alumni ","title":"Sumner Paine"},{"id":"2220161","text":"Ellawalakankanamge Asoka Ranjit De Silva (born March 28, 1956) is a Sri Lankan cricketer who played in 10 Tests and 28 ODIs from 1985 to 1992.

He was born to Quimby Hugh Kilgore and Laura Jo Kilgore. His father worked as an oil driller and contractor. He attended the public schools and graduated from the law department of West Virginia University at Morgantown in 1914 and was admitted to the bar the same year. He taught school in Hancock, West Virginia in 1914 and 1915, and organized the first high school in Raleigh County, West Virginia in the latter year. He was the school's first principal for a year, and commenced the practice of law in Beckley, West Virginia in 1916. During the First World War he served in the infantry from 1917 and was discharged as a captain in 1920; in 1921 he organized the West Virginia National Guard and retired as a colonel in 1953. He was married to Lois Elaine Lilly in Huntington, West Virginia, in 1921. He was judge of the Raleigh County criminal court from 1933 to 1940, and was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1940, and won re-election twice. He was a member of the Senate from January 3, 1941 until his death in Bethesda Naval Hospital in 1956. Kilgore was a member of the Truman Committee,Maddox, Robert F., \\"The Politics of World War II Science: Senator Harley M. Kilgore and the Legislative Origins of the National Science Foundation\\", West Virginia History, Volume 41 (1979), p 22. and from October 1942, he chaired the Subcommittee on War Mobilization of the Military Affairs Committee, otherwise known as the Kilgore Committee,Maddox, Robert F., \\"Senator Harley M Kilgore and Japan's World War II Business Practices\\", West Virginia History, Volume 55 (1996), pp 127-142, on-line at http://www.wvculture.org/history/journal_wvh/wvh55-6.html, paragraphs 2 & 6, retrieved 05 Nov 2011 that oversaw U.S. mobilization efforts for World War II. He also helped establish the National Science Foundation in 1950. Senator Kilgore was West Virginia's favorite-son candidate in 1948 Democratic presidential primaries and won his home state unopposed. He died on February 28, 1956, aged 63 and was interred in Arlington National Cemetery. ==National Science Foundation== In 1942, American manufacturing expert Herbert Schimmel advised Kilgore to form a committee to centralize scientific research done for the war effort. The Kilgore Committee drafted legislation for an Office of Technological Mobilization, which would have power to fund research, share patents and trade secrets, and facilities that could help the war effort. Additionally, the organization would be able to draft scientists and facilities for the war effort. In 1943, government scientists, most notably Vannevar Bush, voiced agreement with the spirit of Kilgore's proposal, but opposed the bill's aim to involve government administration of science funding and patent sharing. As the war neared its end, many prominent scientists feared a peacetime Kilgore plan. The Kilgore Committee, in an effort to mollify scientists concerned with a government-run funding agency, proposed calling the proposed organization a Foundation, to give the superficial impression of a private, philanthropic funding body like the Rockefeller Foundation. The scientists running the war-time Office of Scientific Research and Development sought to bypass the Kilgore Committee in forming a postwar science policy. While ostensibly working with Kilgore to plan for a science administration, Vannevar Bush privately obtained an invitation from President Franklin D. Roosevelt to write his own plan for a government-funded science foundation. Senator Warren Magnuson of Washington introduced a proposal based on Bush's report, Science, the Endless Frontier, in July 1945. The report contradicted much of Kilgore's vision of a science-funding organization accountable to the government. Kilgore felt betrayed by Bush's failure to mention this alternate bill, and remained on hostile terms with Bush for years afterwards. After many months of negotiations with interest groups of scientists and manufacturers, Kilgore and Magnuson introduced a modified bill to fund the National Science Foundation in 1946, which did not pass. At the same time, Republican Senator Alexander Smith of New Jersey introduced a bill for an agency more similar to Bush's vision. The Smith bill passed both houses of United States Congress. Kilgore encouraged his former colleague, now President Harry S. Truman to veto the Smith bill, in large part because of the potential it made for the military to dominate scientific research. Truman followed Kilgore's advice and let the bill expire through a pocket veto. Kilgore also encouraged Truman to establish a Presidential Research Board to be led by John Steelman, former Director of the War Mobilization and Reconversion, which Truman then did in October 1946. By 1948, other agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the United States Department of Defense had been established to fund specific domains of scientific research. The National Science Foundation would now solely fund basic science. In early 1948, Truman, Steelman, and Senator Smith reached a compromise in administration of the foundation. Later that year, Kilgore and Smith cosponsored the bill that President Truman would finally sign on May 10, 1950 to establish the National Science Foundation. ==See also== * List of United States Congress members who died in office (1950‚Äì99) ==NotesReferences== Category:1893 births Category:1956 deaths Category:People from Harrison County, West Virginia Category:United States senators from West Virginia Category:West Virginia lawyers Category:Educators from West Virginia Category:Democratic Party United States senators Category:West Virginia state court judges Category:West Virginia Democrats Category:West Virginia University College of Law alumni Category:Military personnel from West Virginia Category:Burials at Arlington National Cemetery Category:West Virginia National Guard personnel Category:20th-century American judges Category:People from Beckley, West Virginia Category:People who died in office ","title":"Harley M.

Some folks consider it best to use person-first language, for example \\"a person with a disability\\" rather than \\"a disabled person.\\" However identity-first language, as in \\"autistic person\\" or \\"Deaf person\\", is preferred by many people and organizations. There is disagreement as to what causes harm.Views vary with geography and culture, over time, and among individuals. Many terms that some people view as harmful are not viewed as hurtful by others, and even where some people are hurt by certain terms, others may be hurt by the replacement of such terms with what they consider to be euphemisms (e.g., \\"differently abled\\" or \\"special needs\\"). Some people believe that terms should be avoided if they might hurt people; others hold the listener responsible for misinterpreting terms used with non-intended to be harmful intent. For some terms, the grammar structure of their use determine if they are harmful. The person-first stance advocates for saying \\"people with disabilities\\" instead of \\"the disabled\\" or \\"a person who is deaf\\" instead of \\"a deaf person\\". However, some advocate against this, saying it reflects a medical model of disability whereas \\"disabled person\\" is more appropriate and reflects the social model of disability. On the other hand, there is also a grammar structure called identity-first language that construes disability as a function of social and political experiences occurring within a world designed largely for nondisabled people. ==A== *Able- bodied, there is an implied value judgement comparing a person with a disability verses one without *Abnormal *Addict, use person with a drug problem or person with a substance use disorder instead *Afflicted *Attention- seeking, commonly used to label someone who is suffering emotionally *Autism or autistic, when used as an insult. ==B== *Batty *Birth defect *Blind, especially when used metaphorically (e.g., \\"blind to criticism\\") or preceded by \\"the\\".

The dorsal nerve cord is only one embryonic feature unique to all chordates, among the other four chordate features-- a notochord, a post-anal tail, an endostyle, and pharyngeal slits. The dorsal hollow nerve cord is a hollow cord dorsal to the notochord. It is formed from a part of the ectoderm that rolls, forming the hollow tube. This is important, as it distinguishes chordates from other animal phyla, such as Annelids and Arthropods, which have solid, ventral tubes. The process by which this is performed is called invagination. The cells essentially convolute into the body cavity, arranging themselves on the dorsal plane above the notochord, as mentioned above. The evolutionary explanation to this adaptation from a solid cord to hollow tube is unknown. In vertebrates, the dorsal nerve cord is modified into the central nervous system, which comprises the brain and spinal cord. Dorsal means the \\"back\\" side, as opposed to ventral which is the \\"belly\\" side of an organism. In bipedal organisms dorsal is the back and ventral is the front.

It is not the product of K and t divided by V, as would be the case in a true dimensionless number. In peritoneal dialysis, it isn't dimensionless at all. It was developed by Frank Gotch and John Sargent as a way for measuring the dose of dialysis when they analyzed the data from the National Cooperative Dialysis Study. In hemodialysis the US National Kidney Foundation Kt/V target is ‚â• 1.3, so that one can be sure that the delivered dose is at least 1.2. In peritoneal dialysis the target is ‚â• 1.7/week. Despite the name, Kt/V is quite different from standardized Kt/V. ==Rationale for Kt/V as a marker of dialysis adequacy== K (clearance) multiplied by t (time) is a volume (since mL/min √ó min = mL, or L/h √ó h = L), and (K √ó t) can be thought of as the mL or L of fluid (blood in this case) cleared of urea (or any other solute) during the course of a single treatment. V also is a volume, expressed in mL or L. So the ratio of K √ó t / V is a so- called \\"dimensionless ratio\\" and can be thought of as a multiple of the volume of plasma cleared of urea divided by the distribution volume of urea. When Kt/V = 1.0, a volume of blood equal to the distribution volume of urea has been completely cleared of urea. The relationship between Kt/V and the concentration of urea C at the end of dialysis can be derived from the first- order differential equation that describes exponential decay and models the clearance of any substance from the body where the concentration of that substance decreases in an exponential fashion: :V \\\\frac{dC}{dt} = -K \\\\cdot C \\\\qquad(1) where * C is the concentration [mol/m3] * t is the time [s] * K is the clearance [m3/s] * V is the volume of distribution [m3] From the above definitions it follows that \\\\frac{dC}{dt} is the first derivative of concentration with respect to time, i.e. the change in concentration with time. This equation is separable and can be integrated (assuming K and V are constant) as follows: :\\\\int \\\\frac{dC}{C} = \\\\int -\\\\frac{K}{V}\\\\, dt. \\\\qquad(2a) After integration, :\\\\ln(C) = - \\\\frac{K \\\\cdot t}{V} + \\\\mbox{const} \\\\qquad(2b) where * const is the constant of integration If one takes the antilog of Equation 2b the result is: :C = e^{- \\\\frac{K \\\\cdot t}{V} + const } \\\\qquad(2c) where *e is the base of the natural logarithm By integer exponentiation this can be written as: :C = C_0 e^{-\\\\frac{K \\\\cdot t}{V}} \\\\qquad(3) where * C0 is the concentration at the beginning of dialysis [mmol/L] or [mol/m3]. The above equation can also be written as : \\\\frac{K \\\\cdot t}{V} = \\\\ln \\\\frac{C_o}{C} \\\\qquad(4) Normally we measure postdialysis serum urea nitrogen concentration C and compare this with the initial or predialysis level C0. The session length or time is t and this is measured by the clock. The dialyzer clearance K is usually estimated, based on the urea transfer ability of the dialyzer (a function of its size and membrane permeability), the blood flow rate, and the dialysate flow rate. In some dialysis machines, the urea clearance during dialysis is estimated by testing the ability of the dialyzer to remove a small salt load that is added to the dialysate during dialysis. ==Relation to URR== The URR or Urea reduction ratio is simply the fractional reduction of urea during dialysis. So by definition, URR = 1 -C/C0. So 1-URR = C/C0. So by algebra, substituting into equation (4) above, since ln C/C0 = ‚Äì ln C0/C, we get: :\\\\frac{K \\\\cdot t}{V} = -\\\\ln (1-URR). \\\\qquad(8) ===Sample calculation=== Patient has a mass of 70 kg (154 lb) and gets a hemodialysis treatment that lasts 4 hours where the urea clearance is 215 mL/min. * K = 215 mL/min * t = 4.0 hours = 240 min * V = 70 kg √ó 0.6 L of water/kg of body mass = 42 L = 42,000 mL Therefore: : Kt/V = 1.23 This means that if you dialyze a patient to a Kt/V of 1.23, and measure the postdialysis and predialysis urea nitrogen levels in the blood, then calculate the URR, then -ln (1-URR) should be about 1.23. The math does not quite work out, and more complicated relationships have been worked-out to account for the fluid removal (ultrafiltration) during dialysis as well as urea generation (see urea reduction ratio). Nevertheless, the URR and Kt/V are so closely related mathematically, that their predictive power has been shown to be no different in terms of prediction of patient outcomes in observational studies. ===Post-dialysis rebound=== The above analysis assumes that urea is removed from a single compartment during dialysis. In fact, this Kt/V is usually called the \\"single-pool\\" Kt/V. Due to the multiple compartments in the human body, a significant concentration rebound occurs following hemodialysis. Usually rebound lowers the Kt/V by about 15%. The amount of rebound depends on the rate of dialysis (K) in relation to the size of the patient (V). Equations have been devised to predict the amount of rebound based on the ratio of K/V, but usually this is not necessary in clinical practice. One can use such equations to calculate an \\"equilibrated Kt/V\\" or a \\"double-pool Kt/V\\", and some think that this should be used as a measure of dialysis adequacy, but this is not widely done in the United States, and the KDOQI guidelines (see below) recommend using the regular single pool Kt/V for simplicity. == Peritoneal dialysis == Kt/V (in the context of peritoneal dialysis) was developed by Michael J. Lysaght in a series of articles on peritoneal dialysis. The steady-state solution of a simplified mass transfer equation that is used to describe the mass exchange over a semi-permeable membrane and models peritoneal dialysis is :C_B=\\\\dot{m}/K. \\\\qquad(6a) where *CB is the concentration in the blood [ mol/m3 ] *KD is the clearance [ m3/s ] *\\\\dot{m} is the urea mass generation [ mol/s ] This can also be written as: :K=\\\\dot{m}/C_B. \\\\qquad(6b) The mass generation (of urea), in steady state, can be expressed as the mass (of urea) in the effluent per time: :\\\\dot m=\\\\frac{C_E \\\\cdot V_E}{t}. \\\\qquad(6c) where *CE is the concentration of urea in effluent [ mol/m3 ] *VE is the volume of effluent [ m3 ] *t is the time [ s ] Lysaght, motivated by Equations 6b and 6c, defined the value KD: : K_D = \\\\frac{C_E \\\\cdot V_E}{C_B \\\\cdot t} \\\\qquad(6d) Lysaght uses \\"ml/min\\" for the clearance. In order to convert the above clearance (which is in m3/s) to ml/min one has to multiply by 60 √ó 1000 √ó 1000. Once KD is defined the following equation is used to calculate Kt/V: : \\\\frac{K \\\\cdot t}{V} = \\\\frac{7/3 \\\\cdot K_D}{V_D} \\\\qquad(7a) where *V is the volume of distribution. It has to be in litres (l), as the equation is not really non-dimensional. The 7/3 is used to adjust the Kt/V value so it can be compared to the Kt/V for hemodialysis, which is typically done thrice weekly in the USA. ===Weekly Kt/V=== To calculate the weekly Kt/V (for peritoneal dialysis) KD has to be in litres/day. Weekly Kt/V is defined by the following equation: : \\\\mbox{Weekly } Kt/V = \\\\frac{7 K_D [l/\\\\mbox{day}]}{V [l]}. \\\\qquad(7b) ===Sample calculation=== Assume: *C_{B\\\\mbox{ mean}}=22.817\\\\mbox{ mmol/L} *C_{D}=17.524\\\\mbox{ mmol/L} *V_{D}=3.75\\\\mbox{ L per exchange or }15\\\\mbox{ L/day} *V_{B}=40.6\\\\ L Then by Equation 6d KD is: 1.3334e‚àí07 m3/s or 8.00 mL/min or 11.52 L/d. Kt/V and the weekly Kt/V by Equations 7a and 7b respectively are thus: 0.45978 and 1.9863. ===A simplified analysis of Kt/V in PD=== On a practical level, in peritoneal dialysis the calculation of Kt/V is often relatively easy because the fluid drained is usually close to 100% saturated with urea, i.e. the dialysate has equilibriated with the body. Therefore, the daily amount of plasma cleared is simply the drain volume divided by an estimate of the patient's volume of distribution. As an example, if someone is infusing four 2 liter exchanges a day, and drains out a total of 9 liters per day, then they drain 9 √ó 7 = 63 liters per week. If the patient has an estimated total body water volume V of about 35 liters, then the weekly Kt/V would be 63/35, or about 1.8. The above calculation is limited by the fact that the serum concentration of urea is changing during dialysis. In automated PD this change cannot be ignored; thus, blood samples are usually measured at some time point in the day and assumed to be representative of an average value. The clearance is then calculated using this measurement. ==Reason for adoption== Kt/V has been widely adopted because it was correlated with survival. Before Kt/V nephrologists measured the serum urea concentration (specifically the time-averaged concentration of urea (TAC of urea)), which was found not to be correlated with survival (due to its strong dependence on protein intake) and thus deemed an unreliable marker of dialysis adequacy. ==Criticisms/disadvantages of Kt/V== * It is complex and tedious to calculate. Many nephrologists have difficulty understanding it. * Urea is not associated with toxicity. * Kt/V only measures a change in the concentration of urea and implicitly assumes the clearance of urea is comparable to other toxins. (It ignores molecules larger than urea having diffusion-limited transport - so called middle molecules). * Kt/V does not take into account the role of ultrafiltration. * It ignores the mass transfer between body compartments and across the plasma membrane (i.e. intracellular to extracellular transport), which has been shown to be important for the clearance of molecules such as phosphate. Practical use of Kt/V requires adjustment for rebound of the urea concentration due to the multi-compartmental nature of the body. * Kt/V may disadvantage women and smaller patients in terms of the amount of dialysis received. Normal kidney function may be modeled as optimal Glomerular filtration rate or GFR. GFR is usually normalized in people to body surface area. A man and a woman of similar body surface areas will have markedly different levels of total body water (which corresponds to V). Also, smaller people of either sex will have markedly lower levels of V, but only slightly lower levels of body surface area. For this reason, any dialysis dosing system that is based on V may tend to underdose smaller patients and women. Some investigators have proposed dosing based on surface area (S) instead of V, but clinicians usually measure the URR and then calculate Kt/V. One can \\"adjust\\" the Kt/V, to calculate a \\"surface-area-normalized\\" or \\"SAN\\"-Kt/V as well as a \\"SAN\\"-standard Kt/V. This puts a wrapper around Kt/V and normalizes it to body surface area.Daugirdas JT et al. Surface-area-normalized (SAN) adjustment to Kt/V and weekly standard Kt/V. J Am Soc Nephrol (abstract) 2006. and Appendix A. Handbook of Dialysis, 4th Edition. Daugirdas JT, Blake PB, Ing TS, editors. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, 2007. ===Importance of total weekly dialysis time and frequency=== Kt/V has been criticized because quite high levels can be achieved, particularly in smaller patients, during relatively short dialysis sessions. This is especially true for small people, where \\"adequate\\" levels of Kt/V often can be achieved over 2 to 2.5 hours. One important part of dialysis adequacy has to do with adequate removal of salt and water, and also of solutes other than urea, especially larger molecular weight substances and phosphorus. Phosphorus and similar molecular weights remain elusive to filtration of any degree. A number of studies suggest that a longer amount of time on dialysis, or more frequent dialysis sessions, lead to better results. There have been various alternative methods of measuring dialysis adequacy, most of which have proposed some number based on Kt/V and number of dialysis sessions per week, e.g., the standardized Kt/V, or simply number of dialysis sessions per week squared multiplied by the hours on dialysis per session; e.g. the hemodialysis product by Scribner and Oreopoulos It is not practical to give long dialysis sessions (greater than 4.5 hours) 3x/week in a dialysis center during the day. Longer sessions can be practically delivered if dialysis is done at home. Most experience has been gained with such long dialysis sessions given at night. Some centers are offering every-other-night or 3x/week nocturnal dialysis. The benefits of giving more frequent dialysis sessions is also an area of active study, and new easy-to-use machines are permitting easier use of home dialysis, where 2‚Äì3+ hour sessions can be given 4‚Äì7 days per week. ===Kt/V minimums and targets for hemodialysis=== One question in terms of Kt/V is, how much is enough? The answer has been based on observational studies, and the NIH-funded HEMO trial done in the United States, and also, on kinetic analysis. For a US perspective, see theKDOQI Hemodialysis Adequacy Update 2006. and for a United Kingdom perspective see:U.K. Renal Association Clinical Practice Guidelines, 2006 Update. According to the US guidelines, for 3x/week dialysis a Kt/V (without rebound) should be 1.2 at a minimum with a target value of 1.4 (15% above the minimum values). However, there is suggestive evidence that larger amounts may need to be given to women, smaller patients, malnourished patients, and patients with clinical problems. The recommended minimum Kt/V value changes depending on how many sessions per week are given, and is reduced for patients who have a substantial degree of residual renal function. ===Kt/V minimums and targets for peritoneal dialysis=== For a US perspective, see:KDOQI Peritoneal Adequacy Update 2006. For the United States, the minimum weekly Kt/V target used to be 2.0. This was lowered to 1.7 in view of the results of a large randomized trial done in Mexico, the ADEMEX trial, and also from reanalysis of previous observational study results from the perspective of residual kidney function. For a United Kingdom perspective see:U.K. Renal Association Clinical Practice Guidelines, Peritoneal Dialysis. 2006 Update.

Ladyland lectern-style sundial.MacGibbon, T. and Ross, D. (1887 - 92). The castellated and domestic architecture of Scotland from the twelfth to the eighteenth centuries, 5v, Edinburgh. pp. 434. Scottish sundials of the renaissance period are not just more numerous than in any other country, they are also stylistically unique. This is particularly notable when the size and wealth of Scotland at the time are taken into account. They are free standing stone sculptures of the 17th and 18th centuries with many small dials inscribed on them. Accurate timetelling is clearly not the aim. Precision is sacrificed for decorative effective. Unlike the sundials of similar date on the continent where baroque decoration may be added, the mathematical complexity of the Scottish dials is decoration enough. The ancient sundials of Scotland can be grouped into three main styles: lectern, obelisk and facet-head. ==Lectern dials== These are noticeable for their sloping top like a reading desk or lectern, in the equatorial plane, usually with a star on top having dials in all its angles, and at 90 degrees to this a hemi-cylinder with a polar dial inscribed in it. The lectern usually has hollow dials on the south, east and west faces, and hour lines are inscribed in every available angle. One of the more complicated was formerly at Mid Calder House and is now at Culzean Castle. Lectern dials have some counterparts in continental Europe. This is particularly true of the Netherlands which was Scotland's primary trading partner of the time and where several lectern dials survive. ==Obelisk dials== Obelisk dials are unique to Scotland and there are only 26 of them known. The first is meant to be that at Drummond Castle. It was carved in 1630 by John Mylne the King's Master Mason. The Kirkhall composite sundial at Ardrossan Obelisk dials are made up of three parts. The base element is a square shaft with four or five square panels on each side. In these panels are often sunken dials of bowl-hollows, hearts or triangular and rectangular shapes. The middle element is an octangonal section boss. The corners may be cut away and have dials inscribed in the hollows. The crowning element is a square tapering finial which when viewed with the lower square shaft produces the obelisk appearance. This finial also has panelled sides with up to seven or eight on each side. There can be 70 or 80 surfaces in total available for dials. ==Facet-head dials== This term includes a wide variety of other types ranging from a simple cube to complex polyhedrals. The most dramatic of these is at Glamis Castle. == References Bibliography== The information here is heavily derived from the writings of Andrew Somerville who in turn used the pioneering Victorian writings of Thomas Ross. *Vol. 5 The Castellated and Domestic Architecture of Scotland, MacGibbon & Ross (1892) *The Ancient Sundials of Scotland, Andrew R Somerville (1990)'' ==External links== * Video footage of the Greenbank Garden dials * Scottish Sundials - by Location, Type and Date * Register of Scottish Sundials * A Scottish sundial erected by Robert Simson at Kirktonhall, West Kilbride. * A Scottish Sundial at Ardrossan's Civic Centre * Sundials of Scotland - a website for Scottish sundials by Dennis Cowan Category:Cultural history of Scotland ","title":"Scottish sundial"},{"id":"2220239","text":"Moses Amyraut (1596‚Äì1664), after whom Amyraldism is named. Amyraldism (sometimes Amyraldianism) is also known as the School of Saumur, post redemptionism,.. moderate Calvinism,. four-point Calvinism, or hypothetical universalism. (though it is in fact one of several hypothetical universalist systems). It is the belief that God decreed Christ's atonement, prior to his decree of election, for all alike if they believe, but he then elected those whom he will bring to faith in Christ, seeing that none would believe on their own, and thereby preserving the Calvinist doctrine of unconditional election. The efficacy of the atonement remains limited to those who believe. This doctrine is named after its formulator Moses Amyraut, and is still viewed as a variety of Calvinism in that it maintains the particularity of sovereign grace in the application of the atonement. However, detractors such as B. B. Warfield have termed it \\"an inconsistent and therefore unstable form of Calvinism.\\" ==HistoryBackground=== Hypothetical universalist teachings may be found in the writings of early Reformed theologians including Heinrich Bullinger, Wolfgang Musculus, Zacharias Ursinus, and Girolamo Zanchi. Several theologians who signed the Canons of Dort were hypothetical universalists. quoted in Moses Amyraut, originally a lawyer, but converted to the study of theology by the reading of Calvin's 'Institutes', an able divine and voluminous writer, developed the doctrine of hypothetical or conditional universalism, for which his teacher, John Cameron (1580‚Äì1625), a Scot, and for two years headmaster of Saumur Academy, had prepared the way. His object was not to set aside but to moderate Calvinism by ingrafting this doctrine upon the particularism of election, and thereby to fortify it against the objections of Roman Catholics, by whom the French Protestants, or Huguenots, were surrounded and threatened. Being employed by the Reformed Synod in important diplomatic negotiations with the government, he came in frequent contact with bishops, and with Cardinal Richelieu, who esteemed him highly. His system is an approach, not so much to Arminianism, which he decidedly rejected, as to Lutheranism, which likewise teaches a universal atonement and a limited election. Amyraut maintained the Calvinistic premises of an eternal foreordination and foreknowledge of God, whereby he caused all things to pass, the good efficiently, the bad permissively. He also admitted the double decree of election and reprobation, but his view on double predestination is modified slightly by his view of double election. He also taught that God foreordained a universal salvation through the universal sacrifice of Christ offered to all alike, on condition of faith, so that on the part of God's will and desire, the grace is universal, but as regards the condition it is particular, or only for those who do not reject it which would thereby make it ineffective. The universal redemption scheme precedes the particular election scheme, and not vice versa. He reasons from the benevolence of God towards his creatures; the traditional Reformed presentation of predestination, he thought, improperly reasons from the result and makes facts interpret the decrees. Amyraut distinguished between objective grace which is offered to all, and subjective grace in the heart which is given only to the elect. He also makes a distinction between natural ability and moral ability, or the power to believe and the willingness to believe; man possesses the former but not the latter in consequence of inherent depravity. It, therefore, takes an act of God to illuminate the mind, thereby engaging the will towards action. He was disposed, like Huldrych Zwingli, to extend the grace of God beyond the limits of the visible Church, inasmuch as God by his general providence operates upon the heathen, as in the case of , and may produce in them a sort of unconscious Christianity, a faith without knowledge; while within the Church he operates more fully and clearly through the means of grace. Those who never heard of Christ are condemned if they reject the general grace of providence, but the same persons would also reject Christ if he were offered to them. As regards the result, Amyraut agreed with the particularists. His ideology is unavailable, except for those in whom God previously works the condition of faith: for those who are included in the particular decree of election. Amyraut's doctrine created a great commotion in the Reformed Churches of France, the Dutch Republic, and Switzerland. Jean Daill√© (1594‚Äì1670), David Blondel (1591‚Äì1655), and others considered it innocent and consistent with the decrees of the Synod of Dort, where German Reformed and Anglican delegates professed similar views against the supralapsarianism of Gomarus. But Pierre Du Moulin (Molin√¶us) (since 1621 professor of the rival theological school of Sedan), Friedrich Spanheim (1600‚Äì49, Professor in Leiden), Andr√© Rivet (1572‚Äì1651, Professor in Leiden), and the theologians of Geneva opposed it. Similar charges were leveled against the Puritan great, Richard Baxter, who dealt frequently with Cyrus and Peter du Moulin. In Geneva, the chief opponent of Amyraut's scheme was Francis Turretin (1623‚Äì87).Turretin, Francis, The Atonement of Christ, Translated by James R. Willson (1978), . Amyraut's teaching was not, however, considered to be heretical or outside the Reformed confessions by its opponents., cited in The friends of Amyraut urged the love, benevolence, and impartial justice of God as well as the numerous passages in Scripture which teach that God loves 'the whole world', that he will have 'all men to be saved', that Christ died 'not for our sins only, but also for the sins of the whole world', that 'he shut up all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all'. On the other hand, it was objected that God does not really will and intend what is never accomplished; that he could not purpose an end without providing adequate means; God did not actually offer salvation to all; and that a hypothetical universalism based on an unlikely condition is an unfruitful abstraction. The national Synods at Alen√ßon, 1637; at Charenton, 1645; and at Loudun, 1659 (the last synod permitted by the French government), decided against the excommunication of Amyraut but delimited his views in order to avoid further variance with historic Reformed orthodoxy. He gave the assurance that he did not change the doctrine but only the method of instruction. His opponents allowed that the idea of a universal grace by which no one was actually saved unless included in the particular, effective decree of election, was permissible. In this way hypothetical universalism was sanctioned as a permissible view, along with the particularism that had characterized historic Reformed orthodoxy, and a schism in the French Church was avoided. The literary controversy continued for several years longer and developed a large amount of learning and ability, until it was brought to an abrupt close by the political oppressions of the Reformed Church in France.. ===17th-century England and Scotland === John Davenant (1576‚Äì1641), like Amyraut a student of John Cameron, was an English delegate at the Synod of Dort and influenced some of the members of the Westminster Assembly. He promoted \\"hypothetical universalism, a general atonement in the sense of intention as well as sufficiency, a common blessing of the cross, and a conditional salvation. The \\"root principle of the Davenant School\\" was the \\"notion of a universal desire in God for the salvation of all men.\\". In the floor debate on redemption at the Westminster Assembly, Edmund Calamy the Elder of the Davenant School attempted to insert Amyraldism into the Catechism.. Richard Baxter held to a form of Amyraldism, although he was less Calvinistic than Amyraut. He \\"devised an eclectic middle route between Reformed, Arminian, and Roman doctrines of grace: interpreting the kingdom of God in terms of contemporary political ideas, he explained Christ's death as an act of universal redemption (penal and vicarious, but not substitutionary), in virtue of which God has made a new law offering pardon and amnesty to the penitent. Repentance and faith, being obedience to this law, are the believer's personal saving righteousness... the fruit of the seeds which Baxter sowed was neonomian Moderatism in Scotland and moralistic Unitarianism in England.\\"Packer, J. I., \\"Introduction,\\" in . Popularised in England by the Reformed pastor Richard Baxter, Amyraldism also gained strong adherence among the Congregationalists and some Presbyterians in the American colonies, during the 17th and 18th centuries. === Recent === In the United States, Amyraldism can be found among various evangelical groups, such as Southern Baptists, the Evangelical Free Church of America, the dispensationalists in independent Bible Churches and independent Baptist churches. In Australia, many in the Anglican Diocese of Sydney hold to a modified \\"four point\\" Calvinism, while in England, one author, Dr Alan Clifford, pastor of the Norwich Reformed Church, tirelessly promotes Amyraldism in self-published pamphlets such as Amyraut Affirmed., critically reviewed in . Yet \\"Five point\\" Calvinism remains prevalent especially in more conservative groups among the Reformed and Presbyterian churches, Reformed Baptists, among evangelical Anglicans in England and in some non-denominational evangelical churches. ==Contrary views== Amyraldism has come under fire in recent years by contemporary Calvinist theologians who argue that one simply cannot accept that Christ died for all people in the world if not all are saved. That belief either requires a second payment for sin at the judgment, the adoption of a form of universal reconciliation, or abandonment of the penal substitution theory of the atonement. Reformed theologian, pastor, and author R.C. Sproul suggested there is confusion about what the doctrine of limited atonement actually teaches. While he considered it possible for a person to believe four points without believing the fifth, he claimed that a person who really understands the other four points must believe in limited atonement because of what Martin Luther called a resistless logic.. == References Further reading== * . * Category:Calvinist theology ","title":"Amyraldism"},{"id":"2220240","text":" The North American P-64 was the designation assigned by the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) to the North American Aviation NA-68 fighter, an upgraded variant of the NA-50 developed during the late 1930s. Seven NA-50s were purchased by the Peruvian Air Force, which nicknamed it Torito (\\"Little Bull\\"). Six NA-68s ordered by the Royal Thai Air Force were seized before export by the US government in 1941, after the Franco-Thai War and growing ties between Thailand and the Empire of Japan. These aircraft were used by the USAAC as unarmed fighter trainers. The Peruvian NA-50s subsequently saw action during the Ecuadorian‚ÄìPeruvian War of 1941. ==Design and developmentNA-50=== NA-50 \\"Torito\\" destined for Peruvian service The North American Aviation NA-50 was developed as a simple single-seat, low-wing, single-engined fighter for export. The design was developed from the NA-16/BT-9 basic training aircraft of 1935. The NA-16 evolved into a series of aircraft that were some of the most widely used advanced and basic training aircraft produced by any country, and provided the basic design for a single-engined fighter intended for small countries that needed a simple aircraft with modern capabilities and features. The NA-50 Torito (Spanish slang for \\"little bull\\"), built for Peru, was a single-seat fighter design based on the two-seat Basic Combat Demonstrator NA-44. The NA-50 was powered by an 840 hp (626 kW) Wright R-1820-G3 radial air-cooled engine that gave the NA-50 a top speed of 295 mph at 9,500 feet. It was armed with two .30 in (7.62 mm) M1919 Browning machine guns. The aircraft were manufactured in May 1939, and test-flown at the factory.Green 1961, p. 134. ===NA-68=== In 1940, the Royal Thai Air Force ordered six aircraft similar to the NA-50 that were designated NA-68. The changes in the NA-68 included a modified landing gear, new outer wings, heavier armament, and redesigned tail surfaces similar to those adopted on later production trainers. North American test pilot Lewis Waite flew the first NA-68 on 1 September 1940. ==Operational history== USAAC P-64 Peru purchased seven aircraft for the Peruvian Air Force, with deliveries completed in May 1939. In Peruvian service, these aircraft were fitted with bomb racks under the fuselage for light bombs. The Peruvian NA-50s took part in the Ecuadorian‚ÄìPeruvian War of July 1941, supporting Army of Peru ground forces.Cooper, Tom Cooper and Esteban Rivera.\\"The Most Powerful Air Force in Latin America.\\" Acig.org, 1 September 2003. Retrieved: 26 March 2010. In 1940, the NA-68s (along with a parallel order for NA-69 two seaters) ordered by the Royal Thai Air Force were en route to Thailand when their export clearance was cancelled and were returned to the United States where they were assigned the designation P-64, disarmed, and used for advanced fighter training. ==Operators== ; * Peruvian Air Force ; * United States Army Air Corps/United States Army Air Forces ==Surviving aircraft== * NA-50 XXI-41-4 (c/n 50-951). The sole surviving NA-50 is currently under restoration at Las Palmas Air Base, Lima, Peru, with it being planned that the aircraft be restored to flying by 2021. The aircraft remained in service until 1961 and was then displayed on a pedestal next to the Mausoleum of Captain Jos√© Qui√±ones Gonzales, (a Peruvian hero who died flying an NA-50), until 2018, when it was removed for restoration. * NA-68A 41-19085 (c/n 68-3061).

As of 2018, it is commanded by Vice-Amiral d‚ÄôEscadre Jean-Philippe Rolland. The ships are divided into seven categories: * The aeronaval group, which has the aircraft carrier at its core * The amphibious group, directed by \\"Projection and Command vessels\\" (currently ships of the ) * Frigates, which act either as protection for the strategic groups, or alone in monitoring, survey, presence, rescue or deterrence missions * Minesweepers * \\"Sovereignty\\" ships, which are deployed overseas and act as presence and prevention forces * Support vessels * Public service ships, and hydrographic and oceanographic vessels ==The aeronaval group== The aeronaval group is the main French Navy power projection force. It is also one of the components of the nuclear deterrence forces, since the embarked Super √âtendard and Rafale planes have nuclear capabilities. At minimum, it contains an aircraft carrier (currently ), an anti-air frigate, and a support vessel. Typically, this group also includes several anti-air and anti-submarine frigates, nuclear attack submarine ( and the future Barracuda- class submarines), and possibly additional support ships. The carrier air group can include up to 40 aircraft: Rafale, Super √âtendard and E-2 Hawkeye planes; NH-90 Ca√Øman Marine, AS365 Dauphin and AS565 Panther for the helicopters. This composition varies according to the mission and the tactical environment, and can include aircraft of the ALAT (Army) or the Arm√©e de l'Air (Air Force). Like any naval force, the aeronaval group can be assisted by land-based Breguet Atlantique aircraft. Clemenceau formed the core of the French Navy's battle force for many years.http://ffaa.net/ships/aircraft- carrier/clemenceau/history.htm One of the aeronaval group's deployments was to take part in the initial attacks on Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan as part of what became the War in Afghanistan, in response to the September 11th attacks. The group, designated Task Force 473 for the operation, comprised 2,900 men under the command of Contre-Amiral Fran√ßois Cluzel and sailed in December 2001. It consisted of the nuclear aircraft carrier Charles De Gaulle, frigates , , , the nuclear attack submarine , the tanker , and the . The Indian Ocean region deployment lasted for seven months before the group returned to France in mid-2002. The number 473 seems to be semi-permanently assigned to Charles de Gaulle and its task group, being used again during Operation Agapanthe in 2004. During the 2011 Libyan civil war, the French carrier battle group commanded from Charles de Gaulle was designated Task Force 473 and was under the command of Vice-Admiral Phillippe Coindreau. Coindreau was promoted to contre-amiral in September 2009, and he was named deputy commandant of the a√©ro-maritime force of rapid r√©action at Toulon. In English-language reports, he was described as deputy commander of the High Readiness Force Maritime Headquarters. On 29 December 2013, Task Force 473, led by the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, and comprising the destroyer , frigate Jean de Vienne, and the replenishment oiler Meuse met Carrier Strike Group Ten for an exercise in the Gulf of Oman. Carrier Strike Group Ten comprises the aircraft carrier , guided-missile cruisers and and guided- missile destroyers , , , and . In November 2015, Task Force 473 sailed again to strike Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq. The composition of the task force is French, however, the British destroyer and a frigate from the Belgian Navy, , sailed as part of the group. ==The amphibious group== Mistral-class landing platform assault The French Navy operates three large amphibious ships, which contain smaller landing craft. Aboard are helicopters, troops, and land vehicles (three amphibious assault ships). This force also operates five smaller craft which are based in Fort de France, Toulon, Papeete, Noum√©a, and La R√©union. The amphibious groups include one or several landing craft (EDAR and CTM) which allow the projection of inter-arm groups with troops, vehicles and helicopters, and one or several light transport ships (b√¢timents de transport l√©ger, BATRAL) which carry motorised infantry companies up to the beaches themselves. They can carry Puma, Cougar and NH-90 Ca√Øman Marine transport helicopters or Gazelle and Tigre combat helicopters, the Commandos Marine, minesweeping units, or Army units. Commander French Maritime Forces (COMFRMARFOR) advises ALFAN, the Admiral in command of the Naval Action Force, and when operational at sea commands from the TCDs.Minist√®re de la D√©fense ==Destroyers and frigates== The destroyers and frigates are the backbone of the French surface fleet. They secure aero-naval space and allow free action to the other components of the Navy. They are specialised according to the threat, typically escorting other forces (aeronaval or amphibious groups, submarines or civil ships). * The four anti-air destroyers/frigates, two , one and one Aquitaine air defence variant of the frigate (commencing sea trials in 2020) are designed to protect the aeronaval group against air threats. They also carry helicopters which can be used for anti-submarine warfare. * The eight multipurpose destroyers/frigates, six Aquitaine anti-submarine variants of the frigate class and two destroyers. They carry towed sonars and NH-90 Ca√Øman Marine helicopters, and have anti-ship and anti-air capabilities. The two last FREMM will be built as FREDA type frigates, a specific variant with an air-defence derivative of the FREMM. * The five s are used primarily as presence ships, to patrol national and international waters, and to take part in dispute settlement outside of Europe. They can therefore act in cooperation with international intervention, protection, special operation or humanitarian missions. They carry AS565 Panther or Lynx helicopters. * The six s are used for patrolling the French coast as well as France's overseas territories. They carry a single Eurocopter AS565 Panther for anti-submarine warfare. ==Minesweepers== Commandos de Marine Dassault Rafale fighter aircraft The minesweepers secure major French harbours, especially for the ballistic- missile submarines in Brest, and the attack submarines in Toulon. They also stay available to secure access to Toulon, Marseille, any of the harbours of the Atlantic coast, and any Allied harbour simultaneously. They are designed to be used within a larger group, interallied or international, in case of mine risks near coasts. In peacetime, these units can bring help and assistance to civilian ships, or search wrecks. This force includes 1,100 men and: * 13 minesweepers * 3 minesweeping diver groups for shallow waters. * Several sonar ships which secure the area around Brest harbour * One command and support ship ==Sovereignty vessels== These 65 vessels (as of 2019) patrol harbors, territorial waters, and the world's second largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ), including enforcing fishing, environmental, and criminal laws, and conducting or supporting recovery operations. Six s perform sovereignty tasks, mainly by controlling the large French EEZ, carrying out police action, and monitoring fishing activities. They operate in low-risk environments. All six are based overseas (two at R√©union, two at Martinique, one in French Polynesia, and one in New Caledonia) offshore patrol vessels (OPVs): * Prior to 2011, ten P 400 OPVs operated in pairs at R√©union, Martinique, French Guiana, French Polynesia, and New Caledonia. Of these, as of 2020, only La Glorieuse (P 686), based at Noum√©a, New Caledonia, remains. * Flamant (P 676), Cormoran (P 677), and Pluvier (P 678) fill similar roles of patrolling beyond territorial waters out of metropolitan France. The A-69 avisos were originally designed to counter conventional submarines, especially in coastal defence. Instead of decommissioning all 17 as planned, by 2011, nine were stripped of heavy weaponry and converted to offshore patrol vessel (Patrouilleur de haute- mer or PHM). While based in metropolitan France, they conduct routine deployments to the Indian Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Pacific Ocean, replacing eight of the original P 400-class OPVs. As of 2019, seven of the PHMs remain in service, with replacements under construction to be based in Reunion, in the Pacific, and in metropolitan France. Three Patrouilleur Antilles Guyane (PAG), based in French Guiana and Martinique, are larger and more capable of the offshore patrol mission than the P 400s. Three unique patrol vessels (Le Malin at R√©union, Arago for French Polynesia, and Fulmar for Saint Pierre and Miquelon) conduct inshore patrol missions in their respective areas. The patrol boats of the Gendarmerie Maritime carry out law enforcement operations primarily in ports and coastal waters. These include six coastal patrol boats (Patrouilleur c√¥tier de Gendarmerie maritime or PCGM), based in Cherbourg (2), Lorient, Toulon, Guadeloupe, and French Polynesia. There are twenty-four coastal surveillance launches (vedette c√¥ti√®re de surveillance maritime), nineteen deployed around metropolitan France and five deployed overseas, generally responding to both maritime and departmental prefects for law enforcement in coastal waters. Eight launches (vedette de s√ªret√© maritime et portuaire), are located in Le Havre, Cherbourg, Brest, Marseilles, and Toulon. Four overseas support and assistance vessels (b√¢timents de soutien et d'assistance outre-mer) of the have been constructed and deployed to New Caledonia, French Polynesia, R√©union, and Martinique. Two of four planned home support and assistance vessels (b√¢timents de soutien et d'assistance m√©tropolitains) of the Loire class have been constructed and deployed to Brest and Toulon (with two in each port when the last two are completed). ==Support ships== Dupuy de L√¥me Monge The four support ships allow the French naval forces to be present anywhere on the planet, regardless of the remoteness of their bases. These ships operate independently or are integrated into tactical groups. They shuttle between harbours and fleets, giving them months of operational capabilities by feeding fuel, ammunition, food, water, spare parts and mail. There is also one permanent mechanics ship, Jules Verne, which can repair other ships. The spy ship Dupuy de L√¥me is used for intelligence gathering and the tracking ship is used to develop new weapon systems, especially those related to nuclear deterrence. ==Hydrographic and oceanographic vessels== One hydro-oceanographic and three hydrographic ships help carrying out mapping and research operations, as well as gathering intelligence which could prove useful to the deployment of naval forces and their weapon systems. They are operated by the service hydrographique et oc√©anographique de la marine (SHOM). == See also == * List of active French Navy ships ==Notes== Category:French naval components Category:Military units and formations established in 1995 ","title":"Naval Action Force"},{"id":"2220253","text":"DaDa is the eighth solo studio album by American singer Alice Cooper, released on September 28, 1983 by Warner Bros. Records. DaDa would be Cooper's last album until his sober re-emergence in 1986 with the album Constrictor. The album's theme is ambiguous, however, ongoing themes in the songs' lyrics suggest that the main character in question, Sonny, suffers from mental illness, resulting in the creation of many different personalities. The album alludes strongly to the dadaist movement. Its cover was based on a painting by surrealist artist Salvador Dal√≠ titled Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire. Produced by long-time collaborator Bob Ezrin, at the time his first production with Cooper in six years, DaDa was recorded at ESP Studios in Buttonville, Ontario, Canada. DaDa peaked at No. 93 in the UK but failed to dent the US Billboard Top 200. \\"I Love America\\" was released as a single solely in the UK over a month after the album's release.

The race was not held in 1973 after track owner Roger Penske replaced the race with a Champ Car event. The inaugural event was scheduled to be 600 miles (970 km), but was shortened because of inclement weather. From 1975 to 2019, the race distance was changed to . Since 2020, the race has been at . The event has had numerous companies sponsor the race, including Pepsi and Carfax. It is the second of two NASCAR Cup Series races held annually at Michigan (the first race is held in June). The race was moved up a week in 2020 after two off weeks. Kevin Harvick was the last winner of the event, having won in 2020. ==Overall== Overall, 26 different drivers have won the race, with David Pearson holding the record for most victories in the race with five. Pearson won the inaugural event, which was shortened from to because of rain. Bill Elliott has the record for most consecutive victories, winning three from 1985 to 1987. Ford has the most manufacturers' wins with 16. Kevin Harvick is the defending winner of the race, winning it the last three times in 2018, 2019 and 2020. ==History== *1970: Restrictor plates made their racing debut in the 1970 Yankee 400 and Charlie Glotzbach drove a Dodge Daytona to the win. *1971: Bobby Allison dueled Allison edged Petty at the stripe for a season sweep at Michigan in the Holman-Moody Mercury. *1973: Although the Yankee 400 was on the NASCAR Winston Cup schedule at the beginning of the 1973 season, set for August 5, Roger Penske announced on June 8 that the 1973 Yankee 400 would not be held, citing the tight schedule that Michigan International Speedway had to accommodate in the summer of 1973. *1974: Promoter Roger Penske reinserted the Yankee 400 to Michigan's schedule after 1973 after the Michigan 400 that June turned a strong profit. David Pearson and Cale Yarborough fought hard before Cale was stopped by a mismatched set of tires late in the race. The lead changed 45 times among eight drivers. *1975: A late yellow set up a five-lap finish; Pearson and Richard Petty went at it and the lead changed on every lap down to the finish as Petty edged Pearson by a nose. *1977: Rain postponed the race to Monday and Darrell Waltrip edged Pearson to the stripe. *1978: Pearson's final win for the Wood Brothers came on a one-lap shootout as he passed Waltrip. Richard Petty crashed in the final laps, setting up the finish; he was making his debut in a second-hand 1974 bodied Chevrolet after abandoning his 1978 Dodge Magnum. *1979: Pearson was hired to drive Rod Osterlund's Chevrolet after Dale Earnhardt was injured at Pocono and he won the Michigan pole, ultimately finishing fourth. Buddy Baker led late but Richard Petty took tires on a late stop and gunned him down on the final lap; the win began a rally from a 229-point deficit to the season championship. *1981: The most competitive Michigan race ever erupted as Ron Bouchard won his first pole fresh off his electrifying Talladega win. There were 65 lead changes among 14 drivers and Richard Petty, who led 65 laps, roared from fifth to the lead with five to go and held off six other challengers. \\"This wasn't the toughest race, but it sure was the most aggravating,\\" Petty said afterward. *1987: Fellow drivers revolted against Tim Richmond at Watkins Glen the week before when he reported to the prerace drivers meeting looking sickly and acting belligerently. Before Michigan qualifying Richmond had to be rousted out of his motorhome and when he arrived at the qualifying line asked aloud, \\"Where are we?\\" When NASCAR officials Les Richter and Dick Beaty asked Hendrick officials what was wrong with Tim, Richmond appeared from nowhere and confronted both of them, then showed up late for the prerace drivers meeting. During the 400 he had an anxiety attack and the engine blew; he drove to the garage and when the crew checked the tachometer they found it had been pegged, because Richmond had deliberately overreved the engine to blow it. It became his final race ever.Poole, David (2005): TIM RICHMOND: The Fast Life And Remarkable Times Of NASCAR's Top Gun (Sports Publishing LLC, Champaign, IL), pp. 155‚Äì8 Richard Petty rallied to the lead in the final 40 laps but had to pit on a late caution and crashed after colliding with Davey Allison on the final lap as Bill Elliott took the win, his sixth Michigan win in an eight-race span. *1991: Dale Jarrett stayed out on a late caution, and in the final laps Davey Allison ran him down, but became locked in a side-by-side battle won by Jarrett by inches for his first win and the first for the Wood Brothers since 1987 at Charlotte. *1994: Just after Wally Dallenbach, Jr. was released from his ride in Richard Petty's Pontiac, Indycar veteran John Andretti took over the seat and turned heads by qualifying second. However, the story of the weekend was a savage crash in practice that left Ernie Irvan critically injured with head injuries. Irvan would recover from near-fatal injury over a year later. The race itself began with a six-car melee where Bobby Hillin, Jr. nearly flew over the second turn wall. Geoff Bodine won on Hoosier Tires. *1998: Irvan dominated the race, but Jeff Gordon ran down the leaders and won handily. Mark Martin was denied the win, the race coming days after the death of his father in a plane crash. *1999: Goodyear brought tires to Michigan designed for Fontana for Winston West racing, where Hoosier Tire was still a presence in competition against Goodyear; the new tire featured greater stagger and handled more like bias-ply tires than radials. Dale Earnhardt grabbed the lead late and got into a spirited battle with Bobby Labonte before Labonte cleared for the win. *2007. This was the first modern-day NASCAR race to be run on a Tuesday. Kurt Busch dominated all day, leading 96 laps out of the 203. Busch held off Martin Truex Jr and Jimmie Johnson in a Green White Checkered finish for his second win of the season. *2012: Greg Biffle won his second race of 2012 after Jimmie Johnson's engine blew up with five laps to go. The race was also marked by a scary crash on lap 64. Mark Martin was leading Kasey Kahne into turn 4 and was about to lap Bobby Labonte and Juan Pablo Montoya when Labonte got loose and spun. Montoya got away, but Labonte collected Martin and Kahne. While Labonte and Kahne spun into the trioval grass, Martin's car spun down pit road and was impaled on the left rear side by an opening in the pit wall at Kahne's pit stall. Martin climbed out, unharmed. The day was also a sour day for Hendrick supplied engines as three of the six cars with this engine package - Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson and Tony Stewart - all had engine part failures (Johnson had two failed engines, as he blew another one in practice). The other three, Kasey Kahne, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Ryan Newman, survived for top ten finishes. *2016: This race is memorable for it being the first NASCAR Cup Series victory for Kyle Larson. Chase Elliott would end up finishing second as he did in the prior June race earlier in the year. ==Past winners== {  style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Date ! rowspan=\\"2\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Driver ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Team ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Manufacturer ! colspan=\\"2\\"Race Distance ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Race Time ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Average Speed (mph) ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Report - !

It is about an American middle class, suburban family that is torn apart when the youngest son is kidnapped and raised by a mentally ill woman, until he appears at the front doorstep of his real mother and asks if he can mow the lawn. ==Plot summary== Wisconsin photographer and housewife Beth Cappadora leaves her youngest son, Ben, alone with his older brother for a brief moment in a crowded Chicago hotel lobby, while attending her high school reunion. The older son lets go of Ben's hand and Ben vanishes without a trace. Beth goes into an extended mental breakdown and it is left to her husband and owner of a restaurant, Pat, to force his wife to robotically care for their remaining two children, 7-year-old Vincent and infant daughter Kerry. Nine years later a young boy named Sam asks Beth if she needs the lawn mowed. Beth suspects that this boy who lives with his \\"father\\" two blocks away is in fact her lost son, and while Sam mows the lawn, she takes photographs of him to show to her husband and teenage son, who then says that he suspected the boy's true identity all along. The parents contact Detective Candy Bliss who pops in to offer wise, albeit often cryptic and conflicting, advice to Beth. It is learned that at the reunion in Chicago, the celebrity alumna Cecil Lockhart kidnapped Ben, renamed him Sam, and raised him as her own child until she was committed to a mental hospital, leaving Sam to be raised in a house only two blocks from the Cappadoras, by his adoptive father, the sensitive and intellectual George Karras. Ben was raised by a Greek-American father for nine years, while his biological parents are Italian-American. Ben is a polite, intelligent American boy who takes great pride in participating in Greek cultural rituals, much to the frustration of Pat who wants to pretend that Ben was never really abducted. Ben is faced with the cultural identity that he grew up with, and the cultural identity he would have known had he not been kidnapped. Ben's adoptive father agrees to surrender Ben to his birth family, while still living two blocks away. Torn between two worlds and having lost both of the parents that he knew, Ben expresses suicidal feelings to Beth. Ben's only memory of his biological family is one of brother Vincent and thus over a one-on-one basketball game he absolves his brother of any responsibility for his abduction, and agrees to return to live with the Cappadoras. At the end of the novel, many conflicts remain unresolved. Pat still has problems loving his sons: Ben because he can not relate to his personality and Vincent because he does not connect his teenage rebellion and cynicism to nine years of bad parenting. Beth has regained her position in the family as an equal parent, but Ben and Vincent's emotional scars may require years of intense therapy. ==Symbols, motifs, and themes== Aside from ethnicity, there is an underlined theme in the story about women's empowerment as Beth awakens from her nine-year depression to argue with Pat about how to deal with Ben's dual-ethnic and family identity. Once Beth finds Ben she also finds her own inner strength, and argues with Pat about the terms that Ben must obey in order to become integrated into the family. Pat wants Ben to abandon what he thought was his name, ethnic identity, and his father. Beth wants her son to be happy and feels that forcing Ben to abandon the past nine years of his life will only drive him away, both physically and emotionally. Vincent sees the presence of Ben as a symbol of his own guilt at allowing his younger brother to be kidnapped, and a symbol of the anger that he has built up over the past nine years in living with parents that were too caught up in their grief to give him the love and attention that he needed. His younger sister seems the most well-adjusted of the children, but that is because she was too young to remember Ben. Vincent and Pat filled in the role as parents when Beth was trapped in her depression. == Main characters == *Beth Cappadora - the main protagonist *Ben/Sam - Beth's kidnapped son *Vincent - Beth's oldest son, a sixteen-year-old boy *Kerry - Beth's daughter, who was an infant when Ben was kidnapped *Candy Bliss - the detective *Cecil Lockhart - the kidnapper of Ben *Pat Cappadora - Beth's husband *George Karras - Sam's adoptive father *Angelo & Rosmary \\"Rosie\\" Cappadora - Beth's in-laws, Pat's parents *Ellen - Beth's best friend ==Awards and nominations== The novel was the first Oprah Book Club selection in September 1996. () ==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations== There was a 1999 film of the same name based on the novel. The film is rated PG-13 for some profanity, and drama. It stars Michelle Pfeiffer and Treat Williams. This was Ryan Merriman's first feature film role. ==External links== *Publication history and summary of critical reaction Category:1996 American novels Category:Novels by Jacquelyn Mitchard Category:American novels adapted into films Category:Novels set in Wisconsin Category:Novels set in Chicago ","title":"The Deep End of the Ocean"},{"id":"2220265","text":"A pre-kindergarten playground Pre-kindergarten (also called Pre-K or PK) or pre-school is a voluntary classroom-based preschool program for children below the age of five in the United States, Canada, Turkey and Greece (when kindergarten starts). It may be delivered through a preschool or within a reception year in elementary school. Pre-kindergartens play an important role in early childhood education. They have existed in the US since 1922, normally run by private organizations. The U.S. Head Start program, the country's first federally funded pre-kindergarten program, was founded in 1967. This attempts to prepare children (especially disadvantaged children) to succeed in school. Pre-kindergartens differentiate themselves from other child care by equally focusing on building a child's social development, physical development, emotional development, and cognitive development. They commonly follow a set of organization-created teaching standards in shaping curriculum and instructional activities and goals. The term \\"preschool\\" more accurately approximates the name \\"pre-kindergarten\\", for both focus on harvesting the same four child development areas in subject-directed fashion. The term \\"preschool\\" often refers to such schools that are owned and operated as private or parochial schools. Pre-kindergartens refer to such school classrooms that function within a public school under the supervision of a public school administrator and funded completely by state or federally allocated funds, and private donations. == Programs == The National Center for Education Statistics reports that the percentage of U.S. three-, four-, and five-year olds enrolled in pre-primary programs (including kindergarten and preschool programs) has stayed roughly stable from 2000 to 2017. U.S. participation rates in 2017 were 40% for three-year-olds, 68% for four year olds, and 86% for five-year olds.Preschool and Kindergarten Enrollment, National Center for Education Statistics (last updated February 2019). As of 2016-17, a total of 44 states, plus the District of Columbia, provide at least some state funding for pre-K programs. Nine states (Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Oklahoma, Texas, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wisconsin) plus D.C. include pre-K funding in their school funding formulas.Louisa Diffey, Emily Parker, and Bruce Atchison, State Pre-K Funding 2016-17 Fiscal Year: Trends and Opportunities, Education Commission of the States (January 2017). Conversely, as of 2016-17, six states (Idaho, Montana, New Hampshire, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Wyoming) provide no state funding for pre-K. In 2013, Alabama, Michigan, Minnesota, and the city of San Antonio, Texas, enacted or expanded pre-K programs. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio was elected on a pledge of Pre-K for all city children. A poll conducted in 2014 for an early education nonprofit advocate found that 60 percent of registered Republicans and 84 percent of Democrats supported expanding public preschool by raising the federal tobacco tax. Funding for Pre-K has proven a substantial obstacle for creating and expanding programs. The issue produced multiple approaches. Several governors and mayors targeted existing budgets. San Antonio increased sales taxes, while Virginia and Maine look to gambling. In Oregon, currently 20% of kids have access to publicly funded Pre-K of any kind, and a 2016 campaign is working to fully fund Pre-K to 12 education, for all kids whose parents want them to have the option of Pre-K. A 2012 review by the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University identified Oklahoma, Georgia and West Virginia as among the leaders in public program quality and fraction of enrolled children. Florida had the highest enrollment in 2012 ‚Äî almost four-fifths of all four-year-olds. About 84 percent were in private, religion-based or family centers. That state's preschool programs did not fare well on quality measures. Other states with more than 50 percent enrollment included Wisconsin, Iowa, Texas and Vermont. In 2002, Florida voters enacted a state constitutional amendment requiring that the state establish a free voluntary pre-kindergarten (VPK) program for all four-year-old children by fall 2005.Daphna Bassok, Luke C. Miller, Eva Galdo, & Amanda J. Johnson, Florida's Voluntary Pre-Kindergarten Program: An Overview of the Largest State Pre-School Program in the Nation, EdPolicyWorks Report, University of Virginia Curry School of Education/Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy]. Florida's program is the largest state-level preschool program in the nation. It is universal, meaning that all children are eligible so long as they meet the age and residency requirement. In the 2013-14 school year, 80% of VPK programs were housed at private centers, 18% were housed at public schools, 1% were housed at family daycares, and 1% were housed at private schools. The program resulted in an increase in pre-k participation, which was about 80% in 2014. The program has suffered a decline in finding; in 2019, the Orlando Sentinel editorial board wrote that the Florida Legislature \\"has neglected the pre-K program almost since it was approved by voters.\\"Editorial: Pre-K failures are a sign of the Florida Legislature‚Äôs contempt for citizen initiatives, Orlando Sentinel (May 28, 2019). == Impact == A 2018 study in the Journal of Public Economics found in Italy that pre-kindergarten \\"increased mothers' participation in the labor market and lowered the reservation wage of the unemployed, thus increasing their likelihood of finding a job\\" but \\"did not affect children's cognitive development, irrespective of their family background.\\" A randomized control found that children randomly assigned to undertake full-day pre-K had substantially greater outcomes in cognition, literacy, math, and physical development than their peers who were randomly assigned to undertake half-day pre-K. == Children of immigrants == The US Census Bureau forecast that the foreign-born population in the United States would make up 19% of the US population by 2060 (up from 13% in 2014).Colby, S. & Ortman, J. (2014). Projections of the Size and Composition of the U.S. Population: 2014 to 2060. Current Population Reports, P25-1143. U.S. Census Bureau. Children of immigrant families face special challenges. === Cultural values and childcare options === Children of immigrants represent the fastest growing US population. Asians and Latinos are the two largest racial groups. Like all families, immigrants have choices when pursuing childcare options. Cultural differences shape childcare choices, such as attitudes towards early academic development. These differences help explain certain irregular childcare options. Compared to Latino immigrant groups, Asians are more likely than Latinos to enroll their children in pre-kindergarten programs due to the inclusion of academics. The focus of pre-academic, school readiness is important to Asian parents. Latino immigrant parents by contrast generally opt for more informal childcare options, such as parental, relative or non- relative in-home care. This is due in part to the opinion that academic skills are to be taught through formal instruction after children enter primary school. While Latino families value the acquisition of academic skills, the in-home childcare choice is a reflection of the importance of cultural and linguistic values and traditional family dynamics. Parents with limited English proficiency are more likely to choose parental or in-home care instead of pre-kindergarten programs. === Barriers === According to information from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), low-income immigrant families are less likely to use center-based childcare, such as pre- kindergarten, than children of non-immigrants. While some Latino families prefer in-home childcare, many report wanting to enroll their children in a pre-kindergarten program. Interviews with immigrant mothers revealed common motivations for seeking pre-kindergarten placements for their children, including maternal employment, opportunity to learn English and social and emotional development. Obstacles immigrant mothers reported facing included high cost, long wait-lists, a need to provide documentation (especially for illegal aliens and those who lacked English-language proficiency) and a lack of information regarding eligibility for subsidized programs. On average, immigrants tend to experience higher poverty rates due to low wages, less education and a lack of English proficiency. === Benefits === While few children would benefit from pre-kindergarten and early childhood education, immigrant children, particularly those from lower socio-economic households, stand to benefit the most. Studies indicate that first and second generation immigrants lag behind children of non-immigrant families in cognitive and language skills. Pre-K's focus on cognitive, social, emotional and physical development would address these skills and reduce the inequalities in school readiness between children from immigrant and non-immigrant families. Educators must be sensitive to sensitivities of immigrant groups regarding the acquisition of the English language versus their native-language. Pre-K could help children build either or both skills. For most US students, English fluency is essential. == See also == * Balwadi * Forest kindergarten * Transitional kindergarten * Pre-school playgroup‚Äîa related type of establishment found in the United Kingdom ==References * Child Care & Early Education Research Connections Category:Childhood Category:Early childhood education in the United States Category:Early childhood education Category:Educational stages Category:Educational years Category:School types Category:Kindergarten ","title":"Pre-kindergarten"},{"id":"2220268","text":"California-style pizza (also known as California pizza or Gourmet pizza) is a style of single-serving pizza that combines New York and Italian thin crust with toppings from the California cuisine cooking style. Its invention is generally attributed to chef Ed LaDou, and Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California. Wolfgang Puck, after meeting LaDou, popularized the style of pizza in the rest of the country. It is served in many California Cuisine restaurants. Such restaurant chains as California Pizza Kitchen, Round Table Pizza, Extreme Pizza, and Sammy's Woodfired Pizza are four major pizza franchises associated with California-style pizza. ==History== The California- style pizza was invented more or less simultaneously in 1980 by Ed LaDou (the \\"Prince of Pizza\\"), then working as a pizza chef for Spectrum Foods' Prego Restaurant in San Francisco's Cow Hollow neighborhood, and by pizza chefs working for Alice Waters at the Chez Panisse Cafe in Berkeley, California. LaDou had learned pizza-making in the 1970s as a teenager at Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi Too, a traditional New York-style pizzeria in Mountain View, California. He made pizzas briefly at Ecco, an upscale restaurant at the Hyatt Hotel in Palo Alto, California, before starting at Prego. Although Prego specialized in classic, Italian-style thin-crust pizzas, its chefs encouraged LaDou to experiment with prosciutto, goat cheese, and truffles in their wood- burning oven, and send his results to guests. At one table, to whom he served an off-menu invention involving mustard, ricotta, p√¢t√©, and red pepper turned out to be chef Wolfgang Puck. Pizza topped with an egg from the Chez Panisse cafe By 1980, Alice Waters' Chez Panisse and its head chef, Jeremiah Tower, had already invented California cuisine, a combination of French and Italian techniques and presentation with fresh local ingredient-focused flavors. Waters was a long-time fan of Tommasso's Italian restaurant in San Francisco's North Beach, which had installed the West Coast's first wood-fired pizza oven when it opened in 1935. After traveling to Italy, Waters decided to make an open kitchen featuring a Tomasso's-style pizza oven the focus of the new cafe she was opening above her main dining room. Although prepared classically, her chefs added exotic fine ingredients to their single-serving pizzas and calzones, such as goat cheese and duck sausage. Her cafe, and its pizzas, in particular, were an instant success, attracting wide attention among food critics. Wolfgang Puck, in 1980 and 1981, was preparing to open the restaurant that would make him famous, Spago, in West Hollywood, California. Initially conceived as a pizzeria, Spago's was modeled after the upstairs cafe at Chez Panisse.. He was so impressed with the pizza LaDou had made for him at Prego, he hired LaDou as head pizza chef. Under Puck's guidance, LaDou developed more than 250 pizza concepts using ingredients such as scallops, roe, and baby zucchini flowers. Among their most famous invention was \\"Jewish pizza\\", a pizza dough first cooked then topped with smoked salmon, cr√®me fra√Æche, capers, and dill. Another innovation was using infused olive oil, baby vegetables, chili oil, and flavored dough. California-style pizza with greens, egg, bacon, and garden vegetables In 1985 LaDou helped two inexperienced lawyer-restaurateurs, Richard L. Rosenfeld and Larry S. Flax, start a new restaurant concept, California Pizza Kitchen (also known as \\"CPK\\"). He brought them many of Spago's recipes, which he had carefully saved. The new restaurant borrowed the concept of open kitchens centered around wood-burning pizza ovens from Spago, but instead of exotic gourmet ingredients, it used innovative but simpler comfort food toppings. When the new restaurant's chef quit less than a month before opening, LaDou quickly designed and cooked an entire menu, inventing the now-ubiquitous barbecue chicken pizza on the spot. LaDou also helped develop pizza menus for Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and the Hard Rock Cafe. ==Prominence== Both Wolfgang Puck and California Pizza Kitchen were instrumental in turning California-style pizza from a gourmet food trend to a mass consumer food product. Based on the success of his pizzas and his status as a celebrity chef, Puck opened a series of restaurants, ranging from high- end clones of Spago to convenience chains for airports and mall food courts. California Pizza Kitchen grew to 200 outlets. Both introduced frozen pizzas, but after an early success Puck's supermarket lines were overtaken by CPK's, which are backed by Kraft foods. ==See also== * Pizza in the United States * Chicago-style pizza * New York-style pizza ==References== Category:Food and drink introduced in 1980 Category:American pizza Category:California culture Category:Cuisine of the Western United States Category:Food and drink in California Category:Pizza varieties ","title":"California-style pizza"},{"id":"2220269","text":"The Alcuin Club is an Anglican organization seeking to preserve or restore church ceremony, arrangement, ornament, and practice in an orthodox manner.

It is directed by Shinichiro Kimura and Tetsuya Yanagisawa, with Kazuki Matsui handling series composition, Katsuz≈ç Hirata designing the characters and Toshio Masuda composing the music. The anime first aired on Wowow between July 6 and September 22, 2000, running for 10 episodes. An OVA was bundled with a DVD box set released on February 21, 2001. The series centers on the adventures of the main character, Kazuya Saotome, and a robotic Cyberdoll named May. Formerly available from Geneon in the United States, it is now out of print. ==Story== Kazuya Saotome is a nerdy second-year engineering student at . His lifelong dream is to build a Doraemon (robot), and is trying to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) robot that happens to look like a toy squid. The story begins when Kazuya's wealthy rival, Kotaro Nanbara, gives him a computer program that supposedly will provide valuable information to help with Kazuya's research and development. Actually, the program is a virus that Nanbara created in order to infect Kazuya's computer and destroy his work. While attempting to fix his infected computer, Kazuya accidentally orders a \\"cyberdoll\\" from the Cyberdyne Corporation website. A woman appears at Kazuya's door with a small package containing a cyberdoll named Hand Maid May. May is a palm-sized robotic doll who is very sensitive and sympathetic to Kazuya's feelings, likes, and needs. The early part of the storyline focuses on Nanbara trying to get May taken away from Kazuya due to his inability to pay for her. Nanbara enlists the help of several other cyberdolls to attempt to take May away from Kazuya, but all of them end up falling for Kazuya and failing to retrieve May. In the latter part of the anime, May is upgraded to a lifesize version of herself after Kazuya receives a visit from a mysterious visitor who wishes to promote Kazuya's artificial intelligence research. The situation complicates further when Kazuya's human friend Kasumi begins to get jealous of all the Cyberdolls flirting with Kazuya and they all compete to see who can go on a date with him. The last segment of the story deals with Kazuya and May having to deal with a virus which is shutting down all of the cyberdolls, and a couple of mysterious visitors who turn out to be related to Kazuya and Nanbara in the future. ==CharactersMain characters=== ; : :Kazuya is a 19-year-old electrical engineering student with a passion for building robots, primarily a robot squid which he calls Ikariya and implementing an AI system into it. He is a bit absent-minded and is clueless when it comes to girls. He has two sisters as shown in the 7th episode. However it is later revealed that in the future, his work with Ikariya will eventually become the basis for the M.a.i.d. Program (short for Meet Ai Departure, Ai means Love in Japanese). Kazuya lives in apartment 204 of Kasumi House. His life becomes more complicated but yet more satisfying after the arrival of cyberdoll May and the subsequent cyberdolls. ; : :A hand-sized 1/6 scale cyberdoll from the Cyberdyne Corporation (not to be confused with The Terminator's robotic company, Cyberdyne Systems). Kazuya receives May because of an accidental order which happened as a result of a revenge tactic planted in a DVD-RAM from his rival, Nanbara. She has to be plugged into Kazuya's computer via a homemade cable in order to recharge her batteries because May's official recharging equipment was accidentally broken when Kazuya first received her. May was never paid for by Kazuya, and thus became a target for Sara and Cyberdyne in early episodes. :As a cyberdoll, she can control traffic lights and simple electronics, and can connect to personal computers via what may or may not be USB cables. She later becomes a human- sized 17-year-old version (courtesy of Cyber-X) following her repossession. Her personality is innocent, and at times childish and naive, though she also shows surprising insight and is always able to cheer Kazuya up. Unlike the other cyberdolls, May's Maid Program had evolved (according to Kei during her analysis), making her more human and resistant to the retro-cybervirus that threatened the other cyberdolls. She shows strong feelings towards Kazuya and is often competing with Kasumi. In the last episode it has also been stated that she can give birth. ; : :Kasumi is the 18-year-old daughter of the owners of Kasumi House, a small wooden apartment building. Her window faces Kazuya's window, so she uses a long ladder that runs from his balcony to hers as a bridge to pay him a visit, along with Rena. Because she's a close friend of Kazuya's, she often lets him get away with overdue rent payments. In addition to being a college student, Kasumi is very active, athletic, and likes baseball. She is a coach for the local little league baseball team, and her uniform number is 33. She is shown to have a tomboyish side, as she refers to herself as \\"boku\\" (the Japanese male form of \\"I\\"), but she has a kind side. She has feelings for Kazuya and will wear more revealing outfits when coming to visit him. She sees the cyberdolls, primarily May, as a friendly rival for his affections. ; : :The self-proclaimed \\"best friend and worst enemy\\" of Kazuya Saotome. Nanbara is very rich with an eccentric, egomaniacal personality. He is jealous of being outdone in projects by the Kazuya. His virus caused Kazuya to inadvertently order May. Nanbara gets Sara to do his chores by offering ramen in exchange. Though very antagonistic against May in her smaller form in earlier episodes, he falls in love when she is enlarged to human size. It is later revealed that he and Kazuya will form the Cyberdyne Corporation that produces the Cyberdolls and will be run by their descendants. ===Cyberdolls=== ; : :Sara is a 23-year-old Cyberdoll from Cyberdyne's Customer Service division, she has tan skin, silver hair, pointed ears and wears a Chinese qipao. She is addicted to ramen and seems to have an endless stomach for it. Her goal early on is to repossess Cyberdoll May because Kazuya did not pay for her. She later develops a crush on Kazuya. ; : :Another Cyberdoll in the form of a 9-year-old child sent by Cyberdyne to recover May. She was first discovered by Kazuya and May as a lost child. Rena decides that she likes Kazuya and Ikariya, and therefore does not return May to Cyberdyne; instead she moves in with Kasumi. In the Japanese audio, she is referred to by everyone, including herself, as \\"Rena-chan.\\" She has the ability to produce supersonic screams. ; : :Kei is a 21-year-old genius Cyberdoll said to have an IQ of 50,000 in human terms. Kei is given the mission of formulating a strategy to get May back, but becomes interested in Kazuya after hearing how he regards Cyberdolls and changes her mind. Kei's memory bank of facts is extensive, but she often takes a while to process information that is more abstract. At times, abstract or philosophical questions can cause her CPU to lock up. She later develops a crush on Kazuya and takes up residence in his closet. ; : :Mami, age 31, is from Cyberdyne's American branch and is a combination of both Japanese and American cultures (she wears both a kimono and roller blades. She has the habit of saying when amazed or otherwise. She arrives later to help Kazuya around the house, and is gifted at domestic tasks which causes May to be jealous. Even so, Mami tries to pair Kazuya and May up. She is later revealed to be the caretaker of Kazuya's descendant Takuya Saotome. ===Cyberdyne Corporation=== ; / : :He is Kazuya's descendant. In his initial appearances he wears a red trenchcoat, white pants, and a yellow hat, and wears a type of muscle suit that covers his torso and arms with specifications (which is to hide his obese body). He also wears a specially- designed helmet that has an opening mouthpiece to eat or drink (especially milk which is his favorite). He first appears in the second episode watching over May, and in the same episode guides Kazuya (without his knowledge) to May who was lost in the city. He fully introduces himself in the 5th episode after May is repossessed. He shows interest in Kazuya's research with Artificial Intelligence, and allows Kazuya to choose a Cyberdoll for research. To Kazuya's request he arranges May to be returned to him and in a full-sized body as a bonus. His main ability lies in his incredibly fast typing skills, which even with only one hand was able to keep up with Kotaro's long and fast password. He is not fully unmasked until after the credits in the 10th episode, where he shown with green hair and wearing glasses with orange lens and red trim. ; / : :The so-called \\"Wandering President of Cyberdyne\\", Totaro is every bit as egomaniacal as his ancestor Kotaro, although he has a stronger streak of common sense. He normally wears a kind of scarlet bodysuit and cape (A reference to Kaiketsu Zubat), and makes a big production during his introductions (His introduction dialogue is very similar to Kaiketsu Zubat's). Apparently, he and Kazuya's descendant has formed a partnership in running Cyberdyne, with Takuya in research and development and Totaro handling the financial ends. He comes to Kotaro to warn him and Kazuya about the virus. ===The Whirlwind of Love cast=== ; / : ; / : ; / : ===Other characters=== ; : :A robotic squid and Kazuya's Doraemon Research Project.

The one end of the stick is steadily attached to the binocular while the other end rests against the belly. Finnsticks help to keep the binoculars steady especially when they are used for a prolonged time. In addition to keeping the image steady which allows for finer details of the object to be discerned, the use of the stick reduces muscle strain thus enabling longer viewing with less sore muscles afterwards. Some birdwatchers feel that the use of a finnstick does not markedly improve the viewer's ability to resolve detail, but rather improves viewing comfort and prevents premature fatigue. The finnstick is especially useful when watching migration (e.g. seabirds, raptors) when the horizon may be scanned literally for hours to find migrant birds. As the name implies the stick was invented by the Finns but is now also used in other countries, mainly in Europe. Alternative strategies for steadying the binoculars include supporting the arms against the body. Some birdwatchers have extended the idea by using a telescoping stick either as a finnstick or a monopod, depending on the situation. == Manufacture == A simple finnstick can be made from a piece of wood such as an old hockey stick, or from the leg of an old tripod. The upper end of the stick needs to be adjusted to each binocular model. In the cold Finnish climate it is common to cover finnsticks made of metal with an insulator to keep the hands warmer. Finnsticks are also commercially available and some binocular manufacturers provide an attachment for a finnstick (or a monopod) as an accessory. == References == *Collins, Walter S., 1993: \\"The Finnstick\\".

Mouse is the third in a children's novel trilogy by Beverly Cleary. It features Ralph, a mouse with the ability to speak, but only with certain people, who tend to be loners. It was first published in 1982, illustrated by Paul O. Zelinsky. A film adaptation was broadcast in the ABC Weekend Special series in 1991. == Plot summary == Ralph has befriended a young boy named Ryan, the son of the inn's new housekeeper. Ryan has given Ralph the full name of \\"Ralph S. Mouse\\", the middle initial standing for \\"Smart\\". Meanwhile, Ralph becomes agitated at his family, because he doesn't want them riding his motorcycle. Worried that their droppings on the floor will result in anti- mouse retaliation by the hotel staff, he asks Ryan to take him to school, where he plans to hide and live out the rest of his life. Ralph is discovered by Ryan's classmates, who adopt him as a class pet, and decide to see how smart he is by building a maze for him to run through. All this time, Ryan is having difficulty with an aggressive boy named Brad from his class, who accidentally breaks Ralph's motorcycle, and Ralph blames Ryan and runs away to hide in the school. However, Ralph also confronts Brad for breaking his motorcycle, and Brad, realizing that Ralph can talk, offers to set things right for both him and Ryan. Ryan and Brad discover that they have much in common, and become friends. Ryan reclaims Ralph, and brings him home on the school bus on the day that his new friend comes with him to visit at the inn. Brad also atones for his destruction of Ralph's treasured motorcycle by giving him a model \\"Laser XL7\\" sports car. Ralph discovers that he can't move the car by making the same noise as his motorcycle; he has to go \\"vroom-vroom\\" instead. Ralph further discovers that he can safely give his younger relatives rides in the car without worrying that they will be irresponsible with it (but only Ralph can drive the car). Brad's father meets Ryan's mother, and they marry six months later, thus Ryan and Brad are now step-brothers. == Series == * The Mouse and the Motorcycle (1965) * Runaway Ralph (1970) * Ralph S.

Calspan consists of four primary operating units: Flight Research, Transportation Research, Aerospace Sciences [Transonic Wind Tunnel], and Crash Investigations. The company's main facility is in Cheektowaga, New York, while it has other facilities such as the Flight Research Center in Niagara Falls, New York, and remote flight test operations at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and Patuxent River, Maryland. Calspan also has thirteen field offices throughout the Eastern United States which perform accident investigations on behalf of the United States Department of Transportation. ==History== The facility was started as a private defense contractor in the home front of World War II. As a part of its tax planning in the wake of the war effort, Curtiss-Wright donated the facility to Cornell University to operate \\"as a public trust\\" and received a charitable tax deduction. Seven other east coast aircraft companies also donated $675,000 to provide working capital for the lab. The lab operated under the name Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory from 1946 until 1972. During this same time, Cornell formed a new Graduate School of Aerospace Engineering on its Ithaca, New York campus. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, universities came under criticism for conducting war-related research particularly as the Vietnam War became unpopular, and Cornell University tried to sever its ties. Similar laboratories at other colleges, such as the Lincoln Laboratory and Draper Laboratory at MIT came under similar criticism, but some labs, such as Lincoln, retained their collegiate ties. Cornell accepted a $25 million offer from EDP Technology, Inc. to purchase the lab in 1968. However, a group of lab employees who had made a competing $15 million offer organized a lawsuit to block the sale. In May 1971, New York's highest court ruled that Cornell had the right to sell the lab. At the conclusion of the suit, EDP Technology could not raise the money, and in 1972, Cornell reorganized the lab as the for- profit \\"Calspan Corporation\\" and then sold its stock in Calspan to the public. Calspan was the first in a series of corporate owners that have included Arvin Industries, Space Industries International, Veridian Corporation and General Dynamics. In 2005, Calspan Corporation was returned to independent ownership when a local management group purchased the Aeronautics and Transportation Testing Groups of the Western New York operation from General Dynamics. Under the name of Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory were inventions of the first crash test dummy in 1948, the automotive seat belt in 1951, the first mobile field unit with Doppler weather radar for weather-tracking in 1956, the first accurate airborne simulation of another aircraft (the North American X-15) in 1960, the first successful demonstration of an automatic terrain-following radar system in 1964, the first use of a laser beam to successfully measure gas density in 1966, the first independent HYGE sled test facility to evaluate automotive restraint systems in 1967, the mytron, an instrument for research on neuromuscular behavior and disorders in 1969, and the prototype for the Federal Bureau of Investigation's fingerprint reading system in 1972. CAL served as an \\"honest broker\\" making objective comparisons of competing plans to build military hardware. It also conducted classified counter-insurgency research in Thailand for the Defense Department. By the time of its divestiture, CAL had 1,600 employees. Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory conducted wind tunnel tests on models of a number of skyscrapers, including the John Hancock Tower in Boston, Massachusetts. ==Products and services== Calspan offers a variety of products and services: === Aerospace === * Aircraft modifications and certification * Flight test services and airborne testbeds * Test pilot and flight training * In-flight simulation * Flight control and handling qualities * UAV surrogates * High-speed wind tunnel testing (up to 1,000 MPH) * Low-speed wind tunnel testing (up to 75 MPH) * Aerodynamic analysis and research * Subsonic/Transonic wind tunnel operation and maintenance * Calspan Air Services fixed-base operator services === Transportation === * Active safety research and testing * Autonomous vehicle research and testing * Crashworthiness and crash test * Safety research and data collection * Proving ground rental * Tire research and tire test * Sled test and impact simulation * Component and subsystem testing * Crash investigation * Accident re-creation and litigation support * Crash seminars * First responder training * Dummy rental * Dummy purchases * Dummy calibration services * Certification and homologation === General === * Consulting * Test services * High-speed video or camera rental * Instrumentation and electronic systems * Machining and fabrication * Test support and test management ==Airplanes== Calspan owns and operates a fleet of advanced experimental aircraft, including four Learjets, a Gulfstream G-III, a SAAB 340, and a Hawker-Beechcraft Bonanza aerobatic airplane. ==References * Calspan Corporation website ==Further reading== * Cornell Research Has Great Freedom. // Aviation Week, June 3, 1957, v. 66, no. 22, PP. 290-303.

This conference served many high schools located in Cass, Hamilton, Howard, and Miami Counties. The conference dissolved at the end on the 2014-15 academic school year. ==History== The Mid-Indiana Conference can trace its roots back to the late 1940s, when school consolidation reduced the Howard County Conference from nine schools to three in the matter of three years. These three remaining schools joined three nearby schools from Miami County and began the new Howard-Miami Conference. The conference renamed itself the Tri-County Conference in 1955, as two schools from Grant County joined. Further school consolidation reduced membership to four schools by 1965, forcing the conference to reach out of its footprint to find similar-sized schools. This expansion also brought with it the change to its current and final name. Though only one member has consolidated since the MIC name has taken hold, geography, size differences, and competitiveness have all caused various roster changes through the years, with membership as many as nine schools and as few as six. However, membership stabilized after 2000, when Hamilton Heights joined from the folding Rangeline Conference. This ended in 2015, as Eastern and Taylor elected to join an expanding Hoosier Heartland Conference. Maconaquah and Peru are also leaving to join the Three Rivers Conference, while the four remaining schools are off to the Hoosier Athletic Conference. ==Membership== {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !

It was founded in 1971 by Paolo Lugari who assembled a group of engineers and scientists in an attempt to create a mode of sustainable living in one of the least hospitable political and geographical climates in South America. == Technology == The community has produced a number of inventions and innovations over the years - notably including a children's seesaw that drives a water pump and a \\"distinctive 'sunflower' design\\" windmill that is well-suited to the plains in Colombia. Lugari notes that social experiments cannot simply import solutions from temperate climates. Gaviotas has made it a goal to always engineer solutions specific to the problems the community will be facing personally (Gaviotas Rising 1994). Since already-existing solutions are often very costly to adapt, Gaviotas' innovations are often simple changes to a means of production that make otherwise expensive products available at affordable prices. One of the most widespread Gaviotas developments is a water pump that can tap aquifers six times as deep as conventional pumps with less effort being expended. While existing pumps in the region raised and lowered a heavy piston in a pipe, the Gaviotas engineers created pumps that leave the piston in place and instead lift and lower a cheap, light PVC sleeve around the piston (Weisman 1995). When leading solar hot water panel manufacturers explained the expenses and complicated manufacture of panels efficient enough to collect sunlight in the often overcast weather of the llanos, the Gaviotas engineers crafted homemade solar water-heating panels out of cheap building materials that were better suited to the peculiar climate of the region. The ecovillage also creates some of its own building materials like a unique form of quickcrete brick made with the dirt of the region. == Gaviotas Day == In the spring of 1998, Alan Weisman, the author of the book Gaviotas came and visited the students of Communications Arts High School in San Antonio, Texas, in what would later become known as 'Gaviotas Day.' == Healthcare advances == The Gaviotas crew created a self-powered, functional hospital in 1980 which treated a substantial number of indigenous people who worked in the village as well as those in the outlying plains until the Colombian government passed legislation pressuring the hospital to close its doors in the 1990s. While the hospital is no longer operational, the application of Gaviotas pump technology in the surrounding region has increased the availability of clean water and is a reportedly effective form of disease prevention as long as the locals maintain the pumps (Weisman 1999). == Environmental impact == It is estimated that, in pre-Columbian times, the llanos were an extension of the Amazonian rain forest, but the rainforest border has been receding from the area for centuries. The Gaviotas village is noted for the planting of over 1.5 million trees in the area. While the trees were originally part of an experiment to see if any significant growth could occur in the desiccated soil of the llanos, they have become a significant feature of the grasslands. As a result of the shade these trees provide and the tropical climate of the area, the groundcover began hosting tropical rainforest species which are native to the region. Resin harvested from the planted trees has provided Gaviotas with a sustainable source of income. While the village is largely self-sufficient, it regularly uses diesel fuel during certain seasons. Currently, a BioDiesel project is under way for market and local use. ==Climate History == Gaviotas' pragmatic approach to its survival disassociates the village from many philosophies and political ideologies. Originally, the project received funding from the United Nations and similar groups seeking environmentally friendly solutions to population growth and Third World development. When these original donors began to pull funding from Gaviotas in the 1990s, the villagers looked elsewhere for their income. They realized that the impressive pine forest was a sustainable source of pine resin used in the production of a wide variety of products like turpentine and violins. Their terraformation of the llanos allows Gaviotas to thrive, but it is not an example of low impact ecology practised by many eco-villages. Gaviotas is largely apolitical, a strategy which has allowed it to grow amidst the cocaine growers, paramilitary and insurgent guerrilla groups, and military troops present in the llanos. The village is further separated from many eco-anarchist movements because of its early ties to the United Nations and the Colombian government. == References  * *\\"Friends of Gaviotas\\" ===Books=== * *Weisman, Alan.

It is based in Ramsey, New Jersey. ==History and profile== Latin Mass Magazine was established in 1992. Published by the Catholic organization Keep the Faith, the magazine is a strong supporter of the traditional Tridentine Mass and has often expressed skepticism about the liturgical and other reforms introduced by the Second Vatican Council and Popes John XXIII and Paul VI. The magazine admires Pope Benedict XVI because of his emphasis on traditional Catholic dogma and apparent desire to widen the use of the Tridentine Mass in the church. The magazine claims to be \\"one of the fastest growing Catholic periodicals in the country.\\". In an interview with The Wanderer, a Catholic weekly newspaper, former publisher Roger McCaffrey claimed: \\"In 10 years, the circulation of Latin Mass Magazine will be higher than that of America.\\" According to its mission statement, the magazine attempts to combat what it sees as \\"accelerating secularism\\" by emphasizing a \\"return of the Church to tradition and authentic organic development\\". The magazine also holds conferences to encourage conservative priests and laity in furthering a more traditional approach to Catholic teaching and liturgy, and it hopes to establish a study center \\"that will assist the articulation of Catholic tradition\\". The magazine's most recent managing editor was John W. Blewett, who died February 8, 2013. The publication has seen occasional controversy, such as its dispute with The Wanderer over Humanae Vitae, Paul VI's encyclical on birth control. ==References * Latin Mass Magazine website * Page on Latin Mass Magazine at Keep the Faith website Category:1992 establishments in New Jersey Category:Quarterly magazines published in the United States Category:Religious magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1992 Category:Magazines published in New Jersey Category:Traditionalist Catholic magazines ","title":"Latin Mass Magazine"},{"id":"2220347","text":"Yoshitoshi can refer to several things: * For the Japanese woodblock print artist Tsukioka Yoshitoshi, see Yoshitoshi. * For the Japanese graphic artist, see Yoshitoshi ABe. * For the house music label owned and operated by Deep Dish, see Yoshitoshi Recordings.

On that date it was granted the status of pontifical right by decree, titled \\"Saeculorum Rex\\", of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei, on the occasion of the visit of Camille Perl, vice-president of the commission. Deacons and priests are incardinated into the institute, whose prior general has the right to call to orders. The institute is currently based in Gricigliano, Italy, in the Archdiocese of Florence. The international seminary of St. Philip Neri is also located there. Wach currently serves as prior general and Mora as rector of the seminary. Both received their priestly formation under Cardinal Giuseppe Siri of Genoa. As of 2018 the institute numbered 114 priests. The Institute also includes clerical oblates, who go through formation but are not ordained as priests, and who help in the several apostolates of the Institute. The charism of the institute is based on the example of its three patron saints: *Saint Francis de Sales, who emphasized teaching the Catholic faith with patience and charity, and encouraging all Catholics to seek a life of holiness through the ordinary means of the church, such as devout attendance at Mass and frequent confession. *Saint Benedict, with his love for the solemn celebration of the liturgy, his emphasis on work and prayer, his \\"Benedictine hospitality\\", and his role in laying the groundwork for an integral Christian civilization in medieval Europe. *Saint Thomas Aquinas, with his emphasis on the harmony between faith and reason. The institute also honors as its primary patroness the Virgin Mary under the title of the Immaculate Conception. St. Th√©r√®se of the Child Jesus is the patroness of its African missions. ==Apostolates== In the United States, the institute is located in Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio with its national headquarters in Chicago. In Chicago, the institute is restoring the historic St. Clara/St. Gelasius Church on Carmelite Way. Upon completion it will become the Shrine of Christ the King. Its oldest United States apostolate is St. Mary Oratory in Rockford, Illinois, and its newest is Most Precious Blood of Jesus parish in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In Kansas City, Missouri, in 2005, Bishop Robert Finn established an oratory (a public church where the Mass and other rites may be administered) for the institute at a historic church otherwise in danger of being closed. The superior for the United States is Canon Matthew Talarico. The Crescent showing Jesuits Church, Limerick The institute is active in the dioceses of Liverpool, Lancaster, Shrewsbury and East Anglia in Great Britain; in 2011 the Bishop of Shrewsbury invited the institute to re-open the church of Saints Peter, Paul and Philomena in New Brighton. Since St. Patrick's Day, 17 March 2006, the institute has had a presence in the Diocese of Limerick in the Republic of Ireland. In Limerick they purchased Sacred Heart Church, Since May 2010, the institute in Ireland has expanded into the diocese of Galway where weekly Mass is offered at St Mary on the Hill, Claddagh. Monthly Masses are offered by priests of the Institute in Ennis every first Sunday of the month and in Belfast every second Sunday of the month. The Institute is closely involved in the annual Catholic Voice conference held in Limerick which features amongst its regular speakers Cardinal Burke and Fr. John Hunwicke. In addition to its oratories in the United States and missions in Africa, the institute also has apostolates in France, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The institute is especially active in the domain of education, running schools in France (Montpellier, Lille and Versailles), Belgium (Brussels International Catholic School), and Africa. During its yearly ordinations week in Italy, the institute has had visits by Cardinals Raymond Leo Burke, Antonio Ca√±izares Llovera, Dar√≠o Castrill√≥n Hoyos, Giuseppe Siri and Archbishop Camille Perl. ==Sisters Adorers of the Royal Heart of Jesus== The Adorers of the Royal Heart of Jesus Christ Sovereign Priest are a women's community (founded in 2001) associated with the institute. They are also based in Gricigliano. The sisters are non-cloistered contemplatives, and their way of life is based on the Benedictine tradition. The community celebrates Mass and the Divine Office using the traditional Roman Rite. When the number of sisters has increased sufficiently, the community plans to locate convents near the institute's churches, where the sisters will perform apostolic work such as teaching. , the sisters numbered 42. The sisters have established a presence in Germany. Mass and the Divine Office celebrated in the pre-Vatican II Roman form, form the rhythm of each day. Needlework and embroidery projects form an important part of their daily \\"Ora et Labora\\" (\\"pray and work\\"). ==Society of the Sacred Heart== The Society of the Sacred Heart is a lay society associated with the Institute of Christ the King. The lay members of the society pledge to live according to a modified Benedictine rule, within their vocation. Through membership in the society, lay faithful participate in the spiritual and social missions of the institute through prayer, devotions, spiritual direction, and study of the spiritual writings of St. Francis de Sales. ==Superiors== Gilles Wach is the founder and prior general. Philippe Mora is the co-founder and rector of the international St. Philip Neri seminary in Gricigliano. Rudolf Michael Schmitz is the vicar general of the institute and provincial of the German-speaking countries. ==Choir dress== The institute has its own choir dress, adopted in 2006, which it received from Cardinal Ennio Antonelli, Archbishop of Florence.

Copper- engraved map, London ca. 1770 Map of the world based on Herodotus' Histories. The Melanchlaeni are in the northernmost part of the world, between the Celts and the Scythians Melanchlaeni (, meaning \\"black-cloaks\\") may refer to three ancient tribes. The first was a nomad tribe, the name of which first appears in Hecataeus (ap. Steph. B., Fr. 154, ed. Klausen). In the geography of Herodotus (iv. 20,100--103,107) they are found occupying the districts east of the Androphagi, and north of the Royal Scythians, 20 days' journey from the Palus Maeotis; over above them were lakes and lands unknown to man. It has been conjectured that Herodotus may refer, through some hearsay statement, to the lakes Ladoga and Onega. There has been considerable discussion among geographers as to the position which should be assigned to this tribe: it is of course impossible to fix this with any accuracy; but there would seem to be reason to place them as far north as the sources of the Volga, or even further. (Schafarik, Slav. Alt. vol. i. p. 295.) Herodotus expressly says that they did not belong to the Scythian-Scolotic stock, although their customs were the same. The name, the Black-cloaks, like that of their cannibal neighbours, the Anthropophagi, was applied to them by the Greeks, and was not a corrupted form of any indigenous appellation. The second people bearing this name is mentioned by Scylax of Caryanda (p. 32) as a tribe of Pontus. Pomponius Mela (i. 19. ¬ß 4) and Pliny (vi. 5) coincide with Scylax, who speaks of two rivers flowing through their territory, the Metasoris (ŒúŒµœÑŒ¨œÉœâœÅŒπœÇ), probably the same as the Thessyris (ŒòŒ≠œÉœÉœÖœÅŒπœÇ, Ptol. v. 9. ¬ß ¬ß 10, 30: Kamisiliar), and the Aegipius (Œë·º∞Œ≥ŒØœÄŒπŒøœÇ: Kentichli). Dionysius Periegetes (v. 309) places this people (or perhaps confuses the prior) on the Borysthenes, and Ptolemy (v. 9. ¬ß 19) between the river Rha and the Hippici Montes, in Asiatic Sarmatia; but it would be a great error to found any observation concerning these ancient northern tribes upon either the Roman writers or Ptolemy, or to confuse the picture set before us by these geographers, and the more correct delineations of Herodotus. The third people were the Melanchlaeni of Ammianus (xxii. 8. ¬ß 31), which were the Alani. ==See also== *European Scythian campaign of Darius I ==References== Category:Ancient peoples of Russia Category:Pontus (region) ","title":"Melanchlaeni"},{"id":"2220365","text":"Dilbert Dunker in Naval Air Station Whidbey Island now replaced by a newer system for egress training The Dilbert Dunker is a device for training pilots on how to correctly escape a submerged plane. It was invented by Ensign Wilfred Kaneb, an aviation engineer at NAS Pensacola, in 1943‚Äì1944. Originally named the \\"Underwater Cockpit Escape Device,\\" the device was known since its earliest days as the \\"Dilbert Dunker\\" in reference to Dilbert Groundloop, a World War II-era cartoon character in Navy aviation training videos and posters who is incapable of doing things right. The original Dilbert Dunker combined the forward fuselage of an SNJ Texan‚Äîincluding \\"all equipment in the cockpit that would hinder a pilot‚Äôs exit\\" (instrument panel, stick, and pedals)‚Äîwith a 45 degree rail that sends the cockpit from a high stand at the deep end of the training pool, and at the end of the run under water it flips inverted to simulate a water ditching. The cockpit would hit the water at before inverting. The preflight student must detach the communication wire from the helmet, release the seat and shoulder harness, dive still deeper and swim away from the \\"aircraft\\" at a 45 degree angle to the surface for the purpose of assuming that the water around an actual situation has burning fuel on the water's surface. The Dunker was still in use as of 1997, and a helicopter-specific version remains in service even though the original version has fallen out of service. ==In popular culture== The device was featured in the 1982 film, An Officer and a Gentleman, starring Richard Gere and Debra Winger. The device is used as a test for astronauts in the novel The Calculating Stars by Mary Robinette Kowal. ==References== Category:Flight training Category:Survival training ","title":"Dilbert Dunker"},{"id":"2220366","text":"Scrotoplasty, also known as oscheoplasty, is surgery to repair or create a scrotum. Some transgender men, intersex, and nonbinary people who were assigned female at birth may choose to have this surgery to create a scrotum, as part of their transition. This can be done together with closing the vagina (vaginectomy), having surgical changes made to their clitoris to make it more penis-like (metoidioplasty), and/or building a full-size penis (phalloplasty). It is possible to create a scrotum and keep the vagina, and there are trans people who have done so. == Procedure == Typically, when a trans man or transmasculine person has a scrotoplasty, the labia majora (the big lips of the vulva) are dissected to form hollow cavities, and united to into an approximation of a scrotum. If there is not enough skin to make a scrotum, then the surgeon may use some sort of tissue expansion prior to the operation. This can be done by putting expanders under the skin. Over the course of a few months, more saltwater (saline) will be occasionally added to the expanders through a port on the outside. This helps the skin expand and grow more skin. Each expansion procedure is done in an outpatient hospital visit. The patient does not have to stay overnight in the hospital, but will have to stay near the hospital, and return several times.Laura Erickson-Schroth, ed. Trans Bodies, Trans Selves: A Resource for the Transgender Community. Oxford University Press, 2014. P. 282. Later, silicone prosthetic testicles can be put in. These can be inserted through small cuts to fill the new scrotum. If expanders were used, they are no longer needed by this point. Then the skin is closed up around the artificial testicles. Artificial testicles only give a shape, and they do not create semen, sperm, or hormones. With today's technology, it is not yet possible to create testicles that do so. == Complications == Known complications to scrotoplasty primarily deal with testicular implants. If they are too big, there is chance that the implants could feel uncomfortable, or be a cause of chronic pain. Another complication is that the implant could erode the skin of the scrotum. This can cause infection, or an unwanted hole (a fistula) where the implant may work its way outside the body. Other complications are those that are typical for any surgery, such as blood loss, infection, or problems with anesthesia. == Cost == A scrotoplasty for a trans man or transmasculine person typically costs around USD$3,000 to $5,000. These costs can be covered by health insurance, though the patient must communicate a great deal with their insurance in order to make certain that it will. == See also == * Sex reassignment surgery (female-to-male) ==References== *Use of the Scrotal Remnant as a Tissue- Expanding Musculocutaneous Flap for Scrotal Reconstruction in Paget's Disease by Por, Yong-Chen; Tan, Bien-Keem; Hong, Soo-Wan; Chia, Sing-Joo; al ect.

According to the stories, he was a wandering minstrel who became a member of Robin's band of outlaws, the \\"Merry Men\\". He is a relatively late addition to the legend; he first appeared in a 17th-century broadside ballad, Child Ballad 138, \\"Robin Hood and Allen a Dale\\", and, unlike many of the characters thus associated, managed to adhere to the legend. In this tale, Robin rescues Alan's sweetheart from an unwanted marriage to an old knight. They stop the bishop from proceeding with the ceremony, and Robin Hood, dressed in the bishop's robes, marries Alan to his bride. In other versions it is Little John or Friar Tuck that performs the ceremony.Holt, J. C. Robin Hood p 165 (1982) Thames & Hudson. Another variant appears in which the hero is not Alan but Will Scarlet, but Alan has taken over the role completely. Howard Pyle uses this tale in his book The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, but changes several details. He gives Alan's sweetheart the name Ellen, and introduces Friar Tuck into the story; Tuck is sought out specifically as the only priest who will perform the wedding in defiance of the bishop, and therefore, this tale is combined with that of Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar.Michael Patrick Hearn, \\"Afterword\\", Howard Pyle The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, p 384 In Pierce Egan the Younger's story Robin Hood and Little John, Alan is given the name Sir Allan Clare; he is an armed knight, not a minstrel, and he is the brother of the Maid Marian. His sweetheart is Lady Christabel, the daughter of the Sheriff of Nottingham, who wants to give her to an old knight friend of his. The \\"Allan-a-Dale\\" name is given to his estates in Sherwood Forest; he is not given a major role after he and Christabel are married by Little John (who takes the place of the Bishop of Hereford), though he helps the Merry Men from time to time.Pierce Egan the Younger \\"Robin Hood and Little John of the Merry Men of Sherwood Forest\\", Alan plays a prominent role in some later plays, children's novels, films, and television shows. ==Modern incarnations== *Alan-a-Dale was played by Lloyd Talman in Robin Hood (1922). *Alan-a-Dale is absent from The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) but is merged with the character Will Scarlet portrayed by Patric Knowles. *Alan-a-Dale was played by Leslie Denison in The Bandit of Sherwood Forest (1946). *Alan-a-Dale was played by Lester Matthews in Rogues of Sherwood Forest (1950). *Alan-a-Dale is played by Elton Hayes in the 1952 film The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men. *Alan-a-Dale was played by John Schlesinger in two episodes of Robin Hood (1956). *Alan-a-Dale is the musical narrator of Disney's 1973 animated Robin Hood film. He is depicted as a lute-playing rooster voiced by country singer Roger Miller and played the role of both narrator and minor ally to Robin Hood and Little John. The songs are \\"Whistle Stop\\", \\"Oo-De-Lally\\", and \\"Not in Nottingham\\". *Alan Dale is the main character in Angus Donald's novels Outlaw, Holy Warrior and King's Man. *Alan-a-Dale was played by Elric Hooper in Lionel Bart's ill-fated musical, Twang!! (1965). The show was revived in 2018 at the Union Theatre, London, with James Hudson in the role. *Alan A 'Dale was the subject of a comic song performed on Dudley Moore and Peter Cook's show, Not Only But Also in 1965. The lyrics consisted of little more than a repetition of his name. Along with Cook and Moore, the performers were Joe Melia, Bill Wallis and John Wells. *He was played by Bing Crosby in the rat pack film Robin and the 7 Hoods. *Robert O. Cornthwaite played Allan A. Dale, an accomplice to the supervillain The Archer, in season 2 of Batman (Shoot a Crooked Arrow and Walk the Straight and Narrow, 1966). *He was played by Peter Hutchinson in the 1984 British television series Robin of Sherwood, appearing in the fifth episode, entitled \\"Alan A Dale\\". In this version, Alan's sweetheart is named Mildred and is to be married to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Friar Tuck weds Alan and Mildred. *In the animated series Young Robin Hood, Alan-a-Dale (Voiced by Michael O'Reilly) is a very young, romantic minstrel and good friend of Robin. *In the 2002 video game Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood, Allan appears briefly to disguise himself as Prince John's man Guillame de Longchamps to deliver the ransom to save King Richard. *LeVar Burton's character Geordi La Forge was cast as Alan-a-Dale in a Robin Hood fantasy episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. *Allan A Dale is played by Joe Armstrong in the 2006 BBC production of Robin Hood.

Released in Japan in 1999 and in North America and Europe in 2000, the game is part of the Mega Man Legends (Rockman DASH) series. It is also a prequel and spin-off of the first Legends game. Rather than focusing on the heroic protagonists of Mega Man Legends series, the game follows series antihero Tron Bonne, sister of the criminal Bonne family of air pirates. The Japanese counterpart included PocketStation support whereas the North American and European version did not. ==Gameplay== Unlike other games in the Mega Man series, MTB bears three distinct play styles, each related to a specific mission. Players are tasked with completing (with gradual difficulty) \\"moving-box\\" puzzle stages (containers of various contents in Teche and Primiki Harbor), a Descent-like adventure stage, and several action stages similar to the remainder of the Mega Man Legends series (robbing a bank near Gold City and exploring the Nakkai Ruins themselves). Another gameplay aspect is a collection mission built into one of the action missions, located in Sart Farm, where you must gather pigs, cows and horses. Players can choose freely among the three stage types at any time, but each level may only be cleared once. The only exception is the Nakkai Ruins, which can be explored anytime, however the player may only collect Diana's Tear (by defeating the boss) once (afterwards the boss room will be empty). Instrumental in the game's story is the interaction between Tron and her army of forty loyal Servbots. Each Servbot is given a personality and a few other traits, and the player's investigation and interaction is rewarded with money for the loan, additional parts and weapons for the Gustaff, or other assistance. Servbots also play a role during the adventure and action stages (limited to seven, three or one, depending on the type, generally one leading the others, and called \\"sniper\\"), assisting Tron in her quest by ransacking houses or defeating minor threats as the situation and their individual skills warrant. A Servbot's skills may be increased by putting him through training exercises (attack and speed), going on missions (brains) or by disciplining him in the Torture Room (thus lowering the sloth level); in both cases, the effect of the action is determined by a minigame. Some Servbots learn their special skill once their skills reach a high enough level, whilst others learn it as soon as they're given a certain special item. ==Plot== The family's leader, Teisel Bonne, seeks an ancient ruin (the Nakkai Ruins) to try and uncover a gigantic and highly valuable Refractor (Diana's Tear). He has a short rendezvous with Bon Bonne, but he and Bon are quickly subdued and captured by Glyde, a rival air pirate in the service of Mr. Loath. Tron finds out that the money used to build the Bonnes' flying fortress was funded by Mr. Loath, and can only watch helplessly, having chosen to act as Spotter for the mission. After discovering that Teisel defaulted on his 1,000,000 zenny loan, she realises that she has no choice but to pay off the loan, or Teisel and Bon will not be seen again. Seeing no other options, Tron suits up in a custom Gustaff mecha and, along with her army of 40 identical Servbots, begins her quest to pay the ransom through any means possible; especially by theft. During repeated bank robberies, Tron meets (and to an extent, befriends) officer Denise Marmalade, who repeatedly fails to stop her, even when engaging Tron in her own police-issue mecha. In the caves, the Servbots find the three Aurora Stones, help the restless spirit of a man that died trying to find the Fountain of Youth (which was, in fact, a primitive form of root beer), and help two Diggers fall in love. And in the ruins, Tron explores for valuable artifacts, including Diana's Tear (which Teisel was meant to find). After various adventures, Tron brings the one million zenny to Mr. Loath, who then claims that Teisel also owes interest on his loan, to the sum of two million zenny. She proceeds to acquire the requested money, and is then told that she owes interest on the interest. Realizing that Loath will never let Teisel and Bon go, she too is captured and placed in Teisel's cell. At this point, the player takes control of their Favorite Servbot (who has the distinctive \\"red head parts\\"), who sets off on a rescue mission. Though the Favorite Servbot succeeds in freeing Teisel, Tron, and Bon Bonne, and then defeating Glyde, Loath is still able to activate his secret weapon: the Colossus. The Bonnes at first try to attack it with the Gesselschaft's weapons, but this has almost no effect, and the Colossus' return fire causes Tron to be very seriously injured and Teisel to get thrown overboard. Thus, the Favorite Servbot and his Servbot crew have to take on the Colossus in the Gustaff. They succeed, finally defeating Loath and Glyde once and for all. And to ensure they never cause trouble again, Tron hands them into the police, saving officer Denise's job in the process (as she gets given the credit for catching them). The issue finally resolved, the Bonnes, reunited, set off for Kattelox Island. While in flight, the Favorite Servbot accidentally throws out a giant Refractor won from Loath with the trash, causing Tron and Teisel to freak out and force a pit stop to search for it. At this point, the events of Mega Man Legends takes place. ==Development== The Misadventures of Tron Bonne was first revealed in December 1998. A Capcom representative said that although a release was not confirmed yet, the staff would to announce it in a short time due to the popularity of the first Mega Man Legends game. In June 1999, Capcom announced that Tron Ni Kobun would come packed with a trial demo version of the then- upcoming Rockman DASH 2 (Mega Man Legends 2). The demo was meant to provide better graphics and a larger scale universe. According to the official Japanese Rockman DASH website by Capcom, the Japanese demo isn't by any means a prototype, but an adventure \\"completely independent\\" from the final retail product of the game. The demo is known as Rockman DASH 2: Episode 1 ~ Roll- chan Kiki Ippatsu!. The demo included in the North American version would much more closely resemble the final content of the game, consisting of three selectable events, two being boss fights (against Tron's crabbot and a giant ape-ish Reaverbot, which can be considered as \\"easy\\" and \\"hard\\", respectively) and the last one the full exploration of the Forbidden Ruins). The game has the same voice acting from the rest of the other Legends games for its main characters. In the North American version, Tron Bonne is voiced by Caroly Larson, while Teisel is voiced by Rob Smith (Tessh≈ç Genda in Japan). This is the only game in the Legends series where Ikue ≈åtani does not provide Bon Bonne's voice for the North American version. The Japanese version of the game features two vocal songs, \\"Love Letter\\" and \\"Magic!\\", both sung by Mayumi Iizuka, Tron Bonne's Japanese voice actress. ==Reception== The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Jeff Lundrigan of Next Generation said in an early review, \\"This is not a game that's neatly pigeonholed as anything, whether by game genre, or by approach, which as far as we're concerned is reason enough to like it. The bonus is that it also happens to be terrific.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 27 out of 40. According to Media Create sales information, The Misadventures of Tron Bonne was the 212th best-selling video game in Japan in 1999 at 61,127 copies sold. Eidos reported light sales of the game, among other releases, for its first quarter financial results ending June 30, 2000. In a 2007 retrospective of the Mega Man series, Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com ranked The Misadventures of Tron Bonne as \\"Worth it!\\", with comments focused on the gameplay and the playable characters. GameSpot called it a \\"bridge\\" between Mega Man Legends and its sequel and that some fans would not find it appealing. ==NotesReferences * Official website * * Category:1999 video games Category:Mega Man Legends Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video game prequels Category:Cancelled Nintendo 64 games Category:Video games with cel- shaded animation ","title":"The Misadventures of Tron Bonne"},{"id":"2220403","text":"The O'Reilly Auto Parts 500 is a NASCAR Cup Series stock car race held at Texas Motor Speedway (TMS) in Fort Worth, Texas. Even though it is advertised as a \\"500-mile\\" race, because TMS is a track that is in length, the actual race distance is . Austin Dillon is the defending race winner. ==Race history== The first two runnings of the race were controversial, crash-strewn affairs, with universal criticism that the track's design was one groove; Kenny Wallace argued, \\"They're so busy building condos they don't have time to fix the racetrack.\\" There were ten different winners in the first ten races, the longest such streak for any NASCAR track in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. This list includes Texas Native Terry Labonte, who won in 1999, and Dale Earnhardt Jr winning his first race in 2000. Jeff Burton, the winner of the inaugural race, broke that streak by getting his second Texas win in a last lap pass in 2007. In 2011, the race became a Saturday night event, whereas before it was always a Sunday afternoon race. This was done since the night race at Phoenix was moved to February and became a day race. The 2011 race was run on April 9, 2011 and was the first scheduled night race of the season, and in Texas Motor Speedway history for the Cup Series. In 2013, NASCAR became involved in controversy when the National Rifle Association (NRA) began to sponsor the race; although race sponsorships are negotiated with the track owner, not NASCAR itself, the sanctioning organization has final approval and did not object to the sponsorship. Both NASCAR's acceptance of this sponsorship, and its timing, has been controversial, and offensive to gun control activists. Because of the sponsorship, Senator Chris Murphy asked Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns Fox Sports, which was scheduled to air the race, to not broadcast it. Fox broadcast the race as scheduled, not least because failure to do so would have been a breach of the network's contract with NASCAR. However, Fox only used the official sponsored name once per hour (the minimum mandated by NASCAR) and otherwise referred to it generically (in this case as the \\"Texas 500\\"), the network's usual practice when a race's title sponsor does not buy ads during the race broadcast; the NRA reportedly did not seek to purchase any such ads. The NRA would return as a race sponsor in 2016 for the Bristol Night Race in August at Speedway's owned Bristol Motor Speedway. In 2014, the race returned to being a Sunday afternoon race because of the NCAA Men's basketball Final Four games being held at AT&T; Stadium in nearby Arlington, so that the race occurs on a day in between tournament games.\\"Texas Motor Speedway alters race schedule with NCAA Final Four in Dallas\\" On February 6, 2014, Duck Commander, the business that is the subject of the TV show Duck Dynasty, bought the naming rights for the race. The race returned to its Saturday night date in 2015. In 2017, the race would once again return to Sunday afternoon and the race was renamed under a new sponsorship deal with O'Reilly Auto Parts. Since 2002, the trophy awarded to the winner has been cowboy boots, a white cowboy hat, and a pair of six- shooters to fire off in victory lane. The winner of the event, and the same goes for the Fall race, bolts their name onto a Wall of Champions that has their name engraved on a plate using a laser engraver. ===Grandfather clause=== Samsung sponsored the race from 2002 to 2012, while RadioShack was previously a co-sponsor. The joint sponsorship was grandfathered in 2003 by NASCAR's grandfather clause when Nextel became a NASCAR sponsor, as they banned rival wireless sponsorships (Nextel used Motorola exclusively); the ban was lifted after the 2005 merger of Sprint and Nextel because Sprint is sold at RadioShack, and Sprint offers Samsung products. ==Past winners== {  style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Date ! rowspan=\\"2\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Driver ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Team ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Manufacturer ! colspan=\\"2\\"Race Distance ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Race Time ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Average Speed (mph) ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Report - !

The inaugural race took place on November 6, 2005. The race has always started in the late afternoon, gone through sunset and twilight, and ended under the lights at night, much like the Coca-Cola 600 in May, but it is not considered a night event. The race is held on the first weekend in November each year; TMS has expressed interest in changing the date, which is also the opening weekend of deer hunting season in Texas. However in 2020, the race will be run one week earlier around Halloween. The race was acquired as a result of the Ferko lawsuit, which forced NASCAR to relinquish the sport's fourth major, the Mountain Dew Southern 500 and in the process end its Grand Slam, as the Southern 500 was one of the four races that made it up. This race has been derisively referred to as the Francis Ferko 500, mostly by traditionalist fans upset by the demise of the Southern 500. The trophy is in the shape of a cowboy hat on top of a piston. Traditionally, the winning driver wears a black cowboy hat and fires a couple of six-shooters in the air on victory lane. This race is featured in the 2006 film Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, but it was actually shot at the identically shaped Charlotte Motor Speedway with the wall painted to look like Texas. Kevin Harvick is the defending winner of the event having won it the last three years in 2017, 2018 and 2019. ==Past winners== {  style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Date ! rowspan=\\"2\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Driver ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Team ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Manufacturer ! colspan=\\"2\\"Race Distance ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Race Time ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Average Speed (mph) ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Report - !

Coming down to fuel mileage, Kyle had led 232 laps and was on his way to a dominant win until he ran out with less than 3 to go. Brother Kurt led 89 laps, and was able to stretch his gas tank to win the event by over 25 seconds as others were running out of gas. Aside from the Busch brothers, only Denny Hamlin (2 laps led) and Jeff Gordon (11 laps led) led laps. *2010: Denny Hamlin became the second driver to sweep both races at Texas when he won the Samsung Mobile 500 and the AAA Texas 500. Also, around mid-race, a shoving match occurred when Jeff Burton and Jeff Gordon crashed in turn 2. *2012: The first 100 laps of the race went green, combine that with the last 234 laps of the April 2012 race that went green, means a total of 334 consecutive laps were run caution free, a full scheduled race at Texas. Jimmie Johnson won, for his 60th NASCAR Cup Series win, and also Chevrolet's 700th win. *2013: Johnson's second consecutive fall win makes him Texas Motor Speedway's second 3-time winner, putting him in a tie with Carl Edwards. *2014: Johnson took his third straight win in the fall race, leading 191 of 341 laps. On a green-white checkered restart, Brad Keselowski tried to go three-wide and made contact with Jeff Gordon, cutting Gordon's left rear tire and causing him to spin in turn 4. Gordon lost a lap and finished 29th while Keselowski finished third. Tempers boiled over, escalating into a post-race brawl on pit road between Keselowski, Gordon, and their pit crews that was apparently instigated by Kevin Harvick. * 2015: In the 2015 running, Jimmie Johnson grabbed his fourth straight win in the fall race, and became the third driver in the track's history to sweep both races at Texas, as well as winning his third consecutive event at the track. Brad Keselowski led 312 of 334 laps (a track record). Dale Earnhardt, Jr. tagged the wall with his right-rear corner. This affected the handling of his car and he began to fall back through the field. He spun in the turn 3 apron on lap 167, Kevin Harvick made an unscheduled stop with 53 laps to go for a flat right-rear tire. He fell to 20th‚Äìplace in the running order and down a lap. Carl Edwards kicked off the final cycle of pit stops with 38 laps to go. Keselowski hit pit road with 37 laps to go and the lead cycled to Harvick.

ATV was owned by Christian Moustgaard. His son Eetu Moustgaard worked at ATV as a reporter. The channel was known in Helsinki for its (then) revolutionary approach to urban journalism and TV entertainment in general. The production team had no previous experience in TV work and the channel basically \\"made it up as they went along\\". In a way the programs looked much like the reality-TV shows that the modern day television is packed with. But as the term Reality-TV did not yet exist, ATV was heavily criticised for its amateurish look and at times challenging views as being unprofessional and childish. Mostly it seems, though, that the channel's utter lack of resemblance with conventional television and its immediacy in regard to the surrounding urban landscape was welcomed by the majority of viewers. In an attempt to attract attention and to accumulate much-sought revenues from related SMS-services, ATV soon after its launch took to showing pornography without charge during nighttime.

It is a standalone sequel to his 1984 film Purple Rain. Like its predecessor, it was accompanied by a soundtrack album of the same name.The Washington Post ==Plot== The plot continues with The Kid, living future life as an upbeat performer and co-owner of a club, Glam Slam, which was willed to him from Billy, who was the owner of First Avenue Club in the first film. Solitary and lovelorn, he spends his personal time composing songs, and writing letters to his deceased father. The other co-owner who was included in the will is Morris (Morris Day), his rival who now also owns his own club, Pandemonium, while desiring control of the other two clubs in the Seven Corners area, which are Melody Cool and the Clinton Club. Needing to pay the mayor of Seven Corners $10,000, Morris attempts to extort The Kid ‚Äì by threatening to take full ownership of Glam Slam. Making matters more interesting is the arrival of Aura, an angel sent from Heaven to sway both Morris and The Kid into leading more righteous lives ‚Äì while dealing with their attraction to her. As The Kid continues to show resistance, Morris begins to embarrass him by way of performances with his band, to steal The Kid's customers. Losing clientele and having his club defamed by Morris's henchmen, The Kid decides to challenge Morris to a music battle for ownership of Glam Slam. ==Cast== * Prince as The Kid, owner of the Glam Slam Club * Morris Day as Morris, co-owner of Glam Slam, and the Pandemonium Club * Jerome Benton as Jerome, Morris's assistant * The Time as themselves * Jill Jones as Jill, Kid's girlfriend * Mavis Staples as Melody Cool, the owner of Melody Cool Club * George Clinton as George, owner of the Clinton Club * Ingrid Chavez as Aura, an angel * Tevin Campbell as Tevin, the son of Melody Cool * Robin Power as Robin, co-owner of Glam Slam and the Pandemonium Club, who is the daughter of Billy, the owner of First Avenue Club in the first film * Rosie Gaines as a member of The Kid's band, NPG * Elisa Fiorillo as Aura's singing voice (uncredited) ==Production== According to Terry Lewis, the film was originally a vehicle for The Time, but \\"in the end the story got lost and it became a Prince picture. But that was cool. I think our rapport with Prince is better now than it's ever been, because there's a mutual respect in the air ... Plus we got to hang out for six months on somebody else's budget.\\" Morris Day explained: \\"A sequel to Purple Rain is what it ended up being. And the role that The Time plays is, well, crooks. In Purple Rain we were small time crooks and now we've graduated to the big time. We own and control this area called Seven Corners ‚Äì which is really four corners and four clubs ‚Äì and everyone answers to us. It's really about the rivalry between us and The Kid (Prince), who is the picked-on, felt-sorry-for hero. But in the end he gets the girl and he beats us with a ballad.

A colony of bees may live in a bee tree for many years. Most bee trees have a large inner hollow, often with an upper and lower entrance. Colonies in trees have fixed comb, so inspection and management is impossible, as is most harvesting without destroying the colony. A beekeeper can perform a cut-out on a gum hive. The trunk is cut open to expose the cavity, and the comb is carefully removed and strapped into standard frames. The frames are then put to a conventional hive, such as a Langstroth hive. The bees will follow into the new hive especially if the queen and brood can be transferred. If the tree is cut down and the trunk section containing the colony is removed, the result is a log gum or gum hive. A log gum is essentially a bee tree cut into a short section that contained a colony of honey bees. It got its name from the fact that when gum trees die they rot from the inside out, thereby creating a large cavity in which bees would commonly nest. These hives are fixed comb hives and, therefore, medicating and inspecting is almost impossible. Category:Beekeeping Category:Trees ","title":"Bee tree"},{"id":"2220453","text":"Keith A.

He fought both for and against Artaxerxes III of Persia. He is also known as the first husband of Barsine, who later became mistress to Alexander the Great. In 358 BC, Mentor, along with his brother Memnon, were hired to provide military leadership by a rebel Persian satrap, Artabazus. Despite Mentor's capable leadership, the rebellion failed, and Artabazus, Barsine and Memnon fled to Macedon, where they were welcomed by Philip II. Mentor fled to Egypt. Pharaoh Nectanebo II immediately enlisted the aid of the Greek mercenary, as he expected a Persian invasion was imminent. The pharaoh sent Mentor, at the head of 4000 mercenaries, to support Sidon, which had rebelled from Persia.Diod. 16.42.2 Although Mentor won significant victories against some of the satraps, he was unable to defeat Artaxerxes' army, and was captured in 346 BC. Upon his capture, Artaxerxes evidently recognized Mentor's skills, and pardoned him. Immediately, Mentor was sent to aid in the invasion of his former refuge, Egypt. During the Egyptian campaign Mentor led one of three divisions of the great kings Hellenic army he shared the command with Bagoas a Persian of some note whom Diodorus of Sicily describes as the man 'whom the King trusted most, a man exceptionally daring and impatient of propriety.'Diod. 16.47.4 the pair had some success in Egypt taking Bubastus amongst other cities by one cunning device, garrisoning the cities were both native Egyptians and Greek mercenary troops Mentor offered one side or the other a favourable surrender creating stasis and infighting within the garrisons weakening the defensive troops and making it far more easy for the Persians to gain the city by subterfuge. This tactic proved critical in the battle for Egypt, Nectanebo preserving the loss of so many of his fortified towns and cities withdrew from Memphis towards the south choosing not to contest his kingship in pitched battle. After the defeat of Egypt, \\"Artaxerxes, seeing that Mentor the general had performed great services for him in the war against the Egyptians, advanced him over and above his other friends.\\"Diod. 16.52.1 The king appointed Mentor his commander in the west in 342 BC and satrap of the Asiatic coast; he was also given a vast wealth of silver. One of his actions during his short tenure at this post was to pardon Artabazus, whom he allowed to return home, along with Barsine and Memnon. Mentor died after just four years in his post. His daughter later married Nearchus, and Barsine remarried, to Memnon.

In the late 19th century, she was the world's largest cargo vessel. She was launched on December 1, 1888, by the Leavitt-Storer shipyard of Waldoboro, Maine, United States, and was named for Oliver Ames (then the Governor of Massachusetts). The Governor Ames was owned and operated by the Atlantic Shipping Company based in Somerset, Massachusetts. Although the Governor Ames was the first five-masted schooner, she was preceded by the five-masted Great Lakes barkentine David Dows, which was confusingly called a schooner despite having a square-rigged foremast. The David Dows was longer than the Governor Ames but otherwise smaller. The schooner's first voyage, in ballast to Baltimore, Maryland, resulted in disaster on December 11, 1888, when the foremast snapped in high winds, taking the other masts with it and dismasting the Governor Ames completely. The anchor chain also broke, and the schooner ran aground on Georges Bank. Refloated and towed to port, the vessel was remasted with shorter masts, following which it sailed from Maine to Buenos Aires in Argentina with a cargo of of spruce and pine lumber valued at $29,868, believed to be the largest or second largest cargo ever taken by an American vessel at the time. The lumber trade proving profitable, she was employed for the next five years in that trade, venturing far away from the Eastern seaboard and its coal trade for which she was built. She rounded Cape Horn to bring lumber to Redondo Beach, California, and was then employed hauling lumber from Pacific ports to Australia. Returning to the waters of the Eastern United States via Cape Horn once more, she entered the coal trade finally in Fall 1894. On May 30, 1899, the Governor Ames grounded in eighteen feet of water near Key West, Florida. With assistance from the tug Childs and other schooners and the jettisoning of of coal, the Governor Ames was refloated the next afternoon without major damage. The Governor Ames was wrecked in a gale on December 13, 1909, four miles off Cape Hatteras on the North Carolina coast, having sailed on December 9 from Brunswick, Georgia, bound for New York with a cargo of railroad ties piled high on her deck. The schooner was driven onto Wimble Shoals and broke up within two hours. Thirteen of the fourteen aboard perished, including the master, Captain King, and his wife. The sole survivor was one Joseph Speering of New York. ==References== Category:Ships built in Maine Category:Schooners of the United States Category:Lumber schooners Category:Five-masted ships Category:Merchant ships of the United States Category:Individual sailing vessels Category:Shipwrecks of the Carolina coast Category:1888 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1909 Category:Waldoboro, Maine ","title":"Governor Ames"},{"id":"2220469","text":"Harvey William Mason (born February 22, 1947) is an American jazz drummer, record producer, and member of the band Fourplay.

The term is also used for the stiffened supporter or supportasse used to hold such a collar in place. The term may originate from a conjectured Spanish word picadillo, from picado meaning punctured or pierced or the Welsh word pica meaning pointed. This is similar to the Spanish word picadura, used for the lace collars of the seventeenth century that contained much elaborate cut work point lace. Examples of a piccadill can be seen on portraits of Queen Elizabeth I and other portraits of her contemporaries such as Sir Walter Raleigh. Piccadilly, a street in central London, is believed to be named after the piccadill, perhaps because a landowner in the area once made his fortune from them.\\"piccadill\\", Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition 1989 ==See also== *Ruff (clothing) a similar, contemporary fashion. ==References== Category:History of clothing (Western fashion) ","title":"Piccadill"},{"id":"2220475","text":"Momƒçilo Tapavica (; ; 14 October 1872 - 10 January 1949) was an all-around sportsperson, competing in tennis, weightlifting, wrestling. Tapavica achieved his best result in tennis by winning the singles bronze medal at the 1896 Summer Olympics, making him the first ethnic Serb, Slav and Hungarian citizen to win an Olympic medal. After his sporting career Tapavica became a well- known architect. ==Sports career== Tapavica, an ethnic Serb, was born in N√°dalja, Kingdom of Hungary (now Nadalj, Serbia) in 1872. He began to practise sports in √öjvid√©k (Novi Sad), continuing his training in Budapest, where he studied architecture and civil engineering at the Technical College. His performances excelled and he was selected in the Hungarian team for the first Olympic Games in Athens in 1896, where he competed in tennis, weightlifting and wrestling. At the 1896 Summer Olympics, Tapavica, being the lone tennis player in Hungary's Olympic Team, won the bronze medal in the singles tennis tournament. In the first round, he defeated D. Frangopoulos of Greece. The second round gave him a bye, subsequently Dionysios Kasdaglis of Egypt beat Tapavica in the semifinal, and with no playoff for third place he shared bronze medal honors with Greek Konstantinos Paspatis. Tapavica was the first ethnic Serb to win an Olympic medal, as well as the first ‚Äì and to date the only ‚Äì Hungarian to win a medal in tennis at the Olympic Games. He did not compete in the doubles tournament. In weightlifting, Tapavica overextended himself, which caused him a shoulder injury and eventually finished last of the six competitors in the two-handed weightlifting, now known as the clean and jerk. Two days later, still unhealed, Tapavica was defeated in the first round of the wrestling competition by Stephanos Christopoulos. The two were nearly evenly matched, but Tapavica tired first and conceded. After the Olympic Games, Tapavica never again participated in competitive events, however he continued to do recreational sports, such as athletics, gymnastics and rowing. For many years he was a member of the √öjvid√©k-based rowing club Danubius. ==Architecture achievements== Matica srpska building in Novi Sad After his graduation, Tapavica remained in Budapest for a shorter period before returning to √öjvid√©k. In 1908, for the invitation of Nicholas I of Montenegro, Tapavica went to Montenegro, where he designed several buildings. Among his notable works from this period are the German Embassy and National Bank in Cetinje, and the building of Boka Hotel in Herceg Novi, which was destroyed by an earthquake in 1979. The building of the Matica srpska in Novi Sad, erected by the plans of Tapavica, was finished in 1912. Upon the outbreak of World War I, Tapavica first emigrated to Austria-Hungary, and later through Rome and Lausanne he ended up in Morocco. While in Morocco, he joined the French Foreign Legion and became friends with Spain's future dictator Francisco Franco. After the war he returned to Novi Sad, where he ran his own architectural design company and actively participated in discussions about the urban planning of the city. Following World War II, in 1948, he moved to Poreƒç, where he significantly contributed to the rebuilding of the war-torn city. He died in 1949 in Pula. ==Legacy== Monument dedicated to Momƒçilo Tapavica in Novi Sad His life is the subject of a 2016 documentary Tapavica directed by Milan Todoroviƒá.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5634852/ A bust is bestowed in his honor in Novi Sad. ==See also== * List of Serbian architects ==References * Tapavica - documentary movie Category:1872 births Category:1949 deaths Category:People from Srbobran Category:Serbs of Vojvodina Category:Tennis players at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:19th- century male tennis players Category:Weightlifters at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:19th-century sportsmen Category:Wrestlers at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:Hungarian male sport wrestlers Category:Hungarian male tennis players Category:Serbian male tennis players Category:Hungarian male weightlifters Category:Serbian male weightlifters Category:Serbian male sport wrestlers Category:Olympic tennis players of Hungary Category:Olympic weightlifters of Hungary Category:Olympic wrestlers of Hungary Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Hungary Category:Olympic medalists in tennis Category:People associated with physical culture Category:Hungarian architects Category:Serbian architects Category:Medalists at the 1896 Summer Olympics Category:Soldiers of the French Foreign Legion ","title":"Momƒçilo Tapavica"},{"id":"2220485","text":"right EcoDuro, Inc. is a manufacturing, engineering and marketing company in Ann Arbor, Michigan that holds patents in the major industrial companies for its unique engineered paper pallets.

Their album L'envoy√© sp√©cial will be published (out of sequence) as volume 65, with volume 64 by Cavin and Lampil being published in 2021.https://www.planetebd.com/actualite/les-tuniques-bleues- tome-65-avant-le-64/477.html Six of the first ten volumes were illustrated by Louis Salverius, with Lambil taking over after Salverius' death. The stories appear first in Spirou, before being published as an album. The French editions are published by Dupuis. New albums are among the top ten best selling comics in French each year, with 184,800 copies for the 50th album alone in 2006. Les Tuniques Bleues spawned a 1989 computer game called North and South. ==Plot== A scene showing the two main characters. The original setting was the frontier of the Old West, where the main characters were American cavalrymen. Those stories, rarely longer than a single page, were comedic adventures about popular Western stereotypes and the absurdity of military life. One recurring feature was the blunder that lead to the Cavalry fort being besieged by outraged Native Americans, or in one case, the cavalry having to besiege their own fort after the Indians have tricked them into leaving it and taken over. As the series progressed, the stories became longer and more involved, retaining their humorous highlights. The drawing style also changed, after the death of the original artist Salverius, from overtly cartoonish to semi-realistic. In the second album, Du Nord au Sud, the main characters, Blutch and Chesterfield, travel east to join Ulysses S. Grant's army and fight in the Civil War. The 18th album, Blue Retro, describes how the characters were first drafted into the military when the war had already begun and makes no mention of the time they spent on the frontier, contradicting the events in album 2 and others. This retconned origin and continuity hiccups are not detrimental to the enjoyment and understanding of the series since each album is a stand-alone adventure or collection of short stories. Adventures at the frontier fort still occasionally take place. The two main protagonists are colorful and clashing opposites. Corporal Blutch is a reluctant soldier, highly critical of authority, whose only wish is to get out of the army and return to civilian life, often threatening to desert and coming up with ways to avoid going into yet another senseless battle. Blutch does have a heroic side and will not hesitate to fight against the Confederate troops even to the risk of his own life. Sergeant Cornelius Chesterfield is by contrast a devoted and obedient career soldier, always determined that he and Blutch should be in the thick of the action. He is proud of his scars and dreams of military glory. Though strong and brave to the point of recklessness, he is clumsy and narrow-minded, unable to clearly perceive the madness of the war around him. Though their relationship is often antagonistic, they are comrades for life and have saved each other's lives many times in spite of repeated threats made by both of doing the other in. Other recurring characters include the somewhat insane, charge-obsessed Captain Stark and the bumbling general staff, headed by the anger-prone General Alexander. Historic figures are also occasionally present in the narrative: alongside General Grant, they include President Abraham Lincoln, Confederate commander Robert E. Lee, and war photographer Mathew Brady. As happens in fiction, especially in bandes dessin√©es, Blutch and Chesterfield often get sent on special missions which take them all over the map, from Mexico to Canada, and mix them up in projects from railroad construction to spying on the Confederacy's secret submarine project (based on the actual CSS David). Many albums are built around historical events or characters such as Chinese immigrant labor, the treatment of African American soldiers, Charleston's submarines, and General Lee's horse Traveller. Chesterfield even goes undercover to confront guerrilla leader William Quantrill and his henchmen Jesse and Frank James. On another occasion they had to contend with a racist officer, Captain Nepel, based on the French politician Jean-Marie Le Pen. Historical details are generally quite exact, and accuracy has steadily improved over the years. Yet the series is first and foremost entertainment and historic details are altered to suit the story. The serious drama of the plots is balanced by frequent humorous incidents and Blutch's constant sarcastic wisecracks. Although this is not strictly speaking an adult-oriented bande dessin√©e, the authors are not afraid of showing the reality of war in a harsh, but tactful manner, such as dead bodies in the aftermath of a battle. Military authority, especially the uncaring and/or incompetent leader is often the subject of parody and derision. ==Albums== # Un chariot dans l'Ouest # Du Nord au Sud # Et pour 1500 dollars en plus # Outlaw # Les d√©serteurs # La prison de Robertsonville # Les Bleus de la marine # Les cavaliers du ciel # La grande patrouille # Des Bleus et des tuniques # Des Bleus en Noir et Blanc # Les Bleus tournent cosaques # Les Bleus dans la gadoue # Le blanc-bec # Rumberley # Bronco Benny # El Padre # Blue r√©tro # Le David # Black Face # Les cinq salopards # Des Bleus et des dentelles # Les cousins d'en face # Baby blue # Des Bleus et des bosses # L'or du Quebec # Bull Run # Les Bleus de la balle # En avant l'amn√©sique! # La Rose de Bantry # Drummer boy # Les Bleus en folie # Grumbler et fils # Vertes ann√©es # Captain Nepel # Quantrill # Duel dans la manche # Les planqu√©s # Puppet Blues # Les hommes de paille # Les Bleus en cavale # Qui veut la peau du G√©n√©ral? # Des Bleus et du Blues # L'oreille de Lincoln # Emeutes √† New York # Requiem pour un Bleu # Les nancy hart # Arabesque # Marriage √† fort Bow # La traque # Stark sous toutes les coutures # Des bleus dans le brouillard # Sang bleu chez les Bleus # Miss Walker # Indien, mon fr√®re # Dent pour dent # Colorado Story # Les bleues se mettes au vert # Les quatre √©vang√©listes # Carte blanche pour un Bleu # L'√©trange soldat Franklin # Sallie # La bataille du Crat√®re # Yet to be announced # L'envoy√© sp√©cial == Historical correlations == Several albums highlight historical facts of the American Civil War, other adventures are set in a place or anonymous battle. Some accounts tell of an encounter with a Native American tribe without any relation to the American Civil War. However, the chronology of the albums does not follow that of the war, but several albums are in flashback, tracing the past of the two protagonists, possibly narrated by one of them (Bull Run) or another character (Vertes Ann√©es). { class=\\" centre\\" style=\\"text-align:left;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" Album !Historical reference - 1.

Known especially as a hard-driving, sharp-tongued manager from 1967 to 1969 and from 1971 to 1988, he led teams to three American League pennants, one National League pennant, and two World Series triumphs. He is one of eight managers to win pennants in both major leagues, and joined Bill McKechnie in becoming only the second manager to lead three franchises to the Series. He and Lou Piniella are the only managers in history to lead four teams to seasons of 90 or more wins. Williams was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2008 following his election by the Veterans Committee. ==BiographyPlaying career=== Williams was born on May 7, 1929, in St. Louis, Missouri, and lived there until age 13, when his family moved to Pasadena, California. After attending Pasadena City College, he signed his first professional contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, and played his first major league game with Brooklyn in 1951. A right-handed batter and thrower, Williams was listed as tall and . Initially an outfielder, he separated a shoulder attempting to make a diving catch on August 25, 1952;Retrosheet box score: 1952-08-25 he missed the rest of the season and permanently weakened his throwing arm. As a result, he learned to play several positions (he was frequently a first baseman and third baseman) and became a notorious \\"bench jockey\\" in order to keep his major league job.Alfano, Peter (15 August 1983), \\"Bench Jockeying: A Lost Art in Baseball.\\" The New York Times He appeared in 1,023 games over 13 seasons with the Dodgers, Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Indians, Kansas City Athletics and Boston Red Sox. Williams posted a career batting average of .260; his 768 hits included 70 home runs, 157 doubles and 12 triples. In the field, he appeared in 456 games in the outfield, 257 at third base, and 188 at first. He was a favorite of Paul Richards, who acquired Williams four different times between 1956 and 1962 when Richards was a manager or general manager with Baltimore and the Houston Colt .45s. Williams never played for Houston; he was acquired in an off-season \\"paper transaction\\" on October 12, 1962, then traded to the Red Sox for another outfielder, Carroll Hardy, on December 10. His two-year playing career in Boston was uneventful, except for one occasion. On June 27, 1963, Williams was victimized by one of the greatest catches in Fenway Park history. His long drive to the opposite field was snagged by Cleveland right fielder Al Luplow, who made a leaping catch at the wall and tumbled into the bullpen with the ball in his grasp.Sports Illustrated, October 14, 1985 ===Managerial career=== An \\"Impossible Dream\\" in Boston On October 14, 1964, after a season during which Williams hit a career-low .159, the Red Sox handed him his unconditional release. At 35, Williams was at a career crossroads: Richards gave him a spring training invitation but no guarantee that he would make the 1965 Astros' playing roster; the Red Sox offered Williams a job as playing coach with their Triple-A farm team, the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League. Looking to begin a post-playing career in baseball, Williams accepted the Seattle assignment. Within days, a shuffle in 1965 affiliations forced Boston to move its top minor league team to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League. This caused the Red Sox' Triple-A manager, Seattle native Edo Vanni, to resign in order to remain in the Pacific Northwest. With a sudden opening for the Toronto job, Williams was promoted to manager of the 1965 Leafs. As a novice pilot, Williams adopted a hard-nosed, disciplinarian style and won two consecutive Governors' Cup championships with teams laden with young Red Sox prospects. He then signed a one-year contract to manage the 1967 Red Sox. Boston had suffered through eight straight seasons of losing baseball, and attendance had fallen to such an extent that owner Tom Yawkey was threatening to move the team. The Red Sox had talented young players, but the team was known as a lazy \\"country club.\\" As Carl Yastrzemski commented, \\"if you don't keep your nose to the grindstone you won't (win)...we kept our noses so far away from the grindstone we couldn't even see it.\\"Sport magazine, November 1967 Williams decided to risk everything and impose discipline on his players. He vowed that \\"we will win more ballgames than we lose\\" ‚Äî a bold statement for a club that had finished only a half-game from last place in 1966. The only team with a worse record than the Red Sox was their arch-rival, the New York Yankees, who were headed in a downward spiral only two years after losing the 1964 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. In spring training, Williams drilled players in fundamentals for hours. He issued fines for curfew violations, and insisted his players put the success of the team before their own. In Yastrzemski's words, \\"Dick Williams didn't take anything when he took over the club last spring...to the best of my knowledge‚Äîand I would know if it had happened‚Äîno one challenged Williams all season.\\"://Sport magazine, November 1967 The Red Sox began 1967 playing better baseball and employing the aggressive style of play that Williams had learned with the Dodgers. Williams benched players for lack of effort and poor performance, and battled tooth and nail with umpires. Through the All-Star break, Boston fulfilled Williams' promise and played better than .500 ball, hanging close to the American League's four contending teams ‚Äî the Detroit Tigers, Minnesota Twins, Chicago White Sox and California Angels. Outfielder Carl Yastrzemski, in his seventh season with the Red Sox, transformed his hitting style to become a pull-hitter, eventually winning the 1967 AL Triple Crown, leading the league in batting average, home runs (tying Harmon Killebrew of the Twins), and RBI. Williams (fourth from left) and other Red Sox personnel with Mayor of Boston John F. Collins (at right) in October 1967 In late July, the Red Sox rattled off a 10-game winning streak on the road and came home to a riotous welcome from 10,000 fans at Boston's Logan Airport. The Red Sox inserted themselves into a five-team pennant race, and stayed in the hunt despite the loss of star outfielder Tony Conigliaro to a beanball on August 18. On the closing weekend of the season, led by Yastrzemski and 22-game-winning pitcher Jim Lonborg, Boston defeated the Twins in two head-to- head games, while Detroit split its series with the Angels. The \\"Impossible Dream\\" Red Sox had won their first AL pennant since 1946, then they extended the highly talented and heavily favored St. Louis Cardinals to seven games in the 1967 World Series, losing to the great Bob Gibson three times. Despite the Series loss, the Red Sox were the toasts of New England; Williams was named Major League Manager of the Year by The Sporting News and signed to a new three-year contract. But he would not serve it out. In 1968, the team fell to fourth place when Conigliaro could not return from his head injury, and Williams' two top pitchers ‚Äî Lonborg and Jos√© Santiago ‚Äî suffered sore arms. He began to clash with Yastrzemski, and with owner Yawkey. With his club a distant third in the AL East, Williams was fired on September 23, 1969 and replaced by Eddie Popowski for the last nine games of the season.Eldridge, Larry. \\"Williams Fired By Red Sox,\\" The Associated Press (AP), Wednesday September 24, 1969. Retrieved August 18, 2019 Two titles in a row in Oakland After spending 1970 as the third base coach of the Montreal Expos, working under Gene Mauch, Williams returned to the managerial ranks the next year as boss of the Oakland Athletics, owned by Charlie Finley. The iconoclastic Finley had signed some of the finest talent in baseball ‚Äì including Catfish Hunter, Reggie Jackson, Sal Bando, Bert Campaneris, Rollie Fingers and Joe Rudi ‚Äì but his players hated him for his penny-pinching and constant meddling in the team's affairs. During his first decade as the Athletics' owner, 1961‚Äì1970, Finley had changed managers a total of ten times. Inheriting a second-place team from predecessor John McNamara, Williams promptly directed the A's to 101 victories and their first AL West title in 1971 behind another brilliant young player, pitcher Vida Blue. Despite being humbled in the ALCS by the defending World Champion Orioles, Finley brought Williams back for 1972, when the \\"Oakland Dynasty\\" began. Off the field, the A's players brawled with each other and defied baseball's tonsorial code. Because long hair, mustaches and beards were now the rage in the \\"civilian\\" world, Finley decided on a mid-season promotion encouraging his men to wear their hair long and grow facial hair. Fingers adopted his trademark handlebar mustache (which he still has to this day); Williams himself grew a mustache. Of course, talent, not hairstyle, truly defined the Oakland Dynasty of the early 1970s. The 1972 A's won their division by 5¬Ω games over the White Sox and led the league in home runs, shutouts and saves. They defeated the Tigers in a bitterly fought ALCS, and found themselves facing the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. With the A's leading power hitter, Jackson, out with an injury, Cincinnati's Big Red Machine was favored to win, but the home run heroics of Oakland catcher Gene Tenace and the managerial maneuvering of Williams resulted in a seven-game World Series victory for the A's, their first championship since 1930, when they played in Philadelphia. In 1973, with Williams back for an unprecedented (for the Finley era) third straight campaign, the A's again coasted to a division title, then defeated Baltimore in the ALCS and the NL champion New York Mets in the World Series ‚Äì each hard- fought series going the limit. With their World Series win, Oakland became baseball's first repeat champion since the 1961‚Äì62 New York Yankees. But Williams had a surprise for Finley. Tired of his owner's meddling, and upset by Finley's public humiliation of second baseman Mike Andrews for his fielding miscues during the World Series, Williams resigned. George Steinbrenner, then finishing his first season as owner of the Yankees, immediately signed Williams as his manager. However, Finley protested that Williams owed Oakland the final year of his contract and could not manage anywhere else, and so Steinbrenner hired Bill Virdon instead. Williams was the first manager in A's franchise history to leave the team with a winning record after running it for two full seasons. From Southern California to Montreal and back =California Angels= Seemingly at the peak of his career, Williams began the 1974 season out of work. But when the Angels struggled under manager Bobby Winkles, team owner Gene Autry received Finley's permission to negotiate with Williams, and in mid-season Williams was back in a big-league dugout. The change in management, though, did not alter the fortunes of the Angels, as they finished in last place, 22 games behind the A's, who would win their third straight World Championship under Williams' replacement, Alvin Dark. Overall, Williams' Anaheim tenure turned out to be a miserable one. He did not have nearly as much talent as he'd had to work with in Boston and Oakland, and the Angels did not respond to Williams' somewhat authoritarian managing style. They finished last in the AL West again in 1975. During the 1975 season, Boston Red Sox pitcher Bill Lee stated that the Angels' hitters were \\"so weak, they could hold batting practice in the Boston Sheraton hotel lobby and not hit the chandelier\\". Williams responded by having his team actually do so before the game with the Red Sox until hotel security put a stop to it.https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/former-manager-williams-fed-up-with- todays-game/. The Angels were 18 games below .500 (and in the midst of a player revolt) in 1976 when Williams was fired July 22. =Montreal Expos= In 1977, he returned to Montreal as manager of the Expos, who had just come off 107 losses and a last-place finish in the NL East. Team president John McHale had been impressed with Williams' efforts in Boston and Oakland, and thought he was what the Expos needed to finally become a winner. After cajoling the Expos into improved, but below .500, performances in his first two seasons, Williams turned the 1979‚Äì80 Expos into pennant contenders. The team won over 90 games both years‚Äîthe first winning seasons in franchise history. The 1979 unit won 95 games, the most that the franchise would win in Montreal. However, they finished second each time to the eventual World Champion (the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1979 and the Philadelphia Phillies in 1980). Williams was never afraid to give young players a chance to play, and his Expos teams were flush with young talent, including All-Stars such as outfielder Andre Dawson and catcher Gary Carter. With a solid core of young players and a fruitful farm system, the Expos seemed a lock to contend for a long time to come. But Williams' hard edge alienated his players‚Äîespecially his pitchers‚Äîand ultimately wore out his welcome. He labeled pitcher Steve Rogers a fraud with \\"king of the mountain syndrome\\" ‚Äì meaning that Rogers had been a good pitcher on a bad team for so long that he was unable to \\"step up\\" when the team became good. Williams also lost confidence in closer Jeff Reardon, whom the Montreal front office had acquired in a much publicized trade with the Mets. When the 1981 Expos performed below expectations, Williams was fired during the pennant drive on September 7. With the arrival of his easy-going successor Jim Fanning, who restored Reardon to the closer's role, the inspired Expos made the playoffs for the only time in their 36-year history in Montreal. However, they fell in heartbreaking fashion to Rick Monday and the eventual World Champion Los Angeles Dodgers in a five-game NLCS. =San Diego Padres= Williams was not unemployed for long, however. In 1982, he took over the San Diego Padres. By 1984, he had guided the Padres to their first NL West Division championship. In the NLCS, the NL East champion Chicago Cubs ‚Äì making their first postseason appearance since 1945 ‚Äì won Games 1 and 2, but Williams' Padres took the next three games in a miraculous comeback to win the pennant. In the World Series, however, San Diego was no match for Sparky Anderson's Detroit Tigers, a team that had won 104 games during the regular season. Although the Tigers won the Series in five games, both Williams and Anderson joined Dark, Joe McCarthy, and Yogi Berra as managers who had won pennants in both major leagues (Tony La Russa joined this group in 2004, Jim Leyland followed suit in 2006, and Joe Maddon in 2016). The Padres fell to third in 1985, and Williams was let go as manager just before 1986 spring training. His record with the Padres was 337‚Äì311 over four seasons. As of 2011, he was the only manager in the team's history without a losing season. His difficulties with the Padres stemmed from a power struggle with team president Ballard Smith and general manager Jack McKeon. Williams was a hire of team owner (and McDonald's restaurant magnate) Ray Kroc, whose health was failing. McKeon and Smith (who also happened to be Kroc's son-in-law) were posturing to buy the team and viewed Williams as a threat to their plans. With his San Diego tenure at an end, it appeared that Williams' managerial career was finished. Final seasons in uniform When another perennial loser, the Seattle Mariners, lost 19 of their first 28 games in 1986 under Chuck Cottier, Williams came back to the American League West on May 6 for the first time in almost a decade. The Mariners showed some life that season and almost reached .500 the following season. However, Williams' autocratic managing style no longer resonated with the new generation of ballplayers. Williams was fired on June 8, 1988 with Seattle 23‚Äì33 and in sixth place. It would be his last major-league managing job. Williams' career won-loss totals were 1,571 wins and 1,451 losses over 21 seasons. In 1989, Williams was named manager of the West Palm Beach Tropics of the Senior Professional Baseball Association, a league featuring mostly former major league players 35 years of age and older. The Tropics went 52‚Äì20 in the regular season and ran away with the Southern Division title. Despite their regular season dominance, the Tropics lost 12‚Äì4 to the St. Petersburg Pelicans in the league's championship game. The Tropics folded at the end of the season, and the rest of the league folded a year later. He remained in the game, however, as a special consultant to George Steinbrenner and the New York Yankees. In 1990, Williams published his autobiography, No More Mister Nice Guy. His acrimonious departure in 1969 distanced Williams from the Red Sox for the remainder of the Yawkey ownership period (through 2001), but after the change in ownership and management that followed, he was selected to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2006. Williams' number was retired by the Fort Worth Cats. The Cats were a popular minor league team in Fort Worth and Williams played there during 1948, 1949 and 1950, while he was working his way through the Dodgers' system. Moreover, Williams‚Äîin his Hall off Fame speech‚Äîcited Bobby Bragan, his Fort Worth manager, as a significant influence on his own career. After the Texas League Cats finally disbanded in 1964, they returned as an independent league team in 2001. These \\"New\\" Cats retired Williams' number. ===Hall of Fame induction=== Williams was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in December 2007, and was inducted on July 27, 2008.Delighted Tanner calls protege Gossage \`My Marilyn Monroe' ‚Äì MLB ‚Äì Yahoo!

Before Williams became a major league manager in 1967, he successfully appeared on the television quiz shows Match Game and the original Hollywood Squares. According to Peter Marshall's Backstage with the Original Hollywood Squares, Williams won $50,000 as a contestant on the latter show. His son, Rick Williams, a former minor league pitcher and major league pitching coach, became a professional scout for the Atlanta Braves. Williams died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm at a hospital near his home in Henderson, Nevada, on July 7, 2011. ===Arrest=== In January 2000, Williams pleaded no contest to indecent exposure charges in Florida. The complaint against him alleged that he was \\"walking naked and masturbating\\" on the balcony outside his hotel room. Williams subsequently stated that he was not aware of the details of the complaint when he pleaded no contest, and that although he was standing naked at the balcony door, he was not on the balcony and was not masturbating. This occurred just weeks before Baseball Hall of Fame balloting by the Veterans Committee. Williams' arrest appeared to impact consideration by the committee, and he would not be inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame until 2008. \\"What happened to me down in Fort Myers when I was arrested evidently hurt me quite a bit\\", Williams told The New York Times. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball managers by wins ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Cooper, Steve, Red Sox Diehard, 1967 season retrospective.

It is the home of Dartmouth Big Green football and outdoor track teams. The athletic teams at Dartmouth College compete in the Ivy League. In 1893, Dartmouth alumni built a football field called Alumni Oval in the southeastern part of the campus. The field's original wooden grandstand, which backed up on Crosby Street, burned in 1911. In 1923, the College built Memorial Field, with a brick-faced concrete stand and press box on Crosby Street. The stadium opened as a memorial to the students and alumni who had served and died in World War I. Permanent stands on the east side of the field were built later, and end zone bleachers have also been used. Memorial Field underwent renovation during the summer of 2006, including replacement of the natural grass field with artificial turf to allow nearly year-round use; installation of an 8-lane Tartan track; construction of safety improvements; and the construction of a new varsity athletics center that has reduced the East Stands. With some of the loss made up by stands placed behind the end zones, the current seating capacity is approximately 11,000, down from 22,000 pre-renovation.

Tkach (; March 16, 1927 ‚Äì September 23, 1995) was the appointed successor of Herbert W. Armstrong, founder of the Worldwide Church of God. Tkach became President and Pastor General of the church upon the death of Armstrong in 1986. Tkach spearheaded a major doctrinal transformation of the Worldwide Church of God, abandoning Armstrong's unconventional doctrines and bringing the church into accord with orthodox evangelical Christianity. His son, Joseph Tkach Jr., continued his work and in 1997 the Worldwide Church of God became a member of the National Association of Evangelicals. During Tkach's tenure, the changes that he implemented stirred much controversy and significant dissent among those who continued to follow Armstrong's theology. The dissenters labeled the changes as heresy and many left to form new church organizations. Within the mainstream Christian community, some have hailed Tkach's reforms, which brought a church from the fringe to orthodoxy, as unprecedented.Ruth Tucker, \\"From the Fringe to the Fold\\", Christianity Today, July 15, 1996, pp. 26‚Äì32. ==Background== He was born March 16, 1927, in Chicago, the youngest of five children and the only son of Vassil and Mary Tkach. The name Tkach is of Carpatho-Rusyn (Ukrainian) origin, but his parents were originally from Czechoslovakia.Telephone interview with Anna Bregin, sister of Joseph W. Tkach, as quoted in John Trechak, \\"Joseph W. Tkach - God's New Rep on Planet Earth (Part 1)\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 41, March 1989. See also John Trechak, \\"Joseph W. Tkach... (Part IV)\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 44, June 1990. The neighborhood where he grew up was composed mainly of blue-collar working people of Russian origin.John Trechak, \\"Joseph W. Tkach - God's New Rep on Planet Earth (Part 1)\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 41, March 1989. He graduated from Tilden High School in southwest Chicago. He then served a short term in the U.S. Navy near the end of World War II and afterward returned to his native Chicago.Joseph Tkach Jr., Transformed by Truth, Chapter 6, Multnomah, 1997. On March 31, 1951, Tkach married Elaine Apostolos; they had three children: Joseph Jr., Tanya, and Jennifer.Jeff Zhorne and Michael Snyder, \\"Passing the Baton\\", The Worldwide News, January 27, 1986, as quoted in John Trechak, \\"Joseph W. Tkach - God's New Rep on Planet Earth (Part 1)\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 41, March 1989. Tkach grew up in the Russian Orthodox faith, but eventually his family, including his parents, became interested in the Radio Church of God through the radio broadcast of Herbert W. Armstrong, the founder of the church. The Radio Church of God would eventually change its name in 1968 to the Worldwide Church of God (WCG), the church that Tkach would lead. It was a church characterized by the strong influence of its founder and his unique doctrines based on his own interpretation of the Bible. Initially, Tkach was the only member of his family who was not interested in listening to the radio broadcasts. However, a purportedly miraculous event was to change him. At the time, Tkach suffered from severe ulcers and was required to stay on a special diet. His wife then suggested that God would heal him if he were to become a minister in Armstrong's church. Although skeptical, he accepted the suggestion of becoming a minister and he found himself cured, never again to suffer from the ulcers. He was baptized by Radio Church of God minister, Dean Blackwell, on March 1, 1957. On June 7, 1961, Blackwell ordained him a deacon in the Chicago congregation, and on June 3, 1963, Roderick C. Meredith, who would eventually lead a breakaway church from the WCG, ordained him as an elder. In 1966 Tkach moved his family to Pasadena, California, where he enrolled in classes at Ambassador College, a state-approved, but not regionally accredited, college that was sponsored by the WCG. In 1974, he was ordained to the rank of preaching elder.John Trechak, \\"Joseph W. Tkach - God's New Rep on Planet Earth (Part II)\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 42, September 1989. Armstrong taught that the Bible endorsed \\"ranks\\" in the ministry, and elders could progress up the ladder from local elder to preaching elder to pastor to evangelist. The highest rank, apostle, was reserved for the leader of the church.John Robinson, \\"How WCG's Top-Down Rule Evolved\\" In Transition, December 16, 1996, 7, as quoted in Joseph Tkach Jr., Transformed by Truth, Chapter 7, Multnomah, 1997. In the late 1970s a period of financial and leadership disputes occurred within the church hierarchy, with church treasurer, Stanley Rader, at the center of many of the disputes. The gravest incident was the church being placed in financial receivership by the Attorney General of California, George Deukmejian, an action that was later disallowed in court. Tkach took an active role in the defense of Armstrong, Rader, and the church headquarters' operations. He rallied the WCG membership to take action against the court proceedings. Armstrong recognized his effectiveness and subsequently ordained him to the rank of evangelist on September 27, 1979.\\"Evangelists ordained in Tucson\\", The Worldwide News, October 29, 1979, p. 3. See Evangelists of the Worldwide Church of God. In March 1981 Armstrong appointed him to the WCG's advisory council of elders, and eventually, Armstrong named him Director of Church Administration, one of the most prominent administrative positions other than Armstrong himself. ==Selection by Armstrong== Armstrong had recovered from severe heart problems in the late 1970s, but by the mid-1980s he was experiencing rapidly declining health. By 1985 this was common knowledge among church members as the 93-year-old preacher had not been seen in public for several months.John Trechak, \\"Herbert Armstrong's Sinking Ship\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 34, January 1986. According to The Worldwide News, the official church newsletter, Armstrong told his advisory council on January 7, 1986, of his decision to appoint Tkach to succeed him in the event of his death.John Trechak, \\"HWA Names Tkach Successor\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 34, January 1986 and John Trechak, \\"Herbert W. Armstrong Goes to His Reward\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 35, April 1986. It was also announced by Armstrong in a letter to members of the church. Armstrong died on January 16, 1986, only nine days after naming his successor.John Trechak, \\"Herbert W. Armstrong Goes to His Reward\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 35, April 1986. Initially there were few visible changes within the church. Tkach continued Armstrong's tradition of traveling abroad, although his emphasis was more on visiting church members and operations than on Armstrong's agenda of visiting world leaders to attempt to witness to them. The church entered a period of rapid growth during the early years of Tkach's administration. In fact, the membership peaked during his tenure at 126,800 members in 1988.Joseph Tkach Jr., Transformed by Truth, Chapter 5, Multnomah, 1997. The finances were stable, largely due to the church's teaching that members should tithe, giving a tenth of their gross income to the church. The church magazine, The Plain Truth, continued to serialize the final and most controversial book by Armstrong, Mystery of the Ages. Tkach also continued, at least in public, to promote the church's unique doctrines.Joseph W. Tkach, The Worldwide News, August 25, 1986, p. 5. Tkach did not have the charismatic personality of his predecessor. Unlike Armstrong, who kept a strong hold of the reins, Tkach delegated many tasks, including the presentation of the church-supported television broadcast, The World Tomorrow and the authoring of articles and booklets produced by the church. Although Tkach was not known as a theologian, and made no claims as such, eventually he was to have profound impact on the theological foundations of the WCG. ==Doctrinal changes== The first major change under Tkach's tenure was the WCG's doctrine on healing. Previously the church taught that true believers were healed by faith in God and not by doctors. Tkach asked the church leadership to study the question. Once Tkach was satisfied with the results of the study, he officially softened the church's teaching on the matter, encouraging members to seek proper treatment while retaining faith in God as a healer.Joseph W. Tkach, \\"New Understanding of the Meaning of Christ's Broken Body and the Church's Teaching on HEALING\\", The Worldwide News, March 23, 1987 as quoted in John Trechak, \\"Tkach Rewrites HWA's Healing Doctrine\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 38, April 1987 and Joseph Tkach Jr., Transformed by Truth, Chapter 8, Multnomah, 1997. Another officially published doctrinal change was that women in the church would be allowed to wear makeup. In the earliest years of the denomination, Armstrong announced the prohibition of makeup for women. In the 1970s that prohibition was lifted, but in 1981 Armstrong reinstituted the teaching. In 1988 Tkach lifted the ban for good.Joseph W. Tkach, The Worldwide News, November 14, 1988, p. 1 as quoted in John Trechak, \\"WCG News in Brief\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 41, March 1989. See also Joseph Tkach Jr., Transformed by Truth, Chapter 8, Multnomah, 1997. The first major sign of dissent occurred in 1989 when a WCG minister, Gerald Flurry, published a manuscript outlining what he and others believed were disturbing trends in the work, including the beginnings of the doctrinal departure from what had been established by Armstrong. Flurry and another minister, John Amos, were disfellowshipped and went on to form the Philadelphia Church of God (PCG). The PCG began an alternative radio program and magazine, and over the next several years a few thousand WCG members left to join the PCG. Despite this, Tkach continued to implement additional changes in thinking, including: the shift in emphasis away from observing world events primarily through the lens of prophetic interpretation;Joseph W. Tkach, Editorial of The Worldwide News, July 3, 1989 as quoted in John Trechak, \\"WCG Growth Stalls As Doctrines Shift\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 42, September 1989. the removal of the prohibition of interracial marriage;Joseph W. Tkach, Editorial of The Worldwide News, July 30, 1990. the allowance of work on the Sabbath;John Trechak, \\"More Oxen, More Ditches\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 45, September 1990. the acceptance of the trinitarian doctrine;John Trechak, \\"WCG Adopts Trinity Doctrine\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 53, September 1993. and the acceptance of the validity of other Christian denominations,John Trechak, \\"Tkach: There Are True Christians In Other Churches!\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 56, October 1994. among many other changes. Older Armstrong publications that supported the church's once unique doctrines were allowed to go out-of- print.David C. Pack, \\"Doctrinal Changes of the Worldwide Church of God\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 53, September 1993. However, in order to settle legal matters between WCG and splinter group PCG, WCG agreed to sell PCG the copyrights to many of Armstrong's publications, allowing PCG to continue to publish them.Source: Church Sells Armstrong‚Äôs Works As these reforms were being carried out, questions arose as to whether the decisions were truly made by Tkach himself or by others in the church leadership. The church leadership at that time included Mike Feazell, executive assistant and editorial advisor to Tkach, Greg Albrecht, editor of The Plain Truth, and Joseph Tkach, Jr., the son of Joseph W. Tkach, and church administration director. One conspiracy theory stated that the decisions did not come from Tkach himself but from the church leadership. Another stated that the ideas did originate from Tkach but he formed them early in his career, kept them hidden from Armstrong, and only allowed the ideas to come to fruition after Armstrong's death. Feazell claims that the reforms were initially driven by a re-examination of church literature that was mainly spurred by questions posed by church ministers and members.J. Michael Feazell, The Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, Zondervan, 2003, pp. 22‚Äì25. These examinations were done by Tkach and Feazell, but the final decisions and approval of materials for publication were made by Tkach. By 1990, Tkach authorized the formation of a \\"Doctrinal Manual Group\\", consisting of thirteen ministers and Ambassador College faculty members with the mission of assuring doctrinal consistency, refinement, and advice to the Pastor General. Tkach reviewed and made the final decisions on all recommendations made by the group.J. Michael Feazell, The Liberation of the Worldwide Church of God, Zondervan, 2003, pp. 29‚Äì32. The church's traditions of following the Sabbath, the Old Testament holy days, and tithing were initially retained. But some WCG ministers and members continued to express alarm over the doctrinal revisions Tkach had already made, and from time to time some would leave to create dissident branches. They included Tkach's one- time mentor, Roderick C. Meredith, who formed the Global Church of God in 1992.John Trechak, \\"Rod Meredith Becomes Contender for Church of God Crown\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 52, June 1993. As various breakaway groups were established, additional clusters of church members followed. ==Christmas Eve sermon== The doctrinal changes in the church occurred gradually, but by 1994, most of the concepts of Armstrongism had been largely modified or discontinued. However, the major bombshell was dropped during what is now called the Christmas Eve Sermon.For the text of the sermon, see Tapes of Tkach's sermon (dated January 7, 1995) were delivered to local congregations for viewing. In this sermon, he publicly declared that the Worldwide Church of God was a New Covenant church and, therefore, not bound by the terms of the Old Covenant.Joseph Tkach Jr., Transformed by Truth, Chapter 2, Multnomah, 1997. Christian theology defines the Old Covenant as the Mosaic Law embodied in the Torah. Hence, by making this statement, Tkach officially dropped all doctrines based on Mosaic Law (i.e., the keeping of the Sabbath, the Holy Days, and the dietary laws), making observance of such practices an individual choice. He also dropped the requirement of tithing, declaring that giving as taught in the New Testament was voluntary. The last change had a significant and rather immediate impact on church finances.John Trechak, \\"Tkach Says Sabbath, Holy Days, Tithing Not Mandatory!\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 57, January 1995. These and other major changes brought about major defections among ministers and members, which in turn contributed to a further drop in church revenue. In order to bring the finances in order, major changes in the church infrastructure were implemented. The World Tomorrow, which had seen record numbers of viewers in the early years of the Tkach administration, was stopped.John Trechak, \\"No More World Tomorrow\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 55, May 1994. The Plain Truth publication runs were reduced. Staff at the church headquarters were laid off. The famous, church-subsidized Ambassador Auditorium concert series was canceled and offers were sought for the purchase of the Ambassador College Pasadena campus.John Trechak, \\"Cuts, Cuts, and More Cuts\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 58, April 1995. ==Final days== The Christmas Eve sermon only accelerated the departure of church members. A new branch, the United Church of God, was created in 1995 by a conference of departing ministers and named Tkach's one-time associate and former The World Tomorrow presenter, David Hulme, as president.John Trechak, \\"'The Uniteds'\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 59, June 1995. It eventually became the largest of the groups to break away from the WCG during this period. Although revenues continued to drop, Tkach remained steadfastly committed to the changes that he had implemented. On May 12, 1995 Tkach had surgery to remove his gall bladder. Shortly thereafter, he was readmitted to the hospital because of severe intestine and back pain. Surgeons then removed a grapefruit-size tumor from his intestines and discovered he had colon cancer. In a letter to ministers, dated September 6, Tkach announced that he was also diagnosed with bone cancer. He elected not to undertake radiation treatments. As Armstrong had done before him, Tkach named a successor to become pastor general in the event of his death. In that case, it was Tkach's son, Joseph Tkach Jr.John Trechak, \\"Tkach Sr. Dies of Cancer\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 60, October 1995.Mac Overton, \\"Joseph Tkach Sr. battles bone cancer, names son successor\\", In Transition, Volume 1 Issue 6. Tkach died on September 23, 1995. ==Assessment== WCG revenue in millions of dollars from 1987‚Äì1997. Note the peak in 1990 midway through Tkach's tenure and its decline through to 1997.Sources of data: Ambassador Report, issues 43, 50, 51, 56, and 58, The Worldwide News January 1998 and November 1998, and Joseph Tkach Jr., Transformed by Truth, Chapter 5, Multnomah, 1997. The impact of Tkach's tenure as the head of the WCG was notable. Church income dropped from a high of over $200 million in 1990 to $50 million by 1996.John Trechak, \\"Tkach Jr. Downsizes WCG\\", Ambassador Report, Issue 61, March 1996. By then the church could only count 49,000 as members, less than half from its peak. The circulation of The Plain Truth, distributed free by subscription and via newsstand distribution around the globe, fell from a peak of 8,000,000 to less than 100,000 before it switched to a paid subscription status. Eventually the magazine was spun off into a separate, independent, evangelical ministry.Plain Truth Ministries The number of employees at the church headquarters fell from 1,000 to about 50. Ambassador University, as the college had become after earning regional accreditation in Texas, ceased operations in 1997 as the church could no longer provide its annual operating subsidy. The Pasadena campus was finally sold in 2004. In assessing the work of Tkach, there are two points of view. The critics of Tkach, especially those who formed the splinter churches, see Tkach as the key person responsible for the collapse of the WCG. They believe that the changes he brought were a turn against God and say his rejection of Armstrong's unique doctrines were, at best, without biblical foundation. Tkach's supporters, including those in the leadership of the WCG, see events differently. The WCG describes Tkach's tenure as \\"A Decade of Painful Change\\" and that the end result of his work was the reconciliation of the church with mainstream Christianity. Ruth Tucker, an evangelical leader and an early supporter of the changes which occurred in the WCG, wrote in an article in Christianity Today that > The \\"changes\\"‚Äîas they are referred to by insiders‚Äîare truly historic. Never > before in the history of Christianity has there been such a complete move to > orthodox Christianity by an unorthodox fringe church. Vern Bullough, a secular humanist and senior editor of Free Inquiry, commented on the significance of the changes noting: > The shedding of almost every doctrine the Worldwide Church of God once clung > to is a story almost without parallel in American religious history. After his death, the WCG reiterated its full acceptance of the doctrinal changes implemented by Tkach and published an apology to current and former members of the church for the impact previous doctrines had had on members. Published in the March/April 1996 issue of The Plain Truth. As evidence that Tkach's work was instrumental in the move toward mainstream Christianity, the WCG was accepted into the membership of the National Association of Evangelicals within two years of his death. ==NotesReferences== * Feazell, J.

The ratio relates the aircraft airspeed to the rudder deflection setting that is in effect at the time. As an aircraft accelerates, the deflection of the rudder needs to be reduced proportionately within the range of the rudder pedal depression by the pilot. This automatic reduction process is needed because if the rudder is fully deflected when the aircraft is in high-speed flight, it will cause the plane to sharply and violently yaw, or swing from side to side, leading to loss of control and rudder, tail and other damages, even causing the aircraft to crash. ==See also== *American Airlines Flight 587 Category:Aerospace engineering Category:Engineering ratios ","title":"Rudder ratio"},{"id":"2220573","text":"The organ pipe mud dauber (Trypoxylon politum) is a predatory wasp in the family Crabronidae. They are fairly large wasps, ranging from 3.9‚Äì5.1 cm, and have been recorded to fly from May to September. Female and male are similar in colour, a shiny black with pale yellow to white hind hindtarsomere. The organ pipe mud dauber feeds mainly on three genera of spider: Neoscona, Araneus, and Eustala. Melittobia, a parasitoid wasp, is a common ectoparasite of T. politum prepupae. Other sources of parasitism include the Bombyliid fly Anthrax, Chrysidid wasps, and various species of scavenger flies (Miltogramminae). The tufted titmouse (Parus bicolor) is a known predator of T. politum, and may feed on them more commonly than previously thought as the holes made by the titmouse are similar in shape and size to those made by T. politum leaving the nest after pupation. Organ pipe mud daubers are also an exceedingly docile species of wasp, and generally pleasant to have around, as they serve to keep spider populations down. Stings to humans are only in self- defence, such as if a wasp is squeezed. There are a great many other species in the genus Trypoxylon (over 700 worldwide), mostly smaller in size and less abundant. ==Distribution and habitat== The Organ pipe mud dauber ranges from Southeastern Canada to Eastern United States Mud daubers use tree holes or the underside of bridges to construct their nests out of mud. Nest site choice usually depends on 3 specifications: a smooth vertical surface with ample shade and rainfall protection, a source of mud nearby, as well as an adjacent forest. The females form long mud tubes consisting of multiple cells, which they will fortify with paralyzed spiders. The female then lays an egg in each cell, leaves the nest and, once hatched, the larvae feed on the spiders. The larvae then pupate until they become adults. A female can either; build a new nest, use an abandoned one, challenge another female making one and claim it as her own, or (on rare occasion) enter a freshly constructed one and remove the egg to replace it with her own. The female constructs, on average, 5 to 6 pipes in a cluster. These pipes can either be built side-by-side or on top of each other. When pipes are added in layers, the survivability of the freshly hatched adults decreases as they chew their way out of a pipe to emerge. The more pipes clustered on top of another, the less likely the new mud daubers are to chew their way out alive. A newly hatched adult female will usually begin building her new nest within 48 hours of leaving the old nest. ==Life history== In the southern populations, T. politum has a partially bivoltine life history pattern: Some wasps in these populations have offspring which emerge after winter, before the end of June. Other offspring in this geographical range overwinter and reproduce after winter. North of central Virginia the wasps have a univoltine life history pattern, and only produce one generation per year ==Behaviour== Mud daubers are unique, compared to many other wasps, in that males stay at the mouth of the nest to protect the offspring. The male guards the young from intruders, parasites, and other males. This energy investment, to increase the likelihood in the survivability of their offspring, is known as parental care, and is common among many other hymenopteran, such as bees and ants. The male may also help the female in nest construction. Like other wasps, T Politum is haplodiploid. The unfertilized eggs generate males and fertilized eggs become females. Adult mothers feed the fertilized (female) eggs more than the unfertilized eggs. Because of this additional food allotment, females tend to be the larger of the two sexes. This uneven division of resources is called sex allocation. Females showed a positive correlation between body size and increased fecundity, which offers an explanation as to why there is a bias for increased female food provision and body size. ==Gallery== Organ Pipe Wasp nest.jpgNew organ pipe wasp nest showing different muds gathered at different places Image:Gathering mud 3552.jpgAn organ pipe wasp gathering mud in South Carolina File:Paralyzed spiders extracted from nest cell of organ pipe mud dauber wasp.jpgParalyzed spiders taken from a cell in an organ pipe wasp nest Image:Trypoxylon figulus.jpgTrypoxylon figulus.

As the name suggests, cooperative games stress cooperation over competition.. This type of board game attracts people who enjoy the social aspect of games and is a good way to get new board game players interested in the hobby. Either the players win the game by reaching a pre-determined objective, or all players lose the game, often by not reaching the objective before a certain event ends the game.https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2023/cooperative-play == Definition == In cooperative board games, all players win or lose the game together. These games should not be confused with noncompetitive games, such as The Ungame, which simply do not have victory conditions or any set objective to complete. While adventure board games with role playing and dungeon crawl elements like Gloomhaven may be included, pure tabletop role- playing games like Descent: Journeys in the Dark are excluded as they have potentially infinite victory conditions with persistent player characters. Furthermore, games in which players compete together in two or more groups, teams or partnerships (such as Axis & Allies, and card games like Bridge and Spades) fall outside of this definition, even though there is temporary cooperation between some of the players. Multiplayer conflict games like Diplomacy may also feature temporary cooperation during the course of the game. These games are not considered cooperative though, because players are eliminated and ultimately only one individual can win. == History and development  20th century === Early cooperative games were used by parents and teachers in educational settings.https://cooperativegames.com/a-brief-history-of-cooperative-games/ In 1954, a board game version of Beat the Clock, a game show, was released.https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9774/beat-clock-game In 1956, the Lowell Toy Manufacturing Corporation of New York City released a board game version of I've Got a Secret, a panel show, featuring host Garry Moore on the cover of the box.

He founded Family Pastimes in 1972 in Perth, Ontario,https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7893/togetherhttps://familypastimes.ca/working- together-the-origins-of-cooperative-play/ focusing exclusively on cooperative games. Family Pastimes has published numerous cooperative games, having released over 100 board games including the popular game of Max the Cat. The company also holds the trademark for the phrase, \\"A co-operative game\\".https://familypastimes.ca/a-valley-gamemaker/ Ken Kolsbun and Jann Kolsbun founded Animal Town in 1976 in California.

Pandora, Time Tripper, and Arkham Horror were published. In the Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective series of games published in the 1980s, players are presented with a mystery to solve, and they trace the evidence together. Many cooperative Adventure board game series with Role-playing elements like Citadel of Blood, HeroQuest, Wizards (board game), Advanced HeroQuest, Deathmaze were released in this decade. Minion Hunter is a board game originally released in 1992 by Game Designers' Workshop in conjunction with their Dark Conspiracy Role Playing Game.

Zagal, Jochen Rick, and Idris Hsi's \\"Collaborative games: Lessons learned from board games\\", the lessons the researchers learned highlight what makes a good cooperative board game. * First, the game needs to point out the folly of being competitive by allowing players to make decisions that benefits themselves rather than the whole group. * Second, each player should not need the input of the rest of the group when making a decision. * Third, players need to be able to identify what actions had benefits or consequences. * Fourth, the game should reward selfless players by giving players unique roles or traits. These researchers also point out Challenges in designing collaborative games due to the following pitfalls that must be overcome: * game degenerating into a single player decides the actions for everyone * For a game to be engaging, players should invested in the end result and winning the game should be satisfying * For repeat play, game experience should vary and challenge needs to evolve === Game as the opponent === Participants typically play against the game. Cooperative board games generally involve players joining forces against the game itself, and can be played without any player in the role of the opposition or Gamemaster. In Pandemic, for example, players work together to stop and cure different strains of diseases. Also, in some cooperative games, players actually cooperate with the opposing forces in the game. For example, in Max the Cat, players are mice who keep an aggressive cat at bay by offering him milk and other appeasements. In this way, all participants in the conflict scenario are fulfilled and the resolution is truly cooperative or \\"win-win\\". === Randomness === In many contemporary cooperative games, randomizing devices help in varying game experience over multiple plays. Dice can be rolled, cards can be drawn each turn from a shuffled deck or various board sections of a modular board revealed to generate random objectives, events and challenges. These provide the conflict or challenge in the game, and make it progressively more difficult for the players. For example, in Save the Whales, players work together to protect whales from the challenges inherent in the game setting‚Äîradioactive waste, commercial whaling, etc. === Focus on the Theme === Themes and objectives in cooperative games are either or both of grand scale and highly detailed. This brings an investment in the games objective and the satisfaction of succeeding against the overwhelming magnitude of the odds. The outcome of the effort is often uncertain until the very end, the games try to maintain (and often build) interest and tension. === Cooperation and its Variations === Scotland Yard board Most cooperative games bestow different abilities or responsibilities upon the players incentivizing cooperation. Some cooperative games might have an added layer of intrigue by giving players personal win conditions. In Dead of Winter: A Cross Roads Game, a zombie apocalypse game, in order to win players must achieve the communal victory condition and a personal objective. Gloomhaven is a cooperative board game for 1 to 4 players designed by Isaac Childres and published by Cephalofair Games in 2017 where each player also has a personal objective.  Secret Opponent  In Scotland Yard and The Fury of Dracula have one player secretly controls the enemy. The other players are cooperating to locate and defeat the enemy.  Traitor  A traitor game can be seen as a cooperative game with a betrayal mechanism, or as a kind of team game. For this mechanism, traitors begin the game with hidden identities, or are assigned them during the game. Traitors typically win if the other players lose. In Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game, players who receive a ‚ÄúYou Are a Cylon‚Äù card when loyalty cards are handed out work in secret to undermine humanity. Other games, like Betrayal at House on the Hill, start out fully cooperative, but assigns a player to be the villain mid-game. Such games may be separated from Cooperative board games.https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2023/str-02-cooperative- games == See also == *Cooperative game (in mathematical game theory) *Cooperative gameplay (in video games) *Eurogame *Amerigame *Board wargame == References == Category:Board game gameplay and terminology Category:Cooperative games ","title":"Cooperative board game"},{"id":"2220592","text":"William St John Fremantle Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton, KP, PC, DL (14 December 185613 February 1942), styled as St John Brodrick until 1907 and as Viscount Midleton between 1907 and 1920, was a British Conservative and Irish Unionist Alliance politician. ==Background and education== Brodrick came of a mainly south-west Surrey family who in the early 17th century, in Sirs St John and Thomas Brodrick, were granted land in the south of Ireland, mainly in County Cork. The former settled at Midleton, between Cork and Youghal in 1641; and his son Alan Brodrick (1660‚Äì1728), Speaker of the Irish House of Commons and Lord Chancellor of Ireland, was created Baron Brodrick in 1715 and Viscount Midleton in 1717 in the Irish peerage. In 1796 the title of Baron Brodrick in the Peerage of Great Britain was created. The English family seat at Peper Harrow, near Godalming, Surrey, was designed by Sir William Chambers. His father The 8th Viscount Midleton was a conservative in politics, holding seats West Surrey and Guildford in the House of Commons (November 1885January 1906), and who was responsible in the House of Lords for carrying the Infant Life Protection Act, 1872, which helped regulate the practise of baby farming. William was educated at Windlesham, Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, where he served as president of the Oxford Union. He was awarded a Doctorate of Laws (LLD) by Trinity College, Dublin. He owned, in submissions from his landowning heyday, about . He maintained three homes: Peper Harow (House); 34 Portland Place, London (telephone number on the Langham exchange); Midleton (House), Ireland. His family-settled land was probated before his widow's death in 1943 at and ¬£55,624 in other assets in 1942.https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk Calendar of Probates and Administrations, 1942 and 1943 ==Political career== Brodrick entered Parliament as Conservative member for West Surrey in 1880. In 1883 he was appointed to a Royal Commission examining the condition of Irish prisons. He was Financial Secretary to the War Office 1886‚Äì92; Under-Secretary of State for War, 1895‚Äì1898; Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, 1898‚Äì1900; Secretary of State for War, 1900‚Äì1903; and Secretary of State for India, 1903‚Äì05. He was Secretary of State for War during most of the Second Boer War (1899‚Äì1902). He thus had the responsibility of defending the British use of concentration camps in parliament. The conflict itself showed that the British army was not prepared for the guerrilla war of the Boers. He therefore initiated (though successors played a bigger part) a period of reform of the British army, which was focused on lessening the emphasis placed on mounted units in combat. In September 1902, Brodrick and Lord Roberts, the Commander-in-Chief of the army, visited Germany as guests to attend the German army maneuvers. In 1904, during a crisis in British relations with Russia, he became the first member of a Cabinet since 1714 to attend a meeting of the Privy Council without being summoned to it by the monarch.Sir Almeric Fitzroy, Memoirs (London & New York, 1925), vol. I, p. 222. At the general election of January 1906, the outcome of which was a Liberal win (the biggest landside except for that of the 1931 National Government's Conservatives), he lost his Parliamentary seat, at Guildford, which he had held since 1885. From March 1907 to 1913 he was an alderman of London County Council. From 1910 he was regarded as the nominal leader of the Irish Unionist Alliance (IUA) in Southern Ireland, while Sir Edward Carson led the party in Ulster (the Ulster Unionist Council). Many Irish followers and sympathisers saw him has remote or condescending, reliant on a few intimates and suspected he was more interested in promotion in British politics. In 1916 Midleton's lobbying helped to defeat an attempt to implement immediate Home Rule with Ulster exclusion; this was supported by the Ulster leader Edward Carson and the Home Ruler John Redmond, but Midleton believed it would be disastrous for the Southern Unionist minority, and called attention to the need to protect them from discriminatory taxation. In 1918, during the second, final year of his service on the Irish Convention, he tried to reach a compromise with Redmond which would allow Home Rule without partition subject to certain financial restrictions. This was rejected both by Redmond's followers (who saw it as too restrictive) and the hardline IUA rank-and-file, who deposed Midleton. He and his followers then formed the Unionist Anti- Partition League, an elite body mainly concerned with lobbying. It had some influence on the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, but none of the safeguards for Southern Unionist interests which it sought were included in the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty. Successful lobbying by Midleton and associated Southern Unionists was instrumental in ensuring their representation in the Seanad of the Irish Free State.Letters to Lord Midleton 1917-1922 (Provost of Trinity College to Midleton) PRO 30/67 (Midleton Papers), National Archives. https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/N13987842 His speeches and/or questions in Parliament were in each year from 1880 to 1941 except 1906 when he held no seat, and numbered 7,584, the last of which was a tribute to the passing of Lord Baden Powell.https://api.parliament.uk/historic- hansard/people/mr-william-brodrick/index.html ==Honours and awards== Midleton was sworn into the Privy Counsel as of 1897. During his 1902 visit to Germany, he received the Grand Cross of the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle. He received the Honorary Freedom and was appointed a Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Broderers in 1902, his family having been associated with the company since the early 17th century. He was appointed a Knight of the Order of St Patrick (KP) on 18 April 1916. In the 1920 New Year Honours he was elevated in the British peerage system to Earl of Midleton, which became extinct with the death of his son in 1979.

Holter donated the rights to his invention to medicine. ==Early life and education== Holter was born February 1, 1914 in Helena, Montana. He graduated from Carroll College in 1931 and then continued his studies at University of California Los Angeles, graduating from there with a master's degree in physics in 1937. He then graduated a year later from the University of Southern California with a master's degree in chemistry. He continued his education by completing postgraduate work at the University of Heidelberg (Germany), the University of Chicago, the Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies, and the University of Oregon Medical School. ==Career== During World War II, Holter served as senior physicist in the U.S. Navy, studying the characteristics of waves. In 1946, he headed a government research team involved in the atomic-bomb testing at Bikini Atoll. After the war, he continued work with the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and served as president of the Society of Nuclear Medicine from 1955 to 1956. In 1964, he became a full professor at the University of California, San Diego, coordinating activities at the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics. In 1979, the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) awarded Holter with the AAMI Foundation Laufman-Greatbatch Prize for his contributions to medical technology. Holter was the son and grandson, respectively, of Montana pioneers Norman B. Holter and Anton M. Holter. Anton M. Holter was born in his native Norway and emigrated to the United States when he was 23. Numerous landmarks in and around Helena, Montana bear his family's name.

He was the second-born son of the politician Eleftherios Venizelos. During World War I he served with distinction in the Greek Army and in the initial phases of the Asia Minor campaign, reaching the rank of Captain of Infantry. He resigned from the Army and was elected as an MP with his father's Liberal Party in the 1920 elections. In 1941, after the Axis occupation of Greece, he became ambassador to the United States, representing the Greek government in exile based in Cairo. He became a minister of that government in 1943 under Prime Minister Emmanuel Tsuderos, and briefly its Prime Minister in 1944 (April 13‚Äì26). After the end of the war, he returned to Greece; where he became Vice President of the Liberal Party (led by Themistoklis Sofoulis) and a minister in the first post-war government led by Georgios Papandreou. In 1948 he assumed the leadership of the party and became a minister in a number of short-lived liberal governments led by Papandreou and Nikolaos Plastiras; he was also the Prime Minister of two such governments. In 1954 his longtime friendship with Georgios Papandreou was shaken, and he formed the rival Liberal Democratic Union coalition. The rift was bridged in 1958, and in 1961 he became a founding member of Papandreou's Center Union party, which he served until his death in 1964. Venizelos died on the passenger ship Hellas in the Aegean Sea, en route from Chania to Piraeus. His grave lies next to his father's on the island of Crete.

Milutin built the church as his mausoleum (burial place), and it is where he was first laid to rest. However, following the Battle of Kosovo (1389), his body was moved to Trepƒça and then in 1460 to Sofia (Bulgaria), where it lies to this day. The monastery shared the fate of its founder. The monumental building with its church, library, monks' quarters and \\"imperial palace\\" began to fall into disrepair very early. At the beginning of the 15th century, a fire destroyed the library and in the second half of the same century, the monastery was probably abandoned. Benedikt Kupre≈°iƒá, a traveller, mentioned that the monastery was razed to the ground in the 16th century on the orders of the Ottoman Sultan, as Christians who had fled Ottoman tyranny were gathering in it. St Stephen's, almost totally destroyed, was turned into a mosque in the 19th century and served as such until World War I. The first conservation activity was carried out in 1939 and again in 1990 when the church was partly rebuilt. The monastery is one of the few for which the founding charter has been preserved; it was granted a large estate at its founding, of 75 villages and 8 pastures. As the complex was built as the final resting place of a king, the bishopric was \\"upgraded\\" to a stavropegial monastery - roughly translated, an Imperial monastery, fourth by rank in the state (after Studenica, Mile≈°eva and Sopoƒáani). The building works were led by Archbishop Danilo II, https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/52545699/Zograf_40_05_Cubrovic_72dpi.pdf?1491664705=&response- content- disposition;=inline%3B+filename%3DKo.pdf&Expires;=1601748491&Signature;=ZWIDkfWxgQF0RA2wjQpxrtNORKOtuOm~mYSMdbgndyykykQt9SM3TwUOkL994ByCzGrbFM6NAeo30tdKE3ZNnjMp- NzPpOAtEmiWzrNKf-broGHsNF2urt33ifIrXF0DBWpsh7~X2Xd6xhrID- jKAkXY8WMrPyPkw8SB~KcBuKNDsEdJSNZv5hjaolBXGRH6KRq6TJMSTAoTUGTsMUj4-hKRJrBWkWxQiVH6Ls6q03R3OxthZFHLnFXQLpGdsYW06S9Xr279SYChoUzHu6Uw0QZWfS24GfgpN~M54w29IHu3qfY07R9fPW7vyX5CM9BUOrmSAvqd87biK9kj3p7YlQ__&Key- Pair-Id;=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA at that time a prior, later Serbian Archbishop, who was a close confidant to the king.

John Lawrence, Viceroy of India and other council members. c. 1864 Sir John Strachey (5 June 1823 ‚Äì 19 December 1907) was an English civil servant in British India. ==Life== The fifth son of Edward Strachey, second son of Sir Henry Strachey, 1st Baronet, he was born in London, England. After passing through the East India Company College, Strachey entered the Bengal civil service in 1842, and served in the North- Western Provinces, occupying a number of important positions. In 1861, Lord Canning appointed him president of a commission to investigate the great cholera epidemic of that year. In 1862 he became judicial commissioner in the Central Provinces. In 1864, after the report of the royal commission on the sanitary condition of the army, a permanent sanitary commission was established in India, with Strachey as president. In 1866, he became Chief Commissioner of Oudh, having been chosen by Lord Lawrence to remedy as far as possible the injustice done after the Indian rebellion of 1857 by the confiscation of the rights of tenants and small proprietors of land, maintaining at the same time the privileges of the Talukdars of great landlords. As member of the legislative council he introduced several bills for that purpose, which, with the full approval of the Talukdars, passed into law. In 1868, he became a member of the governor-general's council, and on the assassination of Lord Mayo in 1872 he acted temporarily as viceroy. In 1874 he was appointed lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces. In 1876, by request of Lord Lytton and the secretary of state, he consented to relinquish that office, and returned to the governor-general's council as financial minister, which post he retained until 1880. During this time, while Lord Lytton was viceroy, important reforms were carried out. The measures for decentralizing financial administration, initiated under Lord Mayo, were practically completed. The salt duties were reduced, and the system under which they were levied was altered, and that opprobrium of the administration, the inland customs line, was abolished. The removal of all import duties, including those on English cotton goods, and the establishment of complete free trade, was declared to be the fixed policy of the government, and this was in great measure carried into effect before 1880, when Strachey left India. The system under which military accounts were kept occasioned an erroneous estimate of the cost of the Second Afghan War of 1878‚Äì80. For this error Strachey was technically responsible; it was made the occasion of a partisan attack, which resulted in his resignation. From 1885 to 1895 Strachey was a member of the council of the secretary of state for India. He died in 1907. ==Works== Strachey was joint author with his brother Lt-Gen Sir Richard Strachey of The Finances and Public Works of India (1882), besides writing India (3rd ed., 1903), and Hastings and the Rohilla War (1892). He also planned & designed the construction of The Rail-cum-Road Bridge on River Yamuna in Agra. Unfortunately he didn't get to see the completion of the Arch Bridge as he passed away in 1907. The bridge was completed in 1908, taking 10 years to complete since its construction commenced in 1898. The long bridge was named after John Strachey as Strachey Bridge. It is still functional even being 112 years old carrying trains in Agra Cantonment Railway Station on Delhi - Bhopal Main line to Tundla Junction Railway station in Delhi - Howrah Main Line. ==Family== Strachey married Katherine Batten, daughter of Joseph Batten, Principal of the East India Company College, on 9 October 1856,Descent and Alliances of Croslegh et. al. by Charles Croslegh, privately printed at The De La More Press, London, 1904 pp.330‚Äì3 and they had eight children. They included Sir Arthur Strachey (1858‚Äì1901), judge in India. Their daughter Winifred married Hugh Shakespear Barnes. ==See also== *Strachey Baronets ==ReferencesSources== * Category:1823 births Category:1907 deaths Category:Civil servants from London Category:Knights Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India Category:Companions of the Order of the Indian Empire Category:British East India Company civil servants John (civil servant) Category:English male writers ","title":"John Strachey (civil servant)"},{"id":"2220670","text":"Front view of fort S√£o Jo√£o Baptista in 1917 The Fort of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista de Ajud√° (in English: Fort St. John the Baptist of OuidahUp to about the mid-20th century, the usual spelling of the town in English had been Whydah. Following the accession to independence of Dahomey (non Benin), Ouidah has now become the norm.) is a small restored fort in Ouidah, Benin. Built in 1721, it was the last of three European forts built in that town to tap the slave trade of the Slave Coast. Following the legal abolition of the slave trade early in the 19th century, the Portuguese fort lay abandoned most of the time until it was permanently reoccupied in 1865. In the aftermath of the creation of the French colony of Dahomey in the 1890s, the French authorities recognized Portuguese sovereignty over the fort due to the adamant insistence of Portugal. The fort was garrisoned by a small detachment of troops from Portuguese S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe until 1911. After that, only the residente (governor), his assistant and their families inhabited the fort. Portuguese sovereignty was maintained over the minuscule enclave entirely surrounded by French Dahomey until it was seized by the authorities of the newly independent Republic of Dahomey (now B√©nin) in August 1961. By then the enclave had become an international oddity. The 1958 edition of the Guinness World Records stated: \\"The smallest colony in the world is the Portuguese enclave in the French West African territory of Dahomey, consisting of the Fort of St. John the Baptist (S√£o Jo√£o Baptista de Ajud√°). This has been occupied since 1680 and is garrisoned by one officer and a few men.\\"Fortaleza de S√£o Jo√£o Baptista de Ajud√° Location of the Portuguese fort of Ouidah ==History== Plan of the fort dating from 1721 ===Background=== Following the capture of Elmina Castle and their other forts and factories along the Gold Coast by the Dutch in 1637 and the following years, the Portuguese found themselves without any establishments they could call their own on the shores of the Gulf of Guinea, an intolerable situation since, even after peace was restored, the Dutch required Portuguese ship captains wishing to trade in the area that they obtain a permit, and they imposed a levy of 10% on their cargo. Consequently, during the last quarter of the 17th century, the Portuguese Crown and the colonial authorities in Brazil and S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe had been discussing building a factory on the Costa da Mina, as the Portuguese called the Slave Coast, to supply slaves to the fast-developing sugar and tobacco plantations around Salvador, Bahia in Brazil.A. F. C. Ryder, \\"The re-establishment of Portuguese factories on the Costa da Mina to the mid Eighteenth Century\\", Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria, Vol. 1, No. 3 (December 1958), p.158‚Äì160 ===Construction of the fort of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista de Ajud√°=== In 1680, a former governor of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, Julian de Campo Barretto, had bought Christiansborg Castle, close to the Costa da Mina, from the acting head of the Danish fortress but following a mutiny by the garrison and the expulsion of Barretto in 1682, the Portugue sold it back to the Danes. In 1680 also, the Prince Regent, the future Pedro II, ordered two ships to build a fortress on the Costa da Mina to \\"open up trade for the Portuguese\\", but while the name of the two ships along with their captains are found in documents, there is no evidence that anything was built. The debate over the construction of a trading fort resurfaced in 1698 when, having been informed that the King of Hueda on the Costa da Mina wished to have the Portuguese build a fort on his territory, Lisbon asked the viceroy of Brazil to seek the opinion of the Bahia trading interests about the feasibility of building such a fort. However, since the Bahia traders asked to be granted a twelve-year monopoly of the slave trade along with certain other privileges, the plan was abandoned.Ryder, p. 159. Daniele Santos de Souza, Tr√°fico, escravid√£o e liberdade na Bahia nos 'anos de ouro' do com√©rcio negreiro (c.1680-c.1790), Salvador, 2018, p. 58‚Äì61 In 1721 the Bahia merchant and shipper interests took advantage of the arrival of a new viceroy, Vasco Fernandes C√©sar de Menezes, to force the issue. Their spokesman and instrument was a Captain Jos√© Torres who, it was said, knew the Costa da Mina slave trade well and proposed to build a fort at Ajuda (Whydah, Ouidah). As an enticement to immediate action, Torres offered to undertake the work and transport the necessary building materials in his own ship at his own expenses. In 1671 the French had established a small factory there and, with the Hueda king's permission, they replaced it with a fort in 1704. The English Royal African Company followed suit in 1692. The viceroy was aware of these facts and was convinced that it was important \\"not to miss this occasion\\" and without waiting for the approval of Lisbon, he authorized Torres to go ahead with his plan. Torres set sail for Ouidah in July 1721 and soon after his arrival a fort was erected by slaves of the Hueda king on a site chosen by him a few hundred yards east of the English fort.de Souza, p. 58‚Äì61 Ryder, p. 160‚Äì161 ===Characteristics of the European forts of Ouidah=== > There are three fortresses here, one French, one English and one Portuguese. > They are all built according to the same plan.

Une ville > africaine singuli√®re, √âditions Karthala, Paris, 1995, p. 91. In contrast to the imposing and militarily stronger fortresses found elsewhere along the West African coast that were built in solid material and roofed with tiles, the British William's Fort, the French Fort Saint-Louis and the Portuguese Forte S√£o Jo√£o Baptista, roughly 100 meters square each and lying 300 to 500 meters from each other, had been built in dried mud by African labour using local masonry methods. While the 20-feet deep moats, the thickness of the earthen walls ‚Äì two to three meters ‚Äì as well as the cannons atop the bastions did represent a respectable defensive potential, they were not built to sustain serious attacks. The fact that the buildings were roofed with thatch made them particularly vulnerable to fire. Earthen fortifications deteriorated quickly and therefore needed constant reconstruction. In the 18th century, it became almost a ritual for a new director to complain about the sorry state in which he found the installations. Given the building material used, it was easy to add or eliminate buildings or modify the shape of the bastions. Eventually, wood and locally made bricks would be used for door frames and to reinforce bastions and gunpowder magazines.Sinou, p. 90‚Äì93. Robin Law, the foremost historian of the Slave Coast slave trade referred to the Ouidah forts as \\"permanently organized fortified factories\\". ===Vulnerability of the forts=== The fort of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista de Ajud√° in 1890 The kings of Hueda, and later Dahomey, did not allow European forts and factories on the seaside. Consequently, the three forts, located about 4 km inland, were particularly vulnerable to \\"vexations\\" by the kings and their agents and were dependent on their goodwill. A brief submitted to the British Parliament in the early 18th century lamented that \\"owning forts drew companies into the expensive complexities of African politics, and required the payment of ground-rents, presents, bribes and loans\\", and more so in Ouidah. The Portuguese military engineer Jos√© Ant√≥nio Caldas who stayed at Ouidah around 1759 wrote that due to their being at some distance from the beach, the three forts were \\"subject to the insults of the king of Dahomey\\". Each year, the directors of the three forts were required to travel Abomey, 100 km north of Ouidah, to pay their respect to the king during the annual festivities called ‚Äúcustoms‚Äù. During the troubled years that followed the capture of Ouidah by the king of Dahomey in 1727, all three forts were heavily damaged or destroyed at one time or another, but eventually rebuilt. In 1743, King Tegbesu, suspecting that the director of the Portuguese fort, Joao Basilio, had been conspiring with his enemies, had him imprisoned and expulsed, and the Portuguese fort was destroyed by the explosion of the gunpowder magazine during a subsequent assault by Dahomean troops.Fearing that the Portuguese might stop trading with him and wishing to restore the profitability of the fort, the King began the reconstruction of the fort, and even requested the captain of a Portuguese ship to supply a flag to fly over the ruins. Ryder, p. 171‚Äì172.. During the second half of the 18th century, there was a gradual drift of the slave trade away from Ouidah to points east such Porto Novo, Badagry and Olim (Lagos) largely due to the arbitrariness of the Dahomean kings and their close control over the trade, which was driving up the price of slaves.Robin Law, \\"Trade and Politics behind the Slave Coast: The Lagoon Traffic and the Rise of Lagos, 1500-1800\\", The Journal of African History, Vol. 24, No. 3 (1983), p. 344. ===The illegal slave trade=== The legal abolition of the slave trade by Britain, France and Portugal in the early years of the 19th century caused the abandonment or near abandonment of the slave forts. However, starting in the 1830s, British and French trading houses involved in the palm oil export business were allowed to set up their factories in the deserted British and French forts at Ouidah, but the Portuguese fort remained abandoned. Instead, the Brazilian-born Francisco F√©lix de Sousa, who had started out as a clerk and storekeeper at the fort, later taking charge of the fort, became a major player in the illicit slave trade thanks in a large measure to Portuguese and Brazilian connivance. Having helped a younger brother of the ruling Dahomean king to gain the throne under the name Ghezo, he was installed by him as \\"captain of the Whites\\". His nickname chacha (Portuguese: X√†x√†) would from then on be assimilated with the post he, and his sons and grandsons after him, held. Enjoying special privileges with regard to the slave trade, now illegal but nevertheless booming, the chacha , along with three of his sons and other Afro-Brazilian traders, he dominated Brazil's trading network on the Slave Coast. In 1822, he is said to have hoisted the flag of the newly proclaimed Brazilian Empire over the fort, which remained largely unoccupied since he conducted his activities and lived with his wives and many dozens of children in another part of Ouidah.Luis Felipe de Alencastro, \\"Continental drift: the independence of Brazil (1822)\\", in From Slave Trade to Empire. Europe and the Colonisation of Black Africa. 1780s‚Äì1880s, edited by Olivier P√©tr√©-Grenouilleau, Routledge, New York and London, 2004, p. 105‚Äì106 ===Reoccupation of the fort by Portugal=== The fort in 1932 The fort was reoccupied by Portugal in 1865. In this period it served as a base for a brief Portuguese attempt to impose a protectorate on the Kingdom of Dahomey of which the city of Hweda (Ajud√° ‚Äì Ouidah) was part (1885‚Äì1887). Inside view of the restored fort in 2013. The building on the left is the Historical Museum of Ouidah, which used to house the Portuguese residente (governor) of the fort Until its annexation by Dahomey in 1961, exactly one year after it had gained independence, S√£o Jo√£o Baptista de Ajud√° was probably the world's smallest recognized political unit: according to the census of 1921 it had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, only 2 inhabitants represented Portuguese sovereignty. They tried to burn it rather than surrendering. Dahomey's annexation of the fort was formally recognized by Portugal in 1975. == Design == The fort is a small square with towers at its four corners.

He studied at the University of Halle in Germany, and eventually became a professor at the University of Aberdeen. He is best known for his commentary on the Revelation of St. John. He also wrote two other well-known books that are classics: The Resurrection of our Lord and The Ascension of our Lord. ==Early life and ministry== He was born at Edinburgh on 15 March 1821, the eldest of seven children of the Rev. George Milligan and his wife, Janet Fraser. His father, a licentiate of the Church of Scotland, was then engaged in teaching at Edinburgh, and from 1825 lived at 1 Rankeillor Street, in the South Side.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1825 Milligan was sent to the High School, where he was dux of his class. In 1832, when his father became minister of the Fifeshire parish of Elie, he was transferred to the neighbouring parish school of Kilconquhar, and thence proceeded in 1835 to the university of St. Andrews. Though only fourteen years of age, he earned from that day, by private teaching, as much as paid his class-fees, much to his parents' relief, for Elie was a \\"small living.\\" Graduating M.A. in 1839, and devoting himself to the ministry, he took his divinity course partly at St. Andrews and partly at Edinburgh, and for a time he was tutor to the sons of Sir George Suttie of Prestongrange. During the schism known as the Disruption of 1843, Milligan adhered to the Church of Scotland. He wrote to his father that he was resolved to \\"remain in ... and lend any aid he could to those who are ready to unite in building up, on principles agreeable to the word of God, the old church of Scotland.\\" He was at this time assistant to Robert Swan, minister at Abercrombie, and the next year he was presented to the Fifeshire parish of Cameron and ordained. ==Biblical scholar== In 1845, his health gave cause for anxiety, and he obtained a leave of absence for a year, which he spent in Germany, studying at Halle. He made the acquaintance, among others, of August Neander, in whom he found a kindred spirit. Promoted in 1850 to the more important parish of Kilconquhar, and in 1860 he was appointed first professor of biblical criticism in the university of Aberdeen. He worked hard, but his liberal politics and mild broad-church views were not congenial to many of his colleagues, and his amiability concealed from his students the real strength of his character. Nevertheless, his power and influence grew, and in 1870 he joined the company formed for the revision of the English New Testament. From that time onward he was a prolific writer. His style, prolix at first, became pure and graceful, and in such works as those on the resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ and on the Revelation of St. John he took a foremost place among British theologians. In the church courts, too, his rise was steady. In 1872 he was sent, together with the Rev. J. Marshall Lang (now Principal Lang) as a representative from the general assembly of the Church of Scotland to the assembly of the Presbyterian church in the United States; in 1875 he was elected depute-clerk of the general assembly, and in 1886 he succeeded Principal John Tulloch as principal clerk. ==Church of Scotland leadership== Already in 1882, partly in recognition of his work as a New Testament reviser, he had been elevated to the Church of Scotland moderator's chair. His address on the occasion was notable for its declaration that, in any scheme for church reunion in Scotland, the Scottish episcopalians must be considered. While its enunciation of doctrine concerning the church called forth the warm approval of Canon Liddon, who wrote and thanked him for it. Although in his earlier days his humanitarian feelings, and his enthusiasm for liberty and progress, had allied him with those who were then called broad churchmen, Milligan did not have at any period of his career the slightest sympathy with the disregard for doctrine which has sometimes marked the members of that school. Ultimately he ranged himself with high churchmen, being, he declared, impelled to join them by increased study of the New Testament. His doctrine of the church he gathered for himself from the Epistle to the Ephesians, on which he had contributed an important article to the ninth edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. His views on the importance of dogma and on the sacraments he learned, as he believed, from St. John, of whose writings he was a lifelong student and diligent expositor. This development of his opinions in no way limited his width of sympathy, nor did it interfere with the friendly intercourse, ecclesiastical as well as social, that he had been wont to hold with nonconformists with Wesleyans like Dr. W. F. Moulton, or with independents like Principal Fairbairn. He had been a member for years of the Church Service Society. In 1892, when the Scottish Church Society was constituted \\"to defend and advance catholic doctrine as set forth in the ancient creeds, and embodied in the standards of the church of Scotland, &c.;\\", he took an important part in its formation, and accepted office as its first president. The last letter he wrote from his death-bed was to the first conference of this society, then being held in Glasgow. A few days previously he had said that the greatest need of the Church of Scotland was the restoration of a weekly celebration of the eucharist. Milligan was keenly interested in social and especially in educational questions. In 1888 he went to Germany to inquire about technical education and continuation schools in that country; and the next year he visited Sweden to see the working of the Gottenburg licensing system. In Aberdeen, he was an active philanthropist; and all over Scotland his services as a preacher were in much request. When on the eve of retiring from his chair at Aberdeen owing mainly to failing eyesight, Milligan was suddenly seized with illness which soon proved fatal. He died at Edinburgh on 11 December 1893. He is buried in Grange Cemetery in south Edinburgh. The grave lies just west of the central vaults close to the grave of Jessie Gellatly. ==Works== Milligan's literary productiveness began in 1855, when he contributed the first of a series of papers to Kitto's Journal of Sacred Literature. In 1857, he addressed a \\"Letter to the Duke of Argyll on the Education Question.\\" The Decalogue and the Lord's Day (1866) was evoked by the controversy stirred in Scotland by a speech of Dr. Norman MacLeod's, as his Words of the New Testament (1873)‚Äîwritten in conjunction with Dr. Roberts‚Äîbelonged to the literature of New Testament revision. In 1878, appeared a volume on the Higher Education of Women; and the next year he contributed to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica his important article on the Epistle to the Ephesians. The Resurrection of our Lord and his Commentary on St. John (in conjunction with Dr. Moulton) (1882), his Commentary on the Revelation (1883), his Discussions on the Apocalypse (1883), his Baird Lectures on the Revelation of St. John (1886), Elijah (1887), The Resurrection of the Dead (1890), The Ascension and Heavenly Priesthood of our Lord, and his presidential address on the Aims of the Scottish Church Society (1892), were all productions of his ripened powers. Besides these he contributed many articles to periodicals. His last article was a notice In Memoriam of Dr. Hort, which appeared in the Expository Times (1893). ==Family== In 1859 he married Annie Mary Moir, the daughter of David Macbeth Moir. They had several children. His daughter Agnes Milligan married Godfrey Carey. His son Oswald Milligan became a church historian.http://www.churchservicesociety.org/sites/default/files/journals/1941-1942-21-23.pdf He left unfinished a work on the Epistle to the Hebrews, and forbade the publication of the parts he had written; some of his notes, however, have been used in a work on the same subject, since published by his eldest son, the Rev. George Milligan who went on to be Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1923. ==References== Attribution: * ==External links== * * Category:1821 births Category:1893 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of St Andrews Category:British biblical scholars Category:Scottish Calvinist and Reformed theologians Category:Scottish biblical scholars Category:Moderators of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland Category:Ministers of the Church of Scotland ","title":"William Milligan"},{"id":"2220674","text":"Le T√©m√©raire L'Inflexible The Strategic Ocean Force () has been the synonym of the French Submarine Forces since 1999, which the commandant commands the ensemble related to, along with the squadron of nuclear attack submarine ().

FOST has been placed under the commandment of a g√©n√©ral naval officer () with acronym bearing ALFOST. With the dissolution of the Attack Submarine Group of the Atlantic, ultimate formation regrouping submarines with conventional propulsion, on July 1 1999, the strategic force regroups the ensemble of French submarines. == Force de dissuasion == The Strategic Force was born after the World War II from the will of g√©n√©ral de Gaulle to possess a nuclear arm. The French Nuclear Ballistic Missile Submarines armed with Submarine- launched ballistic missiles, in relation to their discretion in the various oceanic patrol zones, ensure a guaranteed retaliatory nuclear strike (second strike). Since 1985, the strategy of nuclear deterrence in France armed six French Nuclear Ballistic Missile Submarines in service, five in service since 1991, and four since 1997; maintaining a permanent presence around the Oceans and Seas. Deterrence is ensured in 2014 by the permanent deployment of the French Nuclear Ballistic Missile Submarines of the Triomphant-class. Between 1972 and April 2014, hundreds of patrols were realized. The first submarine class of French Nuclear Ballistic Missile Submarines in service was the Le Redoutable-class, the head of the series, which was put in dry-docks under authorization in March 1963, with construction commencing in 1964 and was launched on March 29 1967 in presence of President of France Charles de Gaulle. Trials of the latter commenced in 1969 and the boat entered into service on December 1 1971. Six French nuclear ballistic missile submarines of the Le Redoutable class capable of carrying sixteen ballistic missiles were built: * Le Redoutable (1971-1991) * Le Terrible (1973-1996) * Le Foudroyant (1974-1998) * L'Indomptable (1976-2003)L'Indomptable * Le Tonnant (1980-1999) * L'Inflexible (1985-2008) Four French nuclear ballistic missile submarines of a newer generation, the Le Triomphant class, are in service in 2013 in the force oc√©anique strat√©gique of the French Navy: * Le Triomphant (S616) (entered in service since 1997) * Le T√©m√©raire (S617) (entered into service since 1999) * Le Vigilant (S618) (entered into service since 2004) * Le Terrible (S619) (entered into service since 2010). Le Terrible was presented on March 21 2008, and entered service at the end of September 2010 to replace the L'Inflexible, last of the retrieved Le Redoutable class ballistic missile submarine in 2008. The armament systems of the ballistic missile submarines include in general: * 16 missiles M45 with TN 75 heads (nuclear deterrence). French Nuclear deterrence also includes M51 missiles. * 4 tubes of 533mm for F17 torpedoes and Exocet SM39 anti-ship missiles.

He and his Canadian wife moved to Afghanistan in July 2001. They were separated when trying to leave in November 2001 and Zemiri was arrested and turned over to United States forces. He was transferred to the United States Guantanamo Bay detention camp in 2002, where he was detained for eight years without charge.\\"Montrealer sold to U.S. troops: wife: Northern Alliance got $5,000, she says; U.S. alleges Algerian-born Ahcene Zemiri helped millennium bomber Ahmed Ressam , Montreal Gazette reprint of Ottawa Citizen, July 11, 2005 Ahmed Ressam, the terrorist convicted in 2001 of planning the foiled Millennium bombing of the Los Angeles Airport, alleged that Zemiri had been involved in the plot. In late 2006, he recanted his accusation entirely. In January 2010, Zemiri was freed from Guantanamo Bay and repatriated to Algeria. ==Early life and education== Ahcene Zemiri was born in Algeria, where he was raised as a Muslim. As a young man he emigrated to Canada. ==Emigration to Canada== He settled in Montreal in 1994 and became a legal resident. He married Karina Dereshteanu, a Canadian woman, in 1997. ==Move to Afghanistan== In about June 2001, the couple moved to Afghanistan. As fighting increased, in November, they decided to leave because Karina was pregnant. They decided to separate, as they had heard that women and children were being permitted to enter Pakistan safely. They did not see each other again until 2010, years after their son Karim was born. Karina Zemiri believes that bounty hunters picked up her husband and sold him to the Americans, as was commonly done. ==Interrogated by Canadian Security officials in Guantanamo== Zemiri was transferred by the Americans to Guantanamo in 2002. Ahmed Ressam, who had been convicted in 2001 of planning the Millennium bombing of the Los Angeles Airport, alleged that Zemiri was involved in the plot. In 2004, Zemiri was interrogated at Guantanamo by officials of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), after the Canadian government had been informed of his detention. They also interviewed Djamel Ameziane, an Algerian, and Mohamedou Ould Slahi, a Mauritanian, who also were Canadian residents before being captured in Afghanistan and sent to Guantanamo. While some detainees had reported seeing Canadian officials, the government originally denied it. These accounts were not confirmed until July 2008, after the Canadian Supreme Court ordered the release of certain materials related to the case of the Canadian citizen Omar Khadr, then still a detainee at Guantanamo. The Canadian government was reviewing the role of its CSIS agents, as it was concerned they may have colluded with the US during interrogation under torture. In addition, the US Supreme Court had held that the government was illegally detaining persons at Guantanamo in the period when the CSIS agents had interviewed residents there. On July 27, 2008, Michelle Shephard, writing in the Toronto Star, reported that Canadian security officials had interviewed Zemiri and two others at Guantanamo in addition to Khadr. ==Writ of habeas corpus== In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld (2004), the United States Supreme Court ruled that detainees had the right to review of their cases before an impartial tribunal to determine if they were enemy combatants. The Center for Constitutional Rights organized a program of finding United States lawyers who would agree to serve as the lawyers for Guantanamo captives, while serving writs of habeas corpus on their behalf in federal district court to challenge their detention. Lawyers from the firm Fredrikson & Byron of Minneapolis agreed to serve pro bono to represent Ahcene Zemiri and met with him in 2005. In the petition for habeas corpus, they asserted that their client had not been a member of the Taliban, al-Qaeda or other terrorist groups; \\"had no military or terrorist training, and has neither caused nor tried to harm American personnel or property.\\" To respond to the Court, the Bush administration established Combatant Status Review Tribunals, and from the fall of 2004 through 2005, conducted reviews of detainee cases. In part because of the allegations by Ressam that Zemiri was involved in the LAX plot, although he denied it, the U.S. designated Zemiri as an unlawful enemy combatant and recommended his continued detention. == Combatant Status Review  Administrative Review Board === Detainees whose Combatant Status Review Tribunal labeled them \\"enemy combatants\\" were scheduled for annual Administrative Review Board hearings. These hearings were designed to assess the threat a detainee might pose if released or transferred, and whether there were other factors that warranted his continued detention. ==Recanting of Millennium plot== In January 2007, the press reported that Ahmed Ressam, who had been convicted in 2001 of planning the Millennium bombing and alleged that Zemiri was involved in the plot, wrote a letter in November 2006 to the U.S. District Court Judge John C. Coughenour. He said he wanted to \\"clarify\\" his allegations against Zemiri and recanted his previous accusations. Coughenour was the Judge who sentenced Ressam. Ressam wrote: *\\"Mr. Hassan Zemiry is innocent and has no relation or connection to the operation I was about to carry out. He also did not know anything about it and he did not assist me in anything, It is true that I have borrowed some money and a camera from him, but this was only a personal loan between me and him. It has nothing to do with my case...\\" Ressam explained he had offered false information because he \\"was in shock and had a severe psychological disorder.\\" Ressam was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment. Reporters suggested at the time of his trial that he was at risk for a life sentence, which was reduced because he cooperated by naming other suspects, such as Zemiri. According to Jim Dorsey, Zemiri's lawyer, \\"This letter undercuts what is the most damning allegation against my client by far.\\" Dorsey forwarded a copy of Ressam's letter to American military officials at Guantanamo. ==Appeal through the Canadian Justice system== In preparing their habeas corpus cases, the attorneys for Ahcene Zemiri and Mohammedou Slahi, a Mauritanian national who also lived in Canada, appealed through the Canadian Justice system for the release of classified documents about the two men. They were trying to gain access to information gathered by Canada. Both men had been interviewed by Canadian security officials before they went to Afghanistan. The men's lawyers argued that the notes from the men's Canadian interviews would have been used by the United States in building its dossiers against the two men. They had requested the Canadian evidence in order to make their case for the men's freedom in the US Justice system. In 2009, Justice Edmond Blanchard ruled that since the men were not Canadian citizens, and their connection to Canada was \\"tenuous\\", the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms did not apply to them. In a different case, the Supreme Court of Canada had ruled that the Canadian government should publish classified documents which the United States had shared about the Canadian citizen Omar Khadr. Nathan Whitling, one of the men's Canadian lawyers, predicted that the men's American habeas corpus cases in the United States would be heard before the appeal he planned of Blanchard's ruling could get through the court. ==Return to Algeria== Ahcene Zemiri and Adil Hadi al Jazairi Bin Hamlili were returned to Algeria on January 20, 2010, as their country of origin and citizenship. Carol Rosenberg, writing in the Miami Herald, reported that it was not clear whether the two men had been sent home as free men, or whether they were transferred to Algerian security custody. She noted that two other Algerians, former detainees, had been granted asylum in France, because they had reason to fear a return home. == References  * Two Algerian Torture Victims Are Freed from Guant√°namo, Andy Worthington, 25 January 2010 Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:People from Algiers Category:Algerian extrajudicial prisoners of the United States Category:Guantanamo detainees known to have been released Category:Algerian torture victims Category:Algerian emigrants to Canada Category:Algerian emigrants to France ","title":"Ahcene Zemiri"},{"id":"2220687","text":"The Great Western Railway (GWR) 1366 Class was a class of 0-6-0 pannier tank steam locomotive built in 1934. They were a useful design and because of their light weight and short wheelbase and were often used on dockside branches or other lines with sharp curvatures. ==History and development== The 1366 class was one of only two pannier tank designs built by the GWR that utilised outside cylinders, although various existing engines inherited by the GWR had Pannier Tanks and outside cylinders. The 1366 class was developed from the 1361 Class but differed by including a pannier tank rather than a saddle tank, Belpaire firebox, etc. They were designed to replace the 1392 Class. ==Operational history== Preserved no. 1369 Originally five of the six locomotives of the class were allocated to Swindon shed; no. 1371 was originally sent to Llanelly but when they were taken over by British Railways Western Region in 1948 three of the six had been reallocated to Weymouth for use on the docks there. In 1950 the situation remained as it had in 1948 while by 1955 one of the locomotives had moved shed allocation from Swindon to Taunton (although actually used at Bridgwater) with three still remaining at Weymouth and this in turn continued until 1959. With the move from steam to diesel the first of the class to be withdrawn was 1370 which was withdrawn from Weymouth shed in January 1960 followed by 1371 from Swindon shed in November of that year and then 1366 from Taunton the following February. However the three remaining locomotives were offered a new lease of life. No. 1369 was sent via Yeovil to Wadebridge and after successful clearance trials had taken place numbers 1367 and 1368 followed., the locomotives being used to replace the Beattie Well Tanks that had run over the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway to Wenfordbridge for the previous 87 years. However dieselisation caught up with them again, and all three were withdrawn in 1964 having operated for just 2 years in Cornwall. The final locomotive, 1369, left Wadebridge under its own steam for the Dart Valley Railway on 20 February being the last operational British Railways steam locomotive to be based in Cornwall.

The wick effect is a phenomenon that is found to occur under certain conditions, and has been thoroughly observed. It is one commonly offered explanation for the alleged phenomenon of spontaneous human combustion (SHC). ==Details== The wick effect theory says a person is kept aflame through his/her own fats after being ignited, accidentally or otherwise. The clothed human body acts like an \\"inside-out\\" candle, with the fuel source (human fat) inside and the wick (the clothing of the victim) outside. Hence there is a continuous supply of fuel in the form of melting fat seeping into the victim's clothing. Fat contains a large amount of energy due to the presence of long hydrocarbon chains. ==ExamplesMary Reeser case=== Mary Reeser (1884‚Äì1951) of St. Petersburg, Florida was most likely a victim of the wick effect. It was suspected that she'd accidentally ignited herself with a cigarette. The fat which over time had been absorbed by her clothing likely acted as fuel for the fire. At the scene, investigators found melted fat in the rug near Mary's body. ===1963 Leeds case=== An investigation of a 1963 case in Leeds included an experiment with a wick effect. A small portion of human fat was wrapped in cloth to simulate clothing. A Bunsen burner flame was then applied to the 'candle'. Due to the high water content of human fat the flame had to be held on the 'candle' for over a minute before it would catch fire: > \\"One end of the candle was ignited by a Bunsen flame, the fat catching fire > after about a minute. Although the Bunsen was removed at this point, > combustion of the fat proceeded slowly along the length of the roll, with a > smoky yellow flame and much production of soot, the entire roll being > consumed after about one hour.\\" This gives some indication of the slow speed with which the wick effect will proceed. ===1991 Oregon murder=== In February 1991, in woodland near Medford, Oregon, USA, two hikers came across the burning body of a female adult, lying face down in fallen leaves. They alerted the officials and a local deputy sheriff soon arrived. The victim was described as \\"well nourished\\". She had been stabbed several times in the upper regions of the chest and back. Both arms were spread outwards from the torso. The lower legs and surface of the neck showed signs of fire damage. The soft tissues of the right arm, torso and upper legs were consumed. The majority of bones of these parts retained their integrity, although friability was increased. Between mid-chest and knees the fleshy parts of the body were mostly destroyed. Crime scene personnel reported that the pelvis and spine were \\"not recoverable\\", having been reduced to a grey powder. Her killer had soaked the clothes and corpse in nearly a pint of barbecue starter fluid and set her on fire. In the well-oxygenated outdoor environment, this combination of circumstances‚Äîan immobile and clothed body with a high fat-to-muscle ratio, accelerant (lighter fluid), and artificial ignition‚Äîmade it prime for the wick effect to occur. The murderer was arrested and made a full confession. He claimed to have set the body alight some thirteen hours before it was discovered. ===1998 experiment=== A larger scale experiment conducted for the BBC television programme Q.E.D. involved a dead pig's body being wrapped in a blanket and placed in a furnished room. The blanket was lit with the aid of a small amount of petrol. The body took some time to ignite and burned at a very high temperature with low flames. The heat collected at the top of the room and melted a television. However, the flames caused very little damage to the surroundings, and the body burned for a number of hours before it was extinguished and examined. On examination it was observed that the flesh and bones in the burnt portion had been destroyed. ===2006 Geneva case=== In October 2006, the body of a man was discovered at home in Geneva, almost completely incinerated between the mid-chest and the knees, most probably due to heart attack while smoking, followed by the wick effect. The chair containing the body was mostly consumed, but other objects in the room were almost undamaged, albeit covered with a brown oily or greasy coating. The source of the fire was most likely a cigarette or cigar. The man's dog also died in another room of the man's apartment; this was attributed to carbon monoxide poisoning. ===2010 Galway case=== In December 2010, the cremated body of a man was found in his home in Clareview Park at Ballybane in the Irish city of Galway (Parris-Long, 2011). The fire investigators concluded that no accelerants were used and that the open fireplace was not the cause of the fire. The coroner in the case could not identify the cause of the death due to extensive internal organ damage and concluded that \\"this [case] fits into the category of spontaneous human combustion, for which there is no adequate explanation\\". ==References== Category:Fire Category:Spontaneous human combustion pt:Efeito pavio ","title":"Wick effect"},{"id":"2220694","text":"Can't Stop the Music is a 1980 American musical comedy film directed by Nancy Walker. Written by Allan Carr and Bront√© Woodard, the film is a pseudo- biography of disco's Village People that bears only a vague resemblance to the actual story of the group's formation. It was produced by Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment (formerly EMI Films), and distributed by independent distributor Associated Film Distribution (AFD). The film was released after disco's peak and was subsequently a box office flop, winning two of the first ever Razzie Awards for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay. ==Plot== Songwriter Jack Morell‚Äîa reference to Village People creator Jacques Morali‚Äîgets a break DJing at local disco Saddle Tramps. His roommate, Samantha \\"Sam\\" Simpson, is a supermodel newly retired at the peak of her success. She sees the response to a song that he wrote for her (\\"Samantha\\") and agrees to use her connections to get him a record deal. Her connection is her ex-boyfriend Steve Waits, president of Marrakech Records‚Äîa reference to Village People record label Casablanca Records‚Äîwho is more interested in rekindling their romantic relationship than in Jack's music (and more interested in taking business calls than in wooing Samantha), but agrees to listen to a demo. Sam decides that Jack's vocals are not adequate, so she recruits neighbor and Saddle Tramps waiter/go-go boy Felipe Rose (the Indian), fellow model David \\"Scar\\" Hodo (the construction worker, who daydreams of stardom in the solo number \\"I Love You to Death\\"), and finds Randy Jones (the cowboy) on the streets of Greenwich Village, offering dinner in return for their participation. Meanwhile, Sam's former agent, Sydney Channing, orders Girl Friday Lulu Brecht to attend, hoping to lure back the star. Ron White, a lawyer from St. Louis, is mugged by an elderly woman on his way to deliver a cake that Sam's sister sent and arrives disconcerted. Brecht gives Jack drugs, which unnerves him when her friend Alicia Edwards brings singing cop Ray Simpson (the policeman), but Jack records the quartet on \\"Magic Night\\". Ron, pawed all night by the man-hungry Brecht, is overwhelmed by the culture shock of it all and leaves. The next day, Sam runs into Ron, who apologizes, proffers the excuse that he is a Gemini and follows her home. Spilling leftover lasagna on himself, Sam and Jack help him remove his trousers before Jack leaves and Sam and Ron spend the night. Newly interested in helping, Ron offers his Wall Street office to hold auditions. There, Glenn M. Hughes (the leatherman), climbs atop a piano for a rendition of \\"Danny Boy\\", and he and Alex Briley (the G.I.) join the group, now a sextet. They get their name from an offhand remark by Ron's socialite mother Norma. Ron's boss, Richard Montgomery, overwhelmed by the carnival atmosphere, insists that the firm not represent the group, and Ron quits. Ron's new idea for rehearsal space is the YMCA (the ensuing production number \\"YMCA\\" features its athletic denizens in various states of undress; the film is one of the few non-R-rated offerings to feature full-frontal male nudity). The group cuts a demo (\\"Liberation\\") for Marrakech, but Steve sees limited appeal and Sam refuses his paltry contract. Reluctant to use her savings, they decide to self-finance by throwing a pay-party. To bankroll the party, Sam acquiesces to Channing's plea to return for a TV advertising campaign for milk, on the condition that the Village People are featured. The lavish number \\"Milkshake\\" begins as Sam pours milk for six little boys in the archetypal costumes with the promise that they will grow up to be the Village People. The advertisers want nothing to do with such a concept, and refuse to broadcast the spot. Norma then steps in to invite the group to debut at her charity fundraiser in San Francisco. Sam lures Steve by promising a romantic weekend, but Ron is taken aback by the inference that she would go through with the seduction, and Sam ends their romantic relationship. On his private jet, Steve prepares for a tryst, but rather Jack and his former chorine mother Helen arrive to negotiate a contract. Initially reluctant, Helen wins over Steve with her kreplach, and before long they are negotiating the T-shirt merchandising for the Japanese market. In the dressing room before the show, Ron, relieved to learn that Sam did not travel with Steve, proposes to her. At one point, Montgomery appears, seeking to rehire Ron as a junior partner representing the group. Following a set by The Ritchie Family (\\"Give Me a Break\\"), the Village People make a triumphant debut (\\"Can't Stop the Music\\"). ==Cast== * Steve Guttenberg as Jack Morell * Valerie Perrine as Samantha \\"Sam\\" Simpson * Bruce Jenner as Ron White * Paul Sand as Steve Waits * Tammy Grimes as Sydney Channing * Village People: ** Alex Briley as Alex the G.I. ** David Hodo as David the Construction Worker ** Glenn Hughes as Glenn the Leatherman ** Randy Jones as Randy the Cowboy ** Felipe Rose as Felipe the Indian ** Ray Simpson as Ray the Policeman * June Havoc as Helen Morell * Barbara Rush as Norma White * Altovise Davis as Alicia Edwards * Marilyn Sokol as Lulu Brecht * Russell Nype as Richard Montgomery * Jack Weston as Benny Murray * Leigh Taylor-Young as Claudia Walters * Dick Patterson as the Record store manager ==ProductionDevelopment=== Originally titled Discoland...

Los Angeles Times 9 Sep 1979: l29. Allan Carr announced the film in June 1979, describing it as \\"Singing in the Rain for the disco crowd\\" and stating that the film would star the Village People, Valerie Perrine, Tammy Grimes, Chita Rivera, Barbara Rush, Pat Ast and Bruce Jenner. It was to be the first in a three picture slate from Carr, the others including Chicago and The Josephine Baker Story starring Diana Ross. Filming was to start on August 20 of that yearFILM CLIPS: Hollywood's Party Champion Defends His Crown SCHREGER, CHARLES.

When asked why EMI were making a film about disco so long after Saturday Night Fever, Spikings said, \\"I hope it is different. The film breaks new ground.\\"The man who came to film The Guardian 18 July 1979: 10. The film's director, Nancy Walker, a theater, film, and television star since the 1940s, had been nominated for two Tonys, four Golden Globes, and eight Emmys. Walker had guest starred as Rhoda's mother Ida Morgenstern in several episodes of The Mary Tyler Moore Show and continued that role in its spin-off Rhoda. After establishing the character, Walker directed some episodes of both series, along with episodes of other situation comedy series. Can't Stop the Music was her lone effort at film direction, as after it, Walker turned her attention back to acting in television. ===Casting=== The film's supporting cast includes two two-time Tony Award winners, Tammy Grimes and Russell Nype, June Havoc (sister of stripper Gypsy Rose Lee), Altovise Davis (wife of Sammy Davis, Jr.), character actor Jack Weston, and Emmy-winner Leigh Taylor-Young. Chita Rivera and Pat Ast were initially cast but dropped out of the film's production. Can't Stop the Music was Bruce Jenner's film debut after becoming famous for three world record-setting performances in the Decathlon, and a Gold medal win at the 1976 Olympic Games. Jenner's record stood from 1975 until shortly before this film's 1980 release. Jenner did not appear in another film until Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill (2011), which, like Can't Stop the Music, won the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture. Carr said, \\"Jenner is going to be the Robert Redford of the 80s, and this film will do for Valerie what Carnal Knowledge did for Ann-Margret.\\" The Village People auditionees depicted in the film included Blackie Lawless (a member of the glam-punk group New York Dolls and heavy metal group W.A.S.P.) and James Marcel (who would later find greater success with the name James Wilder). Background dancers included Perri Lister, girlfriend of Billy Idol and mother to his son, and Peter Tramm, who would go on to appear in dozens of music videos and double for Kevin Bacon in Footloose. Ray Simpson's role was originally intended for Victor Willis, the original lead singer of the Village People who quit the group during pre-production of this film. Wanting to assert his heterosexuality amongst the gay-themed group, Willis had insisted his then-wife, Phylicia Ayers-Allen, be written into the film as his girlfriend. When he quit the group, Ayers-Allen was fired and replaced by Altovise Davis.Hofler, Robert (2010).

Carr had attempted to cast Grease star Olivia Newton-John in this film as Samantha, but after discussions between her producer, John Farrar, and Morali over who would write Newton-John's numbers, Newton-John instead signed on to play the lead in Xanadu. \\"It wasn't only money,\\" said Carr, \\"it was creative control and other demands.\\" ===Filming=== The schedule of the film was 11 weeks: eight in Los Angeles, two in New York and one in San Francisco. A proposed week of filming on Fire Island was scrapped due to fear of the weather. Producer Allan Carr was coming off a massive worldwide hit with the pop musical Grease when shooting took place between May and July 1979 at the height of the disco craze. Carr took a hands-on role with the production, and personally directed and cast the male athlete extras for the \\"YMCA\\" musical sequence. Shooting took place at MGM Studios in Culver City, California, with location shooting in New York City and San Francisco. Location shooting in New York was somewhat complicated by adjacent protests by gay activists over the William Friedkin film Cruising (starring Al Pacino), which was filming on location nearby. The two productions were mistaken for each other more than once, with protestors disrupting the Can't Stop the Music location shoots when they had intended to halt production of Cruising. A few weeks prior to release, Jenner and Perrine hosted a TV special, Allan Carr's Magic Night, to promote the film. Tensions between Walker and Valerie Perrine rose on the set to the point that Walker would not be present for scenes featuring Perrine, leaving director of cinematography Bill Butler to direct in her place. Additionally, Perrine was reportedly unhappy that a dance number in which she danced was cut from the film.home q&a;: valerie perrine hers is a peaceful life, filled with animals, plants and projects home q&a; home q&a; Peck, Stacey. Los Angeles Times 30 Nov 1980: s70. Carr said he decided to change the title during filming because, as the music score included older ballads and Broadway numbers, it would be inaccurate to call it Discoland. During filming, sales for the Village People albums started to decline and disco became increasingly unfashionable. \\"They'll still be hot,\\" said Carr of the Village People. \\"If not I will resurrect them.\\" Two of the band's three biggest hits, \\"In the Navy\\" and \\"Macho Man,\\" do not appear in the film, though Perrine wears a T-shirt emblazoned with the words \\"Macho Woman\\" as she jogs through the men's locker room at the YMCA. Another reference to one of the band's songs, \\"San Francisco (You've Got Me),\\" appears in the opening credits, as Jack passes a group of three women with the words \\"San Francisco\\" printed on their T-shirts. The band's silver and white costumes in the \\"Milkshake\\" sequence and red costumes in the finale sequences were designed by Tony- and Oscar-winning designer Theoni V. Aldredge. ===Music=== # \\"The Sound of the City\\" - David London # \\"Samantha\\" - David London # \\"I Love You to Death\\" - Village People # \\"Sophistication\\" - The Ritchie Family # \\"Give Me a Break\\" - The Ritchie Family # \\"Liberation\\" - Village People # \\"Magic Night\\" - Village People # \\"Y.M.C.A.\\" - Village People # \\"Milkshake\\" - Village People # \\"Can't Stop the Music\\" - Village People Jack's song \\"Samantha\\" is credited in the film as being sung by David London, a pseudonym for rock singer Dennis \\"Fergie\\" Frederiksen, who was the lead singer for several popular rock bands during the 1980s. London/Frederiksen also sings a second song on the soundtrack, \\"The Sound of the City\\". While the film's soundtrack album contains the 10 songs from the film, the incidental score by Morali and Belolo was released on LP only in Australia.https://www.discogs.com/Jacques-Morali-Henri-Belolo-Cant-Stop-The- Music-The-Original-Score-Album/release/12368661 One of the songs in the film's background score is the instrumental backing track of \\"Like an Eagle,\\" a hit song by another Casablanca Records artist, Dennis Parker. ==Release== By the time of the film's release during the summer of 1980, the disco genre had not only peaked in the United States but also was experiencing a backlash there. As a result, the film received scathing reviews from critics and performed poorly at the box office. At a cost estimated at $20 million, the film was a colossal failure financially, bringing in only a tenth of that in gross revenue, and is considered one of the reasons for the downfall of AFD. \\"Our timing was wrong, and in this business, timing is everything,\\" wrote Lew Grade, who invested in the movie.Lew Grade, Still Dancing: My Story, William Collins & Sons 1987 p 252 The soundtrack album was better received, and while it reached only #49 in the U.S. (the first Village People album not to go Gold), it reached #9 in the UK and #1 in Australia. The film itself also performed well in Australia, where the world premiere preview was shown at the Paramount Theatre, Sydney on June 1, 1980, with the after party held at Maxy's. The BBC bought the film for two showings for $3.5 million, which caused much controversy at the time,HESTON TO SHOOT UP FOR HOLMES: MOVIE NEWS Mann, Roderick.

Carr's next film, Grease 2, brought in more than twice as much on its opening weekend as this film grossed in its entire run. Even though it was considered a failure, Grease 2 nearly made back its investment in its U.S. gross alone. Since its initial failure, the film has gained something of a cult status as a camp film. Released on DVD in 2002, the film has been screened at gay film festivals, including the 2008 London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival, and is an annual New Year's tradition on Australian television. Baskin-Robbins Ice Cream sold a flavor called \\"Can't Stop the Nuts\\" as part of the promotion of the film. ==Critical response== Can't Stop the Music has received very negative reviews from critics. It currently holds an 7% \\"rotten\\" score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 2.41/10. The New York Times gave the film a scathing review, calling it \\"thoroughly homogenized.\\"Movie Review - Can't Stop the Music - 'CAN'T STOP THE MUSIC' - NYTimes.com Variety magazine felt likewise, writing \\"The Village People, along with ex-Olympic decathlon champion Bruce Jenner, have a long way to go in the acting stakes.\\" Nell Minow of Yahoo! Movies called the film \\"an absolute trainwreck of a movie\\", but that it had \\"some hilariously campy moments.\\" Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert selected the film as one of their \\"dogs of the year\\" in a 1980 episode of Sneak Previews. Can't Stop the Music was the first winner of the Worst Picture Golden Raspberry Award, for it was a double feature of this and Xanadu that inspired John J. B. Wilson to start the Razzies. The film is listed in Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of \\"The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made\\". ===Awards and nominations=== {  - b0c4de; text- align:center;\\" !

Now retired, he still supports R.S.C. Anderlecht, his former team. ==Career== He was nicknamed Polle Gazon (Polle is Paul in Brussels dialect, and Gazon means lawn in Dutch and French) due to the large number of fouls committed on him. In 1964, he played in the Belgium- Netherlands match alongside 10 Anderlecht players after the substitution of goalkeeper Delhasse by Jean-Marie Trappeniers. Van Himst won the Belgian championship 8 times, all of them with Anderlecht, the club for which he started playing his first professional season in 1959‚Äì60. With Anderlecht, he scored 233 goals in 457 matches (16 seasons). He then played for RWDM (another Brussels club) in 1975‚Äì76 and for Eendracht Aalst (then in the second division) in the following season. Between 1960 and 1974, Van Himst scored 30 goals (in 81 matches) for the Belgian national team. This performance made him Belgium's second top scorer‚Äîalong with Bernard Voorhoof‚Äîand the 10th most capped player for his country. He made his debut on 19 October 1960 in a match against Sweden and he was part of Belgium's team which qualified for the 1970 World Cup. Van Himst then helped Belgium reach third place at the Euro 1972. As a football manager, Van Himst has worked notably for Anderlecht and the national team which he led to the 1994 FIFA World Cup. == Awards == He holds the record of four times being awarded the Golden Shoe.

L. n. was the second son of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last King of Rome. ==History== During his father's reign, he accompanied his elder brother, Titus, and their cousin, Lucius Junius Brutus, to consult the Oracle at Delphi regarding an omen witnessed by the king. After she had interpreted the omen, the princes asked the Oracle who should succeed their father as king; her reply was that he who should first kiss his mother upon their return would succeed the king. While Titus and Arruns assumed that this meant their actual mother, Brutus correctly intuited that mother earth was intended, and so deliberately stumbled and fell upon the trio's return to Italy.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita 1:56. Following the overthrow of the monarchy in 509 BC, Titus and Arruns went with their father to Caere, while Brutus was elected one of the first consuls.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita 1:60. After the first unsuccessful attempt by the Tarquins to regain the throne in 509, Arruns commanded the Etruscan cavalry at the Battle of Silva Arsia. Having spied from afar the lictors, and thereby recognising the presence of a consul, Arruns soon saw that his cousin Brutus was in command of the Roman cavalry. The two men charged each other, and were each speared to death.

The long-form official designation is Force maritime de l'a√©ronautique navale. Born as a fusion of carrier squadrons and the naval patrol air force, the A√©ronavale was created in 1912. The force is under the command of a flag officer officially named Admiral of Naval Aviation (ALAVIA) with his headquarters at Toulon naval base. It has a strength of around 6,800 military and civilian personnel. It operates from four airbases in Metropolitan France and several detachments in foreign countries or French overseas territories. Carrier-borne pilots of the French navy do their initial training at Salon-de- Provence Air Base after which they undergo their carrier qualification with the US Navy. ==Aircraft inventory== -  Breguet Atlantique II  France  Turboprop  ASW   22   -  Dassault Falcon 10 M  France  Jet  Utility   6   -  Dassault Falcon 50 M  France  Jet  Patrol   8   -  Dassault Falcon 200 Guardian  France  Jet  Patrol   5   -  Dassault Rafale M  France  Jet  Multirole   42   -  Embraer EMB 121 Xingu  Brazil  Turboprop Utility   11   -  Eurocopter SA365 Dauphin  France  Rotorcraft  SAR   8   -  Eurocopter AS565 Panther  France  Rotorcraft  Utility   16   -  Grumman E-2C Hawkeye  USA  Turboprop  AEW&C;   3   -  Mudry CAP 10  France  Propeller  Trainer   7   -  NHIndustries NH90 Caiman Marine  France  Rotorcraft  Attack/SAR   24   - } ==Structure== Active bases of the French naval air arm (status 2013) Immediately after the end of the World War II, the Aeronavale only had Supermarine Seafire Mk.III (Flottille 1F) and Douglas SBD Dauntless dive- bombers (Flotilles 3F et 4F). ===Components=== The flight personnel of the French Navy falls into three categories: fighter aviation, fixed-wing aviation and helicopter aviation.

","title":"French Naval Aviation"},{"id":"2220713","text":"Themyscira () is a fictional unitary sovereign city-state and archipelagic island nation appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Previously known as Paradise Island and the Amazon Isles, it first appeared in All Star Comics #8 (December 1941). Themyscira is a segregated nation of women‚Äîregarded as a feminist utopia‚Äîgoverned by Aphrodite's Law, which declared that the Amazons would be immortal as long as no man set foot on their island. Subsequently, any man attempting to set foot on Themyscira, does so under penalty of death.https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main- qimg-4763e71ec804b0998e4d29162420de87.webp Themyscira is the theocracy and capital city that serves as the Amazonians' government and place of origin for Wonder Woman. The name for the entire archipelago became \\"The Paradise Islands\\", when the city was renamed \\"Themyscira\\" with the character's February 1987 relaunch in Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #1. Both the island and city are named after the mythological city of Themiscyra, the capital of the Amazons in Greek mythology. == Publication history  Pre-Crisis (1941‚Äì1987) === When Wonder Woman's homeland is first introduced in 1941, it is referred to as Paradise Island, a secret and hidden island on Earth inhabited by the Amazons of myth. The Amazons were given a break from the hostilities and temptations of Man's World, and so were decreed to start a new life improving themselves by sequestering themselves to this island away from ancient Greece, after being enslaved by Hercules. With the island blessed by the Olympian Gods, no man was allowed to physically set foot on it. When United States Army intelligence officer Steve Trevor's plane crashes there during World War II, he is nursed back to health just outside of the capital city by Princess Diana, daughter of the island's Queen Hippolyta. Diana later competes against other Amazons to become Wonder Woman, the emissary from Paradise Island who will accompany Steve back to \\"Man's World\\" and aid in the fight against the Axis powers. It was established that all Amazons are adept at a discipline called \\"bullets and bracelets\\" in which they are able to deflect bullets fired at them using the chain bands on their wrists. It was originally implied, but not yet fully confirmed, that Paradise Island was located somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. Then in the 1970s television incarnation (as portrayed by Lynda Carter), Paradise Island's location was set in the Bermuda Triangle. And the 2009 animated movie version had set it in the Aegean Sea. Originally, there were three generations of Amazons living on the island, with Princess Diana being from the second. This basic back-story remains intact throughout the Golden Age and Silver Age of Comic Books, until the 1985‚Äì1986 \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" storyline. Upon the conclusion of this limited series, most characters in the DC Comics universe underwent some revamp or retcon in their storyline history, and Wonder Woman was one of several characters whose entire continuity was rebooted. === Post-Crisis (1987‚Äìpresent) === The 1987 relaunch of the Wonder Woman series establishes that the Amazons are the reincarnated souls of women slain throughout pre-history by men. Shaped from clay over 3,000 years previous and given new lives by five Olympian goddesses ‚Äî Artemis, Athena, Demeter, Hestia, and Aphrodite ‚Äî the Amazons are granted immortality, great physical strength, highly acute senses, beauty, wisdom, and love for one another. They are tasked to teach the merits of virtue, love, and equality to the men of \\"Patriarch‚Äôs World\\".Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #1 They have founded the city-state of Themyscira in ancient Greece ‚Äì Modern day Turkey,Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #36 and 41 which is ruled by sisters Hippolyta and Antiope. Ares, the God of War and a chief opponent of the Amazons, manipulates his half brother Heracles to gather forces and attack Themyscira. Heracles subdues and ravages Hippolyta, and his forces succeed in ransacking Themyscira and making the Amazons their slaves. Hippolyta pleads with the goddesses for help. Athena agrees to aid the Amazons, but only if they do not go against their purpose of creation by seeking revenge. When they agree to her terms, Athena frees the Amazons from their chains. Once freed, however, the Amazons proceed to slaughter most of their captors. Antiope leads a force of Amazons off into Greece, seeking vengeance on Heracles. As decreed by the goddesses, Hippolyta leads the remaining Amazons to a remote island where, as penance for their failures as teachers, they become guardians of Doom's Doorway, preventing the escape of the monsters beneath. Renaming the island paradise Themyscira after their fallen capital, the Amazons began their new lives, erecting buildings and monuments and perfecting their skills as artisans and warriors. For centuries, the Amazons of Themyscira live in a perfect state of harmony with their surroundings, under a theocracy. They know no racism, although many consider Antiope's Lost Tribe of Amazons as little more than savages. They do not think in terms of male gender; the word \\"policeman\\" is alien to them until Diana's departure into the outside world. Homosexuality is completely natural to them ‚Äî while some Amazons are chaste, others have loving consorts. Their city is composed entirely of Greco-Roman architecture from 1200 BCE, and they wear Greek garb, togas, sandals, and period armor. The Amazons also all wear the Bracelets of Submission as constant reminders of their Enslavement and obedience to their patrons, although only Diana is able to deflect bullets with them. They are fervently religious, worshipping their gods as living deities. Artemis is their primary goddess, and they worship her with a sacrifice of a deer. The Amazons celebrate their creation each year in a Feast of Five, remembering the goddesses who brought them to life. Occasionally, the Nereides bring to the shores of Themyscira young infants who would have otherwise drowned in accidents. Called \\"sending forth\\", these infants are tutored spiritually in Amazonian ideals, and they are then sent back mystically to the place of their disappearance. Julia Kapatelis, Diana's first friend in Patriarch's World, is one such infant. Themyscira is presently located in the Bermuda Triangle, but possesses the magical ability to teleport to any location or time period its inhabitants desire. == National timeline  Turmoil and genocide === * Every headline writer who has written volume two of Wonder Woman has depicted Themyscirian slaughter: ** George P√©rez ‚Äì Included Heracles' rape and slaughter of the Amazons, as well as the destruction of the first Bana-Mighdall city. ** William Messner-Loebs ‚Äì Depicted an Amazon tribal war over Themyscira's ownership. ** John Byrne ‚Äì Had Darkseid invade Themyscira, kill half the population and turned the remainder to stone. ** Phil Jimenez ‚Äì Re-introduced the Amazon tribal war over Themyscira's ownership. ** Walt Simonson ‚Äì Caused a Hydra to turn the Amazons into stone. ** Greg Rucka ‚Äì Had OMACs kill over half the remaining Amazon population. ** Brian Azzarello ‚Äì Had Hera transform all the Amazons into snakes and petrify Hippolyta. * The island(s) can shift its location over both land and time.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #104 === Enter Wonder Woman === Queen Hippolyta uses the soil of Themyscira to create her daughter Diana. Art by Adam Hughes. In recent times, Hippolyta's daughter Diana, also known as Wonder Woman, has become an ambassador to the outside world. With Diana's help, the Amazons have opened the shores of Themyscira to dignitaries of \\"Patriarch‚Äôs World\\". The creatures beneath Doom's Doorway were defeated, and for a time the Amazons destroyed their battle armor as testament to a new period of peace. The Amazons opened up their shores to dignitaries from Patriarch's world, female and male, but that exchange was almost destroyed by Eris, Goddess of Discord. The Amazons even conducted their own tour of the United States, where they were framed for the murders of several people by Antiope's descendants, the mercenary assassins of Bana-Mighdall, and Circe. It was during the War of the Gods that the Amazons recrafted their armory, vowing to again become warriors. Circe would transplant many of these mercenary women of Bana- Migdhall, called the Lost Tribe, to Themyscira, where, after warring with the Amazons already there, joined forces to stop Circe herself. The two sects of Amazons forged an uneasy truce, living at opposite ends of the island. Professor Julia Kapatelis, close friend to Wonder Woman and the Amazons, was later presented with a grant by the National Geographic Society to locate the original Turkish city of Themyscira. Unfortunately Julia had to leave the excavation midway through the project once one of her daughter's friends committed suicide.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #46 Whether the original city of Themyscira has been fully excavated or not has not been shown. Later still, Darkseid‚Äôs forces ravaged Themyscira during a search to locate the Greek gods, killing nearly half of the Amazons there in the process. As they began rebuilding, the Amazons found themselves reverting to stone. This was as a result of the gods‚Äô departure from the mortal plane, and the Amazons‚Äô connection to their creator beings so diminished as to revert their bodies to their primordial state. With the gods returned to Olympus, the Amazons were again transformed into their flesh and blood state. Yet more Amazons were killed in a confrontation with the demonic entity known as Neron. With Diana and Hippolyta adventuring in Patriarch's World as Wonder Woman for longer and longer periods of time, the Banas and the Themyscirans were manipulated into a bloody civil war at the hands of Magala, who had been possessed by the spirit of Antiope's murderer, Ariadne. Using the pre-existing disdain of the tribes against each other, Magala used allies among both Amazon cities to spark the vengeful conflict. The island was left in ruins, and the war was only stopped when Hippolyta abolished the royal family, renounced her throne. Left at odds but on even political ground, the Bana Amazons and the Themyscirans joined forces against the alien forces of Imperiex. Themyscira, mystically moved into outer space, was destroyed, and hundreds of Amazons from both tribes died. When Wonder Woman led each tribe of Amazons into an ecumenical prayer, funneling power into the new god Darkseid, the warrior women helped destroy Imperiex and its ally Brainiac 13. === New Themyscira === Olympian and Bana- Mighdallian goddesses each bless Themyscira as it is rejuvenated. Art by Phil Jimenez. After the island had been destroyed by Imperiex during the \\"Our Worlds at War\\" storyline, Themyscira was rebuilt and relocated, this time to the Bermuda Triangle. Designed by the likes of Julia Kapatelis, the Martian Manhunter, Steve Trevor, Canadian architect Jean Claude Tibet, and Amazon master designer Kaleeza Fashed, the new Themyscira was built with the help of alien technology. Adding to the re-creation of the islands, Themyscira was restored by the combined might of the Greek and Egyptian goddesses the Amazons worship. Transformed into a mighty series of floating islands dedicated to the free exchange of information and ideas, the new Themyscira was governed by members of both tribes of Amazons. After some time Themyscira was nearly destroyed in a jealous fit of rage by the goddess Hera. She was angry that Zeus was magically spying on the bathing form of Artemis via scrying pool and kicked the pool itself. Because of her actions the islands ceased to float in mid-air under their own power and instead resumed being a cluster of traditional islands once more. Recently, Themyscira was under attack by OMAC forces, as described in DC Comics's Infinite Crisis. Due to this attack, as well as the many various other attacks the island has suffered through since Diana became Wonder Woman, it was decided that the Olympian and Bana- Mighdallian goddesses would transport the island and its inhabitants (sans Diana) to an undisclosed location to live in peace. === One year later === Under the direction of writer Will Pfeifer the Amazons attack Washington D.C. as retaliation for the attack on the island in a six-part mini-series titled Amazons Attack. At the end of the series the Amazons have their memories erased by Granny Goodness (posing as the goddess Athena), and are scattered throughout the world with false personas. Only Hippolyta and four of her original Royal Guard remain on Themyscira. The Queen is exiled to near-empty Themyscira (which had seemingly been sunk and restored during the battle) for her crimes of attacking Man's World, though her actions had been influenced by the evil Circe. Later, Zeus then revives the Amazons' memories and provides transport for them to return to Themyscira. == Flora and fauna  Pre- Crisis === When the Wonder Woman comic book was first introduced Paradise Island possessed creatures reminiscent of the island country Australia's kangaroos that the Amazons rode like horses called Kangas. Diana's Kanga was named Jumpa. There were also smaller, rabbit-like creatures wandering Paradise Island. === Post-Crisis === When the Wonder Woman comic book was revamped and started anew in the mid-1980s this was scrapped and the island only had common game animals such as deer, wild boar, horses, and fish. The only exotic/mythological creatures on the island were more sinister in nature and existed in Doom's Doorway to the underworld, which the Amazons swore to keep trapped and never to escape. In the waters surrounding Themyscira also lived Naiads and in the forests Dryads who played most of their days away, occasionally with the Amazons. In 1999 when writer Eric Luke took over the Wonder Woman comic book he had several lost mythical creatures from around the globe take asylum on Themyscira. These creatures consisted of: Chiron the Centaur, a white Pegasus, Ladon the Dragon, a chimera, and a Sphinx.Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #142 Then when writer Phil Jimenez wrote the title in the early 2000s he had several dinosaurs from the land of Skartaris also take refuge on Themyscira, in addition to the reappearance of Kangas on the island. To date no Kangas have been seen as riding animals. Writer Greg Rucka reintroduced a second Pegasus to serve as Wonder Woman's riding companion, this one black with red eyes. It is assumed he still lives on Themyscira. In 2003, a flashback story by Matt Wagner called Batman/Superman/Wonder Woman: Trinity has the island defended by sapient giant birds. They perish in the defense of the Amazons. The 2007 storyline \\"Amazons Attack!\\" depicted the Amazons as having creatures such as giant Stygen wasps and some domesticated winged horses, large amounts of saddled chimeras, and three titan sized ogres. Then in 2007/2008 the \\"Countdown to Final Crisis\\" storyline introduced the then new revelation that the island is protected by a school of Megalodons. When writer Gail Simone took over the title she showed that Hippolyta cared for griffins in the royal stables. She also introduced the island of Thalarion, the home of Gargareans during the \\"Rise of the Olympian\\" storyline. The Gargareans possessed herds of winged horses similar to Themyscira but also possessed flocks of winged lions as well. Their leader Achilles also has a domesticated battle elephant named Mysia who has two trunks, two mouths, three glowing eyes, an impenetrable hide, and the ability to walk on air. As the Gargareans incorporated themselves among the Amazons of Themyscira it is safe to assume these creatures also reside there. == Notable citizens In other media== Themyscira as shown in the 2010 film Superman/Batman: Apocalypse. ===Film=== * In the television movie Wonder Woman (1974) starring actress Cathy Lee Crosby, the island of the Amazons is shown briefly but not named. * Themyscira is shown in the animated film Justice League: The New Frontier (2008), in which Wonder Woman spars with a fellow Amazon on a beach. * Themyscira is shown in the animated film Wonder Woman (2009). * Themyscira and its Amazons are shown prominently in the animated film Superman/Batman: Apocalypse (2010). * While not appearing in the animated film Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox (2013), it was stated that the Amazons had invaded the United Kingdom and renamed it New Themyscira. * In Justice League: War (2014), Diana mentions that she came from Paradise Island (the former name of Themyscira in the comics). * Themyscira is shown in Wonder Woman (2017). It was portrayed in keeping with the post-Crisis version. Steve Trevor crash-lands on Themyscira after stealing a German aircraft from a base somewhere in Turkey, which implies a location somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean. Themiscyra is once again shown in Justice League where Steppenwolf (played in motion capture by Ciaran Hinds) lands through a Boom Tube in a vault that is storing one of the three Mother Boxes which contain the power of New Gods. After Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) escapes while the amazons fight him off, Steppenwolf successfully retrieves the box after a brief fight with the Queen and injuring several other Amazonians. Before leaving, he foreshadows that Hippolyta will obey him and love him after he gains the power of the three boxes, as well as other Amazonians. * Themyscira is shown in the animated film Wonder Woman: Bloodlines (2019). ===Television=== * In line with comic book continuity of the time, the 1975‚Äì1979 Lynda Carter television series Wonder Woman did feature Themyscira but it was still called \\"Paradise Island\\" instead as Wonder Woman's home in several episodes.

Ponta do Sol's main harbour, although small, was a crucial commercial gateway to the western part of the island. These importation and exportation businesses fostered the creation of new activities in what became the central part of the community and created a flow of goods into the hinterland (such as local and imported goods). Today, commercial activity is scattered throughout the municipality, while the port area of Ponta do Sol has declined in importance. In its place, the economy of the municipality has been dispersed to other parishes, particularly Canhas, which were essentially agricultural parishes, but have developed into important economic nodes, while still retaining its rural landscape. While agriculture remains the primary activity in the interior, and the fisheries industry has declined significantly, construction and industrial enterprises have conquered a prominent role in the municipality. The service industry, particularly tourism, has carved-out a portion of the income stream, with high-quality hotels or residential inns located in the countryside and urban centres. ==References * *Photos of Ponta do Sol Category:Madeira Island Category:Municipalities of Madeira Category:Populated places established in the 1420s Category:Towns in Portugal ","title":"Ponta do Sol, Madeira"},{"id":"2220722","text":"Amos Lee (born Ryan Anthony Massaro, June 20, 1977) is an American singer- songwriter whose musical style encompasses folk, rock, and soul.

S. saprophyticus is a common cause of community-acquired urinary tract infections. ==History== S. saprophyticus was not recognized as a cause of urinary tract infections until the early 1970s, more than 10 years after its original demonstration in urine specimens. Prior to this, the presence of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) in urine specimens was dismissed as contamination. ==Epidemiology and pathogenesis== In humans, S. saprophyticus is found in the normal flora of the female genital tract and perineum. It has been isolated from other sources, too, including meat and cheese products, vegetables, the environment, and human and animal gastrointestinal tracts. S. saprophyticus causes 10‚Äì20% of urinary tract infections (UTIs). In females 17‚Äì27 years old, it is the second-most common cause of community-acquired UTIs, after Escherichia coli. Sexual activity increases the risk of S. saprophyticus UTIs because bacteria are displaced from the normal flora of the vagina and perineum into the urethra. Most cases occur within 24 hours of sex, earning this infection the nickname \\"honeymoon cystitis\\". S. saprophyticus has the capacity to selectively adhere to human urothelium. The adhesin for S. saprophyticus is a lactosamine structure. S. saprophyticus produces no exotoxins. ==Clinical features== Patients with urinary tract infections caused by S. saprophyticus usually present with symptomatic cystitis. Symptoms include a burning sensation when passing urine, the urge to urinate more often than usual, a 'dripping effect' after urination, weak bladder, a bloated feeling with sharp razor pains in the lower abdomen around the bladder and ovary areas, and razor-like pains during sexual intercourse. Flank pain may occur due to infection of the upper urinary tract, such as pyelonephritis. Signs and symptoms of renal involvement are also often registered. ==Laboratory diagnosis== The urine sediment of a patient with a S. saprophyticus urinary tract infection has a characteristic appearance under the microscope manifesting leukocytes, erythrocytes, and clumping due to cocci adhering to cellular elements. Chemical screening methods for bacteriuria, such as, urine nitrate and glucose do not always detect S. saprophyticus infection. This is because unlike Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae urinary tract infections, S. saprophyticus does not reduce nitrate and has a longer generation time, thus does not consume glucose as rapidly. Even when such an infection occurs above the neck of the bladder, low numbers of colony-forming units (less than 105 cfu/ml) are often present. S. saprophyticus is identified as belonging to the genus Staphylococcus using the Gram stain and catalase test. It is identitified as a species of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) using the coagulase test. Lastly, S. saprophyticus is differentiated from S. epidermidis, another species of pathogenic CoNS, by testing for susceptibility to the antibiotic novobiocin. S. saprophyticus is novobiocin- resistant, whereas S. epidermidis is novobiocin-sensitive. ==Treatment== S. saprophyticus urinary tract infections are usually treated with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole or with a quinolone such as to be alone norfloxacin. It has also been shown to be susceptible to ampicillin & ceftriaxone. The many home remedies or natural treatments for urinary tract infections are not clinically proven, such as cranberry juice, alkalinization, and many types of common herbs and spices. Some show promise, such as to affect the formation of biofilms on surfaces or medical equipment, and in other in vitro situations. ==Different subspecies== Two subspecies of S. saprophyticus exist: S. s. bovis and S. s. saprophyticus, the latter has colony diameter of > 5mm, and more commonly found in human UTIs. S. s. saprophyticus is nitrate-reductase negative and pyrrolidonyl-arylamidase negative, while S. saprophyticus bovis has colony diameter of < 5mm, nitrate-reductase positive and pyrolidonyl- arylamidase positive. ==References *Type strain of Staphylococcus saprophyticus at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase saprophyticus Category:Gram-positive bacteria Category:Bacteria described in 1940 ","title":"Staphylococcus saprophyticus"},{"id":"2220738","text":"Demi-culverin cast circa 1587 The demi-culverin was a medium cannon similar to but slightly larger than a saker and smaller than a regular culverin developed in the late 16th century.Artillery through the ages Barrels of demi-culverins were typically about long, had a calibre of and could weigh up to .

It included the city transit lines in Rochester, Syracuse, Utica, Oneida and Rome, plus various interurban lines connecting those cities. New York State Railways also held a 50% interest in the Schenectady Railway Company, but it remained a separate independent operation. The New York Central took control of the Rochester Railway Company, the Rochester and Eastern Rapid Railway and the Rochester and Sodus Bay Railway in 1905, and the Mohawk Valley Company was formed by the railroad to manage these new acquisitions. New York State Railways was formed in 1909 when the properties controlled by the Mohawk Valley Company were merged. In 1912 it added the Rochester and Suburban Railway, the Syracuse Rapid Transit Railway, the Oneida Railway, and the Utica and Mohawk Valley Railway. The New York Central Railroad was interested in acquiring these lines in an effort to control the competition and to gain control of the lucrative electric utility companies that were behind many of these streetcar and interurban railways. Ridership across the system dropped through the 1920s as operating costs continued to rise, coupled with competition from better highways and private automobile use. New York Central sold New York State Railways in 1928 to a consortium led by investor E. L. Phillips, who was looking to gain control of the upstate utilities. Phillips sold his stake to Associated Gas & Electric in 1929, and the new owners allowed the railway bonds to default. New York State Railways entered receivership on December 30, 1929. The company emerged from receivership in 1934, and local operations were sold off to new private operators between 1938 and 1948. ==Early History (1905-1928)== New York State Railways stock certificate engraving The New York Central Railroad took notice to the potential competition arising from the streetcar and electric interurban railways being built in its territory across upstate New York. In an effort to control the competition, the railroad began buying controlling interests in the Rochester Railway Company, the Rochester and Sodus Bay Railway, and the Rochester and Eastern Rapid Railway. The Mohawk Valley Company was formed in 1905 to manage these properties. The company also controlled the Canandaigua Gas Light Company, the Despatch Heat, Light and Power Company, and the Eastern Monroe Electric Light and Power Company. New York State Railways was incorporated on March 22, 1909, to take over the three railways and consolidate them into a single entity. A second wave of expansion followed when the Utica and Mohawk Valley Railway, the Oneida Railway, the Syracuse Rapid Transit Railway, and the Rochester and Suburban Railway were merged into New York State Railways on October 31, 1912. The East Side Traction Company was added on August 28, 1919. At its peak, New York State Railways operated 338 miles across Rochester, Syracuse, Utica, Oneida, Sodus Bay, Canandaigua, and Geneva. In June 1920, the total value of the New York State Railway Corporation franchise in Syracuse as determined by the New York State Tax Commission was $2,320,000 down from $2,407,000 in 1919. Logo used by New York State Railways displayed on the flanks of trolleys and other equipment. Patronage on the streetcar and interurban lines declined in the 1920s, thanks to autos, buses, and paved roads ‚Äî but the electric utilities owned by the company grew. As a result, in 1928 the New York Central sold its control of the New York State Railways system to what became the Associated Gas & Electric Co. ==Decline, Receivership and Reorganization (1929-1948)== Shortly after the transaction, the stock market crashed, and on December 30, 1929, the company was put into receivership. Increased competition from private automobile ownership and the construction of better highways forced the closure of the electric interurban railways. An application was made to abandon the Rochester and Eastern Rapid Railway in November 1929, but the court process was delayed until the following summer when an order was approved to end all service to Geneva on July 31, 1930. New York State Railways emerged from receivership in 1934, and gradually the remaining core city lines were sold as separate operations. The Rochester Lines were reorganized as the Rochester Transit Corporation on August 2, 1938. The Syracuse Transit Corporation took over the former Syracuse Lines on November 22, 1939. The last streetcars operated on the Utica Lines on May 12, 1941, but it wasn't until May 1, 1948 that the transit system was reorganized as the Utica Transit Corporation. ===Rochester Lines=== The Rochester Lines were made up of the city and suburban lines operated by Rochester Railway Company, the Canandaigua local service (the former Canandaigua Street Railroad), the Rochester and Eastern Rapid Railway, and the Rochester and Sodus Bay Railway that were consolidated into New York State Railways in 1909. In 1927, the city-owned Rochester Subway was placed under the operation of New York State Railways on a contract basis with the city of Rochester. Trackless trolleys were briefly operated in Rochester between 1923 and 1932. The first streetcar lines were closed in 1929, including the Exchange, Plymouth, Emerson, and Driving Park routes. Service on the Rochester and Sodus Bay interurban to Sodus Bay was also abandoned the same year, local service to Glen Haven ended in 1933. The Rochester and Eastern Rapid Railway shut down its interurban line to Geneva in 1930, the same day local service ended in Canandaigua. The largest streetcar line conversion came in August 1936, when eleven routes (Durand-Eastman Park, Allen, Jefferson, South Clinton, Webster, Clifford, Central Park, Goodman North, Sea Breeze, Hudson, and Joseph) were closed. The following year the Park, West, and University lines were closed. The Rochester Lines were reorganized as Rochester Transit Corporation on August 2, 1938, to operate the remaining bus and streetcar transit lines. Streetcar operation ended in 1941, and the Rochester Subway shut down in 1956. All transit franchises succeeded by Rochester Transit Corporation in 1938 were later transferred to Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority in 1969. ===Syracuse Lines=== New York State Railways - A cool ride in June 1923 The Syracuse Lines consisted mainly of the city and suburban operations serving Syracuse. Several smaller streetcar and interurban lines serving the city and suburbs of Syracuse were consolidated into the Syracuse Rapid Transit Railway on May 21, 1896. Additional lines were acquired and extended throughout the 1890s. The Syracuse Rapid Transit Railway was merged with New York State Railways in 1912. At its peak, the Syracuse Lines operated more than 200 cars on 100 miles of track over 27 routes. The first streetcar line closure was the Green Street route in September 1927, with no replacement bus service. On May 31, 1930, the Valley via Elmwood and Valley via Salina routes were closed and not replaced with buses. The Burnet line was converted to bus operation On January 22, 1933. The West Genesee and West Solvay lines were closed on June 30, 1933. Additional closures followed on October 31 when the Dudley, Oak, and Park lines were shut down. The Liverpool line succumbed on the last day of 1933. The Oakwood and Summit lines were closed on May 27, 1935, and the Solvay line was the only closure in 1936. The Elmwood, East Syracuse, and Midler lines were shut down on September 15, 1937, with the Minoa route following on October 11. The Court and Midland lines closed on July 31, 1938. The final route closure under New York State Railways would be the University Line on September 30, 1939. The former Syracuse Lines were reorganized as the privately owned Syracuse Transit Corporation on November 22, 1939. All remaining streetcar lines were converted to bus by 1941. In 1972, all transit franchises were succeeded by the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority. ===Oneida Lines=== The Oneida Lines consisted of the city streetcar lines, the Oneida Railway interurban line between Syracuse and Utica (known as the \\"Third Rail Line\\"), and the Sherrill-Kenwood shuttle. The earliest portion of the Oneida Lines was incorporated in 1885 as the Oneida Railway Company of Oneida, New York (later simplified to Onedia Railway Company in 1903). Opened on July 4, 1885, as a horsecar transit operation, the line stretched 1.5 miles along Main Street from the New York Central Railroad station to the West Shore Railroad station at Oneida Castle. The horsecar operation ended on July 30, 1902, and the railway was shut down while the system was electrified and expanded. When it reopened on December 14, the operation was now 4.4 miles and included an extension to Wampsville. In 1905, the Onedia Railway leased a section of the West Shore Railroad from the New York Central Railroad for the purpose of electrifying the line for interurban service between Syracuse and Utica. A connection with the Utica street railways was made at Genesee Street, and with the Syracuse street railways near Burnet Avenue. Service began on June 16, 1907. Cars were powered by a third rail, except when running on the street railways of Syracuse, Oneida, or Utica, where the overhead trolley wire was used instead. A 1.5 mile spur was constructed from the Onedia Railway station at Sherrill to Kenwood in 1909, and operated as a single-car shuttle meeting all interurban trains. In 1911, an extension of the city streetcar was built to serve the New York, Ontario and Western Railway station at Oneida. In 1912, the Oneida operations were acquired by New York State Railways. Declining ridership through the 1920s forced the Sherrill-Kenwood shuttle to suspend operations on August 29, 1927. The shuttle was formally abandoned nearly a year later on July 31, 1928. Ridership on the Onedia Railway declined through the 1920s and the company entered receivership. The last day of service was December 31, 1930. The electrification was removed and control of the line reverted to the West Shore Railroad. Local service on the Oneida street railway ended the same day. There was no immediate successor to the transit franchises of the Onedia Lines once all streetcar and interurban railway operations ceased at the end of 1930. The Central New York Regional Transportation Authority is now responsible for bus transportation in the region formerly served by the Oneida Lines. ===Utica Lines=== The Utica Lines of New York State Railways was composed mainly of the city and suburban lines serving both Utica and Rome. The various streetcar lines serving Utica were consolidated into the Utica and Mohawk Valley Railway in 1901. The Mohawk Valley Line was an interurban connecting Rome, Utica, and Little Falls, constructed between 1902 and 1903. This became the busiest route, with half- hourly service on its double-track main line. The Rome City Street Railroad was merged into the Uitca and Mohawk Valley Railway in 1907. The U&MV; was merged into New York State Railways in 1912. The first lines to be closed were the Auburn Avenue and Oneida Street routes in 1925. That same year an amusement park was built near the main carban and shops called Forest Park, which was an immediate success, yet first to feel the effects of the Great Depression, which forced it to close in 1929. The South Woods shuttle also ended service in 1929. The Mohawk Valley Line began to show significant losses starting in 1926, and shut down on June 30, 1933. The steel interurban cars that served on the Mohawk Valley Line were purchased new in 1916, and were the newest equipment on the entire New York State Railways system. The cars were transferred to Rochester Lines in 1936 to upgrade the Rochester Subway, and entered service in 1938 under new operator Rochester Transit Corporation. The Rome city lines were never successful, and the first service suspensions came to the James Street line in 1927 and the Madison Street line in 1928. All streetcar service came in Rome to an end on December 7, 1930. In 1931, the North Utica line was closed, and the Eagle Street (6) line followed in 1932. The Lenox (15), Lincoln (10), and Blandina (9) routes closed in 1933, with South Street and Mohawk street following the year after. In 1934 the South Street and Mohawk Street lines were closed, the same year New York State Railways emerged from receivership. The James Street and Clinton lines were shut down in 1936, while the Whitesboro (11) and New York Mills (12) lines were closed in the summer of 1938. The Capron (5) line hung on until April 8, 1941. The last day for streetcar operation in Utica was May 12, 1941, when the New Hartford and Forest Park (16) lines closed. The mayor of Utica was at the controls of Car 310, the last car to roll into the Forest Park carbarn. The transit franchises formerly operated by the streetcars were continued by the Copper City Bus Line and the Rome City Bus Line. It wasn't until 1948 that many parts of the former Utica Lines were reorganized as the Utica Transit Corporation. The city-owned Utica Transit Commission took over operations in 1965, which was succeeded by the Utica Transit Authority in 1974. In 2005, the transit operations transferred to the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority and its subsidiaries Centro Rome and Centro Utica. ==References== * Category:Defunct New York (state) railroads Category:Interurban railways in New York (state) Category:Streetcars in New York (state) Category:Companies affiliated with the New York Central Railroad Category:Transportation in Rochester, New York Category:Transportation in Syracuse, New York ","title":"New York State Railways"},{"id":"2220757","text":"The Fusiliers Marins and Commandos Marine units are under command of the Force maritime des fusiliers marins et commandos (FORFUSCO) in Lorient.

An individual interacts with the external world as well as responds to internal forces. Many psychoanalysts use a theoretical construct called the ego to explain how that is done through various ego functions. Adherents of ego psychology focus on the ego's normal and pathological development, its management of libidinal and aggressive impulses, and its adaptation to reality.John Hunter Padel, 'Freudianism: Later Developments', in Richard Gregory ed., The Oxford Companion to the Mind (Oxford 1987) p. 270-1 == History Early conceptions of the ego=== Sigmund Freud initially considered the ego to be a sense organ for perception of both external and internal stimuli. He thought of the ego as synonymous with consciousness and contrasted it with the repressed unconscious. In 1910, Freud emphasized the attention to detail when referencing psychoanalytical matters, while predicting his theory to become essential in regards to everyday tasks with the Swiss psychoanalyst, Oscar Pfister. By 1911, he referenced ego instincts for the first time in Formulations on the Two Principles of Mental Functioning and contrasted them with sexual instincts: ego instincts responded to the reality principle while sexual instincts obeyed the pleasure principle. He also introduced attention and memory as ego functions. ===Freud's ego psychology=== Freud later argued that not all unconscious phenomena can be attributed to the id, and that the ego has unconscious aspects as well. This posed a significant problem for his topographic theory, which he resolved in The Ego and the Id (1923).Janet Malcolm, Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession (1988) p. 29-36 In what came to be called the structural theory, the ego was now a formal component of a three-way system that also included the id and superego. The ego was still organized around conscious perceptual capacities, yet it now had unconscious features responsible for repression and other defensive operations. Freud's ego at this stage was relatively passive and weak; he described it as the helpless rider on the id's horse, more or less obliged to go where the id wished to go.W W. Meissner, Freud and Psychoanalysis (nd) p. 159 In Inhibitions, Symptoms, and Anxiety (1926), Freud revised his theory of anxiety as well as delineated a more robust ego. Freud argued that instinctual drives (id), moral and value judgments (superego), and requirements of external reality all make demands upon an individual. The ego mediates among conflicting pressures and creates the best compromise. Instead of being passive and reactive to the id, the ego was now a formidable counterweight to it, responsible for regulating id impulses, as well as integrating an individual's functioning into a coherent whole. The modifications made by Freud in Inhibitions, Symptoms, and Anxiety formed the basis of a psychoanalytic psychology interested in the nature and functions of the ego. This marked the transition of psychoanalysis from being primarily an id psychology, focused on the vicissitudes of the libidinal and aggressive drives as the determinants of both normal and psychopathological functioning, to a period in which the ego was accorded equal importance and was regarded as the prime shaper and modulator of behavior. ===Systematization=== Following Sigmund Freud, the psychoanalysts most responsible for the development of ego psychology, and its systematization as a formal school of psychoanalytic thought, were Anna Freud, Heinz Hartmann, and David Rapaport. Other important contributors included Ernst Kris, Rudolph Loewenstein, Ren√© Spitz, Margaret Mahler, Edith Jacobson, Paul Federn, and Erik Erikson. Anna Freud Anna Freud focused her attention on the ego's unconscious, defensive operations and introduced many important theoretical and clinical considerations. In The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense (1936), Anna Freud argued the ego was predisposed to supervise, regulate, and oppose the id through a variety of defenses. She described the defenses available to the ego, linked them to the stages of psychosexual development during which they originated, and identified various psychopathological compromise formations in which they were prominent. Clinically, Anna Freud emphasized that the psychoanalyst's attention should always be on the defensive functions of the ego, which could be observed in the manifest presentation of the patient's associations. The analyst needed to be attuned to the moment-by-moment process of what the patient talked about in order to identify, label, and explore defenses as they appeared. For Anna Freud, direct interpretation of repressed content was less important than understanding the ego's methods by which it kept things out of consciousness.Malcolm, p. 36 Her work provided a bridge between Freud's structural theory and ego psychology.O. L. Zangwill, 'Freud, Anna' in Gregory ed., p. 268 Heinz Hartmann Heinz Hartmann (1939/1958) believed the ego included innate capacities that facilitated an individual's ability to adapt to his or her environment. These included perception, attention, memory, concentration, motor coordination, and language. Under normal conditions, what Hartmann called an average expectable environment, these capacities developed into ego functions and had autonomy from the libidinal and aggressive drives; that is, they were not products of frustration and conflict, as Freud (1911) believed. Hartmann recognized, however, that conflicts were part of the human condition and certain ego functions may become conflicted by aggressive and libidinal impulses, as witnessed by conversion disorders (e.g., glove paralysis), speech impediments, eating disorders, and attention-deficit disorder. Through Hartmann's focus on ego functions, and how an individual adapts to his or her environment, he worked to create both a general psychology and a clinical instrument with which an analyst could evaluate an individual's functioning and formulate appropriate therapeutic interventions. Based on Hartmann's propositions, the task of the ego psychologist was to neutralize conflicted impulses and expand the conflict-free spheres of ego functions. By doing so, Hartmann believed psychoanalysis facilitated an individual's adaptation to his or her environment. Hartmann claimed, however, that his aim was to understand the mutual regulation of the ego and environment rather than to promote adjustment of the ego to the environment. Furthermore, an individual with a less-conflicted ego would be better able to actively respond to and shape, rather than passively react to, his or her environment. Mitchell and Black (1995) wrote: \\"Hartmann powerfully affected the course of psychoanalysis, opening up a crucial investigation of the key processes and vicissitudes of normal development. Hartmann's contributions broadened the scope of psychoanalytic concerns, from psychopathology to general human development, from an isolated, self-contained treatment method to a sweeping intellectual discipline among other disciplines\\" (p. 35). David Rapaport David Rapaport played a prominent role in the development of ego psychology and his work likely represented its apex. In Rapaport's influential monograph The Structure of Psychoanalytic Theory (1960), he organized ego psychology into an integrated, systematic, and hierarchical theory capable of generating empirically testable hypotheses. According to Rapaport, psychoanalytic theory‚Äîas expressed through the principles of ego psychology‚Äîwas a biologically based general psychology that could explain the entire range of human behavior. For Rapaport, this endeavor was fully consistent with Freud's attempts to do the same (e.g., Freud's studies of dreams, jokes, and the \\"psychopathology of everyday life\\".) Other contributors While Hartmann was the principal architect ego psychology, he collaborated closely with Ernst Kris and Rudolph Loewenstein.Malcolm, p. 4 Subsequent psychoanalysts interested in ego psychology emphasized the importance of early-childhood experiences and socio- cultural influences on ego development. Ren√© Spitz (1965), Margaret Mahler (1968), Edith Jacobson (1964), and Erik Erikson studied infant and child behavior and their observations were integrated into ego psychology. Their observational and empirical research described and explained early attachment issues, successful and faulty ego development, and psychological development through interpersonal interactions. Spitz identified the importance of mother- infant nonverbal emotional reciprocity; Mahler refined the traditional psychosexual developmental phases by adding the separation-individuation process; and Jacobson emphasized how libidinal and aggressive impulses unfolded within the context of early relationships and environmental factors. Finally, Erik Erikson provided a bold reformulation of Freud's biologic, epigenetic psychosexual theory through his explorations of socio-cultural influences on ego development.Erik H. Erikson, Childhood and Society (Penguin 1973), p. 13 and p. 58-9 For Erikson, an individual was pushed by his or her own biological urges and pulled by socio-cultural forces. ===Decline=== In the United States, ego psychology was the predominant psychoanalytic approach from the 1940s through the 1960s. Initially, this was due to the influx of European psychoanalysts, including prominent ego psychologists like Hartmann, Kris, and Loewenstein, during and after World War II. These European analysts settled throughout the United States and trained the next generation of American psychoanalysts. By the 1970s, several challenges to the philosophical, theoretical, and clinical tenets of ego psychology emerged. The most prominent of which were: a \\"rebellion\\" led by Rapaport's prot√©g√©s (George Klein, Robert Holt, Roy Schafer, and Merton Gill); object relations theory; and self psychology. == Contemporary Modern conflict theory=== Charles Brenner (1982) attempted to revive ego psychology with a concise and incisive articulation of the fundamental focus of psychoanalysis: intrapsychic conflict and the resulting compromise formations. Over time, Brenner (2002) tried to develop a more clinically based theory, what came to be called ‚Äúmodern conflict theory.‚Äù He distanced himself from the formal components of the structural theory and its metapsychological assumptions, and focused entirely on compromise formations. == Ego functions == * Reality testing: The ego's capacity to distinguish what is occurring in one's own mind from what is occurring in the external world. It is perhaps the single most important ego function because negotiating with the outside world requires accurately perceiving and understanding stimuli. Reality testing is often subject to temporary, mild distortion or deterioration under stressful conditions. Such impairment can result in temporary delusions and hallucination and is generally selective, clustering along specific, psychodynamic lines. Chronic deficiencies suggest either psychotic or organic interference. * Impulse control: The ability to manage aggressive and/or libidinal wishes without immediate discharge through behavior or symptoms. Problems with impulse control are common; for example: road rage; sexual promiscuity; excessive drug and alcohol use; and binge eating. * Affect regulation: The ability to modulate feelings without being overwhelmed. * Judgment: The capacity to act responsibly. This process includes identifying possible courses of action, anticipating and evaluating likely consequences, and making decisions as to what is appropriate in certain circumstances. * Object relations: The capacity for mutually satisfying relationship. The individual can perceive himself and others as whole objects with three dimensional qualities. * Thought processes: The ability to have logical, coherent, and abstract thoughts. In stressful situations, thought processes can become disorganized. The presence of chronic or severe problems in conceptual thinking is frequently associated with schizophrenia and manic episodes. * Defensive functioning: A defense is an unconscious attempt to protect the individual from some powerful, identity- threatening feeling. Initial defenses develop in infancy and involve the boundary between the self and the outer world; they are considered primitive defenses and include projection, denial, and splitting. As the child grows up, more sophisticated defenses that deal with internal boundaries such as those between ego and super ego or the id develop; these defenses include repression, regression, displacement, and reaction formation. All adults have, and use, primitive defenses, but most people also have more mature ways of coping with reality and anxiety. * Synthesis: The synthetic function is the ego's capacity to organize and unify other functions within the personality. It enables the individual to think, feel, and act in a coherent manner. It includes the capacity to integrate potentially contradictory experiences, ideas, and feelings; for example, a child loves his or her mother yet also has angry feelings toward her at times. The ability to synthesize these feelings is a pivotal developmental achievement. Reality testing involves the individual's capacity to understand and accept both physical and social reality as it is consensually defined within a given culture or cultural subgroup. In large measure, the function hinges on the individual's capacity to distinguish between her own wishes or fears (internal reality) and events that occur in the real world (external reality). The ability to make distinctions that are consensually validated determines the ego's capacity to distinguish and mediate between personal expectations, on the one hand, and social expectations or laws of nature on the other. Individuals vary considerably in how they manage this function. When the function is seriously compromised, individuals may withdraw from contact with reality for extended periods of time. This degree of withdrawal is most frequently seen in psychotic conditions. Most times, however, the function is mildly or moderately compromised for a limited period of time, with far less drastic consequences' (Berzoff, 2011). Judgment involves the capacity to reach ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù conclusions about what is and what is not ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù behavior. Typically, arriving at a ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù conclusion involves the following steps: (1) correlating wishes, feeling states, and memories about prior life experiences with current circumstances; (2) evaluating current circumstances in the context of social expectations and laws of nature (e.g., it is not possible to transport oneself instantly out of an embarrassing situation, no matter how much one wishes to do so); and (3) drawing realistic conclusions about the likely consequences of different possible courses of action. As the definition suggests, judgment is closely related to reality testing, and the two functions are usually evaluated in tandem (Berzoff, 2011). Modulating and controlling impulses is based on the capacity to hold sexual and aggressive feelings in check with out acting on them until the ego has evaluated whether they meet the individual's own moral standards and are acceptable in terms of social norms. Adequate functioning in this area depends on the individual's capacity to tolerate frustration, to delay gratification, and to tolerate anxiety without immediately acting to ameliorate it. Impulse control also depends on the ability to exercise appropriate judgment in situations where the individual is strongly motivated to seek relief from psychological tension and/or to pursue some pleasurable activity (sex, power, fame, money, etc.). Problems in modulation may involve either too little or too much control over impulses (Berzoff, 2011). Modulation of affect The ego performs this function by preventing painful or unacceptable emotional reactions from entering conscious awareness, or by managing the expression of such feelings in ways that do not disrupt either emotional equilibrium or social relationships. To adequately perform this function, the ego constantly monitors the source, intensity, and direction of feeling states, as well as the people toward whom feelings will be directed. Monitoring determines whether such states will be acknowledged or expressed and, if so, in what form. The basic principle to remember in evaluating how well the ego manages this function is that affect modulation may be problematic because of too much or too little expression. As an integral part of the monitoring process, the ego evaluates the type of expression that is most congruent with established social norms. For example, in white American culture it is assumed that individuals will contain themselves and maintain a high level of personal/vocational functioning except in extremely traumatic situations such as death of a family member, very serious illness or terrible accident. This standard is not necessarily the norm in other cultures (Berzhoff, Flanagan, & Hertz, 2011). Object relations involves the ability to form and maintain coherent representations of others and of the self. The concept refers not only to the people one interacts with in the external world but also to significant others who are remembered and represented within the mind. Adequate functioning implies the ability to maintain a basically positive view of the other, even when one feels disappointed, frustrated, or angered by the other's behavior. Disturbances in object relations may manifest themselves through an inability to fall in love, emotional coldness, lack of interest in or withdrawal from interactions with others, intense dependency, and/or an excessive need to control relationships (Berzhoff, Flanagan, & Hertz, 2011). Self-esteem regulation involves the capacity to maintain a steady and reasonable level of positive self-regard in the face of distressing or frustrating external events. Painful affective states, including anxiety, depression, shame, and guilt, as well as exhilarating emotions such as triumph, glee, and ecstasy may also undermine self-esteem. Generally speaking, in dominant American culture a measured expression of both pain and pleasure is expressed; excess in either direction is a cause for concern. White Western culture tends to assume that individuals will maintain a consistent and steadily level of self-esteem, regardless of external events or internally generated feeling states (Berzhoff, Flanagan, & Hertz, 2011). Mastery when conceptualized as an ego function, mastery reflects the epigenetic view that individuals achieve more advanced levels of ego organization by mastering successive developmental challenges. Each stage of psychosexual development (oral, anal, phallic, genital) presents a particular challenge that must be adequately addressed before the individual can move on to the next higher stage. By mastering stage-specific challenges, the ego gains strength in relations to the other structures of the mind and thereby becomes more effective in organizing and synthesizing mental processes. Freud expressed this principle in his statement, ‚ÄúWhere id was, shall ego be.‚Äù An undeveloped capacity for mastery can be seen, for example, in infants who have not been adequately nourished, stimulated, and protected during the first year of life, in the oral stage of development. When they enter the anal stage, such infants are not well prepared to learn socially acceptable behavior or to control the pleasure they derive from defecating at will. As a result, some of them will experience delays in achieving bowel control and will have difficulty in controlling temper tantrums, while others will sink into a passive, joyless compliance with parental demands that compromises their ability to explore, learn, and become physically competent. Conversely, infants who have been well gratified and adequately stimulated during the oral stage enter the anal stage feeling relatively secure and confident. For the most part, they cooperate in curbing their anal desires, and are eager to win parental approval for doing so. In addition, they are physically active, free to learn and eager to explore. As they gain confidence in their increasingly autonomous physical and mental abilities, they also learn to follow the rules their parents establish and, in doing so, with parental approval. As they master the specific tasks related to the anal stage, they are well prepared to move on to the next stage of development and the next set of challenges. When adults have problems with mastery, they usually enact them in derivative or symbolic ways (Berzhoff, Flanagan, & Hertz, 2011). == Conflict, defense and resistance analysis == According to Freud's structural theory, an individual's libidinal and aggressive impulses are continuously in conflict with his or her own conscience as well as with the limits imposed by reality. In certain circumstances, these conflicts may lead to neurotic symptoms. Thus, the goal of psychoanalytic treatment is to establish a balance between bodily needs, psychological wants, one's own conscience, and social constraints. Ego psychologists argue that the conflict is best addressed by the psychological agency that has the closest relationship to consciousness, unconsciousness, and reality: the ego. The clinical technique most commonly associated with ego psychology is defense analysis. Through clarifying, confronting, and interpreting the typical defense mechanisms a patient uses, ego psychologists hope to help the patient gain control over these mechanisms.Padel, p. 270-1 == Cultural influences == * The classical scholar E.

Dodds used ego psychology as the framework for his influential study The Greeks and the Irrational (1951).Padel, p. 271 * The Sterbas relied on Hartmann's conflict-free sphere to help explain the contradictions they found in Beethoven's character in Beethoven and His Nephew (1954).M. Solomon, Beethoven Essays (1988) p. 149 == Criticisms == Many authors have criticized Hartmann's conception of a conflict-free sphere of ego functioning as both incoherent and inconsistent with Freud's vision of psychoanalysis as a science of mental conflict. Freud believed that the ego itself takes shape as a result of the conflict between the id and the external world. The ego, therefore, is inherently a conflicting formation in the mind. To state, as Hartmann did, that the ego contains a conflict-free sphere may not be consistent with key propositions of Freud's structural theory. Ego psychology, and 'Anna-Freudianism', were together seen by Kleinians as maintaining a conformist, adaptative version of psychoanalysis inconsistent with Freud's own views.√âlisabeth Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan (2005) p. 193 Hartmann claimed, however, that his aim was to understand the mutual regulation of the ego and environment rather than to promote adjustment of the ego to the environment. Furthermore, an individual with a less-conflicted ego would be better able to actively respond and shape, rather than passively react to, his or her environment. Jacques Lacan was if anything still more opposed to ego psychology, using his concept of the Imaginary to stress the role of identifications in building up the ego in the first place.David Macey, 'Introduction'. Jacques Lacan The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis (Penguin 1994) p. xxi-ii Lacan saw in the \\"non-conflictual sphere...a down-at- heel mirage that had already been rejected as untenable by the most academic psychology of introspection'.Jacques Lacan, √âcrits (1997) p. 231 == See also  References  Further reading == *Brenner, C.

He studied at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich,https://archive.org/stream/newinternational01gilm#page/139/mode/1up entered the Royal Artillery in 1836, was promoted to captain in 1846, and served throughout the Crimean War as brigade-major and assistant adjutant- general of artillery (awarded CB, brevets of major and lieutenant-colonel). In the Indian rebellion of 1857 he served on the staff in a similar capacity. Promoted brevet-colonel in 1860, he was specially employed in 1863 in the Northwest frontier of the India campaign, and was Deputy-Adjutant-General, Bengal, from 1863 to 1866, when he returned home. From 1870 to 1875 Adye was Director of Artillery and Stores at the War Office. He was made a KCB in 1873, and was promoted to be major-general and appointed governor of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1875, and Surveyor-General of the Ordnance in 1880. In 1882 he was chief of staff and second in command of the expedition to Egypt, and served throughout the campaign (awarded GCB and thanks of Parliament). He was Governor of Gibraltar from 1883 to 1886 where he was noted for his artwork (see below) and in keeping a good balance between the needs of Gibraltar being a military fortress and of the needs of the civilian population to make a living. The military got rooms for recreation and the civilians enjoyed relaxed trade laws.E. M. Lloyd, 'Adye, Sir John Miller (1819‚Äì1900)', rev.

At some time in his career he became good friends with both William Armstrong and Stuart Rendel, so much so that his daughter, Winifreda, married the former's grand-nephew and heir, William Henry Watson-Armstrong in 1889. His other daughter, Evelyn Violet, was to become John Meade Falkner's wife on 18 October 1899. His son, Sir John Adye, would become a major-general. His son, John Adye married Clara Joan Williams in 1899.

Founded in 1925 and run for many years by brothers E.J. and Jack Stephani, Nickey Chevrolet became one of the largest factory dealerships, specializing in high performance muscle car sales and service. Nickey Chevrolet's Service Department performed numerous hot rod conversions, and their parts department functioned as a huge speed shop. Nickey Chevrolet was originally established in the 1920s at 4120 Irving Park Road (at the corner of Kedvale and Irving Park Road). When the Kennedy expressway was built in the 1950s, Nickey Chevrolet moved to 4501 W. Irving Park Road in Chicago. Ultimately, Nickey Chevrolet grew to a huge facility. Nickey Chevrolet began its high performance parts business in 1957. Their \\"Purple People Eater\\" Corvettes became well-known, as did their logo with a backwards \\"K\\". Nickey Chevrolet became General Motors' largest volume selling dealership for both vehicles and parts, many of the high-performance variety. The service department specialized in engine swaps, transplanting 427 cubic inch displacement (CID) \\"Big Block\\" Chevy engines into the very first 1967 Camaros,Arvid Svensen, \\"The Last Nickey Camaro\\", Hot Rod, February 21, 2014. and soon there after into Novas, Chevelles, Impalas and even Corvettes. Nickey Chevrolet modified hundreds of cars to their customers‚Äô specifications. A customer could walk into the dealership, pick out a car, and then have it modified to their taste. Most of these domestic modified cars are maintained in museums or private collections and are rarely seen in public. The dealership was sold in 1973, and became Keystone Chevrolet. The key players who built Nickey's performance cars and image moved to a new location on Milwaukee Avenue in Chicago. The New Speed Shop and Automobile Conversion Center was named \\"Nickey Chicago\\". They continued to build legendary Hi- Performance Chevys until 1977 when the speed/performance shop finally closed its doors. In 2002 a muscle car collector and enthusiast, Stefano Bimbi, purchased the legal rights and trademarks for the Nickey brand. The new company, Nickey Performance, located in Saint Charles, Illinois, builds, sells and services vehicles branded as Nickey Super Cars, and has also taken steps to establish a registry for Nickey-modified cars.Jim Mueller, \\"Provenance puzzle lacks only backward K: Owner of souped-up 1970s Nova traces its roots to learn whether it's the rarest Nickey machine\\", Chicago Tribune, April 29, 2007. ==References== Category:Auto dealerships of the United States Category:Automotive motorsports and performance companies Category:American companies established in 1925 Category:Retail companies established in 1925 Category:Retail companies disestablished in 1973 Category:Muscle cars Category:Chevrolet Category:Defunct companies based in Chicago ","title":"Nickey Chevrolet"},{"id":"2220779","text":"The demi-cannon was a medium-sized cannon, similar to but slightly larger than a culverin and smaller than a regular 42 lb (19 kg) cannon, developed in the early seventeenth century.Artillery through the ages A full cannon fired a 42-pound shot, but these were discontinued in the eighteenth century as they were seen as too unwieldy.

Wildey was born and raised in Yonkers, New York, adjacent to New York City. He did World War II military service at Naval Air Station Barbers Point in Hawaii, where he began his art career as a cartoonist for the base newspaper.Quatto, p. 2 He recalled his professional start as freelancing for the magazine and comic book company Street & Smith in 1947.Walker, Mort, ed.

He also contributed to the publishers Master Comics, Story Comics, Cross Publications and possibly others, puckishly observing that he'd worked for every publisher except EC, \\"the good one\\".Weeks, John, \\"Wildey Rides Again\\", Rio at Bay (Dark Horse Comics, July 1992) In 1952, Wildey moved his family ‚Äî wife Ellen and daughter Debbie ‚Äî to Tucson, Arizona. Two years later, he began a regular stint at Atlas Comics, the 1950s forerunner of Marvel Comics, where he drew dozens of Western stories through 1957, primarily four- and five-page tales in such titles as Frontier Western. His art also appeared in the Atlas horror-fantasy comics Journey into Unknown Worlds, Marvel Tales, Mystery Tales, Mystic, Strange Tales, Uncanny Tales, and others. Historian Ken Quattro describes Wildey's most \\"noteworthy\\" Western as the 19-issue Atlas series Outlaw Kid, \\"his take on the classic Western antihero\\", in which Wildey illustrated three to four stories per issue: Much of this work was reprinted by Marvel from 1970 through 1974, exposing his work to a later generation. After an Atlas Comics retrenchment in 1957 ‚Äî during which the company mixed a trove of inventory stories by Wildey and many others with new material for two to three years ‚Äî Wildey freelanced on a small number of standalone anthology stories for two other publishers: Harvey Comics, in the science fiction/fantasy titles Alarming Tales #3-5 (Jan.-Sept. 1958), and Black Cat Mystic #62 (March 1958), Hi-School Romance #73 (March 1958) and Warfront #34 (Sept. 1958); and DC Comics, in Tales of the Unexpected #33 & 35 (Nov. 1958, March 1959), House of Secrets #17 (Feb.1959), My Greatest Adventure #28 & 32 (Nov. 1958 & June 1959), and House of Mystery #89 (Aug. 1959).

(sources vary) he took over the art for writer Leslie Charteris' long-running New York Herald Tribune Syndicate comic strip The Saint. Some of their strips were inked by Dick Ayers as the deadlines of producing a daily and Sunday strip proved daunting. The strip ended in 1962. Adding credence to the latter date is Wildey spending part of 1960, possibly only a month, penciling his idol Milton Caniff's famed Steve Canyon comic stripQuatto, p. 3 and trying unsuccessfully to launch his own syndicated strip. Two such proposed strips would help provide a character name and some narrative background to Wildey's later animated television series, Jonny Quest. As he described in 1986, === Television animation === Following the end of The Saint comic strip in 1962, Wildey found, through an ad in the National Cartoonists Society newsletter, what was initially a one-week television animation job in Los Angeles, California, working under artist Alex Toth on Cambria Productions' 1962 animated series Space Angel.Herman, Daniel. Silver Age: The Second Generation of Comic Artists (Hermes Press, Neshannock Township, Pennsylvania, 2004) p. 195. Trade paperback Wildey eventually worked on the series for \\"about 12 or 14 weeks\\", after which, he recalled in 1986, Wildey wrote and drew a presentation, using such magazines as Popular Science, Popular Mechanics, and Science Digest \\"to project what would be happening 10 years hence\\", and devising or fancifully updating such devices as a \\"snowskimmer\\" and hydrofoils. When Hanna-Barbera could not obtain the rights to Jack Armstrong, the studio had Wildey rework the concept. Wildey \\"went home and wrote Jonny Quest that night ‚Äî which was not that tough.\\" For inspiration he drew on Jackie Cooper and Frankie Darro movies, Milton Caniff's comic strip Terry and the Pirates, and, at the behest of Hanna-Barbera, the James Bond movie Dr. No. Hanna-Barbera refused to give him a \\"created by\\" credit, Wildey said in 1986, and he and studio \\"finally arrived on 'Based on an idea created by', and that was my credit.\\" The prime-time TV animated series Jonny Quest debuted on ABC on September 18, 1964. As comics historian Daniel Herman wrote, Wildey did not design the more cartoonishly-drawn comic relief pet dog, Bandit, which was designed by animator Richard Bickenbach. Wildey went on to work on animated series including The Herculoids, Jana of the Jungle, Return to the Planet of the Apes (1975), Godzilla (1978 TV series) (1978), Mister T (1983), and Chuck Norris: Karate Kommandos (1986). === Return to comics === In the mid-1960s, Wildey returned to comic books, drawing stories for the premiere issues of Harvey Comics' Thrill-O-Rama, Unearthly Spectaculars (both Oct. 1965 series) and Double-Dare Adventures (Dec. 1965). Most significantly during this time, he collaborated with writer Gaylord DuBois on Gold Key Comics' licensed series Tarzan when that long-running comic, which had been reprinting stories drawn by Russ Manning, began producing new work beginning with issue #179 (Sept. 1968). The duo's work appeared through issue #187 (Sept. 1969). After a hiatus from comic books, broken only by three 1971 stories for Skywald Publications' black-and-white horror-comics magazines Psycho and Nightmare, plus the Haunted Tank story \\"The Armored Ark\\" in DC Comics' G.I. Combat #153 (May 1972), Wildey created the comic strip Ambler, which ran from 1972 to 1975.Who's Who of American Comic Strip Producers: W at The Comic Strip Project. WebCitation archive. Syndicated to newspapers by the Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate, the contemporary strip chronicled the adventures of an itinerant folk musician. Afterward, Wildey returned to comic books to do stories for Archie Comics' horror-humor anthology series Mad House, Gold Key's Mystery Comics Digest, and DC's Our Army at War and Sgt. Rock, among other titles. Returning to his Western roots, he drew the feature \\"Jonah Hex\\" in DC's Weird Western Tales #26 (Feb. 1975) and co-created with writer Larry Lieber the feature \\"Kid Cody, Gunfighter\\" in Atlas/Seaboard Comics' Western Action #1 (Feb. 1975). As both writer and artist, Wildey created his own Western feature, \\"Rio\\", that ran in Eclipse Comics' Eclipse Monthly #1-10 (Aug. 1983 ‚Äî July 1984), and he returned to his most prominent creation that decade with a Jonny Quest comic-book series published by Comico. Wildey wrote and drew the stories in Jonny Quest #1 (July 1986) and Jonny Quest Classics #1-3 (May‚ÄìJuly 1987), and provided several covers. Comico also reprinted several of his Rio stories in a June 1987 one-shot, and Wildey produced new Rio stories for Dark Horse Comics' two-issue miniseries Rio at Bay (July-Aug. 1992). His last original comics work was the painted art for the eight-page Western tale \\"The End of the Time of Leinard\\" by writers Faye Perozich and Harlan Ellison in Dark Horse's Harlan Ellison's Dream Corridor Special (Jan. 1995). === Death === Wildey died of heart failure in Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 5, 1994.Quatto, p. 5 == Bibliography == In 1971, Jim Vadeboncoeur, Jr. published a Wildey portfolio, The Movie Cowboy, consisting of 26 illustrations sized 12x18 inches.

The Aston Manor Local Board of Health was formed in 1869, from part of the ancient parish of Aston. It became an urban sanitary district in 1875, and then under the Local Government Act 1894 became an urban district with a directly elected council. Aston Manor covered the area today known as Aston, including Aston Park, along with Lozells. It was immediately to the north of the county borough of Birmingham. There were extensive manufacturing facilities, including those of motors and cycles with their accessories, also paper-mills, breweries, etc. The population then was largely industrial. The district contained the now publicly owned Aston Hall. Aston Manor was granted a charter of incorporation to become a municipal borough in 1903. The census of 1911 recorded a population of around 75,000 in the borough, enough for it to become a county borough in its own right.VoB - Aston Manor It instead was added to the county borough of Birmingham that year.Youngs, Volume 2 ==Notable people== * Victor Johnson (1883‚Äì1951) was a track cycling racer who, in 1908, won a gold medal at the Olympics.

The Fusiliers Marins are also in charge of providing protection for naval vessels and key French Navy sites on land. == Missions == The Fusiliers Marins are tasked with: * participating in land operations from the sea; * participating in special operations (Commandos Marine); * the protection of sensitive sites of the Navy (Naval bases, French Naval Aviation, transmission stations etc.); * reinforcement of protection duties provided by Naval forces (maintaining order on board ship and the protection of naval vessels against attack). The Fusiliers Marins should not be confused with the Troupes de Marine of the modern French Army. The latter corps has undergone several changes in role from marine infantry to colonial troops (Troupes coloniales) to overseas forces. It has however remained as an essentially land force while the Fusiliers Marins have throughout their history been an integral part of the French Navy. == History of the French Fusiliers Marins == Soldier of the Compagnies Franches de la Marine during the 18th century === Ancestors, Compagnies Franches de la Marine === In 1627, Cardinal Richelieu undertook the creation of a Naval Regiment, intended to provide soldiers for service on naval ships. Their roles were to include combat on both land or sea, under the orders of the officers of the ship. These sea-going soldiers formed part of the ship's company and helped with its sailing. The basic units were the Compagnies Franches de la Marine: separate detachments of about 70 men, each commanded by a royal lieutenant des vaisseaux, supported by two ensigns. The marine companies served in the French colonies of the period and particularly in Nouvelle-France. These formations existed under differing titles until 1825, when they were dissolved by a royal ordinance decreeing that landing parties (compagnies de d√©barquement) be made up of sailors. The R√©giments de la Marine were subsequently succeeded by the Troupes de la marine, which later became the colonial troops (Troupes Coloniales) of the French Army, specifically raised for overseas service. === Creation of a specialized corps in 1856 === These companies lacked specialized personnel trained for combat on land. An Imperial decree dated 5 June 1856, created the Fusiliers Marins, whose formation and training were undertaken by a battalion stationed at Lorient, Brittany. This specialized corps was put under the command of the captains and sergeants-at-arms of the various naval vessels of the French fleet, and was the direct ancestor of the modern Fusiliers Marins. Since that date, the Fusiliers Marins have participated the following conflicts: * The military colonial campaigns of the end of the 19th century, * The expeditions in China, Cochinchina, Tonkin and Madagascar, * The European conflicts in 1870, 1914-1918 and 1939-1945. During the Franco- Prussian War of 1870, following the disaster of Sedan, several brigades of Fusiliers Marins and naval artillerymen were engaged in combat at Bapaume and subsequently participated in the defense of Paris, notably at the Bourget and at L'Ha√ø-les-Roses. This force formed part of the Government Arm√©e versaillaise () employed in the suppression of the Paris Commune in 1871. Nord department, in November 1914 A detachment of fusiliers marins defended the French Legation (diplomatic mission) in Peking during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. Amongst their officers was enseigne de vaisseau Paul Henry and Pierre Alexis Ronarc'h, who, in 1914, would serve as Counter-Admiral and Commandant of the Brigade de Fusiliers Marins BFM attached to the 32nd Army Corps. The Brigade de Fusiliers Marins distinguished themselves at Dixmude, on the Yser, at Longewaede, Hailles and Laffaux during the early stages of World War I. Three French ships have been named after Dixmude. The Fusiliers Marins participated in the campaigns of Free France. They initially formed a battalion then the 1er R√©giment de Fusiliers Marins 1e RFM at the corps of the 1st Free French Division (1er DFL) and the 1er Bataillon de Fusiliers Marins Commandos (1er BFMC) who served in 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando. The 177 Commandos Kieffer who disembarked on 6 June in Normandy, were Fusiliers Marins forming part of the Free France Forces. Other Fusiliers Marins, drawn from the former Arm√©e de Vichy, formed the R√©giment Blind√© de Fusiliers-Marins (RBFM) which served efficiently as part of the 2nd Armored Division. On 30 April 1945 the Fusiliers Marins played a role in the liberation of the √éle d'Ol√©ron. Disembarked at 0620 at Gatseau, an FM detachment advanced slowly through forested terrain facing a stern resistance. The regimental colors of the 1st Regiment of Fusiliers Marins at the 2008 Bastille Day Military Parade In 1945, the Far Eastern Marine Brigade (BMEO) was created with the RBFM and the 1er RFM. Based on the request of general Leclerc, the Marine Brigade formed river brigades in 1945-1946. They became the Dinassaut, which operated in Tonkin and Cochinchina from 1947 to 1954. In 1956, with operational cadres serving in Algeria; the Demi-Brigade of Fusiliers Marins (DBFM) was created to play a leading role in securing the borders between Algeria and Morocco until 1962. This demi-brigade was under the command of Vessel Commander (CV) Ponchardier. The French Fusiliers Marins are a specialised marine corps of the French Navy, similar to (for example) the Royal Marines of the Royal Navy, the Spanish Navy Marines (Spanish Navy), the San Marco Marine Brigade (Italian Navy), and the United States Marine Corps of the United States Navy.

Along with the Naval Commandos, they are unique among French forces in wearing the beret this way. When wearing regular dress uniforms, the sailor cap is used by junior ratings and the peaked cap by senior petty officers and officers.

This family includes two genera, Malapterurus and Paradoxoglanis, with 21 species. Several species of this family have the ability to produce an electric shock of up to 350 volts using electroplaques of an electric organ. Electric catfish are found in tropical Africa and the Nile River. Electric catfish are usually nocturnal and carnivorous. Some species feed primarily on other fish, incapacitating their prey with electric discharges, but others are generalist bottom foragers, feeding on things like invertebrates, fish eggs, and detritus. The largest can grow to about long, but most species are far smaller. ==Description== The Malapteruridae are the only group of catfish with well-developed electrogenic organs; however, electroreceptive systems are widespread in catfishes. The electrogenic organ is derived from anterior body musculature and lines the body cavity. Electric catfish do not have dorsal fins or fin spines. They have three pairs of barbels (the nasal pair is absent). The swim bladder has elongate posterior chambers, two chambers in Malapterurus and three in Paradoxoglanis. Malapterurus have been conditioned by means of reward to discharge on signal. As reported in the New York Times, April 2, 1967, a researcher, Dr. Frank J. Mandriota of City College, New York, conditioned an M. electricus to discharge on a light signal for a reward of live worms delivered automatically. This is the first conditioning that modified neither glandular nor muscular responses. The largest can grow to about SL and . Most Malapterurus and all Paradoxoglanis species are much smaller, reaching less than long. ==Relationship to humans== The electric catfish of the Nile was well known to the ancient Egyptians. The Egyptians reputedly used the electric shock from them when treating arthritis pain. They would use only smaller fish, as a large fish may generate an electric shock from 300 to 400 volts. The Egyptians depicted the fish in their mural paintings and elsewhere; the first known depiction of an electric catfish is on a slate palette of the predynastic Egyptian ruler Narmer about 3100 BC. It was suitably called \\"angry catfish\\" in ancient Egyptian. An account of its electric properties was given by an Arab physician of the 12th century; then as now, the fish was known by the suggestive name of , which means \\"thunder\\" (literally \\"trembler\\" or \\"shaker\\"). The shock of these catfish is used to stun prey and in defense. It is not known to be fatal to humans, but large electric catfish can stun an adult person. In small electric catfish the generated current is far less and only feels like a tingle to humans. ==References== Category:Fish of Africa Category:Strongly electric fish Category:Taxa named by Pieter Bleeker ","title":"Electric catfish"},{"id":"2220793","text":"Monuments for military animals in Ottawa, Ontario. Military animals are trained animals that are used in warfare and other combat related activities. As working animals, different military animals serve different functions. Horses, elephants, camels, and other animals have been used for both transportation and mounted attack. Pigeons were used for communication and photographic espionage. Many other animals have been reportedly used in various specialized military functions, including rats and pigs. Dogs have long been employed in a wide variety of military purposes, more recently focusing on guarding and bomb detection, and along with dolphins and sea lions are in active use today. A U.S. Navy dog handler at the War Dog Memorial in the National War Dog Cemetery at Naval Base Guam. The cemetery honors the dogs --mostly Doberman Pinschers--that were killed in service with the United States Marine Corps during the Second Battle of Guam in 1944. == Use  For transportation and hauling === Circus elephants clear bomb damage, Hamburg, Germany, November 1945. Northern Alliance forces in the Battle of Mazar-i-Sharif.Independent Online, US, Taliban both claim success in offensives, November 8, 2001 * The horse was the most widely used animal throughout the recorded history of warfare. Early mounts could pull a chariot or carry lightly armored skirmishing forces. With the appearance of heavier mounts and the invention of the stirrup, the horse-mounted cavalry became the most prestigious combat arm in Europe for several centuries. A knight's warhorse was trained to bite and kick. The combination of the horse-mounted warrior armed with a bow made the steppe people's armies the most powerful military force in Asian history. With the appearance of modern ranged weapons and motor vehicles, horse use for military purposes fell into decline. However, horses and mules are still used extensively by various armies today for transport in difficult terrain. * While elephants are not considered domesticable, they can be trained to serve as mounts, or for moving heavy loads. Sanskrit hymns record their use for military purposes as early as 1,100 B.C. A group of elephants was employed by Hannibal during the Second Punic War. They were employed as recently as World War II by both the Japanese and Allies. Elephants could perform the work of machines in locations where vehicles could not penetrate, so they found use in the Burma Campaign. * Camels have typically seen use as mounts in arid regions (Camel cavalry). They are better able to traverse sandy deserts than horses, and require far less water. Camels were employed in both world wars. Camels are used by the Indian Army and Border Security Force for patrolling in the desert regions of Rajasthan. * Mules were used by the U.S. Army, the British Army, and the Indian Army during World War II to carry supplies and equipment over difficult terrain. Pack animals that are innately patient, cautious, and hardy, mules could carry heavy loads of supplies where Jeeps and even pack horses could not travel. Mules were used in North Africa, Burma, and in Italy. They are also used for transporting supplies in mountainous regions. * Oxen have been used widely in war as beasts of burden, especially to transport heavy or siege artillery through heavy terrain. *Both Sweden and, later, the Soviet Union, attempted to utilize moose as deep-snow cavalry. Moose were discovered to be unsuitable for warfare, as they easily contracted livestock diseases, were difficult to feed, and fled the battleground. The Soviets later trained moose not to be gun-shy, but were unable to make use of their cavalry because of the Soviet-Finnish War and World War II. ===As weapons=== As fighters or mounts A dog employed by the Sanitary Corps during World War I to locate wounded soldiers. It is fitted with a gas mask. * Dogs were used by the ancient Greeks for war purposes, and they were undoubtedly used much earlier in history. The Roman Empire, starting with Marcus Aurelius, also used dogs in combat. The Romans trained the Molossian dog (or Canis Molossus) specifically for battle, often coating them in protective spiked metal collars and mail armor, and arranging them into attack formations.War Culture Animals of War During their conquest of Latin America, Spanish conquistadors used Alaunts to kill warriors in the Caribbean, Mexico and Peru. Mastiffs, as well as Great Danes, were used in England during the Middle Ages, where their large size was used to scare horses to throw off their riders or to pounce on knights on horseback, disabling them until their master delivered the final blow. * Ramses II had a pet lion which fought with him during the Battle of Kadesh. * Pliny the Elder wrote about the use of war pigs against elephants. As he relates it, elephants became scared by the squeal of a pig and would panic, bringing disaster to any soldiers who stood in their path of flight.Pliny, (VIII, 1.27)Aelian, de Natura Animalium book XVI, ch. 36 D√ºrer's Rhinoceros, a fanciful 'armoured' depiction. * It is unsubstantiated that rhinoceros were used for war functions. By analyzing Albrecht D√ºrer's famous 1515 woodcut, it is possible that the liberties taken with the rhino's design were in fact designs for a suit of armour created for the rhinoceros's fight in Portugal.Suggested by Glynis Ridley (2004), Clara's Grand Tour: Travels with a Rhinoceros in Eighteenth-century Europe, Atlantic Monthly Press, , a study of Clara the rhinoceros; however, there is no mention of this in Bedini. However, rhinos' apparently 'thick' or 'plated' skin is actually very sensitive and the animals have poor eyesight, heavily limiting their ability to run in a specific direction. Their overly aggressive nature would make them unsuitable for use in mounted combat. * War elephants were widely used in most parts of South Asia and North Africa, and were also employed by the Diadochi kingdoms and the Roman Empire. As living bombs * According to Pr. Shi Bo, in \\"Trente-six Stratag√®mes Chinois\\" (in French, ), monkeys were used in the beginning of the Southern Song Dynasty, in a battle between rebels of the Yanzhou (Yasuo) province and the Chinese Imperial Army, led by Zhao Yu. The monkeys were used as live incendiary devices. The animals were clothed with straw, dipped in oil and set on fire. They were set loose into the enemy's camp, thereby setting the tents on fire, and driving the whole camp into chaos. * In 1267, the sheriff of Essex was accused of plotting to release flying cockerels carrying bombs over London.Jones, Dan. The Plantagenets: The Kings Who Made England (William Collins, 2012). * Anti-tank dogs ‚Äì a Soviet, World War II weapon that had mixed success. Canines with explosives strapped to their backs were used as anti-tank weapons. * Project Pigeon ‚Äì a proposed U.S. World War II weapon that used pigeons to guide bombs. * Bat bomb, a U.S. project that used Mexican free-tailed bats to carry small incendiary bombs. * Animal-borne bombs have been used by modern terrorists and insurgents in the Middle East, who have affixed explosives to animals, sometimes left wandering alone, and other times ridden by suicide bombers, in modern insurgent attacks in the Middle East. * Historical accounts of incendiary pigs were recorded by the military writer PolyaenusPolyaenus, \\"Stratagems\\" 4.6.3 and by Aelian.Aelian, \\"On Animals\\" 16.36 Both writers reported that Antigonus II Gonatas' siege of Megara in 266 BC was broken when the Megarians doused some pigs with combustible pitch, crude oil or resin, set them alight, and drove them towards the enemy's massed war elephants. The elephants bolted in terror from the flaming, squealing pigs, often killing great numbers of their own soldiers by trampling them to death. To conceal explosive devices * Exploding rat ‚Äì dead rats were prepared for use by the British Special Operations Executive in World War II against Germany. Rat carcasses were filled with plastic explosives, to be left in locations such as factories where, it was hoped, the stoker tending a boiler would likely dispose of the unpleasant discovery by shoveling it into the furnace, causing it to explode.British Special Operations Executive (SOE): Tools and Gadgets Gallery. BBC. Retrieved June 7, 2005. The rats contained only a small amount of explosive; however, a puncture of a high-pressure boiler could trigger a devastating boiler explosion. * Animal carcasses have been used to camouflage roadside improvised explosive devices during the Iraqi insurgency. ===In communications=== General Slocum to General Sherman announcing the surrender of Atlanta, Georgia in the American Civil War Homing pigeons have seen use since medieval times for carrying messages. They were still employed for a similar purpose during World War I and World War II. In World War II, experiments were also performed in the use of the pigeon for guiding missiles, known as Project Pigeon. The pigeon was placed inside so that they could see out through a window. They were trained to peck at controls to the left or right, depending on the location of a target shape. Some dogs also saw use as messengers. ===For morale=== There is a long-standing tradition of military mascots ‚Äì animals associated with military units that act as emblems, pets or take part in ceremonies. ===For espionage=== In the years before the First World War pigeon photography was introduced to military intelligence gathering. Although employed during major battles like at Verdun and Somme, the method was not particularly successful. Various attempts in this direction were made during the Second World War as well. A CIA pigeon camera dating from the 1970s is displayed in the CIA Museum; details of CIA missions using this camera are still classified. The Acoustic Kitty was a CIA project to use surgically modified cats to spy on the Kremlin and Soviet embassies in the 1960s. Despite expenditure of around $10 million, the project failed to produce practical results and was cancelled in 1967. Documents about the project were declassified in 2001. In 2006, The Independent ran a story that the \\"Pentagon develops brain implants to turn sharks into military spies\\". In 2007 Iranian authorities captured 14 squirrels, which were allegedly carrying spying equipment. The story was widely dismissed in the West as \\"nuts\\". A number of spying scares in the Middle East involved birds. According to Israeli ornithologist Yossi Leshem, Sudanese authorities detained an Egyptian vulture in the late 1970s, and a white pelican in the early 1980s, both carrying Israeli equipment used for animal migration tracking. A more mediatized event was the 2011 capture by a Saudi farmer of a griffon vulture, which was eventually released by the Saudi authorities after they determined that the Israeli equipment it carried was used for scientific purposes. This was followed by international mockery and criticism of the Arab media outlets which uncritically had reported on the bird's alleged role in espionage.Vulture Saudis Nabbed Was Third Israeli Bird Held Since 1975 , Science News In 2012, a dead European bee-eater tagged with an Israeli leg band was found by villagers near the south-eastern Turkish city of Gaziantep. The villagers worried that the bird may have carried a micro-chip from Israeli intelligence to spy on the area. Turkish authorities examined the corpse of the bee-eater and assured villagers that it is common to equip migratory birds with rings in order to track their movements.Turkey villagers see Israeli spy in migratory bird BBC, May 16, 2012. === For locating hazards === Dogs have been used for detecting mines; they were trained to spot trip wires, as well as mines and other booby traps. They were also employed for sentry duty, and to spot snipers or hidden enemy forces. On land, giant pouched rats such as the Gambian giant pouched rat have been tested with considerable success as specialised mine detecting animals, as their keen sense of smell helps in the identification of explosives and their small size prevents them from triggering land mines.Giant rats sniff out Mozambique's mines. IOL (29 January 2009). Chickens were used during the Gulf Wars to detect poisonous gases in an operation called Kuwaiti Field Chicken (KFC); the designation of the US Marines for chickens used in this role was Poultry Chemical Confirmation Devices. The plan was put on hold after 41 of 43 chicken used for such purposes died within a week of arrival in Kuwait. Beginning during the Cold War, research has been done into the uses of many species of marine mammals for military purposes. The U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program uses military dolphins and sea lions for underwater sentry duty, mine clearance, and object recovery. ===Other specialized functions=== Pictured with a reel of communication wire, Sergeant Reckless was a highly decorated US Marine Corps artillery horse in the Korean War. Cats were used in the Royal Navy to control vermin on board ships. Able seacat Simon of HMS Amethyst received the Dickin Medal. During the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939), Nationalist pilots attached fragile supplies to live turkeys, which descended flapping their wings, thus serving as parachutes which could also be eaten by the defenders of the monastery of Santa Maria de la Cabeza.Antony Beevor, \\"The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936‚Äì1939\\", (Penguin Books, 1982.) Furthermore, use of military chickens was proposed in the British Blue Peacock project. The scheme involved burying nuclear bombs in the ground for later detonation should occupied (West) Germany be overrun by Warsaw Pact forces. The primitive electronic devices of the 1950s were unreliable in frozen ground, and the chickens were considered as a source of biogenic heat.

Yevtushenkov worked as an engineer at Karacharovo Plastics Works until 1982, and as chief engineer and first deputy general director of the Polymerbyt Scientific and Production Association until 1987, when he was appointed as the head of the Department of Science and Technology for the Moscow city government. Yevtushenkov resigned in 1993 to establish Sistema. ==Career== Since 1995 he is the major shareholder and chairman of the board of the Russian investment holding company Sistema (together with another Top Managers such as Evgeny Novitsky). Sistema was an early shareholder in Russian mobile telecommunications pioneer VimpelCom, and sold its stake when the company was the first Russian company to list on the New York Stock Exchange in November 1996. Yevtushenkov took Sistema public in February 2005, in a $1.35 billion IPO that was Russia's largest ever at the time.

It was traditionally taken to be , but was in fact a measure of value and tax assessment, including obligations for food-rent ('), maintenance and repair of bridges and fortifications, manpower for the army ('), and (eventually) the ' land tax. The hide's method of calculation is now obscure: different properties with the same hidage could vary greatly in extent even in the same county. Following the Norman Conquest of England, the hidage assessments were recorded in the Domesday Book and there was a tendency for land producing ¬£1 of income per year to be assessed at 1 hide. The Norman kings continued to use the unit for their tax assessments until the end of the 12th century. The hide was divided into 4 yardlands or virgates. It was hence nominally equivalent in area to a carucate, a unit used in the Danelaw. ==Original meaning== The Anglo-Saxon word for a hide was hid (or its synonym hiwisc). Both words are believed to be derived from the same root hiwan, which meant \\"family\\". Bede in his Ecclesiastical History (c. 731) describes the extent of a territory by the number of families which it supported, as (for instance), in Latin, terra x familiarum meaning 'a territory of ten families'. In the Anglo-Saxon version of the same work hid or hiwan is used in place of terra ... familiarum. Other documents of the period show the same equivalence and it is clear that the word hide originally signified land sufficient for the support of a peasant and his householdLennard pp.58-60 or of a 'family', which may have had an extended meaning. It is uncertain whether it meant the immediate family or a more extensive group.Faith (1997) pp.132-7 Charles-Edwards suggests that in its early usage it referred to the land of one family, worked by one plough and that ownership of a hide conferred the status of a freeman,Charles-Edwards p.5 to whom Stenton referred as \\"the independent master of a peasant household\\".Stenton p.278 ==Holy Roman usage== Hides of land formed the basis for tax levies used to equip free warriors (miles) of the Holy Roman Empire. In 807 it was specified that in the region west of the Seine, for example, a vassal who held four or five hides was responsible for showing up to a muster in person, fully equipped for war. Three men who each possessed one hide, though, merely were grouped such that two of them were responsible for equipping the third, who would go to war in their name. Those holding half- hides were responsible for readying one man for every group of six. This came about as a way of ensuring that the liege took to the field with a fully equipped and provisioned force.Delbr√ºck, 18 ==In Anglo-Saxon England== In early Anglo-Saxon England, the hide was used as the basis for assessing the amount of food rent (known as feorm) due from a village or estate and it became the unit on which all public obligations were assessed, including in particular the maintenance and repair of bridges and fortifications and the provision of troops for manning the defences of a town or for the defence force known as the 'fyrd'. For instance, at one period, five hides were expected to provide one fully armed soldier in the king's service, and one man from every hide was to be liable to do garrison duty for the burhs and to help in their initial construction and upkeep.Powicke. Military Obligation in Medieval England. pp.18-21 A land tax known as geld was first levied in 990 and this became known as the Danegeld, as it was used to buy off the Danes who were then raiding and invading the country. It was raised again for the same purpose on several occasions. The already existing system of assessment of land in hides was utilised to raise the geld, which was levied at a stated rate per hide (e.g. two shillings per hide). Subsequently the same system was used for general taxation and the geld was raised as required.E. Lipson, The Economic History of England, 12th ed., vol. 1 p. 16 The hide was a measure of value rather than a measurement of area,Faith (1997) p.91 but the logic of its assessment is not easy to understand, especially as assessments were changed from time to time and not always consistently. By the end of the Anglo-Saxon period it was a measure of 'the taxable worth of an area of land', but it had no fixed relationship to its area, the number of ploughteams working on it, or its population; nor was it limited to the arable land on an estate. According to Bailey, \\"It is a commonplace that the hide in 1086 had a very variable extent on the ground; the old concept of 120 acres cannot be sustained.\\"Bailey, p. 5 Many details of the development of the system during the 350 years which elapsed between the time of Bede and the Domesday Book remain obscure. According to Sir Frank Stenton, \\"Despite the work of many great scholars the hide of early English texts remains a term of elusive meaning.\\"Stenton, p. 279 The fact that assessments consistently tended to be made in units of 5 hides or multiples of 5 hides goes to show that we are not speaking of fixed or even approximate acreages and this applies not only to the 11th century but to charters of the 7th and 8th centuries.Stenton p.287 Nevertheless, the hide became the basis of an artificial system of assessment of land for purposes of taxation, which lasted for a long period. The most consistent aspect of the hide is described as follows by Dr Sally Harvey (referring particularly to Domesday Book): \\"Both Maitland and Vinogradoff long ago noticed that there was a general tendency throughout Domesday for a hide of land to be worth ¬£1, or, put another way, for land producing ¬£1 of income to be assessed at one hide.\\"Harvey (1987) pp.252-2 A number of early documents referring to hides have survived, but these can only be seen as steps in the development of the concept of the hide and do not enable us to see the full story. The document known as the Tribal Hidage is a very early list thought to date possibly from the 7th century, but known only from a later and unreliable manuscript. It is a list of tribes and small kingdoms owing tribute to an overlord and of the proportionate liability or quota imposed on each of them. This is expressed in terms of hides, though we have no details as to how these were arrived at nor how they were converted into a cash liability.Stenton p.295. See also Cyril Hart: The Tribal Hidage in Transactions of the Royal Historical Society 5th series Vol.21 (1971) The Burghal Hidage (early 10th century) is a list of boroughs giving the hide assessments of neighbouring districts which were liable to contribute to the defence of the borough, each contributing to the maintenance and manning of the fortifications in proportion to the number of hides for which they answered.Stenton p.265. See also David Hill & A.R.Rumble (edd): The Defence of Wessex - The Burghal Hidage (1996) The County Hidage (early 11th century) lists the total number of hides to be assessed on each county and it seems that by this time at least the total number of hides in a given area was imposed from above. Each county was assigned a round number of hides, for which it would be required to answer. For instance, at an early date in the 11th century, Northamptonshire was assigned 3,200 hides, while Staffordshire was assigned only 500.Stenton, p. 646. This number was then divided up between the hundreds in the county. Theoretically there were 100 hides in each hundred, but this proportion was often not maintained, for example because of changes in the hundreds or in the estates comprising them or because assessments were altered when the actual cash liability was perceived as being too high or too low or for other reasons now unknown. The hides within each hundred were then divided between villages, estates or manors, usually in blocks or multiples of 5 hides, though this was not always maintained. Differences from the norm could result from estates being moved from one hundred to another, or from adjustments to the size of an estate or alterations in the number of hides for which an estate should answer.Stenton, pp.644-6; Darby, pp.1-12. As each local community had the task of deciding how its quota of hides should be divided between the lands held by that community, different communities used different criteria, depending on the type of land held and on the way in which an individual's wealth was reckoned within that community, it is self-evident that no single comprehensive definition is possible. ==After the Norman conquest== The Norman kings, after the Norman Conquest, continued to use the system which they found in place. Geld was levied at intervals on the existing hidage assessments. In 1084, William I laid an exceptionally heavy geld of six shillings upon every hide. At the time the value of the hide was approximating twenty shillings a year, and the price of an ox was two shillings. Thus the holder of a hide had a tax burden equivalent to three of his oxen and close upon one-third of the annual value of his land. A more normal rate was 2 shillings on each hide. Domesday Book, recording the results of the survey made on the orders of William I in 1086, states in hides (or carucates or sulungs as the case might be) the assessed values of estates throughout the area covered by the survey. Usually it gives this information for 1086 and 1066, but some counties were different and only showed this information for one of those dates. By that time the assessments showed many anomalies.See for example Darby, pp. 106-8, and Bailey. Many of the hide assessments on lands held by tenants-in-chief were reduced between 1066 and 1086 in order to effect an exemption from or reduction in tax; this again shows that the hide is a tax assessment, not an area of land.Harvey (1987) pp.257ff Sometimes, the assessment in hides is given both for the whole manor and for the demesne land (i.e. the lord's own demesne) included in it. Dr Sally Harvey has suggested that the ploughland data in Domesday Book was intended to be used for a complete re-assessment but, if so, it was never actually made.Harvey pp.186-189 The Pipe Rolls, where they are available, show that levies were based largely on the old assessments, though with some amendments and exemptions. The last recorded levy was for 1162-3 during the reign of Henry II, but the tax was not formally abolished and Henry II thought of using it again between 1173 and 1175. The old assessments were used for a tax on land in 1193-4 to raise money for King Richard's ransom.See J.A.Green ==Relationship to other terms== A hide was usually made up of four virgates although exceptionally Sussex had eight virgates to the hide.Dennis Haselgrove. The domesday record of Sussex in Brandon's. South Saxons. pp. 198-199 A similar measure was used in the northern Danelaw, known as a carucate, consisting of eight bovates, and Kent used a system based on a \\"sulung\\", consisting of four yokes, which was larger than the hide and on occasion treated as equivalent to two hides.Stenton, pp. 281-2, 647 These measures had a different origin, signifying the amount of land which could be cultivated by one plough team as opposed to a family holding, but all later became artificial fiscal assessments. In some counties in Domesday Book (e.g. Cambridgeshire), the hide is sometimes shown as consisting of 120 acres (30 acres to the virgate), but as Darby explains: \\"The acres are, of course, not units of area, but geld acres, i.e. units of assessment\\". In other words, this was a way of dividing the tax assessment on the hide between several owners of parts of the land assessed. The owner of land assessed at 40 notional (or 'fiscal') acres in a village assessed at 10 hides and paying geld of 2 shillings per hide would be responsible for one- third () of 2 shillings‚Äîthat is, 8 pence‚Äîthough his land might be considerably more or less than 40 modern statute acres in extent.Darby (1971) p.274 and see Maitland (1987 edition) p.475 == Notes References== * Bailey, Keith, The Hidation of Buckinghamshire, in Records of Buckinghamshire, Vol.32, 1990 (pp. 1‚Äì22) * *Charles-Edwards, T.M., Kinship, Status and the Origins of the Hide in Past & Present, Vol. 36 1972 (pp. 3‚Äì33) * Darby, Henry C., Domesday England, Cambridge University Press, 1977 * Darby, Henry C.; The Domesday Geography of Eastern England, Cambridge university Pree, 1971 * Delbr√ºck, Hans, trans.

Cornish Language Partnership. also spelt Luxullian or Luxulian, is a village and civil parish in mid Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The village lies four miles (6.5 km) northeast of St Austell and six miles (10 km) south of Bodmin.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 200 Newquay & Bodmin The population of the parish was 1,371 in the 2001 census.GENUKI website; Luxulyan. Retrieved April 2010 This had risen to 1,381 at the 2011 census. ==Geography and geology== Luxulyan parish lies in an area of china clay quarries on the St Austell granite batholith (see also Geology of Cornwall) and numerous small granite domes are dotted around the parish. Luxulyan Quarry, a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest to the north of the village, exposes examples of this rock. Luxulyanite, a rare type of Cornish granite (named after the village) is found in the area and was used for the Duke of Wellington's sarcophagus in St Paul's Cathedral. Luxulyan is best known for Luxulyan Valley, a steep sided and thickly wooded stretch of the valley of the River Par that contains a major concentration of early 19th century industrial remains, including a combined Aqueduct and Viaduct. The valley was designated a World Heritage Site in 2006. One of the southern branches of the Saints' Way long-distance footpath runs through the parish. Other villages in Luxulyan parish include the Churchtown, Bridges, Treskilling, Rosemelling, Higher Menadue, and Bodwen. The Atlantic Coast Line from Par to Newquay runs up the Luxulyan Valley and there is a station at Luxulyan. A bus service connects the village with St Austell. ==History and antiquities== St Sulien, or Sulian, was abbot here during the sixth century. The church in the village may have been dedicated to him originally, but it is now dedicated to Saints Ciricius (Cyr, Cyriacus, Quiricus) and Julitta. Luxulyan church The cross in the churchyard A small granite dome near Luxulyan Treffry Viaduct in Luxulyan Valley There are roads in Luxulyan named after all three saints. Sulien is a Welsh variant of the given name \\"Julian,\\" but has also been interpreted as being derived from the Welsh sul, meaning \\"sun\\" + geni, meaning \\"born,\\" Sulien being the name of a Celtic solar deity.Doble, G. H. (1970) The Saints of Cornwall: part 5. Truro: Dean and Chapter; pp. 104‚Äì126 In the early 1980s Luxulyan was the site of a six-month occupation of farmland by much of the village population, with many groups and individuals from across Cornwall helping, to prevent test drilling by the Central Electricity Generating Board investigating the area as a potential nuclear power station site. Luxulyan has benefited from increased tourism since the nearby Eden Project opened. ===Antiquities=== Arthur Langdon (1896) recorded three Cornish crosses and one cross base in the parish. One cross is in the churchyard (illustrated above right); it was brought there in the 19th century from Three Stiles near Consence. Another cross is at Methrose and the third at Trevellan (lying horizontally and built into a hedge). The cross base is at Trevellan Lane End.Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard; pp. 64-65, 81-82 & 423 Andrew Langdon (1994) does not mention the cross at Methrose. Trevellan Cross was removed from the hedge and erected at Lockengate in 1903; in 1972 it was moved a few yards to the crossroads on the A391.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; pp. 53-54 ===Notable buildings=== Parish church The parish church, originally Norman, was entirely rebuilt in granite in the 15th century. It is dedicated to St Ciricius and St Julitta. The tower is without buttresses or pinnacles and the south porch has battlements and a handsome tunnel-vault. It still has the Norman font (very similar to that at St Austell) and the east window is a monument to Silvanus Trevail, d. 1903. Near the church is a holy well (also 15th century).Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; p. 150Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall; 2nd ed. revised by E. Radcliffe. Penguin; p. 109 The Cornish Stannary Court of the Tinners' Parliament kept its records, seal and charter stored in a turret of the church tower. During the English Civil War these were removed to Lostwithiel and then disappeared.Hadfield, John, ed. (1980) The Shell Book of English Villages. London: Michael Joseph; p. 257 Houses and forts Prideaux House was built in 1808 for Sir John Colman Rashleigh. It is a square granite block of three by three bays and has a double depth plan. Above the stairwell is a rectangular lantern. The service wing to the rear is of the same date. Behind the house on higher ground is the earlier Prideaux manor house, Prideaux Old Manor. It was built in the 16th century but has been much altered since then and in the 19th century was used as stables.Beacham, Peter; Pevsner, Nikolaus (2014). Cornwall. New Haven and London: Yale University Press; p. 333 Methrose is a farmhouse probably of the early 16th century (\\"one of the best farmhouses in Cornwall\\"‚ÄîPevsner); it is built of granite and stands on the right of a courtyard. The service end is of two storeys and the later parlour wing was attributed by Charles Henderson to Nicholas Kendall (some time between 1622 and 1649).Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall; 2nd ed. revised by E. Radcliffe. Penguin; p. 118 The remains of an Iron-Age hillfort known as Prideaux Castle are located in the southern portion of the parish near the border with St Blazey. ===Treasure trove=== In 1864 a dispute arose over silver and gold coins, from the reigns of Queen Elizabeth, King James and King Charles I, which were found in the parish churchyard. The Duchy of Cornwall had asserted its right to them as treasure trove, but the Solicitor to the Treasury questioned this, asking for copy documents under which \\"the claim of the Duchy was founded.\\" The Duchy sent copies of the Charters of its creation and correspondence stating that, as the Coroner is the officer responsible for treasure trove, and the Duke has the right of appointing the Coroner within Cornwall, the treasure trove belonged to the Duchy. It also argued that the 3rd Duchy Charter \\"expressly prohibits any such Minister of the Crown acting within Cornwall.\\" In response the Government Attorney and Solicitor General advised that the Treasury back down as could not hold an Inquest of Treasure within the Duchy of Cornwall and that they could not execute any writs because of the exclusion of all Ministers of the Crown from entering any lands of the Duchy.Kirkhope, John, The Duchy of Cornwall and the Crown: Disputes and Accommodation ==Notable people== Notable people from Luxulyan include William O'Bryan, the Methodist preacher and founder of the Bryanites or Bible Christians, and Silvanus Trevail, the architect.

It is sometimes referred-to as ground hugging or terrain hugging flight. The term nap-of-the-earth flight may also apply but is more commonly used in relation to low-flying military helicopters, which typically do not use terrain-following radar. The technology was originally developed by Ferranti for use with the TSR-2 aircraft.R. J. Starling, C.M. Stewart, (1971) \\"The Development of Terrain Following Radar: An account of the progress made with an airborne guidance system for low flying military aircraft\\", Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology, Vol. 43 Iss: 4, pp. 13‚Äì15 https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/eb034756. via Emerald InsightTSR2 Terrain Following Radar Development ‚Äì 1959 to 1964 stevebroadbent.net, (pdf) Recollections of Bill Blain, Ferranti Defence Systems Ltd. Edinburgh ==Technology== TSR-2 XR220 at RAF Museum Cosford, 2002. Ferranti developed terrain following radar specifically for the TSR-2. The system works by transmitting a radar signal towards the ground area in front of the aircraft. The radar returns can then be processed to see how the terrain ahead varies, and then used by the aircraft's flight computers to calculate flight-path changes in order to maintain a reasonably constant height above the earth. The computer will consider many factors in determining the flight path for the aircraft, such as distance to the forward terrain, aircraft speed and velocity, angle of attack and quality of signal being returned. ==Use in strike aircraftAdvantages and disadvantages=== Terrain following radar is primarily used by military strike aircraft, to enable flight at very low altitudes (sometimes below 100 feet/30 metres) and high speeds. Since radar detection by enemy radars and interception by anti-aircraft systems require a line of sight to the target, flying low to the ground and at high speed reduces the time that an aircraft is vulnerable to detection to a minimum by hiding the aircraft behind terrain as far as possible. This is known as terrain masking. However, radar emissions can be detected by enemy anti-aircraft systems with relative ease once there is no covering terrain, allowing the aircraft to be targeted. The use of terrain-following radar is therefore a compromise between the increased survivability due to terrain masking and the ease with which the aircraft can be targeted if it is seen. Even an automated system has limitations, and all aircraft with terrain-following radars have limits on how low and fast they can fly. Factors such as system response-time, aircraft g-limits and the weather can all limit an aircraft. Since the radar cannot tell what is beyond any immediate terrain, the flight path may also suffer from \\"ballooning\\" over sharp terrain ridges, where the altitude becomes unnecessarily high. Furthermore, obstacles such as radio antennas and electricity pylons may be detected late by the radar and present collision hazards. ===Integration and use=== On aircraft with more than one crew, the radar is normally used by the navigator and this allows the pilot to focus on other aspects of the flight besides the extremely intensive task of low flying itself. Most aircraft allow the pilot to also select the ride \\"hardness\\" with a cockpit switch, to choose between how closely the aircraft tries to keep itself close to the ground and the forces exerted on the pilot. Some aircraft such as the Tornado IDS have two separate radars, with the smaller one used for terrain-following. However more modern aircraft such as the Rafale with phased array radars have a single antenna that can be used to look forward and at the ground, by electronically steering the beams. F-111C employs TFR ==Other uses== Terrain-following radar is sometimes used by civilian aircraft that map the ground and wish to maintain a constant height over it. Military helicopters may also have terrain-following radar. Due to their lower speed and high maneuverability, helicopters are normally able to fly lower than fixed-wing aircraft. ==Alternatives== There are very few alternatives to using terrain-following radar for high-speed, low altitude flight. TERPROM, a terrain-referenced navigation system provides a limited but passive terrain-following functionality. ==See also== *Phased array *Active electronically scanned array ==References== *Krachmalnick, F.M., Vetsch, G.J., and Wendl, M.J.

Additionally, he has performed as a solo act, and his cover of the unreleased Bon Jovi song \\"Does Anybody Really Fall In Love Anymore\\" (which had already been covered by Cher on her Heart of Stone album) cracked the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. He also played a cameo role as a forklift driver in Wes Craven's Shocker. Roberts is notable for his Rambo-like appearance and physique and his usage of an electric guitar shaped like a machine gun. ==Career== Roberts was the guitarist who played on Alice Cooper's Constrictor and Raise Your Fist and Yell and their respective tours. He is the man responsible for Alice's metal years in the late 1980s, as he co-wrote nearly every track from those albums. Just by being on stage, he was a part of the show with his huge physique and rocket shooting guitars. After Raise Your Fist, Roberts released his first solo album, Kane Roberts, which featured Cooper's lyrics on \\"Full Pull.\\" He then guested on Cooper's 1989 Trash album, playing guitar on \\"Bed of Nails,\\" which he co-wrote. Two years later, he released a second solo album, Saints and Sinners, which contained the Bon Jovi-penned \\"Does Anybody Really Fall in Love Anymore?\\", previously recorded by Cher as well. While he is primarily a guitar player, Roberts is also a skilled vocalist, capable of extreme high range, as is evident on his solo projects. He has contributed backing vocals on several albums, including Steve Vai's Sex & Religion, Desmond Child's Discipline, and the song \\"Shocker\\" by the Dudes of Wrath, which served as the title track from the 1989 film of the same name. His additional musical contributions include playing on the Bob Ezrin-produced Count Three & Pray album by Berlin, and the 1986 Rod Stewart album Every Beat of My Heart. He also co-wrote \\"Take It Off\\" with Paul Stanley and Bob Ezrin, which appeared on Kiss' Revenge album. Roberts took a long hiatus from music after his second solo album, but returned in 1999 with a band called Phoenix Down, named for a life potion in the video game franchise Final Fantasy. Phoenix Down recorded two albums, entitled Under A Wild Sky and New Place Now.https://www.sickthingsuk.co.uk/08-musicians/m-kaneroberts.php Fans of both say that much of the record is inspired by the seventh game in the series, one of Roberts' favorite games. After several years away from the music industry, working in graphic arts and as a video game programmer, Roberts began work on a new album, Touched, in 2006. On October 23, 2011, Roberts performed with Talon at Firefest VIII, marking his first live performance in over twenty years. In 2012, Roberts released Unsung Radio, a collection of previously unreleased tracks. In 2016, Roberts featured on a track for the Northern Ireland-based hard rock outfit, Maverick. The track and video (also featuring Kane) for \\"Asylum\\" also included Jakob Samuel from Sweden's The Poodles. On January 25, 2019, Roberts released a new solo album, The New Normal, on Frontiers Records. In late 2019 it was reported that Kane Roberts is working on his next solo album which was described as being heavier than the previous album. ==DiscographyStudio albums=== *Kane Roberts (1987) * Saints and Sinners (1991) * Unsung Radio (2012) * The New Normal (2019) ===with Alice Cooper=== *Constrictor (1986) *Raise Your Fist and Yell (1987) ===with Phoenix Down=== *Under a Wild Sky (1999) *New Place Now (2000) ===Guest appearances=== *\\"Bed of Nails\\" guitar (on the Alice Cooper album Trash) (1989) ==References== Category:Alice Cooper members Category:American heavy metal guitarists Category:Guitarists from Massachusetts Category:Living people Category:1962 births Category:20th-century American guitarists ","title":"Kane Roberts"},{"id":"2220937","text":"Luxulyan railway station serves the civil parish and village of Luxulyan in mid-Cornwall, England. The station is situated on the Atlantic Coast Line, measured from . Great Western Railway manage the station and operates all the trains that call. ==History== The first railway at Luxulyan was a horse-worked line from Par Harbour to Molinnis which was built by Joseph Treffry, opening on 18 May 1847. It climbed up the side of the Luxulyan Valley on a cable- worked incline and then crossed it on the Treffry Viaduct. On 1 June 1874 a new line was opened by the Cornwall Minerals Railway. Running from Fowey to Newquay, it bypassed the incline, instead passing beneath the Treffry Viaduct and entering Luxulyan through the 50 yard (46m) Luxulyan Tunnel. The tramway was retained from Luxulyan over the Treffry Viaduct to a quarry at Colcerrow until about 1933. A passenger service was introduced on 20 June 1876 when a station was provided at Bridges, which was renamed \\"Luxulyan\\" 1 May 1905. The passing loop was lengthened in 1910 and again on 10 May 1936. The two original platforms were replaced by an island platform between the tracks as part of the 1910 alterations. A camping coach was kept in the goods yard for several years for hiring out to tourists who arrived by train. A new siding to serve the Treskilling China Clay Works was opened in 1916. This survived until 1975 but the public goods yard closed on 27 September 1964, as did the connection to the stub of the Colcerrow branch east of the station. The passing loop and the second platform face were taken out of use at the same time. ==Description== There is a single platform on the east side of the track which has a shelter and seats. At the southern end of this is the car park which connects to a small lane that leads to the village's main road. This lane crosses over the railway on a stone bridge a short distance south of the platform. The station has a solar powered help point which allows waiting people to find out when the next trains will arrive. ==Services== Luxulyan is a request stop on the line, so passengers wishing to alight must inform the conductor and passengers wishing to join the train must signal to the driver. The typical service is one train every two hours in each direction between Par and Newquay, with some services extending to Plymouth and one train in the summer extending to Penzance. On summer Saturdays, there is just one train per day in each direction due to the intercity services running through to Newquay in lieu of the local services. Trains are usually operated by Class 150 Sprinters. ==Community rail== The trains between Par and Newquay are designated as a community rail service and is supported by marketing provided by the Devon and Cornwall Rail Partnership. The line is promoted under the Atlantic Coast Line name. The Kings Arms pub in Luxulyan is part of the Atlantic Coast Line rail ale trail. ==References== * * * ==External links== *LuxSoft: Derailment of a High Speed Train in the Valley Category:Railway stations in Cornwall Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1876 Category:Railway stations served by Great Western Railway Category:Railway request stops in Great Britain ","title":"Luxulyan railway station"},{"id":"2220938","text":"Drillers Stadium was a formerhttp://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/drillers/tulsa-athletics-host- farewell-game-for-drillers-stadium-on-saturday/article_7074eabd- ffb7-52ea-9b90-49c885738311.html minor league baseball stadium located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. From 1981 to 2009, Drillers Stadium was home to the Tulsa Drillers, of the Double-A Texas League. For a number of years Drillers Stadium also hosted one of the regular season baseball games played between Oklahoma State University and the University of Oklahoma in the Bedlam Series. Drillers Stadium is located on the southwest corner of Yale Avenue and 15th Street, in the Tulsa State Fairgrounds complex that also includes Expo Square Pavilion, the QuikTrip Center and Golden Driller, a racetrack, a waterpark, and the sites of the former Bell's Amusement Park and of Oiler Park, where Tulsa's professional baseball teams had played since 1934. ==Baseball== After the Tulsa Oilers, a Triple-A team, left Tulsa in 1976 due to the continuing deterioration of Oiler Park, followed by the partial collapse of the Oiler Park grandstand during a 1977 exhibition game, Tulsa County's long-delayed efforts to build a new stadium were accelerated. The new 8,000 seat stadium was completed in 1981 and named Robert B. Sutton Stadium, in honor of its chief benefactor, a local oil executive. However, Sutton was convicted in 1982 on obstruction of justice charges, and the ballpark was renamed Tulsa County Stadium.\\"Tycoon who helped fund Drillers Stadium dies\\", Tulsa World, July 7, 2009.

Originally a multi-purpose stadium with an artificial surface playing field, it later acquired a Prescription Athletic Turf (PAT) grass surface. Though it primarily served as a baseball stadium, monster truck rallies and concerts were also held there. On December 19, 2008, construction began on ONEOK Field, a new ballpark in downtown Tulsa.

These times would stand as the respective world records for 18 and 19 years, and are considered to be among the greatest sports performances ever.CNNSI.com's 100 Greatest Women Athletes ==Early life== Meagher is the daughter of two-time Notre Dame basketball letterman James L. Meagher. She was a competitive athlete from an early age. At the 1979 Pan American Games in San Juan, Puerto Rico, she set her first world record‚Äîat the age of 14‚Äîin the 200-meter butterfly. \\"When she was a teenager, Mary showed no weaknesses,\\" reflected Dennis Pursley, one of her early coaches. \\"Every athlete I've ever known had some form of weakness, be it in terms of motivation, technique or physical attributes, but Mary was the exception.\\" She graduated from the Sacred Heart Academy high school in Louisville, Kentucky, alongside her sister, future U.S. Representative Anne Northup. ==1980 Boycott and on== Meagher was expected to compete for medals at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Russia. However, Meagher, along with the rest of the United States Olympic team, never got her chance due to the American-led boycott of the Moscow Olympics. However, in 1981 Meagher gave one of the most memorable performances in competitive swimming at the U.S. Swimming National Championships held in Brown Deer, Wisconsin in 1981. At the meet, Meagher set world records in both the 200-meter and 100-meter butterfly, the two primary distances at which the butterfly is contested in competitive swimming. The times for both records were considered astonishing, especially the record of 57.93 seconds that Meagher set in the 100-meters‚Äîa drop of over a second. Both times would stand as the world records for nearly two decades: American swimmer Jenny Thompson lowered the 100-meter record in 1999, while Susie O'Neill of Australia set the record in the 200-meter a year later. Some have argued that Meagher's records in the butterfly were among the most impressive records ever set in sport, let alone swimming, ranking among such noteworthy records as Bob Beamon's long jump world record in 1968. These two swims led Meagher to being named Female World Swimmer of the Year by Swimming World Magazine, which she again won in 1985. Meagher attended the University of California, Berkeley, where she swam for the California Golden Bears swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Pacific-10 Conference competition. She received the Honda Sports Award for Swimming and Diving twice, recognizing her as the outstanding college female swimmer of the year in 1984‚Äì85 and again in 1986‚Äì87.Collegiate Women Sports Awards, Past Honda Sports Award Winners for Swimming & Diving. Retrieved December 3, 2014. In 1987, she also won the Honda Broderick Cup as the nation's top female collegiate athlete. She graduated from the University of California in 1987 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in social sciences. At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Meagher won gold medals in both the 100-meter and 200-meter butterfly races, along with another gold by swimming the butterfly leg of the women's 4√ó100-meter medley relay for the winning U.S. team in the event final. Returning to compete at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, Meagher won a bronze medal in the 200-meter butterfly. By the time she left competitive swimming, Meagher had won 24 U.S. national swimming titles. ==Personal life== Meagher was the 10th of 11 siblings. She married former speed skater Mike Plant. They now live in Peachtree City, Georgia, with their two children, Maddie and Drew. Mike Plant's brother and Meagher's brother-in-law, Tom Plant, was also a speed skater and Olympian. Meagher's older sister Anne Meagher Northup served as a US Congresswoman.

The term optics is used because magnetic and electrostatic lenses act upon a charged particle beam similarly to optical lenses upon a light beam. Electron optics calculations are crucial for the design of electron microscopes and particle accelerators. In the paraxial approximation, trajectory calculations can be carried out using ray transfer matrix analysis. An einzel lens, a specific type of electrostatic lens. This figure shows the electron path. Six plates are parallel to the flight path with the middle plate at a particular potential. (This diagram was made for positive ions, and shows a positive voltage on the central plate. For electrons this voltage must be negative.) == Electron properties == Electrons are charged particles (point charges with rest mass) with spin 1/2 (hence they are fermions). Electrons can be accelerated by suitable electric (or magnetic) fields, thereby acquiring kinetic energy. Given sufficient voltage, the electron can be accelerated sufficiently fast to exhibit measurable relativistic effects. According to wave particle duality, electrons can also be considered as matter waves with properties such as wavelength, phase and amplitude. == Geometric electron optics  Magnetic fields === Electrons interact with magnetic fields according to the second term of the Lorentz force: a cross product between the magnetic field and the electron velocity. In an infinite uniform field this results in a circular motion of the electron around the field direction with a radius given by: : r = \\\\frac{mv_\\\\perp}{eB} where r is the orbit radius, m is the mass of an electron, v_\\\\perpis the component of the electron velocity perpendicular to the field, e is the electron charge and B is the magnitude of the applied magnetic field. Electrons that have a velocity component parallel to the magnetic field will proceed along helical trajectories. === Electric fields === In the case of an applied electrostatic field, an electron will deflect towards the positive gradient of the field. Notably, this crossing of electrostatic field lines means that electrons, as they move through electrostatic fields change the magnitude of their velocity, whereas in magnetic fields, only the velocity direction is modified. As electrons can exhibit non-particle (wave-like) effects such as diffraction, a full analysis of electron paths can be obtained by solving Maxwell's equation‚Äîhowever in many situations, the particle interpretation may provide a sufficient approximation with great reduction in complexity. One further property of electrons is that they interact strongly with matter as they are sensitive to not only the nucleus, but also the matter's electron charge cloud. Therefore, electrons require vacuum to propagate any reasonable distance, such as would be desirable in electron optic system. Penetration in vacuum is dictated by mean free path, a measure of the probability of collision between electrons and matter, approximate values for which can be derived from Poisson statistics. === Quantum theory === Although not very common, it is also possible to derive effects of magnetic structures to charged particles starting from the Dirac equation. ==Diffractive electron optics== A sub- relativistic free electron propagating in vacuum can be accurately described as a de Broglie matter wave with a wavelength inversely proportional to its longitudinal momentum. As a result of the charge carried by the electron, electric fields, magnetic fields, or the electrostatic mean inner potential of thin, weakly interacting materials can impart a phase shift to the wavefront of an electron. Thickness-modulated silicon nitride membranes and programmable phase shift devices have exploited these properties to apply spatially varying phase shifts to control the far-field spatial intensity and phase of the electron wave. Devices like these have been applied to arbitrarily shape the electron wavefront, correct the aberrations inherent to electron microscopes, resolve the orbital angular momentum of a free electron, and to measure dichroism in the interaction between free electrons and magnetic materials or plasmonic nanostructures. == See also == * Charged particle beam * Strong focusing * Electron beam technology * Electron microscope * Beam emittance * Ernst Ruska * Hemispherical electron energy analyzer ==Further reading== * Hawkes, P.

It was formed in March 1983 in Warsaw by two well-known Polish underground musicians: Robert Brylewski (formerly of Brygada Kryzys) and Pawe≈Ç Kelner (formerly of Deuter). ==Information== According to Brylewski, \\"Izrael's creation was a consequence of the death of Brygada Kryzys. During last rehearsals of Brygada Kryzys only three musicians were present: Kelner, me and Tomasz Lipinski. There was nobody else. It was the end of 1982, hard times for Polish independent rockers. At some point Tomasz put his guitar on the side and said \\"I quit.\\" Izrael's debut took place on April 25, 1983, in the Hybrydy student club in Warsaw, where the band rehearsed. The first recording, \\"IdƒÖ ludzie Babilonu,\\" was made later that year and quickly gained popularity. The band started to play in numerous concerts (such as at the Festival in Jarocin, and a series of concerts called God's Music in Babylon). It also supported the group Misty in Roots when they came to Poland. In May 1983, the first LP, Biada, biada biada, was recorded, but it was not delivered to stores until many months later. In 1986, Kelner decided to quit and was replaced by Darek \\"Maleo\\" Malejonek (formerly of Kultura), with whom the second album, Nabij fajƒô, was recorded. At that time, Izrael's musicians decided to accept any person who would like to play with them and who would bring something creative. Several musicians therefore became members of Izrael, including jazzmen, which was unusual for a reggae band. Altogether, approximately 100 musicians have been members of Izrael at one time or another. In 1987, the third album, Duchowa Rewolucja, was recorded. Around the year 1989, Izrael became an established band with Brylewski, Vivian Brylewska (Robert's wife), Maleo, Piotr \\"Stopa\\" ≈ªy≈ºelewicz and Alik Dziki. In the same year, the band went on a tour to then-Communist Czechoslovakia. Shortly afterwards, Wlodzimierz Kiniorski joined as a new member. He played several instruments, including the saxophone and the flute. In 1990, the band went to Great Britain on an invitation from Marcin Miller. There they played several concerts and, more importantly, recorded an LP, 1991, which is regarded as one of the best albums in the history of Polish music. 1991 was recorded at a \\"Ariwa Sounds,\\" a studio owned by Mad Professor. After their return to Poland, Izrael played numerous concerts and the band was enthusiastically embraced by fans. In 1994, the concert album Live 93 was issued, which included songs recorded live in Krak√≥w and Bia≈Çystok. The band was at the height of its popularity, thinking about a new LP. In 1995, the band was suddenly disbanded. According to Brylewski, \\"[the band's] history was fulfilled\\", since it was not created to sell records and make money. In 1997, Brylewski released the album In Dub‚Äîa dubbed mix of the band's best songs. In 2006, the band, temporarily known as Magnetosfera, played a few concerts. Izrael returned in 2007 and reportedly is preparing a new album. == Discography == { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:15em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Album details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\"  Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" POL - ! scope=\\"row\\" Biada, biada biada  * Released: 1985 * Label: Pronit * Formats: LP, CD, CS  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" Nabij Faje  * Released: 1986 * Label: Pronit * Formats: LP, CD, CS  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" Duchowa rewolucja vol. 1  * Released: 1987 * Label: Arston * Formats: LP, CD, CS  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" Duchowa rewolucja vol. 2  * Released: 1991 * Label: Arston * Formats: LP, CD, CS  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" 1991  * Released: 1991 * Label: D.N.A. * Formats: LP, CD, CS  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" Live 93  * Released: 1994 * Label: Phonex * Formats: CD, CS  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" In dub  * Released: 1997 * Label: Z≈Çota Ska≈Ça * Formats: CD, CS  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" D≈ºa Ludzie  * Released: November 10, 2008 * Label: Lemon Records * Formats: CD  22 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Izrael Meets Mad Professor And Joe Ariwa  * Released: December 6, 2010 * Label: W Moich Oczach * Formats: LP, CD  ‚Äî -  colspan=\\"20\\" style=\\"font-size:90%\\"  \\"‚Äî\\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. } ==References * Izrael in a 1985 BBC movie \\"My blood, your blood\\", together with interview with Brylewski and Malejonek * Izrael at the 1993 Jarocin Festival * Izrael live in 2007 Category:Polish alternative rock groups Category:Polish reggae musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1983 ","title":"Izrael (band)"},{"id":"2220969","text":"Realtime is a barbershop quartet that won the Barbershop Harmony Society's International Quartet Championship in 2005.

It has an average elevation of with a width of . The pass is located between the Nilgiri Hills to the north and Anaimalai Hills to the south. ==Origin and history== Topography- Palakkad (Palghat) Gap & Bharathapuzha River. There are various theories about the origin of Palakkad gap. One among them is that it is caused by the landslide due to rivers flowing in opposite directions. The Bharatha Puzha river originates in the Palakkad Gap from rivulets and tributaries feeding from steep escarpment slopes along the flanks of the Ghats.Nair, Dr. S. Sathis Chandran, (20 May 2004). A Note on the Ecological Impact of the Proposed Pathrakkadavu Hydro-Electric Project (PHEP) in the Kunthi River, Palakkad District of Kerala: India - Silent Valley Rainforest Under Threat Once More Palakkad gap has played a major role in enabling human migration into Kerala from parts of Tamil Nadu. From 300 B.C. to 13th century, it also helped the Cheras rule the entire Kerala and the Kongu Nadu as one geographical unit from Karur in Western Tamil Nadu. Tamil Brahmins migrated to Palakkad from Central Tamil Nadu via the Palakkad gap from the 15th century to 18th century. ==Effect on weather== The gap affects the weather patterns in Southern India as it allows the moisture-laden Southwest monsoon winds into western Tamil Nadu, moderating summer temperatures and generating greater rainfall in the region relative to the rest of lowland Tamil Nadu. It also allows the hot winds coming from Tamil Nadu which warm the eastern part of Kerala compared to the rest of the state and the tropical cyclone winds from Bay of Bengal bearing rain during the summer. ==Transport and trade== The gap is the lowest pass through the Western Ghats in the region. It is an important mountain pass in the Western Ghats that runs along the entire eastern edge of Kerala isolating it from the neighboring Tamil Nadu. It acts as an important transport corridor between the two States by linking Palakkad District of Kerala with Coimbatore District of Tamil Nadu and has served as a vital trade route between the east and west coasts of peninsular India since ancient times. Both the National Highway 544 and the Coimbatore - Shoranur railway line , Palakkad - Pollachi Railway line joining Kerala to Tamil Nadu pass through the gap. The gap also helps for VHF line of sight communications between the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. ==Wind Energy== The Palakkad Gap funnels the winds blowing from the west on to Coimbatore and Tirupur districts in Tamil Nadu making the region one of the major wind power generation areas. The average annual wind speed is 18‚Äì22 km/hr. Large windmill farms can be seen in and around Udumalaipettai and Madathukulam. ==See also== * Aryankavu mountain pass. * Aralvaimozhi ==Gallery== Train negotiating Palghat Gap.jpgPalghat Gap as seen from Coimbatore-Shoranur railway line Palghat Gap 2.jpgPalghat Gap as seen from Palghat-Chitoor Road Walayar_as_seen_from_line.jpgWestern Ghats as seen from Coimbatore-Shoranur rail line View of Ghats.jpgView of Ghats Palghat-Coimbatore Rd.Through the gap..jpgPalghat-Coimbatore NH 47 runs through the gap Southern end of the Gap..jpgSouthern end of the gap One end of the Gap..jpgOne end of the gap Train in Walayar Forest.jpgA passenger train in Palghat gap ==References *View of Palghat Gap from the Nelliampathy Mountain ranges Category:Mountain passes of the Western Ghats Category:Geography of Palakkad district Category:Tourist attractions in Palakkad district Category:Mountain passes of Kerala Category:Transport in Palakkad district ","title":"Palakkad Gap"},{"id":"2220978","text":"LIUNA's headquarters is in the Moreschi Building in downtown Washington, D.C. The Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA, often shortened to just the Laborers' Union) is an American and Canadian labor union formed in 1903. As of 2017, they had about 500,000 members, about 80,000 of whom are in Canada. The current general president is Terence M. O'Sullivan who was appointed general president in 2000, elected by delegates in 2001, and re- elected in 2006. There are nine regions across North America; these regions are further divided into 500 local unions. One region is in Toronto Canada and is led by Joseph Mancinelli, Local 183, which is the largest construction local union in North America. ==History1900‚Äì1920=== LIUNA‚Äôs origins stretch back to the 19th century when local construction unions began popping up across the United States. Then, in March 1903, Samuel Gompers, the President of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), successfully persuaded various local construction unions from across the U.S. to unite in order to consolidate power in their fight against unfair labor practices. As a result, on April 13, 1903, the International Hod Carriers and Building Laborers‚Äô Union (IHC and BLC) was established at its founding convention in Washington D.C. At the convention there were 25 delegates from 23 unions in 17 different cities in attendance. During the course of the convention the delegates elected a General President, Herman Lilien, a General Secretary-Treasurer, Harold Stemburgh, and adopted a Declaration of Principles. Also, the delegates were able to produce the union's first charter, which claimed jurisdiction over: \\"Wrecking of buildings, excavations of buildings, digging of trenches, piers and foundations, holes, digging, lagging, sheeting of said foundations, holes, and caisson work, concrete for buildings, whether foundations, floors or any other, whether done by hand or any other process, tending to masons, mixing and handling all materials used by masons (except stone setters), building of centers for fireproofing purposes, tending to carpenters, tending to and mixing of all materials for plastering, whether done by hand or any other process, clearing of debris from buildings, shoring, underpin- ning and raising of old buildings, drying of plastering, when done by sala- mander heat, handling of dimension stones.\\" Nine years later, in 1912, the IHC and BLC experiences two name changes. First, in September, the union‚Äôs name was changed to the International Hod Carriers and Common Laborers of America. Then, in December, the name was changed again to the International Hod Carriers' Building and Common Laborers of America. During the early 20th century, the union achieved considerable wage raises for members in Pittsburgh, New York City, New York and Chicago, and orchestrated strikes in Boston, St. Louis and Philadelphia. By 1920, membership had climbed to 96,000. The union backed calls by African American workers to be allowed full and equal status as union members, denying permission for segregated unions to be founded in Kansas City and Cincinnati. ===1921‚Äì1940=== In 1929, the union expanded to include the Tunnel and Subway Contractors‚Äô International Union. Then, eight years later, the union expanded again to include the Pavers' International Union. However, during the Great Depression of the 1930s, membership fell to under 30,000 as more and more people lost their jobs. In 1940, the union moved its international headquarters from Massachusetts to Washington D.C. Also, in October of that year, union dues were suspended in support of the U.S.‚Äôs impending involvement in WWII. ===1941‚Äì1960=== By 1942, despite the decline in union membership during the early years of the Great Depression, membership climbed back up to more than 400,000 - over half of which left their jobs to serve in World War II. In September 1946, at the general convention in Chicago, the union created a monthly journal called The Laborer. However, the first issue of The Laborer was not published until June 1947. A few months later, in September, the union signed its first national pipeline agreement, which protected wages, benefits, and safety conditions for pipeline workers. During the 1950s, the union made significant gains concerning health and welfare benefits. For example, in 1956, laborers in Pittsburg were able to form pension plans. Also, in 1955, the union helped establish the National Joint Heavy and Highway Construction Committee. The purpose of the committee was to ensure that union members could take advantage of the jobs created by the Interstate Highway Act of 1954. ===1961‚Äì1980=== In 1962, the Laborers met with President John F. Kennedy at the White House to pledge not to discriminate when hiring. Later, after President Kennedy was assassinated, the union went back to the White House yet again, this time to pledge support for President Lyndon B. Johnson‚Äôs \\"war on poverty.\\" Union members even participated in Martin Luther King Jr.‚Äôs 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. In 1965, the union was renamed the Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA). A year later, LIUNA created the Laborers‚Äô Political League in order to both influence politics and encourage its members to participate in the political process. In 1968, the union expanded to include over 60,000 new workers from the National Association of Post Office Mail Handlers, Watchmen, Messengers and Group Leaders. Also, the Journeyman Stone Cutters Association of North America joined with the union as well. During the 1970s, LIUNA continued to push for improved education and training for its workers despite a slowdown in construction projects. For instance, in 1971, LIUNA‚Äôs Laborers ‚Äì Associated General Contractors Fund completed a film and held its first national training conference. In addition, LIUNA helped hospital workers organize under the AFL-CIO‚Äôs Public Employee Department in 1974. Also in that year, LIUNA signed a national agreement with Bricklayers and Masonry contractors. In 1976, LIUNA began training women to work in construction with funds from the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act. Other notable achievements for LIUNA during the 1970s were newly established pension plans in central and southern states, legal services for members of Louisiana local 229, and a vision center for members in Massachusetts. ===1981‚Äì2000=== The 1980s were tough times for labor in general due to President Ronald Reagan‚Äôs tough stance on unions. However, there were some successes for LIUNA. In 1981, LIUNA locals in New York sought to improve their benefits by offering drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs. Also, in that same year, LIUNA created the New England Laborers‚Äô Training Academy (NELTA). The purpose of NELTA was to spread awareness of the dangers of asbestos and teach union members how to safely remove it. Then, just six years later, LIUNA signed a national agreement with the Asbestos Abatement Contractors Association insuring safer working conditions for all its members. Two years prior to that, the union won another significant victory when the Department of Labor formally recognized highway flaggers as members of LIUNA. This was important because it gave the highway flaggers better protection for their wages. In 1988, LIUNA established the Laborers‚Äô Health and Safety Fund of North America, which was a co-venture between labor and management to help improved health and safety for workers. One year later, LIUNA locals in Baltimore and Washington D.C. followed the example set by New York unions and instituted drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs. These programs have since been expanded to unions across the rest of America. During the 1990s, LIUNA experienced a number of new organizing initiatives to improve and expand the union. By 1994, the United States Department of Labor had recognized construction as an apprenticeable occupation, which allowed LIUNA to establish its own apprenticeship program. In 1998, LIUNA created its Public Employee Department. As a result, LIUNA added approximately 5,200 Riverside, Ca. County workers along members of the Canadian Licensed Practical Nurses Association. Branches of the LIUNA were found to have been infiltrated by organized crime in the 1990s. In one particular case, the Buffalo, New York wing of the Italian mafia controlled Local 210 of the LIUNA for decades. A protracted investigation into the union's operations over the course of a decade eventually drove the crime family out of the union by 2006. ===2001‚ÄìPresent=== In 2001, members of the LIUNA participated in the clean up at Ground Zero in New York following the September 11 terrorist attacks. In 2003, the same year the Laborers' Union celebrated its 100th anniversary, it also spearheaded the creation of its first construction charter school. The Cranston Public Schools Construction and Career Academy is a high school that teaches students about the construction industry and how to get into it. At the 2011 convention, LIUNA passed several resolutions to help invest in political activism through the organization‚Äôs Political Action Committee (PAC). On June 1, 2006, O'Sullivan announced that LIUNA had disaffiliated from the AFL-CIO and joined the Change to Win Federation.\\"Laborers' Announce Official Split With AFL-CIO As of June 1.\\" Engineering News-Record. May 29, 2006; \\"Laborer's to Make AFL- CIO Break Official.\\" Chicago Sun Times. May 23, 2006. However, LIUNA officials said on August 13, 2010, that the union would leave Change to Win and rejoin the AFL-CIO in October 2010.\\"Construction Workers' Union to Rejoin A.F.L.-C.I.O.\\", Associated Press. August 14, 2010. In May 2016, in the midst of the 2016 United States presidential election, LIUNA donated US$1 million to Priorities USA Action, a SuperPAC which supports Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. == Membership == According to LIUNA's Department of Labor records since 2005, when membership classifications were first reported, the union's membership has been in a slow decline across all categories except \\"retired\\" members, which reports a slight increase during the period. The most drastic decline, by over half, has been in \\"mail handlers associate\\" members, which is the second largest category of members and the only category reported as ineligible to vote in the union. LIUNA contracts also cover some non-members, known as agency fee payers, which since 2006 have numbered comparatively less than 1% of the size of the union's membership.

The original was exhibited at the Academy after the death of the philosopher (348/347 BC). Platonism is the philosophy of Plato and philosophical systems closely derived from it, though contemporary platonists do not necessarily accept all of the doctrines of Plato. Platonism had a profound effect on Western thought. Platonism at least affirms the existence of abstract objects, which are asserted to exist in a third realm distinct from both the sensible external world and from the internal world of consciousness, and is the opposite of nominalism.\\" Philosophers who affirm the existence of abstract objects are sometimes called platonists; those who deny their existence are sometimes called nominalists. The terms \\"platonism\\" and \\"nominalism\\" have established senses in the history of philosophy, where they denote positions that have little to do with the modern notion of an abstract object. In this connection, it is essential to bear in mind that modern platonists (with a small 'p') need not accept any of the doctrines of Plato, just as modern nominalists need not accept the doctrines of medieval Nominalists.\\" \\"Abstract Objects\\", Gideon Rosen, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). This can apply to properties, types, propositions, meanings, numbers, sets, truth values, and so on (see abstract object theory). Philosophers who affirm the existence of abstract objects are sometimes called platonists; those who deny their existence are sometimes called nominalists. The terms \\"platonism\\" and \\"nominalism\\" also have established senses in the history of philosophy, where they denote positions that have little to do with the modern notion of an abstract object.\\"Abstract Objects\\", Gideon Rosen, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). In a narrower sense, the term might indicate the doctrine of Platonic realism. The central concept of Platonism, a distinction essential to the Theory of Forms, is the distinction between the reality which is perceptible but unintelligible, associated with the flux of Heraclitus and studied by the likes of science, and the reality which is imperceptible but intelligible, associated with the unchanging being of Parmenides and studied by the likes of mathematics. Geometry was a main motivation of Plato, and this also shows the influence of Pythagoras. The Forms are typically described in dialogues such as the Phaedo, Symposium and Republic as perfect archetypes of which objects in the everyday world are imperfect copies. Aristotle's Third Man Argument is its most famous criticism in antiquity. In the Republic the highest form is identified as the Form of the Good, the source of all other Forms, which could be known by reason. In the Sophist, a later work, the Forms being, sameness and difference are listed among the primordial \\"Great Kinds\\". Plato established the Academy, and in the 3rd century BC, Arcesilaus adopted academic skepticism, which became a central tenet of the school until 90 BC when Antiochus added Stoic elements, rejected skepticism, and began a period known as Middle Platonism. In the 3rd century AD, Plotinus added mystical elements, establishing Neoplatonism, in which the summit of existence was the One or the Good, the source of all things; in virtue and meditation the soul had the power to elevate itself to attain union with the One. Many Platonic notions were adopted by the Christian church which understood Plato's Forms as God's thoughts (a position also known as divine conceptualism), while Neoplatonism became a major influence on Christian mysticism in the West through Saint Augustine, Doctor of the Catholic Church, who was heavily influenced by Plotinus' Enneads,O'Connell SJ, RJ, The Enneads and St Augustine's Vision of Happiness. Vigiliae Christianae 17 (1963) 129-164 (JSTOR) and in turn were foundations for the whole of Western Christian thought.Pelikan, Jaroslav. The Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine. Vol 1: The Emergence of the Catholic Tradition 100-600; Pelikan, Jaroslav. The Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine. Vol 3: The Growth of Mediaeval Theology 600-1300, section, \\"The Augustinian Synthesis\\". Many ideas of Plato were incorporated by the Roman Catholic Church. ==Philosophy== Timaeus detail from the Vatican fresco The School of Athens The primary concept is the Theory of Forms. The only true being is founded upon the forms, the eternal, unchangeable, perfect types, of which particular objects of moral and responsible sense are imperfect copies. The multitude of objects of sense, being involved in perpetual change, are thereby deprived of all genuine existence.Oskar Seyffert, (1894), Dictionary of Classical Antiquities, page 481 The number of the forms is defined by the number of universal concepts which can be derived from the particular objects of sense. The following excerpt may be representative of Plato's middle period metaphysics and epistemology: > [Socrates:] \\"Since the beautiful is opposite of the ugly, they are two.\\" > [Glaucon:] \\"Of course.\\" > \\"And since they are two, each is one?\\" > \\"I grant that also.\\" > \\"And the same account is true of the just and unjust, the good and the bad, > and all the forms. Each of them is itself one, but because they manifest > themselves everywhere in association with actions, bodies, and one another, > each of them appears to be many.\\" > \\"That's right.\\" > \\"So, I draw this distinction: On one side are those you just now called > lovers of sights, lovers of crafts, and practical people; on the other side > are those we are now arguing about and whom one would alone call > philosophers.\\" > \\"How do you mean?\\" > \\"The lovers of sights and sounds like beautiful sounds, colors, shapes, and > everything fashioned out of them, but their thought is unable to see and > embrace the nature of the beautiful itself.\\" > \\"That's for sure.\\" > \\"In fact, there are very few people who would be able to reach the > beautiful itself and see it by itself. Isn't that so?\\" > \\"Certainly.\\" > \\"What about someone who believes in beautiful things, but doesn't believe > in the beautiful itself and isn't able to follow anyone who could lead him > to the knowledge of it? Don't you think he is living in a dream rather than > a wakened state? Isn't this dreaming: whether asleep or awake, to think that > a likeness is not a likeness but rather the thing itself that it is like?\\" > \\"I certainly think that someone who does that is dreaming.\\" > \\"But someone who, to take the opposite case, believes in the beautiful > itself, can see both it and the things that participate in it and doesn't > believe that the participants are it or that it itself is the participants-- > is he living in a dream or is he awake? > \\"He's very much awake.\\" > (Republic Bk. V, 475e-476d, translation G.M.A Grube) Book VI of the Republic identifies the highest form as the Form of the Good, the cause of all other Ideas, and that on which the being and knowing of all other Forms is contingent. Conceptions derived from the impressions of sense can never give us the knowledge of true being; i.e. of the forms. It can only be obtained by the soul's activity within itself, apart from the troubles and disturbances of sense; that is to say, by the exercise of reason. Dialectic, as the instrument in this process, leading us to knowledge of the forms, and finally to the highest form of the Good, is the first of sciences. Later Neoplatonism, beginning with Plotinus, identified the Good of the Republic with the transcendent, absolute One of the first hypothesis of the Parmenides (137c-142a). Platonist ethics is based on the Form of the Good. Virtue is knowledge, the recognition of the supreme form of the good. And, since in this cognition, the three parts of the soul, which are reason, spirit, and appetite, all have their share, we get the three virtues, Wisdom, Courage, and Moderation. The bond which unites the other virtues is the virtue of Justice, by which each part of the soul is confined to the performance of its proper function. Platonism had a profound effect on Western thought. In many interpretations of the Timaeus Platonism,cf. Proclus' commentary on the Timaeus; Cornford 1937 like Aristotelianism, poses an eternal universe, as opposed to the nearby Judaic tradition that the universe had been created in historical time, with its continuous history recorded. Unlike Aristotelianism, Platonism describes idea as prior to matter and identifies the person with the soul. Many Platonic notions secured a permanent place in Christianity.\\"Platonism.\\" Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 ==History Ancient philosophy === The Academy Site of Plato's Academy in Athens Platonism was originally expressed in the dialogues of Plato, in which the figure of Socrates is used to expound certain doctrines, that may or may not be similar to the thought of the historical Socrates, Plato's master. Plato delivered his lectures at the Academy, a precinct containing a sacred grove outside the walls of Athens. The school continued there long after Plato's death. There were three periods: the Old, Middle, and New Academy. The chief figures in the Old Academy were Speusippus (Plato's nephew), who succeeded him as the head of the school (until 339 BC), and Xenocrates (until 313 BC). Both of them sought to fuse Pythagorean speculations on number with Plato's theory of forms. The Skeptical Academy Around 266 BC, Arcesilaus became head of the Academy. This phase, known as the Middle Academy, strongly emphasized philosophical skepticism. It was characterized by its attacks on the Stoics and their assertion of the certainty of truth and our knowledge of it. The New Academy began with Carneades in 155 BC, the fourth head in succession from Arcesilaus. It was still largely skeptical, denying the possibility of knowing an absolute truth; both Arcesilaus and Carneades argued that they were maintaining a genuine tenet of Plato. Middle Platonism Around 90 BC, Antiochus of Ascalon rejected skepticism, making way for the period known as Middle Platonism, in which Platonism was fused with certain Peripatetic and many Stoic dogmas. In Middle Platonism, the Platonic Forms were not transcendent but immanent to rational minds, and the physical world was a living, ensouled being, the World-Soul. Pre-eminence in this period belongs to Plutarch. The eclectic nature of Platonism during this time is shown by its incorporation into Pythagoreanism (Numenius of Apamea) and into Jewish philosophyhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/Platonism/Medieval- Platonism#ref32576 (Philo of Alexandria). Neoplatonism Many Western churchmen, including Augustine of Hippo, have been influenced by Platonism. In the third century, Plotinus recast Plato's system, establishing Neoplatonism, in which Middle Platonism was fused with mysticism. At the summit of existence stands the One or the Good, as the source of all things.Oskar Seyffert, (1894), Dictionary of Classical Antiquities, page 484 It generates from itself, as if from the reflection of its own being, reason, the nous, wherein is contained the infinite store of ideas. The world-soul, the copy of the nous, is generated by and contained in it, as the nous is in the One, and, by informing matter in itself nonexistent, constitutes bodies whose existence is contained in the world-soul. Nature therefore is a whole, endowed with life and soul. Soul, being chained to matter, longs to escape from the bondage of the body and return to its original source. In virtue and philosophical thought it has the power to elevate itself above the reason into a state of ecstasy, where it can behold, or ascend to, that one good primary Being whom reason cannot know. To attain this union with the Good, or God, is the true function of human beings. Plotinus' disciple, Porphyry, followed by Iamblichus, developed the system in conscious opposition to Christianity. The Platonic Academy was re-established during this period; its most renowned head was Proclus (died 485), a celebrated commentator on Plato's writings. The Academy persisted until Roman emperor Justinian closed it in 529. === Medieval philosophy === Christianity and Platonism Platonism has had some influence on Christianity through Clement of Alexandria and Origen, and the Cappadocian Fathers.Armstrong, A. H., ed., The Cambridge History of Later Greek and Early Medieval Philosophy, Cambridge, 1970. St. Augustine was heavily influenced by Platonism as well, which he encountered through the Latin translations of Marius Victorinus of the works of Porphyry and/or Plotinus. Platonism was considered authoritative in the Middle Ages. Platonism also influenced both Eastern and Western mysticism.Louth, Andrew. The Origins of the Christian Mystical Tradition: From Plato to Denys. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983. Meanwhile, Platonism influenced various philosophers. While Aristotle became more influential than Plato in the 13th century, St. Thomas Aquinas's philosophy was still in certain respects fundamentally Platonic. ===Modern philosophy===  Renaissance  The Renaissance also saw a renewed interest in Platonic thought, including more interest in Plato himself. In 16th-, 17th-, and 19th-century England, Plato's ideas influenced many religious thinkers including the Cambridge Platonists. Orthodox Protestantism in continental Europe, however, distrusts natural reason and has often been critical of Platonism. An issue in the reception of Plato in early modern Europe was how to deal with the same-sex elements of his corpus.Reeser, Todd W. 2016. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Christoplatonism is a term used to refer to a dualism opined by Plato, which holds spirit is good but matter is evil, which influenced some christian churches, though the Bible's teaching directly contradicts this philosophy and thus it receives constant criticism from many teachers in the Christian Church today. According to the Methodist Church, Christoplatonism directly \\"contradicts the Biblical record of God calling everything He created good.\\" === Contemporary philosophy === Modern Platonism Apart from historical Platonism originating from thinkers such as Plato and Plotinus, we also encounter the theory of abstract objects in the modern sense. > Platonism is the view that there exist such things as abstract objects ‚Äî > where an abstract object is an object that does not exist in space or time > and which is therefore entirely non-physical and non-mental. Platonism in > this sense is a contemporary view.Platonism in Metaphysics (Stanford > Encyclopedia of Philosophy) Most contemporary platonists trace their views to those of Gottlob Frege. This modern Platonism has been endorsed in one way or another at one time or another by numerous philosophers, such as Bernard Bolzano, who argue for anti- psychologism. = Analytic = In contemporary philosophy, most platonists trace their ideas to Gottlob Frege's influential paper \\"Thought,\\" which argues for platonism with respect to propositions, and his influential book, The Foundations of Arithmetic, which argues for platonism with respect to numbers and is a seminal text of the logicist project. Contemporary analytic philosophers who espoused Platonism in metaphysics include Bertrand Russell, Alonzo Church, Kurt G√∂del, W. V. O.

On October 15, 2004, he attended the two- day event in Venice Beach, California, where he was among eight finalists chosen. After surviving the first day of eliminations he admitted that he was actually 40 years old ‚Äî five years over the competition's cut off point ‚Äî and not 30 as he'd claimed. As a result, he was cut from the competition. Though he had been cut from Tough Enough, WWE officials invited him to come to their developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) for possible training. He trained between January and June 2005, making his OVW debut on June 25, 2005. During a dark match pitting the team of Seth Skyfire and Robert Fury against Robbie Dawber and his partner, Wright entered the ring and squashed all three men, no-selling the offense of Skyfire in the process. He then announced that he was \\"The Boogeyman\\" before leaving the building. The Boogeyman gimmick further evolved into a \\"monster\\" face who would appear when another wrestler said his name and attack him, while not selling any offense he received. SmackDown! (2005‚Äì2007) On the July 11, 2005 episode of Raw, horror movie-style vignettes began airing to promote the debut of \\"The Boogeyman\\". After a few weeks, the vignettes were moved from Raw to SmackDown!, but the planned debut was delayed when Wright hyperextended both knees and needed time to recover. He made his debut on the October 14, 2005 episode of SmackDown!, being brought in by network executive Palmer Cannon as part of a \\"new talent initiative\\". The storyline referenced to vignettes months ago as promos for a television series on the network called \\"The Boogeyman\\". The show was cancelled before it could air, but they still had the actor under contract, so he was brought to SmackDown! to wrestle. The Boogeyman then proceeded to recite a modified version of the chant One, two, Freddy's coming for you from the movie A Nightmare on Elm Street before smashing an oversized alarm clock on his own head. For the next few weeks, The Boogeyman appeared in unexpected places backstage (closets, vans, et cetera), reciting different nursery rhymes and holding up clocks before screaming his catchphrase \\"I'm The Boogeyman and I'm comin' to get'cha!\\" and laughing maniacally. At Survivor Series, The Boogeyman helped SmackDown! general manager Theodore Long defeat his Raw counterpart, Eric Bischoff. He made his official in-ring debut on the December 2 episode of SmackDown!, defeating Simon Dean in a squash. During this match, he took a handful of live worms from his pocket and stuffed them into his mouth. Over the next few weeks, Boogeyman's opponents were generally \\"flattened\\" in the ring, left with worms in their mouths and/or spit on their faces. His official pay-per-view debut was at December's Armageddon when he came to the ring to confront Vito and Nunzio who were dressed as Santa Claus and an elf. Boogeyman's first major feud occurred with John Bradshaw Layfield (JBL) and his \\"fixer\\" Jillian Hall, and it began when he stalked the duo throughout a number of shows. During the January 6 episode of SmackDown!, he caught a fleeing Hall and shoved worms down the back of her skirt. On the January 13 taping of SmackDown!, during a Piper's Pit segment, The Boogeyman not only sniffed a \\"growth\\" on Jillian's face, but then licked it, bit it off and ate it. The Boogeyman faced JBL at the Royal Rumble, winning in under two minutes. After defeating The Dicks in a handicap match on the February 24 episode of SmackDown!, The Boogeyman dumped a bucket of worms on the announce table, frightening special guest commentators Booker T and his wife Sharmell. The Boogeyman subsequently began to stalk Booker T and Sharmell over the next few weeks. He and Booker T were set to face off on the March 18 Saturday Night's Main Event XXXII, but the match was canceled due to Booker T faking a knee injury to escape competition. The feud eventually culminated at WrestleMania 22, with The Boogeyman defeating Booker T and Sharmell in a handicap match. During the match, Boogeyman kissed Sharmell with a mouthful of worms. The match had to be cut short because of a biceps tear at a house show. To explain his absence to rehab his injury, Booker T and Sharmell obtained a restraining order against The Boogeyman on the April 7 episode of SmackDown!. As SummerSlam approached, The Boogeyman began appearing in TV spots to promote the event. Vignettes also began airing advertising his return to SmackDown!. On September 20, WWE.com reported that Wright had been released from the company, however, on October 6, WWE.com announced that Wright had re-signed with the company and would be sent to be trained at Booker T and Stevie Ray's wrestling school in Houston, Texas. Wright returned on the October 27 episode of SmackDown!, attacking and spitting worms into the faces of The Miz and Kristal Marshall. During the feud he again terrorized and stalked his opponents, and eventually ended The Miz's undefeated streak at the Armageddon pay-per-view on December 17. Wright then feuded with Finlay, who ended The Boogeyman's undefeated streak when Hornswoggle interfered. On the February 2 edition of SmackDown! during a match against Chris Benoit for the WWE United States Championship, Boogeyman abducted Hornswoggle, distracting Finlay and giving Benoit a chance to win the match with a roll-up. On the February 16 edition of SmackDown! The Boogeyman appeared with a little person of his own, Little Boogeyman, who was portrayed by an actor named Chris Hollyfield. Chris also previously had played Lil Booker T. His purpose was to counteract Hornswoggle, who was proving a problem in one-on-one matches with Finlay. The Boogeyman and the Little Boogeyman lost to Finlay and Hornswoggle in a mixed tag team match at No Way Out. The team lost a rematch the following week on SmackDown!; Little Boogeyman was pinned by Finlay, after Wright had chased away Hornswoggle. On OVW's 400th anniversary show, The Boogeyman made an appearance, losing to Ryan Wilson in a tables match. The Boogeyman returned to in ring action when teamed with Kane during his feud with William Regal and Dave Taylor. This also marked the return of Little Boogeyman. The feud would be short lived as Boogeyman and Little Boogeyman would then start another feud with Finlay and Hornswoggle. Boogeyman and Little Boogeyman were defeated in a mixed tag match by Finlay and Hornswoggle at Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIV on June 2. The Boogeyman ended his tenure on SmackDown! with a loss to Mark Henry in a squash match, as part of Henry's new \\"Path of Destruction\\" gimmick. After that match, Mark Henry then beat up Little Boogeyman who was at ringside, and Henry gave him a body splash, (kayfabe) severely injuring him. ECW and departure (2007‚Äì2009) On the June 11 edition of Raw, The Boogeyman was drafted to the ECW brand in the annual WWE draft. The next day he debuted for the brand and defeated Matt Striker, beginning a feud with him. On July 10 in New Orleans, The Boogeyman was a guest during a Striker's Classroom segment, ostensibly to be educated on worms, only to be attacked by Striker's debuting enforcer, Big Daddy V. The Boogeyman was not seen for the next three weeks, finally re-emerging on the July 31 episode ‚Äî with a new face paint design and black contact lenses ‚Äî to scare Big Daddy V off after he finished a match. Boogeyman was taken out by Big Daddy V from behind after a distraction from Striker a week later. On the August 14 episode of ECW, Boogeyman scored a disqualification victory over ECW Champion John Morrison after Morrison shoved the referee. Boogeyman went on to successfully team with CM Punk at Saturday Night's Main Event XXXV on August 18 against Morrison and Big Daddy V. On the August 28 episode of ECW, Boogeyman was one of the participants in the Fatal Four Way match for a shot at Morrison's title; however, CM Punk was the victor. On September 4, on ECW, Boogeyman defeated Matt Striker by disqualification when Big Daddy V interfered, and went on to hit Boogeyman with a ghetto drop on the outside of the ring. On the September 18 episode of ECW, Boogeyman and Big Daddy V finally faced off in their first one-on-one match, which Boogeyman lost. Boogeyman's return to wrestling action was initially delayed due to a torn calf muscle, but it had also been reported that he was having dental surgery done to replace missing teeth. On the October 7 episode of ECW a vignette was aired promoting The Boogeyman's return. Additional vignettes aired for a few weeks after that. On the October 13, 2008 edition of Raw, The Boogeyman made his return, appearing during a segment with Jackass's Johnny Knoxville, Chris Pontius, and Big Dick Johnson ending with The Boogeyman bringing live worms out of a bag and after putting them in his own mouth spat them into the mouth of Pontius. The Boogeyman made his ECW return on the November 25 episode, in a segment with John Morrison and The Miz. He made his return to in ring competition on December 9 against Scott Reed, a local talent, who he defeated with ease. On the December 30 episode of ECW, he lost to John Morrison and The Miz in a No DQ match with Finlay as his partner. On the January 20, 2009 edition of ECW, he defeated Paul Burchill by disqualification, his first victory over a non-enhancement talent since returning to the brand. His last appearance on WWE programming was on the March 3 episode of ECW where he lost in a match against Kane. The next day on March 4, 2009, WWE announced that they had released Wright from his WWE contract. ===Independent circuit (2009‚Äì2017, 2019)=== After WWE, Wright returned to the Pro Wrestling Alliance using his Boogeyman gimmick. Later, using a new gimmick called Slither, he wrestled at Northeast Wrestling as The Nightcrawler, defeating Jake Manning. Wright made his debut for The Millennium Wrestling Federation (MWF) at Soul Survivor VI on April 24, 2010. He defeated \\"Executioner\\" Brian Milonas. During late December 2011 Wright made an appearance on UWD (United Wrestling Destruction) where he defeated newcomer Harry Janes at the special event \\"Win Or Lose.\\" He returned using his old The Boogeyman gimmick at Cyberstarz event of Millennium Wrestling Federation on February 2012, where he defeated Lukas Sharp. After that, he left the wrestling business for quite some time, before he decided to return on July 9, 2012, where he was available on independent scene bookings. On August 11, 2013, Wright using The Boogeyman gimmick made an appearance for Juggalo Championship Wrestling's Bloodymania 7 teaming with Kongo Kong to face 2 Tuff Tony and a returning Vampiro in a losing effort. On September 3, 2017, as The Boogeyman, he defeated The Horror for All Out Mayhem wrestling. In March 2019 he wrestled the Dreamcather at WWW in a losing effort. In 24 of August he wrestled against Orange Cassidy in Big Time Wrestling and won. ===Return to WWE=== Sporadic appearances (2012‚Äì2019) On the December 16, 2012 episode of Raw, Wright returned as The Boogeyman during the Slammy Awards, sneaking up on former rival Booker T. Boogeyman appeared in Halloween themed videos on the WWE YouTube channel in both November 2013 and October 2014. On the December 22, 2014 episode of Raw, Boogeyman appeared in a segment on the WWE App. On January 25, 2015 at Royal Rumble, Boogeyman entered the Royal Rumble match as a surprise entrant at number 7 marking his first WWE in‚Äìring performance in almost six years, but was quickly eliminated by Bray Wyatt. On November 6, it was announced that Wright has signed a legends contract (a long-term deal to make infrequent, non-wrestling appearances) with WWE. On January 22, 2018, Boogeyman made an appearance on Raw 25 Years. On July 22, 2019, Boogeyman appeared at the Raw Reunion show, and scared Drake Maverick in the locker room, helping Pat Patterson pin Maverick and win the WWE 24/7 Championship. ==Personal life== Wright has been married to his wife Melissa George since 1984. As of 2018, Wright is working as an aerobics instructor in Denver, Colorado. ==Other media== In January 2013, Wright appeared on two short promos featuring Bobby Lashley to promote Lashley's family fitness center in Aurora, Colorado named American Top Team Altitude. In 2015, Wright appeared in two episodes of the WWE Network series, Swerved, a hidden camera prank show by Jackass co-creator Jeff Tremaine. In 2018, he appeared on the House Hardy Halloween special that aired on WWE Network. Wright appears in the video games WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 and WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 as a playable character. 12 years later, he was revealed as a post-launch DLC superstar for WWE 2K Battlegrounds. Wright has his own training facility in Boulder, Colorado, from which he regularly posts videos of himself helping others lose weight and get in shape. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Alabama Wrestling Federation **AWF Tag Team Championship (1 time) ‚Äì with Bobby Lashley *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **Rookie of the Year (2006) **Ranked No. 114 of the top 500 singles wrestlers in the PWI 500 in 2007 ==References* Category:1964 births Category:African-American male professional wrestlers Category:American male professional wrestlers Category:Living people Category:Professional wrestlers from Arizona Category:Professional wrestling gimmicks Category:Sportspeople from Phoenix, Arizona Category:Tough Enough contestants ","title":"The Boogeyman (wrestler)"},{"id":"2221020","text":"Mission San Francisco de la Espada (also Mission Espada) is a Roman Rite Catholic mission established in 1690 by Spain and relocated in 1731 to present-day San Antonio, Texas, in what was then known as northern New Spain. The mission was built in order to convert local Native Americans to Christianity and solidify Spanish territorial claims in the New World against encroachment from France. Today, the structure is one of four missions that comprise San Antonio Missions National Historical Park. ==History== Founded in 1690 as San Francisco de los Tejas near Weches, Texas and southwest of present-day Alto, Texas, Mission San Francisco de la Espada was the second mission established in Texas. Three priests, three soldiers and supplies were left among the Nabedache Indians. The new mission was dedicated on June 1, 1690. A smallpox epidemic in the winter of 1690-1691 killed an estimated 3,300 people in the area. The Nabedache believed the Spaniards brought the disease and hostilities developed between the two groups. Drought besieged the mission in the summers of 1691 and 1692, and the Nabedache wished to get rid of the mission. Under threat of personal attack, the priests began packing their belongings in the fall of 1693. On October 25, 1693, the padres burned the mission and retreated toward Monclova. The party lost its way and did not reach Monclova until February 17, 1694.Chipman, Donald E. Spanish Texas 1519-1821. University of Texas Press: Austin, Third paperback printing, 1997. p. 99. The mission was re-established in the same area on July 5, 1716 as Nuestro Padre San Francisco de los Tejas. The new mission had to be abandoned in 1719 because of conflict between Spain and France. The mission was tried once more on August 5, 1721 as San Francisco de los Neches. As the Nabedache were no longer interested in the mission, and France had abandoned effort to lay claim in the area, the mission was temporarily relocated along the Colorado River in July 1730. Mission Tejas State Park encompasses the original site of the mission. The mission relocated to its current location in the San Antonio River area (coordinates 29.3177¬∞, -98.4498¬∞) in March, 1731 and was renamed San Francisco De la Espada. A friary was built in 1745, and the church was completed in 1756. The relocation was in part inspired by fears of French encroachment and need for more Missionaries to tend to San Antonio de Bexar's Indian population. The Mission encountered great difficulties in presiding over the Indian population and experienced common rebellious activity. Several modern churches have been architecturally based on the design of this mission including St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Wimberley, Texas, north of San Antonio. == Rancho de las Cabras == Rancho de las Cabras was established between 1750 and 1760, 30 miles southeast of San Antonio de Bexar under the jurisdiction of Mission Espada, so as to provide land for cultivation of crops and livestock for the Mission's population without intruding on private lands. The ranch was primarily made up by low fences and thatched buildings known as jacales for the native workforce to inhabit. According to Ethno-Historian T.N. Campbell, the ranch was likely constructed by Indians not native to Texas. It is listed separately as part of the World Heritage Site. ==Espada Acequia== Mission Espada, 2011 Mission San Francisco de la Espada's acequia and aqueduct can still be seen today. The main ditch continues to carry water to the mission and its former farm lands. This water is still used by residents living on these neighboring lands. The use of acequias was originally brought to the arid regions of Spain and Portugal by the Romans and the Moors. When Franciscans missionaries arrived in the desert Southwest they found the system worked well in the hot, dry environment. In order to distribute water to the missions along the San Antonio River, Franciscan missionaries oversaw the construction of seven gravity-flow ditches, dams, and at least one aqueduct -- a network that irrigated approximately of land.'' == Gallery == Image:Aqueduct 01.jpgThe Espada aqueduct as it crosses Piedras creek Image:Mission Espada Chapel Interior.JPGInterior of the church File:Nativity2009MissionEspada.JPGNativity scene, 2009.

The small group of Puritan settlers, led by a man named William Sayle, were expelled from Bermuda for their failure to swear allegiance to the Crown, and left in search of a place in which they could freely practice their faith. This group represented the first concerted European effort to colonize the Bahamas. ==Background== The mid-17th century was a period of constant religious and political turmoil in England, culminating in the English Civil War. The first part of the conflict was fought between King Charles I and the Parliament of England, and led ultimately to the Protectorship of the Puritan general, Oliver Cromwell. This conflict spread to Bermuda, where a period of civil strife resulted in a victory for the supporters of the Loyalist party. The struggle eventually led to the expulsion of the colony's Puritans and independents to the Bahamas, which the English had laid claim to in 1629, but had not permanently settled. Earlier in 1644, the Bermudian Independent Puritans had sent an expedition to explore these new islands. ==Establishment of the colony== Nevertheless, sometime between spring 1646 and autumn 1648, Sayle took some seventy people to settle in the Bahamas. They made landfall on the island called Cigateo, which they named Eleutheria, from the Greek word for \\"freedom\\", although the name later became Eleuthera. The island's original inhabitants, the Lucayans, had been decimated through the slaving activities of the Spanish and the numerous European diseases, especially smallpox, that followed. William Sayle and his assistant Captain Butler were the persons who began a voyage to The Bahamas in two different vessels. William Sayle's vessel was called the William. During the voyage Captain Butler and William Sayle had an argument with each other about what religious freedom means. As a solution to this problem, Sayle left Captain Butler and went forward to reach the Bahamian Islands. The settlers ran into trouble before they even landed, when they encountered a storm and their ship ran aground onto rocks, later called the Devil's Backbone, north of Spanish Wells. The adventurers found their way ashore and took refuge in what was later called Preacher's Cave, where a religious service was held every year for the next 100 years on the anniversary in thankfulness for their survival. However, although the settlers had shelter, they had lost their provisions so they had no food. Sayle took eight men in a small boat and went to Virginia to help, where he got a ship and supplies and went to relieve the others. More colonists expelled from Bermuda arrived in 1649 and also faced the predicament of inadequate supplies. This time it was the sympathetic Puritans of New England who rallied to their cause and collected ¬£800 for all the supplies they needed, allowing the colony to survive. The Eleutheran people later showed their thankfulness by sending shiploads of the extremely valuable Braziletto wood to Boston, with instructions to sell it and donate the proceeds to Harvard University. Another source of trouble for the colony was dissent within its ranks from the beginning. Before they had even landed, a Captain Butler made so many problems, by refusing to accept any authority, that Sayle and others were obliged to find another island. They named the new island they moved to 'Sayle Island', which was later renamed 'New Providence'. The colony was not an immediate success in economic terms. Its soil yielded little production and the settlers barely got by during their first years, being obliged to live by salvaging what they could from shipwrecks. Sayle, however, was a very resourceful man, and secured a number of supplies from the mainland colonies. Despite this the colony did not do much better in the following years and in the end only a few hardcore settlers from the original Eleutherans were left. Sayle himself went on to become Governor of South Carolina, but continued to have a vested personal interest in Eleuthera. He used this influence to secure some trade for the island and so helped the community through its infancy. This episode is thought to be the historical source of Andrew Marvell's poem \\"Bermudas,\\" written in praise of the Puritan settlers of the New World, and one of the earliest statements of the so-called \\"American Dream\\". According to the Norton Anthology of English Literature (7th ed., p. 1686), \\"The poem was probably written after 1653, when Marvell took up residence in the house of John Oxenbridge, who had twice visited the Bermudas.\\" ==Articles of 1647== The new colony was to be governed by the Articles and Orders of 1647, drawn up by William Sayle. The articles reflect the ambiguities of the English Civil War taking place at that time between Royalists and Parliamentarians. Therefore, while the preamble refers to the Raign of our Soveraign Lord Charles, by the Grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland; Defender of the Faith, &c;, the articles themselves make clear that the new settlement was to be effectively independent, making no further mention of the Crown. On the contrary, the articles speak of the rules governing the Members of the Republick and the Magistracie or officers of the Republicke. The articles established freedom of religion and opinion, three hundred acres of land per settler, governance under a governor and twelve councillors chosen from a senate composed of the first 100 settlers, and humane treatment of any indigenous people still on the island. It has been noted that if Sayle's settlement had been successful, then he would have created in the Bahamas \\"the first democratic state in the New World\\", some 130 years before the American Revolution. ==References *Articles and orders of 1647 of the Eleutheran Adventurers Category:17th-century English Puritans Category:Protestantism in the Bahamas Category:Eleuthera Category:English diaspora in North America Category:History of the Bahamas Category:Republicanism in the Bahamas Category:1647 establishments in the British Empire Category:North America in the English Civil War ","title":"Eleutheran Adventurers"},{"id":"2221031","text":"Magnesia in the distance.

These orbits are subsets of S that can be written as { c1, ..., cl }, such that :œÄ(ci) = ci + 1 for i = 1, ..., l ‚àí 1, and œÄ(cl) = c1. The corresponding cycle of œÄ is written as ( c1 c2 ... cn ); this expression is not unique since c1 can be chosen to be any element of the orbit. The size l of the orbit is called the length of the corresponding cycle; when l = 1, the single element in the orbit is called a fixed point of the permutation. A permutation is determined by giving an expression for each of its cycles, and one notation for permutations consist of writing such expressions one after another in some order. For example, let : \\\\pi = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 6 & 7 & 2 & 5 & 4 & 8 & 3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 & 8 & 7 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 6 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 & 4 & 1 & 3 & 5 & 8 & 7 & 6 \\\\end{pmatrix} be a permutation that maps 1 to 2, 6 to 8, etc. Then one may write :œÄ = ( 1 2 4 3 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 8 ) (7) = (7) ( 1 2 4 3 ) ( 6 8 ) ( 5 ) = ( 4 3 1 2 ) ( 8 6 ) ( 5 ) (7) = ... Here 5 and 7 are fixed points of œÄ, since œÄ(5)=5 and œÄ(7)=7. It is typical, but not necessary, to not write the cycles of length one in such an expression. Thus, œÄ = (1 2 4 3)(6 8), would be an appropriate way to express this permutation. There are different ways to write a permutation as a list of its cycles, but the number of cycles and their contents are given by the partition of S into orbits, and these are therefore the same for all such expressions. == Counting permutations by number of cycles == The unsigned Stirling number of the first kind, s(k, j) counts the number of permutations of k elements with exactly j disjoint cycles. === Properties === :(1) For every k > 0 : s(k, k) = 1. :(2) For every k > 0 : s(k, 1) = (k ‚àí 1)!. :(3) For every k > j > 1, s(k, j) = s(k ‚àí 1,j ‚àí 1) + s(k ‚àí 1, j)*(k ‚àí 1) === Reasons for properties === :(1) There is only one way to construct a permutation of k elements with k cycles: Every cycle must have length 1 so every element must be a fixed point. ::(2.a) Every cycle of length k may be written as permutation of the number 1 to k; there are k! of these permutations. ::(2.b) There are k different ways to write a given cycle of length k, e.g. ( 1 2 4 3 ) = ( 2 4 3 1 ) = ( 4 3 1 2 ) = ( 3 1 2 4 ). ::(2.c) Finally: s(k, 1) = k!/k = (k ‚àí 1)!. :(3) There are two different ways to construct a permutation of k elements with j cycles: ::(3.a) If we want element k to be a fixed point we may choose one of the s(k ‚àí 1, j ‚àí 1) permutations with k ‚àí 1 elements and j ‚àí 1 cycles and add element k as a new cycle of length 1. ::(3.b) If we want element k not to be a fixed point we may choose one of the s(k ‚àí 1, j ) permutations with k ‚àí 1 elements and j cycles and insert element k in an existing cycle in front of one of the k ‚àí 1 elements. === Some values === {  - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" valign=\\"center\\"  k ! colspan=\\"9\\"  j ! - ! 1 ! 2 ! 3 ! 4 ! 5 ! 6 ! 7 ! 8 ! 9 ! sum - ! 1  align=\\"right\\"  1  colspan=\\"8\\"   align=\\"right\\"  1 - ! 2  align=\\"right\\"  1  align=\\"right\\"  1  colspan=\\"7\\"   align=\\"right\\"  2 - ! 3  align=\\"right\\"  2  align=\\"right\\"  3  align=\\"right\\"  1  colspan=\\"6\\"   align=\\"right\\"  6 - ! 4  align=\\"right\\"  6  align=\\"right\\"  11  align=\\"right\\"  6  align=\\"right\\"  1  colspan=\\"5\\"   align=\\"right\\"  24 - ! 5  align=\\"right\\"  24  align=\\"right\\"  50  align=\\"right\\"  35  align=\\"right\\"  10  align=\\"right\\"  1  colspan=\\"4\\"   align=\\"right\\"  120 - ! 6  align=\\"right\\"  120  align=\\"right\\"  274  align=\\"right\\"  225  align=\\"right\\"  85  align=\\"right\\"  15  align=\\"right\\"  1  colspan=\\"3\\"   align=\\"right\\"  720 - ! 7  align=\\"right\\"  720  align=\\"right\\"  1,764  align=\\"right\\"  1,624  align=\\"right\\"  735  align=\\"right\\"  175  align=\\"right\\"  21  align=\\"right\\"  1  colspan=\\"2\\"   align=\\"right\\"  5,040 - ! 8  align=\\"right\\"  5,040  align=\\"right\\"  13,068  align=\\"right\\"  13,132  align=\\"right\\"  6,769  align=\\"right\\"  1,960  align=\\"right\\"  322  align=\\"right\\"  28  align=\\"right\\"  1  colspan=\\"1\\"   align=\\"right\\"  40,320 - ! 9  align=\\"right\\"  40,320  align=\\"right\\"  109,584  align=\\"right\\"  118,124  align=\\"right\\"  67,284  align=\\"right\\"  22,449  align=\\"right\\"  4,536  align=\\"right\\"  546  align=\\"right\\"  36  align=\\"right\\"  1  align=\\"right\\"  362,880 - ! ! 1 ! 2 ! 3 ! 4 ! 5 ! 6 ! 7 ! 8 ! 9 ! sum } == Counting permutations by number of fixed points == The value f(k, j) counts the number of permutations of k elements with exactly j fixed points.

The center is regarded as a public asset according to the Thai Ministry of Finance's Treasury Department. However, it has been managed by N.C.C. Management & Development Co., Ltd., a private firm, since its opening in 1991. The QSNCC was built to host events, especially conferences and exhibitions and has hosted numerous international events. The QSNCC is also home to the Plenary Hall, a theatre style hall, which has a capacity of 6,000 persons. ==History== In September 1987, Mr. Suthee Singhasaneh, the Minister of Finance, and Mr. Kamchorn Sathirakul, the Bank of Thailand Governor jointly signed a deal between the Royal Thai Government and the World Bank/International Monetary Fund (IMF) to host the 46th Annual Meeting of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank Group and IMF in Bangkok between 1 October to 15 October 1991. As a result, the QSNCC was constructed as a sign of Thailand's commitment to host this event. As for the architectural design, a leading Thai architectural firm was assigned to design a structure that reflected Thai culture and heritage for the QSNCC. To ensure that the center would be completed on time, a design-build delivery system was used and the construction started in late 1989. Construction began with 100 designers and more than 1000 construction workers. The bulk of construction was finished by June 1991, under budget and about two months before the scheduled date of August 1991. It was finished in only 16 months. Projects of this magnitude normally take 40 months. On 29 August 1991, King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit officially opened the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center. The center was named after Queen Sirikit in honour of her 60th birthday. The convention center was closed for a 12 billion baht renovation on 26 April 2019 and is scheduled to reopen in May 2022 with three times the original venue space. ==Expo== * 1st ASEAN Seafood Expo & Conference * Miss Universe 1992 ==Gallery== Image:Bkksirikitconvcentr0905a.jpgQueen Sirikit National Convention Center in 2010 Image:‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ê‡∏°‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏µ ‡πÄ‡∏õ‡πá‡∏ô‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ò‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÉ‡∏ô‡∏û‡∏¥‡∏ò‡∏µ‡πÄ‡∏õ‡∏¥‡∏î‡∏á‡∏≤‡∏ô \\"‡∏°‡∏´‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏£‡∏°‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏á‡∏™ - Flickr - Abhisit Vejjajiva (14).jpgIn front of the Convention Center Image:‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ê‡∏°‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏µ ‡πÄ‡∏õ‡πá‡∏ô‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ò‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏Å‡∏•‡πà‡∏≤‡∏ß‡πÄ‡∏õ‡∏¥‡∏î‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ä‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏™‡∏°‡∏±‡∏ä‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏Ç‡∏±‡∏ö‡πÄ - Flickr - Abhisit Vejjajiva.jpgInside Convention Center ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Bangkok Category:Convention centers in Thailand Category:Tourist attractions in Bangkok Category:Khlong Toei District Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1991 Category:1991 establishments in Thailand ","title":"Queen Sirikit National Convention Center"},{"id":"2221046","text":"Forecastfox Weather was a Firefox browser extension created by Ensolis that displays a summary of weather forecast for a given location in the status bar, menu bar or toolbar.

There are also some early references to the southern part of England being termed Surroy, but there is not firm evidence that there was ever a king of arms so called. The title of Clarenceux is supposedly derived from either the Honour (or estates of dominion) of the Clare earls of Gloucester, or from the Dukedom of Clarence (1362). With minor variations, the arms of Clarenceux have, from the late fifteenth century, been blazoned as Argent a Cross on a Chief Gules a Lion passant guardant crowned with an open Crown Or.

He was appointed Gloucester Herald by 22 February 1431. As Gloucester he went to France and as Clarenceux he was sent to Scotland and Normandy, before attending Garter missions to Aragon and Poland. He was married to one Margaret and apparently died poor; one of his books was later divided into four parts (the Military Roll, a roll relating to the Aldermen of London, another to the Kings of England and the last relating to Parliament) which were divided between the British Museum (MSS.

He was a Parliamentarian who took the covenant, intruded in Garter's office (c. 1643) and served on committees to regulate the heralds in 1641 and 1645. Parliament confirmed him as Garter on 20 October 1646 and as Clarenceux in 1650. Although he resigned from the latter eight years later, he was re-appointed in 1661, shortly after he was deposed as Garter during the Restoration. According to Godfrey and Wagner, he was a good armourist; however, his visitations provide only brief accounts of the families concerned, and he neglected his duties, both parliamentary and heraldic, from the 1660s. Despite these failings, he had ensured that the college and its records remained open during the Interregnum, much to the benefit of antiquaries, including his colleague Sir William Dugdale.

He was remembered by contemporaries as \\"a timorous animal\\" and \\"incommunicative, sordid and of little learning\\", but he visited 12 counties as Clarenceux and donated the profits from six towards the rebuilding of the college after the Great Fire of London. His manuscript collection was sold after his death and later sold again at auction; some have returned to the college, but most remain scattered in collections.

Despite this and work at the Navy Office, the family lost out in the South Seas crash and Leake was forced to find employment. After joining the Society of Antiquaries and publishing Nummi Britannici historia, he joined the college as Lancaster Herald in 1727 and was promoted to Norroy in 1729; after serving as Clarenceux, he was promoted to Garter King of Arms in 1754. Leake was less interested in genealogy than the rights and history of the heralds; he petitioned for the college to have a monopoly on the researching of arms and unsuccessfully tried to revive the visitations, a proposal which Anstis and the government opposed. He also opened the college's register for Dissenting and Jewish births and carried out two Garter missions. On his death, his collections passed to his brother and were eventually bought by the college. Godfrey and Wagner, pp. 58-59, 91C. E. A.

According to his predecessor Stephen Martin Leake, he received a large fortune around 1755 and neglected his heraldic duties thereafter. He was nonetheless knighted in 1761.

He was successively appointed Blanch Lyon (1727), Bluemantle (1737), Lancaster (1744), Norroy (1761) and Clarenceux before his appointment as Garter in 1774. Despite his success as a surveyor, he was reputed to have known little of heraldry and neglected his duties at the college.

He was apprenticed to a cheesemonger in 1728 and, after 9 years service, he entered his own trade and carried out his practice for over 20 years. He travelled to the Low Countries and Scotland and supplied cheese to the allied armies during the War of the Austrian Succession; it was on these travels that he began noting down memorial inscriptions, a pursuit to which he would devote his life. He compiled a huge collection of inscriptions relating to Gloucestershire, where he travelled extensively from 1750 onwards. These interests brought him to the college, where he was appointed Bluemantle Pursuivant in 1757 and promoted to Somerset Herald in 1759, Norroy in 1773, Clarenceux and then Garter in 1780. A competent and methodical genealogist and draughtsman, he took a particular interest in parish registers and campaigned for their indexing and the inclusion of greater detail in them. After his death, the majority of his Gloucestershire notes and transcriptions were published, although a number remained in manuscript form until the 1990s. Godfrey and Wagner, pp. 61, 92P. L.

An appointment as Bluemantle Pursuivant followed in 1759, with a promotion to Lancaster Herald two years later; in 1774, he was appointment Norroy King of Arms and Brunswick Herald, before his promotion to Clarenceux in 1780 and then Garter in 1784; he served as Earl Marshal's secretary (1782‚Äì84) and resigned as Brunswick in 1814. Heard was a proponent of the landscape heraldry which proved popular in the late Georgian period, and, inspired by his earlier travels, took a precocious interest in American genealogy. As a long-serving herald, his genealogical practice was large and much of his manuscript collection ended up in the college. Godfrey and Wagner, pp. 61-62, 92D. V.

He used the same means to obtain a place in the college as Bluemantle Pursuivant a year later; promotion to York Herald followed in 1794 after the accidental death of its incumbent. Further appointments as King of Arms to the Royal Guelphic Order and the Order of St Michael and St George (1815 and 1818 respectively) followed before he became Clarenceux, served as deputy Garter at George IV's Coronation in 1821 and was promoted to Garter in 1822. In the latter office, he continued to run a large practice at the college and conducted missions to France, Denmark, Russia and Portugal. Much of his earlier heraldic career involved disputes with the other heralds about his sole right to record pedigrees of the Knight of the Bath; despite objections, he compiled 47 volumes, which are now in the college's possession. He also worked on a history of George IV's Coronation, which was only partially published in his lifetime, and a manuscript history of the Order of the Bath, also owned by the college.

When Diva Search winner Ashley Massaro joined the SmackDown! brand, Marshall was turned heel and put into an angle where she was jealous of Massaro's Diva Search win. She was aligned with Michelle McCool and the two feuded with Massaro and then-babyface, Jillian Hall, leading to a Fatal Four-Way Bra and Panties match at The Great American Bash, during which Marshall was legitimately injured, though she did not miss any time. In September, the next years Diva Search winner, then-babyface, Layla El, arrived on the brand, and Marshall was put into a feud with her. This one had Marshall aligned with Mike \\"The Miz\\" Mizanin against Layla and the Boogeyman. In February 2007, Marshall became a face again and began a storyline which had her as a close friend of then-babyface, Vickie Guerrero, who was mysteriously planning something, and then flirting with SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long. After Marshall confessed her love for Long, she convinced him to hire Guerrero as his assistant, leaving her in charge of the show on occasion. Eventually Long proposed marriage, only to suffer a heart attack during the in-ring wedding on the September 21 episode of SmackDown!. She was released from her WWE contract a few weeks later. ===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2009‚Äì2010)=== On October 18, 2009, at Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's Bound for Glory Marshall debuted as a member of the crowd cheering on Bobby Lashley during his match with Samoa Joe. Renamed Kristal Lashley, she was portrayed as the wife of her real-life boyfriend. She then started an angle with Scott Steiner where Steiner kept harassing her in the crowd during his and Lashley's matches. On the November 5 edition of TNA Impact! Marshall accompanied Lashley to the ring but was sent backstage by the referee where Steiner would try to kidnap her but would get stopped by Lashley. She made her TNA in-ring debut on the December 12 edition of Impact! teaming with Lashley in a losing effort against Steiner and Awesome Kong in a mixed tag team match. On the January 4, 2010, Monday night edition of Impact! Bobby and Kristal Lashley requested for their kayfabe immediate release from TNA Wrestling, turning heel in the process. This storyline did not last, as Bobby Lashley was released from TNA in February to focus more on his MMA career. ==Other media== Marshall has appeared on an episode of Hogan Knows Best. She also appeared on the February 6, 2008 episode of Project Runway with Maria, Candice Michelle, Torrie Wilson, Layla, and Michelle McCool.WWE: Superstars > Divas > Diva Dish > Diva Dish: 'Runway' Divas In June 2007, she posed for her first magazine cover, the September issue of African Americans on Wheels. ==Personal life== Marshall dated Bobby Lashley from 2007-2010, and the couple have a son named Myles who was born in July 2008 and a daughter named Naomi born in 2011. In April 2010, Kristal confirmed on Twitter that she and Lashley had split. She is of Barbadian descent. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHJ1tj4upE&t;=58s ==Championships and accomplishments== *Fitness Universe **Ms. Bikini America (Medium Class; 2008) *NPC Arnold Amateur Championships **2nd Place (Short Class; 2009) *NPC USA Bodybuilding & Figure Championships **1st Place (Class C & Overall; 2009) ==ReferencesKristal Marshall at Online World of Wrestling * Kristal Marshall at 24Wrestling Category:1983 births Category:African-American female professional wrestlers Category:American bloggers Category:American female professional wrestlers Category:Beauty pageant contestants from California Category:Female models from California Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Atlanta Category:Sportspeople from Los Angeles Category:Sportspeople from New York City Category:Sportspeople from Oxnard, California Category:Professional wrestling announcers Category:Professional wrestling managers and valets Category:WWE Diva Search contestants Category:Professional wrestlers from California Category:American women bloggers Category:Game show models Category:Models from Los Angeles Category:Sportspeople from Ventura County, California ","title":"Kristal Marshall"},{"id":"2221074","text":"Franz Ernst Br√ºckmann (September 27, 1697March 21, 1753) was a German mineralogist born at Marienthal near Helmstedt.

The media interest and controversy surrounding the festival, and concerns as to the way it was policed, inspired the legislation that would eventually become the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. ==Background== In May 1992 Avon and Somerset Police tried to end the annual Avon Free Festival, which had been held in the Bristol area around the May Bank Holiday for several years.McKay, G. (1996) Senseless Acts of Beauty: Cultures of Resistance, Page 120, Verso As a result, hundreds of new age travellers en route to the area for the expected festival were shunted into neighbouring counties by Avon and Somerset's Operation Nomad police manoeuvres, with West Mercia Police deciding to confine them to common land at Castlemorton. ==Events== The first travellers arrived on the common on 22 May, but the high-profile coverage in the national media only served to swell the crowd further as ravers from far afield made their way to join the festival, thus making it an impossible task for the authorities to close the event down. An estimated 20,000‚Äì40,000 people gathered on Castlemorton Common for the party which lasted a full week, the biggest of its kind since the Stonehenge Free Festival in the mid-1980s.During, S. (2005) Cultural Studies: A Critical Introduction, Page 131, Routledge Castlemorton hosted many of the large sound systems of the time such as Bedlam, Circus Warp, Spiral Tribe and DiY Sound System, and bands such as Back To The Planet, Xenophobia (fronted by Spiral Tribe's MC Skallywag), AOS3 and Poisoned Electrick Head.Carney, B. (2010) Take Your Protein Pills..., Page 141, Lulu Simon Reynolds wrote retrospectively that, \\"during the next five days of its existence, Castlemorton will inspire questions in Parliament, make the front page of every newspaper in England and incite nationwide panic about the whereabouts of the next destination on the crusty itinerary.\\" Reynolds, S. (1998) Energy Flash, Pages 135-140, Picador Speaking in a House of Commons debate, the local MP at the time, Michael Spicer, opined, \\"new age travellers, ravers and drugs racketeers arrived at a strength of two motorised army divisions, complete with several massed bands and, above all, a highly sophisticated command and signals system. However, they failed to bring latrines. The numbers, speed and efficiency with which they arrived‚Äîamounting at one time to as many as 30,000 people‚Äîcombined to terrorise the local community to the extent that some residents had to undergo psychiatric treatment in the days that followed. Such an incident must never happen again, in my constituency or elsewhere. We need tighter laws, especially to give banning powers to the police; a Cabinet Committee to bring responsible Departments together; quicker and more co-ordinated police action; and a more effective application of existing policies by national and local authorities.\\" ==Outcome== Thirteen members of Spiral Tribe were arrested after the event, and charged with public order offences. After a lengthy and costly trial, they were acquitted. Concerns about the festival and the way in which it was policed inspired the legislation which developed into the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.Fielding, N. (2005) The Police and Social Conflict, Page 113, Routledge Cavendish This wide-ranging Act effectively made illegal such outdoor parties playing music that, as defined in section 63(1)(b), incorporates \\"sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats\\".

Keene (October 12, 1910 ‚Äì April 23, 2005) was one of the first organic farmers. He was the owner of Walnut Acres, in Penns Creek, Pennsylvania. There he produced various food products sold nationally in health food stores and via a mail-order catalog. The foods included free-range chicken; peanut, apple, and other butters; and granola. He was one of the pioneers of the idea of growing food without pesticides or chemical fertilizers. He was born in Lititz, Pennsylvania. He earned an undergraduate degree at Lebanon Valley College and a master's degree in mathematics at Yale University. Before starting Walnut Acres, he taught mathematics at Drew University. He learned about organic farming from Sir Albert Howard while teaching in northern India. When he returned to the US, he studied further at the School of Living, in Suffern, New York and Kimberton Farm School in Pennsylvania. While in India, he was involved with Mohandas Gandhi and the Indian independence movement. He also met his wife while in India. Her name was Enid Betty Morgan, and she was the daughter of missionaries. They were married in 1940; she died in 1987. His first big breakthrough in selling organic foods came when Clementine Paddleford, the New York Herald-Tribune food editor, was entranced by the farm's first product, Apple Essence, an apple butter. Walnut Acres was started just after World War II. In 1994, it had sales of close to $8 million annually. Keene sold the company in 2000.

In Central Europe they occur in the warmer regions, but have become generally rare. By contrast, they are still common in the Mediterranean and Southern Alps. They live in sparse forests and their edges, on dry shrubbery and in orchards.Fauna europaea It is an extreme rarity in Britain, although it used to be widespread throughout England and Wales. Most of the specimens seen in Britain are thought to be captive-bred releases. These butterflies mainly inhabit woodland, especially with sallows (willows). ==Description== Nymphalis polychloros has a wingspan of in males, of in females.UK Butterflies These medium to large butterflies have orange to red wings with black and yellow patches. Both wings with yellowish submarginal lunules, upon which follows a black band which is likewise composed of lunules and bears on the hindwing small blue spots. The underside of the wings is smoky brown with darker shades and black transverse pencilling. There is no sexual dimorphism. This species looks very similar to the small tortoiseshell (Aglais urticae), but it is more closely related to the Camberwell beauty and Nymphalis xanthomelas It differs from the small tortoiseshell by its larger size (45‚Äì62 mm. wingspan in Aglais urticae) and by the more orange ground colour of the upper surface of its wings and the orange base of its hindwings. The forewing is orange-brown, with 3 costal black blotches, 3 large black spots in the disc posteriorly and a narrow blackish terminal band ‚Äì less bright than those of A. urticae, and lacking the apical white spot and the marginal blue dots of that species. Compared to the yellow-legged tortoiseshell it has yellower interspaces between the black blotches on the costal edges of its forewings and the dark marginal band is narrower. The surest way to recognize it, however, is by its dark haired tarsi yellow-legged tortoiseshell‚Äôs tarsal hairs are light- coloured.

In late February or early March the butterflies emerge and mate. The females lay their pale green eggs (ova) in a continuous band around the upper twigs of elm (Ulmus spp.), sallow (Salix caprea and Salix viminalis), pear (Pyrus spp.), Malus, Sorbus, Crataegus, Populus, and Prunus spp. trees.Paolo Mazzei, Daniel Morel, Raniero Panfili Moths and Butterflies of Europe and North Africa The caterpillars (larvae) are gregarious, and systematically strip the topmost twigs of the tree bare. They seem to have little defence against predation by birds. It is possible that their decline and extinction in the British Isles (late 1970s) was owing to the loss of predatory birds, which previously had preyed upon smaller birds if they strayed to the tops of these trees. The full-grown larva spins a silk girdle around a twig further down the tree, and hangs from this by means of hooks (cremaster) at its rear end, to pupate. The chrysalis (pupa) is greyish brown with a slight silvery sheen. The species is univoltine, i.e. there is only one generation per year, the imagines emerging in July and August seek out sources high in sugar on which to feed. Tree sap and fermenting fruit are particularly popular. ==References * de Poitou-Charentes * Lepiforum.de Category:Nymphalis Category:Butterflies of Africa Category:Butterflies of Asia Category:Butterflies of Europe Category:Butterflies of Turkey Category:Butterflies described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Lepidoptera of Cape Verde ","title":"Large tortoiseshell"},{"id":"2221109","text":"In descriptive set theory, a subset of a Polish space has the perfect set property if it is either countable or has a nonempty perfect subset (Kechris 1995, p. 150). Note that having the perfect set property is not the same as being a perfect set. As nonempty perfect sets in a Polish space always have the cardinality of the continuum, and the reals form a Polish space, a set of reals with the perfect set property cannot be a counterexample to the continuum hypothesis, stated in the form that every uncountable set of reals has the cardinality of the continuum. The Cantor‚ÄìBendixson theorem states that closed sets of a Polish space X have the perfect set property in a particularly strong form: any closed subset of X may be written uniquely as the disjoint union of a perfect set and a countable set. In particular, every uncountable Polish space has the perfect set property, and can be written as the disjoint union of a perfect set and a countable open set. The axiom of choice implies the existence of sets of reals that do not have the perfect set property, such as Bernstein sets. However, in Solovay's model, which satisfies all axioms of ZF but not the axiom of choice, every set of reals has the perfect set property, so the use of the axiom of choice is necessary. Every analytic set has the perfect set property. It follows from the existence of sufficiently large cardinals that every projective set has the perfect set property. == References == * Category:Descriptive set theory ","title":"Perfect set property"},{"id":"2221114","text":"KNWD-FM (91.7 FM) is a student-run, non-commercial radio station broadcasting a college format from the campus of Northwestern State University of Louisiana (NSU) and serving Natchitoches, Louisiana. Although the station is licensed to the university's board of trustees, it operates independently from the NSU Department of New Media, Journalism, and Communication Arts; its operations are funded by a student activity fee and its general manager is selected by the Student Media Board. Station staff and management positions are open to all NSU students, as well as students from the Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts. ==History== Planning for what would become KNWD began in 1970 with two competing plans being proposed: an independent student-run station or an academic station connected to NSU's Speech and Journalism Department. The departmental proposal was for an AM station that would be used \\"only as an academic tool,\\" while the student-led proposal was for an independent FM music station. In October 1973, while still working toward final approval for an over-the-air station, students Mike Price, Russell Morrison, and Gary Lampert launched an unlicensed AM carrier current station, KNSU-AM, in their dorm. In November 1973, students approved a referendum assessing a new 50¬¢ fee to support the station, pending approval by the state board of education and a license from the Federal Communications Commission. On April 22, 1974, KNSU-AM went campus-wide on via carrier current, broadcasting primarily contemporary progressive rock from the Russell Library while it awaited an FM license. The station received its non-commercial FM construction permit in August 1974; the application was accelerated by the FCC with the help of the Louisiana congressional delegation. Operating as KNWD-FM (the KNSU call letters having been previously claimed by Nicholls State University), the student-run station officially went on air on September 30, 1975, with the slogan \\"Creative FM Stereo 91.7.\\" KNWD-FM continued to operate out of Russell Library (which later became Russell Hall when the library moved to a new building in the 1970s) until 1988, when the station moved across campus to South Hall, which the station referred to on air as \\"Croce Hall\\" in honor of 1970s singer-songwriter Jim Croce who died in a plane crash in Natchitoches in 1973. In 1995, the station moved once again to Kyser Hall. Equipment for the new station was funded through a $4,200 grant and a $6,600 loan from the student government, with the expectation that the loan would be paid back over several years from through the student activity fee assessment. The station also received donations of studio equipment from KTOC(AM) in Jonesboro, Louisiana. Throughout the 1970s, the SGA loan was a bone of contention between the station and student government, until it was repaid in 1977 following an increase in the student activity fee. Over the years, the station hosted a variety of fundraisers to support equipment purchases, including several notable radiothons, such as the 54-hour broadcast from atop the Old Bullard Mansion columns in 1982 and the 1987 homecoming weekend-long \\"Stairway to Heaven in '87\\" broadcast from atop Turpin Stadium. The station transmitter and antenna were initially installed atop Russell Library, operating at 10 watts ERP. To improve coverage, the station moved the antenna to an airport beacon tower at Natchitoches Regional Airport in 1978, before relocating to the top of Harry Turpin Stadium in the mid-1980s, which allowed the station to broadcast at its licensed 255 watts ERP. In September 1998, KNWD began streaming its signal online, and in 2014 it began streaming via the TuneIn app. Also since 2014, the station has also broadcast RBDS RadioText. ==Programming== , KNWD programs a mix of \\"alternative and progressive music not appreciated in mainstream media.\\" It also actively promotes local musicians, both through airplay and events. In addition, the station airs student-written news reports and coverage of Northwestern Demons athletics and NSU events. Over its history, KNWD has had a variety of formats from progressive rock to Top 40 to album oriented rock, although for most of its history the station has followed a traditionally eclectic college radio format with a variety of specialty shows and some syndicated programming. The degree to which the station adhered to a more \\"professional\\" format with restricted playlists has also varied over the years. The station also produces themed Spotify playlists for holidays and events.@KNWDradio on Spotify ==Music festivals== KNWD organizes music festivals and concerts on campus featuring local performers, as well as national acts. The station organized its first festival, featuring five local bands, in December 1975; instead of tickets, the station sold KNWD T-shirts for concert-goers to wear. CaddoFest was a fall pep-rally and music festival held in 2013 and 2015 to complement the annual \\"Battle for Chief Caddo\\" football rivalry game against Stephen F. Austin State University. In 2016 and 2017, the station organized Neon Inferno, an EDM and hip-hop festival. DemonFest is a music festival held in the spring by KNWD. It usually holds up to two or more up-and-coming bands as headliners and well- known local bands. KNWD launched the festival in 2000 in part as a reaction to the university booking Toby Keith for an on-campus concert, which the station felt did not reflect the interests of students. In 2007, the station combined DemonFest with the Natchitoches Jazz & R&B; Festival. After a hiatus of several years, DemonFest was restarted by KNWD in 2013. In 2017, weather concerns forced the traditionally outdoor festival into Prather Coliseum. Over the years, the festival has ranged from one day of music to three days. ==Other events== KNWD has organized a number of campus and local events over the years. Notably, on Halloween 1982, the station coordinated the move of the campus ghost, Isabella, from the burned ruins of Caldwell Hall to the oldest building on campus, the Old Women's Gymnasium (now Lee H. Nelson Hall and home to the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training). The event involved more than 750 people, a marching band, and a mounted honor guard. ==References* * * Category:Radio stations in Louisiana Category:College radio stations in Louisiana Category:Radio stations established in 1975 Category:1975 establishments in Louisiana ","title":"KNWD"},{"id":"2221117","text":"Eric Oteyza de Guia (born October 3, 1942 in Baguio, Philippines), better known as Kidlat Tahimik (a Tagalog translation of \\"Lightning Silent\\"), is a film director, writer and actor whose films are commonly associated with the Third Cinema movement through their critiques of neocolonialism. For his contributions to the development of Philippine independent cinema, he was recognized in 2018 as a National Artist of the Philippines for Film - a conferment which represents the Philippine state's highest recognition for artists. One of the most prominent names in the Filipino film industry, he has garnered various accolades locally and internationally, including a Plaridel honorarium for independent cinema. He is dubbed by fellow filmmakers and critics as the \\"Father of Philippine Independent Cinema\\". In recent years, Tahimik has become a noted installation artist with his works exhibited in various public spaces in the Philippines. ==Education== Tahimik attended the University of the Philippines Diliman, where he was elected President of the UP Student Council, then known as the University Student Union, from 1962 to 1963. While attending the university he became a member of the Upsilon Sigma Phi fraternity. Tahimik studied at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, earning a Master in Business Administration. Upon his return, he founded AIESEC in the Philippines. He worked as a researcher for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris from 1968 to 1972. ==Influences== Tahimik grew up in Baguio, Philippines, a summer resort community established in the presence of several U.S. Military bases. This experience influenced the themes of his films, most notably the semi- autobiographical Perfumed Nightmare (1977) and Turumba (1983). The latter of these two films provides some insight into the circumstances that brought him to Europe and into the presence of filmmaker Werner Herzog, who along with director Francis Ford Coppola and his American Zoetrope studio, was instrumental in helping to release Perfumed Nightmare in the United States. ==Personal life== Kidlat lives in a 4-storey home in Benguet, the Philippines, with his wife, German artist and writer Katrin De Guia, and their children Kidlat de Guia (or Kidlat Gottlieb Kalayaan), Kawayan Thor Kalayaan, and Kabunian De Guia (or Kabunian Cedric Enrique). In February 2004, a fire was reported to have spread in their home. The family was able to escape safely, but the director's film stock and collection of art and artifacts were destroyed. He owns the vegetarian cafe Oh My Gulay in Baguio, the Philippines. ==FilmographyDirector=== Feature films *Perfumed Nightmare (1977) *Sinong Lumikha ng Yoyo? Sinong Lumikha ng Moon Buggy?

They share the culture of Luxembourg and speak Luxembourgish. Luxembourgers were, much like Austrians, historically considered to be a regional subgroup of ethnic Germans and viewed themselves as such until the collapse of the German Confederation. Luxembourg became independent, while remaining in personal union with the Netherlands, after the signing of the Treaty of London in 1839.

Most speak Luxembourgish, as their native language, in addition to French and German. Despite the rather small number of Luxembourgers, there is a relatively large diaspora, in Europe and elsewhere. Particularly, there are populations in the surrounding countries of Belgium, France, and Germany. For the most part, this is due to historic reasons, especially the three Partitions of Luxembourg, which led to former territories of Luxembourg being incorporated into each of the three surrounding countries. There are also significant populations in the Americas, with the largest contingent being in the United States.

His style is difficult to classify. ==Biography== Franz Metzner's sculptural figures within the V√∂lkerschlachtdenkmal in Leipzig Metzer learned the craft of stone-cutting in Breslau with Christian Behrens and did apprenticeships in Saxony through 1894. He founded his own studio in Berlin in 1896 and worked predominantly for the royal porcelain factory until 1903, and became a professor at the Vienna college of arts and sciences. Metzner achieved fame by winning a Gold Medal at the Paris Exposition Universelle (1900). Among his important works are the sculptures for Josef Hoffmann's 1904‚Äì1911 landmark Vienna Secession Palais Stoclet in Brussels, including the eccentric four green male nudes at the summit of the building. The Palais Stoclet is an example of \\"Gesamtkunstwerk\\", the integration of art and architecture, one of the goals of Jugendstil, and it had notable influence on birth of Art Deco. In 1910 Metzner met the vacationing Frank Lloyd Wright and, according to the scholarship of Anthony Alofsin, Metzer affected Wright's \\"conventionalization\\" of the human figure and its incorporation into buildings like the Larkin Building and Midway Gardens. Around the same time, Metzner's designs influenced Czech artists working in Prague, Stanislav Sucharda among them. A famous work is the 1913 V√∂lkerschlachtdenkmal (People's Battle Monument), designed by the architect Bruno Schmitz in Leipzig. Metzner executed the powerful and strangely scaled interior figural-architectural sculpture in the \\"Hecker Tomb\\" with his teacher Behrens. The Monument was inaugurated in 1913 by Kaiser Wilhelm II. It is unique and imposing combination of Wilhelmine and Jugendstil styles. Much of Metzner's work in Germany was lost in World War II. ==Other work== * Atlas figures, Zacherl House, Vienna, Austria, 1905, Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik, architect * Tomb for the paper manufacturer Max Krause in the Jerusalem Cemetery in Berlin, 1907, Bruno Schmitz architect * Franz Stelzhammer Monument, Linz, Germany, 1908 * sculpture for the Ufa-Pavillon am Nollendorfplatz in Berlin, 1913, for architect Oskar Kaufmann * Der R√ºdigerbrunnen (the Rudiger well) in the Bavarian city of Kaufbeuren File:Zacherlhaus wanzenburg atlant franz metzner.jpgAtlas figures (1905), Zacherl House, Vienna, Austria, Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik, architect.

Ar√°uz is among the art circles of Enrique T√°bara, An√≠bal Villac√≠s, Jos√© Carre√±o and Juan Villafuerte. In 1957, Ar√°uz began studying under C√©sar Andrade Faini at the School of Fine Arts. During his second year, his father died leaving Ar√°uz feeling nostalgic and isolated. Ar√°uz funneled his emotions into his work creating some of the most beautiful, heartfelt and dreamlike imagery to date. Both his use of color and his compositions are strong and designed to leave a lasting impression on the viewer. Ar√°uz's subjects usually include surreal flower arrangements, the innocence of children, faces, 'trees of life', landscapes and abstracts - all of which are created with a personal dreamlike aesthetic. In 1967, Ar√°uz married Nila Villafuerte Estrada, older sister of Juan Villafuerte. Ar√°uz, Juan Villafuerte and Jos√© Carre√±o had a very close friendship forged at the School of Fine Arts. In the same year, Arauz received a government scholarship to travel to the United States with the fellow master painter Gilberto Almeida a member of the VAN group, an artist collective founded by Enrique T√°bara and An√≠bal Villac√≠s and Jaime Villa in order to study galleries and museums throughout New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Miami. In 1970, arranged through his friend, Jaime Andrade, Ar√°uz exhibited two paintings at the Pan American Union in Washington, D.C. and at Gallery Kromex in New York. Both exhibits were considered notable. In 1971, Ar√°uz obtained The Great Prize of Julio National Hall in Guayaquil. In 1987, Ar√°uz traveled to Basel, Switzerland to exhibit with his friend Elo√≠sa Melo. From there, Ar√°uz traveled to Brussels and exhibited with V√≠ctor Mideros. Finally, Ar√°uz met up with longtime friend and colleague Jose Carre√±o in Paris. Ar√°uz has been a professor at the School of Fine Arts since 1966 and continues to paint in his studio in Guayaquil, Ecuador. ==Awards and medals== 1965 & 1969 Second Prize, National Hall, October, Guayaquil, Ecuador 1963 & 1972 First Prize, National Hall, October, Guayaquil, Ecuador 1968 Great prize, Gold Medal, National Hall, Guayaquil, Ecuador 1971 Great Prize, National Hall, Guayaquil, Ecuador 1975 Second Prize, National Hall, Guayaquil, Ecuador 1981 Gold Medal of Artistic Merit, granted by the illustrious Municipality of Guayaquil. 1996 Gold Brush Cultural Association. ==References== * Municipalidad de Guayaquil - www.guayaquil.gov.ec/data/salondejulio/antecedentes.htm * Salvat, Arte Contempor√°neo de Ecuador.

After 2005, the pageant changed its name to \\"Miss Mexico\\". From 1952 to 1994, was the official pageant responsible for sending the country's representatives to the Miss Universe, Miss World, Miss International and other international pageants. After the crowning of Lupita Jones, as Mexico's first Miss Universe, a dispute between Miss Jones and the pageant organizers over overdued prizes, led to a break of the longtime association between the pageant and the broadcast network Televisa. When the pageant moved to TV Azteca network, a competing pageant called \\"Nuestra Belleza M√©xico\\" was created, later directed by Miss Jones with the sponsorship of Televisa TV Network. In 1994, Se√±orita M√©xico lost the bid to Nuestra Belleza M√©xico to be the official pageant for the Miss Universe pageant. Later Nuestra Belleza M√©xico also obtained the rights of sending Mexico's delegates to Miss World and Miss International. However, the \\"Miss Mexico\\" pageant still sends delegates to other international pageants. The trade name Se√±orita Mexico was trademarked in the United States, by Venezuelan Entrepreneur Adan S. Perez CEO of The Miss Mexico Organization with headquarters in Las Vegas Nevada who produces The Se√±orita Mexico U.S. beauty pageant. He developed a franchise system in every state of The Union to bring girls from all over the United States to compete in the National beauty event, which takes place every year in Las Vegas. Adan Perez has been producing the national competition Se√±orita Mexico U.S in Las Vegas, since 2003. ==Titleholders== Below are the names of the annual titleholders of Se√±orita M√©xico, listed in ascending order, the states they represented during their national crowning or assignment and their final placements in Miss Universe after their participation. ;Color Key { class=\\"sortable\\" border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 0 1em 0 0; background: white; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" -

Set in a new world unrelated to her previous trilogies, the Soldier Son Trilogy follows the life of Nevare Burvelle, the second son of a newly elevated Lord of the Kingdom of Gernia. The career of a person living in Gernia is heavily influenced by their parentage. Those sons born to common parentage follow their father's career. However, for the sons of a noble, things are different. The eldest son inherits his father's title, the second son serves as an officer in the army, the third son enters priesthood, while the fourth becomes an artist. This allocation continues for further sons. Daughters are relegated to submissive roles, being primarily used to forge social links with arranged marriages. The first book, Shaman's Crossing, concerns Nevare's education. As a young boy on the vast plains, his position as the second son, the Soldier Son, is cemented from birth. From an early age, Nevare is drilled in mounted cavalla (Cavalry) techniques, riding, survival, tactics, and all aspects of life as an officer in the King's Cavalla. As a teenager, he has a first encounter with the Specks' magic (see below), which will influence the rest of his life. Later, as a young man, Nevare's education at the King's Cavalla Academy begins. Nevare suffers the consequences of being the son of a New Noble, when the struggle between Old Nobles and New Nobles in the court of Gernia affects the supposedly independent Academy. Book two, Forest Mage, concerns Nevare's trip in disgrace to a town near Gettys, and his time at this farthest outpost in the King's Road construction. His connection with the Specks, a race of tree people who live on after their corporeal lives, develops further. The changes imposed to his body by the Specks' magic he wields, causes rejection and discrimination by most Gernians, including his family. In spite of it, he still pursues his dream of a military career. At the same time, he also tries to save the Specks' ancestors forest from the devastations produced by the Gernian's road advance. The third and final book, Renegade's Magic, details Nevare's sojourn with the Specks in their extensive forest near the Barrier Mountains. His cousin and her husband Spink continue to deal with events in Gettys. Nevare's disjoint personalities are united to realize the initial goal of the magic, in spite of the serious consequences it has on Nevare's life. But balance is finally achieved. ==Historical Themes== The world in which \\"Soldier Son Trilogy\\" is set is a post-colonial one. A civilised and warlike nation, Gernia, has taken to expanding its boundaries inland as a result of its coastal lands being lost to a neighbour's vastly superior naval force. The move inland involves conquering and assimilating native peoples- Plainsmen and Specks. It has been only one or two generations since the Plainsmen have been beaten into submission, and racial and cultural tensions simmer underneath the thin veneer of civilization. But even earlier, the Specks had beaten the fiercest Plainsmen warriors using simply magic. Both Gernians and Specks consider their societies, philosophies, and ways of life the only \\"civilized\\" options. The greater themes of the series so far are: post-colonial backlash, loss of cultural identity, racial preconception and discrimination, and \\"Going Native\\"- a term applied to those of \\"civilized\\" nature who abandon their own culture and adopt the lifestyle of a more \\"savage\\" persuasion. Rigid class and gender stratification and limited opportunities for everybody are consistent with post-colonial times. Explicit magic and shamanism opposes conventional religion and rationalism. ==References== Category:Fantasy novel trilogies ","title":"Soldier Son Trilogy"},{"id":"2221136","text":"FWO may refer to: * Fair Work Ombudsman, an agency of the Government of Australia * Frontier Works Organization, a staff corps of the Pakistan Army * Research Foundation ‚Äì Flanders (FWO), a Dutch-speaking successor to the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research ","title":"FWO"},{"id":"2221141","text":"Electroceramics is a class of ceramic materials used primarily for their electrical properties. While ceramics have traditionally been admired and used for their mechanical, thermal and chemical stability, their unique electrical, optical and magnetic properties have become of increasing importance in many key technologies including communications, energy conversion and storage, electronics and automation. Such materials are now classified under electroceramics, as distinguished from other functional ceramics such as advanced structural ceramics. Historically, developments in the various subclasses of electroceramics have paralleled the growth of new technologies. Examples include: ferroelectrics - high dielectric capacitors, non-volatile memories; ferrites - data and information storage; solid electrolytes - energy storage and conversion; piezoelectrics - sonar; semiconducting oxides - environmental monitoring. Recent advances in these areas are described in the Journal of Electroceramics. ==Dielectric ceramics== Dielectric materials used for construction of ceramic capacitors include: Lead Zirconate titanate (PZT), Barium titanate(BT), strontium titanate (ST), calcium titanate (CT), magnesium titanate (MT), calcium magnesium titanate (CMT), zinc titanate (ZT), lanthanum titanate (LT), and neodymium titanate (NT), barium zirconate (BZ), calcium zirconate (CZ), lead magnesium niobate (PMN), lead zinc niobate (PZN), lithium niobate (LN), barium stannate (BS), calcium stannate (CS), magnesium aluminium silicate, magnesium silicate, barium tantalate, titanium dioxide, niobium oxide, zirconia, silica, sapphire, beryllium oxide, and zirconium tin titanate Some piezoelectric materials can be used as well; the EIA Class 2 dielectrics are based on mixtures rich on barium titanate. In turn, EIA Class 1 dielectrics contain little or no barium titanate. ==Electronically conductive ceramics== Indium tin oxide (ITO), lanthanum-doped strontium titanate (SLT), yttrium-doped strontium titanate (SYT) ==Fast ion conductor ceramics== Yttria- stabilized zirconia (YSZ), gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC), lanthanum strontium gallate magnesite(LSGM), beta alumina, beta\\" alumina ==Piezoelectric and ferroelectric ceramics== Commercially used piezoceramic is primarily lead zirconate titanate (PZT).

He was also the brother of Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr and the nephew of Aisha bint Abu Bakr. His most loved son was Hisham ibn Urwa. He purportedly built a residential complex on some farming land on the outskirts of Medina, some 3km west of Masjid an-Nabawi. ===Uthman's era=== He was born in the early years of the caliphate of UthmanIbn Hajar, Taqrib al-Tahdhib in Medina and lived through the civil war which occurred after Uthman's martyrdom. Although his brother Abd-Allah ibn al-Zubayr wrested the rule from Abd al-Malik, it is unknown if he assisted him. He devoted himself to the study of fiqh and hadith and had the greatest knowledge of hadiths narrated from Aishah. He said, \\"Before Aishah died, I saw that I had become one of four authorities. I said, 'If she dies, there will be no hadith which will be lost from those she knows. I have memorized all of them.\\" ==Legacy== He was one of the seven fuqaha, or jurists, of Medina. ===Works=== Urwah wrote many books, but destroyed them the day of the Battle of al-Harrah. He later had a feeling of regret, saying \\"I would rather have them in my possession than my family and property twice over.\\" At the same time, he quashed any fears that they might become sources of authority alongside the Qur'an. He is also known to have written one of the first writings in the area of the biography of Muhammad, known as the Tract of Seerah. This is not extant either but is known through Ibn Ishaq. Alfred Guillaume writes: [Among precursors of Ibn Ishaq‚Äôs Sira] A man of much greater importance was 'Urwa b. al-Zubayr b. al- 'Awwam (23-94).

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 13, 1997. It was written by Ron Hauge and directed by Dominic Polcino. Bart fraudulently applies for a credit card and uses it to buy an expensive trained dog called Laddie. It guest stars voice actor Frank Welker as Laddie, a parody of Lassie. The episode's title references the novel The Caine Mutiny. ==Plot== When Bart complains he never gets any mail, Marge gives him the family's junk mail. He completes a credit card application under the name of the family dog, Santa's Little Helper. Bart receives a credit card issued to \\"Santos L. Halper\\" after the company misreads his application. He goes on a spending spree, buying the family expensive gifts from a mail-order catalog: smoked salmon and a radio- frying pan for Marge, a golf shirt for Homer, pep pills for Lisa and several things for himself. Undeterred by its US$1,200 price, Bart orders a purebred collie. When the dog arrives, Bart learns his name is Laddie and he is trained to perform several tasks. The Simpsons fall in love with the new dog and neglect Santa's Little Helper. When he fails to pay his credit card bill, Bart gets a call from a debt collection agency demanding payment. When the calls and collection letters persist, he enlists Laddie's help to bury the ill- gotten card. Soon repo men arrive to confiscate his purchases. When a repossessor asks for the $1,200 dog to be returned, Bart identifies Santa's Little Helper as the dog. The greyhound is herded into the truck and he watches sadly as it drives away. Realizing Santa's Little Helper is gone, the family bonds with Laddie, except for Bart, who fears for Santa's Little Helper's fate. When an exhausted Bart takes Laddie on one of his frequent walks, the collie saves the life of Baby Gerald. At the ceremony honoring Laddie's heroism, Chief Wiggum decides that he would make the perfect police dog. Bart gives him to the Springfield police force and breaks down crying while explaining to his family why they no longer have any dog at all. Homer instructs him to find Santa's Little Helper. Bart eventually learns from Reverend Lovejoy that the dog was given to a parishioner, Mr. Mitchell. Bart visits Mitchell to beg for his dog back, but he sees that the man is blind because he fails to notice his parrot has died. When Bart hears how the man and Santa's Little Helper have bonded, he grows heartsick and leaves. Later Bart makes a late-night visit to the man's home and retrieves Santa's Little Helper. While trying to escape, he traps himself in a closet after mistaking it for an outside door. Thinking Bart is a burglar, Mitchell gloats that he has called the police. Bart explains that he is just a child and the dog was originally his. Bart and Mitchell call to Santa's Little Helper so he can decide which owner he prefers. After briefly getting distracted by chasing his own tail, Santa's Little Helper chooses Bart. Chief Wiggum arrives with Laddie, who immediately sniffs out a bag of marijuana in Mitchell's pocket. As Bart and Santa's Little Helper head home, more police officers arrive to enjoy the confiscated cannabis. ==Production== The episode uses the full opening sequence because the story ran short. A long sequence was cut from the middle of the episode, with half of the episode being re-written after the animatic had been finished. The main plot of the episode came from an original idea that the family would be issued a credit card in the name \\"Hobart Simpson\\" which Bart would use. An original subplot was that Lisa would become addicted to \\"Trucker's Choice\\" pep pills. Originally, instead of going to the dog park, the family took Laddie to a waterfall, where he performed a series of dives. This idea was scrapped since the script already proved that Laddie was a form of \\"superdog\\". Likewise, the scene where Laddie rescues Baby Gerald was originally more complicated, but it was cut; the finished episode shows only the aftermath of Laddie's rescue. Laddie was designed to resemble a real dog. The catalog Bart uses is a combination of the Lillian Vernon catalog and The Sharper Image store. The opening stemmed from the fact that the show had not had a sequence where the family received mail, and the writers wanted to create a joke about the different types of mail addressed to each family member. After Bart's \\"dog burning\\" fantasy, when he hears a ship's horn in the distance, there was originally going to be a faint cry of \\"more dogs\\", but it was deemed taking the joke too far. Hank Azaria ad-libbed the entire sequence during the closing credits in which Chief Wiggum and Lou sing along to \\"Jammin'\\". ==Cultural references== The title is a reference to the novel and film The Caine Mutiny. The dog Laddie is a riff on Lassie's name, appearance and uncanny intelligence. Marge listens to the song \\"You Really Got Me\\" by The Kinks on her frying pan radio. At the end of the episode, the song \\"Jamming\\" by Bob Marley is played. The design of the Repo Depot is based very loosely on the repossession agency from Repo Man. The address of Mr. Mitchell's house, 57 Mt. Auburn Street, is one of addresses of The Harvard Lampoon. Mr. Mitchell's belief that his dead parrot is still alive is a reference to the \\"Dead Parrot\\" Monty Python sketch. ==Reception== In its original broadcast, \\"The Canine Mutiny\\" finished 43rd in ratings for the week of April 7‚Äì13, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 8.1, equivalent to approximately 7.9 million viewing households. It was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files, King of the Hill, and Beverly Hills, 90210. The episode's ending with Chief Wiggum and Lou singing along to \\"Jamming'\\" by Bob Marley is often cited as one of the best endings in the history of the show. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \\"A sweet episode\\". Homer's line \\"There, there, shut up boy\\" is one of Josh Weinstein's favorites. ==References *\\"The Canine Mutiny\\" at The Simpsons.com * * * Category:The Simpsons (season 8) episodes Category:1997 American television episodes ","title":"The Canine Mutiny"},{"id":"2221163","text":"List of Moderators of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland is a complete list of Moderators of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland from the Reformation to the present day.

D. Power III (born James David Power on May 30, 1931) is the founder of the marketing firm J.D. Power and Associates. == Early life == Born in Worcester, Massachusetts, he attended Saint Peter's High School. Following graduation from College of the Holy Cross in 1953, Power served four years as a line officer aboard the Coast Guard icebreaker USCGC Eastwind in the Arctic and Antarctic. During his service, he appeared briefly in a Disney documentary ‚ÄúMen Against The Artic‚Äù about icebreakers. He subsequently earned an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Finance. He joined Ford Motor Company as a financial analyst and later worked for Marplan as a marketing research consultant for General Motors Corporation's Buick and GMC truck and coach divisions. Prior to launching J.D. Power and Associates in 1968, Power worked as a marketing research executive for J.I. Case Company, a construction and farm equipment manufacturer, and was director of corporate planning for McCulloch Corporation, a Los Angeles-based engine manufacturer. == J.D. Power and Associates == Power began conducting customer satisfaction research on April 1, 1968 as founder of the marketing information firm J.D. Power and Associates. Initially, the \\"Associates\\" in the firm's title were his own wife and children. In 1972, the company first drew national attention when Julia P. Power, David Power's wife, discovered a design flaw in certain Mazda automobiles, which was then publicized by The Wall Street Journal. In the following years, J. D. Power and Associates became well known for its automotive customer satisfaction rankings. Power sold the company to McGraw- Hill in 2005 for an undisclosed amount of money.

These reactions are examples of cross-coupling reactions. Ullmann-type reactions are comparable to Buchwald‚ÄìHartwig reactions but usually require higher temperatures. Traditionally these reaction requires high-boiling polar solvents such as N-methylpyrrolidone, nitrobenzene, or dimethylformamide and high temperatures (often in excess of 210 ¬∞C) with stoichiometric amounts of copper. Aryl halide were required to be activated by electron-withdrawing groups. Traditional Ullmann style reactions used \\"activated\\" copper powder, e.g. prepared in situ by the reduction of copper sulfate by zinc metal in hot water. The methodology improved with the introduction of soluble copper catalysts supported by diamines and acetylacetonate ligands. ==Ullmann ether synthesis: C-O coupling== Illustrative of the traditional Ullmann ether synthesis is the preparation of p-nitrophenyl phenyl ether from 4-chloronitrobenzene and phenol. :O2NC6H4Cl + HOC6H5 \\\\+ KOH ‚Üí O2NC6H4OC6H5 \\\\+ KCl + H2O Modern arylations use soluble copper catalysts. ==Goldberg reaction: C-N coupling== A traditional Goldberg reaction is illustrated by the synthesis of fenamic acid, an intermediate in the preparation of acridone: Synthesis of fenamic acid Aryl iodides are favored arylating agents. The catalyst used is formed from copper(I) iodide and phenanthroline. As this reaction proceeds well with an electron-rich aryl iodide it is a valuable alternative to the Buchwald‚ÄìHartwig amination reaction, which gives best yields with electron-poor aryl halides. The scope is extended to amides. Buchwald amidation reaction ==Hurtley reaction: C-C coupling== The nucleophile can also be carbon as in a carbanion as well as cyanide. In the traditional Hurtley reaction, the carbon nucleophiles were derived from malonic ester and other dicarbonyl compounds: The Hurtley reaction More modern Cu-catalyzed C-C cross-couplings utilize soluble copper complexes containing phenanthroline ligands. ==C‚ÄìS coupling== The arylation of alkylthiolates proceeds by the intermediacy of cuprous thiolates. ==Mechanism of Ullmann-type reactions== In the case of Ullmann-type reactions (aminations, etherifications, etc. of aryl halides), the reaction involves copper(I) alkoxide, copper(I) amides, copper(I) thiolates. The copper(I) reagent can be generated in situ from the aryl halide and copper metal. Even copper(II) sources are effective. A number of innovations have been developed with regards to copper reagents. These copper(I) compounds subsequently react with the aryl halide in a net metathesis reaction: :Ar-X + ROCu ‚Üí Ar-OR + CuX :Ar-X + RSCu ‚Üí Ar-SR + CuX :Ar-X + 2 RNHCu ‚Üí Ar-NHR + CuX In the case of C-N coupling, kinetic studies implicate oxidative addition reaction followed by reductive elimination from Cu(III) intermediates (Ln = one or more spectator ligands): :ROCuAr(X)Ln ‚Üí RO-Ar + CuLn ==History== The Ullmann ether synthesis or is named after its inventor, Fritz Ullmann. The corresponding Goldberg reaction, is named after Irma Goldberg. The Hurtley reaction, which involves C-C bond formation, is similarly named after its inventor. ==References== Category:Carbon-heteroatom bond forming reactions Category:Condensation reactions Category:Name reactions ","title":"Ullmann condensation"},{"id":"2221187","text":"Fig. 1 A binary phase diagram displaying solid solutions over the full range of relative concentrations. A solid solution is a solid-state solution of one or more solutes in a solvent. Such a multi-component system is considered a solution rather than a compound when the crystal structure of the solvent remains unchanged by addition of the solutes, and when the chemical components remain in a single homogeneous phase. This often happens when the two elements (generally metals) involved are close together on the periodic table; conversely, a chemical compound generally results when two metals involved are not near each other on the periodic table. The solid solution needs to be distinguished from mechanical mixtures of powdered solids like two salts, sugar and salt, etc. The mechanical mixtures have total or partial miscibility gap in solid state. Examples of solid solutions include crystallized salts from their liquid mixture, metal alloys and moist solids. In the case of metal alloys intermetallic compounds occur frequently. ==Details== The solute may incorporate into the solvent crystal lattice substitutionally, by replacing a solvent particle in the lattice, or interstitially, by fitting into the space between solvent particles. Both of these types of solid solution affect the properties of the material by distorting the crystal lattice and disrupting the physical and electrical homogeneity of the solvent material. Some mixtures will readily form solid solutions over a range of concentrations, while other mixtures will not form solid solutions at all. The propensity for any two substances to form a solid solution is a complicated matter involving the chemical, crystallographic, and quantum properties of the substances in question. Substitutional solid solutions, in accordance with the Hume-Rothery rules, may form if the solute and solvent have: * Similar atomic radii (15% or less difference) * Same crystal structure * Similar electronegativities * Similar valency a solid solution mixes with others to form a new solution The phase diagram in Fig. 1 displays an alloy of two metals which forms a solid solution at all relative concentrations of the two species. In this case, the pure phase of each element is of the same crystal structure, and the similar properties of the two elements allow for unbiased substitution through the full range of relative concentrations. Solid solutions have important commercial and industrial applications, as such mixtures often have superior properties to pure materials. Many metal alloys are solid solutions. Even small amounts of solute can affect the electrical and physical properties of the solvent. Fig. 2 This binary phase diagram shows two solid solutions: \\\\alpha and \\\\beta. The binary phase diagram in Fig. 2 shows the phases of a mixture of two substances in varying concentrations, A and B. The region labeled \\"\\\\alpha\\" is a solid solution, with B acting as the solute in a matrix of A. On the other end of the concentration scale, the region labeled \\"\\\\beta\\" is also a solid solution, with A acting as the solute in a matrix of B. The large solid region in between the \\\\alpha and \\\\beta solid solutions, labeled \\"\\\\alpha \\\\+ \\\\beta\\", is not a solid solution. Instead, an examination of the microstructure of a mixture in this range would reveal two phases‚Äîsolid solution A-in-B and solid solution B-in-A would form separate phases, perhaps lamella or grains. ==Application== In the phase diagram, at three different concentrations, the material will be solid until its heated to its melting point, and then (after adding the heat of fusion) become liquid at that same temperature: * the unalloyed extreme left * the unalloyed extreme right * the dip in the center (the eutectic composition). At other proportions, the material will enter a mushy or pasty phase until it warms up to being completely melted. The mixture at the dip point of the diagram is called a eutectic alloy. Lead-tin mixtures formulated at that point (37/63 mixture) are useful when soldering electronic components, particularly if done manually, since the solid phase is quickly entered as the solder cools. In contrast, when lead-tin mixtures were used to solder seams in automobile bodies a pasty state enabled a shape to be formed with a wooden paddle or tool, so a 70-30 lead to tin ratio was used. (Lead is being removed from such applications owing to its toxicity and consequent difficulty in recycling devices and components that include lead.) ==Exsolution== When a solid solution becomes unstable‚Äîdue to a lower temperature, for example‚Äîexsolution occurs and the two phases separate into distinct microscopic to megascopic lamellae. This is mainly caused by difference in cation size. Cations which have a large difference in radii are not likely to readily substitute.Nesse, William D. (2000). Introduction to Mineralogy. New York: Oxford University Press. p91-92. Take the alkali feldspar minerals for example, whose end members are albite, NaAlSi3O8 and microcline, KAlSi3O8. At high temperatures Na+ and K+ readily substitute for each other and so the minerals will form a solid solution, yet at low temperatures albite can only substitute a small amount of K+ and the same applies for Na+ in the microcline. This leads to exsolution where they will separate into two separate phases. In the case of the alkali feldspar minerals, thin white albite layers will alternate between typically pink microcline, resulting in a perthite texture. ==See also== *Solid solution strengthening *Vegard's law ==References== * * ==External links== *DoITPoMS Teaching and Learning Package‚Äî\\"Solid Solutions\\" Category:Materials science Category:Mineralogy ","title":"Solid solution"},{"id":"2221195","text":"The Socialist Party-1 () is a socialist political party in Bolivia. ==History== The Socialist Party-One took part in the 1978, 1979, and 1980 general elections, running Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz and polled 00.43, 04.82 and 08.71 per cent of the vote, respectively.

In the early 1960s, he also recorded as a jazz organist with saxophonists Fred Jackson and Ike Quebec for the Blue Note label. Besides his work as the session keyboardist on Motown hits such as \\"Bernadette\\" by The Four Tops, \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" by Marvin Gaye and \\"Runaway Child, Running Wild\\" by The Temptations, Van Dyke performed with a small band as an opening act for several Motown artists, and released instrumental singles and albums himself. Several of Van Dyke's recordings feature him playing keys over the original instrumental tracks for Motown hits; others are complete covers of Motown songs. His 1967 hit \\"6 by 6\\" is a much-loved stomper on the Northern soul music scene. He was nicknamed \\"Big Funk\\", and \\"Chunk o Funk\\". Van Dyke played the Steinway grand piano, the Hammond B-3 organ, the Wurlitzer electric piano, the Fender Rhodes, and the celeste and harpsichord. He played a toy piano for the introduction of the Temptations' hit, \\"It's Growing\\". His musical influences included Tommy Flanagan, Hank Jones, and Barry Harris.

She is a receptionist for Wernham Hogg paper merchants. Her counterpart in the American version of the show is Pam Beesly. She is also the inspiration for Laetitia Kadiri in the French version of the show, Le Bureau, and Anne Viens in the Qu√©b√©cois version, La Job. Despite her engagement, it is apparent that she is attracted to senior sales representative Tim Canterbury, and he to her. She resigns towards the end of the second series to move with fianc√© Lee to Florida to stay with Lee's sister's family. Her story continues in the Christmas Specials when the documentary producers pay for her and Lee to fly back to the UK to attend the Christmas party and reunion, set three years after the end of series two. She finally leaves Lee for the long- suffering Tim, after he encourages her to hold on to her dream of being a children's book illustrator, an ambition which Lee sought to put down at every opportunity. ==Relationship with Lee== Lee (Joel Beckett) has been Dawn's boyfriend since school, and as of the first series, her fianc√© for three years. Lee proposed through an ad in the paper rather than in person. Dawn comments that she believes he had to pay by the letter, as the ad merely reads \\"Lee love Dawn. Marriage?\\" She sheds positive light on this by commenting that it's rare to find something romantic and thrifty. Lee's relationship with Dawn is constantly problematic, even though she stays with him up until the end of the series. Lee is essentially portrayed as a reasonable man and logical, dependable partner. However he is seen to be sexist and ungrateful towards Dawn; during one episode, he tells his coworkers in the factory that she will \\"take her milkers out for a tenner\\", upsetting both Dawn and Tim. He is also often cold and unsympathetic, and doesn't support Dawn's ambition. In The Quiz, Lee discusses plans for their future, citing that they will get married at a register office to save money and move in with his parents to save on rent. His plans for Dawn include her becoming first a mother, then probably a cleaner. He also apparently lacks a sense of humour, even trumping on a prank perpetrated by Tim on Gareth. It becomes apparent that Lee is also behind Dawn abandoning her dream to become an illustrator. In the second series she reveals that he pushed her to get a full-time job, which meant she was unable to work as an illustrator anymore. In the final episode of the show, his reason for Dawn to abandon being an illustrator becomes clearer, insensitively stating that in order to be an illustrator \\"you got to be good.\\" Dawn seems to stay with Lee out of habit and loyalty, and fear of being lonely. However, in the final episode of the show, Dawn breaks off her engagement to Lee and begins a relationship with Tim Canterbury. ==Relationship with Tim Canterbury== Tim and Dawn are close friends, but obviously have deeper feelings for one another. Tim and Dawn's relationship is also seen to be very flirtatious at times. However, Dawn's engagement to Lee prevents them from becoming more than friends for quite some time. Their friendship seems to suffer after the episode Training, in which Dawn and Lee are having problems. Tim consoles her throughout the episode, but mistakenly comes to the conclusion that Lee and Dawn have split. He then asks Dawn out on a date in front of everyone, where she tells him that she and Lee are still together. Embarrassed, Tim insists he was just asking her out as a friend. During the second series Dawn and Tim remain friends, but don't seem to be as close anymore. Tim starts to take his job more seriously after being promoted and becomes somewhat distant towards Dawn at first. Tim also begins to date Rachel, one of the former Swindon employees, and Dawn grows jealous (along with Gareth, who claims he had feelings for Rachel before Tim and doesn't understand why she wants to go out with someone who looks like a Fisher Price Man). In the fifth episode of the second series, Dawn is selling kisses for Red Nose Day. After Tim makes a contribution, they share a kiss. Tim is then driven to choose between Rachel and Dawn, unaware of Dawn and Lee's plans to move to America. In the next episode he makes his decision, breaking up with Rachel. Tim soon discovers that Dawn is leaving for Florida with Lee. Initially Tim seems reluctant to say anything, but changes his mind during an interview with the camera crew and runs to tell Dawn how he feels. Their conversation is kept private as Tim takes off his microphone, but he emerges unsuccessful and admits Dawn said no. The second series ends with Dawn and Tim depressed. Three years pass, with Tim remaining content in his job at Wernham- Hogg and Dawn existing unhappily with Lee in Florida. When asked if they would fly back to Slough for a Christmas reunion, Dawn hesitates and explains that that would cost \\"three months of wages\\", so the camera crew intervenes by offering to pay for the flight and lodgings. Dawn and Lee are flown back for the reunion, and she briefly resumes her friendship with Tim. When Dawn receives a Christmas present from Tim (some paints with the note 'never give up' written on the sketch that Dawn had drawn for him earlier that day) encouraging her to hold on to her ambition of becoming an illustrator, she leaves Lee and returns to the Christmas party, where she and Tim kiss and finally become a couple.

Born in Boston, he attended Boston Latin School and went on to do his undergraduate studies at Cornell. He subsequently moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to pursue graduate studies at UC Berkeley, first as a Ford Fellow in political science and then at Berkeley's Boalt Hall law school. In the mid-1970s, he founded the private detective agency Palladino & Sutherland with his wife, Sandra Sutherland. Palladino and Sutherland met in 1972 during the course of an undercover investigation into abuses against the inmates of a New York prison on behalf of the Long Island District Attorney. Over a career spanning more than three decades, he has specialized in the preparation for trial of witnesses and evidence in litigation. Palladino is best known for his work in the Peoples Temple tragedy, his defense of car maker John DeLorean, and for the Bill Clinton presidential election committee, the tobacco industry whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand, singer Courtney Love, and musician R. Kelly. He was also a close friend of San Francisco adult-entertainment pioneers Jim and Artie Mitchell, whose O'Farrell Theatre Palladino frequently visited. ==Career== While still in law school (at UC Berkeley), he was hired by the family of Patty Hearst to assist in the matter of her 1974 kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). Palladino spent seven years investigating the Peoples Temple tragedy, in which more than 900 members of a religious cult died in Guyana in 1978. His interviews with surviving members of the cult and their families are now part of the definitive history of that event. In 1982, John DeLorean ‚Äî a former GM executive who had created a struggling independent sports car company ‚Äî was charged with engaging in a cocaine trafficking deal to fund his company. Palladino & Sutherland interviewed more than two hundred witnesses in a defense which convinced the jury to acquit DeLorean based on entrapment by government agents. Palladino is perhaps best known for being hired by the Bill Clinton presidential election committee to challenge a smear campaign intended to deny Clinton the Democratic nomination. Palladino's work included discrediting women with whom Clinton supposedly had been intimate, according to Newsweek magazine. The Clinton election committee reportedly paid Palladino over $100,000 over several years to \\"investigate\\" two dozen women in a \\"damage control inquiry.\\" Michael Isikoff claimed the Clinton campaign used deception regarding the payments. He says the payouts came from campaign funds, but were listed as legal fees paid to a Denver law firm rather than payments to Palladino. He further claimed that Clinton's chief of staff Betsy Wright later told him the funds were for \\"controlling Bimbo eruptions.\\"Isikoff interview on the Charlie Rose show, Thursday, April 8, 1999. Isikoff discusses the Palladino case starting at 4:35 into the interview as published at . The Betsey Wright quote is at 6:20. Palladino also was employed by singer Courtney Love to talk to journalists investigating whether she was involved in the 1994 death of her husband, singer Kurt Cobain. Palladino insists he was never involved in \\"fear and intimidation\\" in his investigations and production of dossiers on such journalists.http://www.sfgate.com/magazine/article/WATCHING- THE-DETECTIVE-3491214.php When former tobacco executive Jeffrey Wigand began cooperating with 60 Minutes on insider revelations of tobacco company manipulations designed to increase smoker addiction, the industry launched a million dollar public relations campaign to discredit him. Palladino engaged in a counter-investigation that turned the spotlight onto this smear campaign and preserved Wigand's credibility as an expert witness in a lawsuit that subsequently resulted in a more than two hundred billion dollar settlement, in the first successful litigation against Big Tobacco. This effort is chronicled in Marie Brenner's May 1996 Vanity Fair article \\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\\" and in the 1999 Michael Mann film The Insider in which Palladino appears as himself,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0657766/ and his partner, Sandra Sutherland, is played by actress Megan Odebash. In 2002, singer, songwriter, and record producer R. Kelly was charged with videotaping himself having sex with an underage teenage girl. An investigation by Palladino that lasted six years culminated in Palladino's testimony at trial challenging the principal prosecution witness, and the acquittal of Kelly in less than a day. In April 2009, Australian businessman Peter Holmes √† Court admitted in the NSW Supreme Court that the Hollywood actor Russell Crowe had hired Palladino & Sutherland to investigate opposition to the planned takeover of the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Crowe had first gotten to know Palladino and his Australian wife and partner, Sandra Sutherland, when all three worked on the film The Insider. Ronan Farrow reported in November 2017 that Harvey Weinstein had, through the lawyer David Boies, employed the private intelligence agencies Kroll, Black Cube and private investigator Jack Palladino to spy on and influence Weinstein's alleged victims as well as reporters who were investigating Weinstein, so as to prevent his conduct from becoming public. Note: Palladino is often confused with Anthony Pellicano, a Los Angeles-based private investigator whose client list is similarly composed of celebrities. == References Further reading== * Fiddling Around (February 28, 1998) * Flowers Feels Vindicated by Report (January 23, 1998) Category:Private detectives and investigators Category:Living people Category:1950s births Category:Lawyers from Boston Category:UC Berkeley School of Law alumni Category:Cornell University alumni ","title":"Jack Palladino"},{"id":"2221240","text":"campaign of 1813, defeated the French at Gro√übeeren and Dennewitz. He also played a prominent part at Waterloo in 1815. Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B√ºlow, Graf von Dennewitz (16 February 175525 February 1816) was a Prussian general of the Napoleonic Wars. ==Early life== B√ºlow was born in Falkenberg, in the Altmark, and was the elder brother of Freiherr Dietrich Heinrich von B√ºlow. A member of the noble B√ºlow family he received an excellent education, and entered the Prussian army in 1768, becoming ensign in 1772, and second lieutenant in 1775. He took part in the Potato War of 1778, and subsequently devoted himself to the study of his profession and of the sciences and arts. Throughout his life B√ºlow was devoted to music, his great musical ability bringing him to the notice of King Frederick William II of Prussia, and c. 1790 he was conspicuous in the most fashionable circles of Berlin. He did not, however, neglect his military studies, and in 1792 he was made military instructor to the young Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia, becoming at the same time full captain. He took part in the campaigns of 1792-94 on the Rhine, and received for signal courage during the siege of Mainz the order Pour le M√©rite and promotion to the rank of major. Statue of von B√ºlow, on the Unter den Linden, Berlin. After this B√ºlow went to garrison duty at Soldau. In 1802 he married the daughter of Colonel von Auer, and in the following year he became lieutenant-colonel, remaining at Soldau with his corps. The vagaries and misfortunes of his brother Dietrich affected his happiness as well as his fortune. The loss of two of his children was followed in 1806 by the death of his wife, and a further source of disappointment was the exclusion of his regiment from the field army sent against Napoleon in 1806. The disasters of the campaign aroused his energies. He did excellent service under Anton Wilhelm von L'Estocq's command in the latter part of the war, was wounded in action, and finally designated for a brigade command in Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher's force. In 1808 B√ºlow married the sister of his first wife, a girl of eighteen. He was made a major-general in the same year, and henceforward he devoted himself wholly to the regeneration of Prussia. The intensity of his patriotism threw him into conflict even with Bl√ºcher and led to his temporary retirement; in 1811, however, he was again employed. == War of the Sixth Coalition== B√ºlow memorial in Dennewitz Arms of Count B√ºlow von Dennewitz, 1814 In the critical days preceding the War of the Sixth Coalition, B√ºlow kept his troops in hand without committing himself to any irrevocable step until the decision was made. On 14 March 1813 he was made a lieutenant- general. He fought against Oudinot in defence of Berlin, and in the summer came under the command of Bernadotte, crown prince of Sweden. At the head of an army corps B√ºlow distinguished himself greatly in the Battle of Grossbeeren, a victory which was attributed almost entirely to his leadership. A little later he won the great victory at the Battle of Dennewitz, which for the second time checked Napoleon's advance on Berlin. This inspired the greatest enthusiasm in Prussia, as being won by mainly Prussian forces, and rendered B√ºlow's popularity almost equal to that of Bl√ºcher. For his superb generalship and courage during the Battle of Grossbeeren von B√ºlow was awarded the Grand Cross of the Swedish Order of the Sword on the battlefield by crown prince Charles John of Sweden and was subsequently ennobled as Graf von Dennewitz by the King of Prussia.Barton, Pp. 91-94. B√ºlow's corps played a conspicuous part in the final overthrow of Napoleon at Leipzig, and he was then entrusted with the task of evicting the French from Holland and Belgium. In an almost uniformly successful campaign he won a signal victory at Hoogstraten although he was fortunate to be supported, often very significantly, by the British General Thomas Graham, second in command to Lord Wellington. In the campaign of 1814 he invaded France from the north-west, joined Bl√ºcher, and took part in the brilliant victory of Laon in March. He was made general of infantry and received the title of Count B√ºlow von Dennewitz. He also took part in the Allied sovereigns' visit to England in June 1814. ==Waterloo Campaign== In the short peace of 1814-1815 B√ºlow was at K√∂nigsberg as commander-in-chief in Prussia proper. He was soon called to the field again, and in the Waterloo Campaign commanded the IV Corps of Bl√ºcher's army. He was not present at Ligny, but his corps headed the flank attack upon Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo, and bore the heaviest part in the fighting of the Prussian troops around Plancenoit. He took part in the invasion of France, but died suddenly on 25 February 1816, a month after his return to the K√∂nigsberg command. ==NotesReferences== * * * ==External links== Category:1755 births Category:1816 deaths Category:People from Stendal (district) Category:People from the Margraviate of Brandenburg Friedrich Wilhelm Category:Barons of Germany Category:Generals of Infantry (Prussia) Category:Prussian commanders of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Recipients of the Pour le M√©rite (military class) Category:Recipients of the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross Category:Commanders Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa Category:Recipients of the Order of St. George of the Second Degree Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Military Order of William ","title":"Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B√ºlow"},{"id":"2221247","text":"Phi Kappa may refer to: *Phi Kappa Literary Society, a debate society founded in 1820 at the University of Georgia *Phi Kappa (secondary), a secondary school fraternity founded in 1900 *Phi Kappa (Catholic fraternity), a higher education fraternity founded in 1889 and one of the two fraternities that merged to form Phi Kappa Theta ","title":"Phi Kappa"},{"id":"2221250","text":"The Austrian Parliament () is the bicameral federal legislature of the Austrian Republic.

The legislative period lasts five years, elections are held earlier if the National Council prematurely moves for its own dissolution. The National Council is the dominant (albeit 'lower') house in the Austrian Parliament, and consequently the terms Parliament and National Council are commonly used synonymously. The Federal Council is elected indirectly, through the provincial assemblies (Landtage) of the nine States of the Federal Republic, and reflects the distribution of seats in the Austrian Landtage. The states are represented in the Federal Council roughly in accordance to the size of their populations. Seats are redistributed among the states following each general census, and the overall size of the chamber varies slightly as a result. The current Federal Council is composed of 61 delegates. With regard to most issues, the Federal Council only possesses a dilatory right of veto which can be overridden by the National Council. However, the Federal Council enjoys absolute veto powers over bills intended to alter the powers of either the states, or of the Federal Council itself. The Federal Assembly (Bundesversammlung) is a body whose function is mostly ceremonial in nature, and consists of the members of both houses of Parliament. The Federal Assembly convenes only rarely, for instance to witness the inauguration of the Federal President. It might be noted, however, that under exceptional circumstances the Austrian constitution endows the Federal Assembly with significant responsibilities. An example of this would be its pivotal role in the hypothetical impeachment of a Federal President. Both houses of Parliament, as well as the Federal Assembly, convene in the Parliament building located on Vienna's Ringstra√üe. From 2017 to 2020 they convene in the Redoute Wing of the Hofburg due to a reconstruction of the Parliament building. ==See also== * Constitution of Austria * Austrian Parliament Building * Imperial Council (Austria), the legislature between 1861 and 1918 * Imperial Diet (Austria), 1848‚Äì1849 ==External links== *The Austrian Parliament - Official Homepage Category:Bicameral legislatures Category:National legislatures Category:Parliaments by country Parliament ","title":"Austrian Parliament"},{"id":"2221251","text":"\\"Love Makes the World Go 'Round\\" is a popular music song written by Ollie Jones.

Both independent and government-run grant-funding agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the World Health Organization (WHO), require data and safety monitoring protocols for Phase I and II clinical trials conforming to their standards. ==Safety monitoring== Safety monitoring of a clinical trial is conducted by an independent physician with relevant expertise. This is accomplished by review of adverse event, immediately after they occur, with timely follow-up through resolution.Ariel E. Quinio, Safety in Clinical Trials: Who is Responsible? International Biopharmaceutical Association:IBPA Publications , 2005 Responsibility for data and safety monitoring depends on the phase of the study and may be conducted by sponsor or Contract research organization (CRO) staff or contractor, and/or by the Principal clinical investigator/project manager conducting the study. Regardless of the method used, monitoring must be performed on a regular basis. Oversight of the monitoring activity is the responsibility of the sponsor. == Aspects of monitoring == According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Center of Drug Evaluation and Research, the top five deficiency categories for site inspections caught by clinical monitors as reported in the 2001 Report to the Nation are: *Failure to follow investigation protocol (the procedures and treatment subjects must undergo, as well as the schedule of assessments) *Failure to keep adequate and accurate records *Problems with the informed consent form *Failure to report adverse events *Failure to account for the disposition of study drugs Therefore, the primary goal of clinical trial monitoring is to observe each trial site to ensure that the standardized operation procedures for the trial are being followed, reporting and managing any deviations from the investigation plan as they occur. Monitoring plans in the United States typically also require a clear protocol for reporting adverse/undesirable effects caused by the treatment to the institutional review board (IRB), the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA), and the institution funding the research. The FDA itself maintains an Adverse Event Reporting System for such occurrences in clinical trials it oversees in the United States. == Functions of the clinical monitor == Clinical monitors execute the monitoring plan laid out by the sponsors and investigators of a clinical trial. Monitors may be referred to by many different titles, such as: Clinical Research Associate, \\"on-site\\" monitor, Clinical Research Monitor, Study Site Monitor and Quality Specialist. The number of clinical monitors depends on the scale and scope of the trial. Almost all field monitoring requires regular visits to the site by the clinical research associate throughout the period of the study. On occasion, an extremely simple, low-risk study might be monitored almost exclusively by telephone except for the startup and closeout visits. Since the concept of \\"low risk\\" is subjective, this definition should be established in internal policies and procedures. == Complexity of monitoring == The level of scrutiny of monitoring varies across studies based on risks and nature of the trial. Considerations that affect the design of monitoring plans usually include: *Complexity of the protocol (including toxicity, presence of special populations inside sample groups, amount of interaction needed, length of treatment, etc.) *Risk of the treatment *Disease being evaluated *Number of study subjects enrolled at the site *Number of treatment sites (such as number of clinics with access to and assigning the treatment) *Site performance *Sponsor monitoring standard operating protocols Several of these factors depend on the phase of the clinical trial--for example, in some early Phase I studies of drugs whose effects on different individuals are unknown, the monitor may be required to be present during all or part of a subject's treatment, while Phase II investigations usually involve multiple investigation sites. The overall monitoring plan should remain fairly consistent, but the strategy for individual sites may change considerably during the course of the study depending on study conditions and site performance. == See also == *Clinical trials *Data monitoring committee *Drug development *European Medicines Agency *Safety monitoring *U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) *Serious adverse event (SAE) == References Bibliography== * Carol Rados, Inside Clinical Trials Testing Medical Products in People FDA Consumer magazine, September‚ÄìOctober 2003 Issue == External links == *ICH Website: Guidelines for Clinical Trial Monitoring *FDA Website *ClinicalTrials.gov from US National Library of Medicine Category:Clinical research Category:Medical monitoring Category:Pharmaceutical industry ","title":"Monitoring in clinical trials"},{"id":"2221253","text":"The Azadi Stadium ( varzeshgƒÅh-e ƒÅzƒÅdi), opened as the Aryamehr Stadium ( varzeshgƒÅh-e ƒÅryƒÅmehr), is an all-seater football stadium in Tehran, Iran. The stadium was designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, an American architectural, urban planning, and engineering firm. It was inaugurated on 18 October 1971 by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran; it is currently self-owned by Esteghlal and Persepolis. It is also the home stadium of the Iran national football team. It has a capacity of 78,116 spectators, as the result of conversion to all-seater stadium. The stadium is part of the much larger Azadi Sport Complex, and is surrounded by a rowing river, football training pitches, a weightlifting complex, swimming facilities and indoor volleyball and futsal courts, among many other amenities. Aryamehr (meaning \\"Light of the Aryans\\") was the title of the said Shah; it was renamed after the Iranian Revolution to Azadi (meaning \\"freedom\\" in Persian). It is the largest association football stadium in Western Asia. It was built to host the 1974 Asian Games and has hosted the 1976 AFC Asian Cup. The stadium also hosted five finals of Asian Club Competitions: three finals of AFC Champions League in 1999, 2002 and 2018 and two finals of Asian Cup Winners' Cup in 1991 and 1993. Azadi Stadium also hosted WAFF Championship Tournament in 2004 and 2008. Because of the loud sound of a vuvuzels, similar to the sound of bees, the stadium is sometimes called a \\"Bee swarm\\".bugaga.ru ‚Äî 25 —Å–∞–º—ã—Ö –ø—É–≥–∞—é—â–∏—Ö —Å—Ç–∞–¥–∏–æ–Ω–æ–≤ –≤ –º–∏—Ä–µ (25 Most intimidating stadiums in the world) In Russian ==Location== The stadium is located in the West of Tehran, near Ekbatan district, and is easily accessible for most people living in the city. The stadium has two entrances. The West entrance is located on Ferdous street and the East entrance is on Farhangian street. ==History== VIP fa√ßade of the stadium The Azadi Stadium was constructed by Arme Construction Company and designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill for the 1974 Asian Games with international criteria. Its land measurement is 450 Hectares and it is located in West Tehran. It replaced the Amjadieh Stadium as the new home of Iran's national football team. The stadium was built as part of a much larger complex which included numerous Olympic- sized venues for various sports, laying the groundwork for ambitious plans for Tehran to make a bid to host the Summer Olympics. In August 1975, the Iranian Shah, Tehran's Mayor and the Iranian Olympic Committee submitted a formal letter to the International Olympic Committee, notifying it of Iran's interest in hosting the 1984 Summer Games.http://library.la84.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1975/ore95/ore95zb.pdf The stadium was the focal point for the bid, in which it would have only required slight modifications to become the main Olympic Stadium. But political unrest in the late-1970s saw Tehran drop its bid for Games, leaving the eventual host, Los Angeles, the only city left bidding. Renovations first began on the stadium in 2002, when the lower level had seats installed and the pitch was replanted along with the installation of an underground heating system. Stadium management also planned to later install seats in the upper level of the stadium. Those renovations were completed in 2003, and brought down the capacity of the stadium to well under 100,000. Later upgrades to the stadium brought it down to its current capacity of 78,116. Despite its reduced capacity, Azadi Stadium has been filled over capacity at times such as the Iran-Japan World Cup 2006 qualification match in March 2005 which resulted in the deaths of seven people. In 2004 a large jumbotron television was added, replacing the original scoreboard. This giant screen with a total area of about 300 square meters and screen area of 104 square meters (20 m by 7.5 m) is one of the biggest in the world. The stadium hosted two West Asian Football Federation Championship in 2004 and 2008. In 2008, AFC forced Sepahan to play the home matches in AFC Champions League in this stadium after their home stadium Naghsh-e-Jahan Stadium was closed for renovation. The stadium also is the regular host for Iran U-23 for the Olympics football qualifying. In recent years the Iranian Football Federation has repeatedly submitted bids to host the AFC Asian Cup, which Iran last hosted in 1976. But some officials have hinted that rules in Iran banning women from stadiums like Azadi have kept international sports organizations from staging events there. Iranian women have been banned from watching matches at Azadi Stadium since 1982. The ban on women spectators was lifted for an October 2019 match between the Iranian and Cambodian National Teams. ==Events== *In November 1975, Frank Sinatra held a concert at Aryamehr Stadium. *The famous 2006 film, \\"Offside\\" (the winner of the Silver bear at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2006) directed by Jafar Panahi and starring Sima Mobarak Shahi and Ida Sadeghi, about girls trying to get into the stadium to watch a football match, was filmed there. *Azadi Stadium also hosted Ferdousi festival, organized by Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organization and two major concerts in May 2013. * 2015 Women's Islamic Games were also held at the stadium. ==Building and facilities== The architect of the stadium were Abdolaziz Farmanfarmaian and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. At the beginning, the stadium had a maximum capacity of 120,000 visitors but was decreased to 84,000 after renovations in 2003. On the big occasions the crowd swells well beyond that. The design of the stadium amplifies the noise across the pitch. Opposing teams often find it difficult to play their best game, when the stadium is full, as the noise level becomes very high. According to Goal.com, Azadi Stadium was voted most intimidating in Asia. The structural engineer and project manager for the building of the stadium was James Raymond Whittle from England. ==Transportation== There is enough parking for 400 cars inside the stadium, and an additional 10,000 parking spots are available outside. The nearest metro station is the Varzeshgah-e Azadi Metro Station. ==Record attendance== The record attendance at Azadi Stadium is over 128,000 during a 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Australia. ==Gallery== File:Azadi Stadium Site Plan.jpgStadium site plan File:1974 Asian Game inauguration.jpgThe official inauguration of 1974 Asian Games File:Persepolis FC vs Kashima Antlers 10 November 2018 14.jpgAzadi Stadium during 2018 AFC Champions League Final File:ACL 2018 Final 8.jpgAzadi Stadium during 2018 AFC Champions League Final File:Tehranderby76.jpgPanoramic view from the Azadi Stadium ==See also== *List of association football stadia by capacity *Football in Iran *Azadi Sport Complex *Azadi Tower ==References *Official website of the Azadi Sports Complex Stadium Stadium Category:Sports venues in Tehran Category:Football venues in Iran Category:AFC Asian Cup stadiums Iran Category:Stadiums of the Asian Games Category:Sports venues completed in 1973 Category:Abdol Aziz Farmanfarmaian buildings ","title":"Azadi Stadium"},{"id":"2221258","text":"Anichini is a quite common Florentine surname from Annichini di Bongarden, Deutch \\"Freelance Mercenary\\" in 1300, and may refer to: *Assunta Anichini, Florentine children's clothing tailored brand *Luigi Anichini, Ferrara engraver *Cezary Anichini (1787-1861), Polish-Italian architect Category:Italian-language surnames ","title":"Anichini"},{"id":"2221261","text":"Staphylococcus caprae is a Gram-positive, coccus bacteria and a member of the genus Staphylococcus.

Animation which aired from 1995 to 2000 on Kids' WB. The final episode, containing the segments \\"The Tail End?\\" and \\"This Is the End\\", never aired on Kids' WB, and remained unaired until December 13, 2002, when the show aired in reruns on Cartoon Network. 52 episodes were produced. ==Plot== The show follows Looney Tunes characters Sylvester and Tweety, and their owner Granny, along with bulldog Hector (Mr Bees) (who appeared in several cartoons alongside Tweety, Sylvester and Granny but was in the series given a new design similar to that of Marc Antony), as they solved mysteries, even with Sylvester still trying to eat Tweety in the middle of solving the mysteries, but Hector acted as a bodyguard for Tweety, and would even beat Sylvester up (usually out of shot, but sometimes behind a blind). The first season was dedicated to the memory of Friz Freleng, Warner Bros. animator and the original creator of the Sylvester and Tweety pairing. Freleng had died of natural causes at age 88 only months before the series premiere. Originally, the series during the first season consisted one case per episode, meaning a full-length story. Starting with the second season, the series now consists of two 11-minute stories, meaning two cases per half-hour. Other Looney Tunes characters make cameo appearances, including Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, Elmer Fudd, the Tasmanian Devil, Pep√© Le Pew, Beaky Buzzard, Babbit and Catstello, Hubie and Bertie, Foghorn Leghorn, Witch Hazel, Michigan J.

Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig and Wile E. Coyote do not appear in this series. However, Colonel Rimfire, Cool Cat's nemesis, did appear in the series. The final episode of the series never aired on Kids' WB (in which, after decades of trying, Sylvester finally succeeded in eating Tweety, but it turns out to be a dream), but did air on Cartoon Network in 2002. ==EpisodesCharacters== *Sylvester (voiced by Joe Alaskey) ‚Äì Sylvester acts as narrator throughout the episodes, and continually tries to devour Tweety for his supper, though he is always thwarted by Hector or Tweety's craftiness. Despite their never-ending feud, the pair manage to get along for the most part, and Sylvester will defend Tweety when someone else tries to harm the canary. Sylvester also unwittingly discovers many clues, claiming as the narrator to have knowledge of the case (though this is probably bluster). Besides chasing Tweety, Sylvester often explores the surroundings, leading him to sometimes be in awkward situations (i.e. being chased by a male cousin of Pepe Le Pew, Pitu Le Pew or using Granny's umbrella to pierce a villain's blimp). Through these situations, the baritone and tenor singing, lisping Tuxedo cat endures all manner of pain and suffering, but comes out none the worse for wear. Sylvester is allergic to wool and is jealous of Tweety. *Tweety (voiced by Joe Alaskey) ‚Äì A cute but sadistic yellow canary. Tweety is often trying to escape Sylvester by foiling him through either his flying, clever timing, or his bodyguard, Hector. Tweety usually stays with Granny and is responsible for some major clues. Despite his feud with Sylvester, the pair will team up if Granny is threatened and can work together very well. Tweety also serves as a source of ironic humor at times, usually in reference to Sylvester's foiled attempts to eat him. The show also harks back to Tweety's earlier shorts by Bob Clampett (in fact, Tweety meets his old self in the episode Seeing Double, depicted as a separate character called Orson, Tweety's prototype) and he is not above malice towards \\"dat bad old putty tat\\". *Granny (voiced by June Foray) ‚Äì A practical old fashioned world-renowned detective, Granny travels the globe with Sylvester and Tweety, attending events such as races or canary contest and is often called upon by the locals to solve a crime. However, there have been attempts to frame Granny, causing some difficulty in finding clues. She is overprotective of Tweety, and will not hesitate to give Sylvester a good whack on the head. She sometimes calls upon the cat to investigate clues or defend the group while they sleep, though, showing signs of obvious trust. Granny is good natured mostly, but can become stern. With Granny as the main detective of the show, she bears similarity to Miss Marple. *Hector (Mr Bees) (voiced by Frank Welker) ‚Äì Granny's pet bulldog and Tweety's bodyguard. Hector keeps Sylvester from eating the canary and will often beat him up if he gets in his way. Hector will defend Granny, Tweety or even Sylvester if threatened, but is not above stealing food or trying to please others. ==Home media== On September 9, 2008, Warner Home Video released The Complete First Season of The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries on DVD in Region 1.

The fate of the vessel was a mystery until its wreck was positively identified in 2016. == Construction == The tug was built for the Philadelphia and Reading Railway as the Conestoga in 1904 by Maryland Steel Company, Sparrows Point, Maryland. She was purchased on 14 September 1917 for the World War I duty and designated SP-1128. She was commissioned on 10 November 1917, Lieutenant (junior grade) C. Olsen, USNRF, in command. ==Service history== Conestogas crew in 1921. Assigned to the Submarine Force, Conestoga carried out towing duties along the Atlantic coast, transported supplies and guns, escorted convoys to Bermuda and the Azores, and cruised with the American Patrol Detachment in the vicinity of the Azores. At the end of the war she was attached to Naval Base No. 13, Azores, from which she towed disabled ships and escorted convoys until her arrival at New York on 26 September 1919. She was then assigned to harbor tug duty in the 5th Naval District at Norfolk, Virginia. Conestoga (which had received the hull number AT-54 in July 1920) went to the Pacific in late 1920. She was at San Diego, California and Mare Island, California, during the first three months of 1921. On 25 March of that year the tug steamed out of Mare Island, with a barge of coal sailing via Pearl Harbor to take up an assignment as station ship at Tutuila, American Samoa. Commanded by Lt. Ernest Larkin Jones, Conestoga was not heard from again. Despite an extensive search, the only trace found of her at the time of her loss was a lifeboat bearing the initial letter of her name found near Manzanillo, Mexico. ==Rediscovery== Stern view of the shipwreck, colonized with sea anemones. Her wreck was discovered in 2009, as an unidentified shipwreck in the Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, a few miles from Southeast Farallon Island, just off the San Francisco, California coast. In October 2015, a joint NOAA and Navy mission confirmed the wreck was the Conestoga and on 23 March 2016, 95 years after the ship was lost, a formal announcement was made. The shipwreck was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== *history.navy.mil: USS Conestoga Photos * * Roll of Honor Category:1904 ships Category:Tugs of the United States Navy Category:Ships built in Sparrows Point, Maryland Category:Maritime incidents in 1921 Category:Shipwrecks of the California coast Category:Ships lost with all hands Category:History of the San Francisco Bay Area Category:2016 in California Category:1921 in California Category:National Register of Historic Places in San Francisco Category:Shipwrecks on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:Reading Company ","title":"USS Conestoga (AT-54)"},{"id":"2221294","text":"Hazcam image of Botany Bay and Solander Point (2013) Opportunity rover was stuck in a sand dune.

As an advisor to Meiji period Japan, his liberal political views influenced the wording of the Constitution of the Empire of Japan as well as major constitutional thinkers such as Rudolf von Gneist. According to Colin Gordon, Stein articulated a \\"vision of a liberal state as active historic partner in the making of civil society\\" and called for \\"a tabling of the question of class formation as part of the state's agenda.\\" Stein advocated a combination of constitutional liberal state with a welfare state, and has been called the \\"intellectual father of the welfare state. Stein and other Hegelian liberals, such as Robert von Mohl, also had a profound influence on American progressivism. == Biography == Stein was born in the seaside town of Borby in Eckernf√∂rde in Schleswig-Holstein as Wasmer Jacob Lorentz. He studied philosophy and jurisprudence at the universities of Kiel and Jena from 1835‚Äì1839, and at the University of Paris from 1841‚Äì1842. Between 1846 and 1851 Stein was an associate professor at the University of Kiel. He participated in the 1848 Revolutions and ran for election as a member of the Frankfurt Parliament. His advocacy of independence for his native Schleswig, then part of Denmark, led to his dismissal in 1852. In 1848, Stein published a book entitled Socialist and Communist Movements since the Third French Revolution (1848) in which he introduced the term \\"social movement\\" into scholarly discussions‚Äîdepicting actually in this way political movements fighting for the social rights understood as the welfare rights. This theme was repeated in 1850, when Stein published a book titled History of the French Social Movements from 1789 to the Present (1850). For Stein, the social movement was basically understood as a movement from society to the state, created by the inequalities in the economy, making the proletariat part of politics through representation. The book was translated into the English by Kaethe Mengelberg and published by Bedminster Press in 1964 (Cahman, 1966) From 1855, until his retirement in 1885, von Stein was a professor of Political economy at the University of Vienna. His work from that period is considered as the basis of the international science of public administration. He also influenced the practice of public finance. In 1882, Japanese Prime Minister of Japan It≈ç Hirobumi headed a delegation to Europe to study western governmental systems. The delegation went first to Berlin, where they were instructed by Rudolf von Gneist, and then Vienna, where Stein was lecturing at the University of Vienna. As with Gneist, Stein's message to the Japanese delegation was that universal suffrage and party politics should be avoided. Stein held that the state was above society, and that the purpose of the state was to bring about social reform, which was implemented from the monarchy down to the common people. However, Stein is best known for the fact that he applied Hegel's dialectic to the area of public administration and the national economy, in order to improve the systematics of these sciences, although he did not neglect the historical aspects. Stein analyzed the class state of his time and compared it with the welfare state. He outlined an economic interpretation of history that included concepts of the proletariat and of class struggle, but he shared the fear of violent revolution common among middle-class liberals and advocated reformist solutions instead. He gave emphasis to the \\"Social Question\\" that the industrial worker in a capitalist country has no chance to acquire property and capital by work, which was to be addressed by a program of welfare state and social administration arranged according to the liberal principle of free and equal individual chances. Despite a similarity of his ideas with those of Marxism, the extent of Stein's influence on Karl Marx is uncertain. However, Marx shows by scattered remarks on von Stein that he was aware of his highly influential book from 1842 on communist thought in France. For instance in The German Ideology (1845‚Äì46), Stein is mentioned, but only as the writer of his 1842 book. Stein died at his home in Hadersdorf-Weidlingau in the Penzing District of Vienna and was buried at the Matzleinsdorf Protestant Cemetery. == Books == * Der Sozialismus und Kommunismus des heutigen Frankreich, Leipzig 1842, second edition, 1847. * Die sozialistischen und kommunistischen Bewegungen seit der dritten franz√∂sischen Revolution, Stuttgart, 1848. * Geschichte der sozialen Bewegung in Frankreich von 1789 bis auf unsere Tage, Leipzig, 1850, 3 volumes. * Geschichte des franz√∂sischen Strafrechts, Basel, 1847. * Franz√∂sische Staats- und Rechtsgeschichte, Basel, 1846- 1848, 3 volumes. * System der Staatswissenschaft, Volume 1: Statistik, Basel, 1852; Volume 2: Gesellschaftslehre, Basel, 1857. * Die neue Gestaltung der Geld- und Kreditverh√§ltnisse in √ñsterreichkl√±jo , Vienna, 1855. * Lehrbuch der Volkswirtschaft, Vienna, 1858; third edition as Lehrbuch der National√∂konomie, third edition,1887. * Lehrbuch der Finanzwissenschaft, Leipzig, 1860; fifth edition, 1885 - 1886, 4 volumes. * Die Lehre vom Heerwesen, Stuttgart, 1872. * Verwaltungslehre, Stuttgart, 1865- 1884, 8 volumes. * Handbuch der Verwaltungslehre, Stuttgart, 1870; third edition, 1889, 3 volumes. == References Further reading== * Werner J.

This was an ancient area of heathland and latterly the site of Martlesham Heath Airfield. A \\"new village\\" was established there in the mid-1970s and this has developed into a modern community, based on a traditional village pattern. The population is still included in that of Martlesham. ==History== There is evidence of settlement in this area since the Bronze Age, with a number of round barrows surviving to the present.the antiquity of amn in east anglia. CUP Archive. pp. 152‚Äì. GGKEY:383DGLH0WR8. The main community of Martlesham grew up to the north-east, initially on the highest ground, where Martlesham Church is still located, then, later, centring on the point where the main London-to-Yarmouth road crosses the River Finn, a tributary to the Deben. White's 1844 directory of Suffolk describes Martlesham as \\"a neat village near the confluence of a rivulet with the Deben\\" but mentions that the parish includes \\"a large, sandy, and unenclosed heath, extending about 2 miles S.W., and affording pasturage for numerous herds of sheep and cattle.\\" Up until 2013, the village held an annual festival, 'Village Day' latterly known as 'Music on the Green'. This event attracted hundreds of people each June with attractions such as live music fairground rides and Llama Jousting. ==Martlesham Heath Airfield== In 1917, the Experimental Aircraft Flight of the Central Flying School was transferred from Upavon, Wiltshire to a site on the heathland at Martlesham and, on 16 January 1917, Martlesham Heath Airfield was officially opened, as an experimental airfield. The unit was renamed the \\"Aeroplane Experimental Unit, Royal Flying Corps\\". After the end of World War I the site continued to be used and was, once again, renamed as the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE) of the Royal Air Force. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the A&AEE was removed to a site at Boscombe Down, Wiltshire, owing to the proximity of Martlesham Heath to the East Coast and its vulnerability to enemy attack. The airfield then took on a new role as a base for fighter squadrons defending Britain. Wing Commander (later Group Captain) Douglas Bader, D.S.O., D.F.C. served at Martlesham Heath with 222 and 242 Squadrons, in 1940. At the end of hostilities, there was no longer a role for Martlesham Heath as an operational RAF airfield and no prospect of the A&AEE returning, but the site was again used for a number of experiments with planes and armaments. However, its use declined in the 1950s, and the airfield was closed in the early 1960s. Various proposals were put forward for the development of the site, including the proposal that it should become a civil airport. Parts of the old airfield were let out to light industry and storage companies. In 1963 the lease of the site was sold by the Air Ministry to Bradford Property Trust Ltd, for a price of ¬£72,500. ==Adastral Park== In 1968, the Post Office purchased part of the airfield and surrounding farmland and announced that they would be relocating their Research Department from Dollis Hill to a new centre to be built at Martlesham Heath. The building work took place in the early 1970s and this site has remained as the central research and development facility through the changes that have taken place with the separation of British Telecom from the Post Office and the privatisation of British Telecommunications. In the 1980s, the facility was renamed as BT Labs and was subsequently developed into a high tech business park called Adastral Park in the 1990s. ==New village== In 1972 a proposal was presented by Bradford Property Trust to the Planning Department of the local council to develop a \\"New Village\\" of Martlesham Heath, with houses for 3000 people, with associated shops, schools and recreational facilities. This was accepted and has resulted in the development of the present community of Martlesham Heath. The vision of this development was to create a completely new community, but based on a traditional pattern. Hence, the village is centred on a village green, with a pub, church and cricket pavilion. In order to maintain a consistent appearance as a village, homeowners at Martlesham Heath are restricted by covenants which govern changes that they can make to their houses and gardens: for example, residents are prevented from attaching external television aerials to their houses. However, many have erected satellite TV dishes, since these were not foreseen when the covenants were written and are therefore allowed. A cable TV system was built into the development (originally provided by BT but later sold to NTL) which was the best option before satellite, since it was provided at cost price and off-air broadcasts had poor reception. This area is very prosperous, with most homeowners having a higher income than the national average. ==Transportation== There is no railway station in Martlesham Heath, but there are several bus services. ==References== * David Dymond and Peter Northeast: A History of Suffolk, Phillimore, 1985. * William White: History, Gazetteer, and Directory of Suffolk, 1844 * Gordon Kinsey: Martlesham Heath, Terence Dalton Ltd, 1975. * Paul Firman: Martlesham - The Good and Bad Old Days, The Martlesham Monthly, * Suffolk County Council: Martlesham Electoral Division Profile http://www.suffolk.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/F3AE2F7D-6C7D-427A-8078-EC8757BAB0C0/202444/52MartleshamElectoralDivisionprofile.pdf extracted June 2001 ==External links== *http://rafinsuffolk.activeboard.com/t63710657/photos-of-mh100-event *Martlesham Parish Church website *Martlesham Community Portal website Category:Villages in Suffolk ","title":"Martlesham Heath"},{"id":"2221329","text":"Minesite at Syncrude's Mildred Lake plant Syncrude Canada Ltd. is one of the world's largest producers of synthetic crude oil from oil sands and the largest single source producer in Canada.

It has approximately of proven and probable reserves (11.9 billion when including contingent and prospective resources) situated on 8 leases over 3 contiguous sites. Including fully realized prospective reserves, current production capacity could be sustained for well over 90 years. The company is a joint venture between five partners.

Between 1996 and 1999, the original mine was expanded and the plant was \\"debottlenecked\\", increasing production from per year in 1996 to 81.4 million in 1999. The total cost of this stage of expansion was $470 million. Between 1998 and 2001, a new mine, Aurora, was opened 35 km north of the original site, and further debottlenecking was undertaken. Production started in Aurora in July 2001. Syncrude's production increased to per year by the end of 2001. Total cost for this stage was $1 billion. A third stage of expansion was undertaken between 2001 and 2006, in which a second train at the Aurora line came online and the Mildred Lake upgrader was expanded. The expansion added to Syncrude's production ( a year assuming this is average). The cost was $8.4 billion, a substantial cost overrun over the original estimate of $5.7 billion. On April 12, 2010, ConocoPhillips agreed to sell its share to Sinopec, a Chinese state-owned oil company. The sale, for $4.65 billion, was completed on June 25, 2010. A 183 m (600 ft) smokestack is located at the facility which is the second tallest in western Canada. In April 2016, Suncor announced that they had reached a $937-million deal to acquire Murphy Oil Corp.'s five per cent stake in the Syncrude project north of Fort McMurray, Alta. This follows the hostile takeover of Canadian Oil Sands less than a year ago, and will increase its interest in Syncrude from just under 49 per cent to nearly 54 per cent, making it the majority shareholder of the project. The 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire forced a complete shutdown of Syncrude's facilities.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-08/alberta-s- vicious-wildfires-spread-to-suncor-oil-sands-site ==ControversiesPollution=== Air releases of combined gases without volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by Syncrude Canada in 2005 were 129,741,321 (kg) in total, including ammonia (4,302,361 kg), sulphuric acid (1,129,425 kg), xylene (501,461 kg), etc. The company was also ranked as having the seventh highest air releases of combined gases (without VOC) in Canada in 2005. Syncrude's Mildred Lake Plant Site is the largest greenhouse gas emitter in Canada emitting 12,359,420 tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2012. Research published in 2019 indicated that the intensity of CO2 emissions at the Syncrude Mildred Lake site may be 123% larger than calculations from publicly reported data would indicate. == Oil sands tailings pond water == Syncrude is a member of Canada's Oil Sands Innovation Alliance (COSIA), an alliance of oil sands producers formed in 2012, who share research on Environmental Priority Areas (EPAs) such as tailing pond water and greenhouse gases. One of the major challenges facing COSIA is the treatment of oil sands tailings pond water. \\"Tailings are the sand, silt, clay and water found naturally in oil sands that remain following the mining and bitumen extraction process.\\" The problem stems from the hot water process used by Suncor and Syncrude to extract bitumen from the Athabasca Oil Sands which produce large quantities of tailings pond sludge which remains stable for decades. By 1990 it was considered to be the \\"imminent environmental constraint to future use of the hot water process.\\" Syncrude also contributes to the industry-funded Joint Oil sands Monitoring Program which was created in 2012 and managed by the federal and Alberta governments. According to a 2013 article published in Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts, the tailings ponds contain toxic chemicals such as \\"naphthenic acids (NAs) and process chemicals (e.g., alkyl sulphates, quaternary ammonium compounds, and alkylphenol ethoxylates).\\" The study used the computer program (CXTFIT) to evaluate the transport behaviour of these contaminants through the foundation as well as underground. The chemicals seep \\"through the foundation of the tailings pond to the subsurface, potentially affecting the quality of groundwater.\\" In an article accepted for publication in Environmental Science and Technology journal in January 2014, Environment Canada's Richard Frank and his team of scientists confirmed that, using new technology, they were able to \\"fingerprint the mix of groundwater chemicals in the area\\" proving that oil sands tailings pond water had leached into groundwater and the Athabasca River. The study undertaken by a new federal- provincial oil sands monitoring program used new $1.6-million technology acquired in 2010. The equipment is able to \\"fingerprint chemicals and trace them back to where they came from.\\" === Greenpeace lawsuit === In August 2008, Syncrude Canada filed a lawsuit against Greenpeace Canada for $120,000, plus costs, after 11 Greenpeace activists went on to the company's Aurora North oil sands site July 24, 2008, to unfurl anti-oil sands banners and unsuccessfully block a tailings pipe. Company spokesperson Mark Kruger said the company filed the lawsuit‚Äîwhich also names the activists individually‚Äîlargely because of safety concerns as the activists were \\"unfamiliar with an industrial operation, and unfamiliar with some of the safety hazards that can be present... We just want to ensure that, in the future, nobody is putting themselves at unnecessary risk.\\" Greenpeace chose the Syncrude site for the protest because in April 2008, 1600 migrating ducks diedhttp://www.syncrude.ca/users/folder.asp?FolderID=7789 after landing on a tailings pond at the site (Syncrude was fined $3 million.)Jeremy Klaszus, \\"Syncrude sues greenpeace for $120,000\\" , Fast Forward Weekly, August 28, 2008 ==SponsorshipsKeyano College=== In 2004, Syncrude announced an $800,000 multi-year donation, $500,000 of which was dedicated to the new community Syncrude Sport and Wellness Centre and the balance to Keyano Theatre‚Äôs Arts Alive Series and student scholarships. In 2005, Syncrude invested another $200,000 and took the naming rights to the Syncrude Sports and Wellness Centre at Keyano College. ==See also== * Canadian Centre for Energy Information * History of the petroleum industry in Canada (oil sands and heavy oil) * Scotford Upgrader * Suncor ==References *Syncrude Canada Limited *Canadian Oil Sands Trust *Pollution Watch Canada Category:Oil companies of Canada Category:Athabasca oil sands Category:Companies based in Alberta Category:Fort McMurray Category:Energy companies established in 1964 Category:Non-renewable resource companies established in 1964 Category:Joint ventures Category:ExxonMobil subsidiaries Category:Canadian companies established in 1964 ","title":"Syncrude"},{"id":"2221332","text":"Ashburnham may refer to: * Ashburnham, East Sussex, England *** Ashburnham Place, a country house in that village, the ancestral home of the Ashburnham family. * Ashburnham, Massachusetts, United States * Ashburnham, Ontario, Canada, a village annexed by the city of Peterborough in 1904 * Ashburnham (surname) * Earl of Ashburnham * John Ashburnham (disambiguation) * Ashburnham baronets * Ashburnham House, London, place of the 1731 Ashburnham House fire.

He first played professionally in the band The Cortinas, formed in 1963. The Cortinas released one single in 1968 on Polydor Records called \\"Phoebe's Flower Shop\\" and were renamed Octopus the same year. Octopus, which included Griggs' brother Nigel, supported many well-known groups including Cream and Yes and they released one LP (Restless Night, Penny Farthing, April 1971) and several singles. During its existence, Octopus had several members who later joined famous groups: Drummer Brian Glascock, John Cook and Tim Reeves of Mungo Jerry, and brother Nigel Griggs and Malcolm Green, both later of New Zealand group, Split Enz. According to the Nottingham Post, \\"There was a point ‚Äì when Octopus cut a single and album ‚Äì when it looked like fame would be theirs ... but it didn't happen.\\" When Octopus disbanded, Griggs joined vocal group Guys 'n' Dolls and their first single \\"There's a Whole Lot of Loving\\" reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. Griggs did not feature on this recording. It had been pre-recorded by session musicians. This was followed by other chart placements. In September 1978, Guys 'n' Dolls supported Frank Sinatra for a week of concerts at the Royal Festival Hall in London and in the same year they took part in the Yamaha Song Festival in Tokyo. Guys 'n' Dolls spent their last years in the Netherlands and during that time Griggs released two solo singles, the first a medley of Shadows instrumentals under the title of \\"Guitar Collection\\" for EMI Holland. The second a cover of The Beatles song \\"You Won't See Me\\" for \\"Dureco\\". After the group disbanded in 1985 Griggs assumed responsibility for Everyday Music Ltd in England, and concentrated on writing and producing. In 1986 he was a finalist in A Song for Europe with his composition, \\"I'm Sorry\\" which was performed by Chad Brown, and a year later his song \\"No More Tears\\" was runner- up in \\"The Buddy Holly Song Contest\\" that was organised and judged by Paul McCartney. Griggs received his award from McCartney at a dinner in London. Griggs has also released a solo CD on his own Fenman label called My Songs (Fen 001CD), on which he played and composed every track. In 1997, he made a guest appearance on the BBC Two quiz show, Never Mind the Buzzcocks. Griggs' song \\"I Don't Wanna Lose You\\" was recorded by Lonnie Donegan, and featured on Donegan's album Muleskinner Blues. In 2008, Griggs self-published a memoir, Diary of a Musician (Fenman Paperback) based on the diaries he kept from 1960. ==Discography== The Cortinas * \\"Phoebe's Flower Shop\\" / \\"Too Much in Love\\" (Polydor, May 1968) Octopus *\\"Laugh at the Poor Man\\" / \\"Girlfriend\\" (Penny Farthing, Nov 1969) * \\"The River\\" / \\"Thief\\" (Penny Farthing, May 1970) *Restless Night (Penny Farthing, April 1971) Guys 'n' Dolls ==References*My Memories of Lonnie Donegan by Paul Griggs Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:English male singers Category:English songwriters Category:English autobiographers Category:People from St Albans Category:Musicians from Hertfordshire ","title":"Paul Griggs"},{"id":"2221349","text":"The Parsons Arboretum (19 acres; 7.6 hectares) is an arboretum and garden located adjacent to the corner of 21st and Briggs Avenue in Glenwood Park, Parsons, Kansas, United States.

Franklin currently works in the Cardinals‚Äô front office. ==Early life== He was born in Fort Smith, Arkansas and grew up in Spiro, Oklahoma. He graduated from high school in Spiro in 1991 and was named to the All-State baseball team. He went to Seminole Junior College, in Oklahoma, where he had a 20-0 win-loss record over two years. ==Playing careerSeattle Mariners=== Franklin was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the 23rd round of the 1992 MLB draft but chose to return to school. He signed his first MLB contract with the team on May 21, 1993. He made his MLB debut in 1999, appearing in 6 games. In 2000, he began the season in Triple-A, and then decided (with club permission) to not play at the MLB in September in order to participate in the Olympics. During those Olympics in Sydney, he and his teammates won a gold medal, defeating Cuba 4-0 in the title game. After missing the 2000 season in the big leagues, Franklin posted a strong spring training and won a job in the Mariners bullpen, appearing in 38 games. The next season, Franklin began the season in the bullpen but after the first half of the season, was moved to the rotation. He finished with a record of 7-5 in 41 appearances, 12 starts. In 2003, Franklin began in the rotation and was one of the Mariners most consistent starters, posting an ERA of 3.57 in 212 innings. He tied for the Major League lead in home runs allowed in 2003, with 34. In 2004, Franklin and the whole Seattle team struggled, losing 99 games. Franklin for his part went 4-16 with a 4.90 ERA in 200 innings. He struck out a career high 104. In 2005, he went 8-15 with a career high 5.10 in 190 innings. He struck out 93. After the 2005 season, Franklin filed for free agency. ===Philadelphia Phillies=== On January 13, Franklin signed a one-year, $2.5 million contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. Franklin shifted back to a bullpen role, appearing in 46 games. ===Cincinnati Reds=== On August 7, 2006, Franklin was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for a player to be named later, who turned out to be minor league pitcher Zac Stott. Franklin pitched the rest of the season out of the bullpen, appearing in 20 games. ===St. Louis Cardinals=== On January 22, , Franklin signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on a one-year, $1 million contract. He signed a two-year, $5 million contract extension with a $2.75 million club option for 2010 on July 5, 2007. He was promoted to closer on May 17, . Franklin was named to the 2009 All-Star Game roster. On September 1, , Franklin signed a two-year, $6.5 million contract extension with the Cardinals. In 2009, he finished the regular season with a 1.92 ERA, and 38 saves. On April 19, 2011, Franklin (who blew 2 saves in 29 chances in the 2010 season) was removed from his closer role after (among other struggles on the mound) blowing four saves in five chances to start the 2011 season. Despite the poor season he is still considered a World Series Champion in 2011 with the St. Louis Cardinals. He was released on June 29, after recording an 8.46 ERA, giving up 44 hits (.367 batting average against), nine home runs, walking seven and striking out 17 in 27 2/3 innings for a 1.84 WHIP in 21 games with the Cardinals in 2011.

It occurs very commonly as a harmless commensal on human and animal skin and is known for producing thioalcohol compounds that contribute to body odour. Like many other coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. hominis may occasionally cause infection in patients whose immune systems are compromised, for example by chemotherapy or predisposing illness. ==Description== Colonies of S. hominis are small, usually 1‚Äì2 mm in diameter after 24 hours' incubation at 35 ¬∞C, and white or tan in colour. Occasionally, strains are resistant to novobiocin and may be confused with other resistant species (e.g. S. saprophyticus). It is one of only two species of Staphylococcus to display sensitivity to desferrioxamine, the other being S. epidermidis. Unlike S. epidermidis, S. hominis produces acid from trehalose, so the two tests together serve to identify the species. ==Biology== Numerous coagulase-negative staphylococci appear commonly on the skin of human. Of these species, S. epidermidis and S. hominis are the most abundant. While S. epidermidis tends to colonize the upper part of the body, S. hominis tends to colonize in areas with numerous apocrine glands, such as axillae and the pubic region. In a certain study, S. hominis was calculated to account for 22% of the total staphylococcal species recovered from individuals, second to S. epidermidis at 46%. S. hominis is the predominant species on the head, axillae, arms, and legs. S. hominis, as well as most other staphylococcal species common on the human skin, is able to produce acid aerobically from glucose, fructose, sucrose, trehalose, and glycerol. Some strains were also able to produce acid from turanose, lactose, galactose, melezitose, mannitol, and mannose. Most strains colonize on the skin for relatively short periods of time compared to other Staphylococcus species. They, on average, stay on the skin for only several weeks or months. The cell wall contains low amounts of teichoic acid and glutamic acid. The cell wall teichoic acid contains glycerol and glucosamine. S. hominis cells are Gram-positive cocci, usually 1.2 to 1.4 Œºm in diameter. They appear normally in tetrads and sometimes in pairs. ===Resistance=== Based on a total of 240 strains, all were resistant to lysozyme, some were slightly resistant to lysostaphin, 77% were susceptible to penicillin G, 97% to streptomycin, 93% to erythromycin, 64% to tetracycline, and 99% to novobiocin. Multi drug resistant strains of s. hominis have been isolated from blood and wound cultures in humans. ==Culturing== When grown in agar cultures, colonies are usually circular, 4.0 to 4.5 mm in diameter. Agar colonies usually have wide edges and an elevated center. They are commonly smooth with dull surfaces, and are yellow-orange pigmented in the center of the opaque colonies. They grow both in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, but tend to grow significantly less in the latter. Optimal NaCl concentrations of the agar culture for the growth of S. hominis seem to be around 7.5%, and a salt concentration of 15% yielded poor growth to no growth at all. The optimal growth temperature range was around 28 to 40 ¬∞C, but good growth is still observed at 45 ¬∞C, while no growth is observed at 15 ¬∞C. S. hominis can be differentiated from staphylococci by its colony morphology and pigmentation patterns, predominant tetrad cell arrangement, poor growth in thioglycolate, low tolerance of NaCl, and carbohydrate reaction pattern. Each species is also significantly different in cell wall composition, lactic acid configuration, temperature extremes of growth, coagulase activity, hemolysis acetylmethylcarbinol production, nitrate reduction, and phosphatase, DNase, and bacteriolytic activities. Similarities in these properties between S. hominis and several other species suggest a close relationship between S. hominis and S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, and S. warneri. ==Antibiotic-resistant subspecies== S. hominis is normally found on human skin and is usually harmless, but can sometimes cause infections in people with abnormally weak immune systems. Most, if not all, strains are susceptible to penicillin, erythromycin, and novobiocin, but a divergent strain, S. hominis subsp. novobiosepticus (SHN), was isolated between 1989 and 1996. This strain was named so because of its unique resistance to novobiocin and its failure to produce acid aerobically from trehalose and glucosamine. In addition, the 26 isolated strains of this new subspecies are resistant to nalidixic acid, penicillin G, oxacillin, kanamycin, and streptomycin. They were also somewhat resistant to methicillin and gentamicin, and most strains were resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and ciprofloxacin, as well. In addition, S. hominis hominis is commonly found isolated from human skin, but as of 1998, no SHN isolate from human skin had been reported. The SHN is so similar to the original S. hominis, now called S. hominis subsp. hominis, that in 2010, a MicroScan system that clinical microbiology laboratories used, identified 7 of 31 S. hominis novobiosepticus cultures as S. hominis hominis. The relationship between the two was unknown, but antibiotic-resistant isolates of S. hominis belonged only to SHN. SHN strains seems to have thickened cell walls, which can be the result of a genetic background that also allows for vancomycin resistance. The thickened cell walls exist in subspecies with and without vancomycin resistance which suggests this subspecies did not originate from the acquiring of resistance genes. ===Origin=== The combined resistance to novobiocin and oxacillin is hypothesized to have originated from a simultaneous introduction of genes controlling the resistance to the two. These genes were believed to have been acquired originally through heterologous DNA from a methicillin-resistant strain of one of the novobiocin-resistant species belonging to the S. sciuri or the S. saprophyticus groups. The larger genome size of the SHN compared to that of S. hominis hominis may be the result of the acquiring of heterologous DNA. This new, divergent strain was first described in 1998, and was first implicated in causing bacteremia in 2002. Another hypothesis is the insertion of the mec A gene and its flanking sequence into the chromosome of SHN might have affected the expression of a closely linked gene, which converted the host to become novobiocin-resistant. ===Recent cases=== In 2002 and 2003, 32 isolates of SHN were found in 21 patients. Twenty-three of these were from blood cultures, six from catheters, one from cerebrospinal fluid, one from a wound, and one from external ear fluid. Eighteen of the 21 patients from whom these isolates were recovered were neonates, one was a 13-year-old boy, and two were adults. Thirteen of these cases were confirmed as sepsis in neonates resulting from SHN infection. These were the first clinical reports of SHN causing bacterimia in hospitalized patients. SHN infections were high in morbidity, but had a low rate of mortality. More undocumented instances of SHN infections may not have been reported because not all coagulase-negative staphlococcal infections (CONs) are identified to the species level. Molecular epidemiology was successful in tracing 13 cases of sepsis in neonates to a single clone of SHN during a two-year study period in neonatal ICUs. Formal investigation regarding the mode of transmission this microbe uses were not conducted, but infants are believed to serve as reservoirs for the microorganism, and transmission takes place with contact between health workers and the infants. In addition, staphylococcal isolates from the nasopharynges and hands of health care workers were shown to be genetically similar to those that colonize or cause disease in neonates. This supports the idea that health workers serve as a form of nosocomical transmission of CONs. If SHN indeed takes residence on human skin, it probably exists in small numbers and would require enrichment for detection. SHN has also been responsible for nosocomial outbreaks elsewhere. SHN strains have been causing bloodstream infections, but have still been classified as vancomycin- susceptible. In May 2015, two babies from Simojovel rural communities of Chiapas, Mexico, were killed and about 30 required medical attention after receiving vaccines for Hepatitis B, the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) launched an investigation to identify the cause of suchs events, the preliminary results showed that the cause was external contamination with Staphylococcus hominis. ==References *Type strain of Staphylococcus hominis at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase hominis Category:Gram-positive bacteria Category:Bacteria described in 1975 ","title":"Staphylococcus hominis"},{"id":"2221360","text":"It Takes a Family is a 2005 book by then Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum. The title is a response to the 1996 book It Takes a Village by then-First Lady Hillary Clinton. In the book, Santorum states that the family structure is necessary. He argues that liberal social policies have devastated the family structure and that prevailing socially liberal attitudes have systematically devalued families across the board. He argues that government should take a proactive role in promoting strong families. ==Summary== Santorum criticizes alike laissez-faire conservatives and liberal proponents of social welfare for promoting a radical view of autonomy. In particular, he criticizes the \\"bigs\\" -- \\"big government, big media, big entertainment, big universities.\\" He also says that radical feminists are responsible for undermining the traditional family.Faces Questions on Women in the Work Force He explained his views in an interview with National Public Radio: > They have this idea that people should be left alone, be able to do whatever > they want to do.

The magazine's book service called the book's ideas \\"innovative\\" and \\"based on sound values -- including the centrality of the family to all social and political life.\\" National Review Book Service products page A review by Keith Fournier in Catholic Online likewise praises the book, saying, \\"The author's discussion of how to create a family friendly public policy which promotes fidelity and encourages motherhood, fatherhood and intact families is well thought out and practical.\\"http://www.catholic.org/featured/headline.php?ID=2398 Review of It Takes a Family,Catholic Online, July 25, 2005 Many reviews were critical of Santorum's work. Claiming that Santorum's social vision was anything but innovative or refreshing, one reviewer for The Philadelphia Inquirer referred to Santorum as \\"one of the finest minds of the Thirteenth Century\\". Writing for American Prospect Online, reviewer Mark Schmitt argues that the book fails to present a unified case for how social conservatism is served by laissez- faire economic policies, yet urges readers to commit to both; he also asserts that the author offers several solutions already proposed by his opposition, while criticizing the opposition's failure to provide solutions.http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&name;=ViewWeb&articleId;=10054 \\"It Takes a Democrat\\" (review of It Takes a Family), American Prospect Online, July 29, 2005 Ruth Conniff, reviewing the book for The Progressive, comments that certain arguments and examples in the book are seemingly at odds. As an example, the reviewer points out that a success story cited by Santorum as an example of a single mother getting off welfare actually showcases a number of strategies the senator opposes -- leaving the children's father, use of public shelters, and use of welfare to support the family while getting an education, rather than leaving school to take a job.http://www.progressive.org/mag_conniff1005 \\"Rick Santorum's America,\\" The Progressive, October 2005 Passages from It Takes a Family generated controversy during Santorum's 2006 reelection campaign, as well as during his 2012 presidential campaign.

At the same time, the institute's first director, Dr. Leopold Robert, requested contributions from foreigners living in Thailand for the establishment of a snake farm, which would enable the institute to manufacture antivenom for snake bites. Reportedly the second snake farm in the world after the one in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, it was opened on 22 November 1923 by Queen Savang Vadhana, then President of the Thai Red Cross, on the institute's premises.http://saovabha.redcross.or.th/download/2558/R2558_062558_P6.PDF Research into snake venom is highly important, since many people fall victim to venomous snake bites. Normally only an antidote that is based from the same snake's venom can save the individual's life. The snake farm houses thousands of some of the most venomous snakes in the world, such as the king cobra and all sorts of vipers. Visitors can see handlers interact with pythons, and venom extractions can be seen. There is also a museum, and lectures are given. The QSMI and the snake farm are near Chulalongkorn Hospital, on the corner of Henri Dunant Road and Rama IV Road. ==References * FactZoo.com  Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute's Visitors Brochure * Thai Red Cross  Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute * Bangkok Metropolitan Administration  Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute * Out About Bangkok  Queen Saovapha Memorial Institute (includes details of institute's work) * Blurrytravel.com  Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute (includes photos) * Thailandguidebook.com  Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute (includes photos) * Virtualtourist.com  Bangkok Travel Guide (includes reviews and photos) Category:Snakes Category:Tourist attractions in Bangkok Category:Research institutes in Thailand Category:Biological research institutes Category:Pathum Wan District Category:Museums in Bangkok Category:ASA Architectural Conservation Award recipients Category:Unregistered ancient monuments in Bangkok ","title":"Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute"},{"id":"2221374","text":"8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter is an American television sitcom that originally aired on ABC from September 17, 2002 to April 15, 2005.

Born in Moscow to a Russian-Jewish family, she later traveled to Geneva in the 1890s to study chemistry at Geneva University. Her early research included the development of a process to remove sulfur and phosphorus from acetylene. Her first article on the derivatives of benzophenone, coauthored by German chemist Fritz Ullman, was published in 1897. She also researched and wrote a paper (published in 1904) on using copper as a catalyst for the preparation of a phenyl derivative of thiosalicylic acid, a process known as the Ullmann reaction; Goldberg is the only woman scientist unambiguously recognized for her own named reaction: the amidation (Goldberg) reaction. This modification to previous forms of the method was a great improvement, and was extremely helpful for laboratory-scale preparations. She coordinated on other forms of chemistry research with her husband, Fritz Ullmann, in what they called the Ullmann-Goldberg collaborative. In 1905, both Goldberg and Ullman moved to Technische Hochschule in Berlin. Goldberg's research, along with that of the Ullmann- Goldberg collaborative, was also a part of Germany's synthetic dye industry. Their research helped with the creation of the synthetic alizarin industry, or the process of replacing natural dye obtained from madder. In 1909, Goldberg also collaborated with Hermann Friedman to review German patents under BASF (Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik) and Bayer & Co. Farbenfabriken, providing notes on preparation for 114 dyes. In 1910, Goldberg married Ullman. In 1923, they moved back to Geneva when Ullman accepted a faculty position at Geneva University. Her exact death date is not known, but her name does appear at the top of a list of people signing a memorial notice in a Geneva newspaper for her deceased husband, Fritz Ullmann in 1939. ==See also== *Timeline of women in science ==References * Category:Russian women scientists Category:German women scientists Category:19th-century women scientists Category:20th-century women scientists Category:Russian women chemists Category:German women chemists Category:Organic chemists Category:1871 births Category:Year of death missing ","title":"Irma Goldberg"},{"id":"2221379","text":"The Pachakutik Plurinational Unity Movement ‚Äì New Country () is a left wing indigenist party in Ecuador. It was founded primarily as a way to advance the interests of a wide variety of indigenous peoples' organizations throughout Ecuador. ==Origin== In the context of Ecuador's indigenous movement, Pachakutik emerged after successful civil society mobilizations by large indigenous organizations such as CONAIE and CONFENAIE. Despite being backed by CONAIE and the workers' Social Movement Cooperation, the party is not affiliated with the organizations, as its official purpose was to serve as an alternative to the traditional cluster of political parties that had ruled Ecuadorian politics. The party has been a topic of controversy among indigenous peoples throughout Ecuador because of its nature as a political party, and many indigenous people are unwilling to recognize it as representing their interests because they feel that the party has compromised too many indigenous demands in order to participate in the political process. ==Electoral history== Pachakutik participated in the presidential elections of 1996 despite having only been formed a few months beforehand. In order to give a strong media boost to the party in their first presidential election, they recruited a former TV personality named Freddy Ehlers to represent the party on the highest national stage. Although Ehlers failed to win the election, he placed third with nearly twenty percent of the popular vote despite having less than five months to prepare his campaign. In addition, eight members of Pachakutik won seats as national deputies, including CONAIE president Luis Macas, and although they constituted less than ten percent of the seats in the National Congress of Ecuador, the presence of the party was undeniable. For the first time indigenous citizens of Ecuador were present in Congress, representing the interests of all groups throughout the country. Pachakutik, along with a strong civil society effort by CONAIE and others, was instrumental in pushing for the new Ecuadorian Constitution in 1998 which, among other things, recognized the country as multi-cultural, paving the way for such reforms as bilingual education. Since the 1998 elections in which Pachakutik's amount of representation declined, the party has never quite reached its prior levels of support and has been unable to topple the majority of the Congress that does not share their views. It has been criticized by CONAIE for its ineffectiveness, leading to a coup d'√©tat in 2000 organized by CONAIE in association with sympathetic members of the military. Although after only hours of taking the capital and instituting a three-man junta including CONAIE president Antonio Vargas the government dissipated, echoing CONAIE's frustration. Pachakutik has since distanced itself somewhat from CONAIE while still remaining intensely involved with gaining indigenous rights. At the 2002 legislative elections, the party won at least 11 out of 100 seats. Its candidate Lucio Guti√©rrez, member of the Patriotic Society Party 21 January won 20.3% of the vote in the presidential elections of the same day and won the second round with 58.7%. After three months of government Gutierrez broke up its alliance with Pachakutik and he discharged its ministers. The party soon grew to despise him and publicly criticize him. In 2003 they even began to call for the removal of President Guti√©rrez publicly in the media. The political party is struggling with problems of identity at this point in time and is in risk of losing all that it had originally gained in 1996. However, with Gutierrez out, the return of Luis Macas to the presidency of CONAIE and the opposition to the signature of an agreement of free trade with United States, they have been able to reunify to the movement. At the 2006 elections, the party won at least 6 out of 100 seats. Its candidate Luis Macas, obtained 2.19% of the vote in the presidential elections of the same day. At the 2009 elections, the party had its worst results since its founding, but still maintains representation, with 4 seats out of 124 in National Assembly. At the 2013 elections, the party won at least 5 out of 137 seats. Its candidate Alberto Acosta, obtained 3.26% of the vote in the presidential elections of the same day. ==2010 Ecuador crisis== During the 2010 Ecuador coup d'√©tat attempt, Pachakutik stated that President Rafael Correa was authoritarian and issued a press release opposing him and supporting police and army rebels. American-Venezuelan lawyer Eva Golinger accused Pachakutik of having accepted funding from USAID and NED, and playing a role as part of a United States plan to destabilise Latin American democracies in the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA). Pachakutik denied \\"having any relationship at all with the organism known as USAID, previously NED, not today nor ever\\". Golinger responded by referring to a National Democratic Institute (NDI, one of the four institutes funded by NED) report from 2007 describing Pachakutik being trained by the NDI in \\"Triangle of Party Best Practices and strategic planning methodologies\\" as part of NDI's Latin American/Caribbean Political Party Network of over 1400 individual members, funded under NED Core Grants 2000-031, 2001-048, 2003-028, and 2004-036. ==See also== * Pachakuti ==References *Official web site *Luis Macas Home Page *CONAIE Category:1996 establishments in Ecuador Category:Indigenist political parties in South America Category:Indigenous organisations in Ecuador Category:Political parties established in 1996 Category:Plurinational Unity of the Lefts Category:Socialist parties in Ecuador ","title":"Pachakutik Plurinational Unity Movement ‚Äì New Country"},{"id":"2221380","text":"Serena (born February 20, 1951) is an American former pornographic actress.

It was produced by Fred Quimby, directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, and the musical supervision was by Scott Bradley. Ed Barge, Michael Lah, and Kenneth Muse animated it; Pete Burness and Ray Patterson were uncredited animators. Excerpts of this cartoon are seen in three other Tom and Jerry shorts: Jerry's Diary, Smitten Kitten, and Smarty Cat, the latter instance with altered audio and an added scene of Tom whistling. == Plot == In the backyard is a doghouse labeled \\"Killer\\" with the dog (Spike) inside. Tom pokes his head over the wall and spots Toodles in the window. Tom has brought a string instrument (which appears to be a hybrid of a double bass and a cello). He leaps over the fence and neutralizes Spike by whistling at him and hitting him on the head with a mallet and tying him up. Tom then uses his instrument like a pogo stick to jump his way over to the window, stopping to flick Spike's nose along the way. Tom performs \\"Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby\\" to Toodles, which makes Jerry sleeping inside his mousehole wake up. Annoyed by the sounds, he pokes out of a mail slot and spots Tom playing the instrument. He goes back to his bed and covers himself with the pillow, however the sound waves from the instrument shake Jerry's mousehole, causing Jerry to fall out of bed (while still trying to cover his ears) and vibrate his way under a table, meanwhile a flower pot is vibrated across the table directly above Jerry's head and falls on him when both reach the edge of the table. Outside, Tom uses the instrument as a bow to shoot himself to Spike, who is still being tyed, tortures the dog by plucking its mouth, and runs back to the string instrument. The camera goes back inside Jerry's mousehole, whose stuff is messed up and broken by the vibration. Jerry continues being moved to under the mail hole's lid right before a match holding it falls, making the lid slam Jerry. Having had enough, Jerry throws off his nightcap, goes out of the mousehole to the kitchen and decides to get revenge by stuffing an iron into a pie which he then hurls at Tom through an open window; the cat is angered, but continues with a few more bars. Seconds later, he is hit in the face again ‚Äì this time with a pie covered in whipped cream. Spotting Jerry, Tom chases him through the house. Both animals dive off an ironing board; with Jerry ahead of Tom, Jerry drains the kitchen sink he landed in, leaving Tom to crash into the crockery. Tom follows Jerry through the open window, but Jerry pulls the window stop out of the window, which falls on Tom's neck, and Tom shrieks in pain. Jerry then runs out and unties Spike, who lets out a loud bull roar. Spike swaps his regular teeth for larger ones, blows off some pent-up steam, and goes after Tom. Tom ducks as Spike's teeth come at him, which instead get lodged in a tree trunk. Tom then barely avoids getting his tail bitten and hides behind a wall, holding a brick up ready to attack. Spike sees the brick and investigates, but gets knocked on the head with it. Jerry revives Spike by hitting him with a wooden plank on his rear end. After slamming Spike, Spike leaps high in the air screaming in pain just as Jerry hands off the board to Tom, framing the cat. Knowing he is in trouble, Tom tricks Spike into believing the board is a stick by playing \\"fetch\\". Spike obliges and fetches but then realizes he's been tricked. Tom and Spike then begin a back and forth chase with Toodles Galore watching on. Tom stops periodically to kiss the cat. Catching on to this habit, Spike substitutes himself on the third pass, and gets wooed in a Charles Boyer voice (through archive lines from The Zoot Cat), but stops his speech abruptly when he sees the female cat. Realizing his mistake, he throws Spike onto the ground. Tom hides from Spike's rampage until Jerry walks around the corner; he chases Jerry into Spike's house, closing the door with a murderous laugh and Dracula leer. A second later, the door opens and Jerry emerges with Spike helping him out of the doghouse, Spike laughing even more evilly as he withdraws inside. The entire dog house thrashes about as Spike beats up Tom, who attempts to flee only to be snatched by Spike. Tom manages to write his last will before he's wrenched back in and beaten to within an inch of his life. In the end, Tom becomes part of his instrument in place of the strings with Spike strumming the cat's tail while Jerry bows a dramatic ostinato on Tom's whiskers and Toodles watches. ==Voice cast== * Billy Bletcher as Killer (Spike) and Tom (laughing).

Bulosan was the fourth oldest son of the family. As a young Filipino, he once lived on the farm tended by his father, while his mother was separately living in a barrio in Binalonan, Pangasinan, together with Bulosan's brother and sister. Their hardships included pawning their land and having to sell items in order to finish the schooling of his brother Macario. He had another brother named Leon, a soldier who came back after fighting in Europe. Bulosan's narration about his life in the Philippines was followed by his journey to the United States. He recounted how he immigrated to America in 1930. He retells the struggles, prejudice, and injustice he and other Filipinos had endured in the United States, first while in the Northwestern fisheries then later in California. These included his experiences as a migrant and laborer in the rural West. ==Themes== Bulosan's America Is in the Heart is one of the few books that detail the migrant workers' struggles in the United States during the 1930s through the 1940s, a time when signs like \\"Dogs and Filipinos not allowed\\" were common. The struggles included \\"beatings, threats, and ill health\\". In this book, Bulosan also narrated his attempts to establish a labor union. Bulosan's book had been compared to The Grapes of Wrath except that the main and real characters were brown-skinned. Despite the bitterness however, Bulosan reveals in the final pages of the book that because he loved America no one could ever destroy his faith in his new country. In this personal literature, Bulosan argued that despite the suffering and abuses he experienced, America was an unfinished \\"ideal in which everyone must invest (...) time and energy, (...) this outlook leaves us with a feeling of hope for the future instead of bitter defeat.\\" According to Carlos P. Romulo when he was interviewed by The New York Times, Bulosan wrote America Is in the Heart with \\"bitterness\\" in his heart and blood yet with the purpose of contributing \\"something toward the final fulfillment of America\\". Through America Is in the Heart, Bulosan was able to share a unique perspective on Asian life in the United States in general, but particularly that of Filipino-Americans during the first half of the 20th century. It is a book that encourages people of all races and genders to ponder and improve their relationships with one another. ==Publication history== After the 1946 printing, America Is in the Heart was republished by the University of Washington Press in 1973. Because of its subtitle \\"A Personal History\\", America Is in the Heart is regarded as an autobiography but ‚Äì according to P.C. Morantte (Bulosan's friend) ‚Äì had to be \\"fictionalized\\" by Bulosan, imbibing the book with real characters. Thus it was described by one character in the book's original draft as \\"30% autobiography, 40% case history of Pinoy (Filipino immigrant) life in America, and 30% fiction\\".A Look at the Life of Carlos Bulosan and his Book \\"America is in the Heart\\", academon.com ==Historical contextGreat Depression=== As can be evidenced by Carlos Bulosan‚Äôs America Is in the Heart, the life of a Filipino migrant worker during the Great Depression was anything but easy. In reality, the life of any Filipino in the United States during this time period was ‚Äúlonely‚Äù and ‚Äúdamned,‚Äù as Bulosan described in a letter to a friend. When he and his friend Jos√© arrived in California in 1930, ‚Äúthe lives of Filipinos were cheaper than those of dogs.‚Äù As the Filipino population grew and the Great Depression worsened, the anti-Filipino movement flourished. This attitude towards Bulosan and his people was led by the same forces that previously condemned the Chinese and the Japanese, and in 1928, the American Federation of Labor encouraged an ‚Äúexclusion‚Äù of the race, which was warmly received in Congress. Despite the fact that most of these immigrants were modernized and able to speak more than one European language, there was a persistent tendency to portray them not only as primitive savages but also sexual threats against white women. The anti-Filipino sentiment that plagued the American mindset during this time period can be observed in a few separate events. The most violent and well known incident occurred in California in 1930: four hundred white vigilantes attacked a Filipino night club, injuring dozens and killing one. In 1933, California and twelve other state legislatures restricted Filipino-white marriages. Lastly, in 1935 the Welch Bill volunteered a fixed sum of cash to pay for the fare of Filipinos who would voluntarily go back to the Philippines. Events such as these prove the anti-Filipino sentiment that afflicted Carlos Bulosan and the rest of the Filipino population. Without the tribulations of a migrant life during the Great Depression, Bulosan would not have been compelled to write down his thoughts, nor would he have aligned so heavily with the Communist party. The Great Depression in western America was the cause of strong bonds between culture groups and families and further fueled the racial tensions between the white farm owners and the migrant workers.Denning, Michael. The Cultural Front: The Laboring of American Culture in the Twentieth Century. New York: Verso, 1996. Print. As documented in Bulosan's novel, ‚Äúfraternity is not limited to biological brothers; the network of young migrant men from the same region serves not only as a microcosm of the Filipino community, but as a gallery of alternative lives and fates‚Ä¶‚ÄùDenning, 1996 Because of this connection, when Carlos‚Äô brothers and fellow Filipino workers began to join the Communist party, the only logical response was to follow suit. Bulosan's novel compares to other works written by authors who lived through the Great Depression in that the combination of a strong racial identity and the exposure to the harsh working environments caused the protagonist to desire something more from life. Bulosan ‚Äúcame to represent the ‚Äòvoice of Bataan‚Äô,‚Äù because of this strong desire, fueled by the obstacles caused by the Great Depression. Bulosan's writings reached a wide audience, many of whom were feeling similar strife due to the state of the nation‚Äôs economy. The agriculture community in the West, especially in California, was characterized by a deficit in jobs and a life of transience.Fanslow, Robin A. \\"The Migrant Experience.\\" American Memory. Library of Congress, 6 Apr. 1998. Web. 17 Apr. 2011. . Bulosan‚Äôs writing provides an accurate first-hand description of the uncertainty of a migrant‚Äôs life, and while there is speculation about the amount of truth in his writing, one cannot deny that he was exposed first-hand to the struggles of The Great Depression. ==Filipino-American literatureBulosan's message=== America Is in the Heart serves as a piece of activist literature. It sheds light on the racial and class issues that affected Filipino immigrants throughout the beginning of the twentieth century. The autobiography attempts to show Filipino Americans the structure of American society and the oppression inflicted upon Filipino‚Äôs living in America. E. San Juan, Jr., in ‚ÄúCarlos Bulosan, Filipino Writer-Activist‚Äù, states, ‚ÄúAmerican administrators, social scientist, intellectuals, and others made sense of Filipinos: we were (like American Indians) savages, half childish primitives, or innocuous animals that can be either civilized with rigorous tutelage or else slaughtered outright‚Äù.San Juan, E., Jr., \\"Carlos Bulosan, Filipino Writer-Activist: Between a Time of Terror and the Time of Revolution.\\" New Centennial Review. 8.1 (2008): 104-134. Print. In America Is in the Heart, Bulosan properly shows the reader the animalistic treatment that was inflicted upon the Filipino's on the west coast. Bulosan states, ‚ÄúAt that time, there was ruthless persecution of the Filipinos throughout the Pacific Coast‚Äù.Bulosan, Carlos. America Is in the Heart: a Personal History. Seattle: University of Washington, 1973. Print. He wants Filipinos and even white Americans to realize the harmful treatment of Filipinos and the problems of society. Bulosan continues his activism through irony in his novel. ‚ÄúBehind the triumphant invocation of a mythical 'America' linger the unforgettable images of violence, panicked escape, horrible mutilation, and death in Bulosan‚Äôs works‚Äù. Throughout his novel, Bulosan mentions the death and violence that is inflicted upon Filipino immigrants. After being informed of a labor camp being burned down, he states, ‚ÄúI understood it to be a racial issue, because everywhere I went I saw white men attacking Filipinos‚Äù. He later stated, ‚ÄúWhy was America so kind and yet so cruel?‚Äù Though America was supposed to be a place of freedom and kindness for Filipino Americans to escape to, Filipinos were treated like savages and were oppressed by white Americans. Bulosan makes this clear in his novel in order to present these problems to society. ===Influence on later Filipino-American writers=== Throughout his career, Carlos Bulosan has provided examples of the Filipino American identity that affected future Filipino American and the issues they approached. In 1942, Chorus For America: Six Filipino Poets became the first Filipino poetry anthology published in America. It was based on the works of Bulosan and five other poets.Reyes, Bobby. \\"Filipino Literature in the United States (Part 3 of Series) - MabuhayRadio  MabuhayRadio.\\" Home  MabuhayRadio. 26 May 2007. Web. 17 Apr. 2011. . At a time when Asians were being persecuted in America, Bulosan was attempting to distinguish Filipino-Americans from the umbrella term ‚ÄúAsian-American‚Äù. America Is in the Heart speaks to this struggle to retain one's identity in a new world. The graphic and gritty description of the Filipino town Bibalonan shocked the readers into realizing its distinction. It is a ‚Äúdamned town‚Äù where women are stoned to death and babies are left unwanted by the wayside. America Is in the Heart described the indelible mark a person's background has on his or her life, highlighting the failures of generalizing racial identities. Ironically, it is Bulosan's success and America Is in the Heart‚Äôs dominance in the study of Filipino- American literature that may have a greater impact of then his actual words. There is great debate whether the agenda for Filipino American writers should be, ‚Äúto exile themselves from the home country or to accept the status of a hyphenated American or to find a bridge between the two.‚ÄùHebbar, Reshmi. \\"Filipino American Literature.\\" Emory University---English Department \\"Where Courageous Inquiry Leads\\" Apr.-May 1998. Web. 17 Apr. 2011. . King-Kok Cheung believes that Bulosan is so celebrated due to a lack of attention to Filipino American writers ‚Äúwhose exilic writings did not fit with the immigrant ethos‚Äù of America.Cheung, King-Kok, ed. An Interethnic Companion to Asian American Literature. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997. One of Bulosan's most important themes as a writer was the importance to find one's identity in America. Bulosan reveals his faith and love for America in the end of America Is in the Heart. This sentiment is repeated in an essay entitled Be American, where Bulosan described American citizenship as a ‚Äúmost cherished dream‚Äù.Bulosan, Carlos, and Juan E. San. On Becoming Filipino: Selected Writings of Carlos Bulosan. Philadelphia: Temple UP, 1995. Print. Even if his writing did seem more conducive to the accepted image of immigrants, Bulosan opened the door for later writers to push the envelope of acceptance. Filipino-American writers of more recent years, such as Ninotchka Rosca and Linda Ty-Casper, have continued to highlight the complexity of a totally unified Filipino-American identity. ==See also== *I Walked with Heroes, an autobiography by Carlos P.

This order was poorly attended to until 1811, when it was renewed, and the following year Assarotti, with a considerable number of pupils, took possession of the new school.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1915 to 1936, and was Speaker of the Assembly from 1923 to 1936. His name sometimes appears as Peter Talbot. Talbot was born at St. Pierre du Sud, in the county of Montmagny, Qu√©bec, the son of Elzear Talbot and Delina Bacon, and was educated at St. Ferdinand d'Halifax College. Talbot first worked as a telegraph operator and was employed with the Canadian National Railway until 1906. He was a broker and a director of Canadian Agencies Limited and Northern Supply Co., Ltd. Talbot was a business partner of Aim√© B√©nard. In 1913, he married Charlotte Duguet. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1914 provincial election, as a candidate of the Manitoba Liberal Party in La Verendrye. He lost to Conservative Jean-Baptiste Lauzon by 228 votes. He ran again in the 1915 election, and defeated Lauzon by 155 votes amid a provincial Liberal landslide. Talbot initially served as a backbench supporter of Tobias Norris's ministry, but later left the party to become an independent member over the Manitoba Schools question. He was re-elected as an independent in the 1920 provincial election, defeating Farmer candidate L.R. Magnum by 314 votes. He became affiliated with the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM) after this election, and was re-elected under the UFM banner in the 1922 provincial election. The UFM unexpectedly won a majority of seats, and formed government as the Progressive Party. Talbot was named as Speaker of the Legislature when it met on January 18, 1923, and continued in this office for the next thirteen years. Talbot was re-elected without difficulty in the 1927 provincial election. In 1932, the Progressive Party formed an electoral alliance with the Liberal Party, and government members became known as \\"Liberal-Progressives\\". Talbot was narrowly returned in the 1932 campaign, defeating Conservative R.J.E. Arpin by only 76 votes. He did not seek re-election in 1936.

However, it was ultimately concluded by the Senate Judiciary and the Conference Committee that the measure is constitutionally sound. Individuals would only be prosecuted if they engage in a pattern of activities intended to identify and expose covert agents, on the grounds that such actions goes beyond information that might contribute to informed public debate on foreign policy or foreign intelligence activities. The Conference Committee assured that U.S. intelligence critics would be beyond the reach of law so long as they do not actively seek to identify or expose covert agents.

It was a member of the Socialist International.Lamb, Peter; Docherty, James C. (2006). Historical Dictionary of Socialism (Second ed.). The Scarecrow Press. . P. 241Howard J. Wiarda, Harvey F. Kline, Latin American politics and development, Westview Press, 1990 ==History== The MIR was founded in 1971 by a merger of a left-wing faction of Bolivia's Christian Democratic Party and the radical student wing of the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR). It has been led from the beginning by Jaime Paz Zamora. The MIR was becoming influential in the labor movement and politics during the early 1970s, but it was repressed by the government of Hugo Banzer later in the 1970s. In 1978, the MIR joined the left-of-center UDP alliance of former president Hern√°n Siles Zuazo. After a few years of unstable military rule, Siles Zuazo was proclaimed Constitutional President in 1982, based on the results of the 1980 elections, which had been annulled by general Luis Garc√≠a Meza. The MIR's Jaime Paz Zamora accompanied Dr. Siles as his Vice-President. During the dire economic crisis that coincided with the coming to power of the UDP, Siles became considerably unpopular. At this point (1984), the MIR‚Äîled by Vice-President Paz Zamora‚Äîleft the governing alliance and moved into the opposition. Prior to the 1985 elections, a faction of the party led by Antonio Aran√≠bar left the party on ideological grounds and formed the rival Free Bolivia Movement. The faction of the MIR that remained loyal to Paz Zamora referred to itself as the MIR-New Majority, and espoused a much more moderate program than before, having disassociated itself from Marxist dogmas and any notion of class struggle. ===Presidency=== The MIR was revitalized when it became one of the most vocal critics of the austerity and neoliberal measures of the president that followed Siles, V√≠ctor Paz Estenssoro of the MNR. After the 1989 elections, the MIR at long last attained the presidency of Bolivia, despite having finished third in the popular vote. Since no party had obtained the 50% majority needed for direct election, Congress was called upon to decide who should be Chief Executive; Paz Zamora got the nod, thanks to a most unlikely alliance with a former enemy, the right-wing candidate General Hugo Banzer. Perhaps limited by this co-governing pact with Banzer (called the Patriotic Accord), President Jaime Paz Zamora followed much of the course set by the MNR, disappointing many former adherents. Like the other traditionally dominant parties in Bolivia (such as the MNR and Banzer's Nationalist Democratic Action, or ADN), the MIR has lost ground in recent years. One of its most important leaders, Oscar Eid, even went to jail for links to narcotics trafficking, further tarnishing the party. Indeed, the MIR lost so much support that it chose not to run candidates for the 2005 presidential elections. Instead, it chose to focus its efforts in local and provincial contests. They are not doing particularly well in that sphere either. The current leader of the MIR continues to be former President Jaime Paz Zamora, but the party's future is uncertain. ==References== Category:1971 establishments in Bolivia Category:Democratic socialist parties in South America Category:Former member parties of the Socialist International Category:Political parties established in 1971 Category:Political parties in Bolivia Category:Social democratic parties in South America Category:Socialist parties in Bolivia ","title":"Revolutionary Left Movement (Bolivia)"},{"id":"2221446","text":"The Niobe fritillary (Fabriciana niobe) is a species of butterfly in the family Nymphalidae. ==Etymology== The Latin species name niobe refers to Niobe, daughter of Tantalus in Greek mythology.Giuseppe Mazza ==Subspecies== Subspecies include: * F. n. niobe (central Europe and Western Siberia) * F. n. changaica Reuss, 1922 * F. n. demavendis (Gross & Ebert, 1975) (Iran) * F. n. gigantea (Staudinger, 1871) (southern Europe) * F. n. intermedia Reuss, 1925 * F. n. khusestana (Gross & Ebert, 1975) (western Iran) * F. n. kurana (Wyatt & Omoto, 1966) * F. n. orientalis (Alph√©raky, 1881) * F. n. ornata (Staudinger, 1901) * F. n. shiva (Wyatt & Omoto, 1966) * F. n. tekkensis (Christoph, 1893) * F. n. valesinoides Reuss, 1926 (Korea) * F. n. voraxides Reuss, 1921 ==Distribution and habitat== Fabriciana niobe is common throughout Europe, but absent from the United Kingdom and Northern Europe, and is also found in Siberia, Russia, Iran, China, and Korea Funet - Niobe Fritillary These butterflies can be found in open grassy places, slopes, woodland and clearings at altitudes between sea level and .Butterfly GuideFauna europaeaEuro Butterflies by Matt Rowlings ==Description== Niobe fritillary Fabriciana niobe has a wingspan of .

The Hillsboro-Silverton Highway continues further south to Silverton, signed as OR 214. The highway mainly serves local residents and agricultural traffic; despite its proximity to the Portland area it lies outside the Portland Urban Growth Boundary (except for its northern terminus in Hillsboro) and so maintains its character as a country road. ==Route description== OR 219's southern terminus is at the junction with Interstate 5 and OR 214 in the city of Woodburn. (A single diamond interchange serves both OR 219 and OR 214 from the freeway; OR 219 leads west of the interchange and OR 214 heads east.) After passing a collection of shopping malls and motel chains around the Woodburn exit, OR 219 starts winding its way through the Marion County countryside, heading in a northwesterly direction. As the area is primarily regular-platted farmland, the alignment of OR 219 heads west for a while, then turns north, then turns west again; the route contains numerous 90-degree turns. The next city encountered is the city of St. Paul. From St. Paul, the highway heads north and then northeast, parallel to (but at some distance from) the Willamette River. At this point the road is known as the St. Paul Highway.Anderson, David R. \\"Mean Streets: Nervous about holes in Oregon 219 to Newberg\\", The Oregonian April 27, 2006. After the intersections with McKay Road and Champeog Road (which provides access to Champoeg State Heritage Area), the route crosses the Willamette River. Soon after crossing the river, the highway enters the city of Newberg. In Newberg, the route intersects OR 18 (the Newberg-Dundee Bypass) before it joins (and overlaps) OR 99W along the Pacific Highway West No. 1W, and the combined route then heads westward into the city center (when one travels on the concurrent section, one is simultaneously heading north on OR 219 and south on OR 99W, or vice versa). In downtown Newberg, the route enters a one-way couplet; and then OR 219 splits apart from OR 99W again, and heads north. Immediately north of Newberg, the route enters a steep, narrow, twisty section as it climbs out of the Willamette Valley into the hills overlooking the town. Soon the road levels out again as OR 219 descends into the Tualatin Valley. The next named location is Scholls, where the route intersects with OR 210. Keeping on OR 219, one then heads in a general northwesterly direction, running parallel to the western bank of the Tualatin River. Just northwest of the intersection with OR 210 is Brown's Corner, followed by the 90 degree turn at the Midway Curve. The state plans to re-work those curves to improve safety. The highway as it enters Hillsboro across the Tualatin River After OR 210, the next major route encountered is OR 10, just west of Farmington.

Entering downtown Hillsboro, OR 219 becomes South 1st Street before ending at the intersection with Oregon Route 8, the Tualatin Valley Highway. Mile marker numbering begins here as zero, with numbers increasing as the road stretches to the south. OR 18 (the Newberg-Dundee Bypass) intersected Oregon Route 219 south of Newberg when it opens in Winter, 2018. ==History== In 1989, Washington County renamed the road in the county from Oregon 219 to Hillsboro Highway.Green, Ashbel S. \\"County set to change name of Oregon 219 Hillsboro Highway to be first of many such alterations\\", The Oregonian, October 3, 1989. This was part of an effort to improve response times by emergency services. One significant alignment change occurred during the 1990s. It used to be the case that OR 219, rather than running between St. Paul and Woodburn, instead continued south along French Prairie Road and River Road to Salem, Oregon, where it terminated in the northern part of Salem, near the Keizer city line at an intersection with the Salem Parkway (and, prior to the parkway's construction, down Broadway and High Streets to the corner of High Street and the Marion/Center Street street couplet downtown, where Highways 22 and 99E used to run). An extension of OR 214 connected Woodburn with St. Paul. However, that section of OR 219 is no longer marked as a state route.

It was the second basketball arcade game by Konami, following Super Basketball. Much of the game's popularity came from its animation sequences showing basketball players performing slam dunks, as well as \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" theme during attract mode, which was the first arcade game to feature the national anthem. These were uncommon in video games at the time of Double Dribble's release. While successful in the arcades, the game became and remained popular and remembered when it was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987. Double Dribble was followed by a sequel titled Double Dribble: The Playoff Edition, which was released in 1994 for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. A remake titled Double Dribble Fastbreak was released for iOS in 2010, being based mostly on the NES version; however, the animation sequences were ripped from the arcade version. ==Gameplay== Screenshot of the arcade version. ===Arcade Version=== Like its predecessor, Super Basketball, the player controls a five-man basketball team playing against the computer-controlled team, or controlled by a second player. When a coin is inserted, a credit is displayed on the bottom of the screen, along with a timer indicating one minute. The player is then prompted to enter their initials before starting the game. The gameplay is a marked difference and improvement from its predecessor, as the characters look and move better around the court. Like a traditional basketball game, the centers come out to the middle of the court, and the referee institutes a jump ball to begin the game. The goal for Double Dribble is for the player to have scored more points than the computer team before the time runs out. Doing so awarded the player with another minute of time, and the game continues. The long the game is played, the more difficult it becomes. If the computer team has as many points or more as the player's team when time runs out, the game ends. The controls are an 8-way joystick and three buttons: one to dribble the ball on offense, one to pass the ball on offense, and one to shoot the ball on offense. On defense, the dribble button becomes the steal button, the pass button becomes the switch button to switch players, and the shoot button becomes the jump button. If the player is on offense, they must repeatedly hit the dribble button while moving the joystick in a certain direction in order to move the character with the ball. To pass the ball, the player moves the joystick in the direction of the character's teammate (indicated by an aura in the player's team's color) and press the pass button. To shoot the ball, the player must press and hold the shoot button until the character reaches the top of their jump, at which point the button must be released. If the player controls a character in the lane and moving toward the basket and they hit the shot button, the screen changes to focus on the character attempting a dunk. The player must hold the button down until the character reaches the top of the jump and then release it. If the timing of the button's release is incorrect, the ball bounces high and far off the rim, and the player must rebound the ball. Each character moves at slightly different speeds, and is capable of jumping to different heights, and at different speeds. Learning the differences between each character's movement is important to performing jump shots, dunks, and also get good at rebounds, which is important at later stages of the game. If the player is on defense, the player can try to steal the ball from the computer by moving towards the ball and hitting the steal button. If done correctly, the player controlled character will steal the ball. The game then displays the message 'Nice steal!', and the player takes the offense role. There is a chance that while doing this that the player controlled character will foul the computer, who will then be sent to the free-throw line. If the player needs to switch control to a different player on their team, they move the joystick towards the preferred character and press the pass button. Control is instantly switched that character. When a character on the opposing team takes a shot, and the player controlled character is near to them, pressing the shot button will cause the player character to jump and possibly block the shot. If a shot is missed, moving the player character beneath the shadow of the ball and pressing the shot button executes an attempt to rebound the basketball. If the player character is fouled, he is sent to the free-throw line. Five characters will take their places on opposing sides of the lane, with the player character at the free-throw line. The player then has five seconds for each free throw attempt. A ring starts above the basket, and when the player presses and hold the shoot button, the ring descends towards the basket. The player must get the ring as close to the basket as possible in order to make the free throw. As with their jumps, each character's ring descends at different speeds. Like a real NBA game, the game is divided into four quarters at 12 minutes per quarter. After the end of each quarter there is a challenge stage, which is a three-point shootout. In these stages, the player controls a character from their team attempting five three-point shots at each corner, each wing, and from the top of the key for a total of 25 shots. The player presses and holds the shoot button until the character reaches the top of his jump, and then releases it. Each successful shot adds 1 second to the player's time remaining for a total of 25 seconds, with an additional bonus of 1 minute if all shots succeed. Play then continues until the player runs out of time while having fewer points than the opposing team, or the score is tied. The game's high-score table is unique, in that a player can get on the table by scoring a lot of points, shooting a high percentage either in-game or from the free-throw line, grabbing a lot of rebounds, dishing out assists, or by committing the fewest fouls. Players still have to score more points than the lowest score on the high score table to qualify, however. ===Nintendo Version=== Several positions on the court were 'hot spots,' high-percentage areas where shots were taken were likely to score points (e.g., \\"a fade-away, banked 3-pointer\\"). For example: it is easier to hit a 3-pointer on the bottom right-hand side of the screen. A player could start a 3-point jump shot from the top right or left corner of the court inbounds, and continue the jump out of bounds and even slightly behind the hoop and it would go in nearly every time. Another nearly guaranteed shot is taken with the player standing 3-quarters length of the court away from their goal could go for a running 3-point shot, provided that the shot button was pressed within the other team's free-throw shooting circle. In certain circumstances, the display would break away from the full court action and show a close-up of the players either dunking the ball or making a shot. Frequently a player would miss a slam dunk, which is a very high percentage shot. The arcade version was a timed play (much like Star Fire), where after every minute of play, the game was owed a credit if the score was tied or the computer is ahead. However, if the live player was ahead, a \\"free\\" minute was earned. Many average players could earn the first free minute, but this became increasingly more difficult to do as making 3-point shots became virtually impossible over the course of gameplay. Players can choose from one of four teams: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York. There is no difference in skill level or abilities between the teams. Since there is no NBA license, no team names or player names are used; however, the teams wear the same color of their NBA counterparts (Boston wears green, Chicago red, etc.). In short, the game control scheme is simple but it takes practice to get the hang of the timing scheme of the game. ===Notable Glitches=== Compared to many sports-related Nintendo games of this era, Double Dribble resembled its sport with surprising accuracy. However, there were several quirks in the programming that are noteworthy, if only for their contribution to the overall experience of playing Double Dribble. The game clock, as in most early timed video games (see also: Tecmo Bowl), was accelerated (far faster than real-time). In the third quarter, third is abbreviated as \\"3rt.\\" In addition, the color of a player's skin can change mid-game. This is the result of the strobing animation that takes place when controlling an individual player, which takes place by way of cycling quickly back and forth between the two skin tones. ==Ports and related releases== The game was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in September 1987, which was later released in Japan in Disk Card format for the Family Computer Disk System under the title of Exciting Basketball. The NES version features 5-on-5 action on a horizontally scrolling court, four teams (Boston Frogs, New York Eagles, Chicago Ox, Los Angeles Breakers), three levels of single-play difficulty, and four choices of quarter lengths. Double Dribble was among the first games to feature cut scenes, which depicted a mid-air player completing a slam dunk, and one of the first to use speech, though in a limited quantity (such as announcing the game title, the game's beginning jump ball, and some foul calls). \\"The Star- Spangled Banner\\" in this version was slightly altered, while it was being played in a cut scene depicting the crowd entering the stadium before the menu pops up. The NES version was ported to the Wii's Virtual Console in Europe on November 16, 2007, and in North America on November 26, 2007. In 1990, the game was ported to three home computers: the Commodore 64, the Commodore Amiga and MS-DOS operated PCs. In 1991, a Game Boy version was released titled Double Dribble 5-on-5. A Genesis sequel was released in 1994 titled Double Dribble: The Playoff Edition (Hyperdunk in Japan and Europe). A remake for iPhone OS titled Double Dribble Fast Break was released in 2010. ==Reception== Double Dribble has received mostly positive reception. In Japan, Game Machine listed Double Dribble on their March 15, 1987 issue as being the twentieth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Allgame awarded the game 5 out of 5 stars. The review referred to the game as the most realistic rendition of basketball on its release, and that it \\"was the beginning of a new era for sports games in which presentation played an increasingly important role. Once you get a glimpse of the innovative, cinema-style dunk attempts, there's no denying its place in history.\\" GameSpot editor Frank Provo displayed mixed feelings towards the game, emphasizing that after a few minutes of play time, players start noticing design quirks that force the player to play the game a certain way. Provo also criticized the computer player's unfair ability to catch up with the player. ==In popular culture== Gameplay of Double Dribble was featured in the Family Guy episode \\"Run, Chris, Run\\". The Double Dribble footage was slightly altered with original audio, and made fun of the game's \\"corner three\\" glitch. The episode also used gameplay footage from Tecmo Super Bowl, exploiting Bo Jackson's pace. ==References *Double Dribble Fast Break at Konami Play * *Double Dribble at arcade-history * Category:1986 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Arcade games Category:Basketball video games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Famicom Disk System games Category:Konami franchises Category:Konami games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:PlayChoice-10 games Category:Sports video games set in the United States Category:Tiger handheld games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual Console games Category:Konami arcade games ","title":"Double Dribble (video game)"},{"id":"2221470","text":"Richard Millington is a British birder and bird artist.

In 1980 he undertook a yearlist, at a time when this form of twitching was still in its infancy, seeing 300 species of bird in the wild in Britain throughout the course of the year, and his illustrated book A Twitcher's Diary catalogues his birding travels during that year. ==References== Category:English ornithologists Category:English nature writers Category:British bird artists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:English artists Category:People from Cley next the Sea ","title":"Richard Millington"},{"id":"2221476","text":"Dunvegan-Central Peace was a provincial electoral district in Alberta, Canada mandated to return a single member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta using the first-past-the-post method of voting from 2004 to 2012. Following the Alberta electoral boundary re-distribution of 2004, Dunvegan was the only division with a population of less than 75% the provincial average, with its recorded population of 24,202. It is thus formally designated as a special consideration division, as opposed to a standard rural division. Because of its isolation, the constituency meets criteria in the Albertan election laws allowing for this discrepancy. Until 2004, the district of Dunvegan, with almost the same boundaries.

The first election in the new district was hotly contested between Progressive Conservative Hector Goudreau and Dale Lueken from the Alberta Alliance. Lueken and Goudreau would face each other again in the 2008 general election. Goudreau easily held his seat and gained popular vote against Leuken. The construction of a nuclear power plant became a significant issue in that race.

It is a superset of the then-current CGA standard, using the same monitor standard and providing the same pixel resolutions. It was produced by Frederick Electronics, of Frederick, Maryland. The Colorplus has twice the memory of a standard CGA board (32k, compared to 16k). The additional memory can be used in graphics modes to double the color depth, giving two additional graphics modes‚Äî16 colors at 320√ó200 resolution, or 4 colors at 640√ó200 resolution. It uses the same Motorola MC6845 display controller as the previous MDA and CGA adapters. The original card also includes a parallel printer port. ==Output capabilities== CGA compatible modes: *160√ó100 16 color mode *320x200 in 4 colors from a 16 color hardware palette. Pixel aspect ratio of 1:1.2. *640√ó200 in 2 colors.

This offered greater clarity on RGB monitors, versus the default \\"thick\\" / 2-pixel font more suitable for output to composite monitors and over RF to televisions but, contrary to Plantronics' advertising claims, was drawn at the same 8x8 pixel resolution.) ==Software support== Few programs made use of these modes, for which there was no BIOS support. A 1984 advertisement listed as compatible software Color-It, UCSD P-system, Peachtree Graphics Language, Business Graphics System, Graph Power, The Draftsman, Videogram, Stock View and GSX. In addition, Canyon State Systems CompuShowhttp://cd.textfiles.com/clipart1996/UTILS/CSHOW860/ABOUT860.TXT supports the 320√ó200 mode. Planet X3, released by American YouTuber David \\"The 8-Bit Guy\\" Murray in 2019, is the only video game known to have Colorplus support. ==Hardware Clones== Some third-party CGA and EGA clones, such as the ATI Graphics Solution and the Paradise AutoSwitch EGA 480, could emulate the extra modes (usually describing them simply as 'Plantronics mode').

It is one of 87 mandated to return a single member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta using the first past the post method of voting. The electoral district was created in the 1993 boundary redistribution from the old Grande Prairie electoral district and significantly modified in the 2017 redistribution. The district and its antecedent have been a stronghold for conservative candidates in recent decades. The representative for this district is United Conservative Travis Toews. He won election for the first time in 2017. To date there have been four representatives who have held the district. The riding takes its name from the City of Grande Prairie and the Wapiti River. ==Geography== While a predominantly rural riding, Grande Prairie-Wapiti includes a few neighbourhoods on the east side of the City of Grande Prairie (including Cobblestone, Countryside, Crystal Heights, Crystal Landing, Hillside, Ivy Lake, and Smith). Four small towns are also located in the riding - Beaverlodge, Hythe, Sexsmith, and Wembley. The bulk of the riding's area is made up of rural municipalities, including almost all of the County of Grande Prairie No. 1 and a portion of the Municipal District of Greenview No. 16. The riding's Indigenous community includes the Horse Lake First Nation and the Wanyandie Flats East settlement of the unrecognized Aseniwuche Winewak Nation. Grande Prairie-Wapiti surrounds the riding of Grande Prairie and borders Central Peace-Notley to the north and east and West Yellowhead to the south. The riding's western boundary is the Alberta-British Columbia border. ==History== The electoral district was created in the 1993 boundary redistribution from the old Grande Prairie electoral district. It remained mostly unchanged in the 1997 and 2003 re-distributions. The Boundaries Commission proposed to abolish the district to create a completely urban Grande Prairie district but it changed its decision under public pressure. The 2010 distribution made minor changes to the border with Grande Prairie-Smoky in the city of Grande Prairie but stayed the same in the rural areas. ===Boundary history=== { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" !colspan=457 Grande Prairie-Wapiti 2003 Boundaries - !colspan=4Bordering Districts - !North !East !West !South - Dunvegan- Central Peace Grande Prairie-Smoky British Columbia boundary West Yellowhead - colspan=2 align=centerriding map goes here colspan=2 align=centerFile:Whereisgrandeprariewapiti.png - !colspan=4Legal description from the Statutes of Alberta 2003, Electoral Divisions Act. - colspan=4Starting at the intersection of the west boundary of the Province and the north boundary of Sec. 7 in Twp. 75, Rge. 13 W6; then 1. east along the north boundary of Secs. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 in the Twp. and the north boundary of Sec. 7 in Twp. 75, Rge. 12 W6 to the east boundary of the Sec.; 2. south along the east boundary to the north boundary of Sec. 5 in the Twp.; 3. east along the north boundary of Secs. 5, 4 and 3 in the Twp. to the eastboundary of Sec. 3 in the Twp.; 4. south along the east boundary to the north boundary of Twp. 74; 5. east along the north boundary to the east boundary of Sec. 2 in Twp. 75, Rge. 11 W6; 6. north along the east boundary to the north boundary of Sec. 12 in the Twp.; 7. east along the north boundary of Sec. 12 in Twp. 75, Rge. 11 W6 and east along the north boundary of Sec. 7, Rge. 10 in Twp. 75 to the east boundary of Sec. 18 in the Twp.; 8. north along the east boundary of Secs. 18 and 19 in the Twp. to the north boundary of Sec. 20 in the Twp.; 9. east along the north boundary of Secs. 20, 21 and 22 in the Twp. to the east boundary of Sec. 27 in the Twp.; 10. north along the east boundary to the north boundary of Sec. 26 in the Twp.; 11. east along the north boundary to the east boundary of Sec. 35 in the Twp.; 12. north along the east boundary to the north boundary of Twp. 75; 13. east along the north boundary to the east boundary of Sec. 33 in Twp. 75, Rge. 8 W6; 14. south along the east boundary of Secs. 33, 28, 21 and 16 in the Twp. to the north boundary of Sec. 10 in the Twp.; 15. east along the north boundary of Secs. 10, 11 and 12 in the Twp. and the north boundary of Secs. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 in Twp. 75, Rge. 7 W6 to the east boundary of Rge. 7 W6; 16. south along the east boundary to the north boundary of Twp. 72, Rge. 6 W6; 17. east along the north boundary of the Twp. to the intersection with the right bank of the Grande Prairie Creek; 18. downstream along the Grande Prairie Creek to the intersection with the Bear River; 19. downstream along the Bear River to the north Grande Prairie city boundary; 20. in a generally southerly, westerly and southerly direction along the city boundary to the centre line of 100 Avenue (Richmond Avenue); 21. east along the centre line of 100 Avenue to the Grande Prairie city boundary; 22. south and west along the city boundary to the centre line of the Alberta RailNet Inc.; 23. in a generally southerly direction along the centre line of the Alberta RailNet Inc. to the north boundary of Twp. 70; 24. east along the north boundary to the east boundary of Sec. 31 in Twp. 70, Rge. 5 W6; 25. south along the east boundary of Secs. 31, 30 and 19 in the Twp. to the right bank of the Wapiti River; 26. downstream along the right bank of the Wapiti River to the left bank of the Smoky River; 27. upstream along the left bank of the Smoky River to the north boundary of Twp. 58; 28. west along the north boundary to the west boundary of the Province; 29. north along the west boundary of the province to the starting point. - colspan=4Note: } { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" !colspan=462 Grande Prairie-Wapiti 2010 Boundaries - !colspan=4Bordering Districts - !North !East !West !South - Dunvegan- Central Peace-Notley Grande Prairie-Smoky British Columbia boundary West Yellowhead - colspan=2 align=center200px colspan=2 align=center200px - !colspan=4Legal description from the Statutes of Alberta 2010, Electoral Divisions Act. - colspan=4 - colspan=4Note: } ===Electoral history=== {  align=right !colspan=5Members of the Legislative Assembly for Grande Prairie-Wapiti - !Assembly !Years !colspan=\\"2\\"Member !Party - align=\\"center\\" colspan=5See Grande Prairie 1930-1993 - 23rd 1993‚Äì1997 rowspan=7  rowspan=2Wayne Jacques rowspan=7Progressive Conservative - 24th 1997‚Äì2001 - 25th 2001‚Äì2004 rowspan=2Gordon Graydon - 26th 2004‚Äì2008 - 27th 2008‚Äì2012 rowspan=4Wayne Drysdale - 28th 2012-2015 - rowspan=229th 2015‚Äì2017 - 2017-2019 rowspan=2  rowspan=2United Conservative - 30th 2019‚Äìpresent Travis Toews } The electoral district was created in the 1993 boundary redistribution from the old Grande Prairie district. The first representative elected in 1993 was Progressive Conservative candidate Wayne Jaques. He won a hotly contested race over Liberal candidate Dwight Logan to pick up the new district for his party. Jaques was re-elected in the 1997 election with a much larger margin. He retired from provincial politics in 2001. The second representative was Progressive Conservative was Gordon Graydon who won his first term in office in 2001 with a landslide over a field of five other candidates. He won a second term in the 2004 general election winning over half the popular vote. After the 2004 election Premier Ralph Klein appointed Graydon Minister of Gaming. He held that post until 2006. Graydon retired from provincial politics in 2008. The third representative is current Progressive Conservative MLA is Wayne Drysdale who was elected in the 2008 election for the first time. ==Election results1993 general election=== } ===1997 general election=== } ===2001 general election=== } ===2004 general election=== } ===2008 general election=2012 general election=2015 general election=2019 general election=Senate nominee results2004 Senate nominee election district results=== {  colspan=\\"5\\" align=center2004 Senate nominee election results: Grande Prairie-Wapiti colspan=\\"2\\"Turnout 43.52% - colspan=\\"2\\" Affiliation Candidate Votes % Votes % Ballots Rank Independent Link Byfield 2,127 11.08% 34.31% 4 Michael Roth 1,476 7.69% 23.81% 7 Vance Gough 1,346 7.01% 21.71% 8 Independent Tom Sindlinger 1,331 6.93% 21.47% 9 Gary Horan 1,306 6.81% 21.07% 10 - colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"right\\"Total Votes 19,198 colspan=\\"3\\"100% - colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"right\\"Total Ballots 6,200 colspan=\\"3\\"3.10 Votes Per Ballot - colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"right\\"Rejected, Spoiled and Declined colspan=\\"4\\"1,619 } Voters had the option of selecting 4 Candidates on the Ballot ===2012 Senate nominee election district results=Student Vote results2004 election=== {  align=right !Participating Schools - Beaverlodge Elementary School - Helleny Taylor School - Kateri Mission Catholic School - Saint Joseph Catholic High School - St. Gerrard School } On November 19, 2004 a Student Vote was conducted at participating Alberta schools to parallel the 2004 Alberta general election results. The vote was designed to educate students and simulate the electoral process for persons who have not yet reached the legal majority. The vote was conducted in 80 of the 83 provincial electoral districts with students voting for actual election candidates. Schools with a large student body that reside in another electoral district had the option to vote for candidates outside of the electoral district then where they were physically located. {   colspan=\\"5\\" align=\\"center\\"2004 Alberta Student Vote results - colspan=\\"2\\" Affiliation Candidate Votes % Allan Webber 193 18.22% NDP Jerry MacDonald 190 17.94% Liberal Cibylla Rakestraw 182 17.19% - colspan=\\"3\\" align =\\"right\\"Total 1,059 100% - colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"right\\"Rejected, Spoiled and Declined colspan=\\"2\\"36 } ===2012 election=== {  colspan=\\"5\\" align=center2012 Alberta Student Vote results - colspan=\\"2\\" Affiliation Candidate Votes % Liberal   % NDP Paula Anderson  % - colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"right\\"Total  100% } ==References== Category:Alberta provincial electoral districts Category:Grande Prairie ","title":"Grande Prairie-Wapiti"},{"id":"2221521","text":"Athletics has been contested at every Summer Olympics since the birth of the modern Olympic movement at the 1896 Summer Olympics. The athletics program traces its earliest roots to events used in the ancient Greek Olympics. The modern program includes track and field events, road running events, and racewalking events. Cross country running was also on the program in earlier editions but it was dropped after the 1924 Summer Olympics. == Events == The events contested have varied widely. From 1900 to 1920, tug of war was considered to be part of the Olympic athletics programme, although the sports of tug of war and athletics are now considered distinct.Past Olympic Sports. Olympics/IOC. Retrieved on 2010-08-30. === Men's events === No new events have been added to the men's athletics programme since the 1952 addition of the short racewalk. The roster of events has not changed since then, with the exception of the omission of the long racewalk in 1976 (the IAAF held a 50 km walk World Championships that year instead and as a result the event was restored in 1980). The long racewalk is the only event currently held for men but not included on the women's programme, with the exception of women taking part in the heptathlon rather than the decathlon and the 100 metres hurdles rather than the 110 metres hurdles. The last women's event added to the roster was the 3000 metres steeplechase in 2008. A total of 52 different events have been held in the men's competition. The current list comprises 24 events. Many of the discontinued events were similar to modern ones but at different lengths, especially in the steeplechasing, hurdling, and racewalking disciplines. Team racing events have been eliminated after appearing in six early editions of the Games. The athletic triathlon (an unusual event, held only once and featuring gymnasts competing in the long jump, shot put, and 100 metre dash) and pentathlon multi-discipline events were phased out in favor of the decathlon, and the medley relay replaced with even-leg relays. Standing jump competitions are no longer held, nor are the various modified throwing events which were experimented with in 1908 and 1912. Cross country running was on the program from 1912 to 1924 and is the most prominent form of athletics not to feature at the Olympics. {  -align=center colspan=31 align=center Current program -align=center !

Basically a picture refers to its object through a non-linguistic two-dimensional scheme. A picture is not writing or notation. A depictive two-dimensional scheme is called a picture plane and may be constructed according to descriptive geometry where they are usually divided between projections (orthogonal and various oblique angles) and perspectives (according to number of vanishing points). Pictures are made with various materials and techniques, such as painting, drawing, or prints (including photography and movies) mosaics, tapestries, stained glass, and collages of unusual and disparate elements. Occasionally, picture-like features may be recognised in simple inkblots, accidental stains, peculiar clouds or a glimpse of the moon, but these are special cases, and it is controversial whether they count as genuine instances of depiction.e.g. Robert Hopkins (1998), \\"Picture, Image, Experience\\" (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) p. 71. Similarly, sculpture and theatrical performances are sometimes said to depict, but this requires a broad understanding of 'depict', as simply designating a form of representation that is not linguistic or notational. The bulk of studies of depiction however deal only with pictures. While sculpture and performance clearly represent or refer, they do not strictly picture their objects. Objects pictured may be factual or fictional, literal or metaphorical, realistic or idealised and in various combination. Idealised depiction is also termed schematic or stylised and extends to icons, diagrams and maps. Classes or styles of picture may abstract their objects by degrees, conversely, establish degrees of the concrete (usually called, a little confusingly, figuration or figurative, since the 'figurative' is then often quite literal). Stylisation can lead to the fully abstract picture, where reference is only to conditions for a picture plane ‚Äì a severe exercise in self-reference and ultimately a sub-set of pattern. But just how pictures function remains controversial. Philosophers, art historians and critics, perceptual psychologists and other researchers in the arts and social sciences have contributed to the debate and many of the most influential contributions have been interdisciplinary. Some key positions are briefly surveyed below. == Resemblance == Traditionally, depiction is distinguished from denotative meaning by the presence of a mimetic element or resemblance. A picture resembles its object in a way a word or sound does not. Resemblance is no guarantee of depiction, obviously. Two pens may resemble one another but do not therefore depict each other. To say a picture resembles its object especially is only to say that its object is that which it especially resembles; which strictly begins with the picture itself. Indeed, since everything resembles something in some way, mere resemblance as a distinguishing trait is trivial. Moreover, depiction is no guarantee of resemblance to an object. A picture of a dragon does not resemble an actual dragon. So resemblance is not enough. Theories have tried either to set further conditions to the kind of resemblance necessary, or sought ways in which a notational system might allow such resemblance. It is widely believed that the problem with a resemblance theory of depiction is that resemblance is a symmetrical relation between terms (necessarily, if x resembles y, then y resembles x) while in contrast depiction is at best a non-symmetrical relation (it is not necessary that, if x depicts y, y depicts x). If this is right, then depiction and resemblance cannot be identified, and a resemblance theory of depiction is forced to offer a more complicated explanation, for example by relying on experienced resemblance instead, which clearly is an asymmetrical notion (that you experience x as resembling y does not mean you also experience y as resembling x).see e.g. Hopkins (1998), Christopher Peacocke (1987) 'Depiction', in Philosophical Review 96(3):383-410. Others have argued, however, that the concept of resemblance is not exclusively a relational notion, and so that the initial problem is merely apparent.John Hyman (2012), 'Depiction', in Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplement 71:129-150. In art history, the history of actual attempts to achieve resemblance in depictions is usually covered under the terms \\"realism\\", naturalism\\", or \\"illusionism\\". == Illusion == The most famous and elaborate case for resemblance modified by reference, is made by art historian Ernst Gombrich.Gombrich, E. H. (1960) Art and Illusion (Oxford: Phaidon Press).Gombrich, E. H. (1963) Meditations on a Hobbyhorse (Oxford, Phaidon Press).Gombrich, E. H. The Image and the Eye (Oxford and New York: Phaidon Press). Resemblance in pictures is taken to involve illusion. Instincts in visual perception are said to be triggered or alerted by pictures, even when we are rarely deceived. The eye supposedly cannot resist finding resemblances that accord with illusion. Resemblance is thus narrowed to something like the seeds of illusion. Against the one-way relation of reference Gombrich argues for a weaker or labile relation, inherited from substitution.Gombrich, E. H. (1960): pp 80-98, (1982): pp 278‚Äì297. Pictures are thus both more primitive and powerful than stricter reference. But whether a picture can deceive a little while it represents as much seems gravely compromised. Claims for innate dispositions in sight are also contested. Gombrich appeals to an array of psychological research from James J. Gibson, R. L. Gregory, John M. Kennedy, Konrad Lorenz, Ulric Neisser and others in arguing for an 'optical' basis to perspective, in particular (see also perspective (graphical). Subsequent cross-cultural studies in depictive competence and related studies in child-development and vision impairment are inconclusive at best. Gombrich's convictions have important implications for his popular history of art,Gombrich, E. H. (1995), The Story Of Art 16th ed. (London: Phaidon Press). for treatment and priorities there. In a later study by John Willats (1997)Willats, John, (1997), Art and Representation: New Principles In The Analysis Of Pictures (Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press.) on the variety and development of picture planes, Gombrich's views on the greater realism of perspective underpin many crucial findings.Gombrich (1995), pp. 133, 228. == Dual invariants == A more frankly behaviouristic view is taken by the perceptual psychologist James J. Gibson,Gibson, James J., 'The Ecological approach to Visual Perception in Pictures' Leonardo, 1978, 11, p.231. partly in response to Gombrich. Gibson treats visual perception as the eye registering necessary information for behaviour in a given environment. The information is filtered from light rays that meet the retina. The light is called the stimulus energy or sensation. The information consists of underlying patterns or 'invariants' for vital features to the environment. Gibson's view of depiction concerns the re- presentation of these invariants. In the case of illusions or trompe l'oeil, the picture also conveys the stimulus energy, but generally the experience is of perceiving two sets of invariants, one for the picture surface, another for the object pictured. He pointedly rejects any seeds of illusion or substitution and allows that a picture represents when two sets of invariants are displayed. But invariants tell us little more than that the resemblance is visible, dual invariants only that the terms of reference are the same as those for resemblance == Seeing-in == A similar duality is proposed by the philosopher of art Richard Wollheim. He calls it 'twofoldness'.Wollheim, Richard (1987), Painting as an Art (London: Thames and Hudson) pp 46-7, 72-5. Our experience of the picture surface is called the 'configurational' aspect, and our experience of the object depicted the 'recognitional'. Wollheim's main claim is that we are simultaneously aware of both the surface and the depicted object. The concept of twofoldness has been very influential in contemporary analytic aesthetics, especially in the writings of Dominic LopesLopes, Dominic (2005), Sight and Sensibility: Evaluating Pictures (Oxford: Clarendon Press). and of Bence Nanay.Nanay, Bence (2005), 'Is Twofoldness Necessary for Representational Seeing?', British Journal of Aesthetics 45(3): 263-272. Again, illusion is forestalled by the prominence of the picture surface where an object is depicted. Yet the object depicted quite simply is the picture surface under one reading, the surface indifferent to picture, another. The two are hardly compatible or simultaneous. Nor do they ensure a reference relation. Wollheim introduces the concept of 'seeing-in' to qualify depictive resemblance.Wollheim (1987), pp. 59-61. Seeing-in is a psychological disposition to detect a resemblance between certain surfaces, such as inkblots or accidental stains, etc. and three-dimensional objects. The eye is not deceived, but finds or projects some resemblance to the surface. This is not quite depiction, since the resemblance is only incidental to the surface. The surface does not strictly refer to such objects. Seeing-in is a necessary condition to depiction, and sufficient when in accordance with the maker's intentions, where these are clear from certain features to a picture. But seeing-in cannot really say in what way such surfaces resemble objects either, only specify where they perhaps first occur. Wollheim's account of how a resemblance is agreed or modified, whereby maker and user anticipate each other's roles, does not really explain how a resemblance refers, but rather when an agreed resemblance obtains. == Other psychological resources == The appeal to broader psychological factors in qualifying depictive resemblance is echoed in the theories of philosophers such as Robert Hopkins,Hopkins, Robert (1998), Picture, Image, and Experience (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press). Flint SchierSchier, Flint (1986), Deeper Into Pictures (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press). and Kendall Walton.Walton, Kendall (1990), Mimesis as Make-believe (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press). They enlist 'experience', 'recognition' and 'imagination' respectively. Each provides additional factors to an understanding or interpretation of pictorial reference, although none can explain how a picture resembles an object (if indeed it does), nor how this resemblance is then also a reference. For example, Schier returns to the contrast with language to try to identify a crucial difference in depictive competence. Understanding a pictorial style does not depend upon learning a vocabulary and syntax. Once grasped, a style allows the recognition of any object known to the user. Of course recognition allows a great deal more than that ‚Äì books teaching children to read often introduce them to many exotic creatures such as a kangaroo or armadillo through illustrations. Many fictions and caricatures are promptly recognised without prior acquaintance of either a particular style or the object in question.Ross, Stephanie (1971), 'Caricature', The Monist 58: pp 285-93. So competence cannot rely on a simple index or synonymy for objects and styles. Schier's conclusion that lack of syntax and semantics in reference then qualifies as depiction, leaves dance, architecture, animation, sculpture and music all sharing the same mode of reference. This perhaps points as much to limitations in a linguistic model. == Notation == Reversing orthodoxy, the philosopher Nelson GoodmanGoodman, Nelson (1968), Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols (Indianapolis and New York: The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Inc.). starts from reference and attempts to assimilate resemblance. He denies resemblance as either necessary or sufficient condition for depiction but surprisingly, allows that it arises and fluctuates as a matter of usage or familiarity.Goodman (1968), pp. 16-19. For Goodman, a picture denotes. Denotation is divided between description, covering writing and extending to more discursive notation including music and dance scores, to depiction at greatest remove. However, a word does not grow to resemble its object, no matter how familiar or preferred. To explain how a pictorial notation does, Goodman proposes an analogue system, consisting of undifferentiated characters, a density of syntax and semantics and relative repleteness of syntax. These requirements taken in combination mean that a one-way reference running from picture to object encounters a problem. If its semantics is undifferentiated, then the relation flows back from object to picture. Depiction can acquire resemblance but must surrender reference. This is a point tacitly acknowledged by Goodman, conceding firstly that density is the antithesis of notationGoodman (1968), p. 160. and later that lack of differentiation may actually permit resemblance.Goodman, Nelson and Elgin, Catherine Z, (1988) Reconceptions in Philosophy (London and New York: Routledge) p. 131. A denotation without notation lacks sense. Nevertheless, Goodman's framework is revisited by philosopher John KulvickiKulvicki, John (2006), On Images: Their structure and content (Oxford: Oxford University Press). and applied by art historian James ElkinsElkins, James (1999), The Domain of Images (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press). to an array of hybrid artefacts, combining picture, pattern and notation. == Pictorial semiotics == Pictorial semiotics aims for just the kind of integration of depiction with notation undertaken by Goodman, but fails to identify his requirements for syntax and semantics. It seeks to apply the model of structural linguistics, to reveal core meanings and permutations for pictures of all kinds, but stalls in identifying constituent elements of reference, or as semioticians prefer, 'signification'. Similarly, they accept resemblance although call it 'iconicity' (after Charles Sanders Peirce,Peirce, Charles Sanders - (1931-58), Collected Papers I-VIII. Hartshorne, C, Weiss, P, & Burks, A, (eds.) (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press). 1931‚Äì58) and are uncomfortable in qualifying its role. Older practitioners, such as Roland BarthesBarthes, Roland (1969), Elements of semiology (Paris, 1967) translated by Annette Lavers and Colin Smith, (London: Cape). and Umberto EcoEco, Umberto (1980), A Theory of Semiotics (Milan 1976) (Bloomington: Indiana University Press). variously shift analysis to underlying 'connotations' for an object depicted or concentrate on description of purported content at the expense of more medium-specific meaning. Essentially they establish a more general iconography.

(Lund: Aris/Lund University Press).Sonesson, G√∂ran (2001), 'Iconicity strikes back: the third generation ‚Äì or why Eco is still wrong'. VISIO 9: 3-4. rejects Goodman's terms for syntax and semantics as alien to linguistics, no more than an ideal and turns instead to the findings of perceptual psychologists, such as J. M. Kennedy,Kennedy, John M. (1974) The Psychology of Picture Perception (San Francisco, Jossey-Bass). N. H. FreemanFreeman, N. H. and Cox, M. V. (eds.)

(Republished in Husserliana X, The Hague: Nijhoff, 1966).Husserl, Edmund (1980), Phantasie, Bildbewusstsein, Erinnerung, Husserliana XXIII. (The Hague: Nijhoff). Resemblance is again grounded in optics or the visible, although this does not exclude writing nor reconcile resemblance with reference. Discussion tends to be restricted to the function of outlines in schemes for depth. ==Deixis== The art historian Norman BrysonBryson, Norman (1983) Vision and Painting: The Logic of The Gaz, (New Haven and London: Yale University Press). persists with a linguistic model and advances a detail of parsing and tense, 'deixis'. He rejects resemblance and illusion as incompatible with the ambiguities and interpretation available to pictures and is also critical of the inflexible nature of structuralist analysis. Deixis is taken as the rhetoric of the narrator, indicating the presence of the speaker in a discourse, a bodily or physical aspect as well as an explicit temporal dimension. In depiction this translates as a difference between 'The Gaze' where deixis is absent and 'The Glance' where it is present. Where present, details to materials indicate how long and in what way the depiction was made, where absent, a telling suppression or prolonging of the act. The distinction attempts to account for the 'plastic' or medium- specific qualities absent from earlier semiotic analyses and somewhat approximates the 'indexic' aspect to signs introduced by Peirce. Deixis offers a more elaborate account of the picture surface and broad differences to expression and application but cannot qualify resemblance. ==Iconography== Lastly, iconography is the study of pictorial content, mainly in art, and would seem to ignore the question of how to concentrate upon what. But iconography's findings take a rather recondite view of content, are often based on subtle literary, historical and cultural allusion and highlight a sharp difference in terms of resemblance, optical accuracy or intuitive illusion. Resemblance is hardly direct or spontaneous for the iconographer, reference rarely to the literal or singular. Visual perception here is subject to reflection and research, the object as much reference as referent. The distinguished art historian Erwin PanofskyPanofsky, Erwin (1955) Meaning in the Visual Arts (New York: Doubleday). allowed three levels to iconography. The first is 'natural' content, the object recognised or resembling without context, on a second level, a modifying historical and cultural context and at a third, deeper level, a fundamental structure or ideology (called iconology). He even ascribed the use of perspective a deep social meaning (1927). However more recently, a natural or neutral level tends to be abandoned as mythical. The cultural scholar W. J. T. MitchellMitchell, W. J. T. (1980), The Language of Images (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press).Mitchell, W. J. T. (1986), Iconology: Image, Text, Ideology, (Chicago and London: University Of Chicago Press).Mitchell, W. J. T. (1994), Picture Theory (Chicago and London: University Of Chicago Press). looks to ideology to determine resemblance and depiction as acknowledgement of shifts in relations there, albeit by an unspecified scheme or notation. Iconography points to differences in scope for a theory of depiction. Where stylistics and a basic object is nominated, resemblance is prominent, but where more elaborate objects are encountered, or terms for nature denied, simple perception or notation flounder. The difference corresponds somewhat to the division in philosophy between the analytic and continental. ==Other issues== Dozens of factors influence depictions and how they are represented. These include the equipment used to create the depiction, the creator‚Äôs intent, vantage point, mobility, proximity, publication format, among others, and, when dealing with human subjects, their potential desire for impression management. Other debates about the nature of depiction include the relationship between seeing something in a picture and seeing face to face, whether depictive representation is conventional, how understanding novel depictions is possible, the aesthetic and ethical value of depiction and the nature of realism in pictorial art. ==See also== * Figurative art * Representationalism * Symbol ==Further reading Books === *Barthes Roland (1969), Elements of semiology (Paris, 1967) translated by Annette Lavers and Colin Smith, (London: Cape). *Bryson Norman (1983) Vision and Painting: The Logic of The Gaze, (New Haven and London: Yale University Press). *Eco Umberto (1980), A Theory of Semiotics (Milan 1976) (Bloomington: Indiana University Press). *Elkins James (1999), The Domain of Images (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press). *Freeman N.

It is found in mountainous regions of southern and central Europe. Habitat in the Uri Alps ==Distribution== Mountain areas of Albania, Andorra, Austria, Great Britain, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Liechtenstein, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, Yugoslavia (Serbia, Kosovo, Voivodina, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia). Figures 2 and 2a ===Great Britain=== It is Britain's only true alpine species of butterfly. The larva feeds on moor matgrass near bogs and springs and the nectar-feeding adult visits bilberry, tormentil and heath bedstraw. ==Life history== The pale cream eggs are laid singly, each female laying up to 70. The egg stage lasts two or three weeks. The larva is green with a double dorsal and a single lateral white or yellowish line. The third instar larvae hibernate in grass tussocks. They emerge in the spring and recommence feeding. Some larvae spend two years in this stage, the result of a late spring and short summer restricting growth. Recorded larval food plants are Aira praecox (Czechoslovakia, Spain), Deschampsia cespitosa (Czechoslovakia), Festuca ovina (Spain), Nardus stricta (British Isles) and Poa annua (Spain) The pupa is formed deep in grass tussocks, encased within a loose silk structure. The pupa stage lasts about three weeks. The flight period is extremely short, a few weeks only, June to August depending on altitude. ==Description== Plate 77 Description in South (1906). ===Adult=== Wingspan . \\"The typical form of this butterfly, epiphron, Knock, has the tawny bands unbroken on the fore wings, and almost so on the hind wings; the black dots on the hind wings of the female are often pupilled with white, and more rarely this is so in the male also. It has been stated that specimens occur in Perthshire which exhibit these characters. All the British examples of the small mountain ringlet that I have seen are referable to the form known as cassiope, Fab. (Plate 77). The tawny, or orange, bands are rarely so entire on the fore wings as in epiphron, and are generally rather narrower; and that on the hind wing is broken up into three or four rings. The black dots are usually smaller and without white pupils. The female is somewhat larger and the bands or rings paler. Variation in the markings is extensive. The bands on the fore wings become less and less complete, until they are reduced to a series of mere rings around the black dots. The black dots decrease in size and in number until they, together with the tawny marking, entirely disappear, and a plain blackish-brown insect only remains. This extreme form has been named obsoleta, Tutt. The earliest rings to vanish seem to be the third on the fore wings and the first on the hind wings. Similar modifications occur on the underside also, but there may be an aberration on the upper side of a specimen, and not, or at least not in the same way, on the underside.\\" Plate 76 ===Early stages=== \\"The egg when first laid, is yellow, changing afterwards to fawn color with darker markings, especially towards the top. It is laid in July on blades of grass. The larva hatches in about sixteen days. The young caterpillar, before hibernation in October, is greenish, with darker green and yellow lines. Head brownish. Feeds in July and after hibernation on various grasses, among which Poa annua, Festuca ovina, Aira praecox, and A. caespitosa have been specified as eaten by caterpillars in confinement. A distinct preference, however, has been shown for mat grass (Nardus strictus), and it has been suggested that this may be the natural food. The full-grown caterpillar appears to be undescribed. The chrysalis is described by Buckler as being \\"little more than three-eighths of an inch in length, rather thick in proportion, being less dumpy in form than hyperanthtis, but more so than blandina [Erebia cethiops]. The color of the back of the thorax and wing cases is a light green, rather glaucous; the abdomen a pale drab or dirty whitish; a dark brown dorsal streak is conspicuous on the thorax, and there is the faintest possible indication of its being continued as a stripe along the abdomen. The eye-, trunk-, antenna-, and leg-cases are margined with dark brown, and the wing nervures are indicated by the same colors.\\" ==Subspecies== *Erebia epiphron epiphron Harz Mountains *Erebia epiphron aetheria Esper, 1805 *Erebia epiphron mackeri Fuchs, 1914 (synonym Erebia epiphron v√∂gesiaca Goltz, 1914) *Erebia epiphron mnemon Haworth, 1812 (synonym Erebia epiphron scotica Cooke, 1943) *Erebia epiphron orientpyreanica Eisner, 1946 (synonym Erebia epiphron fauveani) Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales *Erebia epiphron pyreanica Herrich-Schl√§ffer, 1851 *Erebia epiphron silasiana Meyer-D√ºr, 1852 *Erebia epiphron transylvanica Rebel, 1908 *Erebia epiphron retyezatensis Warren 1931 *Erebia epiphron roosi Arnscheid & Sterba *Erebia epiphron orientalis or Erebia orientalis Bulgaria *Erebia epiphron nelamus high altitude Hybrid Erebia serotina epiphron √ó Erebia pronoe ==References *Lepiforum Category:Erebia Category:Butterflies of Europe Category:Butterflies described in 1783 Category:Endangered species of the British Isles ","title":"Small mountain ringlet"},{"id":"2221538","text":"He Said, She Said is an American game show hosted by Joe Garagiola, with Bill Cullen occasionally filling in when Garagiola was covering baseball games. The show, which asked couples questions about their personal lives, aired in syndication during the 1969-1970 season, and was taped at NBC Studios in New York City. The show was produced by Goodson-Todman Productions for primary sponsor Holiday Inn (American Home Products, the makers of over-the-counter drugs such as Dristan and Anacin, also sponsored). Johnny Olson and Bill Wendell announced. The show had two formats during its run; one in which four celebrity couples (one or both of the members being a celebrity) competed, and one which had a single celebrity couple and three civilian couples. The format was modified and brought back on CBS in 1974 as Tattletales, with Bert Convy as host. ==Game play== Each team was given 100 points to begin the game (later they began with nothing). One member of each team (the men for the first half of the show, the women during the second half) were asked the questions, while the other member was taken to an off-stage room. Each could be seen and heard via a fake monitor that sat before each player using an electronic chroma key process; Garagiola communicated with them via an on-stage speaker phone. Garagiola read a statement (e.g., \\"How he shows affection\\"), and each contestant would have to raise his hand. The first three to raise their hands would say a one- or two-word answer, which Garagiola would ask them to explain. The answers would then be read one at a time over the phone, and the off-stage partner would have to ring in if she thought her partner had said it. If the first person to ring in was correct, the couple won 25 points. If she was wrong, the couple lost 10 points, as did the team which originally gave the answer. Each of the three answers would be read in random order.Typical contestant podia, with celebrities (left to right) Dick Clark, the husband of E. J. Peaker, Hal Holbrook and Bert Convy, who would later host Tattletales.Guest list from Radio-Info: \\"Retro: Carolina-Tennessee Monday, December 14, 1970\\", December 13, 2010. During the all-celebrity format, the off-stage partner would have to not only ring in for the correct answer, but also relate the same explanation or story about the answer as the on-stage partner to get the points; otherwise they lost 10 points. Each game consisted of four questions with the men and women switching positions halfway through the game. For the last question, only two people were allowed to raise their hands to answer. At the end of the game, the team(s) with the most points won $250 and a full week's stay at any Holiday Inn. The remaining couples would each win a $100 gift certificate redeemable at any Holiday Inn. The celebrity couple played for a designated couple in the audience which was revealed at the end of the show. In the all-celebrity format, each celebrity couple played for a different couple in the audience. ==Pilots1963=== The original pilot, titled It Had to Be You, was originally produced for NBC with Ed McMahon as host and had all-civilian couples. ===1969=== Among the episodes aired by GSN is the pilot for the 1969 series. The format features only one celebrity couple (Gene Rayburn and his wife Helen) playing against three civilian couples. The pilot exists as a black-and-white kinescope, although virtually all American television production had fully converted to color by this point. ===1971=== The 1971 pilot of the same name used a similar format. Round 1 was the same as what made it to air, only using dollars instead of points and buzzers instead of raising their hands. The remaining teams were given $400, $200, and $100 depending on where they finished. In Round 2, three questions were asked to each couple in the same manner as Tattletales - $50 each if all three matched, $100 if two matched, and $150 if only one matched. The two highest scorers moved on to Round 3, in which each member of the team was out on stage. Each of the four players got half the bank to bid on a question. Host Garagiola presented a question to one member of each team of the same gender. They wrote their answer on a card and then their partner gave a bid and an answer. If they were correct, they won their bid; if wrong, they lost it. The two players switched roles and repeated the process. The top scorer played the Big Match, a single question where each player wrote their answer on a card. If they matched, they drew from a hopper of balls with dollar amounts from $250 to $1,500 in $250 increments with two of each amount, for a possible total of $3,000. ==Proposal== The show was planned to be revived in Syndication for the Fall 2016Syndicators Busy With Shows For Next Fall season, but no distribution plans we made. ==Episode status== The show's status is unknown. Relatively few episodes of the series have been aired by GSN, mostly featuring more well known guests (including Sally Field). This includes the pilot which has survived only as a black-and-white 16mm film that was originally videotaped in color. On Valentine's Day 2016, Buzzr aired six episodes of the series as part of a marathon. The network also aired two episodes as part of the \\"Buzzr Secret Vault\\" on September 30, 2018. ==References== Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States Category:1960s American game shows Category:1969 American television series debuts Category:1970 American television series endings Category:1970s American game shows Category:Television series by Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions Category:Television series by Fremantle (company) ","title":"He Said, She Said (game show)"},{"id":"2221540","text":"The 1936‚Äì37 season was the 64th season of competitive football in Scotland and the 47th season of the Scottish Football League. == Scottish League Division One == Champions: Rangers Relegated: Dunfermline Athletic, Albion Rovers == Scottish League Division Two == Promoted: Ayr United, Greenock Morton == Scottish Cup == Celtic were winners of the Scottish Cup after a 2‚Äì1 final win over Aberdeen. == Other Honours  National === {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !width=160Competition !width=135Winner !width=80Score !width=135Runner- up - align=leftScottish Qualifying Cup ‚Äì North Vale Ocaba 4 ‚Äì 2second replay Keith - align=leftScottish Qualifying Cup ‚Äì South Duns 2‚Äì1 Galston } === County === {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !width=160Competition !width=135Winner !width=80Score !width=135Runner-up - align=leftAberdeenshire Cup Buckie Thistle 7 ‚Äì 2 * Aberdeen University - align=leftDumbartonshire Cup Dumbarton 2‚Äì0 Vale Ocaba - align=leftEast of Scotland Shield Hearts 6‚Äì2 Hibernian - align=leftFife Cup East Fife 1‚Äì0 Dunfermline Athletic - align=leftForfarshire Cup Arbroath 3 ‚Äì 1 # Brechin City - align=leftGlasgow Cup Rangers 6 ‚Äì 1 # Partick Thistle - align=leftLanarkshire Cup Motherwell 6 ‚Äì 1 * Airdrie - align=leftPerthshire Cup Breadalbane 4 ‚Äì 1 * Blairgowrie - align=leftRenfrewshire Cup Morton 1‚Äì0 St Mirren - align=leftSouthern Counties Cup Stranraer 2‚Äì1 St Cuthbert Wanderers - align=leftStirlingshire Cup Stenhousemuir 6 ‚Äì 4 * Alloa Athletic } * * ‚Äì aggregate over two legs * # ‚Äì replay === Highland League = Junior Cup == Arthurlie were winners of the Junior Cup after a 5‚Äì1 win over Kirkintilloch Rob Roy in the final. == Scotland national team == {  !Date !Venue !Opponents ! !Competition !Scotland scorer(s) -bgcolor=#ddffdd 14 October 1936 Ibrox Park, Glasgow (H)  align=center2‚Äì0 Friendly Jimmy Delaney (2) -bgcolor=#ddffdd 31 October 1936 Windsor Park, Belfast (A)  align=center3‚Äì1 BHC Charles Napier, Alex Munro, David McCulloch -bgcolor=#ffdddd 2 December 1936 Dens Park, Dundee (H)  align=center1‚Äì2 BHC Tommy Walker -bgcolor=#ddffdd 17 April 1937 Hampden Park, Glasgow (H)  align=center3‚Äì1 BHC Bob McPhail (2), Frank O'Donnell -bgcolor=#ffffdd 9 May 1937 Prater Stadium, Vienna (A)  align=center1‚Äì1 Friendly Frank O'Donnell -bgcolor=#ddffdd 22 May 1937 Stadion Sparta-Letna, Prague (A)  align=center3‚Äì1 Friendly James Simpson, Bob McPhail, Torry Gillick } Key: * (H) = Home match * (A) = Away match * BHC = British Home Championship == Notes and references  External links == * Scottish Football Historical Archive Category:Seasons in Scottish football ","title":"1936‚Äì37 in Scottish football"},{"id":"2221541","text":"The standard treatment, also known as the standard of care, is the medical treatment that is normally provided to people with a given condition.

After the clinical trial, researchers compare the outcomes of the two groups to see if the experimental treatment is better than, as good as or not as beneficial as the standard treatment. == Active (positive) concurrent control == In an active control or positive control trial, subjects are randomly assigned to the test treatment or to an active control treatment. Such clinical trials are usually double-blind, but this is not always possible; many oncology trials, for example, are considered difficult or impossible to blind because of different regimens, different routes of administration, and different toxicities. Active control trials can have two distinct objectives with respect to showing efficacy: (1) to show efficacy of the test treatment by showing it is as good as a known effective treatment or (2) to show efficacy by showing superiority of the test treatment to the active control. They may also be used with the primary objective of comparing the efficacy and/or safety of the two treatments. Whether the purpose of the trial is to show efficacy of the new treatment or to compare two treatments, the question of whether the trial would be capable of distinguishing effective from less effective or ineffective treatments is critical. ==See also== *Drug development *New drug application *U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) *European Medicines Agency *International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Category:Clinical research Category:Pharmaceutical industry Category:Design of experiments ","title":"Standard treatment"},{"id":"2221552","text":"View of the Morro Jable beach Jand√≠a: View from Morro Jable to the lighthouse of Jand√≠a Playa Jand√≠a is a peninsula in the southwestern part of the island of Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands.

He became particularly well known for his buildings and structures in Athens and Vienna, and is considered an outstanding representative of Neoclassicism and Historicism. ==Biography== Hansen was born in Copenhagen. After training with Prussian architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel and some years studying in Vienna, he moved to Athens in 1837, where he studied architecture and design, with a concentration and interest in Byzantine architecture. During his stay in Athens, Hansen designed his first building, the National Observatory of Athens and two of the three contiguous buildings forming the so-called \\"Athenian Trilogy\\": the Academy of Athens and the National Library of Greece, the third building of the trilogy being the National and Capodistrian University of Athens, which was designed by his brother Hans Christian Hansen (1803‚Äì1883). The Greek-Austrian entrepreneur Georgios Sinas (1783-1856, who donated the observatory, called Hansen to Vienna in 1846, where Hansen took up an apprenticeship with noted Austrian architect Ludwig F√∂rster (1797‚Äì1863). In his early works, such as the museum at The Arsenal in Vienna, Hansen was still rather aligned to a more romantic style. In later years, he became the most outstanding representative of Renaissance-inspired historicism (Neo-Renaissance), which also came to be known as Viennese-style. This style extended into the smallest details of the interior design and partially accepted the courses of a synthesis of the arts. Along with F√∂rster and many others, Hansen was one of the most important and influential architects of the Viennese Ringstra√üe. His most famous work is the Austrian Parliament building, which was created in the style of an ancient, neo-classic temple, and serves to refer to the Greek beginnings of democracy. Hansen was originally a staunch critic of the Classical style that was taught to him at the Copenhagen Academy. Over the years, however, he came to incorporate Classical elements into his forms. Bauleiter on this project was Swiss-Austrian architect Hans Auer (1847‚Äì1906) who would go on to win the competition for the Swiss Bundeshaus. Hansen's famed Musikverein in Vienna is one of the most notable concert halls in the world; a concert hall whose design and acoustics are often admired and copied in present-day music houses. Academy of Athens, next to the University of Athens and the National Library (not shown) forming \\"the Athenian Trilogy\\". The Academy and the University buildings were designed by Theophil Hansen (1885) in Greek Ionic, academically correct even to the polychrome sculpture. The statues and columns were worked by Leonidas Drosis. Hansen worked together with Austrian sculptor Vincenz Pilz (1816-1896) and artist Carl Rahl (1812‚Äì1865), as well as with architect Otto Wagner (1841-1918). In 1884 Emperor Franz Joseph honoured Hansen with a barony in the Austrian nobility and he was since styled \\"Freiherr von Hansen\\". He died in 1891 in Vienna. ==Work== * National Observatory of Athens, 1842 * House of military invalids, Lviv, 1851-1863 * Academy of Athens, Athens, starting from 1856 * Museum of Military History in the Arsenal, Vienna, 1856 * Old Municipal Hospital in Patras, Greece, 1857 * Cemetery chapel Christuskirche at the Matzleinsdorf Protestant Cemetery, Vienna, 1858 * Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, Vienna, 1858‚Äì1861 * Palais Todesco, Ringstrasse, Vienna, 1861-1864 * Palace of Archduke Wilhelm, Vienna, 1864‚Äì1868 * Musikverein, Vienna, 1867‚Äì1870 * Academy of Fine Arts Vienna, 1871‚Äì1876 * Philharmonic Concert Hall, Brno, 1871‚Äì1873 * Vienna Stock Exchange, 1874‚Äì1877 * Austrian Parliament Building, Vienna, 1874‚Äì1883 * Zappeion, Athens, 1874-1888 * New Lutheran church, Ke≈æmarok, 1879-1892 * Castle Nadelburg, Lichtenw√∂rth, Lower Austria 1880-1882 * National Library of Greece, Athens, starting from 1888 ==Gallery== 07Athen Observatorium1.jpg Athens Observatorium Attica 06-13 Athens 28 Academy of Athens.jpgAcademy of Athens part of the 'Athenian Trilogy' in Athens Wien - Haus des Wiener Musikvereins (1).JPGMusikverein building in Vienna Musikverein Goldener Saal.jpgGoldener Saal in the Musikvereinsgeb√§ude in Vienna Athens_Zappeion.jpgThe Zappeion Megaron in Athens Castle-nadelburg.jpgCastle Nadelburg in Lichtenw√∂rth, Lower Austria Wien parlament.JPGReichsrat in Vienna, today the Austrian Parliament Building Palais_Hansen_Wien_2010_2.jpgPalais Hansen in Vienna Attica 06-13 Athens 32 National Library.jpgNational Library of Greece Kezmarok11.jpgNew Lutheran church in Ke≈æmarok ==References Other sources == * George Niemann (Hrsg.), Ferdinand von Feldegg: Theophilus Hansen und seine Werke.

In a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy (\\"Reorganization\\") the trustee is responsible for receiving the debtor's monthly payments and distributing those funds proportionally to the debtor's creditors. The Bankruptcy Trustee will act on behalf of the debtor to guarantee that both the creditors‚Äô and the debtor's interests are maintained in accordance with the bankruptcy laws, and will often be required to act as a negotiator between the two parties. Since the 1990s, duties similar to those of a trustee are sometimes performed by an individual called a Chief restructuring officer (CRO), generally prior to, or subsequent to, a bankruptcy proceeding (generally, a Chapter 11 proceeding). A CRO is an official of the company who has direct contact with the creditors and who has executive power to implement changes. The advantage of using a CRO is that the arrangement gives both the creditor and debtor more say over the future of the company than might be the case where a Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee is appointed. == See also == *Receiver (legal) ==References External links == *National Association of Bankruptcy Trustees *DOJ U.S. Trustee Program Category:Legal professions Category:United States bankruptcy law Category:Insolvency da:Kurator ","title":"Trustee in bankruptcy"},{"id":"2221584","text":"A 17th-century Brewster Chair A Brewster Chair is a style of turned chair made in mid-17th-century (\\"Pilgrim Century\\") New England, United States. ==Origin== The \\"Brewster Chair\\" was named after Willam Brewster, one of the Pilgrim fathers who landed in Plymouth, Massachusetts in 1620.

Section 16.1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is the newest section of the Charter. It was enacted by the Constitution Amendment, 1993 (New Brunswick) and guarantees equality between English-speaking and French-speaking New Brunswickers. Section 16.1 (pronounced \\"sixteen point one\\") is not to be confused with subsection 16(1) (\\"sixteen one\\"), which is part of section 16 and goes back to 1982. Section 16.1 is a separate section;Hogg, Peter W. Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), p. 1214 the \\"point one\\" numbering simply indicates that at some time (i.e. in 1993) an amendment inserted this new section between two existing sections without renumbering them. ==Text== The section reads, ==Purpose== Section 16.1 makes reference to a need for institutions for both language groups, including educational institutions, and it seemingly gives the provincial government powers to protect the right.Deborah Coyne, \\"New Brunswick amendment has fundamental flaw,\\" The Gazette, Montreal, Quebec: January 13, 1993. pg. B.3. This is not completely revolutionary in that this merely entrenches laws already found in An Act Recognizing the Equality of the Two Official Linguistic Communities in New Brunswick (1981), as noted in the 2001 Court of Appeal case Charlebois v. Mowat. The section can be seen as providing \\"collective rights,\\" and one critic charged that a deeper meaning to the section would have to be decided by Canadian courts.William Johnson, \\"Unseemly haste to amend constitution without debate,\\" The Hamilton Spectator. Hamilton, Ontario: February 4, 1993. pg. A.7 In Charlebois v. Mowat, the court ruled that section 16.1, as well as subsections 16(2) and 18(2), require bilingual municipal laws when the minority language population of a municipality is significant. The ruling was made primarily on the basis of the court's interpretation of subsection 18(2)), but in its ruling the court also stated that section 16.1 is \\"remedial\\", meaning that it is supposed to fix historical problems.CanLII - 2001 NBCA 117 (CanLII) (A related case later went to the Supreme Court as Charlebois v. Saint John (City).) ==History== An Act Recognizing the Equality of the Two Official Linguistic Communities in New Brunswickoriginally SNB 1981, c O-1.1 was enacted in 1981 by Premier Richard Hatfield. It provided independent school boards for both linguistic groups. Its principles were later incorporated into the Constitution of Canada, through section 16.1, in response to a shift in provincial politics in the early 1990s. Whereas in the 1980s all parties had supported the rise of bilingualism in New Brunswick, in 1991 a new party called the Confederation of Regions Party, which was opposed to official bilingualism, became the official opposition in the legislature. The pro-bilingualism Liberal provincial government proceeded to seek a constitutional amendment mandating bilingualism in New Brunswick to make any future change in New Brunswick's status subject to Federal approval.Dyck, Rand. Canadian Politics: Critical Approaches. Third ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Nelson Thomson Learning, 2000), p. 95. The constitutionalization of the legislation was originally meant to be accomplished as part of a package of amendments known as the Charlottetown Accord in 1992. The amendment was made separately once the Accord was rejected in a national referendum, prompting Professor Peter Russell to refer to this as an \\"encouraging [sign] that Canadians may be recovering the capacity to accomplish constitutional reform without linking everything together and getting bogged down in the mega constitutional swamp.\\"Russell, Peter. Constitutional Odyssey, 2nd ed. (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1993), p. 231. Section 43 of the Constitution Act, 1982 was the part of the amending formula used to add section 16.1 to the Charter. This meant the amendment was approved by the province affected (New Brunswick) and the Senate of Canada and House of Commons of Canada, although constitutional lawyer Deborah Coyne argued that the amendment involved federal jurisdiction and thus seven provinces would be needed. The House of Commons passed the amendment with a vote of 219-2, on February 1, 1993.http://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.HOC_3403_132_03/485?r=0&s;=1 A Montreal Gazette article approved, calling the New Brunswick government \\"courageous\\" because of its resistance to the Confederation of Regions Party, and added that the section provided a \\"noble, generous vision of Canadian duality and co-existence. Too bad it seems confined to New Brunswick.\\"\\"New Brunswick leads the way,\\" The Gazette. Montreal, Quebec: December 4, 1992. pg. B.2. It did attract some criticism, with columnist William Johnson claiming that Parliament had not fully analyzed the amendment and tried to stifle public discussion. He even suggested that section 16.1 might create two governments for New Brunswick, one in English and one in French. Earlier, this columnist had also charged that enshrining collective rights in the Constitution was \\"alien to liberalism,\\" and would undermine the individual in favour of a larger group; he also said section 16.1 excluded Aboriginal peoples in New Brunswick and could make them \\"second-class citizens.\\" He compared section 16.1 to how the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord would have recognized Quebec as a distinct society.William Johnson, \\"New Brunswick amendment tramples individual rights,\\" The Gazette. Montreal, Quebec: January 16, 1993. pg. B.5. However, Opposition leader Jean Chr√©tien, who at that time represented Acadians, said that \\"For me it is a great day.

In 2000, an Ontario court ruled that the province was legally obligated to keep from closing the Montfort Hospital as part of its program of merging many of the hospitals in the Ottawa region. The basis for the decision was the court's conclusion that this was a logical application of an unwritten constitutional principle of minority rights, which had been found by the Supreme Court in the 1998 Reference re Secession of Quebec. Since the Montfort Hospital was the only hospital in the region operating primarily in French, it amounted to a protected parallel service-provider, much as New Brunswick's French-language and English-language school systems are parallel service providers, and therefore as an essential component of the collective rights of Ottawa's Franco-Ontarian population. The Government of Ontario criticized the decision as judicial activism, and charged that \\"The divisional court decision has effectively rewritten the constitution to make [Section] 16.1 applicable to Ontario despite the express intention that it apply to New Brunswick alone.\\"Wills, Terrance. ‚ÄúEnglish will do: Ontario: Franco-Ontarians‚Äô plight not our problem: Harris.‚Äù The Gazette.

Built for CenTrust Bank in 1987, the 47-story building ranks in the top twenty tallest skyscrapers in Miami and in Florida at a height of and is known for its elaborate night-time illuminations and its dramatic three glass tiers. Designed by the Pei Cobb Freed & Partners architectural firm, the tower consists of two separate structures: A 10-story parking garage owned by the city and the 47-story office tower built upon the air rights of the garage. Preliminary planning for the tower began in February 1980; construction on the garage began by November. The garage was completed in February 1983 and the tower began construction a year later. On August 1984, while the tower was under construction, a 5-alarm fire began on the ninth floor; construction was subsequently delayed for several weeks. On December 15, 1985, the tower was lit for the first time in Miami Dolphins aqua and snowflakes. By mid-1986, the tower's exterior was complete and the grand opening for the complex was set for early fall that same year. Due to the uneven settling of the tower's foundation to one side by several inches, and the resulting misalignment of the tower's elevator rails, the grand opening for the complex was delayed until February 1987. The complete complex featured the world's only elevated metro station in a skyscraper (Knight Center station). It also gained notoriety for its luxurious interiors, including a skylobby on the 11th floor covered in marble and gold and a outdoor terrace. Also its indoor gym features mahogany cabinets. The tower is connected to the James L. Knight Center by a pedestrian walkway and on the first floor is a retail spine covered with green marble. The tower contains with of office space and a , 1,500 space parking garage. The tower can be seen in the \\"Streetwise\\" episode of Miami Vice which aired on December 5, 1986. The building appears during the end credits of the 1986 film Flight Of The Navigator in an aerial shot of Miami. The top floors can clearly be seen still under construction. The roof of the building was the set of Gloria Estefan's 1994 video for \\"Turn The Beat Around\\". The building is also one of many featured on the backdrop of the stage on The Tonight Show. On January 1, 2010, the building was renamed the Miami Tower.http://www.plumtv.com/blogs/miami- insider/bank-of-america-tower-renamed-miami-towers ==Many colors of the tower== The tower's three tiers allow it to have multiple color schemes in tribute to certain holidays and seasons.

The Arboretum‚Äôs collections include nearly 1,700 accessioned woody plants and about 25,000 total plants, comprising trees, shrubs, and perennial and annual plantings laid out in the manner of European gardens. Many plantings date back to the 1920s. Recently the Arboretum has focused on increasing the diversity of woody plants and developing demonstration gardens including a lilac garden, perennial walkway, native plant garden, and labyrinth. Perennial gardens feature daylilies, purple coneflowers, and daisies; the annual flower displays include a yearly planting of some 7,000 spring bulbs including tulips and daffodils, as well as approximately 5,000 annuals and 1,500 chrysanthemums. In addition, the Kingman Museum, a natural history museum and planetarium, is located on the Arboretum grounds. The Leila Arboretum dates back to 1922 when Leila Post Montgomery, widow of breakfast cereal magnate C. W.

May is one of the historic Nashville figures whose likenesses were created by artist Red Grooms for the Tennessee Foxtrot Carousel in Nashville. May was active in the Nashville desegregation effort of the 1950s. In The Jews in America, Arthur Hertzberg wrote, > In Nashville, Tennessee, Dan May, a leading industrialist, was chairman of > the school board in 1954, and he took the lead in fostering a plan for > integrating the public schools, one grade at a time. This modest suggestion > did not endear him to the local racists, and he had to be guarded by police > for a while. May became chairman of the May Hosiery Mills (subsequently part of the Wayne- Gossard Corp.) in Nashville after the death of his father, Jacob May (1861-1946), who founded the company. In Mortimer May, Foot soldier in Zion, the 1965 biography of May's brother Mortimer, Sam Shankman summarized Dan May's civic involvement: :Daniel [May] devoted himself assiduously to the labor of a modern industrialist, mainly to the management of a large hosiery manufacturing enterprise, yet finding time for myriad activity in civic and communal endeavor. :Daniel May served during World War II in the War Production Board. He was for long years a member of the Nashville Board of Education and its chairman for three years. He was elected a magistrate of Davidson County in 1954 and continues in that position. In this capacity he has maintained his interest in education as chairman of the school committee of the County Court which governs the working of the county school system. He was a member of the Board of Trust of Fisk University for many years. He has been a Trustee of Vanderbilt University, his Alma Mater, for more than a decade. :At the moment he is President of the Nashville Rotary Club, the first time such honor has come to a Jew. He has labored strenuously for consolidated city and county government. When it was adopted, he ran for the Metropolitan Council; of 89 candidates seeking the five council seats at-large, he received the greatest number of votes. :In the Jewish community he has been president of the Jewish Community Center and of the Community Council, and he has served as general chairman of the Welfare Fund on two occasions. He has ever been concerned with better understanding between groups in the community complex, and has played a substantial role in promoting wholesome relations between religious and racial segments. On many agencies his has been a positive and constructive voice for Negro rights and progress in which Nashville has been in the van of Southern communities. ==Noted family members== * May was the father of radio DJ Jack May (a.k.a. \\"Candied Yam Jackson\\"), known for originating the phrase \\"screw the pooch.\\" * May was related to infamous gangster Dutch Schultz, born Arthur Flegenheimer. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *\\"Daniel May Papers, 1890-1982\\" from the Tennessee State Archives, available on microfilm (Mf. 1167‚Äì2200 items.

In Germany, the map was only locally represented until the 1930s, from the middle of the century it was already widespread and in places frequently encountered. In the second half of the 20th century it spread in Germany to the north and west across Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein and the Netherlands to the North Sea coast. Already 1881 it was present in Jutland (Denmark). In 1955, the northern distribution limit of indigenous Danish populations was Falster, Lolland and Zealand. It reached Sweden in the 1970s, and in 1973 it was first seen in Finland. A. levana was found on May 30, 1973, in southeastern Finland, in Lauritsala, by a young lepidopterist, Mr Jouko E. Hokka. The specimen was the first known A. levana in northern Europe, excluding Denmark. Since 1983, the map has been established in Finland and has since steadily increased its area. In the UK this species is a very rare vagrant, but there have also been several unsuccessful ‚Äì and now illegal ‚Äì attempts at introducing this species over the past 100 years or so: in the Wye Valley in 1912, the Wyre Forest in the 1920s, South Devon 1942, Worcester 1960s, Cheshire 1970s, South Midlands 1990s. All these introductions failed and eggs or larvae have never been recorded in the wild in the UK. (Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 it is now illegal to release a non-native species into the wild.) Seitz Plate 64 ==Description in Seitz== A. levana L. (64d) has on a reddish ochreous ground a characteristic pattern of spots, some whitish subapical and distomarginal spots on the forewing and a row of blue bars near the distal margin of the hindwing. The underside of the forewing on the whole agrees with the upper, but the apical area bears violet dusting, the ground-colour is paler, and there are sharply defined white lines at the cell- spots; the hindwing is for the greater part red-brown, bearing in the centre a pale transverse band which widens behind, in places light lines traverse the wing and there is a dull violet smear in the distal area; the margin of both wings bears thin black lines. This is the first brood, which flies early in the spring (April‚ÄîMay). There occur among the ordinary form occasionally specimens in which the black basal and costal markings are confluent and both wings dark-margined, while the other markings of the wings (in the centre) are quite or nearly obsolete, these areas therefore being nearly uniformly red- brown. This is ab. frivaldszkyi Aigner. The summer-brood (July till August), sometimes also a third brood (September‚ÄîOctober), is essentially different, being known as ab. prorsa L. (64d). Black, the forewing with white spots, the hindwing with a white transverse band; for the greater part red-brown beneath, with whitish lines and bands. On the upperside there appear vestiges of reddish yellow lines at the distal margin; specimens in which these lines are absent or only in places slightly indicated, while the white markings are narrowed, are ab. obscura Fruhst. (64f). If the white marking is narrowed to a yellowish stripe, or if the hindwing is entirely black, the name ab. schultzi Pfitzn. may be employed. Specimens in which the upperside is entirely without white bands, the small spots in the distal area being either present or absent, have been named ab. weismanni Fisch. (artificially produced). On the other hand the individuals with the bands partly yellowish and the reddish yellow distal markings strongly developed may be named ab. intermedia form. nov. (64d); not rare in nature, being especially frequent in wet and cold summers. It forms the transition to ab. porima O. (64d) which is already so much changed in the direction of the spring-brood that the reddish yellow colour in the distal area forms the ground-colour, the bands of prorsa, however, still being visible. Finally, ab. diluta Spul. is an artificially produced variety which resembles porima, but the forewing has an archaic Nymphalidian character in the row of spots recalling the ocelli found in the Satyrids. All these forms are connected by intergradations, prorsa being considered the more recent form, which can be changed by the application of cold into levana (the ancestral form), while the inverse does not take place. ‚Äî The egg of the species is ovate, flattened above, ribbed, of a greenish colour. The larva feeds on Urtica dioica gregariously; it is black or pale brown with black stripes, sometimes with a reddish side-line, armed with short branched thorns, which are black, sometimes yellow. Pupa brown, spotted with blackish, the projections of the head and back obtuse, sometimes with metallic spots. The pupa of the last brood hibernates. The species is distributed over Central and East Europe (except England) southward to Dalmatia, through Armenia, Siberia, Amurland, Ussuri, Corea to Japan (here apparently in 3 broods), the varieties recurring in the East without showing any striking or constant differences from those of the West.Stichel, H. in Seitz, A. ed.

The summer brood are black with white markings, looking like a miniature version of the white admiral and lacking most of the orange of the pictured spring brood. ==Biology== The eggs are laid in long strings, one on top of the other, on the underside of stinging nettles, the larval food plant. It is thought that these strings of eggs mimic the flowers of the nettles, thereby evading predators. The larvae feed gregariously and hibernate as pupae.

It is the last spur on the Cordillera Preb√©tica Mountain Range and is located in the Marina Alta region in the north of Alicante between the towns of D√©nia and X√†bia. The mountain rises dramatically from the valley floors surrounding it and dominates the skyline for miles around. Its craggy cliffs are home to some of the most unusual flora and fauna in Spain. The mountain is renowned for its rock formations, cliffs, caves and natural harbours. From the X√†bia side Montg√≥ is often said to resemble the head and trunk of an elephant. The mountain can be easily reached by highway CV-736 which links Denia with J√°vea, both of which are accessible via the AP-7 motorway or the N-332 national highway. ==Montg√≥ Nature Reserve == The Montg√≥ Nature Reserve encompasses 2150 hectares (5312 acres) around the mountain. It includes a coastal section that covers over . The Reserve contains important archaeological finds such as cave paintings, Phoenician amphoras and the remains of Iberian settlements. Because of its extraordinary wealth of flora, fauna and ecosystems the park was declared an officially protected nature reserve in 1987. The reserve runs almost parallel to the coastline, joining the coastal area via a flat area known as ‚Äòles Planes‚Äô which ends at Cap de San Antoni.http://www.porlibre.com/VALENCIA/montgo.htm == Formation of the Montg√≥ == The mountain was formed during the Cretaceous period, some 70 million years ago, when plate tectonic processes forced the African and European continental plates upwards, creating spectacular mountainous landscapes such as that of the Montg√≥. Over the next few million years, strong erosion and rock slides sculpted it to the shape it has today. The geological composition of this Nature Reserve is characterized by Cretaceous materials. On the lower parts, marl and marlaceous lime abound, while the escarpments are formed by compact limestone. == Flora and faunaFlora=== The geology and climate of the Montg√≥ has fostered more than 650 species of flora. The primitive Mediterranean oak, which once dominated the mountain before over-exploitation by man, is still present, as is Mount Atlas Pistachio, rosemary, white hellebore, rock lavender, marine juniper and cistus. In the higher more humid areas there are a number of endemic plants such as the Hippocrepis Valentina and the Valencian rock violet, as well as the blue Mediterranean fan palm (usually seen in the plains), the only palm species to grow wild in Europe. In addition, the Carduncellus Dianius or ‚ÄòHierba Santa‚Äô as it is known in Spanish, is unique and only found here and in Ibiza. The Montg√≥ flora also includes Kermes oak groves dotted with mastic trees and rhamnnus alaternus, as well as the Mediterranean scrub. On the summit there is red lavender and Kermes oak. These take over from the communities of holm oak which dominate the more protected areas with deeper soil. On the cliffs of the Cap de Sant Antoni, the vegetation is characterised by plants adapted to growing in the fissures, cracks and sherves of the cliff, and able to withstand contact with salt water. In the areas closest to the sea, Marine Fennel and the everlasting flower, Helichrysum decumbens, can be found. As one moves away from the sea and the salinity decreases the valencian rock violet appears as well as cave scabius on the steeper slopes. On more level ground, diannic endemic plants can be found (the town of Denia takes its name from the cult to the Roman goddess Diana) such as the valencian rock violet and also diannic pitiusic vegetation (in reference to the nearby archipelago Pitiusas) such as rock thistle and valerian can be found. On the plain, as on the hillside, lavender and Kermes oak grow mingled with repopulated aleppo or carrasco pine and vegetation typical of unirrigated land. Shady cliffs, with their increased humidity level, isolation and inaccessibility encourage the growth of endemic plants such as valencian rock violet, Cave Scabius, Sanguisorba ancistroides, and Sarcocapnos saetabensis. On wider shelves, a community of Black Sabina and Chamaerops humilis has developed. In areas exposed to the sun, various communities of species adapted to high temperatures and scarce humidity levels are located, such as Chaenorrhinum crassifolium and Teucrium hifacense. ===Fauna=== The marine bird life comprises the yellow-footed gull (Larus cachinnans), Sandwich tern (Sterna sandvicensis) and Audouin's gull (Larus audouinii), amongst other species. The peregrine falcon and the Eurasian eagle owl live on the Montg√≥ as well as eagles, ravens, seagulls and an abundance of other migratory birds. In the higher areas the patiamarilla gull nests and Audouin's gull winters along with Bonelli's eagle. In total there are eight species of birds of prey in the Montg√≥ Natural Park which have been documented to be breeding. Four of these species are nocturnal (Eurasian eagle owl, Eurasian scops owl, tawny owl and the little owl) and the other four diurnal (goshawk, peregrine falcon, common kestrel and Eurasian sparrowhawk). They feed on the many European rabbits, red foxes, toads, snakes, dormice, brown rats, European badgers, common genets, weasels and bats which share their mountain home. Although there is no concrete evidence as yet, it is probable that common buzzards, short-toed eagles and the Eleanora's falcon also reproduce in the Montg√≥ park. Due to shortages of places to collect water, amphibians are rare, although the common toad and the natterjack toad are still found. Reptiles are more frequent, such as the viviparous lizard, the ocellated lizard, the horseshoe whip snake, and, most exotically, Bedriaga's skink. As regards invertebrate species, there are a great number of gastropods and insects.http://www.xabia.org/apartado.php?sapa_id=21 == Human inhabitants == The first evidence of human presence on Montg√≥ dates to the Paleolithic period some 30,000 years ago. During this period, small nomadic groups occupied the caves and hills that faced the sea in the Cap de San antoni. The communities lived a hunter-gatherer way of life, and were able to survive thanks to rich fishing grounds, plentiful supply of animals and mild temperatures. Evidence of human presence in past millennia can be seen in the famous paintings in Migdia cave. Elsewhere on the mountain Stone-Age hand-axes and flints have been found along with Roman pottery and Muslim ceramics. At the beginning of the 10th century the moorish Caliph, Abd ur Rahman the Third, made a special trip from Cordoba to collect over a hundred medicinal herbs from the slopes of Montg√≥. At the end of the 19th century, a high demand for raisins led to the cultivation of the Moscatel grape on its slopes. Today, these areas have been largely abandoned due to difficulty in accessibility and non-profitability. Yet some vines, which produce the sweet grape variety, mostly the Mistela of the Marina Alta, as well as some citrus products, are still grown. == Climatic conditions == Clouds are often seen forming around the peak of Montg√≥ even when the sky is clear elsewhere. This is caused by Orographic lift. Humid air from the Mediterranean is forced up towards the summit of the Montg√≥, then condenses and falls as rain. Despite its dry and austere appearance, rain is common on the mountain, with peak precipitation occurring between September and November. However, during the summer there is often a long period of drought. == Climbing the Montg√≥ == It is possible to climb to the top of Montg√≥ from all sides. The excursion leads through numerous eco-systems: stony terrain, croplands, pine forests and scrub land.http://www.comunitatvalenciana.com/natura/natura3.htm?idnat=33&idioma;_sess=3 The ascent takes about four hours. At the summit of Montg√≥ one will find the remains of the Casa de Biot, an Iberian settlement of the eighth century B.C. From the summit there are magnificent views of the coast and the sea and on a clear day, Ibiza can be seen. == Legislation protecting the Montg√≥ == Decree 25/87 issued on March 16, 1987 by the Consell of the Generalitat Valenciana declared the Montg√≥ a Natural Park. This decree has since been modified by Ordinance 110/92. Law 5/88 issued on June 24, 1988 by the Generalitat Valenciana protects the nature reserves of the Province of Valencia.http://www.xabia.org/rutas.php?rut_id=9 ==See also== *Mountains of the Valencian Community == References  *Park Website Category:Baetic System Category:Natural parks of Spain Category:Natural parks of the Valencian Community Category:Protected areas established in 1987 Category:Mountains of the Valencian Community Category:Protected areas of the Valencian Community ","title":"Montg√≥ Massif"},{"id":"2221642","text":"Assay sensitivity is a property of a clinical trial defined as the ability of a trial to distinguish an effective treatment from a less effective or ineffective intervention. Without assay sensitivity, a trial is not internally valid and is not capable of comparing the efficacy of two interventions. == Importance == Lack of assay sensitivity has different implications for trials intended to show a difference greater than zero between interventions (superiority trials) and trials intended to show non-inferiority. Non- inferiority trials attempt to rule out some margin of inferiority between a test and control intervention i.e. rule out that the test intervention is no worse than the control intervention by a chosen amount. If a trial intended to demonstrate efficacy by showing superiority of a test intervention to control lacks assay sensitivity, it will fail to show that the test intervention is superior and will fail to lead to a conclusion of efficacy. In contrast, if a trial intended to demonstrate efficacy by showing a test intervention is non- inferior to an active control lacks assay sensitivity, the trial may find an ineffective intervention to be non-inferior and could lead to an erroneous conclusion of efficacy. When two interventions within a trial are shown to have different efficacy (i.e., when one intervention is superior), that finding itself directly demonstrates that the trial had assay sensitivity (assuming the finding is not related to random or systematic error). In contrast, a trial that demonstrates non-inferiority between two interventions, or an unsuccessful superiority trial, generally does not contain such direct evidence of assay sensitivity. == Differences in sensitivity == Assay sensitivity for a non-inferiority trial may depend upon the chosen margin of inferiority ruled out by the trial, and the design of the planned non- inferiority trial. The chosen margin of inferiority in a non-inferiority trial cannot be larger than the largest effect size which the control intervention reliably and reproducibly demonstrates compared to placebo or no treatment in past superiority trials. For instance, if there is reliable and reproducible evidence from previous superiority trials of an effect size of 10% for a control intervention compared to placebo, an appropriately designed non- inferiority trial designed to rule out that the test intervention may be as much as 5% less effective than the control would have assay sensitivity. On the other hand, with this same data, a noninferiority trial designed to rule out that the test intervention may be as much as 15% less effective than the control may not have assay sensitivity, since this trial would not ensure that the test intervention is any more effective than a placebo given that the effect ruled out is larger than the effect of the control compared to placebo. The choice of the margin is sometimes problematic in non-inferiority trials. Given investigators desire to choose larger margins to decrease the sample size needed to perform a trial, the chosen margin is sometimes larger than the effect size of the control compared to placebo. In addition, a valid noninferiority trial is not possible in situations in which there is a lack of data demonstrating a reliable and reproducible effect of the control compared to placebo. In addition to choosing a margin based upon credible past evidence, to have assay sensitivity, the planned non-inferiority trial must be designed in a way similar to the past trials which demonstrated the effectiveness of the control compared to placebo, the so-called \\"constancy assumption\\". In this way, non-inferiority trials have a feature in common with external (historically) controlled trials. This also means that non- inferiority trials are subject to some of the same biases as historically controlled trials; that is, the effect of a drug in a past trial may not be the same in a current trial given changes in medical practice, differences in disease definitions or changes in the natural history of a disease, differences in outcome timing and definitions, usage of concomitant medications, etc. The finding of \\"difference\\" or \\"no difference\\" between two interventions is not a direct demonstration of the internal validity of the trial unless another internal control confirms that the study methods have the ability to show a difference, if one exists, over the range of interest (i.e. the trial contains a third group receiving placebo). Since most clinical trials do not contain an internal \\"negative\\" control (i.e. a placebo group) to internally validate the trial, the data to evaluate the validity of the trial comes from past trials external to the current trial. == See also == *Sensitivity (tests) *Specificity (tests) == References  External links == *ClinicalTrials.gov from US National Library of Medicine *FDA Website Category:Clinical research Category:Pharmaceutical industry Category:Clinical trials ","title":"Assay sensitivity"},{"id":"2221650","text":"Henri Mouhot (May 15, 1826 -- November 10, 1861) was a French naturalist and explorer of the mid-19th century. He was born in Montb√©liard, Doubs, France, near the Swiss border, but spent his childhood in Russia and, possibly, parts of Asia. He died near Naphan, Laos. He is remembered mostly in connection to Angkor. Mouhot's tomb is located just outside of Ban Phanom, to the east of Luang Prabang. ==Early life== He traveled throughout Europe with his brother Charles, studying photographic techniques developed by Louis Daguerre. In 1856, he began devoting himself to the study of Natural Science. Upon reading \\"The Kingdom and People of Siam\\" by Sir John Bowring in 1857, Mouhot decided to travel to Indochina to conduct a series of botanical expeditions for the collection of new zoological specimens. His initial requests for grants and passage were rejected by French companies and the government of Napoleon III. The Royal Geographical Society and the Zoological Society of London lent him their support, and he set sail for Bangkok, via Singapore. ==Expeditions== 250px From his base in Bangkok in 1858, Mouhot made four journeys into the interior of Siam, Cambodia and Laos. Over a period of three years before he died, he endured extreme hardships and fended off wild animals, to explore some previously uncharted jungle territory. On his first expedition, he visited Ayutthaya, the former capital of Siam (already charted territory), and gathered an extensive collection of insects, as well as terrestrial and river shells, and sent them on to England. In January 1860, at the end of his second and longest journey, he reached Angkor (already charted territory) -- an area spread over more than 400 km¬≤., consisting of many sites of ancient terraces, pools, moated cities, palaces and temples, the most famous of which is Angkor Wat. He recorded this visit in his travel journals, which included three weeks of detailed observations. These journals and illustrations were later incorporated into Voyage dans les royaumes de Siam, de Cambodge, de Laos which were published posthumously. ===Angkor=== Facade of Angkor Wat, by Henri Mouhot Henri Mouhot drawing: Angkor Wat Pavilion of Angkor Wat, by Henri Mouhot Mouhot is often mistakenly credited with \\"discovering\\" Angkor, although Angkor was never lost ‚Äî the location and existence of the entire series of Angkor sites was always known to the Khmers and had been visited by several westerners since the 16th century. Mouhot mentions in his journals that his contemporary Father Charles Emile Bouillevaux, a French missionary based in Battambang, had reported that he and other Western explorers and missionaries had visited Angkor Wat and the other Khmer temples at least five years before Mouhot. Father Bouillevaux published his accounts in 1857: \\"Travel in Indochina 1848‚Äì1846, The Annam and Cambodia\\". Previously, a Portuguese trader Diogo do Couto visited Angkor and wrote his accounts about it in 1550, and the Portuguese monk Antonio da Magdalena had also written about his visit to Angkor Wat in 1586. Mouhot did, however, popularise Angkor in the West. Perhaps none of the previous European visitors wrote as evocatively as Mouhot, who included interesting and detailed sketches. In his posthumously published \\"Travels in Siam, Cambodia and Laos,\\" Mouhot compared Angkor to the pyramids, for it was popular in the West at that time to ascribe the origin of all civilization to the Middle East. For example, he described the Buddha heads at the gateways to Angkor Thom as \\"four immense heads in the Egyptian style\\" and wrote of Angkor: > \\"One of these temples--a rival to that of Solomon, and erected by some > ancient Michael Angelo--might take an honourable place beside our most > beautiful buildings. It is grander than anything left to us by Greece or > Rome, and presents a sad contrast to the state of barbarism in which the > nation is now plunged.\\" Mouhot also wrote that: > \\"At Ongcor, there are ...ruins of such grandeur... that, at the first view, > one is filled with profound admiration, and cannot but ask what has become > of this powerful race, so civilized, so enlightened, the authors of these > gigantic works?\\" Such quotations may have given rise to the popular misconception that Mouhot had found the abandoned ruins of a lost civilisation. The Royal Geographical Society and The Zoological Society, both interested in announcing new finds, seemed to have encouraged the rumor that Mouhot ‚Äî whom they had sponsored to chart mountains and rivers and catalog new species ‚Äî had discovered Angkor. Mouhot himself erroneously asserted that Angkor was the work of an earlier civilization than the Khmer. For although the very same civilization which built Angkor was alive and right before his eyes, he considered them in a \\"state of barbarism\\" and could not believe they were civilized or enlightened enough to have built it. He assumed that the authors of such grandeur were a disappeared race and mistakenly dated Angkor back over two millennia, to around the same era as Rome. The true history of Angkor Wat was later pieced together from the book The Customs of Cambodia written by Tem√ºr Khan's envoy Zhou Daguan to Cambodia in 1295-1296Translated into French as early as 1819, perhaps Mouhot knew of it and from stylistic and epigraphic evidence accumulated during the subsequent clearing and restoration work carried out across the whole Angkor site. It is now known that the dates of Angkor's habitation were from the early 9th to the early 15th centuries. ==Colonialism== Some have argued that Mouhot may have been a tool for French expansionism and the annexation of territories which followed shortly after his death. Mouhot himself, however, did not seem to be a hardcore colonialist, for he occasionally doubted the beneficial effects of European colonisation: > \\"Will the present movement of the nations of Europe towards the East result > in good by introducing into these lands the blessings of our civilization? > Or shall we, as blind instruments of boundless ambition, come hither as a > scourge, to add to their present miseries?\\" ==Death and legacy== Henri Mouhot's grave in 1867; from Francis Garnier's book of the Mekong Expedition of 1866‚Äì68 Henri Mouhot's grave in 2007 Mouhot died of a malarial fever on his 4th expedition, in the jungles of Laos. He had been visiting Luang Prabang, capital of the Lan Xang kingdom, one of 3 kingdoms which eventually merged into what can be known as modern day Laos, and was under the patronage of the king. Two of his servants buried him near a French mission in Naphan, by the banks of the Nam Khan river. Mouhot's favourite servant, Phrai, transported all of Mouhot's journals and specimens back to Bangkok, from where they were shipped to Europe. A modest monument was erected over his grave in 1867 under the orders of French commander Ernest Doudart de Lagr√©e, who gave him this eulogy: > \\"We found everywhere the memory of our compatriot who, by the uprightness of > his character and his natural benevolence, had acquired the regard and the > affection of the natives.\\" The monument was destroyed by the overflow of the river Nam Khan. It was replaced in 1887 by a more durable crypt monument, and a maisonnette was built nearby to house and feed visitors to the white shrine. Some restoration work was done on the tomb in 1951 by the EFEO (Ecole Fran√ßaise d'Extr√®me Orient‚ÄîThe French School of the Far East). Mouhot's tomb was consumed by the jungle and lost until it was accidentally rediscovered in 1989 by a French Laos scholar, Jean-Michel Strobino, who played a part in rehabilitating it with the support of the French embassy and the Municipality of Montbeliard, Mouhot's birth town. A new plaque was fixed to one end of the crypt in 1990 to commemorate this rediscovery. The location is now known to hotels and tourist operators in Luang Prabang, and a minivan or \\"tuk tuk\\" may be hired to take one the 10 km from town to visit it. This entails a walk down a steep track on the southern bank of river Nam Khan, over a small wooden bridge, and then up to a well- cleared track to the tomb, altogether about 150 meters. A new road being constructed nearby (June 2013) will make access easier. The tomb is still quite near the river (only about 20m), and access by boat from town should be possible. As more people visit the tomb, the pathway hopefully will be improved, as it is quite slippery after rain; sensible shoes are a must. The popularity of Angkor generated by Mouhot's writings led to the popular support for a major French role in its study and preservation. The French carried out the majority of research work on Angkor until recently. Two species of Asian reptiles are named in his honor: Cuora mouhotii, a turtle; and Oligodon mouhoti, a snake.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Routine work proved distasteful to him, and he read with avidity the works of Jean Charles, Chevalier Folard and other theoretical writers on war, and of Rousseau. After sixteen years service he left Prussia, and endeavoured without success to obtain a commission in the Austrian army. He then returned to Prussia, and for some time managed a theatrical company. The failure of this undertaking involved B√ºlow in heavy losses, and soon afterwards he went to America, where he seems to have been converted to, and to have preached, Swedenborgianism. On his return to Europe he persuaded his brother to engage in a speculation for exporting glass to the United States, which proved a complete failure. After this for some years he made a precarious living in Berlin by literary work, but his debts accumulated, and it was under great disadvantages that he produced his Geist des Neueren Kriegssystems (Hamburg, 1799) and Der Feldzug 1801 (Berlin, 1801). His hopes of military employment were again disappointed, and his brother, the future field marshal, who had stood by him in all his troubles, finally left him. ==Writing career== In 1797, B√ºlow published his two-volume Der Freistaat von Nordamerika in seinem neuesten Zustand. It offered an decidedly negative account of the United States. John Quincy Adams, then U.S. minister at Berlin, translated the work, describing it as a \\"libel upon America.\\" Adams' transcription was subsequently published in Joseph Dennie's Philadelphia-based Port Folio in the early 1800s.Kirsten Belgum, ‚ÄúAccidental Encounter: Why John Quincy Adams Translated German Culture for Americans,‚Äù Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal 13, no. 1 (Winter 2015):209‚Äì36; John Quincy Adams' Diary, May 3, 1799, in Adams Family Papers, Massachusetts Historical Society, Boston, Mass., available at http://www.masshist.org/jqadiaries/php/popup?id=jqad24_256 After wandering in France and the smaller German states, Bulow reappeared at Berlin in 1804, where he wrote a revised edition of his Geist des Neueren Kriegssystems (Hamburg, 1805), Lehrstze des Neueren Kriegs (Berlin, 1805), Geschichte des Prinzen Heinrich von Preussen (Berlin, 1805), Neue Taktik der Neuern wie sie sein sollte (Leipzig, 1805), and Der Feldzug 1805 (Leipzig, 1806). He also edited, with G. H. von Behrenhorst (1733‚Äì1814) and others, Annalen des Krieges (Berlin, 1806). These brilliant but unorthodox works, distinguished by an open contempt of the Prussian system, cosmopolitanism hardly to be distinguished from high treason, and the mordant sarcasm of a disappointed man, brought upon B√ºlow the enmity of the official classes and of the government. He was arrested as insane, but medical examination proved him sane and he was then lodged as a prisoner in Kolberg, where he was harshly treated, though August von Gneisenau obtained some mitigation of his condition. Thence he passed into Russian hands and died in prison at Riga in 1807, probably as a result of ill- treatment. ==Assessment== According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition: His early training had shown him merely the pedantic minutiae of Frederick's methods, and, in the absence of any troops capable of illustrating the real linear tactics, he became an enthusiastic supporter of the methods, which (more of necessity than from judgment) the French revolutionary generals had adopted, of fighting in small columns covered by skirmishers. Battles, he maintained, were won by skirmishers. We must organize disorder, he said; indeed, every argument of writers of the modern extended order school is to be found mutatis mutandis in B√ºlow, whose system acquired great prominence in view of the mechanical improvements in armament. But his tactics, like his strategy, were vitiated by the absence of friction, and their dependence on the realization of an unattainable standard of bravery. ==NotesNotesReferences== * Endnotes: **von Voss, H. von B√ºlow (K√∂ln, 1806) **P. von B√ºlow, Familienbuch der v.

Although found all over Europe, the grayling mostly inhabits coastal areas, with inland populations declining significantly in recent years. The grayling lives in dry and warm habitats with easy access to the sun, which helps them with body temperature regulation. A grayling goes through four stages in its life cycle. The eggs hatch around August, and larvae grow in four instars from August to the following June. By June, the larvae begin to pupate by spinning a silk cocoon below the surface of the ground. The adult grayling emerges around August. The grayling migrates in small groups of two or three butterflies throughout most of August, typically moving southeast. H. semele engages in cryptic coloring, with their tan and brown colored wings helping them camouflage into their surroundings. The grayling exposes the eyespots on its wings when it believes to have been detected by a predator, but generally keeps them hidden to avoid being seen. Male butterflies are territorial, and engage in flight performances to determine who settles in the best oviposition site. Additionally, the grayling regulates its body temperature by orienting its body and posture to adjust to the heat from the sun. Grayling populations have recently begun to decline, and while it is not globally endangered, the species is now considered a priority for conservation efforts in the United Kingdom. == Geographic range == Hipparchia semele lives at elevations between sea level and about . The grayling is a species endemic to Europe, and is found almost all over Europe and parts of western Russia. In parts of northern and western Europe, including Scandinavia, Britain, Ireland, and the Baltic states, it can be seen mostly in the coastal areas. The butterfly population is declining in many areas, especially inland. The grayling is not found in west France, large parts of Greece, Albania, North Macedonia, and south of Bulgaria and the Mediterranean islands. ==Description in Seitz== S. semele L. (42 f). The female above similar to the preceding [ anthe ie. dark brown with a yellow-orange submarginal band marked in the female, more discreet in the male, with an interrupted fringe and two black blind or very discreetly pupiled ocelli on the forewing and a very small ocellus on the hindwing. The verso of the forewing is yellow-orange surrounded by a marbled band of brown and white with the two black ocelli while the hindwing verso is marbled with brown and white.], but the bands above ivory-yellow, often obscured, especially on the hindwing. The male above almost entirely dark, the band being only perceptible on the hindwing in the form of a row of obsolete ochre- yellow spots. Both sexes show, on a pale ochre ground, before the anal angle a dark ocellus which occasionally is pupilled with white. The underside of the hindwing is marbled with dark, a pale powdering in the form of a band terminating the basal portion distally. this band protruding in a strong tooth below the cell towards the margin.

Band 1: Abt. 1, Die Gro√üschmetterlinge des palaearktischen Faunengebietes, Die palaearktischen Tagfalter, 1909, 379 Seiten, mit 89 kolorierten Tafeln (3470 Figuren) == Habitat == Grayling populations are typically found in dry habitats with warm climates to aid in their thermoregulatory behavior. Often found in sand dunes, salt marshes, undercliffs, and clifftops in coastal regions, and heathlands, limestone pavements, scree and brownfield land in inland regions, but graylings are also known to inhabit old quarries, railway lines, and industrial areas. Colonies typically develop around areas with little vegetation and bare, open ground, with spots of shelter and sun to help them regulate their body temperature. == Food resources  Adult diet === Hipparchia semele can be considered a specialist feeding species. They tend to feed on the following plants: * Bird's-foot Trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) * Bramble (Rubus fruticosus) * Carline thistle (Carlina vulgaris) * Heather (Calluna vulgaris) * Marjoram (Origanum vulgare) * Red Clover (Trifolium pretense) * Teasel (Dipsacus fullonum) * Thistles (Cirsium spp. and Carduus spp.) == Parental care  Oviposition === Hipparchia semele sometimes lay their eggs on the green leaves that the larvae later feed on. Because the adult butterflies lay their eggs on the ground, the larvae can easily find the host plants to feed on. Therefore, laying eggs directly on host plants does not seem to be crucial for survival to adulthood. == Life history  Life cycle === Note that information on this species applies to Great Britain and some details may not be consistent with the species in other parts of its range. There is one generation per year. The eggs are laid from July to September singly, often on the food plant. H. semele eggs are white at first, but turn pale yellow as they develop. The egg stage generally lasts between two and three weeks. When the eggs hatch, the caterpillar grows slowly, feeding at night and typically hibernating during cold temperatures in a deep patch of grass. The larvae are small and cream colored, and there are four moults. The first-instar and second-instar larvae feed in mid-to-late summer and then hibernate, while still small, in the third instar, at the base of a tussock. Feeding then resumes in the spring and the last instar larvae are nocturnal, hiding in the base of grass tussocks during the day. These larval instars take place from August to June. By June, the larvae should be fully grown, and at this point the caterpillar spends most of its time basking in the sun on the bare ground or rocks. The larvae are attracted to muddy puddles and sap from tree trunks. When the time comes to pupate, the caterpillar spins a cocoon in the ground. Pupation happens in a cavity lined with silk below the surface of the ground. The pupa is unattached in an earth cell. The pupal stage lasts around four weeks. The pupa is formed from June to August and the adult butterflies emerge in August.

The flight direction of these migrating grayling is direct and constant, notably because they do not pause or dart off into short flights. The grayling generally migrates in the southeast direction through most of August. == Protective coloration and behavior  Cryptic and mimicking color and behavior === Grayling butterfly engages in cryptic coloring behavior to camouflage into environment. Hipparchia semele engages in cryptic coloring, or camouflage that makes it difficult to see them when they are resting on the bare ground, tree trunks, rocks, etc. Their tan and brown colored wings help them conceal themselves. Usually at rest and when not in flight, the butterflies keep their wings closed, with their forewings tucked behind their hindwings. This helps them conceal their eyespots and makes them appear smaller, further helping them camouflage to their environment. Additionally, the forewing of a Hipparchia semele has one large and one small eyespot. When the grayling butterfly believes it may have been detected by a predator, it exposes these spots. However, there may be a balance between their cryptic coloring behavior and the exposure of their conspicuous eye spots. Exposing their spots may increase detectability by their predators. Therefore, at rest, the grayling adopts its cryptic coloring position, pulling its forewings down behind its hindwings in order to conceal the eyespots. == Mating  Mate searching behavior === When it comes time to mate, male and female H. semele meet above a solitary tree in a wide and open area. This takes on many forms, from a tall tree in a heathland to bare patches of ground in sand dunes. The female lays her eggs on various fine-leaved grasses, including fescues, bents, and bromes, a few centimeters above the ground. === Male-male behaviors ===  Lekking  Male butterflies exhibit behaviors for defending territories. Females choose males based on the best territory for them to lay their eggs in. These territorial males engage in competitions of flight performances where the winning male settles in the territory. Thermoregulation helps these butterflies prepare for maximum flight efficiency in order to gain ownership of the most optimal territory.  Displaying  Male graylings make short and frequent flights, both spontaneous and non- spontaneous. These may function as a signal of display for females. === Female-male interactions ===  Pheromones  The male graylings‚Äô courtship procedure for copulation may also serve to indicate to the female the amount and the nature of the males‚Äô sex pheromones. Further research must be conducted to determine this for certain, but the courtship procedure likely plays a role in pheromone production. Hipparchia semele only copulate once, so determining the best possible male, based on the pheromones and courting procedure, is very important for reproductive success. Pheromone releasers are located all over the wings of the males.  Mate choice  Grayling females partake in resource defense polygyny. Females choose a territorial male in order to gain the best oviposition site. This allows for a higher survival rate of the eggs, as well as the inheritance of the ability to defend the best territories which are attractive to females, leading to a higher reproductive rate of the offspring, thus allowing the female grayling a higher opportunity to propagate her genes. Grayling male (right) courting female (left)  Courting  A complex courtship procedure is performed by grayling males for copulation. The male moves behind the female, and engages in short movements around her until they are facing each other. Then, the male raises his forewings slowly, and quickly lowers and closes them, continuing this rhythmically. He then spreads his antennae to create a circular shape, and spreads his wings so the forewings are separated from the hindwings. After closing the wings again slowly, the male moves around the female again, and attempts copulation. == Physiology  Flight === The grayling is a large and distinctive butterfly when in flight. The flight of a grayling is characterized by strong loops. The flying patterns of a grayling are also important in male-male interactions of territoriality. Initially, when defending a territory, each male grayling flies in a spiral motion, trying to be higher than and behind the other male. When this formation is stabilized, the two male graylings go into an alternating sequence of dives and climbs. At the end, the male that is able to achieve the highest position settles in the territory. === Thermoregulation === The graylings prefer to live in open habitats, with easy access to the sun. This may be due to their ability to regulate their body temperature using the sun. When the temperature gets too cold, the grayling leans to expose its side towards the sunlight, therefore allowing its wings to gain heat from the sun. When the temperature gets too warm, the grayling stands straight, on its tiptoes, exposing its head towards the sun and keeping the majority of its body away. The male tends to orient its body and wings to control which parts of the body are exposed to the sun. This allows the grayling to keep its body temperature as close to the preferred level as possible. Therefore, at lower temperatures, the male grayling exposes as much of its body area as it can to increase the surface area facing the sun. This process is sometimes called sun-basking. This can raise body temperatures by up to 3 degrees Celsius. Contrarily, at high temperatures, the male grayling exposes as little of its body area as possible to the sun. This process can lower body temperatures by up to 2.5 degrees Celsius. At intermediate temperatures, the male grayling is often observed gradually changing his body orientation and posture in order to evenly spread the heat all over his body. This behavior can often be observed by male butterflies defending their territories. Many times, the territories that male graylings defend are specific mating sites. Thermoregulation allows the male butterflies to maximize their efficiency, in order to prepare for optimal flight performance if another male enters the territory. == Conservation (Great Britain) == The grayling has been decreasing in numbers significantly in recent years. While it was not considered of importance before, Hipparchia semele is now considered a priority species for conservation efforts in the United Kingdom. It is now a UK Biodiversity Action Plan species (Butterfly Conservation, 2007). === Habitat loss === Much of the Hipparchia semele‚Äôs common habitats, such as heathlands, have started to become transformed into agricultural land. The dry habitats are occupied by trees and other greenery, reducing the optimal available habitats for the graylings. == References  External links == * Butterfly Conservation website * UK Butterflies website - includes a list of sites around the UK where this species can be found * * Category:Hipparchia (butterfly) Category:Butterflies described in 1758 Category:Butterflies of Europe Category:Endangered species of the British Isles Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Grayling (butterfly)"},{"id":"2221668","text":"KXAN-TV, virtual channel 36 (UHF digital channel 21), is an NBC-affiliated television station licensed to Austin, Texas, United States. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group, as part of a duopoly with Llano-licensed MyNetworkTV affiliate KBVO (channel 14); Nexstar also operates CW affiliate KNVA (channel 54) under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with owner Vaughan Media. The three stations share studios on West Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard between the Old West Austin section of Austin and the University of Texas at Austin campus (a setup which consists of the main studio and newsroom, and an unconnected auxiliary office building across the street); KXAN-TV's transmitter is located at the West Austin Antenna Farm north of West Lake Hills. On cable, the station is available on Charter Spectrum, Suddenlink and Grande Communications channel 4. ==History== The station first signed on the air on February 12, 1965, as KHFI-TV, broadcasting on UHF channel 42. It was owned by the Kingsbury family, along with KHFI radio (970 AM, now KTSN at 1490; and 98.3 FM, now KVET-FM at 98.1). KHFI was the second television station in Austin, signing on a little more than twelve years after KTBC-TV (channel 7). Although Austin was big enough to support three television stations as early as the 1950s, KTBC was the only VHF license in the area. Until 1964, UHF stations could only be seen with an expensive converter, and even then picture quality left much to be desired. Additionally, UHF signals usually do not travel very far over long distances or over rugged terrain. This made several potential owners skittish about the prospects for UHF in a market that stretched from Mason in the west to La Grange in the east, and also included much of the Hill Country. KHFI-TV logically should have signed on as Austin's NBC station, since up to that time all three networks had been shoehorned on KTBC, then a primary CBS affiliate. However, due to contractual obligations, it spent more than a year-and-a-half as an independent before joining NBC in 1966. Unlike most affiliates with the network in then two- station markets, KHFI did not take on a secondary ABC affiliation (KTBC instead took on the secondary ABC affiliation, until a third station, KVUE signed on in 1971, taking on the ABC affiliation). The Kingsburys would later bring in Henry Tippie as a partner and on January 15, 1973 were granted permission from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to move KHFI-TV to channel 36. KTVV's logo in June 1974. With the channel change came a new set of call letters, KTVV. The station also boosted its transmitter power to five million watts, which more than doubled its coverage area, and for a time billed itself as the most powerful TV station in the Southwest with these changes. What was then known as LIN Broadcasting purchased the station in 1979. The call letters were changed to the current KXAN-TV on October 15, 1987, in reference to then-sister station and fellow NBC affiliate (now owned- and-operated station) KXAS-TV in Fort Worth. Even with the increased power, channel 36's signal was marginal in some parts of the Hill Country such as Fredericksburg. On September 6, 1991, LIN signed on KLNO in Llano to improve KXAN's reach in the Hill Country. It changed that station's call letters to KXAM-TV after about a month on the air and later to the current KBVO on August 3, 2009. This call sign, named after the University of Texas' mascot \\"Bevo\\", was formerly used on the current channel 42‚Äîwhich is now CBS affiliate KEYE- TV‚Äîfrom December 1983 to July 1995, and is shared with channel 14's repeater KBVO-CD.

KXAN is one of two stations in Austin (the other being KVUE, channel 24) to retain its original network affiliation in the wake of a network swap between KTBC and Fox station KBVO (now KEYE-TV, channel 42) in 1995, the result of Fox's affiliation deal with New World Communications due to that network acquiring rights to NFL games.Fox Network Takes 12 Stations from Big Three, The Buffalo News (via HighBeam Research), May 24, 1994. On October 21, 2009, KBVO became a separate station after picking up the MyNetworkTV affiliation from KNVA. That station carried the network as a secondary affiliation (airing on KNVA on Monday through Saturday nights from 9 to 11 p.m.), known on-air as \\"MyNetworkTV on The CW Austin\\", from its launch on September 5, 2006. In mid-September 2009, that station moved MyNetworkTV programs an hour later from 10 p.m. to midnight to make room for a nightly 9 p.m. newscast to compete with KTBC's established prime time newscast.My LIN TV: 4 More For New Fox Net, Broadcasting & Cable, April 26, 2006.

KXAN's current tower was activated in 1996, replacing an older structure that had been built in 1964. Of the fifteen towers on the hill, the channel 36 tower is the tallest and the highest structure in Austin. In addition to its transmission antenna, the mast also incorporates a camera with views of downtown to the east and the hills to the west. On March 21, 2014, it was announced that Media General would acquire LIN. The merger was completed on December 19, 2014,http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/81736/media-generallin-media-merger- closes and KXAN joined the Media General station portfolio. Just over a year after that deal was completed, on January 27, 2016, Media General announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Nexstar Broadcasting Group (who is based in Irving and already owns many other stations in Texas), in a deal valued at $17.14 per-share, valuing the company at $4.6 billion plus the assumption of $2.3 billion debt. The combined company would be known as Nexstar Media Group, and own 171 stations (including KXAN- TV), serving an estimated 39% of households. The merger also marked a re-entry into Austin for Nexstar, which had managed CBS affiliate KEYE-TV under a groupwide agreement with the Four Points Media Group before that company's stations were sold to Sinclair at the beginning of 2012.

The dispute centered around KXAN's failure to grant retransmission consent to Suddenlink. The station was removed from Suddenlink after the previous contract expired on December 31, 2007. KXAN claimed that it was seeking \\"fair value\\" for its programming. However, a press release from Suddenlink management indicated that the dispute included consideration for other stations owned by LIN TV outside of Texas. On January 3, 2008, Suddenlink began transmitting the signal of Temple-based NBC affiliate KCEN-TV to restore the network's programming to the affected areas. This is allowed under FCC rules because KCEN is a \\"significantly viewed\\" station in Williamson County even though that county is located in the Austin market. On March 24, Suddenlink and KXAN's dispute was settled and the station's programming was restored to Suddenlink's systems the following day. The terms of the settlement were not announced though it is widely believed that KXAN had lost thousands of viewers. Despite its cable carriage problems, the station surprised many observers by placing first in the 5‚Äì7 a.m. weekday time slot during the May 2008 sweeps period. ===Time Warner Cable=== KXAN and LIN TV were locked in another contract dispute with Time Warner Cable, which serves a very large majority of the Austin metropolitan area. LIN dropped its stations from Time Warner Cable systems nationwide at Midnight CDT on October 3, 2008. Over-the-air stations such as KXAN have long allowed cable companies to carry their signals for free. Cable networks are paid as much as ten cents per day per subscriber for their content and LIN TV wanted Time Warner to pay them less than one cent per subscriber per day. KXAN general manager Eric Lassberg stated that the cable company \\"does not have to pass that cost along to the viewers unless they want to\\". On October 3, Time Warner replaced KXAN with a continuous loop of instructions on how to hook up a television to a computer on Time Warner Cable.KXAN goes dark for Time Warner customers, Austin American-Statesman, October 3, 2008. Some days later this was replaced by the premium channel Starz Kids and Family. KXAN returned to the Time Warner lineup during the early morning hours of October 29, 2008. No details were released on the deal though some have speculated that KXAN could not afford to be without over 67% of their previous viewers during the critical November ratings period.KXAN returns to Time Warner Cable, Austin American-Statesman, October 29, 2008. ==Programming== Syndicated programming on KXAN includes Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy!, Dr. Phil and Rachael Ray. KXAN is the Austin broadcast television home of the San Antonio Spurs, sharing coverage with sister station KBVO. ==News operation== Offices near the University of Texas campus KXAN-TV presently broadcasts 31 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with five hours each weekday and three hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). For most of its first 30 years on the air, KHFI/KTVV/KXAN was a distant runner-up to KTBC. Despite efforts to produce a newscast of major market quality (early newscasts deliberately copied the look of NBC owned-and- operated station WNBC in New York City), it was usually unable to make a dent in KTBC's ratings dominance. Another setback was as a UHF station, KTVV/KXAN had a hard time maintaining a local share as an NBC affiliate due to the presence of nearby NBC stations in the San Antonio and Temple/Waco markets. KXAN's first number one rated newscast was also Austin's first hour-long morning newscast, News 36 Firstcast, which went on the air in November 1990. All other local stations soon followed suit, but Firstcast built an audience that delivered KXAN the station's first sweeps victory in February 1993. After KTBC switched to its current Fox affiliation in 1995, KXAN's ratings slowly increased in other time periods. By the latter part of the 1990s, channel 36 had overtaken channel 7 for the lead. Since then, it has waged a spirited battle for first place in the market with KVUE. On December 23, 2008, starting with the weekday noon newscast, KXAN became the third television station in the Austin market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. On September 28, 2009, the station began producing a nightly 9 p.m. newscast on KNVA (currently titled KXAN News at 9) to compete with KTBC's longer-established and hour-long prime time newscast.KXAN launches 9pm newscast on The CW, Austin American-Statesman, August 27, 2009.

Tim Treadwell's life, work, and death were the subject of Werner Herzog's critically acclaimed documentary film Grizzly Man (2005).Grizzly Man (DVD). Directed by Werner Herzog. Lions Gate, 2005. == Early life == Treadwell was born on Long Island, New York, one of five children of Val and Carol Dexter. He attended Connetquot High School, where he was the swimming team's star diver. He was very fond of animals and kept a squirrel named Willie as a pet. In an interview in the film Grizzly Man (2005), his parents say he was an ordinary young man until he went away to college. There, he claimed that he was a British orphan who was born in Australia. According to this account, his father said Timothy \\"spiraled down\\" and became an alcoholic after he lost the role of Woody Boyd to Woody Harrelson in the sitcom Cheers. Treadwell studied grizzly bears during summer seasons for 13 years, before being killed by one of them. According to his book, Among Grizzlies: Living with Wild Bears in Alaska, his mission to protect bears began in the late 1980s after surviving a near fatal heroin overdose. He claims in his book that his drug addiction grew from his alcoholism. A lover of animals since he was a child, Treadwell decided to travel to Alaska to watch bears after a close friend convinced him to do so. He wrote that after his first encounter with a wild bear, he knew he had found his calling in life, and that now his destiny was entwined with that of the bears. He attributed his recovery from drug and alcohol addictions entirely to his relationship with bears. ==Alaskan expeditions== From Grizzly Sanctuary to Grizzly Maze Treadwell spent the early part of each season camping on the \\"Big Green\\", an open area of bear grass in Hallo Bay on the Katmai Coast. He called the area \\"The Grizzly Sanctuary\\". Treadwell was known for getting extremely close to the bears he observed, sometimes even touching them and playing with bear cubs. However, in his book, he claimed that he was always careful with the bears and actually developed a sense of mutual trust and respect with the animals. He habitually named the bears he encountered and consistently saw many of the same bears each summer, and thus claimed to build a standing relationship with them. In contrast, Tom Smith, a research ecologist with the Alaska Science Center of the U.S. Geological Service declared that Treadwell \\"...was breaking every park rule that there was, in terms of distance to the bears, harassing wildlife and interfering with natural processes. Right off the bat, his personal mission was at odds with the park service. He had been warned repeatedly.\\" Referring to Treadwell's death, Smith concluded \\"It's a tragic thing, but it's not unpredictable.\\" During the later part of each summer he would move to Kaflia Bay and camp in an area of especially thick brush he called the \\"Grizzly Maze\\". Here the chances of crossing paths with grizzlies were much higher, since the location intersected bear trails. Treadwell recorded almost 100 hours of video footage (some of which was later used to create the documentary Grizzly Man) and produced a large collection of still photographs. Treadwell claimed to be alone with the wildlife on several occasions in his videos. However, his girlfriend Amie was with him during parts of the last three summers (the documentary says two summers) and at the time of their deaths. Other people possibly accompanied Treadwell during the other summer trips. By 2001, Treadwell became sufficiently notable to receive extensive media attention both on television and in environmental circles, and he made frequent public appearances as an environmental activist. He traveled throughout the United States to educate school children about bears and appeared on the Discovery Channel, the Late Show with David Letterman, and Dateline NBC to discuss his experiences. He also co-wrote Among Grizzlies: Living with Wild Bears in Alaska with Jewel Palovak (his co-worker with whom he lived for 20 years), which describes Treadwell's adventures on the Alaska Peninsula. Treadwell and Palovak founded Grizzly People, an organization devoted to protecting bears and preserving their wilderness habitat.Grizzly People Charlie Russell, who studied bears, raised them, and lived with them in Kamchatka, Russia, for a decade, worked with Treadwell. Russell advised Treadwell to carry pepper spray and use electric fences. He originally refrained from commenting on Treadwell after he was killed, but after Grizzly Man was released wrote a lengthy critique of Treadwell's failure to follow basic safety precautions. In spite of his criticism of Treadwell, Russell praised him for his devotion to bears and his ability remain alive for so long. He defended him against people who criticized his work, writing, \\"If Timothy had spent those thirteen years killing bears and guiding others to do the same, eventually being killed by one, he would have been remembered in Alaska with great admiration.\\" Russell was critical of the film Grizzly Man, saying it was unfair to Treadwell, and if Palovak \\"really was a protector of bears, she should have looked for a filmmaker who would have been sympathetic towards them.\\" According to the organization Treadwell founded, Grizzly People, five bears were poached in the year following his death, while none had been poached while he was present in Katmai. However, according to court records as reported by the Anchorage Daily News, the guilty parties were charged with poaching wildlife along Funnel Creek in the Preserve, an area open to hunting that borders the National Park. According to several sources, including Nick Jans' book, The Grizzly Maze, Treadwell camped only near the Katmai Coast, mainly in areas around Hallo Bay and Kaflia Bay, and never in or near the Preserve. The only effective way to patrol all of Katmai National Park is by airplane, the method used by authorities. == Conflicts with the National Park Service == Treadwell's years with the grizzlies were not without disruption. Almost from the start, the National Park Service expressed their worries about his behavior. The Park's restrictions made him increasingly irate. According to the file kept on Treadwell by the Park Service, rangers reported he had at least six violations from 1994 to 2003. Included among these violations were guiding tourists without a license, camping in the same area longer than the Park Service's seven-day limit, improper food storage, wildlife harassment, and conflicts with visitors and their guides. Treadwell also frustrated authorities by refusing to install an electric fence around his camp and refusing to carry bear spray to use as a deterrent. In fact, Treadwell had carried pepper spray with him and had resorted to using it at least one time, but wrote that he had felt terrible grief over the pain he perceived it had caused the bear and refused to use it on subsequent occasions. In 1998, park rangers issued Treadwell a citation for storing an ice chest filled with food in his tent. A separate incident involved rangers ordering him to remove a prohibited portable generator. When the Park Service imposed a new rule--often referred to as the \\"Treadwell Rule\\"--requiring all campers to move their camps at least one mile (1.6 km) every seven days, Treadwell initially obeyed the order by using a small motorboat to move his camp up and down the coast. Finding this method impractical, he later hid his camp from the Park Service in stands of trees with heavy brush. He was cited at least once for this violation. == Death == In October 2003, Treadwell and his girlfriend, physician assistant Amie Huguenard (born October 23, 1965, in Buffalo, New York), visited Katmai National Park, which is on the Alaska Peninsula across Shelikof Strait from Kodiak Island. In Grizzly Man, Werner Herzog states that according to Treadwell's diaries, Huguenard feared bears and felt very uncomfortable in their presence. Her final journal entries indicated that she wanted to be away from Katmai. Treadwell chose to set his campsite near a salmon stream where grizzlies commonly feed in autumn. Treadwell was in the park later in the year than normal, at a time when bears attempt to gain as much fat as possible before winter. Food was scarce that fall, causing the grizzly bears to be even more aggressive than usual. Treadwell was to leave the park at his usual time of year but extended his stay a week in an effort to locate a favorite female brown bear. He said he hated modern civilization and felt better in nature with the bears than he did in big cities around humans. The bears he had been used to during the summer had already gone into hibernation, and bears that Treadwell did not know from other parts of the park were moving into the area. Some of the last footage taken by Treadwell, hours before his death, includes video of a bear diving into the river repeatedly for a piece of dead salmon. Treadwell mentioned in the footage that he did not feel entirely comfortable around that particular bear. In Grizzly Man, Herzog speculates on whether Treadwell filmed the very bear that killed him. Diagram of attack site showing positions of bodies. Longitude incorrectly marked as East rather than West. Around noon on Sunday, October 5, 2003, Treadwell spoke with an associate in Malibu, California, by satellite phone; Treadwell mentioned no problems with any bears. The next day, October 6, Willy Fulton, a Kodiak air taxi pilot, arrived at Treadwell and Huguenard's campsite to pick them up but found the area abandoned, except for a bear, and contacted the local park rangers. The couple's mangled remains were discovered quickly upon investigation. Treadwell's disfigured head, partial spine, and right forearm and hand, with his wristwatch still on, were recovered a short distance from the camp. Huguenard's partial remains were found next to the torn and collapsed tents, partially buried in a mound of twigs and dirt. A large male grizzly (tagged Bear 141) protecting the campsite was killed by park rangers during their attempt to retrieve the bodies. A second adolescent bear was also killed a short time later, when it charged the park rangers. An on-site necropsy of Bear 141 revealed human body parts such as fingers and limbs. The younger bear was consumed by other animals before it could be necropsied. In the 85-year history of Katmai National Park, this was the first known incident of a person being killed by a bear. A video camera was recovered at the site that proved to have been operating during the attack, but police said that the six-minute tape contained only voices and cries as a brown bear mauled Treadwell to death. The tape begins with Treadwell yelling that he is being attacked. \\"Come out here; I'm being killed out here,\\" he screams. That the tape contained only sound led troopers to believe the attack might have happened while the camera was stuffed in a duffel bag or during the dark of night. In Grizzly Man, filmmaker Herzog claims that the lens cap of the camera was left on, suggesting that Treadwell and Huguenard were in the process of setting up for another video sequence when the attack happened. The camera had been turned on just before the attack, presumably by sound activation, but the camera recorded only six minutes of audio before running out of tape. This, however, was enough time to record the bear's initial attack on Treadwell and his agonized screams, its retreat after Huguenard tells Treadwell to play dead and when she attacked it and its return to carry Treadwell off into the forest. == Media attention == * Grizzly Man (2005), directed by Werner Herzog, is a documentary about Treadwell's work with wildlife in Alaska. Released theatrically by Lions Gate Films, it later was telecast on the Discovery Channel. Treadwell's own footage is featured, along with interviews with people who knew him. Although Herzog praises Treadwell's video footage, he disagrees with his view of nature as harmonious. Treadwell's anthropomorphic treatment of wild animals is apparent in the documentary. * The Grizzly Man Diaries is an eight-episode mini-series that premiered on August 29, 2008, on Animal Planet and is a spin-off of Grizzly Man. Produced by Creative Differences, the series chronicles the last 10 years of Treadwell's life with diary entries, and footage and photographs taken by Treadwell during his expeditions. == See also == * Bear attack * List of fatal bear attacks in North America * Lillian Alling * Christopher McCandless, subject of Jon Krakauer‚Äôs book Into the Wild (1996), later adapted as a 2007 film directed by Sean Penn * Carl McCunn, wildlife photographer who became stranded in the Alaskan wilderness and eventually committed suicide when he ran out of supplies (1981) * Lars Monsen, Norwegian adventurer and TV personality who once traveled by foot, canoe, and dog sled from the east coast of Canada to the west coast, a project which took over two years to complete * Richard Proenneke, who survived in the Alaskan wilderness for 30 years * Everett Ruess, who disappeared in the Utah wilderness in 1934 * Sankebetsu brown bear incident (1915), the worst bear attack in Japanese history, in which seven people were killed * Ed Wardle, who documented his solo wilderness adventure in the 2009 television series Alone in the Wild * Backcountry (film), film based upon a real life story. == References Further reading== * Conesa-Sevilla, J.

It is locally known most simply by the common names of culebr√≥n, which basically means 'big snake', or more specifically as the boa puertorrique√±a. For publications in English either the names Puerto Rican boa or yellow tree boa have been promoted, although it is not yellow, nor does it live in trees: it is a terrestrial snake with a dark brown coloration. It grows to in length. It feeds on small mammals such as rodents and bats, birds and sometimes anole lizards. Like all boas, it is viviparous (bearing live young) and kills its prey using constriction, squeezing its victims to death. ==Taxonomy== It is extremely similar to the Jamaican species Epicrates subflavus which was seen as the same species for some fifty years until it was split from this species in 1901 by Leonhard Hess Stejneger. The taxon Piesigaster boettgeri was described from Mindanao, the Philippines, by the Spaniard :es:V√≠ctor L√≥pez Seoane in 1881, but was identified as a synonym of this species by Stejneger. Seoane's brother was an officer in the Spanish Navy and thus the localities of the group of specimens Seoane had obtained doubtlessly got confused during their passage to Spain. Although it has been known under the name E. inornatus for over a century, having been moved to the genus Epicrates (which had been created in 1830 by Johann Georg Wagler) by the Belgian zoologist George Albert Boulenger in 1893 when cataloguing the specimens in the Natural History Museum, London, a number of authors decided to it move to Chilabothrus inornatus in 2013. It had first been moved to Chilabothrus inornatus from the genus Boa in 1844 by either the French herpetologists Andr√© Marie Constant Dum√©ril and Gabriel Bibron, or the Italian snake expert Giorgio Jan, only a year after it had been described in that genus by the Dane Johannes Theodor Reinhardt in 1843. Reinhardt had three snakes of this species to study for his description, these are the syntypes and are stored in Copenhagen. They were collected by a certain Dr. Ravn from Puerto Rico. It is often still known as Epicrates inornatus in many publications. ===Etymology=== The generic epithet epicrates is derived from the Ancient Greek word ·ºêœÄŒπŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒÆœÇ, meaning 'powerful', and the specific epithet inornatus is from the Latin negation of ornatus, meaning 'adorned', thus the boa is 'unadorned'. ==Description== A characteristic of this species are the irregular parietal scales. It can grow to some , with 261 to 271 ventral scales and 67 to 75 caudal scales, according to Stejneger in 1904, who only knew of at least twelve specimens at the time. The colours of the three live specimens he knew of were variable; two he describes as \\"bistre\\" (deep, dark, grayish brown), the other as \\"chestnut\\" with a darker colour near the tail, the first had a darker ventral surface, the second he describes as \\"slate\\" coloured, and the last had a lighter slate- brown underside with the ventral scales having paler edges. The first was patterned with seventy to eighty indistinct dusky cross bars consisting of a row of spots, these cross bars increasing in width to the end of the snake; in the second these patterns were much more distinct, with the crossbars having pale centres but being outlined in blackish colour, the lateral spots being so aligned as to form a blackish line in the front third of its body, but in the last snake there was little evidence of patterning with only a few scattered and obscure darkish spots on its sides. The iris he describes as \\"silvery gray clouded with dusky\\". It grows to in total length. ===Similar species=== Puerto Rico has very few snakes for a Caribbean island of its size, besides this species there are Alsophis portoricensis and Arrhyton exiguum and a number of very small blindsnakes of the genus Typhlops, and this is the largest species by far. The only other species of Epicrates in the area is Epicrates monensis. In that species the supraocular scales are about one half as broad as the frontal scales, whereas in this species the supraoculars are about one third as broad as the frontal scales. ==Distribution== The Puerto Rican boa is endemic to the island of Puerto Rico.Schwartz A, Thomas R. 1975. A Check-list of West Indian Amphibians and Reptiles. Carnegie Museum of Natural History Special Publication No. 1. Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: Carnegie Museum of Natural History. 216 pp. (Epicrates inornatus, p. 185). ==EcologyHabitat=== It is found in wooded and rocky places in the foothills. It is more common in the northwest and in the karst regions which are found along the northern coast of the island. ===Diet=== The boa feeds by seizing the prey in its jaws, wrapping several coils around the victim, and then constricting until the prey has suffocated. The prey is then swallowed head first. The feeding habits of the very young are unknown. However, locals claim they eat small lizards, other small vertebrates and some insects. This species is a sit-and-wait predator as opposed to an active hunter of prey. It is a nocturnal, terrestrial hunter which is not found often in trees. The dissections of 72 snakes from the West Indies show that while young boas of the genus Epicrates feed primarily on anoles, mature boas (with the exception of Epicrates gracilis) feed for some 60% on mammals combined, which distinguishes them ecologically from the other three genera of snakes on the island. Birds constitute some 10% of the diet. The rest of the prey items are composed of Anolis lizards and a very small amount of frogs. They also prey on much larger-sized prey than the other snakes. Half of the mammals are non- native species of mice (Mus) and rats (Rattus), it is suspected that the original prey was other small mammals such as Nesophontes, Brotomys and Isolobodon before the introduction of these species. Bats constitute the other half. Newborn snakes may possibly feed on geckos. It is thought that this species in particular feeds less on anoles and more on birds, rodents and bats. Since the karst region where the Puerto Rican boa lives usually has many caves, the boa has the opportunity to feed on bats -a phenomenon which was previously seen in other Epicrates species. Observations in the 1980s revealed that boas capture the bats in flight by hanging at the opening of the cave, waiting until bats fly out of it. They then grab a bat with their jaws before killing it via constriction. ===Reproduction=== Pregnant females give birth to about 23-26 live boas. ==Conservation== Historic records, some dating back to the 18th century, indicate that during the first few centuries of Spanish colonization in Puerto Rico the boa was relatively abundant, and oil produced from the snake's fat was utilized extensively as an export (see snake oil). Impacts to the boa resulting from the oil trade were undoubtedly heightened by a concurrent reduction of habitat. Deforestation of the island began during this period and continued until, by the early 20th century, very little natural forest remained. Predation by the mongoose, introduced into Puerto Rico in the 19th century, has been postulated as a further cause for the boa's present status, but there is no direct evidence to support this idea. In 1904 Stejneger mentions that during his time the snake was rather rare, he himself, as well as a number of other collecting parties in the newly acquired territory, were unable to see one during their expeditions on the island, although a trail of one was seen. Other collecting parties were able to collect five specimens in 1900 and in those first few years the island became a possession of the United States, and bring these to the mainland, almost doubling the specimens known at the time. In the previous century only six other specimens had been secured, these were all in Europe -one in Milan (used by Jan), one in Paris (studied by Dum√©ril and Bibron from Bayamon, there was also a second specimen from Haiti, but this one is now thought to have been misidentified), two or more somewhere in Spain (those of Seoane supposedly from Mindanao), and the three original syntypes used by Reinhardt in Copenhagen. After the invasion and annexation of the territory by the United States a few years before Stejneger and numerous other Americans were able to collect on the island, there was a subsequent economic decline due of the loss of traditional agricultural markets for sugar, and much of the forests have regrown on the island. There is an indication that the boa has recovered somewhat in recent years, although not to the degree that protective measures can be dropped. To prevent its extinction, a few conservation efforts have been attempted, including a conservation area for it in Bosque Estatal San Patricio in Guaynabo. ==See also== *List of reptiles of Puerto Rico *Fauna of Puerto Rico *List of endemic fauna of Puerto Rico ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Reinhardt JT. 1843. \\"Beskrivelse af Nogle nye Slangearter \\".

There is also a souvenir shop which sells items from charitable foundations and social welfare organisations which used to be under her patronage; the profits go to help the poor and the destitute. The park is in Khlong San District, close to the banks of the Chao Phraya River, near the south end of Phra Pok Klao Bridge, on Soi Somdet Chao Phraya 3, next to the Kuan Ou Shrine.

The activity has existed in England and Wales since at least the 17th century and has a colourful legal history. It differs from prostitution in that the parties involved do not seek money for sex, and from gay nightclubs or bathhouses in that they are not on private premises, although they may take place on private land to which the public have been granted access. ==History and origins== The history of gay cruising is sparsely documented, as the illegality of gay sex meant that those who used such cruising grounds were likely to be discreet about them. Rictor Norton, author of Mother Clap's Molly House (a reference to Margaret Clap), is one of the few historians to address the topic. He believes that the first gay cruising grounds and gay brothels in London may have sprung up in the early 17th century; theatres were sometimes denounced as such by moralists of the time. So-called \\"cruising grounds\\" or \\"cruising sites\\", where gay and bisexual men meet at a public place to cruise for sex, originated in the late 1600s (from the earliest known records, although it most likely originated much earlier) and has continued to the present day. Cruising came about owing to the illegality of homosexual acts in the United Kingdom. Prior to the Sexual Offences Act 1967, this illegality meant that many gay men could not live openly as homosexuals. Cruising provided a way for gay men to solicit sexual encounters while minimizing the risk of being caught by the police. When cruising first became known, it usually took place in public fields, parks, toilets (or \\"cottages\\" as they would become known as in the 20th century). In more recent times, public lay-bys located either on or off main roads or rural roads have also become popular sites. Gay beat is an Australian term. ===Legal history=== Before the 20th century, anal sex, whether conducted in public or private, was illegal under sodomy laws, including the Buggery Act set down by Henry VIII in 1533. The penalty for anal intercourse during most of this period was death; however, specific proof of successful anal penetration was required for this verdict to be brought. The lesser crime of \\"gross indecency\\" carried penalties including the pillory (as in the case of the Vere Street Coterie, who were arrested in a raid of a gay club in 1811), transportation and imprisonment. The death penalty for anal sex was lifted in 1861. An 1885 law prohibited \\"gross indecency\\", which included all erotic conduct between men. Eventually, in 1967, some of the Wolfenden Report's recommendations of a decade earlier led to the decriminalisation of homosexual sex in private; no such legal privilege pertains to sex in public places, either for homosexual or heterosexual sex. Therefore, despite more tolerance in the law and society at large, gay men have continued to be at risk of prosecution for public sex. A number of well known people have been arrested for sex in public places in England and Wales, including: * Simeon Solomon, a painter who was arrested in a London toilet in 1873 with a 60-year-old stableman. He was also later arrested in France for a similar offence. * Tom Driberg, later an MP, who was charged with indecent assault after two men shared his bed in the 1940s. He later used his position as a journalist several times to get off charges when caught soliciting in public toilets by the police. * Actor Wilfrid Brambell, known for appearing in Steptoe and Son, was arrested in a toilet in Shepherd's Bush on 6 November 1962. * Peter Dudley, an actor in Coronation Street who played Ivy Tilsley's husband, was arrested in 1981 in a toilet in Didsbury, Manchester. * Actor Sir John Gielgud was arrested for \\"importuning\\" in 1953 in Chelsea. * William J. Field, (Member of Parliament), was arrested for persistently importuning in a public toilet in 1953. Field appealed against the conviction twice but failed on both occasions. * Record producer Joe Meek, arrested in a toilet in Islington in 1963. * Michael Turnbull was arrested in Hull for cottaging in a public toilet in 1968, before he became Bishop of Durham. * Actor Peter Wyngarde, arrested (under his real name, Cyril Louis Goldbert) in Gloucester bus station public toilets in September 1975 for gross indecency with Richard Jack Whalley. He was fined ¬£75. * Stedman Pearson of the pop group Five Star, arrested in a toilet in New Malden in 1990. The playwright Joe Orton wrote in his posthumously published diaries of his regular cottaging, but he did not incur prosecution. ===Areas with a history of gay cruising=== lists a number of London cruising grounds during the Georgian era. These included St. James's Park, Moorfields, the public privies at Lincoln's Inn, and Smithfield prior to the Gordon Riots. Hampstead Heath in north London has a long history of gay cruising, which was accompanied by police arrests and attacks. From the late 1990s, this evolved into minimal active policing, and support from gay sexual health organisations. During an interview on BBC News 24, the singer George Michael, who was allegedly caught cruising on Hampstead Heath by News of the World photographers, claimed that his cruising was de facto private because it occurred at 2am. In 1992, Conservative MP Alan Amos resigned his parliamentary seat after he was found by the police \\"engaging in a homosexual act\\" on the Heath. Clapham Common in south London is well-known for gay cruising. The Labour MP Ron Davies resigned from the government after national newspapers reported that he was attacked and robbed by a man whom he met on the Common. A number of homophobic attacks have occurred around the area, including the murder of Jody Dobrowski. The gay-themed TV drama Clapham Junction was based around the lives of gay men in the area and included scenes of cruising and cottaging. ==Current situation== The Sexual Offences Act 2003 prohibits all forms of sexual activity in a public lavatory, but has nothing to say about other forms of cruising. However, persons of any gender who engage in sexual intercourse in public can find themselves charged with offences under the Public Order Act 1986, if the police have sufficient evidence to convince a court of law that the activity was witnessed by a third party, or there was a high likelihood of the activity being witnessed by a third party. Presently, there is an active population of men who visit cruising grounds, which include parks, picnic areas and lay-bys where sex takes place in the bushes or other sheltered areas. These areas exist in all parts of Britain, including isolated rural areas. The attitude of the police to cruising at any given location varies, according to the time of the day or night, and the level of public concern measured by the number of complaints from local residents and councillors. Occasionally, police community support officers will visit a cruising area during the early hours of the morning with the intention of advising cruisers of the risk of homophobic attacks, and any persons seen to be involved in sexual behavior will be asked to move on rather than being arrested. A number of police forces actively participate in on-line discussions with cruisers in order to gather information on hate crimes and to discourage them from using locations about which complaints have been received. The current trend for gay cruising has been bolstered by a continued use of online media. Apps and websites including Grindr, Cruizerz.com and Squirt.org make arranged cruising possible, although this has been a source of questionable safety, with Russian gangs having been found to use such media to lure gay men into dangerous situations. ==See also== *Dogging *Squirt.org ==ReferencesAdditional sources=== * Category:LGBT history in England Category:LGBT in Wales Category:Casual sex Category:Gay history ","title":"Gay cruising in England and Wales"},{"id":"2221696","text":"The Fiat Panorama is a two-door station wagon version of the Fiat 147, a subcompact car produced in South America by Italian automaker Fiat. The Panorama was built in Brazil and released in March 1980 as one of the first small station wagons to be produced there. The Panorama was phased out in 1986 to give its market to Elba/Duna Weekend. Some current cars available in that market were the Volkswagen Brasilia, Volkswagen Variant, Ford Belina and Chevrolet Caravan. Some time later, there were Chevrolet Maraj√≥ (end of 1980) and Volkswagen Parati (1982). The mechanicals of the 147 were adapted for a heavier weight. The appeal of Panorama was the economy of space and fuel. The length was the smaller of all Brazilian wagons (3924 mm/154 in) but the internal space was equivalent to the bigger ones. In order to create more room space, the spare tire was placed along with the engine, as in 147. The light weight allowed a small fuel consumption either of gasoline or alcohol. It was sold in three engine options: a 1048 cc gasoline with a maximum output of 56 hp (42 kW) and a 1297 cc gasoline or alcohol with a maximum output of 60 hp (45 kW) and 61 hp (46 kW) respectively. The two trim levels were C and CL.

The title ealdorman is Anglo-Saxon, while earl comes from Old Norse eorl. The ealdormanry (earldom) seems to have been created in 966 following a period when the region was under the control of Oswulf, already high-reeve of Bamburgh in northern Northumbria, from about 954, when Norse rule at York came to an end.

He is best known for his powerful soulful voice and his energetic virtuosity on the Hammond organ, peaking in 1971 with his Top 10 pop hit single, \\"Do You Know What I Mean\\". ==Career== Michaels began his career with The Sentinals, a San Luis Obispo, California-based surf group that included drummer Johny Barbata (later of The Turtles, Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship). Michaels joined Barbata in the Joel Scott Hill Trio, a group led by guitarist Joel Scott Hill. Michaels later moved to San Francisco, where he joined an early version of The Family Tree, a band led by Bob Segarini.Richie Unterberger, Liner Notes for Roxy's Roxy; Richieunterberger.com. In 1967, he signed a contract with A&M; Records, releasing his debut album, Carnival of Life, later that year with David Potter on drums. As a session musician, he played with Jimi Hendrix, among others. Michaels' choice of the Hammond organ as his primary instrument was unusual for the time, as was his bare-bones stage and studio accompaniment: usually just a single drummer, most often a musician known as \\"Frosty,\\" real name Bartholomew Eugene Smith-Frost, who was a member of Sweathog, and whose bare handed technique was an inspiration for John Bonham,Bartholomew Eugene Smith-Frost is based in Texas, where he continues to perform as Barry Smith or B.E. \\"Frosty\\" Smith. Experience Summary ; Soulhat.net; Biography of Barry Smith; Frostysmith.tripod.com. or with Joel Larson of The Grass Roots. This unorthodox approach attracted a following in San Francisco, and some critical notice. (Sounds Magazine, for one, reported of Michaels that he had been called \\"the ultimate power organist.\\") But Michaels did not achieve real commercial success until the release of his fifth album. That album, titled 5th and released in 1971, produced a surprise US Top 10 hit (#6 in the fall of 1971), \\"Do You Know What I Mean.\\" It was an autobiographical homage to the loss of a girlfriend. Michaels's Top 40 follow- up, a cover version of the Motown standard, \\"Can I Get a Witness,\\" peaked at #39 on Christmas Day of 1971, eight years to the week after Marvin Gaye's version peaked at #22. Billboard ranked \\"Do You Know What I Mean\\" as the No. 19 song for 1971. Michaels recorded two more albums for A&M; before signing a recording contract with Columbia Records in 1973. But his Columbia recordings failed to generate much interest, and Michaels had gone into semi-retirement from the music industry by the end of the decade. In 1991, Michaels obtained full rights to all of his A&M; recordings in a settlement of disputes that had arisen from A&M; granting licenses to Delicious Vinyl for the use of Michaels's recordings by means of digital sampling on several Young MC recordings. Once he had regained full ownership rights, Michaels granted licenses to Rhino Records and Shout Factory to release several \\"best of\\" albums over the years. In November 2015, Manifesto Records released his entire catalog of A&M; recordings on compact disc and vinyl in February 2016. ==DiscographyStudio albums and live album=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" Title ! rowspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"width:15em;\\" Details ! rowspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" United States ! rowspan=\\"1\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" Australia - ! scope=\\"row\\" Carnival of Life  * Release date: 1968 * Label: A&M; * Formats: LP  ‚Äî  ‚Äî - - ! scope=\\"row\\" Recital  * Release date: 1968 * Label: A&M; * Formats: LP  ‚Äî  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" Lee Michaels  * Release date: 1969 * Label: A&M; * Formats: LP  53  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" Barrel  * Release date: 1970 * Label: A&M; * Formats: LP  51  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" 5th  * Release date: 1971 * Label: A&M; * Formats: LP  16  38 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Space and First Takes  * Release date: 1972 * Label: A&M; * Formats: LP  78  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" Lee Michaels Live  * Release date: 1973 * Label: A&M; 2 LP * Formats: LP  135  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" Nice Day for Something  * Release date: 1973 * Label: Columbia * Formats: LP  172  ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\" Tailface  * Release date: 1974 * Label: Columbia * Formats: LP  ‚Äî  ‚Äî -  colspan=\\"15\\" style=\\"font-size:8pt\\" \\"‚Äî\\" denotes releases that did not chart - }Absolute Lee Release date: 1983 Label: Squish Formats: LP ===Singles=== {  style=text- align:center; - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Year !rowspan=\\"2\\"Title !colspan=\\"2\\"Peak chart positions !rowspan=\\"2\\"Record Label !rowspan=\\"2\\"B-side !rowspan=\\"2\\"Album - style=\\"font-size:smaller;\\" !align=centre US !align=centre AUS - rowspan=\\"2\\" 1968 align=left \\"Love\\"  --  -- rowspan=\\"8\\" A&M; Records  \\"Sounding the Sleeping\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" Carnival of Life - align=left \\"If I Lose You\\"  --  --  \\"My Friends\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" Recital - rowspan=\\"2\\" 1969 align=left \\"Goodbye, Goodbye\\"  --  --  \\"The War\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" - align=left \\"Heighty Hi\\"  106  47  \\"Want My Baby\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" Lee Michaels - rowspan=\\"1\\" 1970 align=left \\"What Now America\\"  --  --  \\"Uummmm My Lady\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" Barrel - rowspan=\\"2\\" 1971 align=left \\"Do You Know What I Mean\\"  6  26  \\"Keep the Circle Turning\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" 5th - align=left \\"Can I Get a Witness\\"  39  --  \\"You Are What You Do\\" - rowspan=\\"1\\" 1972 align=left \\"Hold on to Freedom\\"  --  --  \\"Own Special Way (As Long As)\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" Space and First Takes - rowspan=\\"2\\" 1973 align=left \\"Same Old Song\\"  --  -- rowspan=\\"1\\" Columbia Records  \\"Rock and Roll Community\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" Nice Day for Something - align=left \\"Rock Me Baby\\"  --  -- rowspan=\\"1\\" A&M; Records  \\"Heighty Hi\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" 5th - } ==References * [ Lee Michaels Biography on allmusic.com] * Lee Michaels MySpace tribute page * Archive.org version of LeeMichaels.com (aka 'lee michaels personal web site') 2009-2015 Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:American male singers Category:American singers Category:A&M; Records artists Category:Columbia Records artists Category:ABC Records artists Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American rock keyboardists Category:American organists Category:American male organists Category:American rock pianists Category:American male pianists Category:American rock guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:20th-century American pianists Category:21st-century American keyboardists Category:21st-century American pianists Category:21st-century organists Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:21st-century American male musicians Category:20th-century American keyboardists ","title":"Lee Michaels"},{"id":"2221707","text":"The Castells were a male vocal quartet from Santa Rosa, California best remembered for their hits \\"Sacred\\" (No. 20 in 1961) and \\"So This Is Love\\" (No. 21 in 1962), both released on Era Records.Joel Whitburn, The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits. 7th edn, 2000 Their sound blended light rock with elements of collegiate vocal harmony and jazz ==History== The Castells were formed at Santa Rosa High School around 1959. They were booked for a performance at a local teenage \\"canteen\\". They did not have a name and their pianist, Jeff Bush, suggested one. It had no meaning other than they thought that it sounded good, and the intent was to be more thoughtful and change it later. Through a Santa Rosa KJAX disc jockey who went by the name of Dan Dillon, they got Hollywood contacts. Girard's mother financed a demo for a hundred dollars, which was recorded in a San Francisco studio. They took their demo and went door-to-door in Hollywood, first to Crystalette Records, which seemed to be defunct, Aladdin Records, and then Era Records. They were excited that Aladdin seemed interested, as they considered themselves to be R&B;, but eventually it was Era who signed them. Their first release \\"Little Sad Eyes\\", went to \\"Bubbling Under\\" on the Billboard chart, then came \\"Sacred\\", which reached the charts. \\"Make Believe Wedding\\" went \\"Bubbling Under\\", then \\"So This Is Love\\" again charted. They played shows for a few years, and share the stage with Jackie Wilson, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bobby Vee, and Brenda Lee. They never charted again but did continue to record for a few years, first for Warner Bros. Records and then Decca Records. They disbanded around 1964. Chuck Girard later joined the surf rock group The Hondells and in the 1970s became a popular CCM artist. ==Members== thumbFinal group members: Van Krugel, Kelly, Hicks, Girard Castells live: Van Krugel, Girard, Kelly, Hicks The band's members were Chuck Girard, Tom Hicks, Warren Hays, Bob Ussery, and Jeff Bush. Bush didn't sing. He played piano on all the gigs. Hays left when the group was signed by Era Records. The group planned to move from Santa Rosa to southern California. Hays, a minor, was not allowed to move with the boys, and his parents also objected on religious grounds. When Hays left, Joe Kelly replaced him. When the group signed with Era Records, label president Herb Newman insisted on session pianists, and Jeff Bush was edged out. In 1963 Bob Ussery got married, left the group, and moved out of California. He was temporarily replaced by Greg Van Krugel, Chuck Girard's roommate and high school friend, because he knew the material from attending rehearsals. After a few live performances as a substitute, he was elected to permanent membership. By late 1964, The Castells were still recording and doing public appearances, but their popularity was waning. By 1965 the group members remained friends and went their separate ways. Most often produced by Gary Usher of surf & hot rod rock fame, Chuck Girard and Joe Kelly went on to record as a duo under their real names, Chuck and Joe, recording blue-eyed soul covers of earlier popular songs like \\"Harlem Shuffle\\" and \\"Feel So Fine.\\" They recorded a few edgy pop-folk singles as the Devons. They worked for Usher for several years and recorded a number of hot rod and surf albums under many different group identities. Tom Hicks began a family with a new wife and went on to become a successful businessman in southern California. Greg Van Krugel also married. He was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1966. In 1968, after active duty, he returned to his wife and daughter in southern California and made his career in the defense and aerospace electronics industry. Other performers of note with which the Castells shared the stage include Bobby Rydell, Dick and Dee Dee, Jan and Dean, The Beach Boys, The Righteous Brothers. The Rivingtons, Donnie Brooks, Dobie Gray, Gary Lewis & The Playboys, Ted Neely and Larry Verne. Session musicians the Castells worked with later became known as \\"The Wrecking Crew\\". They included Billy Strange (guitar), Barney Kessel (guitar), Ray Pohlman (bass & arranger of one of the group's sessions), Frankie Capp, Plas Johnson (saxophone), Glen Campbell (guitar), and Hal Blaine (drums). ==Discography== *A: Little Sad Eyes B: Romeo 1961 *A: Life Goes on B: I Thought You'd Like That 1966 ==References * Chuck Girard's official website Category:Musical groups from California Category:Era Records artists ","title":"The Castells"},{"id":"2221712","text":"John Ignatius Armstrong AC (10 July 1908 ‚Äì 10 March 1977) was an Australian politician and diplomat. He served as a Senator for New South Wales from 1938 to 1962, representing the Labor Party, and was a minister in the Chifley Government. Armstrong later served as Lord Mayor of Sydney from 1965 to 1967, and then as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1973 to 1974. ==Early life== Armstrong was born into a large Roman Catholic family in the Sydney suburb of Ultimo to William and Ellen (n√©e Hannan) Armstrong, both emigrants from Ireland. He was educated at St Bede's School, Pyrmont, and at the Marist Brothers' High School, Darlinghurst. In 1934, he was elected as an alderman of Sydney Municipal Council, representing the Labor Party until 1948.Edmund Campion, 'Armstrong, John Ignatius (1908‚Äì1977)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/armstrong-john-ignatius-9384/text16487, published first in hardcopy 1993, accessed online 28 April 2017. ==Political career== Armstrong was selected for Labor's slate of candidates for the Australian Senate for the 1937 election partly because his name would appear high on the alphabetic ballot and he was duly elected, effective from July 1938. He married Joan Therese Josephine Curran in October 1945. During 1945, Prime Minister John Curtin's health greatly deteriorated but politicians and the media declined to publicly discuss Curtin's health for fear of concerning the Australian public during World War II. As a result, Armstrong gave a speech in the Senate on 13 June which included the first public reference to Curtin's health, and left the Australian public surprised.Abjorensen, N. (2016) The Manner of Their Going, Australian Scholarly Publishing: Kew. , p. 108. He was appointed Minister for Munitions in Ben Chifley's November 1946 ministry. In April 1948, his portfolio was merged with the Supply functions of Bill Ashley's portfolio to create the portfolio of Supply and Development and he was attacked by the opposition for the breadth of his powers. Following Labor's defeat at the 1949 election, he became deputy-leader of the Opposition in the Senate. He was relegated to an unwinnable fourth position on Labor's ticket for the 1961 election and left parliament in July 1962. ==Later life== Armstrong was elected Lord Mayor of Sydney in 1966, but the position was abolished by the Askin government in 1967. The Whitlam government appointed him Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1973 to 1974. In 1977, he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia. He died of a myocardial infarction in Batemans Bay, aged 68, survived by his wife, a son and four daughters. ==References== Category:1908 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Australian people of Irish descent Category:Companions of the Order of Australia Category:High Commissioners of Australia to the United Kingdom Category:Permanent Representatives of Australia to the International Maritime Organization Category:Members of the Australian Senate for New South Wales Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:Members of the Cabinet of Australia Category:Mayors and Lord Mayors of Sydney Category:Lang Labor members of the Parliament of Australia Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"John Armstrong (Australian politician)"},{"id":"2221723","text":"Mother Goose and Grimm, also known as Grimmy for the second season, is an American animated television series that premiered September 14, 1991, on CBS.

Not only are the distances large, but at such depths the formations holding the hydrocarbons create pressures over and temperatures of . Prior to Thunder Horse, no field had ever been developed at such a depth. Following lengthy delays caused by the need to repair and replace components in the subsea system (following a failure during pre- commissioning checks), \\"First oil\\" came on June 14, 2008. Since then, Thunder Horse has steadily ramped up its production by bringing on new wells. In March 2009, Thunder Horse produced close to oil equivalent in oil and natural gas from seven wells. Plans were in place to add two additional wells in 2009 to further develop the north end of the field.

Thunder Horse was completed at Kiewit Offshore Services in nearby Ingleside, Texas. Thunder Horse PDQ was evacuated with the approach of Hurricane Dennis in July 2005. after the hurricane passed, the platform was listing badly. The platform was designed for a 100-year event, and inspection teams found no hull damage, and no water was taken on from a leak through its hull. Rather, an incorrectly plumbed, 6-inch length of pipe allowed water to flow freely among several ballast tanks that set forth a chain of events causing the platform to tip into the water. The platform was fully righted about a week after Dennis, delaying commercial production initially scheduled for late 2005. During repairs, it was discovered that the underwater manifold was severely cracked due to poorly welded pipes. The rig's design engineer, Gordon Aaker, said that the cracked manifold could have caused a catastrophic oil spill.Lyall, Sarah. In BP‚Äôs Record, a History of Boldness and Costly Blunders.

The core members of the Ancients were Samuel Palmer, George Richmond, and Edward Calvert. Except for Palmer, the central members who were artists were all students at the Royal Academy of Arts. They met in Blake's apartment, dubbed the \\"House of Interpreter\\"Timothy Wilcox, Samuel Palmer (London: Tate, 2005), 18. and at the home of Samuel Palmer in the Kent village of Shoreham. The Ancients made little impact on the English artistic scene during the ten years or so that the group continued, but several members were later significant artists, and interest in the group has gradually increased since the late 19th-century. They were the first English manifestation of the formalised artistic \\"brotherhood\\", an artistic movement whose aims included elements of communal living and promotion of a general vision for society. Continental groups of this sort included the German Nazarene movement and the Barbus in Paris, and the most successful later English example was to be the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Like these groups they represented an oppositional break-away from the academic art establishment, and looked back to an idealized version of the past. They pursued equality among their members as a reaction to the hierarchical structure of the conventional art world. Like Nazarenes and Barbus, they promoted the wearing of special revivalist costume, though only Palmer seems often to have worn it in practice; it seems to be shown in some portraits of Palmer by Richmond such as the bust-length miniature and chalk drawing (1829, both National Portrait Gallery), which shows a round-necked pleated smock under a coat with a loose untidy collar and lapels, combined with somewhat Christ-like long hair and a beard.Vaughan, 17‚Äì20, 105‚Äì106, 129; see also drawings at Yale on Wikimedia Commons The Ancients were probably aware of the Nazarenes, but probably not of the Barbus.Vaughan, 18‚Äì19 argues they must have known of the Nazarenes; though Paley, 99‚Äì100, is not so sure. ==Group aims and activity== George Richmond drawing of Samuel Palmer wearing \\"Ancient\\" clothing, 1830 Unlike Blake they were mostly High Tory in politics, but equally distrustful of the modern mercantile society booming around them, and looked back to an idealized ruralist past. They never produced a manifesto, and their activities and relationships are poorly documented; Palmer's son later destroyed most of his father's papers from the period, hinting darkly that they contained sexual material showing \\"a mental condition ... full of danger, and neither sufficiently masculine nor sufficiently reticent\\". Most of the information about the group's activities and dynamics comes from memoirs by them or their families and friends recalled several decades later.Vaughan, 18‚Äì21, 20 quoted Their name may have come from John Giles, Palmer's stockbroker cousin, who despite being no artist was an important figure in the group and perhaps the initial instigator, as Palmer's son suggested. He is recorded as very often extolling the superiority of \\"the ancients\\" in any context that occurred in conversation, though the word is also an important one for Blake.Paley, 98‚Äì99; Vaughan, 18, 105 At this period \\"ancient\\" was a vaguer term than in modern English, often used to refer to the medieval or even Renaissance, as in the English legal term \\"Ancient Monument\\". Christiana Payne, in the Grove Dictionary of Art, states, > \\"Their subject-matter was drawn from the Bible, or from a vision of a golden > age of pastoral innocence and abundance that had both Christian and > Vergilian overtones.\\"Oxford Art Online, Subscription only: > http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T002673 The artist members submitted works for the Royal Academy exhibitions, many of which were exhibited, but these \\"stimulated no critical enthusiasm and were evidently not considered sufficiently threatening to provoke outrage, as the Pre-Raphaelites were to do a generation later\\". None of the exhibited works seem to have been sold, and the group received very few commissions for works in \\"Ancient\\" style, though Richmond's successful career as a conventional portraitist took off in the early 1830s.Vaughan, 20‚Äì21, 20 quoted Nor did the people of Shoreham seem to take objection to Palmer and his visitors, though he records they were known by some locals as the Extollagers, an attempt at \\"astrologers\\". Palmer added other local properties to his house there, which he rented out for the rest of his life.Vaughan, 19‚Äì20 Both the Nazarene Brotherhood and the Barbus were able to attempt communal living in abandoned monasteries outside Rome and Paris respectively, but these convenient possibilities on the continent in the Napoleonic period were not available in the London of the 1820s, so Palmer encouraged long-term stays at his house in Shoreham or elsewhere in the village. Most members had commitments of work or family in London that meant their visits were of weeks if not days, and only William Palmer and Welby Sherman seem to have stayed longer.Vaughan, 19, 105‚Äì106 Blake himself made the trip at least once.Paley, 105 George Richmond self-portrait, 1830, gouache The artist John Linnell (1792‚Äî1882) was not a member of the group however he was close to most of the members. Palmer's reference to Linnell's young daughters as \\"little ancients\\" in a letter to him of September 1824 is a key piece of evidence as to the date the group was formed (Palmer later married one of them, Hannah).Vaughan, 18 Linnel was seven years older than Calvert, the oldest in the group, and a strong-minded person who disagreed with many of the group's positions. In a letter to Palmer years later he wrote that \\"I ought to remember that I was not one of the monthly- meeting elite‚Äî when at the Platonic feast of reason and soul only real Greeks from Hackney and Lisson Grove were admitted\\".Paley, 103 Linnell was probably mainly responsible for introducing Palmer and the others to northern European art of the 15th and 16th centuries, which was then relatively little-known in England. He knew Charles (Karl) Aders, a German businessman living in London who had an important collection of early Northern paintings, including a copy of the Ghent Altarpiece, which Linnell enabled the group to visit.Vaughan, 18‚Äì19, 101‚Äì102; Paley, 103‚Äì104. Aders' collection was sold in London in 1835; he and his wife were also friends with Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In 1832 Palmer received a further legacy, with which he bought a cottage in St John's Wood in London, and thereafter he gradually spent more time in London. The monthly dinners to which Linnell's letter refers were usually held there. Palmer and Richmond with their wives left together for an extended visit to Italy in 1837, which may be taken as the final end of the group, though most members continued as friends long afterwards.Paley, 108‚Äì112 The exposure in Italy to art in the classical tradition influenced both artists to move away from Ancient primitivism. The proximity of Shoreham to the Captain Swing campaign of insurgency among rural labourers in 1830, which Palmer violently opposed, may have disillusioned him as to the peace and harmony of rural life.Paley, 106‚Äì108 Richmond wrote in a letter to Palmer in later life \\"We all wanted thrashing when in a dream of sentiment we thought we were learning art\\".Paley, 118 == Membership == Edward Calvert, The Ploughman, wood engraving of 1827, 94 mm (3.7 in) by 140 mm (5.51 in) If there was ever any formal list of members, it has not survived, but the main figures, recruited roughly between 1824 and 1827, were:Vaughan, 105 ;Artists: * Edward Calvert (1799‚Äì1883); * Frederick Tatham (1805‚Äì1878); * Samuel Palmer (1805‚Äì1881); * George Richmond (1809‚Äì1896), the portrait painter; * Francis Oliver Finch (1802‚Äì1862); * Henry Walter (c. 1786 ‚Äì 1849); * Welby Sherman; ;Others: * John Giles, a stockbroker, cousin and \\"constant supporter\\" of Palmer.Vaughan, 105 * Arthur Tatham (1808‚Äì1874), for over forty years rector of Broadoak and Boconoc, Cornwall, and prebendary of Exeter Cathedral, brother of Frederick Tatham. ; Also associated: * Julia Tatham (1811‚Äì1881), Frederick Tatham's sister, who married George Richmond; ==NotesReferences== * * Vaughan, William, et al., Samuel Palmer, Vision and Landscape, 2005, British Museum Press, * Wilcox, Timothy.

Additional devices included the MS-01 Foot Controller, MS-02 Interface, MS-03 Signal Processor, and MS-04 Modulation Pedal. Although the MS-20 follows a conventional subtractive synthesis architecture of oscillators/filter/vca, its patch panel allows some rerouting of both audio and modulation, and it includes an external signal processor. This flexibility led to its resurgence during the analog revival of the late 1990s. In 2013, Korg responded to a revived interest in monophonic analog synthesizers by reintroducing the MS-20 in a reduced-sized form, as the MS-20 Mini. Apart from being 86% of the size of the original, the use of 1/8\\" jacks on the patch area, and the addition of MIDI capabilities, the MS-20 Mini is otherwise functionally identical to the original. ==ArchitectureAudio path=== Oscillators MS-20 knob section The MS-20 has two VCOs. The output of VCO1 can be set to triangle, sawtooth, adjustable-width pulse, or white noise. The output of VCO2 can be set to sawtooth, square pulse, narrow pulse, or \\"ring mod\\". (As with the ARP Odyssey, the \\"ring mod\\" is actually a logical exclusive-OR between the adjustable-width pulse wave output of VCO1 and the square pulse wave output of VCO2.) Although the pulse width of VCO1 is adjustable via a knob, there is no voltage control input for this parameter. As a result, automated pulse-width modulation is not possible, although modifications to the circuitry can add this functionality. The VCOs have Hz/V voltage control inputs but note that oct/V scaling is available via judicious use of the \\"total\\" CV input socket. Filters There are two VCFs in series. The first is a 6 dB/oct http://www.timstinchcombe.co.uk/synth/MS20_study.pdf high-pass, the second a 12 dB/oct low-pass. Resonance (\\"peak\\" in Korg parlance) is adjustable but not voltage-controlled. Originally, the filters used Korg's proprietary KORG-35 thick film IC. Later, the filters were redesigned to use off-the-shelf LM13600 OTAs. MS-20 units fitted with LM13600 filters have a small daughter board; the front panel on such units often has a tell-tale mounting screw whose head is visible in the vicinity of the VCA block diagram. However, a report to the Analogue Heaven email list in January 2010 identified an MS-20 with the front panel screw but containing the Korg 35 filter thick film circuit rather than the expected LM13600 circuit. A useful illustration of the Korg-35 filter in- circuit is shown here https://web.archive.org/web/20150619232549/http://www.punkdisco.co.uk/misc/gear/Korg/MS20/Disassemble1.jpg and some photographs illustrating the later LM13600 filter daughterboard are shown here . The tonal difference between the two is that the original Korg-35 filter has a slight amount of hiss which overdrives into the sound at high resonant settings. This causes the filter to have more of a \\"screaming\\" effect similar to it being used with a distortion pedal. The revised filter has most of this noise cleared up and is less aggressive sounding. Output The final component in the audio path is a VCA. It is a single-transistor design, based on a selected 2SC945 which is an NPN silicon device (equivalenced by 2N2222A according to the Towers' International Transistor Selector book, update 5 (, 90100)). ===Modulation=== MS-20 patch field Modulation generator The MS-20 has a low frequency oscillator, labelled \\"modulation generator\\". It has two controls (rate and shape) and two outputs (pulse and sloped). The shape control was a rather unusual feature for the time. It affects the duty cycle of the pulse output and the shape of the sloped output. When the control is at the anticlockwise end, the pulse width is very high (pulse output stays high for most of the cycle) and the sloped output is an upward sawtooth wave. At the clockwise end, the pulse width is very low (pulse output stays low for most of the cycle) and the sloped output is a downward sawtooth wave. At midway, the pulse width is 50% (pulse output is a square wave) and the sloped output is a triangle wave. The pulse output is available through the patch panel. It is unipolar (0 or +5V) and suitable for triggering the S&H; or the envelope generators. The sloped output is bipolar (-2.5V to +2.5V). Like the pulse output, it is available through a dedicated jack on the patch panel. It also feeds the top modulation bus and so can be used to modulate the frequency of the VCOs and the cutoff frequency of either or both VCF without patching. Envelopes There are two envelope generators. EG1 has Delay, Attack, and Release parameters, whilst EG2 has Hold, Attack, Decay, Sustain and Release. The envelope generators have S-trig trigger inputs. Other sources and options The MS-20 also includes a noise source (pink and white), a separate vactrol-based modulation VCA, a wheel controller, and a trigger button. It is possible to connect the MS-20 to a step sequencer like the SQ-10 (another product by Korg). This involves making use of the CV input and the trigger input which connects straight to the SQ-10, this means that the synthesizer and the step sequencer can work in synchronisation to play the notes when the next step of the sequencers pattern is triggered. In theory it is possible to connect any analogue sequencer to the MS-20 providing it has a trigger and CV output. ===External signal processor=== The MS-20 includes a frequency-voltage converter, envelope follower and gate extractor which can be used to drive it with an external signal. By connecting the output of the F-V converter to the CV input of the VCOs (VCO 1+2 CV IN) and the output of the gate extractor to the trigger input of the envelope generators (TRIG IN), the operator can play the MS-20 through his/her voice or another instrument. Instead of triggering the envelope generators, one can connect the output of the envelope follower to the main VCA's INITIAL GAIN input. In that mode of operation, the envelope generators are not used and the envelope of the MS-20's output is simply that of the external signal. == MS-20 reissues == The fully built MS-20 Kit ‚Äì the limited edition kit version of the MS-20 Mini. In January, 2013, Korg announced at NAMM that the company would release the Korg MS-20 mini. It is 86% the size of the Korg MS-20. The mini was designed by the engineers who developed the original MS-20. It aims to be a faithful re- release of the original electronic circuits of the MS-20. The MS-20 mini features 1/8-inch input and output jacks, a MIDI IN jack as well as USB MIDI (input and output). In January, 2014, Korg announced that they would release a limited edition full-size unassembled MS-20. Like the MS-20 Mini, this kit adds MIDI and USB connectivity. The MS-20 Kit also includes both MS-20 filter revisions, selectable by the user. In January, 2015, Korg announced at the 2015 NAMM show they would release an unassembled desktop module kit called the \\"MS-20M Kit.\\" The module kit does not include a keyboard and was sold as a bundle with the Korg SQ-1 step sequencer. This version features self- oscillating high-pass/low-pass filters with distinctive distortion, toggle switches for VCO 1 to 2 sync / VCO 1 to 2 FM, a toggle to switch between rev 1 and rev 2 filter designs, PWM IN jack allows pulse width modulation, supports all CV/GATE specifications: Hz/V and V/Oct, S-Trig and V-Trig, a MIDI IN connector and USB MIDI connector, and adds a junction patching bay for integration with SQ-1. In September of 2019, Behringer announced their low- cost clone of the MS-20, the K-2.https://www.musicradar.com/news/out-of- nowhere-behringer-announces-its-ms-20-clone-the-k-2 At NAMM 2020, Korg announced a full size reissue of the MS-20, the MS-20 FS. ==Software emulations== There is a software emulator of the MS-20 included in the KORG legacy Collection. As well as a standalone emulator, the Legacy Collection provides the MS-20 as a virtual instrument (VST). The external signal processor is implemented separately as a VST effect called MS-20EX. This same software emulated MS-20 was also part of the LAC-1 expansion for the Korg OASYS and is one of the Korg Kronos sound engines. KORG DS-10 is a music creation program for the Nintendo DS that emulates the Korg MS range of synthesizers. KORG iMS-20 is an MS-20 emulator for the iPad. ==Notable users== * Add N to (X) * Air * Alec Empire * Alphaville * Aphex Twin * Apoptygma Berzerk * Arcade Fire * Asian Dub Foundation * Astral Projection * Atoms for Peace * Autechre * √Åkos Nagy * BBC Radiophonic Workshop * Beborn Beton * Broadcast (band) * Chicks on Speed * Chrislo HaasRudi Esch, Electri_City: The D√ºsseldorf School of Electronic Music, page 257, Omnibus Press * Chvrches * Cluster ensemble * Coil * Ian J.

The prairie was named after its rich, dark soil. ==Setting== The Texas Blackland Prairies ecoregion covers an area of , consisting of a main belt of and two islands of tallgrass prairie grasslands southeast of the main Blackland Prairie belt; both the main belt and the islands extend northeast/southwest. The main belt consists of oaklands and savannas and runs from just south of the Red River on the Texas-Oklahoma border through the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metropolitan area and into southwestern Texas. The central forest-grasslands transition lies to the north and northwest, and the Edwards Plateau savanna and the Tamaulipan mezquital to the southwest. The larger of the two islands is the Fayette Prairie, encompassing , and the smaller is the San Antonio Prairie with an area of . The two islands are separated from the main belt by the oak woodlands of the East Central Texas forests, which surround the islands on all sides but the northeast, where the Fayette Prairie meets the East Texas Piney Woods. ==Formation== This area was shaped by frequent wildfires and visits by plains bison. Large fires ignited by lightning frequently swept the area, clearing shrubs and stimulating forbs and grasses. Large herds of bison also grazed on the grasses, and they trampled and fertilized the soil, stimulating the growth of the tallgrass ecosystem. Hunter-gatherers contributed to the formation and expansion of the prairie through controlled burns to make more land suitable for hunting bison and other game. Hunter-gatherers continually inhabited the prairie since pre- Clovis times over 15,000 years ago. In historic times, they included the Wichita, Waco, Tonkawa, and Comanche, each of whom were gradually replaced by settled agrarian society. The advent of large-scale irrigated farming and ranching in the area ended the expansionary period in the prairie's formation and quickly led to widespread habitat loss. ==Conservation== Because of the soil and climate, this ecoregion is ideally suited to crop agriculture. This has led to most of the Blackland Prairie ecosystem being converted to crop production, leaving less than one percent remaining (and some groups estimate less than 0.5% to less than 0.1% remaining) and making the tallgrass the most- endangered large ecosystem in North America. Small remnants are conserved at sites such as The Nature Conservancy's 800-acre Clymer Meadow Preserve near Celeste, TX. ==Ecology== Important prairie plants included little bluestem, yellow indiangrass, big bluestem, tall dropseed, and a variety of wildflowers including gayfeathers, asters, Maximilian sunflower, wild indigos and compass plant. The fauna of the Blackland Prairies includes foxes, frogs, lizards, rattlesnakes, opossums, coyotes, white-tailed deer, and striped skunks. The prairie was formerly home to animals such as American bison, wolves, and jaguars before overhunting and the destruction of most tallgrass ecosystems. The soil of the Blackland Prairies, from which the \\"blackland\\" get its name, contains black or deep dark-gray, alkaline clay which is further blackened by char from wildfires and controlled burns. \\"Black gumbo\\" and \\"black velvet\\" are local names for this soil. In dry weather, deep cracks form in the clay, which can cause serious damage to buildings and infrastructure. Soil management problems also include water erosion, cotton root rot, soil tilth, and brush control. == Texas blackland prairies gallery == File:Ranchland in the Blackland Prairie eco-region of Texas with Texas bluebonnets (Lupinus texensis), Washington County, Texas, USA (30 March 2012).jpgRanchland in the Blackland Prairie eco-region of Texas with Texas bluebonnets (Lupinus texensis), Washington County, Texas, USA (30 March 2012).

Her concept of privacy by design, which takes privacy into account throughout the system engineering process, was expanded on, as part of a joint Canadian-Dutch team, both before and during her tenure as commissioner (1997 to 2014). She was hired by Ryerson University as a distinguished visiting professor after the end of her three terms as IPC. Cavoukian was appointed Executive Director of the Ryerson's Privacy and Big Data Institute in 2014. Since 2017, Cavoukian has been the Distinguished Expert-in-Residence of the university's Privacy by Design Centre of Excellence. ==Early life and career== Cavoukian was born in Cairo, Egypt in 1952 to ethnic Armenian parents Artin and Lucie Cavoukian, and immigrated to Toronto with her family in 1958. She is the sister of Canadian children's entertainer Raffi and photographer Cavouk Cavoukian. She holds a B.A. from York University and received an MA and Ph.D in psychology from the University of Toronto, where she specialized in criminology and law. In the 1980s, she headed the Research Services Branch for the provincial Attorney General.Commissioner by Design: Former Commissioner, Dr. Ann Cavoukian ‚Äì Ontario's longest serving Information and Privacy Commissioner, Privacy and Big Data Institute She joined the Ontario provincial Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner in 1987. Cavoukian served as its first Director of Compliance followed by her appointment as Assistant Commissioner in 1990. ==Tenure as Privacy Commissioner== She was initially appointed Commissioner in 1997, and is the first Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario to have been re-appointed for a third term. Serving as an officer of the provincial legislature, the Commissioner is independent of the government of the day. ===Adoption disclosure=== On March 29, 2005, Commissioner Cavoukian spoke out against the adoption disclosure Bill 183, Adoption Information Disclosure Act, stating that the proposed law needed an amendment giving birth parents and adoptees from adoptions that occurred prior to the passing of this retroactive law the right, if desired, to file a disclosure veto to prevent the opening of their sealed files. The Adoption Information Disclosure Act received Royal Assent on November 3, 2005, without Commissioner Cavoukian's proposed disclosure veto. On September 19, 2007, Justice Belobaba, of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled the Adoption Information Disclosure Act as unconstitutional ‚Äì it breached section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and thus, the sections of the Act relating to access to birth registration information are invalid. On November 14, 2007, the government of Ontario introduced new adoption legislation that includes both a disclosure veto for adoptees and birth parents in adoptions that have already taken place and also promotes openness for adoptions where a disclosure veto is not registered and for all future adoptions. The Access to Adoption Records Act includes both a disclosure veto for adoptees and birth parents in adoptions that have already taken place. ===Personal Health Information Protection Act=== On November 1, 2004, Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) took effect granting the province of Ontario its first health information privacy legislation where it will govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal health information. Cavoukian had been an advocate of this legislation since the IPC was first formed in 1987. The IPC is the oversight agency for the new law. As of November 1, 2004 patients who are denied access to their own personal health records, or who believe that their personal health information was collected, used or disclosed contrary to the new legislation, can complain to the IPC. During her tenure, Cavoukian issued eleven Health Orders under PHIPA. ===Privacy by Design=== Cavoukian created the concept of Privacy by Design. In 2010 the annual assembly of International Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners unanimously passed a resolution recognizing privacy by design as an essential component of fundamental privacy protection and it is a core part of the European Union GDPR regulations. ===Toronto Transit Commission surveillance cameras=== In November 2007, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) announced plans to expand its video surveillance program which resulted in a formal complaint to Commissioner Cavoukian from Privacy International, a U.K.-based organization, citing concerns that the TTC's proposed expansion was a violation of privacy laws. In response to this complaint, Cavoukian launched an investigation where she ruled that the TTC's expansion of its video surveillance system did not contravene any applicable privacy laws. As part of her investigation, she made 13 recommendations to the TTC, which have all been implemented, and she also encouraged the TTC to conduct a pilot project to test the use of a privacy- enhancing video surveillance technology, developed by researchers at the University of Toronto. == Recent Activity == Cavoukian was awarded an honorary LL.D by the University of Guelph at the Fall 2014 convocation. She was hired by Ryerson University as a distinguished visiting professor after the end of her three terms as IPC. Cavoukian was appointed Executive Director of the Ryerson's Privacy and Big Data Institute in 2014. Since 2017, Cavoukian has been the Distinguished Expert-in-Residence of the university's Privacy by Design Centre of Excellence. ===Resignation from Sidewalk Labs- WATERFRONToronto Project=== In 2017, Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. (parent company of Google LLC), partnered with Waterfront Toronto to begin developing a smart city area in the 12 acre sector called Quayside. The project was heralded as a premier example that \\"would develop a whole new district of Toronto as a working model of a new type of smart city\\". Sidewalk Labs touted the Quayside Project as \\"an experimental urban neighbourhood 'from the internet up'\\". The project was occurring within the larger context of the Smart Cities Challenge, a competition for $80 million in Canadian government funding, although it was not seeking funding under the competition. The proposed Sidewalk Labs development raised concerns around the breadth and depth of information collected under the project's umbrella. \\"Quayside may be one of the most sensor-laden neighbourhoods [proposed] in North America...It's being imagined as the sort of place where garbage cans and recycling bins can keep track of when and how often they're used, environmental probes can measure noise and pollution over time and cameras can collect data to model and improve the flow of cars, people, buses and bikes throughout the day\\". It was noted that \\"Access to those systems and the use of that data, in this private-public partnership, will raise novel policy questions for governments about privacy and governance.‚Äù As the project was seen as a potential standard-setting benchmark in the development of smart cities worldwide, researchers raised concerns about the value of the data collected by Alphabet in the course of the project and how that value might be negotiated with the City of Toronto- as well as the ways that data would be collected and managed. These issues were acknowledged by Waterfront Toronto's Board of Directors in March 2018: \\"Privacy, data governance, cyber security and the ethical use of technology are complex questions which need to be addressed in a robust way to ensure that the Sidewalk Toronto initiative progresses in a way that encourages innovation while preserving the public good\\".WaterfronToronto. (2018, March 29). Board of Directors Meeting. WaterfronToronto, The Board of Directors committed to \\"ensuring that the corporation has a robust team of independent advisors to ensure the protection of individual privacy rights for those who live,learn, work and visit within the new neighborhood\\". As part of that commitment, Ann Cavoukian was retained by Sidewalks Lab \\"to advise them on their privacy framework, and they have made a commitment to approaching all of their solutions with Privacy by Design at their foundation\\". By October 2018, Cavoukian resigned from the Sidewalk Labs citing concerns that the project was not consistent with her widely respected \\"Privacy by Design\\" principles. While initially assured by Sidewalk Labs that they would de- identify all collected data at the source, Cavoukian was told at an October 15, 2018 meeting that Sidewalk Labs could not force the additional third parties involved in the data collection to similarly commit to de-identify data collected at the source. The de-identification of data at source significant according to Cavoukian because \\"the smart city will likely be filled with sensors and other devices that will collect information 24/7, but their pervasiveness will make it to difficult to get consent from every person whose data is being collected\\". Cavoukian stated, ‚ÄúWhen I heard that, I said, 'I‚Äôm sorry. I can‚Äôt support this. I have to resign because you committed to embedding privacy by design into every aspect of your operation'.‚Äù Her letter of resignation stated \\"I imagined us creating a smart city of privacy, as opposed to a smart city of surveillance\\". Cavoukian met with Waterfront Toronto on November 5, 2018 to call for the immediate de-identification of data at the source and to express her willingness to continue working with the organization. Cavoukian stated, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want people worrying about where they‚Äôre coming and going. We certainly don‚Äôt want a city of surveillance. That‚Äôs not on.‚Äù ===2019 ITAC Smart Cities Technology Summit=== Cavoukian participated in a panel discussion at the 2019 ITAC Smart Cities Technology Summit in Brampton, Ontario. At one point, she said: ==Works== Cavoukian published two books on privacy with co-authors: *Tyler Hamilton: The Privacy Payoff: How Successful Businesses Build Customer Trust, 2002. *Don Tapscott: Who Knows: Safeguarding Your Privacy in a Networked World, 1997. ==Awards== *2014 ‚Äì Top 50 Power List (Maclean's Magazine)http://www.macleans.ca/general/the-macleans-2014-power-list- part-1/#pow36 *2014 ‚Äì Power 50 (Canadian Business Magazine)http://www.canadianbusiness.com/lists-and-rankings/most-powerful- people/power-50-2014-introduction/ *2014 ‚Äì Award of Distinction (Corporate Knights) *2014 ‚Äì KuppingerCole Lifetime Achievement Award (European Identity & Cloud Conference) *2011 ‚Äì Top 25 Women of Influence (Women of Influence Inc.) *2011 ‚Äì Information Access and Protection of Privacy Award (University of Alberta) *2011 ‚Äì Privacy Professional of the Year (SC Congress) *2011 ‚Äì Kristian Beckman Award (IFIP) *2008 ‚Äì Privacy Hero and Leadership Award (WiredSafety) *2007 ‚Äì Top 100 most powerful women in Canada (Women's Executive Network) *2007 ‚Äì Dr. Barbara Wand Award (Ontario Psychological Association) *2006 ‚Äì Outstanding contribution to the protection of privacy rights in Ontario (Ontario Bar Association) *2006 ‚Äì IABC All-Star speaker (International Association of Business Communicators) *2005 ‚Äì Privacy Innovation Award (International Association of Privacy Professionals) *2003 ‚Äì Privacy Manager of the Year (Privacy Manager Magazine) ==Memberships and affiliations== *Chair, IPSI Advisory Board *International Biometric Advisory Council *IBM Privacy Management Council *Judge, FairWarning Privacy Excellence Awards *European Association for Biometrics Advisory Board (EABAC) *Future of Privacy Forum *RIM Council *Distinguished Fellow of the Ponemon Institute *Women of Influence ==References * Profile at Privacy and Big Data Institute Category:Ontario civil servants Category:Privacy in Canada Category:People from Toronto Category:University of Toronto alumni Category:York University alumni Category:Canadian people of Armenian descent Category:Egyptian Armenians Category:Egyptian emigrants to Canada Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Ryerson University people Category:People from Cairo ","title":"Ann Cavoukian"},{"id":"2221755","text":" Soleil Royal (Royal Sun) was a French 104-gun ship of the line, flagship of Admiral Tourville. She was built in Brest between 1668 and 1670 by engineer Laurent Hubac, was launched in 1669, and stayed unused in Brest harbour for years. She was recommissioned with 112 guns and 1200 men when the Nine Years' War broke out in 1688 as the flagship of the escadre du Ponant (squadron of the West). She was said to be a good sailing ship and her decorations were amongst the most beautiful and elaborate of all baroque flagships. The emblem of the \\"sun\\" had been chosen by Louis XIV as his personal symbol. == Career  Battle of Beachy Head=== Soleil Royal was recommissioned with 112 guns and 1200 men when the Nine Years' War broke out. She departed Brest on 22 June 1690 as flagship of Anne Hilarion de Tourville. She spent three days in Camaret-sur-Mer waiting for favourable wind before sailing to Isle of Wight where the English fleet was thought to be anchored. Two ships sent in reconnaissance located the English anchored at Beachy Head. The Battle of Beachy Head (known in French as \\"Bataille de B√©veziers\\") began in the morning of the 10 July 1690 when the French surprised the English ships anchored. Soleil Royal led the centre of the French formation. === Battle of Barfleur === In 1692, on the 12th of May, now carrying 104 guns, she left Brest, leading a 45-vessel fleet; on the 29th, the squadron met a 97-ship strong English and Dutch fleet in the Battle of Barfleur. In spite of their numerical inferiority, the French attacked but were forced to flee after a large-scale battle resulting in heavy damage to both sides. The Soleil Royal was too severely damaged to return to Brest, and was beached in Cherbourg for repairs, along with the Admirable and Triomphant. === Battle at Cherbourg and the end of the Soleil Royal === During the night of the 2nd and 3 June, beached at the Pointe du Hommet, she was attacked by 17 ships, which she managed to repel with artillery fire. However, a fireship set her stern on fire and the fire soon reached the powder rooms. Although the population of Cherbourg came to rescue, there was only one survivor among the 883 (or even 950)-strong crew. The remains of the Soleil Royal now lie buried beneath a parking space next to the Arsenal. == Legacy == Soleil Royal became a traditional name for capital ships of the Ancien R√©gime, and several ships bore it afterwards. A detailed 1/40th scale model of the hull and sculptures was built in 1839 by sculptor and modelist Jean-Baptiste Tanneron.

He worked as a farmer, and served as a school trustee and municipal assessor. In 1906, Muirhead married Lucy E. Dunfield. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1922 provincial election as a candidate of the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM), defeating Conservative incumbent Reuben Waugh by 137 votes in the Norfolk constituency. The UFM unexpectedly won a majority of seats in this election, and formed government as the Progressive Party. Muirhead served as a backbench supporter of John Bracken's government throughout his time in the legislature. He was returned in the 1927 election, defeating Waugh by thirty-four votes in a rematch from the 1922 contest. He defeated Waugh a third time in the 1932 election, by 236 votes.

It is common in central and southern Europe, migrating northwards every summer, often reaching southern Scandinavia and sometimes southern England. ==Description== * The Bath white is a small white butterfly with a wingspan of 45 to 50 mm. The underside of the hindwing has a pattern of greenish blotches, which is characteristic of the Bath whites and easily identifies it from other pierids. * Sexes can be differentiated by markings on the forewing. The male is differentiated from the female by the markings on the upperside of the forewing. The apex of the forewing is black with white spots and lines. There is a black spot at the end of the cell. In the case of the female, there is an additional discal spot in 1b. The female also has an obscure row of terminal and marginal spots on the upper hindwing. John Curtis's British Entomology Volume 5 :*Description from C. T. Bingham in The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma, \\"Butterflies Volume 2\\" (1907). :::* Male: Upperside: white. Forewing: basal half of costa narrowly irrorated with black scales, a broad irregular quadrate black spot over the discocellulars; apex and termen anteriorly, above vein 3 broadly black, with a subterminal series of spots of the ground colour, prolonged as fine lines to the terminal margin. Hindwing: uniform, the markings on the underside showing faintly through; a costal spot before the apex, and in some specimens, some obscure, anterior terminal markings indicated by irrorated black scaling. Underside: white. Forewing: the form of the markings as on the upperside but the base of the cell with an irroration of green scales, the black discocellular spot extended to the costa, often washed with green or with a green centre to the black; the apical patch green not black, with the spots of the ground colour on it ill- defined and obscure; a black or greenish-black spot in the outer half of interspace 1. Hindwing: green; costal margin at base yellow; dorsal margin white; a spot in middle of cell, another above it in interspace 7, a curved irregular discal series of conjoined spots beyond the cell, of which the upper two spots in interspaces 1 to 6, white; the veins sometimes faintly yellow. Antennae dusky-black; head, thorax and abdomen fuscous black; beneath; head, thorax and abdomen white. :::* Female: Upperside: differs as follows: Forewing: a dusky-black streak extends from the base along costa and terminates at the black spot on the discocellulars; a transverse, somewhat quadrate black spot in the outer half of interspace 1, with sometimes a short ill-defined black streak below it; the black area on apex and anterior portion of termen broader, the white spots on it blurred and obscure. Hindwing: a large costal black spot before apex; a broad, black, subterminal, inwardly diffuse, curved band in continuation of the same, and a terminal series of clavate black marks that start from the outer margin of the black subterminal band. Underside: markings much as in the male but broader. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the male. :::* Wingspan: 52‚Äì56 mm ==Distribution and habitat== This butterfly is common in central and southern Europe, Asia Minor, Persia and Afghanistan, migrating northwards in the summer. In Central Asia, the Bath white ranges from Baluchistan, Peshawar, Chitral, Kashmir and along the Himalayas right across the Central Himalayas up to Darjeeling. The butterfly appears to be extending its range westwards along the Himalayas.

Westwood and Sarah Jane Gregory, and was educated at Rapid City and Brandon Baptist College. He worked as a notary public and municipal clerk, and served as secretary of the Roblin Pool Elevator Association. He worked with the Union Bank of Canada in Roblin from December 1906 to November 1917. In 1912, Westwood married Carrie Marie Hartford. From 1920 to 1946, he was secretary-treasurer for the Rural Municipality of Shell River. Westwood was mayor of Roblin from 1944 to 1946. In 1945, he moved to Russell, where he purchased a hardware store which he operated with his sons until 1960. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in a by-election held in the Roblin constituency on November 19, 1917. He served as an independent member of the legislature, and did not seek re-election in the provincial election of 1920.

He still identified himself as an independent, but was now supported by the governing Liberal-Progressive alliance led by John Bracken. He defeated Conservative incumbent Frederic Y. Newton by 609 votes, and served as a pro-government independent. He was defeated in the 1936 election, losing to S. E. Rogers of the newly formed Social Credit League. He died in Russell at the age of 74. Westwood's son, Fred Westwood, was a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada in the 1965 federal election. == References == Category:1887 births Category:1962 deaths Category:Independent MLAs in Manitoba Category:Mayors of places in Manitoba Category:People from Roblin, Manitoba ","title":"William James Westwood"},{"id":"2221802","text":"The Orange County Fair, abbreviated as the OC Fair, is a 23-day annual fair that is held every summer at the OC Fair & Event Center in Costa Mesa, California. The 2021 OC Fair is from July 16 to August 15. ==History== The fair first took place in the year 1890 and consisted of some minor exhibits in Santa Ana and a horse race. From 1889 to 1894 the fair was run by the Orange County Community Fair Corporation, but was then taken over by the Orange County Fair Association, Inc. Early fairs mainly consisted of horse races and livestock shows, but around 1900 new carnival-like attractions were added and the fair become a yearly occurrence. The fair was located in Santa Ana, except for a brief interval after World War I, when it was moved to Huntington Beach. Costa Mesa Skyline Starting in 1916, the fair was managed by the Orange County Farm Bureau. An Orange County Fair Board was elected in 1925, and the fair was moved to Anaheim with the addition of a rodeo and carnival. From 1932 to 1939, the fair was located in Pomona, California as part of a combined Orange, Los Angeles, and Riverside County Fair. Following World War II the 32nd District Agricultural Association was formed by the state of California, and it took on the task of running the fair. The state purchased land from the Santa Ana Army Air Base and set some of it aside for use as a new fairgrounds. In 1949 the fair became a five-day-long event and was relocated to the old army base, which quickly became the permanent location. The city of Costa Mesa was incorporated in 1953 with the fair residing in its boundaries. The fairgrounds' 150 acres has been the home of the fair ever since 1949 and has expanded to an annual 23 day summer event. On April 27, 2020 for the first time since 1945, the 2020 fair was cancelled in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; come 2021, hand sanitisers will be installed within the premises, to prevent this and other diseases from spreading. ==Fairground sale== In May 2009, then Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger recommended the Orange County Fairgrounds be listed for sale. He had decided the fairgrounds were \\"surplus or underutilized\\" assets, although the Fair hosts more than one million visitors each year and is utilized virtually every day of the week with multiple community activities. OC Weekly reported, \\"What followed was a story of deception by a small group in a position of power within the fairgrounds hierarchy. Through various contractual agreements between people of wealth and power, a move was made to privatize that public land in what members of the Orange County Fairgrounds Preservation Society call one of the largest, most deliberate land grabs in the county's long history of land grabs.\\" The Preservation Society quickly stepped in to halt the sale. They contended that the OC legislators in Sacramento had been remiss in intervening to stop the transaction, that the proposed deal to sell public land was both \\"Ill-advised and illegal.\\" Both the Del Mar Fairgrounds and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum were saved by just such an intervention by the legislators. A public auction was held, but before any sales agreements could be signed, there were two lawsuits filed and the sale was stopped. The Preservation Society, and Tel Phil Enterprises filed in the Court of Appeal and asked that the new governor Jerry Brown have the sale categorically dismissed. Lawsuits by two former building commissioners that Schwarzenegger had fired, however, stalled the proposed sale long enough for incoming Governor Brown to have the final word. ===OCFEC Board of Directors response=== After a closed session on January 27, 2011, the OCFEC Board of Directors issued the following policy statement regarding the sale of the fairgrounds: On February 8, 2011, the 32nd District Agricultural Association sent a letter to Governor Jerry Brown, which can be viewed as a PDF at the site.http://www.ocfair.com/ocf/020811LettertotheGovernor.pdf ===Gubernatorial response=== In February 2011, California Governor Jerry Brown told the Los Angeles Times, \\"This is not the best time to be selling real estate. I think we have time to consider what we ought to do with that.\\" He also said that his predecessor's plan, rather than helping California's budget crisis, would \\"have cost taxpayers far more in the long run.\\" Assemblyman Jose Solorio (D-Santa Ana) stated that Brown's comments were \\"a good sign.\\" ==Attendance== The Orange County Fair is the 9th-largest fair in the United States. {  - !Year  Attendance -  2020  0 -  2019  1,393,482 -  2018  1,470,636 -  2017  1,334,000 -  2016  1,344,996 -  2015  1,301,445 -  2014  1,337,167 -  2012  1,300,000 -  2011  1,400,280 -  2010  1,135,536 -  2009  1,070,061 -  2008  1,062,673 -  2007  1,090,653 -  2006  924,315 -  2005  1,058,192 -  2004  963,984 -  2003  881,596 -  2002  898,197 -  2001  843,347 -  2000  808,810 -  1999  724,561 -  1998  723,061 -  1997  785,944 } ==Climate== The Fairground in Costa Mesa has a Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Csb), that is nearly perfect for its many outdoor activities. ==Gallery== File:OC Fair swings.jpgSwings File:OC Fair gravitron.jpgStarship 2000 File:OC Fair zipper.jpgThe Zipper ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * Category:Orange County, California culture Category:Annual fairs Category:Fairs in California Category:Costa Mesa, California Category:Tourist attractions in Orange County, California Category:Recurring events established in 1890 Category:1890 establishments in California ","title":"Orange County Fair (California)"},{"id":"2221816","text":"Chromatics is an American electronic music band from Portland, Oregon, formed in 2001. The band consists of Ruth Radelet (vocals, guitar, synthesizer), Adam Miller (guitar, vocoder), Nat Walker (drums, synthesizer), and Johnny Jewel (producer, multi-instrumentalist). The band originally featured a trademark sound indebted to punk and lo-fi that was described as \\"noisy\\" and \\"chaotic\\". After numerous lineup changes, which left guitarist Adam Miller as the sole original member, the band began releasing material on the Italians Do It Better record label in 2007, with their style streamlined into an Italo disco- influenced sound. Their third album Night Drive (2007) was met with critical acclaim, as was their fourth album, Kill for Love, which was released on March 26, 2012. Several of the band's songs have been featured in television series such as Bates Motel, Gossip Girl, Mr. Robot, Parenthood, Revenge, Riverdale, 13 Reasons Why, and Twin Peaks, as well as being featured in the films Drive (2011), Taken 2 (2012), and The Perfection (2019). In December 2014, the band announced what would have been their fifth studio album, titled Dear Tommy. While Chromatics have released a number of singles from it, Dear Tommy had yet to be released when they instead issued the album Closer to Grey in October 2019. ==History2001: A solo project on a 4-track=== Chromatics' first 7-inch, \\"Beach of Infants/Steps\\", was a solo project of Adam Miller. It was released by Hand Held Heart. Miller has been Chromatics' sole consistent member. \\"Beach of Infants/Steps\\" was recorded in Seattle, Washington, on a Tascam 4-track. By the time the 7-inch was released, Chromatics had scaled up to a four-piece. ===2002‚Äì2003: Early lineup=== Miller also played in The Vogue, a group that garnered media attention around Seattle. The Vogue were barely out of high school and created art punk that drew comparisons to The Fall. This band featured Johnny Whitney of The Blood Brothers on vocals and Hannah Blilie who went on to play drums in The Gossip. After The Vogue's keyboardist departed, the remaining members formed Soiled Doves, and released one 7-inch and one album. Although Chromatics began as a solo project for Adam Miller, he quickly added most of The Soiled Doves' lineup. Adam Miller became the vocalist. Devin Welch played guitar. Michelle Nolan, a new addition, played bass guitar Blilie played drums. After releasing their debut album Chrome Rats vs. Basement Rutz in 2003 on Gold Standard Laboratories, all members except Miller left to form Shoplifting. ===2003‚Äì2005: Stripped down=== Miller and a revamped lineup released the band's second studio album, Plaster Hounds, in 2004 on Gold Standard Laboratories. This lineup featured Adam Miller performing double duty on guitar and vocals, with Nat Sahlstrom on bass and the Get Hustle's Ron Avila on percussion. The lineup changed once again, as Miller played many of the same songs from the Plaster Hounds era with Lena Okazaki replacing Sahlstrom on bass and a drum machine replacing the free jazz-influenced percussive style of Avila. This lineup of Miller and Okazaki released a few CD-Rs, still in the lo-fi art punk style that had been established, but the addition of the drum machine hinted at the major stylistic shift to come. While Miller's CD-Rs with Okazaki hinted at an electronic direction, Okazaki left the band and Chromatics went through their largest reinvention around 2005, becoming the quartet of Miller, Ruth Radelet, Johnny Jewel, and Nat Walker. This resulted in a gradual but dramatic shift in the band's sound and live performance. Chromatics have often toured the world with labelmates Glass Candy, since Jewel plays in both bands, as well as Desire, a side project of Jewel and Walker. Walker and Jewel also have an instrumental project called Symmetry. ===2006‚Äì2010: Night Drive=== Chromatics' third studio album, Night Drive, was released in 2007 on Italians Do It Better, the band's most acclaimed release. On Night Drive, the group ditched their \\"hairy noise-rock troupe\\" aesthetic in favor of a \\"neatly groomed pop- dance quartet\\". In their review of the album, Pitchfork noted that \\"the transformation of Chromatics has been so effortless that it's still easy to be wowed by the results\\", adding that \\"listeners who are only familiar with the band's forays into shambling punk will certainly be surprised by Night Drives assured songwriting\\". Various songs from Night Drive have been licensed for usage in multiple Hollywood films, television shows, international television and internet advertisements, and runway shows. Other releases have included the Nite and In Shining Violence EPs. In 2007, Chromatics' non-album tracks \\"In the City\\" and \\"Hands in the Dark\\", as well as a demo of Night Drives \\"The Killing Spree\\", were featured on the Italians Do It Better compilation album After Dark. ===2011‚Äì2013: Kill for Love=== Chromatics performing at La Route du Rock festival in 2012 Chromatics gained recognition for their song \\"Tick of the Clock\\" which was used in the film Drive, released in September 2011 by director Nicolas Winding Refn, and its soundtrack,Gosling Noir ‚Äì A Review of the Drive Soundtrack and again in the film Taken 2, released in October 2012 by director Olivier Megaton, and its soundtrack. On December 23, 2011, Jewel and Walker‚Äîunder the name Symmetry‚Äîreleased Themes for an Imaginary Film, which was described by Pitchfork as Jewel's \\"most ambitious project to date: a sprawling, 37-track, two-hour collection of cinematic noir-electro\\", featuring contributions from Chromatics and fellow Italians Do It Better acts Glass Candy, Desire and Mirage. On October 23, 2011, Chromatics released the title track from their then-upcoming fourth studio album, Kill for Love. Reviews described the single as a \\"really hypnotizing, fascinating song that will definitely get you psyched for the record‚ÄîRuth Radalet warmly croons her sweet, cryptic confessional lyrics while her band effortlessly weaves a bubbling, dreamy, New Order-esque soundscape.\\" The Fader mentioned, \\"Maybe Kill for Love will inaugurate a sea change where artists come to terms with themselves and start being open about how they sound when they sing. In basement studios everywhere, young vocalists will blink three times and start x-ing out effects in Ableton, look at the mirror for the first time in weeks, deep into their beady, sun-deprived eyes and whisper, \\"God, there are no shortcuts... Kill for Love continues the band's penchant for popular-sound defiance that made Chromatics so exciting in the first place.\\" After waiting patiently, Chromatics have begun to reach fans \\"five years after the release of their incredibly prescient Night Drive album.\\" \\"Kill for Love\\" was featured in the television shows Bates Motel and Gossip Girl. On February 11, 2012, the band leaked a second track from Kill for Love, \\"Into the Black\\", a cover of the Neil Young song \\"Out of the Blue and Into the Black\\", which was featured in the television shows Mr. Robot, Revenge, Riverdale, 13 Reasons Why, and The 100. Chromatics followed their second leak with three additional tracks, \\"Lady\\", \\"Candy\\" and on March 11, 2012 their fifth leak \\"Back from the Grave\\". As fans anticipated the album, Jewel mentioned that the process of creating Kill for Love resulted in a total of 36 tracks that have been narrowed down to 17 for the album. Chromatics' fourth studio album, Kill for Love, was released on March 26, 2012. The album has been described as sounding like a \\"time warp ... a warm collision of past, present, and future.\\" On May 7, 2012, the group released an alternative version of Kill for Love for free download, featuring eleven songs from the original album with no drums or percussion. Songs from the album have been featured in television shows such as Bates Motel, Gossip Girl, Mr. Robot, Parenthood, Revenge, Riverdale, and 13 Reasons Why. Kill for Love was named the eighth best album of 2012 by Pitchfork. Chromatics were invited by Karl Lagerfeld to play the Chanel Spring Summer 2013 fashion show in Paris in early October. The band was put above the runway, overlooking the whole catwalk and creating a dreamy ambience. Chromatics performed about five new and old songs. ===2014‚Äìpresent: Dear Tommy and Closer to Grey=== On December 4, 2014, the band announced their fifth studio album, Dear Tommy. The album was preceded by the singles \\"Just Like You\\", \\"I Can Never Be Myself When You're Around\\", and \\"In Films\\". On February 3, 2015, Chromatics released the three-track single \\"Yes (Love Theme from Lost River)\\", which is included in both the trailer and soundtrack for Ryan Gosling's directorial debut, Lost River, and featured in the television show Riverdale. The soundtrack was released on March 30 by Italians Do It Better, while the film was released on April 10. The song \\"Shadow\\" was made available on September 9. On November 5, Chromatics released seven cover versions of Cyndi Lauper's \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\\", one which was featured in an ad for Mango featuring Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne, and another that is featured in the trailer for the 2019 Netflix original series Baby. The band released a music video for the title track \\"Dear Tommy\\" on August 25, 2016. In May 2017, Chromatics' former manager revealed on Twitter that Jewel had destroyed all copies of the finished Dear Tommy following a near-death experience in late 2015, but had subsequently re- recorded the entire album. As of August 2019, the album has not been released. The band performed \\"Shadow\\" at the end of the two-hour-long season premiere of Showtime's Twin Peaks revival series, which aired on May 21, 2017. The band released a deluxe version of the Cherry EP on July 31, 2017. On October 1, 2019, the Italians Do It Better website was updated to show a new Chromatics album, albeit with the album and track names obscured. Upon the album's release in New Zealand, the album title was revealed to be Closer to Grey, and the album title and track names were officially announced worldwide. The album was released on October 2, 2019. The band stated through their Instagram account that Closer to Grey did not contain any material from Dear Tommy, and that the latter album would still be released, with no release date announced. On January 24, 2020, Chromatics released a new single, \\"TOY.\\" On March 6, they released another single, \\"Famous Monsters.\\" On April 16 they released \\"Teacher\\" and a new tracklisting for Dear Tommy. ==Tours== Chromatics have played at numerous music festivals around the world, such as the Paris Pitchfork Music Festival and Barcelona Primavera in 2012. In September 2013, the band opened for English band The xx at the Hollywood Bowl. ==Members== * Ruth Radelet ‚Äì vocals, guitar, synthesizer * Adam Miller ‚Äì guitar, vocoder * Nat Walker ‚Äì drums, synthesizer * Johnny Jewel ‚Äì programming, production, synthesizer, guitar, drums, mixing, engineering ==DiscographyStudio albums=== * Chrome Rats vs. Basement Rutz (Gold Standard Laboratories, 2003) * Plaster Hounds (Gold Standard Laboratories, 2004) * Night Drive (Italians Do It Better, 2007) * Kill for Love (Italians Do It Better, 2012) * Closer to Grey (Italians Do It Better, 2019) Unreleased * Dear Tommy ===Mixtapes=== * Running from the Sun (Italians Do It Better, 2012) ===Extended plays=== * Cavecare (Hand Held Heart, 2002) * Nite (Italians Do It Better, 2005) * In the City (Italians Do It Better, 2010) * Lady (Italians Do It Better, 2012) * Cherry (Italians Do It Better, 2014) * Just Like You (Italians Do It Better, 2015) * Camera (Italians Do It Better, 2018) ===Singles=== * \\"Beach of Infants\\"/\\"Steps\\" (Hand Held Heart, 2001) * \\"Arms Slither Away\\"/\\"Skill Fall\\" (K, 2002) * \\"Ice Hatchets\\"/\\"Curtains\\" (Gold Standard Laboratories, 2003) * \\"Healer\\"/\\"Witness\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2005) * \\"Tick of the Clock\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2013) * \\"Cherry\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2013) * \\"These Streets Will Never Look the Same\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2013) * \\"Yes (Love Theme from Lost River)\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2015) * \\"Just Like You\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2015) * \\"I Can Never Be Myself When You're Around\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2015) * \\"In Films\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2015) * \\"Shadow\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2015) * \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2015) * \\"Black Walls\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2018) * \\"Blue Girl\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2018) * \\"I'm On Fire\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2018) * \\"Time Rider\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2019) * \\"I Want to Be Alone\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2019) * \\"You're No Good\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2019) * \\"TOY\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2020) * \\"Famous Monsters\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2020) * \\"Teacher\\" (Italians Do It Better, 2020) ===Guest appearances=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - !

It is the home of Brown University's football and outdoor track teams. The athletic teams at Brown University, known as the Bears, compete in the Ivy League. ==Location and description== Brown Stadium is located on Elmgrove Avenue in the city's East Side, approximately 3/4 of a mile from the rest of the athletic facilities and over a mile from the main campus. The architectural design features a trapezoid-shaped southwest stands and a smaller section of concrete bleachers on the northeast side. Stands sit on both sides of the field along with a running track. The press box traverses the entire top of the southwest stands, and the rear of the southwest side includes several ornate \\"B\\" logos and the university's seal, as well as two stone bear's heads on either end of the stands. The stadium's current capacity is 20,000. The largest crowd ever recorded at the stadium was for the Brown vs. Colgate game on Thanksgiving morning 1932; portable bleachers were brought in to accommodate 33,000 fans. ==History== In the early years of Brown sports, the football teams played at Adelaide Park in Elmwood or on the university campus. In 1897, Brown was given land just west of Hope Street about a mile and a half north of campus, on which it built Andrews Field. This combined football/baseball field and running track was used from 1899 to 1925. Brown Stadium, originally known as Brown University Field, constructed on the other side of Hope Street and slightly to the south, was financed entirely by subscription. The new field was dedicated on October 24, 1925, before a crowd of 27,000 spectators. The north stands are considerably smaller than the south ones, designed to allow for future expansion to mirror the large south ones and bring the stadium's fixed seating capacity to 32,000, but this expansion was never constructed. Adjacent to the field was Aldrich Baseball Field, and across Elmgrove Avenue was Marvel Gymnasium, completed in 1927. In 1978 the stadium was completely renovated as part of the football team's 100th anniversary. The original wooden benches were replaced with aluminum. The concrete was restored and waterproofed, and the restrooms, press box, and graphics were painted. an underground sprinkler was installed. In 1991 a new home team locker room and reception room were constructed. The stadium's first night game was played on September 25, 2010, as Brown defeated Harvard, 29‚Äì14, before a crowd of 17,000 fans. ==Notable events== Brown has had many successful teams since the stadium opened, including the Iron Man team of 1926, when eleven players played the entirety of two games and most of a third; the 1976, 1999, 2005, and 2008 Ivy League championship teams; as well as players such as Joe Paterno, former head football coach at Penn State, and several former NFL stars such as Don Colo of the Cleveland Browns and Steve Jordan of the Minnesota Vikings. The stadium hosted the Division I NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship in 1976 and 1985 and two quarterfinal matches of the 2016 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship. ==Gallery== File:BrownStadium1.jpgView from the grandstand, 2008 File:BrownStadium2.jpgAs seen in 2008 File:Game at Brown Stadium, Providence Rhode Island.jpgBrown vs. Cornell, Oct 20, 2018 File:Scoreboard at Brown Stadium, Providence RI.jpgScoreboard ==See also== * List of NCAA Division I FCS football stadiums ==References * Summary at Brownbears.com *\\"Stadium\\" entry in Encyclopedia Brunoniana Category:College football venues Category:Brown Bears football Category:Sports venues in Rhode Island Category:NCAA Men's Division I Lacrosse Championship venues Category:College lacrosse venues in the United States Category:Lacrosse venues in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Providence, Rhode Island Category:Sports venues in Providence County, Rhode Island Category:1925 establishments in Rhode Island Category:Sports venues completed in 1925 Category:American football venues in Rhode Island ","title":"Brown Stadium"},{"id":"2221826","text":"A model mate is a type of pure mate checkmating position in chess in which not only is the checkmated king and all vacant squares in its field attacked only once, and squares in the king's field occupied by friendly units are not also attacked by the mating side (unless such a unit is necessarily pinned to the king), but all units of the mating side (with the possible exception of the king and pawns) participate actively in forming the mating net. Model mates are extremely rare in practical play, but they add value to chess problems as they are considered artistic. In fact, they form the basis of the so-called Bohemian school of chess composition, most fruitful in threemovers and moremovers. Model mates are very usual in helpmates and they appear often in selfmates too. ==Examples== This example shows a problem by Miroslav Havel. The 1. Bc5 gives a flight square for the black king and threatens 2.Rxf6+ Ke4 3.Nf2 with a model mate. The main variations end with model mates from white batteries: :1... Kf4 2. Nxf6 (threat 3.Qg4#) 2... e4 3. Nd7#, and :1... Ke4 2. Nf2+ Kd5 3. Rc7#. There are several other variations (after 1...Ne4 and 1...Ke6), which do not end with model mates, and allow for multiple continuations. In the Bohemian school they are irrelevant, as long as they end with a mate in a prescribed number of moves. This example shows a helpmate, in which both sides cooperate to achieve a mate to the black king. It has two solutions ending in model mates (Black moves first in helpmates): :1. Re3 Ke6 2. Ke4 Rh4#, and :1. Kc5 Kc7 2. Rc4 Nc6#. If all units of both colours are involved in a model mate, then it is an ideal mate.

He was born in the Ukrainian port town of Berdyansk on the Berdyansk Gulf of the Sea of Azov. He studied at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg, Russia (where he was also known as Afanasy Slastyon), researched the Cossack documents in the archives of the Imperial Russian ministry of defense, and later worked as a teacher at the Arts and Crafts School (later renamed the State Ceramics Vocational School) in Myrhorod, Ukraine. A very gifted person, he perfected his talents in singing, bandura playing, ethnography, journalism, education, design, and architecture. Opanas Slastion was a true Ukrainian encyclopaedist. Portrait of kobzar P. Hashchenko by O. Slastion. == Ukraine at the turn of the 19-20th centuries == At the time Slastion was growing up, there were opportunities for some Ukrainians to have their talents recognized in the Imperial capital and in Western Europe. Many gifted Ukrainian performers joined court choirs and theatre, opera, and ballet troupes, and the Ukrainian artists were attracted to the Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg. In the 19th century among these Ukrainian artists was the famous poet and writer Taras Shevchenko, whose writings, etchings and paintings dedicated to Ukrainian ethnographic themes (genre scenes and portraits) greatly influenced Slastion, who became the first illustrator of Shevchenko's 'Kobzar' (the illustrations to \\"Haidamaky\\"). As a painter, Slastion is credited with depicting series of Cossack and kobzar portraits and scenes of Ukrainian country life. Portrait of kobzar Mykhailo Kravchenko by O. Slastion. == Slastion and the kobzars == Slastion was one of the most active propagators of the artistry of the kobzars. Actually, he himself was the first outstanding sighted bandura player and tutor of modern times. Kobzar Ivan Kuchuhura Kucherenko stayed with him in Myrhorod in order to refine his performance of dumy (sung epic poems) under the guidance of Slastion. Danylo Pika, one of the founders of the Poltava Bandurist Capella (who became its conductor), initially learned to play the bandura from Slastion in Myrhorod. Later in his life, in the early 1930s, Slastion designed the shape of the standard Kiev bandura (the familiar modern shape of the instrument). Some other instruments of the bandura family (such as those made by Ivan Skliar, for example) were also modeled on Slastion's designs. == Slastion the ethnographer == Slastion was also a leading Ukrainian folklorist and ethnographer. In 1875, then a student at the Petersburg Academy of Arts and a budding folklorist, he spent his holidays in Ukraine and got the chance to know the artistry of the kobzar Nekhovaizub. In 1876 P. Martynovych and his colleague Slastion travelled to Lokhvytsia and recorded the duma parody by kobzar Ivan Kravchenko. In 1887 Slastion made an engraving of kobzar P. Siroshtan. In 1905 he painted a portrait of kobzar Pavlo Hashchenko and noted that Hashchenko knew four dumy. In 1902-1903 he was one of the initiators of the idea of the preservation of kobzar music by means of sound recording using recently invented phonograph. In 1906 Slastion met the kobzar Zhovniansky, recorded his performances of dumy, and painted his portrait. Portrait of kobzar S. Pasiuha by O. Slastion. In 1908 in Yalta the technically savvy Slastion helped Lesia Ukrainka and her husband Klyment Kvitka make live recordings (on phonograph cylinders) of the dumy performed by the blind virtuoso Hnat Honcharenko (circa 1837 - circa 1917), as part of the major project of the preservation of kobzar music. These recordings were transcribed by Filaret Kolessa, who later published them in his collection Melodiyi ukrayins'kykh narodnykh dum (The Melodies of the Ukrainian Folk Dumas). It is known that Slastion corresponded with another well-known blind kobzar, Tereshko Parkhomenko (1872‚Äì1910). In 1909 Slastion made recordings of the repertoire of kobzar Hovtan, including the duma \\"The Widow and Her Three Sons\\". Selections from Slastion's repertoire originally recorded on wax cylinders can be found on a record released as a dedication to Lesia Ukrainka. As an architect, Opanas Slastion was one of the founding fathers of the \\"Ukrainian Modern\\" style in architecture. == See also  References == * Portrety ukrains'kykh kobzariv (Portraits of the Ukrainian Kobzars).

Chytridiomycosis is an infectious disease in amphibians, caused by the chytrid fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, a non-hyphal zoosporic fungus. Chytridiomycosis has been linked to dramatic population declines or even extinctions of amphibian species in western North America, Central America, South America, eastern Australia, East Africa (Tanzania), and Dominica and Montserrat in the Caribbean. Much of the New World is also at risk of the disease arriving within the coming years. The fungus is capable of causing sporadic deaths in some amphibian populations and 100% mortality in others. No effective measure is known for control of the disease in wild populations. Various clinical signs are seen by individuals affected by the disease. A number of options are possible for controlling this disease-causing fungus, though none has proved to be feasible on a large scale. The disease has been proposed as a contributing factor to a global decline in amphibian populations that apparently has affected about 30% of the amphibian species of the world. Some research found evidence insufficient for linking chytrid fungi and chytridiomycosis to global amphibian declines, but more recent research establishes a connection and attributes the spread of the disease to its transmission through international trade routes into native ecosystems. ==History== Whether chytridiomycosis is a new, emergent pathogen or a pathogen with recently increased virulence is unclear. The disease in its epizootic form was first discovered in 1993 in dead and dying frogs in Queensland, Australia. It had been present in the country since at least 1978 and is widespread across Australia. It is also found in Africa, the Americas, Europe, New Zealand, and Oceania. In Australia, Panama, and New Zealand, the fungus seemed to have suddenly 'appeared' and expanded its range at the same time frog numbers declined. In the Americas, it originated in Venezuela in 1987, where it swept up the continent into Central America. It was also found in the lower part of Central America in 1987, where it spread down to meet the upward sweep from South America. However, it may simply be that the fungus occurs naturally and was only identified recently because it has become more virulent or more prevalent in the environment, or because host populations have become less resistant to the disease. The fungus has been detected in four areas of Australia‚Äîthe east coast, Adelaide, south-west Western Australia and the Kimberley‚Äîand is probably present elsewhere. Among frogs, the oldest documented occurrence of Batrachochytrium is from a specimen of a Titicaca water frog collected in 1863, and among salamanders the oldest was a Japanese giant salamander collected in 1902. However, both these involved strains of the fungus that have not been implicated in mass-mortality events. A later instance of a Bd-infected amphibian was a specimen of an African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) collected in 1938, and this species also appears to be essentially unaffected by the disease, making it a suitable vector.Weldon; du Preez; Hyatt; Muller; and Speare (2004). Origin of the Amphibian Chytrid Fungus. Emerging Infectious Diseases 10(12). The first well-documented method of human pregnancy testing involved this species, and as a result, large-scale international trade in living African clawed frogs began more than 60 years ago. If Batrachochytrium originated in Africa, the African clawed frog is thought to have been the vector of the initial spread out of the continent. The earliest documented case of the disease chytridiomycosis was an American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) collected in 1978. ==Range== The geographic range of chytridiomycosis is difficult to ascertain. If it occurs, the disease is only present where the fungus B. dendrobatidis is present. However, the disease is not always present where the fungus is. Reasons for amphibian declines are often termed ‚Äòenigmatic‚Äô because the cause is unknown. Why some areas are affected by the fungus while others are not is not fully understood. Oscillating factors such as climate, habitat suitability, and population density may be factors which cause the fungus to infect amphibians of a given area. Therefore, when considering the geographic range of chytridiomycosis, the range of B. dendrobatidis occurrence must be considered. The geographic range of B. dendrobatidis has recently been mapped, and spans much of the world. B. dendrobatidis has been detected in 56 of 82 countries, and in 516 of 1240 (42%) species using a data set of more than 36,000 individuals. It is widely distributed in the Americas, and detected sporadically in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Asia, for example, has only 2.35% prevalence. The range suitable for B. dendrobatidis in the New World is vast. Regions with its highest suitability include habitats that contain the world's most diverse amphibian fauna. Areas at risk are the Sierra Madre Pine Oak Occidental Forest, the Sonoran and Sinaloan dry forest, the Veracruz moist forest, Central America east from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the Caribbean Islands, the temperate forest in Chile and western Argentina south of 30¬∞S, the Andes above 1000 m above sea level in Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador, eastern slopes of the Andes in Peru and Bolivia, the Brazilian Atlantic forest, Uruguay, Paraguay, and northeastern Argentina, as well as the southwestern and Madeira‚ÄìTapaj√≥s Amazonian rainforests. Currently, the effects of chytridiomycosis are seen most readily in Central America, eastern Australia, South America, and western North America. ==Climate change== A study suggests that changing global temperatures may be responsible for increased proliferation of chytridiomycosis. The rise in temperature has increased evaporation in certain forest environments that as a result has promoted cloud formation. Experts propose that increased cloud cover might actually be decreasing the daytime temperature by blocking the sun, while at night the cloud cover serves as insulation to raise the nighttime temperature from its normal range. The combination of decreased daytime temperature and increased nighttime temperatures may be providing optimal growth and reproduction for Chytrid fungus which has preferred temperature range between 63¬∞ and 77 ¬∞F (17¬∞ and 25 ¬∞C). The fungus dies at temperatures at and above 30 ¬∞C, which without the cloud cover from increased evaporation is more easily reached by the environment and can, therefore, more easily keep the fungus population in check. ==Causative agents== Chytridiomycosis caused by the fungus B. dendrobatidis predominantly affects the outermost layers of skin containing keratin. When most species reach a B. dendrobatidis threshold of 10,000 zoospores, they are not able to breathe, hydrate, osmoregulate, or thermoregulate correctly. This is proven by blood samples that show a lack of certain electrolytes, such as sodium, magnesium, and potassium. B. dendrobatidis is currently known to have two life stages. The first is the asexual zoosporangial stage. When a host first contracts the disease, spores penetrate the skin and attach themselves using microtubule roots. The second stage takes place when the initial asexual zoosporangia produce motile zoospores. To disperse and infect epidermal cells, a wet surface is needed. A second species of Batrachochytrium, B. salamandrivorans, was discovered in 2013 and is known to cause chytridiomycosis in salamanders. ==Disease transmission and progression== B. dendrobatidis, a waterborne pathogen, disperses zoospores into the environment. The zoospores use flagella for locomotion through water systems until they reach a new host and enter cutaneously. The B. dendrobatidis‚Äô lifecycle continues until new zoospores are produced from the zoosporangium and exit to the environment or reinfect the same host. Once the host is infected with B. dendrobatidis, it can potentially develop chytridiomycosis, but not all infected hosts develop it. Other forms of transmission are currently unknown; however, chytridiomycosis is postulated to be transmitted through direct contact of hosts or through an intermediate host. Much of how B. dendrobatidis is successfully transmitted from one host to the next is largely unknown. Once released into the aquatic environment, zoospores travel less than 2 cm within 24 hours before they encyst. The limited range of B. dendrobatidis zoospores suggest some unknown mechanism exists by which they transmit from one host to the next, which can involve the pet trade, and especially the American bullfrog. Abiotic factors such as temperature, pH level, and nutrient levels affect the success of B. dendrobatidis zoospores. The fungus zoospores can survive within a temperature range of 4‚Äì25 ¬∞C and a pH range of 6‚Äì7. Chytridiomycosis is believed to follow this course: zoospores first encounter amphibian skin and quickly give rise to sporangia, which produce new zoospores. The disease then progresses as these new zoospores reinfect the host. Morphological changes in amphibians infected with the fungus include a reddening of the ventral skin, convulsions with extension of hind limbs, accumulations of sloughed skin over the body, sloughing of the superficial epidermis of the feet and other areas, slight roughening of the surface with minute skin tags, and occasional small ulcers or hemorrhage. Behavioral changes can include lethargy, a failure to seek shelter, a failure to flee, a loss of righting reflex, and abnormal posture (e.g., sitting with the hind legs away from the body). ==Clinical signs== Amphibians infected with B. dendrobatidis have been known to show many different clinical signs. Perhaps the earliest sign of infection is anorexia, occurring as quickly as eight days after being exposed. Individuals infected are also commonly found in a lethargic state, characterized by slow movements, and refuse to move when stimulated. Excessive shedding of skin is seen in most frog species affected by B. dendrobatidis. These pieces of shed skin are described as opaque, gray-white, and tan. Some of these patches of skin are also found adhered to the skin of the amphibians. These signs of infection are often seen 12‚Äì15 days following exposure. The most typical symptom of chytridiomycosis is thickening of skin, which promptly leads to the death of the infected individuals because those individuals cannot take in the proper nutrients, release toxins, or, in some cases, breathe. Other common signs are reddening of the skin, convulsions, and a loss of righting reflex . In tadpoles, B. dendrobatidis affects the mouthparts, where keratin is present, leading to abnormal feeding behaviors or discoloration of the mouth. ==Research and impact== The amphibian chytrid fungus appears to grow best between 17 and 25 ¬∞C, and exposure of infected frogs to high temperatures can cure the frogs.Woodhams, D. C., R. A. Alford, et al. (2003). \\"Emerging disease of amphibians cured by elevated body temperature.\\" Diseases of aquatic organisms 55: 65‚Äì67. In nature, the more time individual frogs were found at temperatures above 25 ¬∞C, the less likely they were to be infected by the amphibian chytrid. This may explain why chytridiomycosis-induced amphibian declines have occurred primarily at higher elevations and during cooler months. Naturally produced cutaneous peptides can inhibit the growth of B. dendrobatidis when the infected amphibians are around temperatures near 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F), allowing species like the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) to clear the infection in about 15% of cases. Although many declines have been credited to the fungus B. dendrobatidis - although likely prematurely so in many cases \\\\- some species resist the infection and some populations can survive with a low level of persistence of the disease. In addition, some species that seem to resist the infection may actually harbor a nonpathogenic form of B. dendrobatidis. Some researchers contend the focus on chytridiomycosis has made amphibian conservation efforts dangerously myopic. A review of the data in the IUCN Red List found the threat of the disease was assumed in most cases, but no evidence shows, in fact, it is a threat. Conservation efforts in New Zealand continue to be focused on curing the critically endangered native Archey's frog, Leiopelma archeyi, of chytridiomycosis, though research has shown clearly that they are immune from infection by B. dendrobatidis and are dying in the wild of other still-to-be identified diseases.Waldman B (2011) Brief encounters with Archey's Frog. FrogLog 99:39‚Äì41. In Guatemala, several thousand tadpoles perished from an unidentified pathogen distinct from B. dendrobatidis. A 2019 Science review assessed that chytridiomycosis was a factor in the decline of at least 501 amphibian species during the past 50 years, of which 90 species were confirmed or presumed to have gone extinct in the wild and another 124 had declined in numbers by more than 90%. The review characterized the overall toll as the \\"greatest recorded loss of biodiversity attributable to a disease\\". However, a follow-up study in Science found the 2019 study by Scheele et al. to be lacking in the necessary evidence to make these claims and found the conclusions could not be reproduced with the original study's data and methods. It remains unclear how many and which species have been impacted by chytridiomycosis, but there are good data for a limited number of species such as the mountain yellow-legged frog in the Sierra Nevada mountains. ==Immunity== Due to the fungus' immense impact on amphibian populations, considerable research has been undertaken to devise methods to combat its proliferation in the wild. Among the most promising is the revelation that amphibians in colonies that survive the passage of the chytrid epidemic tend to carry higher levels of the bacterium Janthinobacterium lividum. This bacterium produces antifungal compounds, such as indole-3-carboxaldehyde and violacein, that inhibit the growth of B. dendrobatidis even at low concentrations. Similarly, the bacterium Lysobacter gummosus found on the red- backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus), produces the compound 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol that is inhibitory to the growth of B. dendrobatidis. Understanding the interactions of microbial communities present on amphibians' skin with fungal species in the environment can reveal why certain amphibians, such as the frog Rana muscosa, are susceptible to the fatal effects of B. dendrobatidis and why others, such as the salamander Hemidactylium scutatum, are able to coexist with the fungus. As mentioned before, the antifungal bacterial species Janthinobacterium lividum, found on several amphibian species, has been shown to prevent the effects of the pathogen even when added to another amphibian that lacks the bacteria (B. dendrobatidis-susceptible amphibian species). Interactions between cutaneous microbiota and B. dendrobatidis can be altered to favor the resistance of the disease, as seen in past studies concerning the addition of the violacein- producing bacteria J. lividum to amphibians that lacked sufficient violacein, allowing them to inhibit infection. Although the exact concentration of violacein (antifungal metabolite produced by J. lividum) needed to inhibit the effects of B. dendrobatidis is not fully confirmed, violacein concentration can determine whether or not an amphibian will experience morbidity (or mortality) caused by B. dendrobatidis. The frog Rana muscosa, for example, has been found to have very low concentrations of violacein on its skin, yet the concentration is so small, it is unable to facilitate increased survivability of the frog; furthermore, J. lividum has not been found to be present on the skin of R. muscosa. This implies that the antifungal bacterium J. lividum (native to other amphibians' skin, such as Hemidactylium scutatum) is able to produce a sufficient amount of violacein to prevent infection by B. dendrobatidis and allow coexistence with the potentially deadly fungus. One study has postulated that the water flea Daphnia magna eats the spores of the fungus. ==Interactions with pesticides== The hypothesis that pesticide use has contributed to declining amphibian populations has been suggested several times in the literature. Interactions between pesticides and chytridiomycosis were examined in 2007, and sublethal exposure to the pesticide carbaryl (a cholinesterase inhibitor) was shown to increase susceptibility of foothill yellow-legged frogs (Rana boylii) to chytridiomycosis. In particular, the skin peptide defenses were significantly reduced after exposure to carbaryl, suggesting pesticides may inhibit this innate immune defence, and increase susceptibility to disease. == Evolution == Hints of emerging evolutionary resistance in a rebounding population of an afflicted frog species were reported from ecological study of an epizootically endangered stream-breeding frog Mixophyes fleayi reported from subtropical Australia. Rebound of frog species in Panama after decline are not associated with pathogen attenuation, but rather a host factor - whether an evolved genetic resistance to the fungus infection, or an otherwise acquired trait (such as a hypothetically protective microbial colonization) is yet to be identified. == Treatment options == Zoosporangia of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis strain 98-1810/3 visible as transparent spherical bodies growing in lake water on (a) freshwater arthropod and (b) algae. The use of antifungals and heat-induced therapy has been suggested as a treatment of B. dendrobatidis. However, some of these antifungals may cause adverse skin effects on certain species of frogs, and although they are used to treat species that are infected by chytridiomycosis, the infection is never fully eradicated. A study done by Rollins-Smith and colleagues suggests that itraconazole is the antifungal of choice when it comes to treatment of Bd. This is favored in comparison to amphotericin B and chloramphenicol because of their toxicity‚Äîspecifically chloramphenicol, as it is correlated with leukemia in toads. This becomes a difficult situation because without treatment, frogs will suffer from limb deformities and even death, but may also suffer skin abnormalities with treatment. \\"Treatment is not always 100% successful and not all amphibians tolerate treatment very well, therefore chytridiomycosis should always be treated with the advice of a veterinarian.\\" Individuals infected with B. dendrobatidis are bathed in itraconazole solutions, and within a few weeks, previously infected individuals test negative for B. dendrobatidis using PCR assays. Heat therapy is also used to neutralize B. dendrobatidis in infected individuals. Temperature-controlled laboratory experiments are used to increase the temperature of an individual past the optimal temperature range of B. dendrobatidis. Experiments, where the temperature is increased beyond the upper bound of the B. dendrobatidis optimal range of 25 to 30 ¬∞C, show its presence will dissipate within a few weeks and individuals infected return to normal. Formalin/malachite green has also been used to successfully treat individuals infected with chytridiomycosis. An Archey's frog was successfully cured of chytridiomycosis by applying chloramphenicol topically. However, the potential risks of using antifungal drugs on individuals are high. ==See also== * Emerging infectious diseases * White nose syndrome * Gastric-brooding frog * Golden toad *Guajira stubfoot toad *Rabb's Fringe-limbed Treefrog *Holocene extinction ==References External links == * Article in National Geographic Magazine, April 2009 * Wildlife Trade and Global Disease Emergence * Main preventive management strategies for the Chytrid fungus * Amphibian chytridiomycosis at Amphibian Diseases Home Page * 'Amphibian Ark' aims to save frogs from fungus Category:Amphibian diseases Category:Animal fungal diseases ","title":"Chytridiomycosis"},{"id":"2221854","text":"William Clarke McKinnell (September 29, 1873 ‚Äì October 27, 1939) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada.

He was educated at Bedford Modern School from 1887 until 1889. He registered with the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain as an apprentice to his father, a Northampton chemist, but abandoned this pursuit to go to Canada in 1892. By 1894 he was homesteading in Melita, Manitoba but later moved to Teulon, Manitoba where he opened the town's first store, McKinnell and Wood General Store. In 1901, McKinnell married Christina Margaret Wood. He served as chair of the school board in Teulon, Manitoba from 1907 to 1921 and was appointed as chair of the Winnipeg Suburban Municipal Board in 1925. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1920 provincial election. Running as a Farmer candidate, he defeated Liberal incumbent Arthur Lobb by a single vote (978 to 977) in the Rockwood constituency. McKinnell served with the Independent-Farmer caucus in the parliament which followed. He ran for re-election in the 1922 election as a candidate of the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM), and was easily returned over candidates of the Liberal and Conservative parties. The UFM unexpectedly won a majority of seats in this election, and formed government as the Progressive Party. McKinnell served as a backbench supporter of John Bracken's government. McKinnell was easily re-elected in the campaigns of 1927 and 1932. He was defeated in the 1936 election, losing to Conservative Mungo Lewis by 383 votes. After retiring from politics, he worked as a supervisor of municipalities.

He previously played with the New Jersey Devils and the San Jose Sharks of the NHL. ==Playing career== White played Midget hockey for the Weeks Major Midget AAA in New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, before being drafted 49th overall in the 1996 NHL Entry Draft by the New Jersey Devils. In 1997, White won the Memorial Cup with the Hull Olympiques. White had his best season production-wise during the 2000‚Äì01 season, where he put up 20 points, helping the Devils to the Stanley Cup finals. During the 2007‚Äì08 pre-season, White suffered a serious eye injury. During a team practice on September 19, \\"White was defending against two-on-one rushes when John Madden gave rookie Nicklas Bergfors the puck for a shot that deflected off White's stick and hit him in the nose and near the right eye.\\" White was able to return to the lineup on November 21 to play in the Devils' 2‚Äì1 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins. Despite still suffering from some blurred vision in his right eye, he was able to play over 17 minutes, blocked 2 shots, and was credited with six of the Devils' fifteen hits. White quickly returned to his regular spot in the Devils line-up, where he began wearing a protective visor on his helmet. In the 2008‚Äì09 season, White played 71 games, finishing the season with one goal, 17 assists and a +18 rating, one of his highest career offensive seasons. On February 2, 2010, for the first time in nearly four years, White fought Maple Leafs defensemen Dion Phaneuf for taking a run at teammate Zach Parise's head. Had White been hit near his previously injured eye during the fight, his career could have been in jeopardy. The following season, White fought for the second time in as many years when he dropped the gloves with Bruno Gervais of the New York Islanders. White had previously hit P. A. Parenteau, which sparked the fight that ended with White fracturing Gervais' cheekbone. White established himself as physical, defensive defenceman, often leading the Devils in penalty minutes to go with his relatively low offensive production. During his Devils tenure, White served several times as an alternate captain. On August 1, 2011, White was placed on waivers by the New Jersey Devils along with Trent Hunter. He was then bought out from the final year of his contract on August 2 after clearing. On August 3, White was signed by the San Jose Sharks to a 1-year, $1M contract. On May 31, 2012, it was announced that White's jersey number 24 was to be retired by his junior team the Gatineau Olympiques, formerly the Hull Olympiques. He became the fifth player to have his jersey retired, joining the likes of Luc Robitaille and Jose Theodore, on November 8, 2012. At the conclusion of the 2012‚Äì13 NHL lockout, after White accepted an invitation to the St. Louis Blues training camp, on January 18, 2013, the Blues announced that they had released White from his professional tryout. ==Post-retirement== White is an ambassador for the New Jersey Devils' alumni association along with Bruce Driver, Ken Daneyko, Grant Marshall and Jim Dowd.http://fireandice.northjersey.com/fire-ice-1.174987/colin-white- happy-to-be-back-with-devils-as-part-of-alumni-association-1.1148765 ==Personal== White has three children: Hunter, who plays for the Montclair Blues Hockey club, Jordyn, and Cale.http://www.ottawasun.com/2014/12/29/former-olympiques-star-colin-white- returns-with-son White grew up in New Glasgow, N.S.

For the 1996 CART season, it was the first of two events at Michigan, the second being the traditional Marlboro 500 in July. Tony George, owner of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, formed the Indy Racing League as an alternative to CART. While the Indianapolis 500 had continued to be sanctioned by the United States Auto Club (USAC) since the formation of CART in 1979, CART teams and drivers represented the vast majority of the Indy field, and USAC had taken steps to ensure that the technical specifications for Indy did not preclude CART teams from participating. In 1996, however, following his creation of the IRL, George stipulated that 25 of the 33 starting positions at Indy would be reserved for the top 25 cars which ran events in his series. This move created potential scheduling conflicts with CART-sanctioned events. Interpreting this policy as a lockout of CART teams, the CART board agreed to stage the U.S. 500 at an alternative venue on Memorial Day weekend, the traditional date for the Indianapolis 500. George, on the other hand, viewed the refusal of CART teams to compete for the remaining eight positions on the Indy grid as a walkout/boycott. While the Indianapolis 500 has a history of one-off participants (teams and drivers who participate in only the single race and not in other series events), the field for the U.S. 500 were comprised almost exclusively of teams and drivers who participated in the full CART season, as CART was formed of franchises owned by the various team owners, which formed the organization in 1978. CART franchise owners were required to field teams for all races. ==Timeline== *CART officially announces the inaugural running of the U.S. 500 on December 18, 1995, at a press conference in Chicago. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway immediately released a reaction expressing its disappointment of CART in what it called a \\"negative impact on automobile racing.\\" *On March 4, 1996, a total of twelve corporate sponsors were announced for the U.S. 500. In addition, telephone orders through Ticketmaster began offering tickets to the event. *On March 20, 1996, ticket sales for the event were attempted to be boosted by a \\"doubleheader\\" ticket for the U.S. 500 and the CART event at Detroit on June 9. *On April 25, 1996, it was announced that the Vanderbilt Cup would be recreated and awarded to the winner of the U.S. 500. *Despite CART's efforts to broadcast the race on network TV, ESPN was chosen in March to air the race. In addition, instead of being able to broadcast directly against the Indianapolis 500, the event had to be scheduled for 2p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, two hours after the start at Indy. CART had attempted to lure NBC or Fox, but neither deal came through. Fox wanted to show the race in primetime, which would have flatly defeated the purpose of racing the same day as the Indy 500, and in fact would have conflicted with the broadcast of the race with that of the Coca-Cola 600 on TBS instead. ==Inaugural event== CART scheduled what was billed as a \\"Special Qualifying Session\\" for the U.S. 500 on the weekend of May 11‚Äì12, 1996. Cold temperatures and reported snow flurries hampered the session at Michigan, although it was completed as scheduled. The move was exclusive in that all other CART events featured qualifying the same weekend of the race. Qualifying directly conflicted with the first weekend of qualifying for the Indianapolis 500. The move effectively prevented teams potentially competing at both events from having hopes of qualifying for the pole position at both races. Teams would return two weeks later for the race. Jimmy Vasser won the first such race in 1996, which was notable for its disastrous start. With the cars lined up in rows of three (the traditional starting formation of the Indy 500), Vasser, on pole, was about to take the green flag at the start, when he was struck by Adrian Fernandez. Fernandez then tagged Bryan Herta, and the resulting accident took out a number of cars. Though ten cars had wrecked out, CART allowed teams to bring out backup cars and make repairs to heavily- damaged cars; this hurt the credibility of CART for allowing what normally would have been DNFs to come back out as though nothing had happened; years earlier Roberto Guerrero, the polesitter for the 1992 Indianapolis 500, crashed on the pace lap and was ruled a DNF. With the victory, Vasser won over $1 million and had his likeness inscribed onto the Vanderbilt Cup. In addition, an American flag was waved along with the twin checkered flags to end the race. ===Results=== {  border=\\"1\\" - ! Pos. ! Start ! Driver ! No. ! C ! E ! T ! Laps ! Status !

The race, as it had been initially created, was discontinued. The success of the event was questionable, and the remaining reasons to hold the event were the subject of considerable debate. Teams and officials also were not keen on racing at the same facility twice in the same season. From 1997-1999, instead of creating a direct conflict, on the day before the Indianapolis 500, CART scheduled a race at the newly opened Gateway International Speedway as their Memorial Day weekend alternative. The race, however, experienced much less interest, and was eventually moved to August. Starting in 1997, the Indy Racing League adopted new chassis and engine rules that were not compatible with the equipment used by CART teams, thus any teams choosing to race at Indianapolis would have to purchase all new machines. After experiencing unforeseen problems unrelated to the CART boycott, the IRL's 25/8 restriction for the Indianapolis 500 was dropped after the 1997 race. No CART team, however, would return to Indianapolis until 2000. In 1997, Penske Corporation and CART added a season-ending race for the Champ Cars at California Speedway. As a result, some name-shuffling ensued. The Marlboro 500 name, which had been used for the 500-mile event held at Michigan in July or August from 1987 to 1996, was given to the new fall California Speedway race. The U.S. 500 was in turn the name given to the annual summer Michigan race, now being held in July, from 1997-1999\\\\. In the 1998 race, three spectators were killed and six more injuredMotorsport.com: News channel when a wheel from Adrian Fern√°ndez's car flew into the grandstands during a crash on lap 175 of the 250 lap race. CART was widely criticized for not stopping the race in deference to the dead and injured fans, though races in previous years were not stopped despite fatalities. CART's own investigation determined that the casualties were the result of an \\"accidental racing incident.\\"Motorsport.com: News channel However, the track's fences were quickly extended by an additional four feet in an attempt to contain debris from future crashes.Motorsport.com: News channel In 2000, the U.S. 500 name was dropped permanently as the race was changed to the Michigan 500 presented by Toyota, and in its last year, 2001, it was known as the Harrah's 500. In 2002, the race switched alliances to the Indy Racing League, and became what was known as the Firestone Indy 400. ==Past winnersCART Champ Car history=== {  style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" - !

Sergio Pignedoli (4 June 1910 ‚Äì 15 June 1980) was a prominent Italian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church and a top candidate for Pope. He served as deputy to Pope Paul VI, and as President of the Secretariat for Non-Christians from 1973 to 1980. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1973. A towering figure in the Roman Catholic Church, cardinal Sergio Pignedoli was Pope Paul VI closest ally and confidant, and was widely expected to succeed him as Pope. Following the death of Paul VI in 1978, cardinal Sergio Pignedoli was the leading contender to be elected Pope. He was featured in numerous publications around the world, including on the covers of Time and Newsweek as the next Pope. In the August 1978 conclave, cardinal Pignedoli, the progressive candidate, received nearly half of the votes of the college of cardinals. His main opponent was the conservative cardinal Giuseppe Siri of Genova, though since both of these legendary cardinals were unable to obtain a majority, a compromise candidate has emerged, and Albino Luciani was elected as Pope John Paul I. Thirty three days later, following the sudden death of John Paul I, a second conclave convened in October 1978. Cardinal Pignedoli was again the leading contender for the papacy, but ultimately Karol J√≥zef Wojty≈Ça of Poland was elected as Pope John Paul II. In 1975, at the request of Pope Paul VI, cardinal Sergio Pignedoli, the second most powerful Vatican figure after the Pope, has developed a close, secret, friendship and alliance with a young, super-gifted, Jewish scientist and scholar descended from the House of Kalonymus. Their close cooperation laid the foundation for the establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and the Vatican, thus ending two thousand years of animosity and persecution by Christians and the Holy See against the Jews. ==Biography== Born in Felina di Reggio Emilia, Sergio Pignedoli studied at the seminary in Reggio Emilia, the Catholic University of Milan (where he received a doctorate in ancient studies), the Pontifical Lateran University (obtaining a doctorate in theology), and the Pontifical Gregorian University (master's in ecclesiastical history) before being ordained a priest on 1 April 1933. He then served as vice-rector of the seminary in Reggio Emilia until 1934, at which time he became a chaplain at the Catholic University of Milan. During World War II, from 1940 to 1943, Pignedoli served as a navy chaplain, and continued his work as a chaplain in Azione Cattolica and the Italian Boy Scouts. Named Monsignor on 5 September 1949, he was also the Secretary of the Central Committee for the 1950 Holy Year, on which he commented, \\"This year's great discovery is that in a world apparently skeptical and indifferent, there's a vigorous current of faith\\".Time Magazine. End of the Year 1 January 1951 On 22 December 1950, he was appointed Titular Archbishop of Iconium and Nuncio to Bolivia. Pignedoli received episcopal consecration on 11 February 1951 from Cardinal Adeodato Giovanni Piazza, OCD, with Archbishop Valerio Valeri and Bishop Beniamino Socche serving as co-consecrators, in the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. After serving as Nuncio to Bolivia for four years, he was named Nuncio to Venezuela on 19 October 1954. On 15 April 1955, he was named Auxiliary Bishop of Milan, where he remained until 23 September 1960; during his time in Milan, Pignedoli established a deep friendship with Giovanni Battista Montini that continued into the latter's rise to the papacy. From 1960 until 1967, he held the positions of Apostolic Delegate to Western and Central Africa (1960-1964) and to Canada (1964-1967). Pignedoli also attended the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). Pope Paul VI appointed Pignedoli as Secretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples on 10 June 1967. He was created Cardinal-Deacon of S. Giorgio al Velabro by Paul VI in the consistory of 5 March 1973. On the following day, 6 March, he became the second President of the Secretariat for Non-Christians (later renamed the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue by Pope John Paul II on 28 June 1988). On 24 May 1974, before his trip to West Africa, Cardinal Pignedoli joined by Monsignor Verrazano, met with A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Together they had an hour-long dialogue about social analysis and outreach ministry. Pignedoli also established close friendships with Sh≈çch≈ç Hagami, a great acharya of Tendai Buddhism and one of the most prominent Japanese Buddhists of the 20th century, who played a leading role in promoting mutual respect and reconciliation among three monotheistic religions from an Asian side. In his capacity of cardinal, Pignedoli was one of the electors in the conclaves of August and October 1978, which selected Pope John Paul I and Pope John Paul II respectively. He was considered by many as a papabile in both of those conclaves.Time Magazine. After Paul: The Leading Contenders 21 August 1978Time Magazine.

Kiryat Mattersdorf () is a Haredi neighborhood in Jerusalem. It is located on the northern edge of the mountain plateau on which central Jerusalem lies. It is named after Mattersburg (formerly Mattersdorf), a town in Austria with a long Jewish history. It borders Kiryat Itri and Romema. The main thoroughfare is Panim Meirot Street, which segues into Sorotzkin Street at the neighborhood's eastern end. In 2015, Kiryat Mattersdorf had approximately 700 residents.

Hamodia Israel News, 23 August 2012, p. A14. The outermost street in the neighborhood is named Maaneh Simcha, after his father's Torah work. Akiva Ehrenfeld moved to Kiryat Mattersdorf in the early 1990s, and served as president of all these institutions. Akiva Ehrenfeld also founded Yeshivas Beis Shmuel, named for his father, in the mid-1980s. The cornerstone for the neighborhood was laid in spring 1963, and the first apartments were ready for occupancy in May 1965. The first occupants included Rabbi Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg and his wife Bessie; his son Rabbi Simcha Scheinberg and his family; his daughter Rebbetzin Fruma Rochel Altusky and her family; and more than 20 students from Rabbi Chaim Scheinberg's yeshiva, Torah Ore.

Kiryat Mattersdorf was the first neighborhood to be built in northern Jerusalem; it was joined in subsequent years by Kiryat Itri, Kiryat Unsdorf, Kiryat Sanz, and HaMem Gimmel Street of northern Romema. For many years, the neighborhood was situated on Jerusalem's northern border, facing Jordanian strongholds across the valley in present-day Ramot. The main street has always been known as Rechov Panim Meirot (Panim Meirot Street), after the sefer Panim Meirot by Rabbi Meir Eisenshtadt. === Austrian ties=== Akiva Ehrenfeld established close ties with the government of Austria to obtain funding for several institutions, including Neveh Simcha and a kindergarten. Following an official state visit to Israel by Austrian President Thomas Klestil in 1994, which included a side tour of Kiryat Mattersdorf, Klestil hosted Ehrenfeld at an official reception at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna on January 24, 1995.

She performed with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes from 1909 to 1911 and then quit to form her own company. Bol√©ro by Ravel (1928) was among her commissions. == Biography  Early life and family=== Rubinstein was born into one of Russia's richest families, to Jewish parents in Kharkov, Russian Empire, and grew up in Saint Petersburg. For many years, it was a mystery whether she was born in Kharkov or Saint Petersburg, complicated by the rumour that \\"Ida\\" was short for \\"Adelaida\\". Rubinstein herself would not confirm where she was born, nor if Ida was a nickname, preferring the aura of mystery. Years after her death, the record was discovered in the archives of the Kharkov Choral Synagogue, where her father had been a board member: the birth of a daughter, Ida Lvovna, on 21 September (O.S., N.S. 5 October), to father Lev Ruvimovich, Honorary Citizen of Kharkov, and mother Ernestina Isaakovna Rubinstein, had been dutily recorded in the registry for 1883. She had an older sister, Rachel, born in 1876. Ida's grandfather, Ruvim (Roman) Rubinstein, had been a successful sugar trader in Kharkov. He moved to Saint Petersburg, where he founded the company Roman Rubinstein & Sons with his two sons, Lev (Leon) and Adolf (Anton). The family multiplied their investment many times over, becoming millionaires by the time Ida was born. The family expanded to own several banks, including the First Bank of Kharkov, sugar mills and breweries. The family donated large sums of money to charities, particularly the arts. Lev and Adolf were both well educated; they regularly hosted prominent intellectuals and artists in their home. Adolf's son Iosif became a successful pianist who studied under Franz Liszt. Her mother died when Ida was very young, and in 1892, her father died in Frankfurt, leaving her a vast fortune. In 1893, the 8-year-old Ida was sent to Saint Petersburg to live with her aunt, socialite \\"Madame\\" Gorvits (Horwitz). Rubinstein grew up in her aunt's mansion on the city's famed Promenade des Anglais, where she was given the best education. She became fluent in English, French, German and Italian. When she became interested in Ancient Greece, a Greek professor was invited to tutor her in Saint Petersburg. She was also given the best instruction in music, dance and theatre, including lessons from instructors from the Russian imperial theatres. She lacked natural dance ability, but she worked constantly on her posture, movements and pirouettes. Eventually, secretly intent on going on stage herself, she went to Paris under the guise of continuing her education. ===Professional years=== Scheherazade, 1910 Rubinstein as Saint Sebastian in the play The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian, 1911 Rubinstein in 1922 In Paris, Rubinstein began her career as an actress, appearing on stage in various stages of \\"indecent\\" garb. The news reached Saint Petersburg and the ears of her conservative Orthodox family. While it was perfectly respectable for the upper class to be seen at the theatre, being an actress was no different from being a prostitute in the eyes of her horrified relatives. Her brother-in-law, a Parisian doctor named Lewinsohn (Levinson), had her declared legally insane in order to commit her to a mental asylum to save the family's honor. Her family in Kharkov and Saint Petersburg, unhappy with her being in an asylum, demanded she be released and sent home. Once in Saint Petersburg, she was chaperoned at all times by her governess, as was customary for an unmarried young woman of her social class. To earn her freedom and right to control her fortune, she married her first cousin Vladimir Gorvits, who was madly in love with her and allowed her to travel and perform. She had, by the standard of Russian ballet, little formal training. Tutored by Mikhail Fokine, she made her debut in 1908. This was a single private performance of Oscar Wilde's Salom√©, in which she stripped nude in the course of the Dance of the Seven Veils. Sergei Diaghilev took her with the Ballets Russes and she danced the title role of Cl√©op√¢tre in the Paris season of 1909, and Zob√©ide in Scheherazade in 1910. Both exotic ballets were choreographed by Fokine, and designed by L√©on Bakst. The finale of Cl√©op√¢tre inspired Kees van Dongen's Souvenir of the Russian Opera Season 1909. Her partner in Scheherazade was the great Vaslav Nijinsky. Scheherazade was admired at the time for its racy sensuality and sumptuous staging, but these days it is rarely performed; to modern tastes, it is considered too much of a pantomime and its then fashionable Orientalism appears dated. Rubinstein left the Ballets Russes in 1911.Crane, Debra & Mackrell, Judith 2000. The Oxford Dictionary of Dance. Oxford University Press, Oxford. === Rubinstein companies === After leaving the Ballets Russes, Rubinstein formed her own dance company, using her inherited wealth, and commissioned several lavish productions. In 1911, she performed in Le Martyre de Saint Sebastien. The creative team was Fokine (choreography); Bakst (design); Gabriele d'Annunzio (text) and score by Debussy. This was both a triumph for its stylized modernism and a scandal; the Archbishop of Paris prohibited Catholics from attending because St. Sebastian was being played by a woman and a Jew. After the First World War, Rubinstein appeared in a number of plays, and in Staat's Istar at the Paris Opera in 1924. She also played the leading role in the 1921 silent film La Nave based on D'Annunzio's play of the same name and directed by his son.Goble, Alan (2011). The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film, p. 105. Walter de Gruyter. Between 1928 and 1929, she directed her own company in Paris with Nijinska as choreographer. She commissioned and performed in Maurice Ravel's Bol√©ro in 1928. Other works developed in 1928 were Massine's David, with music by Sauguet; and Le Baiser de la f√©e, with music by Stravinsky, and choreography by Nijinska. The repertoire also included The Firebird (L'Oiseau de Feu) with music by Stravinsky, and choreography by Fokine; this had been one of the most sensational creations for the Ballets Russes. The company was revived in 1931 and 1934, with new works. She closed the company in 1935, and gave her last performance in the play Jeanne d'Arc au b√ªcher in Paris, 1939. Rubinstein often staged free ballet events and continued to dance until the start of the Second World War. ===Later life=== Rubinstein is not considered to be in the top tier of ballerinas; she began her training too late for that to have been possible. She did, however, have tremendous stage presence and was able to act. She was also a significant patron and she tended to commission works that suited her abilities, works that mixed dance with drama and stagecraft. In 1934, the French government awarded her the L√©gion d'honneur, and then in 1939 the Grand Cross of the L√©gion, its highest honor. In 1935, she was awarded honorary French citizenship, and in 1936 she converted to Roman Catholicism.Web page on her later life In 1940, she left France during the German invasion, and made her way to England via Algeria and Morocco. There she helped wounded Free French soldiers until 1944. Walter Guinness (later Lord Moyne), her long-term lover and sponsor, remained supportive, providing a suite at the Ritz Hotel, until he was assassinated by the Stern Gang in late 1944.Joe Joyce; The Guinnesses Poolbeg Press, Dublin 2009, chapter 11. She returned to France after the war, living finally at Les Olivades in Vence. Rubinstein lived the final 10 years of her life in relative quiet. She died in 1960 in Vence, France, and is buried nearby. ==Images and paintings== Valentin Serov, portrait of Ida as Salom√©, 1910. Romaine Brooks, Le Trajet, c. 1911. Rubinstein was much celebrated in art. Her portrait by Valentin Serov in 1910 marks the most complete realization of his mature style. The Art Deco sculptor Demetre Chiparus produced a Rubinstein figurine, and she was also painted by Antonio de la Gandara and Jacques-√âmile Blanche. Costume designer L√©on Bakst created numerous images of Rubinstein in various roles. Rubinstein did not like long sittings and earned the reputation of being a difficult subject. For this reason, Blanche and others preferred to work from photographs. Rubinstein was bisexual,Secrest, Meryle (1974). Between Me and Life: A Biography of Romaine Brooks, Garden City, NY: Doubleday. . and in 1911 she began a three-year affair with the painter Romaine Brooks, who created several striking portraits, including one of the dancer as a nude model for Venus. Brooks' portraits were based on \\"an extraordinary series of photographs taken by Brooks at the time\\".Bentley, Toni Sisters of Salome. 2002. New Haven: Yale University Press, p146. Brooks explained Rubinstein's allure to her audiences and artists as follows: > It was Ida Rubinstein's elusive quality that fascinated. She expressed an > inner self that had no particular denomination. Her beauty belonged to those > mental images that demand manifestation, and whatever period she represented > she became its image. In reality she was the crystallization of a poet's > image, a painter's vision, and as such she possessed further significance > ... It was her gift for impersonating the beauty of every √©poque, that > marked Ida Rubinstein as unique. ==See also== * Place des √âtats-Unis * List of Russian ballet dancers ==NotesAdditional references== * Toni Bentley (2005) Sisters of Salome, Bison Books, * Michael de Cossart, Ida Rubinstein (1885‚Äì1960): A Theatrical Life, Liverpool University Press, * Vicki Woolf, The Story of Ida Rubinstein: Dancing in the Vortex, harwood academic publishers, 2000, * La nave (directed by Gabriellino d'Annunzio) on the Internet Movie Database ==External links== *Ida Rubinstein at JSSGallery.org Category:1883 births Category:1960 deaths Category:Russian Jews Category:Jewish dancers Category:LGBT Jews Category:LGBT people from Russia Category:Bisexual women Category:Prima ballerinas Category:Ballets Russes dancers Category:White Russian emigrants to France Category:Grand Croix of the L√©gion d'honneur Category:Dancers from Kharkiv Category:People from Saint Petersburg Category:Russian artists' models Category:Russian ballerinas Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Judaism Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to France Category:20th-century ballet dancers ","title":"Ida Rubinstein"},{"id":"2221961","text":"A chess composer is a person who creates endgame studies or chess problems. Chess composers usually specialize in a particular genre, e.g. endgame studies, twomovers, threemovers, moremovers, helpmates, selfmates, or fairy problems. Moreover, composers have their own preferred style of composing, allowing their sorting according to composition schools. Some chess composers produce huge numbers of chess compositions, while others try to achieve as much quality as possible and present new works only rarely. It is possible for chess composers to gain official FIDE titles, usually for a given number of problems published in FIDE Albums. For example, Milan Vukcevich was an International Grandmaster of Chess Composition, as well as an International Master player. The PCCC (Permanent Commission for Chess Composition) is a branch of FIDE regulating the awarding of titles such as International Grandmaster, International master, Master FIDE and International Judge for chess composition. ==Schools of composition== Composition school in chess composition is a particular style of creating chess problems, putting emphasis on different aspects of the problem contents and attracting interest of important number of chess composers. The best-known composition schools, as they evolved historically, are: * Old German school put emphasis on complexity and difficulty of solution and model mate in the main variation, the most suitable genres being fourmovers and fivemovers; * Bohemian school puts emphasis on artistic beauty and number of variations finished by model mates, the most suitable genres being threemovers and fourmovers; * English school demanded dual-free play in all variations and put emphasis on varied motivation in high number of variations; * American school puts emphasis on originality and presence of surprising elements in the solution; * New German school (also known as logical school) requires logical structure of solution and purity (or economy) of aim, the longer genres are more suitable; * New Bohemian school combines requirements of new German school and Bohemian school; * Strategical school puts emphasis on complexity of motivation in high number of variations, both defence and harmful motifs should be unified whenever possible, mostly in twomovers and threemovers; * Soviet school is a highly developed level of strategic school; * New-strategical school requires changes of variations or move functions between phases; * Slovak school requires changes of motifs between phases. Besides clearly attributable chess problems there are many ones that might be attributed to none of these or to more of them. Today, many chess composers do work in the area of multiple schools regularly. ==Notable chess composers== * Edith Bairdbillwall. \\"Great Chess Composers\\".

(Not to be confused with the female vocal artist Aubrey Ayala.) ==Early life and education== Allen grew up in the suburbs of Portsmouth. When he moved to Cowplain, he had a red nose as a result of having a cold. As the new boy at school, he was teased as having a nose like the contemporary animation character Aubrey (TV series), and the nickname stuck. As an adolescent, Aubrey became interested in hip-hop. As well as being the leader of the 247 crew (of breakdancers), he is one of the few people from the area to have attended UK Fresh 86. As well as an interest in hip-hop, Aubrey also had an interest in the Chicago sound. ==Early career== In the summer of 1989, Aubrey got his first booking at a warehouse rave. It was at this time that he started to regularly attend Thursday nights at Top Cats in North End (now the Post Office social club) where he met DJ Pete Couzens, and his peers (Dave Nutbeem, Trevor Mann, Ghost, Jake Marsh, Starry, Johnny Pain and others). Newbeat Promotions Organizers Jim (MC Lucky)....Pete Cohman...And Brendan Oneill.......Got Aubrey His First Gigs At Central Park.....After Playing A Tape To Dave Joyce in PowerHouse Records ==Career== Aubrey became a regular at Central Park at Ritzy's nightclub, and this later lead to regular nights at Sterns Nightclub in Worthing. As well as DJing, he could often be found behind the counter in Razzle's on a Saturday, and later went to work in the rival Jelly Jam outlet. As well as DJing, he turned his hand to music making with the nascent Solid Groove label. (Not to be confused with Dave Taylor, who is signed to Classic Records, who uses the moniker Swing and Solid Groove.) He also opened a record shop with the name Solid Groove on Albert Road. The shop was in existence from February 1995 onwards. Working with him in the shop was Mark Ambrose. Sam Foot was involved in the artwork and the design of the Solid Groove logo, as well as doing album artwork for Luke Slater. It was at this time that as well as Solid Groove releases making headway in the States, and appearing in top 10 playlists, it seemed to herald a south coast explosion occurring, with the successes of Steve Paton (Intelligence Records), Russ Gabriel (Ferox) and Mark Ambrose (Crayon) as both artists and DJs. Both Aubrey and Mark are frequently cited as key individuals in the Tech house genre. In addition to producing, he worked as a music lecturer at South Downs College, prior to leaving the UK, to reside in the province of Valencia in Spain. He moved to a remote hamlet in Spain in 2003, and his geographical distance coupled with a lack of access to the Spanish telephony network has seen him out of contact with his musical peers until recently. Being denied access for five years to the internet, to land lines, and to mobile phones saw him readily re-embrace the internet with his renewing contact with the wider world by means of his aubreysolidgroove and allenalien pages on MySpace, as well as the Aubreys Chicago acid house group forum on Facebook. ==See also== *Tech house == References  * Discogs.com entry Category:British people of Iranian descent Category:People from Portsmouth Category:British dance musicians Category:British house musicians Category:British techno musicians Category:Remixers Category:British DJs Category:Club DJs Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Electronic dance music DJs Category:British record producers ","title":"Aubrey (producer)"},{"id":"2221969","text":"RG-58/U is a type of coaxial cable often used for low-power signal and RF connections.

The detainee's hands and feet are shackled to a bolt in the floor in front of the white plastic chair.Guant√°namo Prisoners Getting Their Day, but Hardly in Court, The New York Times, November 11, 2004 - mirror Inside the Guant√°namo Bay hearings: Barbarian \\"Justice\\" dispensed by KGB-style \\"military tribunals\\", Financial Times, December 11, 2004 Three chairs were reserved for members of the press, but only 37 of the 574 Tribunals were observed. The Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRT) were a set of tribunals for confirming whether detainees held by the United States at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp had been correctly designated as \\"enemy combatants\\". The CSRTs were established July 7, 2004 by order of U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul WolfowitzDepartment of Defense: Order Establishing Combatant Status Review Tribunals (PDF), signed by Paul Wolfowitz. See also News Release by Department of Defense Public Affairs Office. after U.S. Supreme Court rulings in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld and Rasul v. Bushs:Combatant Status Review Tribunal (fact sheet of October 17, 2006) and were coordinated through the Office for the Administrative Review of the Detention of Enemy Combatants. These non-public hearings were conducted as \\"a formal review of all the information related to a detainee to determine whether each person meets the criteria to be designated as an enemy combatant.\\" The first CSRT hearings began in July 2004. Redacted transcripts of hearings for \\"high value detainees\\" were posted to the Department of Defense (DoD) website. As of October 30, 2007, fourteen CSRT transcripts were available on the DoD website. The Supreme Court of the United States found these tribunals to be unconstitutional in Boumediene v. Bush. ==Existing U.S. and the Combat Status Review Tribunals== The CSRTs are not bound by the rules of evidence that would apply in court, and the government's evidence is presumed to be \\"genuine and accurate.\\" The government is required to present all of its relevant evidence, including evidence that tends to negate the detainee's designation, to the tribunal. Unclassified summaries of relevant evidence may be provided to the detainee. The detainee's personal representative may view classified information and comment on it to the tribunal to aid in its determination but does not act as an advocate for the detainee. If the tribunal determines that the preponderance of the evidence is insufficient to support a continued designation as \\"enemy combatant\\" and its recommendation is approved through the chain of command established for that purpose, the detainee will be informed of that decision upon finalization of transportation arrangements (or earlier, if the task force commander deems it appropriate). The rules do not give a timetable for informing detainees in the event that the tribunal has decided to retain their enemy combatant designations. Article 5 creates a particularized limited process, intended to sort individuals when any doubt exists as to their status. The sole question for determination is whether the captive meets the definition of POW in Article 4 of the Prisoner of War Convention. Secretary of the Navy Gordon R. England stated: Thus, the tribunals themselves are modeled after the procedures‚ÄîAR 190-8 Tribunals‚Äîthe military uses to make determinations in compliance with the Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention (that states \\"Should any doubt arise as to whether persons, having committed a belligerent act and having fallen into the hands of the enemy, belong to any of the categories enumerated in Article 4, such persons shall enjoy the protection of the present Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.\\") This is most likely because, in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, a plurality of the Supreme Court suggested the Department of Defense empanel tribunals similar to the AR 190 to make factual status determinations. The mandate of the CSRTs and the AR 190-8 Tribunals differed in that AR 190-8 Tribunals were authorized to determine that captives were civilians, who should be released, and \\"lawful combatants\\", whom the Geneva Conventions protect from prosecution. ===Conduct of Combatant Status Review Tribunals=== CSRT notice being read to a Guantanamo captive The exact location of the current CSRT hearings is unknown, but prior CSRT hearings were held in trailers in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Images of the trailers, with the white, plastic chairs the detainees sat in shackled to the floor and the large, black leather chair behind a microphone where the President sat can be found on the DoD website. ===Presiding officers=== The identity of the presiding officers at CSRTs hearings is classified. In the CSRT transcripts released on the DoD website, that information has been removed from the transcripts. The ranks of those present, however, and their service branch remain in the documents. For example, at Guleed Hassan Ahmed's CSRT in April 2007, the CSRT President was a Lieutenant Colonel from the U.S. Air Force. Other services present include the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army; the only other rank mentioned in the transcript was Gunnery Sergeant. In other CSRTs, the ranks, services, and persons present varied. At certain CSRTs, a non-military language analyst was present. ===Role of the CSRT Recorder=== The CSRT Recorder had several tasks. First, he or she was charged with keeping a record of the CSRT process by recording the CSRT process. Second, the Recorder swore in all the CSRT participants by administering an oath. Third, the Recorder was also charged with presenting classified and unclassified material during the CSRTs. Fourth, the Recorder was often asked to explain or clarify facts or information during the CSRT. In Guleed Hassan Ahmed's CSRT transcript one finds the following exchange: > PRESIDENT:[The]Tribunal has completed its review of the unclassified > evidence provided. We do have one question for the Recorder. Is Somalia, > Ethiopia, and/or Kenya a coalition partner? > RECORDER: Somalia is not; Ethiopia is; and Kenya is, a coalition partner of > the United States. ===Role of the Detainee at CSRTs=== Detainees had the option of attending their CSRTs, but attendance was not mandated. Some detainees protested the CSRTs by not attending, opting instead to send personal, written statements to be read before the CSRT in their absence. The reading of a detainee's written statement was the task of The Personal Representative, and this occurred, in one case, with Guleed Hassan Ahmed who did not attend his CSRT and instead sent a statement. When detainees did attend, if required, a translator was typically present to assist the detainee and tribunal members.National Public Radio, A Government Lawyer's Take on Gitmo, November 1, 2007 They are given a copy of the unclassified summary of information, and aided by a \\"Personal Representative\\". ===Presence of observers at CSRTs=== The question of the presence of outside, neutral observers at the CSRTs is debated. ===Murat Kurnaz, an example=== Murat Kurnaz is a young Turkish citizen who was born in, and had grown up, in Germany. When captured, he was close to being granted German citizenship, which children of guest workers are required to apply for in a separate process when they come of age. While on a trip to Pakistan in the fall of 2001, he was taken off a tourist bus and detained, then transferred to United States custody. When his case was reviewed by a CSRT in the fall of 2004, the tribunal's determined there was enough evidence that Kurnaz had ties to terrorism to classify and hold him as an enemy combatant. Through a bureaucratic slip-up, Kurnaz's file was declassified. During the brief window when it was declassified in March 2005, the Washington Post reviewed all the evidence against him and published a summary. Joyce Hens Green, a US District Court judge for the District of Columbia, was assigned in 2004 to coordinate the nearly 60 habeas corpus cases filed following the US Supreme Court's decision in Rasul v. Bush (2004) that detainees had the right to due process and to habeas corpus challenges of their detention. Kurnaz' case was one which she reviewed, and she had the clearance to review both the classified and declassified materials. Green found that Kurnaz' file contained some 100 pages of documents and reports explaining that German and American investigators could find no evidence whatsoever that Kurnaz had any ties to terrorism. Shortly before his tribunal an unsigned memo had been added to his file concluding he was an al Qaeda member. Green's comment on the memo was that it: Green stated that Kurnaz' case was an \\"extreme example of illegal detention\\" at Guantanamo. Eugene R. Fidell, a Washington-based expert in military law, said: ==Critics== Principal arguments of why these tribunals are inadequate to warrant acceptance as \\"competent tribunal\\" are: * The CSRT conducted rudimentary proceedings * The CSRT afforded detainees few basic protections * Many detainees lacked counsel * The CSRT also informed detainees only of general charges against them, while the details on which the CSRT premised enemy combatant status decisions were classified. * Detainees had no right to present witnesses or to cross-examine government witnesses. Some specific cases that call attention to what critics assert is a flawed nature of the CSRT procedure: Mustafa Ait Idir, Moazzam Begg, Murat Kurnaz, Feroz Abbasi, and Martin Mubanga. \\"Judge Rules Detainee Tribunals Illegal\\", The Washington Post, February 1, 2005; pg. A01 :Ian Herbert and Ben Russell \\"'The Americans are Breaking International Law... It is a Society Heading Towards Animal Farm' - Archbishop Sentamu on Guantanamo\\" , The Independent, February 18, 2006 original James Crisfield, the legal advisor to the Tribunals, offered his legal opinion, that CSRT > do not have the discretion to determine that a detainee should be classified > as a prisoner of war -- only whether the detainee satisfies the definition > of \\"enemy combatant\\" Determining whether a captive should be classified as a prisoner of war is the purpose of a \\"competent tribunal\\". On June 29, 2006, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the Geneva Conventions should be applied, but only Article 3, which does not require a competent tribunal.Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, Supreme Court Syllabus, pg. 4, point 4. ==Results== Specific Combatant Status Review Tribunal hearings have resulted in a variety of outcomes. Many detainees are still being detained, others have been released to return to their homeland, and still others have been classified and cleared for release but remain at Guantanamo Bay and in U.S. custody because their home countries cannot assure their safety. According to the prior Secretary of the Navy Gordon England, > The basis of detaining captured enemy combatants is not to punish but, > rather, to prevent them from continuing to fight against the United States > and its coalition partners in the ongoing global war on terrorism. Detention > of captured enemy combatants is both allowed and accepted under > international law of armed conflict. ==2007 Combatant Status Review Tribunals for 14 \\"high-value detainees\\"== In a surprise move President George W. Bush announced the transfer of 14 \\"high- value detainees\\" from clandestine CIA custody to military custody in Guantanamo in the fall of 2006. Prior to the transfer legal critics had repeatedly stated that the men in covert CIA custody could never be tried because they had been subjected to abusive interrogation techniques, which would invalidate any evidence that flowed from their interrogations. Nevertheless, Bush said the transfer would allow the men, most of whom were considered to be members of the inner circle of al Qaeda's senior leadership, to be tried at Guantanamo Bay using the CSRT procedures. ==U.S. Judicial appeals== The Bush Presidency asserted that the captives had no right to appeal and that they were outside the US judicial systems. Captives who had \\"next friends\\" willing to initiate the habeas corpus process filed appeals before US District Courts. Rasul v. Bush (2004) was the first appeal to make its way to the Supreme Court of the United States. The court ruled that detainees had the right to challenge the basis of their detention, and that the government needed to distinguish between POWs, civilians, and enemy combatants. To respond to the Court's ruling, the Bush administration established the Combatant Status Review Tribunals to review whether detainees were properly classified as enemy combatants and began reviews in 2004. It was not until they had determined if a detainee was an enemy combatant that they could proceed to trials by military commissions. In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006), the Court ruled that the system of military commissions as established by the DoD was illegal and needed to be replaced by a system authorized by Congress. Through the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and the Military Commissions Act of 2006, in accordance with Bush administration goals, the United States Congress moved to limit, and then curtail the detainees' ability to file habeas corpus appeals. The Supreme Court ruled on the outstanding habeas corpus appeals in Al Odah v. United States and Boumediene v. Bush (2008), discussed below. The Military Commission Act provides a process by which captives can appeal the decisions of the Combatant Status Review Tribunal and whether it properly followed OARDEC's rules in reaching its determination. If and when captives are able to file these appeals, they would be heard before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Emma Schwartz, in the US News and World Report, on August 30, 2007, reported that her sources told her: \\"...Up to one fourth of the department's own civil appellate staff has recently opted out of handling the government's cases against detainee appeals.\\" Several amalgamated cases have been initiated in the DC Circuit Court. There is controversy over whether the Appeal Court will have access to all of the evidence against the captives. As of May 2008, none of the cases have proceeded to the point when the judges would consider the merits of the case. ==Witnesses requested by detainees== Detainees in extrajudicial detention in the United States Guantanamo Bay detainment camps in Cuba were initially not provided with any mechanism with which to challenge the allegations that kept them detained. Lawyers who volunteered to represent the detainees challenged various aspects of the legal basis of the Bush and Obama administrationss policy on detainees in the war on terror. As a result of Rasul v. Bush, the US Supreme Court ruled that detainees needed to be provided with a mechanism whereby they could challenge the laws that kept them in detention. In July 2004 the Department of Defense responded by instituting Combatant Status Review Tribunals. Detainees were allowed to request witnesses. The Presidents of the Tribunals had the authority to rule whether those witnesses would be \\"relevant.\\" If the president ruled a witness relevant, the Tribunals officers were to undertake good faith efforts to find the witnesses. ===Selected witness requests=== {  + Witnesses ruled \\"not reasonably available\\" -  Witness  Requested by  Notes -  Shahzada Masoud  * Abdullah Mujahid  * Mujahid asserted that he had been promoted to traffic commissioner, and requested the members of the commission who visited him and recommended his promotion. * Advisor to Afghan President Hamid Karzai on tribal affairs, and leader of the commission that recommended Mujahid's promotion.Guantanamo Bay detainees not given access to witnesses despite availability , The Jurist, June 18, 2006Detainees not given access to witnesses: But in one case, 3 quickly found, Boston Globe, June 18, 2006Found: The 'unfindable' men , Mail and Guardian, July 1, 2006 } ==Supreme Court 2008 ruling== On June 12, 2008 the Supreme Court ruled in the case Boumediene v.

Though legends vary, all agree that a Scota was the ancestor of the Gaels, who traced their ancestry to Irish invaders, called Scotti, who settled in Argyll and Caledonia, regions which later came to be known as Scotland after their founder. ==Early sources== Edward J. Cowan traced the first mention of Scota in literature to the 12th century.Myth and Identity in Early Medieval Scotland, EJ Cowan, Scottish Historical Review lxiii, No. 176 (Oct. 1984) pp.111‚Äì35. Scota appears in the Irish chronicle Book of Leinster (containing a redaction of the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn). However, a text found in the 11th-century Historia Brittonum contains an earlier reference to Scota.The Irish identity of the kingdom of the Scots in the 12th and 13th centuries, Dauvit Broun, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 1999, p. 78. 12th-century sources state that Scota was the daughter of an Egyptian pharaoh, a contemporary of Moses, who married Geytholos (Go√≠del Glas), the founder of the Scots and Gaels after being exiled from Egypt.W. Matthews, \\"The Egyptians in Scotland: the Political History of a Myth\\", Viator 1 (1970), pp.289‚Äì306. The earliest Scottish sources claim Geytholos was a king of Greece, Neolus or Heolaus, while the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn describes him as a Scythian. Other manuscripts of the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn contain a variant legend where M√≠l Esp√°ine appears as Scota's husband, and connects him to ancient Iberia.A dictionary of Celtic mythology, James MacKillop, Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 330. A variant myth in the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn states that there was another Scota. She was the daughter of an Egyptian pharaoh named Cingris, a name found only in Irish legend. She married Niul, son of F√©nius Farsaid. Niul was a Babylonian who traveled to Scythia after the collapse of the Tower of Babel. He was a scholar of languages and was invited by the Pharaoh to Egypt to take Scota's hand in marriage. Scota and Nuil had a son, Go√≠del Glas, the eponymous ancestor of the Gaels, who created the Gaelic language by combining the best features of the 72 languages then in existence. ==Scota and the Stone of Scone== Baldred Bisset is credited with being the first to connect the Stone of Scone with the Scota foundation legends in his 1301 work Processus, putting forward an argument that Scotland, not Ireland, was where the original Scota homeland lay.The Irish identity of the kingdom of the Scots in the 12th and 13th centuries, Dauvit Broun, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 1999, p. 120. Bisset wanted to legitimize a Scottish (as opposed to English) accession to the throne when Alexander III of Scotland died in 1286. At his coronation in 1249, Alexander himself heard his royal genealogy recited generations back to Scota. Bisset attempted to legitimize a Scottish accession by highlighting Scota's importance as the transporter of the Stone of Scone from Egypt during the exodus of Moses to Scotland. In 1296, the Stone was captured by Edward I of England and taken to Westminster Abbey. In 1323, Robert the Bruce used Bisset's legend connecting Scota to the Stone in an attempt to return it to Scone Abbey in Scotland.Reading the medieval in early modern England, Gordon McMullan, David Matthews, Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 109. The 15th- century English chronicler John Hardyng later attempted to debunk Bisset's claims.Glastonbury Abbey and the Arthurian tradition, James P. Carley, Boydell & Brewer, 2001, p. 275 ff. ==Later sources== Andrew of Wyntoun's Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland and John of Fordun's Chronica Gentis Scotorum (1385) are sources of the Scota legends, alongside Thomas Grey's Scalacronica (1362). Hector Boece's 16th-century Historia Gentis Scotorum (\\"History of the Scottish People\\") also mentions the Scota foundation myth. Walter Bower's 15th-century Scotichronicon included the first illustrations of the legends. ==Grave of Scota== Signpost on by-road, south of Tralee The grave of Scota (or Scotia's Grave) allegedly lies in a valley south of Tralee Town, Co. Kerry, Ireland. The area is known as Glenn Scoithin, \\"Vale of the Little Flower\\", but is more popularly referred to as Foley's Glen (Foley's Glen). A trail from the road leads along a stream to a clearing where a circle of large stones marks the grave site, as indicated by a County Council signpost. ==Sources== *Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn *Geoffrey Keating, Forus Feasa ar √âirinn * Seumas MacManus, The Story of the Irish Race (February 1970 The Devin-Adair Company New York) * Seumas MacManus, The Story of the Irish Race (1990 edition printed by Wings Books) * Michael O'Clery, Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland (1616‚Äì1636 Donegal) * Benedict Fitzpatrick's (1901‚Äì1963) \\"Ireland and the Foundations of Europe\\" ==See also== * Scotia's Grave * Scotia ==References== Category:Legendary Irish people Category:Scottish mythology Category:British traditional history Category:Legendary Scottish people ","title":"Scota"},{"id":"2221985","text":"The Rambler Channel Bridge is a quadruple-track railway bridge in Hong Kong. It carries the MTR's Airport Express and Tung Chung Line over the Rambler Channel, linking Tsing Yi Station and Lai King Station. ==History== In 1994, the Mass Transit Railway Corporation awarded the contract to design and construct the bridge to Dragages et Travaux Publics, in partnership with Penta-Ocean Construction. The contract was worth $490 million. The bridge was designed by Bouygues Travaux Publics. Construction began in October 1995. It was structurally completed in February 1997. The bridge began carrying revenue passengers with the opening of the Tung Chung Line on 21 June 1998. ===1996 construction accident=== Six construction workers were killed when a metal work platform collapsed on 6 June 1996. The platform, which held four men, plunged 20 metres and crushed two workers below. The men were rushed to Yan Chai Hospital in nearby Tsuen Wan and declared dead shortly after arrival at 6:00 pm. Those killed were engineer Tam Wai-shing, 40; Yeung Sung-po, 50; Shek Shing, 58; Wong Kam-wo, 30; and brothers-in-law Law Tai-yau, 36, and Cheng Chi-ming, 33. The Labour Department launched an investigation to determine the cause of the accident. It was aided by specialists from the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department and the Buildings Department. Construction of the bridge was temporarily halted and the Labour Department inspected all similar work platforms across the territory. The tragedy was blamed on the wrong type of bolt being used to affix the work platform to a concrete pillar. A Coroner's Court inquest before coroner David Thomas heard that the anchor bolts were only half the length required, were designed to hold electric cables, and were screwed into plastic sockets. The platform collapsed after two of the bolts detached. The weight on the platform exceeded four tonnes, or three times more than the bolts could support. On 4 December 1996 the Labour Department issued summonses to Dragages et Travaux Publics; its manager, Didier Noel; and subcontractor Takamura Limited (which built the platform), under charges of breaching general duties provisions under the Factory and Industrial Undertakings Ordinance. Dragages was accused of not providing sufficient training to workers, and failing to ensure the safety of the platform. A representative for Takamura argued against prosecuting the company as it was only responsible for installing the platform. Dragages et Travaux Publics was found solely responsible for the collapse. The company was fined HK$105,000 on 8 August 1997 after admitting to three charges of failing to ensure safety and failing to maintain properly built scaffolding. In October 1997 Takamura Limited (also known as Pacific Island Consultants) was cleared of responsibility for the accident. The tragedy was the single greatest loss of life during the Airport Core Programme. ==Description== The bridge is 1,100 metres long. It is made up of precast concrete segments lowered into place by a launching gantry. The bilevel main deck segments are eight metres high and weigh 120 tonnes each. The segments are held together with epoxy glue and high-strength steel tendons. ==References * Category:Tsing Yi Category:Railway bridges in Hong Kong Category:MTR Category:1996 industrial disasters ","title":"Rambler Channel Bridge (railway bridge)"},{"id":"2221988","text":"Super Buddies are a team of comic book superheroes in the DC Comics universe who appeared in the six-issue Formerly Known as the Justice League miniseries in 2003, and its 2005 sequel, I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League (published in JLA Classified). The team was put together by former Justice League bank roller Maxwell Lord as a superhero team \\"accessible to the common man\\". The team is considered more or less inept and incapable of being of any help by many (including the actual Justice League). The team was created by writers Keith Giffen and J. M. DeMatteis, and artists Kevin Maguire and Joe Rubinstein. Giffen, DeMatteis, and Maguire had previously created the tongue- in-cheek Justice League International comic book in the 1990s, and revived a similar style of comedy as that series featured. ==Formerly Known as the Justice League== Most of the Super Buddies recruited by Maxwell Lord and his robot sidekick L-Ron were former members of Justice League International when Giffen, DeMatteis, and Maguire worked on the series: Blue Beetle, Booster Gold, Fire, Ralph Dibny (The Elongated Man) and his wife Sue, and Captain Atom. A seventh former member, Captain Marvel, was recruited by L-Ron, but he turned down the offer. His sister, Mary Marvel, joined in his place. The Super Buddies do not and cannot get along: Blue Beetle and Booster Gold, formerly the self-proclaimed \\"Abbott and Costello\\" of the JLI, now find themselves constantly arguing and fruitlessly attempting to prove to one another that they have matured. No one takes Booster or Ralph Dibny seriously, though not without good reason. Fire runs a website, \\"blazingfire.com\\", where she makes sensual pictures of herself available for (paid) download, and cannot get along with the polite and innocent Mary Marvel, whom Fire dubs \\"Mary Poppins\\". In addition, Fire convinces Sue that Ralph rates as \\"a four\\" (out of ten), giving Ralph an inferiority complex as a result. Captain Atom has no idea why he even joined the team, and is constantly tense and frustrated around the others. To top it all off, Maxwell Lord plans to fully exploit his employees' images; he sets their headquarters up in a Queens, New York strip mall storefront, making the team available for contact through a 1-800 number and producing a Super Friends-esque television commercial for the Super Buddies. This new team successfully defeats the E-Street Bloodsuckers, a gang of Harvard drop-out super-powered hoodlums, thanks to a well-timed slap from Mary. The Super Buddies are then kidnapped during their first team meeting by Roulette, who brainwashes them into serving as gladiators in her intergalactic metahuman arena. Mary Marvel and Captain Atom are pitted against each other, and the mind-controlled Mary nearly beats Atom and Fire to death before she overcomes her programming and the team is released from captivity. While Beetle and Booster rush a seriously injured (and radioactively leaking) Captain Atom to a hospital, the others find that Manga Khan, L-Ron's former master, has come to Earth to reclaim the robot. Khan offers to trade G'nort, another former JLI member, for possession of L-Ron, but when this offer is refused, and Booster accidentally knocks over several rows of Khan's sentries, Khan declares war on Earth. Only by the intervention of the real Justice League (who have been spying on the Super Buddies all this time in anticipation of such a faux pas) is an intergalactic crisis avoided. Formerly Known as the Justice League proved a popular miniseries, and won the 2004 Eisner Award for Best Comedy Series. ==I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League== Booster Gold and Blue Beetle work at the (literal) fast-food restaurant from Hell, in JLA Classified #6, which included the third installment of the six-part miniseries I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League. A six-issue sequel to Formerly Known as the Justice League, I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League, was produced by Giffen, DeMatteis, and Maguire in 2004, but its publication was held off until 2005, after DC's Identity Crisis, in which a pregnant Sue Dibny is killed, had run its course. There is a running gag in the miniseries involving whether or not Sue is pregnant. I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League, published in JLA Classified #4-9, finds the Super Buddies settling into their roles as superheroes for hire. The Elongated Man is bragging about Sue allegedly being pregnant, when she is, in fact, not pregnant. Fire and Mary Batson (Mary Marvel's alter ego) become roommates, much to the distaste of Mary's brother Billy Batson (a.k.a. Captain Marvel). Captain Atom has quit the team because of the incident with Mary from the previous miniseries and sued Maxwell Lord, leading him to attempt to recruit both Power Girl and Guy Gardner to join the team. Gardner causes several problems of his own: he is opening a bar next door to the Super Buddies' strip mall headquarters, and he takes delight in sexually harassing Fire, Sue, Power Girl, and Mary Marvel. While visiting the Justice Society of America headquarters, Booster Gold begins messing around with Doctor Fate's talisman and inadvertently wishes the team to Hell. From the depths of Hell, Fire calls Sue for help (on her cell phone, which is then accidentally destroyed), and Power Girl and Guy Gardner are recruited to follow the team to Hell and save them. While in Hell, the Super Buddies work at a labyrinthine version of Big Belly Burger called \\"Beelze Burger\\". The demons use Mary Batson as a hostage, since her magic word ‚Äî \\"Shazam!\\" ‚Äî does not work in Hell (since the wizard Shazam himself is not present in that plane of existence). Ralph uses his stretching abilities to help foil the demons' plan to torture the Buddies. To the amazement of both Fire and Gardner, the Super Buddies discover Ice, another former JLI member, among the denizens of Hell. Sickened by Fire and Gardner's displays of sorrow, the demons free the group, allowing them to take Ice with them as long as they do not look back on their way out. Fire accidentally looks back, and Ice is snatched back to the afterlife. It is implied that Ice will be sent to Valhalla. The group makes its way out of Hell, but soon find themselves trapped in an alternate universe populated by a team of sinister versions of themselves and their fellow heroes called the \\"Power Posse\\". This team is a group-for-hire who operated out of a strip club owned by a sleazy, or sleazier, version of Maxwell Lord and his moll, a degraded and somewhat dimwitted version of Sue Dibny. The Power Posse consisted of a giant-sized G'nort who began a destructive rampage, sado- masochistic incestuous versions of Captain Marvel (who talked with a lisp) and Mary Marvel, who called herself Mistress Mary, a murderous Ice, now a stripper using the name Tiffany, an even stupider version of Booster working as a bartender, and bouncer Metamorpho. The Fire of this universe had been killed by Tiffany and Sue had divorced Ralph. Doctor Fate finally brings the team back to their correct dimension after they have to do battle with doppelg√§ngers of themselves. Most of the battle takes place on the hairy, insect-infested body of G'nort himself. ==Infinite Crisis== It was revealed in the eighty-page one shot Countdown to Infinite Crisis (2005) that Maxwell Lord was in fact Checkmate's latest Black King, and had been collecting information on the Justice League members' weaknesses so that he could annihilate them. Blue Beetle had broken into Lord's secret headquarters and discovered his secret, but was murdered by Lord before he could warn anyone. In The OMAC Project #5, the remnants of the Super Buddies (Mary Marvel included) are shown trying to avenge the Blue Beetle's murder, with no success. ==References== Category:2003 in comics Category:Characters created by Keith Giffen Category:Comics by J.

It lived in what is now Antarctica, India, China, Mongolia, European Russia and South Africa. Four to six species are currently recognized, although from the 1930s to 1970s the number of species was thought to be much higher. They ranged in size from that of a small dog to 2.5 meters long. Being a dicynodont, Lystrosaurus had only two teeth (a pair of tusk-like canines), and is thought to have had a horny beak that was used for biting off pieces of vegetation. Lystrosaurus was a heavily built, herbivorous animal, approximately the size of a pig. The structure of its shoulders and hip joints suggests that Lystrosaurus moved with a semi-sprawling gait. The forelimbs were even more robust than the hindlimbs, and the animal is thought to have been a powerful digger that nested in burrows. Lystrosaurus survived the Permian-Triassic extinction, 252 million years ago. In the Early Triassic, they were by far the most common terrestrial vertebrates, accounting for as many as 95% of the total individuals in some fossil beds. Researchers have offered various hypotheses for why Lystrosaurus survived the extinction event and prospered in the early Triassic. ==Description== Size of Lystrosaurus murrayi relative to a human. Lystrosaurus was a dicynodont therapsid, between long with an average of about depending upon the species. Unlike other therapsids, dicynodonts had very short snouts and no teeth except for the tusk-like upper canines. Dicynodonts are generally thought to have had horny beaks like those of turtles, for shearing off pieces of vegetation, which were then ground on a horny secondary palate when the mouth was shut. The jaw joint was weak and moved backwards and forwards with a shearing action, instead of the more common sideways or up and down movements. It is thought that the jaw muscles were attached unusually far forward on the skull and took up a lot of space on the top and back of the skull. As a result, the eyes were set high and well forward on the skull, and the face was short. Features of the skeleton indicate that Lystrosaurus moved with a semi-sprawling gait. The lower rear corner of the scapula (shoulder blade) was strongly ossified (built of strong bone), which suggests that movement of the scapula contributed to the stride length of the forelimbs and reduced the sideways flexing of the body. The five sacral vertebrae were massive but not fused to each other and to the pelvis, making the back more rigid and reducing sideways flexing while the animal was walking. Therapsids with fewer than five sacral vertebrae are thought to have had sprawling limbs, like those of modern lizards. In dinosaurs and mammals, which have erect limbs, the sacral vertebrae are fused to each other and to the pelvis. A buttress above each acetabulum (hip socket) is thought to have prevented dislocation of the femur (thigh bone) while Lystrosaurus was walking with a semi-sprawling gait. The forelimbs of Lystrosaurus were massive, and Lystrosaurus is thought to have been a powerful burrower. ==Distribution and species== Lystrosaurus fossils have been found in many Late Permian and Early Triassic terrestrial bone beds, most abundantly in Africa, and to a lesser extent in parts of what are now India, China, Mongolia, European Russia, and Antarctica (which was not over the South Pole at the time). ===Species found in Africa=== Lystrosaurus murrayi Most Lystrosaurus fossils have been found in the Balfour and Katberg Formations of the Karoo basin in South Africa; these specimens offer the best prospects of identifying species because they are the most numerous and have been studied for the longest time. As so often with fossils, there is debate in the paleontological community as to exactly how many species have been found in the Karoo basin. Studies from the 1930s to 1970s suggested a large number (23 in one case). Full version online at However, by the 1980s and 1990s, only six species were recognized in the Karoo: L. curvatus, L. platyceps, L. oviceps, L. maccaigi, L. murrayi, and L. declivis. A study in 2011 reduced that number to four, treating the fossils previously labeled as L. platyceps and L. oviceps as members of L. curvatus. L. maccaigi is the largest and apparently most specialized species, while L. curvatus was the least specialized. A Lystrosaurus-like fossil, Kwazulusaurus shakai, has also been found in South Africa. Although not assigned to the same genus, K. shakai is very similar to L. curvatus. Some paleontologists have therefore proposed that K. shakai was possibly an ancestor of or closely related to the ancestors of L. curvatus, while L. maccaigi arose from a different lineage. L. maccaigi is found only in sediments from the Permian period, and apparently did not survive the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event. Its specialized features and sudden appearance in the fossil record without an obvious ancestor may indicate that it immigrated into the Karoo from an area in which Late Permian sediments have not been found. L. curvatus is found in a relatively narrow band of sediments from shortly before and after the extinction, and can be used as an approximate marker for the boundary between the Permian and Triassic periods. A skull identified as L. curvatus has been found in late Permian sediments from Zambia. For many years it had been thought that there were no Permian specimens of L. curvatus in the Karoo, which led to suggestions that L. curvatus immigrated from Zambia into the Karoo. However, a re-examination of Permian specimens in the Karoo has identified some as L. curvatus, and there is no need to assume immigration. L. murrayi and L. declivis are found only in Triassic sediments. Lystrosaurus georgi ===Other species=== Lystrosaurus georgi fossils have been found in the Earliest Triassic sediments of the Moscow Basin in Russia. It was probably closely related to the African Lystrosaurus curvatus, which is regarded as one of the least specialized species and has been found in very Late Permian and very Early Triassic sediments. == Fossil history == thumb350pxDistribution of four Permian and Triassic fossil groups used as biogeographic evidence for continental drift, and land bridging. Location of Lystrosaurus remains shown by yellow circles Dr. Elias Root Beadle, a Philadelphia missionary and avid fossil collector, discovered the first Lystrosaurus skull. Beadle wrote to the eminent paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, but received no reply. Marsh's rival, Edward Drinker Cope, was very interested in seeing the find, and described and named Lystrosaurus in the Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society in 1870. Its name is derived from the Ancient Greek words listron \\"shovel\\" and sauros \\"lizard\\". Marsh belatedly purchased the skull in May 1871, although his interest in an already-described specimen was unclear; he may have wanted to carefully scrutinize Cope's description and illustration. === Plate tectonics === The discovery of Lystrosaurus fossils at Coalsack Bluff in the Transantarctic Mountains by Edwin H. Colbert and his team in 1969‚Äì70 helped support the hypothesis of plate tectonics and strengthen the theory, since Lystrosaurus had already been found in the lower Triassic of southern Africa as well as in India and China.Naomi Lubick, Investigating the Antarctic, Geotimes, 2005. ==PaleoecologyDominance of the Early Triassic=== Lystrosaurus is notable for dominating southern Pangaea for millions of years during the Early Triassic. At least one unidentified species of this genus survived the end-Permian mass extinction and, in the absence of predators and herbivorous competitors, went on to thrive and re- radiate into a number of species within the genus, becoming the most common group of terrestrial vertebrates during the Early Triassic; for a while, 95% of land vertebrates were Lystrosaurus. This is the only time that a single species or genus of land animal dominated the Earth to such a degree.BBC: Life Before Dinosaurs A few other Permian therapsid genera also survived the mass extinction and appear in Triassic rocks‚Äîthe therocephalians Tetracynodon, Moschorhinus and Ictidosuchoides‚Äîbut do not appear to have been abundant in the Triassic; complete ecological recovery took 30 million years, spanning the Early and Middle Triassic. Several attempts have been made to explain why Lystrosaurus survived the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event, the \\"mother of all mass extinctions\\", and why it dominated Early Triassic fauna to such an unprecedented extent: Lystrosaurus murrayi * Growth marks in fossilized tusks suggest that Lystrosaurus living in Antarctica ~250 Mya could enter a prolonged state of torpor analogous to hibernation. This could be the oldest evidence of a hibernation-like state in a vertebrate animal and indicates that torpor arose in vertebrates before mammals and dinosaurs evolved. 50px Text and images are available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. * One of the more recent theories is that the extinction event reduced the atmosphere's oxygen content and increased its carbon dioxide content, so that many terrestrial species died out because they found breathing too difficult. It has therefore been suggested that Lystrosaurus survived and became dominant because its burrowing life-style made it able to cope with an atmosphere of \\"stale air\\", and that specific features of its anatomy were part of this adaptation: a barrel chest that accommodated large lungs, short internal nostrils that facilitated rapid breathing, and high neural spines (projections on the dorsal side of the vertebrae) that gave greater leverage to the muscles that expanded and contracted its chest. However, there are weaknesses in all these points: the chest of Lystrosaurus was not significantly larger in proportion to its size than in other dicynodonts that became extinct; although Triassic dicynodonts appear to have had longer neural spines than their Permian counterparts, this feature may be related to posture, locomotion or even body size rather than respiratory efficiency; L. murrayi and L. declivis are much more abundant than other Early Triassic burrowers such as Procolophon or Thrinaxodon. Lystrosaurus skeletal diagram * The suggestion that Lystrosaurus was helped to survive and dominate by being semi-aquatic has a similar weakness: although temnospondyls become more abundant in the Karoo's Triassic sediments, they were much less numerous than L. murrayi and L. declivis. * The most specialized and the largest animals are at higher risk in mass extinctions; this may explain why the unspecialized L. curvatus survived while the larger and more specialized L. maccaigi perished along with all the other large Permian herbivores and carnivores. Although Lystrosaurus generally looks adapted to feed on plants similar to Dicroidium, which dominated the Early Triassic, the larger size of L. maccaigi may have forced it to rely on the larger members of the Glossopteris flora, which did not survive the end- Permian extinction. * Only the ‚Äìlong therocephalian Moschorhinus and the large archosauriform Proterosuchus appear large enough to have preyed on the Triassic Lystrosaurus species, and this shortage of predators may have been responsible for a Lystrosaurus population boom in the Early Triassic. * According to Benton, \\"Perhaps the survival of Lystrosaurus was simply a matter of luck\\". ==See also== * * ==References *Palaeos.com: Dicynodontia *Hugh Rance, The Present is the Key to the Past: \\"Mammal-like reptiles of Pangea\\" Category:Dicynodonts Category:Triassic synapsids Category:Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event Category:Prehistoric synapsids of Asia Category:Lopingian synapsids of Africa Category:Extinct animals of Antarctica Category:Triassic Antarctica Category:Taxa named by Edward Drinker Cope Category:Fossil taxa described in 1870 Category:Lopingian genus first appearances Category:Changhsingian genera Category:Induan genera Category:Early Triassic genus extinctions ","title":"Lystrosaurus"},{"id":"2221995","text":"86th Street is a station on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line of the New York City Subway, located at 86th Street and Fourth Avenue in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. It is served by the R train at all times. The 86th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line. Though it was originally planned to be a four- track express station with two island platforms, only the western platform and tracks were ultimately built. Construction on the segment of the line that includes 86th Street started in 1913, and was completed in 1915. The station opened on January 15, 1916, as part of an extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line from 59th Street to 86th Street. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1926-1927, and it was renovated in the 1970s and again in the late 2000s. The 86th Street station was renovated between 2018 and 2020, and elevators were added to make the station compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The 86th Street station serves as a bus hub and terminal for several New York City Transit bus routes. ==HistoryConstruction and opening=== The 86th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line. The plan for the line was initially adopted on June 1, 1905, before being approved by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York on June 18, 1906 after the Rapid Transit Commission was unable to get the necessary consents of property owners along the planned route. The Rapid Transit Commission was succeeded by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC) on July 1, 1907, and the PSC approved the plan for the line in October and November 1907. As part of negotiations between New York City and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company for the expansion of the city's transit network, the line was leased to a subsidiary of the BRT. The agreement, known as Contract 4 of the Dual Contracts, was signed on March 19, 1913. In 1912, during the Dual System negotiations, the construction of an extension of the Fourth Avenue subway from 43rd Street to 89th Street, just south of the 86th Street station, was recommended. This recommendation was approved by the Board of Estimate on February 15, 1912. The PSC directed its chief engineer to create plans on June 14, 1912. The two contracts for the extension, Route 11B, were awarded on September 16, 1912, to the Degnon Construction Company for a combined $3.8 million (equivalent to $ million in ). On January 24, 1913, construction began on Route 11B2, which includes this station and extends between 61st Street and 89th Street. Construction was completed on this section in 1915. 86th Street opened on January 15, 1916, as part of an extension of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line from 59th Street to 86th Street. The station was the original terminal for the line until a one-stop southward extension to Bay Ridge‚Äì95th Street opened on October 25, 1925. === Station renovations ===  1920s  On June 27, 1922, the New York State Transit Commission directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at 23 stations on the lines of the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), the successor to the BRT, to accommodate eight-car trains. As part of the project, Bay Ridge Avenue's platforms would have been lengthened from to . Progress on the extensions did not occur until February 16, 1925, when the New York City Board of Transportation (NYCBOT) directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at this and eleven other stations along the Fourth Avenue Line. It estimated the project's cost to be $633,000 () (). The BMT had been ordered by the Transit Commission to lengthen these platforms since September 1923. The NYCBOT received bids for the project on February 25, 1926. The contract was awarded to the Corson Construction Company for $345,021 () (). The extensions opened on August 1, 1927. Location of platform extension at 1970 at the southern end of the station  1960s  In the 1960s, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) started a project to lengthen station platforms on its lines in Southern Brooklyn to to accommodate 10-car trains. On July 14, 1967, the NYCTA awarded a contract to conduct test borings at eleven stations on the Fourth Avenue Line, including Bay Ridge Avenue, to the W. M. Walsh Corporation for $6,585 () in preparation of the construction of platform extensions (). The NYCTA issued an invitation for bids on the project to extend the platforms at stations along the Fourth Avenue Line between 45th Street station and Bay Ridge‚Äì95th Street, including this station, on May 3, 1968. However, work had already started on the platform extension project in February 1968. As part of the renovation project, the station's platform were extended to the south, and the station's elaborate mosaic tile walls were removed. The latter change, which was also made to 15 other stations on the BMT Broadway and Fourth Avenue Line, was criticized for being dehumanizing. The NYCTA spokesman stated that the old tiles were in poor condition. Furthermore, it did not consider the old mosaics to have \\"any great artistic merit\\". A view of the new wall tiling as an out-of-service R train passes through the station. 2010s In 2007, then-13th District Congressman Vito Fossella and 22nd District State Senator Marty Golden secured funding for an $13.8 million renovation, completed in 2011. The renovation repaired staircases, rebuilt the station's ventilation, and installed new tiling for walls and floors as well as ADA-compliant yellow safety treads along the platform edges. The platform walls were originally tiled, but removed during renovations in 1970. The modern renovation restored these tiles, and added an Arts for Transit glass mosaic inspired by the old homes of the Bay Ridge neighborhood.See: * * As part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)'s 2010‚Äì2014 Capital Program, funding was provided for a 25-station Station Renewal program, which focused on renovating stations with a high concentration of components rated 3.5 or worse on a five point scale, with 5 being the highest. 33% of components at this station were found to rate 3.5 or worse. In the 2010‚Äì2014 MTA Capital Program, funding was provided to design renovations to the station to make it fully compliant with accessibility guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as it was selected as the New York City Transportation Disabled Committee requested that the station substitute the 95th Street station as one of the 100 Key Stations required to be made ADA-accessble. Funding for the construction of the project was provided in the 2015‚Äì2019 MTA Capital Program. As part of the project, two elevators were added, one from the mezzanine to the platform and the other from the mezzanine to the street at the southeastern corner of 86th Street and Fourth Avenue. It was decided not to place the elevator at the station's 85th Street entrance since that entrance was not at the proper depth, and since that entrance was not manned. To provide adequate space for the sidewalk elevator, to allow for a widened staircase, and to work around sewers underneath the sidewalk, a sidewalk bulb-out was installed. The bulb-out also allows buses to stop without having to pull in and out of traffic. The decision to remove a lane from Fourth Avenue for the construction of the elevator was criticized by members of the local community board who believed that the change would be unsafe for pedestrians. To provide space for the elevator in the mezzanine, two staircases to the platform were relocated, with the elevator, and a new ramp leading to it, located in between them. In order to provide space for one of the new staircases to the platform, the station's longtime vendor lost its lease in February 2017. A second staircase was added from the mezzanine to the southwestern corner of Fourth Avenue and 86th Street as part of the project. Equipment and crew rooms in the mezzanine were reconfigured, including the installation of an ADA-compliant employee restroom and locker room, to accommodate mechanical and electrical infrastructure for the elevators. In addition, the station agent booth was modified to a wheelchair-friendly height, and railings, turnstiles, platform panels, Braille signage, and powered gates were reconfigured to provide full accessibility. New artwork and mosaic bands were also installed as part of the project. As part of the project, new maps were posted on station walls as a test. The station's communications systems were also upgraded as part of the project. The MTA released the contract for the project to prospective bidders in fall 2017. The $17.9 million contract for the project was awarded to El Sol Contracting in December 2017. Construction on the elevators started in June 2018 and was expected to be completed by the end of May 2020. However, because of resource shortages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, completion was pushed back to July 29, 2020. The final cost of the project was $36,055,077. ==Station layout== {table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=50G style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=100Street level style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=450Exit/entrance - style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"B1 style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"Mezzanine style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"Fare control, station agent - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" rowspan=3 valign=topB2 Platform level style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\"Northbound style=\\"border- top:solid 1px gray;\\"‚Üê toward ( late nights) () - style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border- bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2 - style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Southbound style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" toward (Terminus) ‚Üí } This underground station has two tracks and a single island platform. The R stops here at all times. The platform and mezzanines above have dark green columns, and alternate columns have the standard black station name plate with white lettering reading \\"86 Street\\". The track walls had their mosaic tiling restored as part of the station's 2011 renovation. The southern section of the station is where the platform was extended in 1970, and they have no mosaic trims or tiles along the wall, instead including an extension of the tunnel benchwall. The platform has several employee- facilities that have a mosaic trim line. ===Provisions=== The station is built on the west side of Fourth Avenue due to plans for a possible extension of the express tracks south of 59th Street. The platform is located between what would be the two southbound tracks as north of this station, the current southbound track swings out around the platform while the northbound one remains straight. The additional two tracks would have been built on the eastern side of Fourth Avenue. The four tracks were planned mainly to facilitate the Staten Island Tunnel, which would have necessitated express service, although the tunnel was never constructed. In addition, there are large portions of the mezzanines that are now used for employees only. View of the staircase at the southwestern corner of 86th Street and Fourth Avenue ===Exits=== This station has two entrances/exits. The full-time one is at the south end. Two staircases from the platform go up to a mezzanine that has a turnstile bank. A bodega was located within fare control until it was evicted in order to accommodate an elevator. Outside fare control, there is a token booth, and three staircases going up to either southern corner of 86th Street and Fourth Avenue, with two leading to the southwestern corner. An elevator leads to the southeastern corner of the intersection. The station's other fare control area is unstaffed. Two staircases from the platform, one of which is now closed, go up to a mezzanine that has two High Entry/Exit Turnstiles and a single staircase going up to the southwest corner of 85th Street and Fourth Avenue. Both mezzanines have their original mosaic trim line. == Bus stop == Signs in the mezzanine showing bus connections.

It is referred to in Romanian as The Western Plain (C√¢mpia de Vest). == Prehistoric culture == During the prehistoric era, the Great Hungarian Plain was a place of cultural and technological changes, as well as an important meeting point of cultures of Eastern and Western Europe. It is a region of great archaeological importance to major European cultural transitions. Agriculture began in the Great Hungarian Plain with the Early Neolithic K√∂r√∂s culture, located in present-day Serbia, 6.000-5.500 B.C.E. followed 5.500 B.C.E. by the Linear Pottery culture(LBK) which later became the dominant agricultural culture of Europe. The LBK was followed by the Lengyel culture in the Late Neolithic 5000-3400 BC. During the Early Bronze Age (2.800 - 1.800 BC), the growing demand for metal ores in Europe resulted in the new pan- European and intercontinental trade networks. During that period cultures of the Great Hungarian Plain incorporated many elements from the other cultures of Bronze Age Near Eastern, Steppe and Central Europe During the early Iron Age (first millennium BC), a variant of the Central European Hallstatt culture inhabited Transdanubia, while pre-Scythian and later Scythian cultures were found in the eastern region of the Great Hungarian Plain. == Genomic analysis of prehistoric populations == In 2014, a major study of DNA from burials in the Great Hungarian Plain was published. The 5,000-year record indicated significant genomic shifts at the beginning of the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages, with periods of stability in between. The earliest Neolithic genome was similar to other European hunter-gatherers and surprisingly there was no evidence of lactase persistence at that period. The most recent samples, from the Iron Age, showed an eastern genomic influence contemporary with introduced Steppe burial rites. There was also a transition towards lighter pigmentation. == See also == *Eurasian Steppe *Little Hungarian Plain *Pannonian Basin *Puszta *Steppe Route *Vienna Basin ==References External links == * *K√∂r√∂s Regional Archaeological Project: Neolithic and Copper Age archaeology in the Great Hungarian Plain Category:Eurasian Steppe Category:Historical regions in Hungary Category:Historical regions in the Kingdom of Hungary Category:Geography of Vojvodina Category:Plains of Croatia Category:Plains of Hungary Category:Plains of Romania Category:Plains of Serbia Category:Plains of Slovakia Category:Plains of Ukraine Category:Pannonian Plain ","title":"Great Hungarian Plain"},{"id":"2222004","text":"Roberto \\"Robbie\\" Rivera (born 1973) is a prolific house music producer and DJ born in Puerto Rico.

The northern segment of the highway (between Silverton and Woodburn) is known as the Hillsboro-Silverton Highway No. 140 (see Oregon highways and routes), a designation which continues north on OR 219, and the southern segment (southeast of Silverton) is known as the Silver Creek Falls Highway No. 163. ==Route description== Start of Oregon Route 214 The highway in Silver Falls State Park OR 214's northern terminus is at the junction with Interstate 5 and OR 219 in the city of Woodburn. (A single diamond interchange serves both OR 219 and OR 214 from the freeway; OR 219 leads west of the interchange and OR 214 heads east). The roadway heads due east into the city of Woodburn for about , skirting the northern edge of town (though passing through a very busy shopping district). It then intersects with both OR 99E and OR 211; OR 214 continues south from this intersection, sharing an alignment with OR 99E for , officially along the Pacific Highway East No. 1E. OR 214 then departs from OR 99E and heads southeast. Outside of Woodburn, OR 214 is a two-lane country road. The next town of note heading south is Mount Angel, followed by Silverton. In Silverton, OR 214 intersects with OR 213, which heads north to Molalla and south (southwest) to Salem. OR 214 continues southeast from Silverton, now as the Silver Falls Highway. The highway, almost immediately upon leaving the Silverton city limits, starts climbing into the Cascade foothills, until it enters Silver Falls State Park. Upon entering the park, the highway turns south, and provides several points of access to various park facilities and attractions. Upon leaving the park, the highway heads west towards the Salem area. It terminates near Aumsville at an interchange with OR 22. One significant alignment change occurred during the 90's. It used to be the case that OR 214, rather than having its northern terminus in Woodburn, instead continued west towards St. Paul, where it terminated at an intersection with OR 219 (which continued south to Salem on River Road). However, that section of OR 219 is no longer signed as a state route, and the section of OR 214 between St. Paul and Woodburn was renumbered as OR 219. Many maps (including Yahoo Maps) still show the old alignments of OR 219 and OR 214.

As a young man he firstly moved to Spoleto in Italy where he attended a military school, then to Buenos Aires where he became acquainted with the aviator Jorge Newbery who taught him how to fly. ==Aviation achievements== In 1912, Pettirossi received a scholarship from the Paraguayan government and moved to France where he obtained the title of aviator pilot from the international aeronautic federation. After receiving the title he made many important flights, one of which was a record eight-hour flight. He bought a Deperdussin model \\"T\\" monoplane with a 60 HP rotary Gnome engine. He made many famous and extraordinary acrobatic flights in Europe, South America and the United States. In December 1914 he founded the Aeroclub del Paraguay and served as its first president. ==Death, and legacy== On October 17, 1916, while doing an inverted loop, the left wing of his plane broke, and the aircraft crashed to the ground in a ranch owned by the Castell family, in Punta Lara, Buenos Aires Province. Pettirossi died instantly.

Wounded in the Civil War, he relocated to North Carolina afterward, where he became involved in Reconstruction activities. He served in the constitutional convention and later in the state legislature. A pioneer civil rights activist, he founded the National Citizens' Rights Association, and founded Bennett College as a normal school for freedmen in North Carolina (it has been a women's college since 1926). Known as an ally of African Americans, later in his career, Tourg√©e was asked to aid a committee in New Orleans to challenge segregation on railways in Louisiana, and he litigated what is known as the landmark Plessy v. Ferguson (1896). They were dismayed by the United States Supreme Court ruling that \\"separate but equal\\" public facilities were constitutional; this enabled segregation for decades. Historian Mark Elliott credits Tourg√©e with introducing the metaphor of \\"color-blind justice\\" into legal discourse.Elliott, Color Blind Justice.... ==Early life== Historical marker in front of Albion Tourg√©e's boyhood home near Kingsville, Ohio; marker placed in May 2015. Born in rural Williamsfield, Ohio, on May 2, 1838,Gross, Theodore. Albion W. Tourg√©e. Twayne Publishers, Inc., 1963: 13. Tourg√©e was the son of farmer Valentine Tourg√©e and his wife Louisa Emma Winegar. His mother died when he was five. He attended common schools in Ashtabula County and in Lee, Massachusetts, where he lived for two years with an uncle. Tourg√©e entered the University of Rochester in 1859. He showed no interest in politics until the university attempted to ban the Wide Awakes, a paramilitary campaign organization affiliated with the Republican Party. Tourg√©e took on the administration and succeeded in reaching a compromise with the University president.Olsen, A Carpetbagger's Crusade. Due to lack of funds, he had to leave the university in 1861, before completing his degree. He taught school to save money in order to return to Rochester. After the outbreak of the Civil War in April of the same year, Tourg√©e enlisted in the 27th New York Volunteer Infantry before completing his collegiate studies. Tourg√©e was awarded an A.B. degree in absentia in June 1862, as was a common practice at many universities for students who had enlisted before completing degrees.Toth, Margaret, \\"Albion Winegar Tourg√©e, '62,\\", University of Rochester Library Bulletin, Vol. III, Spring 1953, No. 3. ==Military service== left Fighting in the First Battle of Bull Run, the first major battle of the war, Tourg√©e was wounded in the spine when he was accidentally struck by a Union gun carriage during retreat. He suffered temporary paralysis and a permanent back problem that plagued him for the rest of his life. Upon recovering sufficiently to resume his military career, he was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the 105th Ohio Volunteer Infantry. At the Battle of Perryville, he was again wounded. On January 21, 1863, Tourg√©e was captured near Murfreesboro, Tennessee and was held as a prisoner-of-war in Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia, before his exchange on May 8, 1863. He rejoined Union forces and resumed his duties and fought at the battles of Chickamauga and Chattanooga. Under pressure from the military because of his medical condition, Tourg√©e resigned his commission on December 6, 1863. He returned to Ohio, where he married Emma Doiska Kilbourne, his childhood sweetheart. They had one child ==Reconstruction era== After the war, Tourg√©e studied law with an established firm, in an apprenticeship, and gained entrance to the Ohio bar. The Tourg√©e couple soon moved to Greensboro, North Carolina, where he could live in a warmer climate better suited to his war injuries. While there, he established himself as a lawyer, farmer, and editor, working for the Republican newspaper, the Union Registrar. In 1866, he attended the Convention of the Southern Loyalists, where he unsuccessfully attempted to push through a resolution for African-American suffrage.Michael Kent Curtis, ‚ÄúTourg√©e, Albion Winegar,‚Äù American National Biography Online, (2000), accessed September 1, 2011, http://www.anb.org/articles/04/04-00994.html. Considered by locals to be a carpetbagger because he had come from the North, Tourg√©e participated in several roles during Reconstruction. He drew from this period for later novels that he wrote about the time period. In 1868 he was elected to represent Guilford County at the state constitutional convention, which was dominated by Republicans. He successfully advocated for equal political and civil rights for all citizens; ending property qualifications for jury duty and officeholding; requiring popular election of all state officers, including judges; founding free public education; abolishing the use of whipping posts as punishment for persons convicted of crimes; judicial reform; and uniform taxation. But he learned that the new constitution was the first step to putting these reforms into practice. Tourg√©e was elected to the 7th District superior court as a judge, serving from 1868 to 1874. During this period he confronted the increasingly violent Ku Klux Klan, which was very powerful in his district and had members who repeatedly threatened his life. During this time, Tourg√©e was also appointed as one of three commissioners in charge of codifying North Carolina's previously dual law-code system into one. The new codified civil procedures, at first strongly opposed by the state's legal practitioners, proved in time the most flexible, and informal system in the Union.Olsen, A Carpetbagger's Crusade Among his other activities, Tourg√©e served as a delegate to the 1875 state constitutional convention and ran a losing campaign for Congress in 1878. ==Literary life== Albion's first literary endeavor was the novel Toinette, written between 1868 and 1869 while he was living in North Carolina. It was not published until 1874, and then under the pseudonym \\"Henry Churton.\\" It was renamed A Royal Gentleman when it was republished in 1881.Gross, Theodore. Albion W. Tourg√©e. Twayne Publishers, Inc., 1963: 35. Financial success came after his novel A Fool's Errand, by One of the Fools was published in late 1879. Based on his experiences of Reconstruction, the novel sold 200,000 copies. Its sequel, Bricks Without Straw (1880), also was a bestseller. It was unique among contemporary novels by white men about the South, as it presented events from the viewpoints of freedmen, and showed how the promises of freedom were narrowed by postwar violence and discrimination against the freedmen. In 1881, Tourg√©e and his family returned to the North, moving to Mayville, New York, near the Chautauqua Institution in the western part of the state. He made his living as writer and editor of the literary weekly The Continent, but it failed in 1884. He wrote many more novels and essays in the next two decades, many set in the Lake Erie region to which he had relocated. These included Button's Inn (1887), a novel about early Mormons, who founded their religion in the western part of New York. Called the \\"Burned Over District\\", this area was a center of religious fervor in the 19th century. One of his books explored social justice from a Christian perspective; this thought-provoking and controversial novel, Murvale Eastman: Christian Socialist, was published in 1890. ==Plessy v. Ferguson case== Near the end of the 19th century, the Southern states had become dominated by white Democrats. The legislatures began to pass new constitutions (beginning with Mississippi in 1890) and laws to raise barriers to voter registration to suppress the black Republican vote and to impose legal segregation in public facilities. Louisiana passed an 1890 law intended \\"to promote the comfort of passengers\\" by requiring all state railway companies \\"to provide equal but separate accommodations for the white and colored races, by providing separate coaches or compartments\\" on their passenger trains. In September 1891 a group of prominent black leaders in New Orleans, made up of mostly men who had been free people of color before the Civil War, organized a \\"Citizens' Committee\\" to challenge this law on federal constitutional grounds. To assist them in their challenge, this group retained the legal services of \\"Judge Tourg√©e,\\" as he was popularly known. Perhaps considered the nation's most outspoken white Radical on the \\"race question\\" in the late 1880s and 1890s, Tourg√©e had called for resistance to the Louisiana law in his widely read newspaper column, A Bystander's Notes. Written for the Chicago Republican (later known as the Chicago Daily Inter Ocean and after 1872 known as the Chicago Record-Herald), his column was syndicated in many newspapers across the country. Largely as a consequence of this column, \\"Judge Tourg√©e\\" had become well known in the black community for his bold denunciations of lynching, segregation, disfranchisement, white supremacy, and scientific racism. He was the first choice of the New Orleans Citizens' Committee's to lead their legal challenge to the new Louisiana segregation law. As they developed their challenge, Tourg√©e played a strategic role, for instance suggesting that a light-skinned, mixed-race African American challenge the law. Dan Desdunes, the son of prominent Citizens Committee leader Rodolphe Desdunes, was initially selected, but his case was thrown out because he had been a passenger on an interstate train, where the court ruled that state law did not apply. Homer Plessy was selected next. He was arrested after boarding an intrastate train and refusing to move from a white to a \\"colored\\" car. Tourg√©e, who was lead attorney for Homer Plessy, first deployed the term \\"color blindness\\" in his briefs in the Plessy case. He had used it on several prior occasions on behalf of the struggle for civil rights. Tourgee's first use of \\"color blindness\\" as a legal metaphor has been documented decades before, while he was serving as a Superior Court judge in North Carolina. In his dissent in Plessy, Justice John Marshall Harlan borrowed the metaphor of \\"color blindness\\" from Tourg√©e's legal brief. ==Later life== In the wake of an 1892 lynching in Memphis known as the Peoples Grocery lynching, anti-lynching activist Ida B. Wells wrote about the case. After the Memphis Commercial accused her of inciting the incident, she asked Tourgee to represent her in a libel case against the newspaper. Tourg√©e had largely retired from law (with the exception of his work with the New Orleans \\"Citizens' Committee\\") and refused. Tourg√©e recommended that Wells contact his friend, Ferdinand Lee Barnett, and Barnett agreed to take the case. This may have been Barnett's introduction to Wells. They married two years later. Barnett came to agree with Tourg√©e's assessment: that the case did not have a good chance of being won. He said that a black woman would never win such a case heard by an all- white, all-male jury in Memphis, and Wells withdrew her suit.Karcher, Carolyn L. A Refugee from His Race: Albion W. Tourg√©e and His Fight Against White Supremacy. UNC Press Books, 2016. In 1897, following Tourg√©e's involvement in the Plessy case, President William McKinley appointed him as U.S. consul to France. He sailed to Bordeaux where he was based. About 1900, Tourg√©e joined the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, an influential Civil War veterans' organization of Union men who had been commissioned officers. He was assigned Companion No. 13949. Tourg√©e served in France until his death in early 1905. He had been gravely ill for several months, but then appeared to rebound. The recovery was only brief, momentary, however, and he succumbed to acute uremia. The kidney damage was believed to be related to a Civil War wound. Tourg√©e's ashes were interred at the Mayville Cemetery, in Mayville, New York. He is commemorated by a 12-foot granite obelisk inscribed thus: I pray thee then Write me as one that loves his fellow-man.Crocker, Kathleen A., \\"Chautauqua County Lawyers Oppose Segregation: The Robert H. Jackson-Albion W. Tourgee Connection,\\" Jamestown Post-Journal, April 24, 2004. Quotation from Abou ben Adhem, by Leigh Hunt. ==Other== On September 5, 1880 Tourg√©e met his wife in court to settle a financial dispute. Tourg√©e won, and his wife was issued a $35 fine and sentenced to jail.\\"Tourg√©e in Court,\\" Rocky Mountain News, September 6, 1880 There is no evidence that she actually served any time, and their marriage did not suffer any lasting harm by this obscure incident. In fact, one biographer of Tourg√©e, after mentioning that they met as students at Kingsville Academy, made the following observation: \\"It was a case of love at first sight, on Tourgee's part at least; for when he first saw her, he confidentially remarked to a friend, 'I'm going to marry that girl,' and after an engagement of five years he did so. The remark he made to her on his death bed, 'Emma, you have been the one perfect wife,' was but little exaggerated, as succeeding events [in his life showed].\\" ==Books== Fiction *Toinette (1874) *Figs and Thistles: A Western Story (1879) *A Fool's Errand (1879) *Bricks Without Straw (1880) *'Zouri's Christmas (1881) *John Eax and Marmelon; or, The South Without the Shadow (1882) *Hot Plowshares (1883) *Button's Inn (1887) *Black Ice (1888) *With Gauge and Swallow, Attorneys (1889) *Murvale Eastmas, Christian Socialist (1890) *Pactolus Prime (1890) *'89 (1891) *A Son of Old Harry (1892) *Out of the Sunset Sea (1893) *An Outing with the Queen of Hearts (1894) *The Mortgage on the Hip-Roof House (1896) *The Man Who Outlived Himself (1898) stories Nonfiction *The Code of Civil Procedure of North Carolina, with Barringer & Rodman (1878) *An Appeal to Caesar (1884) *The Veteran and His Pipe (1886) *Letters to a King (1888) *The War of the Standards: Coin and Credit vs. Coin Without Credit (1896) *The Story of a Thousand, Being a History of the 105th Volunteer Infantry, 1862-65 (1896) *A Civil War Diary, ed by Dean H.

Eden's secretary of the governor's council, Tobias Knight, was implicated when a letter written to Teach was found on the pirate's body at his death and by the fact that cargo taken from a ship captured by Teach was housed in Knight's barn. Knight's letter mentioned the governor's desire to meet with Blackbeard and this was considered sufficient evidence that Eden colluded with the pirates, but no further proof was forthcoming. Eden presented an account of his dealings with Blackbeard to the provincial council, which accepted his pleas of innocence. Nevertheless, Eden's reputation has long been clouded by his connections to Blackbeard. Governor Eden died of yellow fever in Bertie County in 1722 at the age of 48. Edenton, North Carolina is named for him. His remains were later reinterred in the churchyard of St. Paul's Episcopal Church at Edenton. ==Personal life== Eden's step-daughter Penelope married Gabriel Johnston, the sixth Governor of North Carolina. His great-grandson through that marriage was United States Congressman William Johnston Dawson. ==In popular culture== Governor Eden was featured as a character in the Hallmark Entertainment mini series Blackbeard, portrayed by Richard Chamberlain. The film takes severe dramatic license, portraying Eden as the governor of New Providence, the island which is now the capital of the Bahamas, as opposed to his real occupation as Governor of North Carolina. The film also puts heavy emphasis on Eden's historically alleged trade with Blackbeard, while also claiming that he conspired with colonial secretary Tobias Knight to arrange the murder of Eden's stepdaughter in order to claim her inheritance. ==See also== *List of colonial governors of North Carolina ==References *Woodard, Colin.

He served in the House of Commons of Canada from 1926 to 1930. He was also a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1914 to 1920 and from 1932 to 1936, and served as a cabinet minister in the government of John Bracken. McPherson was born in Worth County, Missouri, and arrived in Canada with his family in 1879. He was educated at Portage la Prairie, and worked as a barrister. He was called to the bar in 1904, and became a bench member of the Manitoba Bar Association in 1915. In 1916, he was named King's Counsel. In 1904, McPherson married Winnifred Mabel Finn. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1910 provincial election, as a Liberal in the Portage la Prairie constituency. He was defeated, losing to Conservative cabinet minister Hugh Armstrong by 199 votes. McPherson ran again in the 1914 election, and defeated Armstrong by ten votes. The Conservative administration of Rodmond Roblin was forced to resign amid scandal in 1915. The house was dissolved, and another election called. McPherson was re-elected, defeating Conservative candidate Fawcett Taylor by 258 votes. For the next five years, he served as a backbench supporter of Tobias Norris's administration. McPherson was defeated in the 1920 election, losing to Fawcett Taylor by 287 votes. Taylor's public profile had increased between 1915 and 1920, and he was chosen as leader of the Manitoba Conservative Party two years later. McPherson did not contest the 1922 provincial election, but instead turned his attention to federal politics. He was selected by the Liberal Party of Canada to run against Conservative Prime Minister Arthur Meighen in the federal election of 1926. He was successful, upsetting Meighen by 428 votes in the federal riding of Portage la Prairie. The Liberal Party won the election, and McPherson served for four years as a backbench supporter of William Lyon Mackenzie King's government. The Liberals were defeated in the 1930 provincial election, and McPherson lost his seat to Conservative candidate William Herbert Burns by 142 votes. After this loss, he turned his attention to provincial politics again. In 1922, the United Farmers of Manitoba unexpectedly won a majority of seats in the Manitoba parliament and formed government as the Progressive Party. With Mackenzie King's support, the Manitoba Liberal Party formed an electoral alliance with the Progressive Party in 1932. Although he did not yet have a seat in the legislature, McPherson was appointed to John Bracken's cabinet on May 27, 1932 as Provincial Treasurer. In the 1932 provincial election, McPherson made the questionable decision of challenging Conservative leader Fawcett Taylor again in Portage la Prairie. Although Bracken's \\"Liberal-Progressives\\" were re- elected with a majority government, McPherson went down to a resounding defeat. He had to wait until July 16, 1932 to run in a deferred election in the sprawling northern constituency of Rupertsland, and even here his election was not certain. He was forced to face another pro-government candidate, incumbent Progressive Herbert Beresford, and won by only 97 votes. Notwithstanding his difficulties in the election, McPherson continued to serve as Provincial Treasurer for the parliament that followed. He was also named Municipal Commissioner on May 10, 1935. He did not seek re-election in 1936. Some federal Liberals hoped that McPherson would replace Bracken as premier, but this did not come to pass. After leaving politics, McPherson served as Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench of Manitoba from 1937 to 1944 and then was named Manitoba Court of Appeal in 1944. He held the latter position until his death of a heart attack while attending his son's wedding anniversary in Kenora, Ontario in 1954. == References == Category:1878 births Category:1954 deaths Category:Liberal Party of Canada MPs Category:Canadian people of Scottish descent Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Manitoba Category:Judges in Manitoba Category:Members of the Executive Council of Manitoba Category:Canadian Queen's Counsel Category:Finance ministers of Manitoba ","title":"Ewan McPherson"},{"id":"2222096","text":"The 1337 was the final battle for the Nitta family in their support of the Southern Imperial Court against the Ashikaga Pretenders of the Northern Court. Nitta Yoshisada's fortress at Kanegasaki was besieged for three months by forces in support of Ashikaga Takauji. Nitta's ally Ury≈´ Tamotsu was forced back to the fortress of Somayama in March 1337, and Nitta Yoshisada joined him there soon afterwards, hoping to lead a counterstrike to lift the siege. This failed, and the occupants of the besieged castle, having run out of food and water, were forced to eat horseflesh to survive. In accordance with Buddhist belief, this was close to the worst disgrace one could face; eating horseflesh was believed to break one's karma, forcing them to be reborn in the next life as an animal or something worse. Nevertheless, the defenders held out for twenty days longer, and on April 7, K≈ç no Moroyasu, commander of the besieging army, broke through the walls and took the fortress. Prince Takanaga and Nitta Yoshiaki, son of Yoshisada, were forced to take their own lives. Prince Tsunenaga escaped, but was captured soon afterwards and killed as well. ==See also== *Siege of Kanegasaki (1570) ==References== Kanegasaki (1337) Category:1330s in Japan Category:1337 in Asia Category:Conflicts in 1337 ","title":"Siege of Kanegasaki (1337)"},{"id":"2222105","text":"Filicudi () is one of eight islands that make up the Aeolian archipelago, situated northeast of the island of Sicily, southern Italy.

The island, like the other Aeolian Islands, was settled since the Neolithic Age, around 3000 BC. As evidenced by archaeological findings, the island was occupied by a new people during the Bronze Age. The island was uninhabited for many centuries until occupied by the Greeks. Roman and Byzantine remains can also be found on the island. Since the 1970s Filicudi was rediscovered and populated by photographers and artists such as Sergio Libiszewsky, Ettore Sottsass, novelist Roland Zoss, and editor Giulio Einaudi. Their perceptions brought the island into the focus of modern tourism. ==People== * John Bonica (born 1917), anesthesiologist and professional wrestler * Roland Zoss (born 1951), novelist and composer ==See also== *List of volcanoes in Italy * List of islands of Italy ==References * *Private page of a novelist living on Filicudi *A commercial touristic website about Filicudi *Info about the island *Filicudi Society of Waltham Massachusetts Category:Aeolian Islands Category:Frazioni of the Metropolitan City of Messina ","title":"Filicudi"},{"id":"2222108","text":"Dunfermline East was a burgh constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

It was abolished for the 2005 general election as part of a major revision in the composition of parliamentary constituencies in Scotland. Most of Dunfermline East and its neighbouring constituency Kirkcaldy now make up the new seat of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. The remaining parts of the seat were moved to the new Dunfermline and West Fife and Glenrothes constituencies.

In 1994, his single \\"On the Dancefloor\\" reached the UK Singles Chart, peaking at #67. In 2002, he reached #1 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play Chart with his single \\"Caught Up\\". The song was also featured prominently in an episode of the Showtime television series Queer as Folk. In 2006, his released his single, \\"Work It Out\\" featuring Dawn Tallman under his Catch 22 Recordings label. \\"Work It Out\\" was re-released on House Trained Records in the UK, and after appearing on MTV, was play-listed on BBC Radio 1. In 2008, \\"Changes\\" was released, which was a collaboration with David Tort and DJ Ruff, and the single stayed on the Beatport digital top three downloads for two months. In 2010, DJ Disciple collaborated with top Spanish Producer Javi Mula on Sexy Lady. \\"'Sexy Lady\\" video received The Best 'Dance ClipVideo' in Spain. In December 2011, DJ Disciple collaborated with Jan & Solo on \\"U Know My Steez\\". The song became a successful product tool to promote the Pioneer Corporation product 'Steez'. In Feb 2012, Disciple collaborated with Albert Neve on \\"Romper Room\\" featuring Dru Hepkins. The track was immediately picked up by Joachim Garraud for a remix and was supported heavily by Chuckie. ==Early life== He was born to William and Julia Banks. DJ Disciple (David Banks) is the youngest of four brothers. Sherman, Stanley, Larry and Leighton. His brother Stanley Banks is the bass player for George Benson. His other brother Larry Banks plays at The Church Of The Open Door in Brooklyn. Grandmaster Flowers lived in his building, hailing from Farragut Projects. He lived across the street from Kenny Carpenter, a DJ at Studio 54, and the family were great friends with Strafe (who made the hit record \\"Set It Off\\") and Rusty Taylor, Shannon's bass player. David attended The Greater Refuge Temple, The Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ Ministry with Bishop William L. Bonner and served as the church's drummer. He left Refuge Temple and joined The Church Of The Open Door after his mother accepted the lord as her savior under Rev. Dr. Mark VC Taylor. David Banks graduated from Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School in 1984. He attended Baruch College and was introduced to House music from his friend Jerome Anderson and Ralph Davis. ==Musical careerWNYE 91.5 FM=== After a brief internship, he worked at WNYE (FM) as a radio host and mixer in 1987. Originally a Gospel DJ, he named and kept the name DJ Disciple as a reminder that 'only what you do for Christ shall last'. Disciple quickly earned a dedicated following from his on-air work at college stations WBMB and WHCS and his first professional DJ gig took place at the legendary Studio 54. In the 90's, Disciple found himself hosting ‚ÄúThe Best Kept Secret‚Äù, a mix show on WNYE (FM), where he exclusively debuted a litany of now-classic underground tracks. His show was instrumental in exposing new dance artists to mainstream radio. Artists included Roger Sanchez, Kerri Chandler, Pal Joey, Todd Edwards, 95 North, and Smack Productions. 'The Best Kept Secret' was the first show to expose female DJ's playing dance music on the radio and one of the very few shows where you could hear unreleased material from future artists not available for months. Finding success in the college circuit, and his own 'Best Kept Secret' show on the radio, Disciple became a great fit for the nightclub scene. It was DJ Camacho who gave him his first introduction to New York Underground House Music. His first trial was playing at The World with Bobby Konders back in 1989. After his performance he was made resident DJ from the outfit Wild Pitch. From there he was interviewed by Richard Vasquez and Joey Illinois at David Mancuso's space The Loft. He landed a bi-weekly residency with Larry Levan and then DJ Basil at the venue with the party then called The Choice in Lower Manhattan. He was hired by Monte Collins and Steve Miller from Phi Beta Sigma fraternity. The duo Slick & Smooth Productions helped solidify Disciple's following when he was doing their Hunter College parties and also caught the attention of fellow Sigmas Leonard Gabbidon and Stan Dennis. Gabbidon hired Disciple to close shows for Liz Torres, Jomanda, Main Source, Special Ed, Brand Nubian and Run DMC at the Syracuse Greekfest located at the Manley Fieldhouse in 1989‚Äì1991. Stan Dennis had Disciple play at the Jones Beach Greekfest while other Sigmas worked with Disciple at St John's University and The City College parties before the Stampede incident occurred. ===The early 1990s=== In 1990 Disciple worked at New Jersey's Club 280 as their Friday night resident. The venue was near Zanzibar home of Dj Tony Humphries. Club 280 had the reputation of bringing the New York Sound to New Jersey. As the night grew popular Disciple was then asked to play at Zanzibar since Tony had left. Being instrumental in breaking Aly-Us 'Follow Me' both on radio and in New Jersey, Disciple took on his next task to play Zanzibar. It was a task met with failure and a lesson learned. 'The Best Kept Secret' (91.5 FM) was so popular that Disciple later on was asked to be a regular mixer for Japan's Bay FM radio show and his recordings of the show were being sold in London's Camden Market. In 1992 it was Roger Sanchez who introduced Disciple to traveling by connecting him to be booked in San Francisco. Simultaneously he was introduced by David Camacho to John Paul Firman. John Firman, interested in representing Disciple for the UK set him up to play Lakota in Bristol and a year later Ministry of Sound. In both cases Disciple's reputation grew. Disciple debuted at Ministry of Sound playing in the smaller room for Bert Bevans birthday party in 1993. It was there that Disciple broke 'Show Me Love' by Robin S. to the London audience. From that moment on Ministry Of Sound had Disciple play the main room of its venue from 1993 - 2001 at least twice a year. In 1993 Disciple debuted his first single on Muzik Pushers. Home to Bobby Davis S.U.R.E record pool. 'When The Music Stop' one of the singles from the EP became a club hit in Italy. Record label D:vision Records snapped it up giving Disciple even more exposure. Disciple then made his debut in at Angels Of Love in Naples, Italy the same year. Knowing he was on to something Disciple continued to produce but worked with Eddie Perez in 1994. Disciple produced The Street Experience EP and the single from it 'On The Dancefloor' hit the UK singles charts at #67. That year Disciple played fifty dates in the UK alone. Venues included Cream (Liverpool), Ministry of Sound, (London) (two times), Hard Times (Leeds) (two times), Lakota, (Bristol) (two times), Garage City, London (three times), Notting Hill Carnival, The Middlesbrough Empire, The Zap (Brighton) and others. From 1995 to 1997 Disciple played at Southport Weekender and Owner Alex Lowe had Disciple play To The Manor Born three times a year from 1994 until 2004. Keith 'KCC' Franklin had Disciple debut at his KCC and the Rocking Crew Notting Hill Carnival event. Disciple had been a regular guest playing from 1994 until 2010. Venues such as Hard Times were responsible for exposing Disciple to Northern cub culture. When Hard Times came to London it was hailed one of the biggest events of the year. The event was called Down-N-Out In London at Bagleys. Hard Times formed Hard Times The Label. One of the first releases had Disciple remixing Robert Owens and Michael Watford on the release 'Come Together'. Disciple's profile had grown so big that he made it into the top 100 DJ's for DJ Magazine in 1995, one year after the magazine did his first featured interview. While JP Firman helped solidify Disciple's career in the UK, it was Bobby & Steve that helped propel it even further. The Zoo Experience was a radio show on Kiss FM London headed by the two brothers promoting soulful House as well as the UK's most established night, Garage City. From 1993 until its close in 2003 Disciple played at least twice a year. With a reputation for getting music way before its release date, Disciple was the first to break both 'Deep Inside' and 'Beautiful People' (both singles from Barbara Tucker) on the show. It was from that point that Disciple became a regular guest mixer, spinning a one-hour mix at least three times a year. Anytime Disciple came to London The Zoo Experience always had venues waiting to have him booked. Whether it be Fabric, Turnmills or Legends, Bobby & Steve considered Disciple a part of them and pushed him as far as exposure went. His releases of \\"Keep On Moving\\", \\"Don't Shut Me Out\\" (Interstate) and his remix of Plutonic's \\"I'm Addicted\\" were influential records on the UK Garage scene. Disciple would regularly travel to Canada to play with Peter, Tyrone and Shams for the 'Thundergroove Sundays' at Oz one of the first venues to bring in the big-name house DJs before places like Industry and The Guvernment existed. While living in London, Disciple worked with Grant Nelson. The two decided to do a swap. Grant Nelson engineered two tracks for Disciple's EP on Todd Terry's Freeze record label and in turn Disciple would do vocals for his debut on Swing City records. 'To The Bone' was the first single that Disciple's radio voice was actually used on a record. Todd Terry, a fan of sampling decided to release 'Latin Love' (Rip Off Mix) from the Vinyl Factory EP. The record bought Disciple a huge amount of exposure but the record had to be recalled because of the controversial sample. ===The late 1990s=== \\"Steal Away\\", one of the tracks off of the e.p.was used by Erick Morillo for his Ministry Of Sound Compilation and the second track 'Burning' was licensed to Deconstructed records in the UK. After releasing The Fixed EP on Ultra Music and remixing for various artists like Plutonic ('Addicted'/ Bold) Disciple decided to work with internationally acclaimed artists. The first hit for the label was in 1998. 'Put Your Hands Up' by the Black & White Brothers. The record sold four million copies worldwide since its original signing.\\"Put Your Hands Up\\" by the Black & White Brothers helped expose the label Catch 22 Worldwide it was licensed to Happy Music (France) (21), Edel (Germany), United (Benelux), Planet Works (Greece), Energy (Italy), Blanco Y Negro (Spain), Hotter (Argentina), and Central Station (Australia). This record was known the world over, but very few recognized that Catch 22 signed this record and the buzz originally started when Roger S. and others got their hands on the Catch 22 copy in Miami Winter Music Conference of 1998. After the overground success of the Black & White Brothers, Disciple decided to give his friend DJ Dove an opportunity or a Catch 22 Release. Inaya Day had a string of hits including Boris Dlugosh's hit record \\"Keep On Movin‚Äù. The two worked out perfectly under the guidance of Frankie Feliciano and Junior Sanchez\\". Slip-N-Slide Records picked the track up for the UK. 1997 saw Disciple debut in Montreal for the first time spinning with Deep Dish at Sona. His set was so impressive that the after hour club that held 3,000 people had him play twice a year from 1998 - 2004. Disciple loved the club so much that he made his EP 'Sona/Industry'a trademark of his sets for the record label Ultra Music. After remixing 'Love's Here At Last' by Judy Albanese for Maxi Records, the label commissioned Disciple to do 'House Disciple' a mix CD compilation for the company in 1998. The tour is kicked off in Miami with Disciple playing with Giles Peterson, Pete Heller, and Daft Punk at the Giant Step event. Disciple left WNYE in 1997 and joined Tony Walker to combine forces and do the Transatlantic Mix. First broadcasting at KISS 100 in London and then on Galaxy Radio. Mixmag called it \\"An underground, grass roots show but with all the benefits of commercial radio.\\" The show was such a success it was later translated into a global syndication. The tour sold out numerous dates as far and wide as Australia and the US. In 1998 Disciple made regular appearances at Spy Bar, one of the first bottle service venues in New York. During the golden age of bottle service, Disciple worked at Pangea, with Walter Kim at Rehab and Quo, Jamie Muholland at Cain, Versace Mansion at Florida, Rocco Ancarola at Pink Elephant, and the Made Italy parties held at Green House. Disciple was also the monthly resident DJ at GBH (Great British House) with promoters Tom Dunkley and Alejandro Torio moving from Vanity to Cheetah and then finally Centrofly. ===My True Colors (2000)=== Taka Boom, sister of Chaka Khan worked with Disciple on \\"Wanna Be\\" the first single from his album My True Colors. For the single Disciple would go to Brighton to visit Steve Mac a.k.a. Steve McGuinness and Robert Chetcuti also known as the Rhythm Masters. Disciple worked with a variety of talent, while producing the tracks at Jeremy Sylvester's studio in Birmingham.The album included a forty date tour around the country as well as support from many of the dance publications. \\"Yes\\" featuring Inaya Day was released by Hed Kandi in 2005. \\"It's Easy\\" was released on Azuli records in 2000, while \\"You\\" was remixed by Roger Sanchez (2001), and \\"Keep It Up\\" was a collaboration with Robbie Rivera. Rivera and Disciple met in 1999 during The Winter Music Conference. The duo worked on two projects besides the album track \\"Keep It Up\\". Bass & Treble (Juicy Music) appeared on Carl Cox Global CD while \\"Super Drum\\" got picked up by Azuli Records. The two collaborated on Winter Music Conference events for two years. ===Around The World In 150 Clubs Tour=== In 2001 Disciple joined the website team of Trust The DJ. From 2001 to 2006 Disciple's journals paved the way for the concept of 'Around The World In 150 Clubs. Detailing both past and present venues and life choices and lifestyles that came with it. In his Trust The DJ Journals, Disciple is showcased in notable venues in Africa, Europe, Australia, North America, South America, Asia, and the Middle East. ===Billboard and Grammy nominations=== The album featured Mia Cox who performed 'Caught Up'.

Love Tattoo's seminal hit ‚ÄòThe Bass Has Got Me Movin‚Äô that earned him an ARIA Music Awards in Australia. \\"Ill Concepts\\" Nympho Soundz - A name Disciple started with one half of the Rhythm Masters, Steve Mac was a very n controversial record. The track \\"Ill Concepts\\" contained the same sample that was used on Felix da Housecat‚Äôs \\"Cry Baby\\" outing on UK label Credence. Bad Boy Bill, Dj Dan, John Aquaviva, DJ Irene and Richard Vission made the track a US rave anthem. It was heavily featured in their compilations. It was the first official release from Nympho Soundz and yet again it was a label that people did not associate Disciple with.

C. Green Jr. (born October 4, 1963) is an American retired professional basketball player. Nicknamed \\"Iron Man\\", he holds a National Basketball Association (NBA) record for most consecutive regular season games played with 1,192. Green played for the Los Angeles Lakers, Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks and Miami Heat. He found most success with the Lakers, with whom he won three championships in 1987, 1988 and 2000, and was named an NBA All-Star in 1990. Green was born and raised in Portland, Oregon, attending Benson Polytechnic High School and Oregon State University. He was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 2003. ==Early life== Green was born in Portland, Oregon. He was given the initials \\"A. C.\\" like his father A. C. Green Sr. The initials stand for his father's mother, Amanda, and his father's father, Chester. Green converted to Christianity in the town of Hermiston, Oregon, while he was still in high school. He never missed a class in his educational career. == College career== Green attended Oregon State University, where he finished second in school history in rebounding and fourth in scoring. He was an All-Pac-10 selection as a sophomore, and as a junior he ranked fourth in the nation in field goal percentage at .657. As a senior, he averaged 19.1 points and 9.2 rebounds and was named to the All-America Third Team. He was inducted into the Pac-12 Basketball Hall of Honor during the 2012 Pac-12 Conference Men's Basketball Tournament, March 10, 2012.2011-12 Hall of Honor Class Announced, Pac-12 Conference, February 7, 2012 ==Professional career Los Angeles Lakers (1985‚Äì1993)=== The Los Angeles Lakers, fresh from winning an NBA championship, selected Green in the first round as the 23rd overall pick in the 1985 NBA draft. Green led the Lakers in rebounding for six of his eight years on the team. Led by Magic Johnson, James Worthy and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Los Angeles captured back-to-back titles in 1987 and 1988, Green's second and third years with the squad. In the two campaigns combined, he averaged 11.1 points and 8.2 rebounds while shooting better than .500 from the field. Green also reached the NBA Finals with Los Angeles in 1989 and 1991. Green was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team in 1988‚Äì89, was voted a starter on the 1990 Western Conference All-Star Team and finished fourth in the league in field goal percentage in 1992‚Äì93 at .537. === Phoenix Suns (1993‚Äì1996)=== Green left the Lakers in 1993 to sign with the Phoenix Suns as a free agent. The Suns had just reached the NBA Finals, losing in six games to the Chicago Bulls, and they viewed Green as the missing piece to their championship puzzle. Green posted a career-high average of 14.7 points per game in 1993‚Äì94, but the Suns were eliminated in the conference semifinals. In 1994‚Äì95 he again contributed double-figure scoring and solid rebounding for the Suns, but his playing time and contributions dipped in 1995‚Äì96; though he remained the team's second-leading rebounder. His streak of consecutive games played almost ended during a game with the New York Knicks when J. R. Reid intentionally elbowed him in the face. Green lost two teeth and suffered a head injury but was still able to continue on with his streak by wearing a protective mask and only playing a couple of minutes a game for a few weeks. === Dallas Mavericks (1997‚Äì1999)=== Green was traded two months into the 1996‚Äì97 season to the Dallas Mavericks in the deal that brought Jason Kidd to Phoenix. He brought reliable rebounding to the rebuilding Mavs. He tied Shawn Bradley for the team lead in rebounding in 1997‚Äì98 with 8.1 rpg, but his season highlight came on November 20 against Golden State when he played in his 907th consecutive game, becoming the league's all-time iron man, surpassing Randy Smith's mark of 906 consecutive games played. Green played in his 1,000th consecutive game on March 13, 1999, against Vancouver, and finished the 1998‚Äì99 season at 1,028 in a row and counting. After 14 seasons in the league, Green had missed only three games, all during the 1986‚Äì87 season (his second in the league). === Return to the Lakers (1999‚Äì2000) === Green returned to the Los Angeles Lakers for the 1999‚Äì2000 season where he won his last NBA championship with the Lakers by defeating the resilient Sacramento Kings in five games in the first round, his former team the Phoenix Suns also in five games in the second round and finally the talented Portland Trail Blazers in the Western Conference Finals en route to defeating the Indiana Pacers in six games to win the series and the 2000 NBA Championship, Green's third championship. ===Miami Heat (2000‚Äì2001)=== Green played his final NBA season with the Miami Heat where he was reunited with Pat Riley. The Heat made the playoffs, where they were swept 3‚Äì0 by the Charlotte Hornets. === Iron man streak === Green's 1192 consecutive games played streak began on November 19, 1986, when the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the San Antonio Spurs in San Antonio. The streak ended with the last game of his career on April 18, 2001, when the Miami Heat defeated the Orlando Magic in Orlando. In addition to this streak, he also managed to miss only three games throughout his entire playing career, all of which came during his second season in the NBA. == Personal life == Green visits the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2004. Green is a devout Christian. He is known for proclaiming that he began and ended his NBA career as a virgin bachelor. During his rookie year, his teammates sent a woman to tempt him to compromise his commitment. He established the A.C. Green Youth Foundation in 1989, which operates youth camps to promote abstinence until marriage. In 2000, he wore a green bear on his head while on the bench during basketball games to promote his foundation. Green suffered from singultus, or chronic hiccups, during his NBA career, the hiccups only stopping when Green was running or working out. Reportedly, Green never slept more than two hours at a time due to the condition. He has since recovered. In 2011, he was awarded the Bobby Jones Award by Athletes in Action for character, leadership, and faith in the world of basketball, in the home and the community. Green's humanitarian efforts earned him a spot in the World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame.http://www.ubaindia.com/news/raising-the-game-nba-legendary- ironman-a.c-green-joins-uba/ Green married his wife Veronique in 2002.http://waitingtillmarriage.org/iron-man-a-c-green/ In 2015, Green was a judge for the 2015 Boost Mobile NBA D-League Slam Dunk Contest.http://dleague.nba.com/news/jarvis-threatt-wins-2015-boost-mobile- slam-dunk-contest/ Jarvis Threatt Wins Boost Mobile Slam Dunk Contest In 2017, Green signed to be the Director of Sports for the United Basketball Alliance of India. == NBA career statistics  Regular season === -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" L.A.

The company now offers more than 4,000 life science products used by scientists, researchers and life science and pharmaceutical companies. Promega has 1,601 employees. Revenue is approaching $450 million (USD) in 2019. The privately held company has branch offices in 16 countries and more than 50 global distributors serving 100 countries. Promega Corporation also established the first biotechnology joint venture in China (Sino-American Biotechnology Co. in 1985). The company has developed an on- site stocking system, which uses radio frequency identification (RFID) linked to the Internet to track and manage remote inventory. This resulted in the spin-off company Terso Solutions that specializes in the design and manufacturing of small RFID storage units.2005 Report: Promega spins off RFID unit. The Capital Times. November 15. Business, 8B. Retrieved on July 7, 2008. In February 2020, it was reported by Foreign Policy that Promega had sold equipment to the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. ==Product areas and technologiesGenomics=== The company's portfolio began with products for genomics researchers and now includes cloning systems, luciferase reporters, and amplification products as well as the original restriction and modifying enzymes. The portfolio of amplification products includes the GoTaq family of polymerases, buffers and the Plexor quantitative PCR system. ===Genetic identity and forensics=== The company is one of two main suppliers of systems for genetic identification based on DNA analysis using short tandem repeats (STRs).Amplification on-line training course at DNA.gov Promega was the first company to provide kits for STR analysis of single loci. Along with Applied Biosystems, Promega participated with the FBI and other crime labs in validating STR loci that would eventually be selected as the core loci for the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), used for forensic DNA testing in North America. The Promega PowerPlex STR systems were the first commercially available systems for STR analysis that contained all of the CODIS loci. ===Proteomics=== Promega was an early supplier in the cell-free protein synthesis field and is continuing to develop its portfolio in this area. ===Cellular analysis and drug discovery=== Promega offers a range of products for cell biology and drug discovery, many of which are built upon bioluminescence technology. Assays for drug discovery are used globally and include biochemical and cell-based assays. In 2010, Promega launched a custom assay services business for biologics and small molecule drug development. ===Integrated platforms=== The company's bioluminescence assays, DNA and RNA purification chemistries, and HaloTag technologies integrate with the high- throughput automated systems found in many laboratories. Some of this integration has occurred through collaboration with instrument manufacturers. The company also sells their own Maxwell RSC and Maxwell RSC 48 Systems, bench-top automated purification systems for low and middle throughput research and diagnostic laboratories.(2008) Promega gets CE Mark for DNA purification system. GenomeWeb Daily May 29. (accessed July 18, 2008) Promega GloMax Luminometers are supplied with preinstalled protocols that allow researchers to perform multiplex bioluminescent assays.

Block appeared that day in the Spokane newspaper Industrial Worker, smoking a cigar and wearing a checkered suit with top hat. Subsequently, Mr. Block lost the fancy clothes but often kept a hat, ten sizes too small, perched on one corner of his wooden blockhead. \\"Mr. Block is legion,\\" wrote Walker C.

Mr. Block owns nothing, yet he speaks from the standpoint of the millionaire; he is patriotic without patrimony; he is a law-abiding outlaw...

He was a member of the House of Commons of Canada from 1921 to 1925, served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1927 to 1936, and was a cabinet minister in the government of John Bracken. Hoey was born in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Ireland, and came to Canada in 1909. He was educated at Wesley College and Manitoba College in Winnipeg and became a pioneer worker in the farmer's movement. He served as provincial director of the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM) in 1918, and worked as the UFM's field secretary from 1919 to 1921. He was elected to the House of Commons in Canada's federal election of 1921 as a Progressive candidate, defeating Liberal candidate Thomas Molloy by 1,397 votes in the riding of Springfield. He served on the opposition benches of parliament for the next four years, and did not seek re-election in 1925. He returned to farm organization after leaving the House of Commons in 1925, taking part in the organization of the Western Wheat Pools. The United Farmers of Manitoba unexpectedly won a government majority in the 1922 provincial election, and formed government as the Progressive Party of Manitoba. Hoey was asked to become Premier of Manitoba but declined. John Bracken was then selected in his place. On April 28, 1927, Hoey joined Bracken's provincial government as Minister of Education. He did not hold a seat in the legislature at the time but was a prominent campaigner for the Progressive Party in the 1927 provincial election, and defeated independent incumbent Donald A. Ross by 710 votes in the St. Clements constituency. He was easily returned in the 1932 election and served as Minister of Education until the end of his nine-year tenure in the legislature. He also served as acting Attorney General from February 22 to May 18, 1929. In 1932, Hoey played a prominent role in negotiations between Manitoba's Progressive and Liberal parties, which resulted in a Liberal- Progressive electoral alliance. The alliance eventually became a permanent partnership, and government members became known as \\"Liberal-Progressives.\\" Hoey was defeated in the 1936 provincial election, losing to Independent Labour Party candidate Herbert Sulkers by 665 votes. After his electoral defeat in 1936, he became Superintendent of Welfare and Training in the Indian Affairs Branch of the federal Department of Mines and Resources. He served in that position until March 1945, when he became Director of the Indian Affairs Branch, a position that he held until 1948.http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/hoey_ra.shtml Hoey was appointed to a seat on the Northwest Territories Council in 1946, and served to 1951. ==References *Manitoba Historical Society biography * Category:1883 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories Category:Progressive Party of Canada MPs Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Manitoba Category:People from Enniskillen Category:Members of the Executive Council of Manitoba Category:Progressive Party of Manitoba MLAs ","title":"Robert Hoey"},{"id":"2222169","text":"Universal Music Group Nashville is Universal Music Group's country music subsidiary. Some of the labels in this group include MCA Nashville Records, Mercury Nashville Records, Lost Highway Records, Capitol Records Nashville and EMI Records Nashville. UMG Nashville not only handles these imprints, but also manages the country music catalogues of record labels Universal Music and predecessor companies acquired over the years including ABC Records, Decca Records, Dot Records, DreamWorks Records, Kapp Records, MGM Records and Polydor Records. ==MCA Nashville== 200px MCA Nashville started out as the country music division of Decca Records in 1945, founded by Paul Cohen in New York. In 1947, Cohen hired Owen Bradley as his assistant working in Nashville. The country music division moved to Nashville in 1955 as much of the country music recording business was locating there. Bradley succeeded Cohen as head of Decca's Nashville division in 1958 and developed Decca into a country music powerhouse. Decca Nashville was renamed MCA Nashville in 1973. In 1979, MCA Nashville absorbed the country music roster (including Roy Clark, Barbara Mandrell and The Oak Ridge Boys) and back catalogue of ABC Records including the Dot Records catalogue. In the early 1980s, MCA Nashville signed Reba McEntire and George Strait, two of the greatest selling artists of all time and the mega stars on the record label. In the 1990s MCA Nashville briefly revived the Decca label for country music releases, but it was shut down after Universal Music absorbed PolyGram and chose to reserve the Decca name for classical music releases. While Decca resumed issuing country music in February 2008, the current Decca country music department has no connection with UMG Nashville. However, MCA Nashville continues to reissue past country releases from Decca, as well as those on the Kapp label. With the absorption of MCA Records into Geffen Records in 2003, MCA Nashville, apart from UMG's operations in the Philippines, is now the only unit of UMG to still use the MCA name. {  !Current Artists - Kassi Ashton - Jordan Davis - Vince Gill - Sam Hunt - Parker McCollum - Reba McEntire - Kip Moore - Kacey Musgraves - George Strait - Josh Turner } ==Mercury Nashville== right The still active Mercury Records was formed in Chicago in 1945 issuing recordings in a variety of genres including country music. The Nashville office of Mercury began as a joint venture between Mercury and \\"Pappy\\" Daily's established country music record label Starday Records in January 1957. In July 1958, the Mercury/Starday joint venture was dissolved and Starday record producer Shelby Singleton stayed on with Mercury in Nashville, becoming head of Mercury's Nashville office by 1961. Singleton left Mercury in 1966 to form his own company which bought Sun Records in 1969. In 1986 American country music singer and songwriter Johnny Cash was dropped by Columbia Nashville and then signed up for Mercury Nashville and his first album was Johnny Cash Is Coming to Town and Cash made several excellent and unforgettable hits from 1987 to 1991 with Mercury Nashville. In 1997, PolyGram, which owned Mercury, consolidated all its Nashville operations under the Mercury name. When PolyGram was purchased by Universal Music Group in 1998, the resulting record label consolidations left Mercury under The Island Def Jam Music Group umbrella making Mercury in the USA dormant until recently, but still active internationally. The consolidations in Nashville which created UMG Nashville kept the Mercury Nashville imprint active. Reissues of country music recordings first issued on the MGM, Polydor, and other former PolyGram labels bear the Mercury Nashville imprint (with some exceptions). {  !Current Artists - Lauren Alaina - Billy Currington - Travis Denning - Maddie & Tae - Chris Stapleton - Shania Twain } ==Capitol Records Nashville== Capitol Records Nashville is a major United States-based record label located in Nashville Tennessee operating as part of the Capitol Music Group.

G. Wodehouse, first published in the United States on October 8, 1920McIlvaine, E., Sherby, L.S. and Heineman, J.H. (1990) P.G. Wodehouse: A comprehensive bibliography and checklist. New York: James H. Heineman, pp. 36-37. by George H. Doran, New York, (under the title The Little Warrior), and in the United Kingdom by Herbert Jenkins, London, on 4 July 1921. It was serialised in Collier's (US) between 10 April and 28 August 1920, in Maclean's (Canada) between 1 August and 15 November 1920, in both cases as The Little Warrior, and, as Jill the Reckless, in the Grand Magazine (UK), from September 1920 to June 1921. The heroine here, Jill Mariner, is a sweet-natured and wealthy young woman who, at the opening, is engaged to a knighted MP, Sir Derek Underhill. We follow her through financial disaster, an adventure with a parrot, a policeman and the colourful proletariat, a broken engagement, an awkward stay with some grasping relatives, employment as a chorus girl, and the finding of true love. Other characters include wealthy, dimwitted clubman Freddie Rooke, ruggedly attractive writer Wally Mason, both of these childhood friends of Jill's; her financially inept uncle Major Christopher Selby; and Sir Derek's domineering mother, Lady Underhill; Jill's unpleasant relatives on Long Island, New York; Elmer, Julia and Tibby Mariner; Drones Club member Algy Martyn, various chorus girls, composers and other theatrical types, and miscellaneous servants. George Bevan, composer hero of Wodehouse's previous work A Damsel in Distress, receives a passing mention, as does an unspecified member of the Threepwood family. Algy Martyn later appears in Company for Henry. The dust jacket of the UK first edition published by Herbert Jenkins was designed by Edmund Blampied. ==References *The Russian Wodehouse Society's page, with numerous book covers and a list of characters * Category:Novels by P.

One such league, the Campeonato Paulista, which started in 1902, is the oldest football competition in Brazil. Due to their long tradition, they are highly regarded. Historically, because of economical or geographical issues, the long distances between important cities of the country made the Brazilian people develop a strong competitive culture within the states. So, each Brazilian state has its own state championship. As of 2009, most of the state championships start in January and conclude in early May (23 dates assigned to matches). Due to these competitions, some matches between rival clubs of the same state or city have a similar or bigger importance than an interstate match between two important clubs. These local matches are called cl√°ssicos (classics, or derbies). Some examples are Flamengo-Vasco in Rio de Janeiro; Corinthians-Palmeiras in S√£o Paulo; Atl√©tico Mineiro-Cruzeiro in Minas Gerais; N√°utico-Sport in Pernambuco; Gr√™mio-Internacional in Rio Grande do Sul; Atl√©tico Paranaense-Coritiba in Paran√°; Bahia-Vit√≥ria in Bahia. The state champions and, in some states, the runners-up, are automatically qualified to play in the following year's Copa do Brasil. Also, the best placed clubs of each state which are not competing in the Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A, S√©rie B or S√©rie C qualify to the same year's S√©rie D. In addition, the best teams in each state league also may qualify to regional cups like the Copa do Nordeste and the Copa Verde. ==List of state football leagues in Brazil== {  - !width=175pxFederal unit !width=225pxChampionship !width=130px2019 Champion !width=130px2020 Champion -  Acre Campeonato Acriano Atl√©tico Acreano Galvez -  Alagoas Campeonato Alagoano CSA CRB -  Amap√° Campeonato Amapaense Santos (AP) Ypiranga -  Amazonas Campeonato Amazonense Manaus No champion -  Bahia Campeonato Baiano Bahia Bahia -  Cear√° Campeonato Cearense Fortaleza -  Distrito Federal Campeonato Brasiliense Gama Gama -  Esp√≠rito Santo Campeonato Capixaba Vit√≥ria -  Goi√°s Campeonato Goiano Atl√©tico Goianiense -  Maranh√£o Campeonato Maranhense Imperatriz Sampaio Corr√™a -  Mato Grosso Campeonato Mato-Grossense Cuiab√° -  Mato Grosso do Sul Campeonato Sul-Mato-Grossense √Åguia Negra -  Minas Gerais Campeonato Mineiro Cruzeiro Atl√©tico Mineiro -  Par√° Campeonato Paraense Remo Paysandu -  Para√≠ba Campeonato Paraibano Botafogo (PB) Treze -  Paran√° Campeonato Paranaense Atl√©tico Paranaense Atl√©tico Paranaense -  Pernambuco Campeonato Pernambucano Sport Salgueiro -  Piau√≠ Campeonato Piauiense R√≠ver -  Rio de Janeiro Campeonato Carioca Flamengo Flamengo -  Rio Grande do Norte Campeonato Potiguar Am√©rica de Natal ABC -  Rio Grande do Sul Campeonato Ga√∫cho Gr√™mio Gr√™mio -  Rond√¥nia Campeonato Rondoniense Vilhenense -  Roraima Campeonato Roraimense S√£o Raimundo (RR) -  Santa Catarina Campeonato Catarinense Ava√≠ Chapecoense -  S√£o Paulo Campeonato Paulista Corinthians Palmeiras -  Sergipe Campeonato Sergipano Frei Paulistano Confian√ßa -  Tocantins Campeonato Tocantinense Palmas } ==Unrelegated football clubs== The first column of this table lists all clubs that have continuously played in their premier state league since debuting more than ten years ago.
