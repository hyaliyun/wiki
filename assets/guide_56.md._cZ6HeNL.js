Born in Cloughduv, County Cork, Barry-Murphy first played competitive hurling during his schooling at St Finbarr's College, Farranferris. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty when he first linked up with the Cork junior team before later joining the senior side. He made his senior debut during the 1926 championship. Barry-Murphy immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen, and won four All-Ireland medals, five Munster medals and two National Hurling League medals. The All-Ireland-winning captain of 1929, he was an All- Ireland runner-up on one occasion. At international level Barry-Murphy played for the victorious Tailteann Games hurling team in 1932. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, he won five Railway Cup medals. At club level Barry-Murphy was a one-time championship medallist with √âire √ìg, while he also played with Cloughduv and St. Finbarr's. His brothers, John, Barry and Neil, all played for Cork, while his grand-nephew, Jimmy Barry-Murphy, is regarded as one of the most iconic players of all-time. Throughout his career Barry-Murphy made 35 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1935 championship. In retirement from playing Barry-Murphy became involved in team management and coaching. He was a selector with three All-Ireland-winning Cork teams between 1941 and 1944. ==Playing careerClub=== Barry-Murphy began his club hurling career with Cloughduv, however, a merger with various local clubs in 1928 led to the formation of √âire √ìg. The newly formed club, with Barry-Murphy as a key member, entered the senior ranks in their inaugural campaign, winning the championship after a 5-2 to 3-2 defeat of Mallow in the decider. By 1932 Barry-Murphy had joined the St. Finbarr's club, however, after a disappointing few years with the club he rejoined the Cloughduv team in 1935. In the twilight of his career Barry-Murphy helped Cloughduv to some of their greatest successes. In 1940 a 10-00 to 5-1 trouncing of Newtownshandrum gave him a highly sought-after championship medal in the junior grade. The following year Barry-Murphy added a championship medal in the intermediate grade to his collection, following Cloughduv's 6-4 to 3-0 defeat of Buttevant. This win meant that Barry-Murphy is one of the few hurlers to have made a clean sweep of junior, intermediate and senior championship medals. ===Inter-county=== Cork junior Barry-Murphy first appeared for Cork as a member of the junior team in 1923. He won a Munster medal that year following an 8-4 to 5-1 defeat of Tipperary in the decider. Barry-Murphy was at centre-forward for the subsequent All-Ireland decider, which was delayed by over a year. A narrow 3-4 to 3-2 defeat by Offaly denied Barry-Murphy a winners' medal on that occasion. After provincial defeat the following year, the Cork junior team bounced back in 1925. Barry-Murphy won a second Munster medal that year following a 6-3 to 4-2 defeat of Clare in the decider. The subsequent All-Ireland decider, which was once again delayed by almost a year, saw Cork defeat Dublin by 5-6 to 1-0, giving Barry-Murphy an All-Ireland Junior Hurling Championship medal. Early success Barry- Murphy was a regular for Cork during the 1925-26 league, the inaugural running of the competition, and collected a first National Hurling League medal following a 3-7 to 1-5 defeat of Dublin in the decider. He made his senior championship debut on 30 May 1926 in a 12-3 to 5-2 Munster quarter-final defeat of Waterford. Barry-Murphy later won his first Munster medal following a three-game saga with Tipperary, culminating in a 3-6 to 2-4 victory for Cork. On 24 October 1926 he lined out in his first senior All-Ireland decider, as Cork faced Kilkenny for the first time since 1912. At a snow-covered Croke Park, the first half was even enough with Cork holding an interval lead of one point, however, Kilkenny slumped in the second half, going down to a 4-6 to 2-0 defeat. It was Barry-Murphy's first All-Ireland medal. Cork retained the provincial crown in 1927, with Barry-Murphy collecting a second Munster medal following a 5-3 to 3-4 defeat of Clare. He was switched to full-back for Cork's subsequent All-Ireland meeting with Dublin on 4 September 1927. The Metropolitans were well on top in the opening thirty minutes and took a 2-3 to 0-1 lead at the interval. Cork fought back in the third quarter, however, an expert display of goalkeeping by Tommy Daly saved the day by keeping Mick \\"Gah\\" Ahern scoreless, as Dublin went on to win by 4-8 to 1-3. Continued dominance In 1928 Barry-Murphy won a third Munster medal following a 6-4 to 2-2 defeat of Clare in a replay. On 9 September 1928 Cork faced Galway in the All-Ireland decider. The Westerners, who got a bye into the final without lifting a hurley, were no match as a rout ensued. \\"Gah\\" Ahern ran riot scoring 5-4, a record for an All-Ireland final, as Cork triumphed by 6-12 to 1-0. It was Barry-Murphy's second All-Ireland medal. Barry-Murphy was appointed captain of the team in 1929 and won a fourth successive Munster medal as Cork made it four-in-a-row following a 4-6 to 2-3 defeat of Waterford. On 1 September 1929 Cork faced Galway in the All-Ireland final for the second successive year. Little had changed in a year as Cork were on the top of their game again. A rout ensued as \\"the Rebels\\" and Barry-Murphy claimed a third All-Ireland title from four final appearances with a 4-9 to 1-3 victory. He also had the honour of lifting the Liam MacCarthy Cup. Cork exited the championship at the first hurdle in 1930, however, Barry-Murphy finished the year by winning a second league medal following a 3-5 to 3-0 defeat of Dublin the decider. Fourth All-Ireland medal Barry-Murphy won a fifth Munster medal 1in 1931 following a 5-4 to 1-2 defeat of Waterford. 6 September 1931 saw Kilkenny face Cork in the All-Ireland final for the first time in five years. The first half was closely contested, with a goal from \\"Gah\\" Ahern helping Cork to a half-time lead of 1-3 to 0-2. Cork stretched the advantage to six points in the second half, but Kilkenny came storming back with a goal and then four points on the trot to take the lead by one point. In the dying moments Cork captain Eudie Coughlan got possession and made his way towards the goal. As he did so he slipped and fell but struck the sliotar while he was down on his knees, and it went over the bar for the equalising point. A 1-6 apiece draw was the result. 11 October 1931 was the date of the replay and proved to be just as exciting a contest as the first game. Kilkenny's Lory Meagher was playing the best hurling of his career at this time and scored a magnificent point from 90 yards out the field. In spite of this great effort a winner couldn‚Äôt be found and both sides finished level again at 2-5 apiece. After this game officials pressed for extra time, however, Eudie Coughlan rejected this. It was also suggested at a meeting of Central Council that both teams be declared joint champions and that half an All-Ireland medal by given to each player. This motion was later defeated. As the All-Ireland saga went to a third meeting on 1 November 1931, Kilkenny's captain Meagher was ruled out of the game because of broken ribs sustained in the first replay. Such was the esteem in which he was held the game was virtually conceded to Cork since the star player couldn't play. In spite of fielding a younger team, Kilkenny were defeated by Cork on a score line of 5-8 to 3-4. It was Barry-Murphy's fourth and final All-Ireland medal. On 28 July 1935 Barry-Murphy played his last game for Cork in a 3-12 to 2-3 Munster semi-final defeat by Limerick ===Inter-provincial=== In 1927 Barry-Murphy was chosen on the inaugural Munster inter-provincial team which narrowly fell to Leinster in the decider. Barry-Murphy was included on the team once again in 1928. A 5-3 to 3-1 defeat of arch rivals Leinster gave him his first Railway Cup medal. It was the start of a great run of success for the province as three further final defeats of Leinster brought Barry-Murphy's medal tally to four. Defeat was Barry-Murphy's lot over the next two years, however, the team bounced back in 1934. A convincing 6-3 to 3-2 victory gave him a fifth and final Railway Cup medal. ===International=== In 1932 Barry-Murphy's prowess as one of the top players of his era was recognised when he was chosen for the Ireland national hurling team for the Tailteann Games. A defeat of Scotland, whose players relied on their shinty, gave him a winners' medal. ==Selector== In retirement from playing Barry-Murphy was added to the six-man Cork senior hurling selection team in 1941. An outbreak of foot and mouth disease severely hampered that year's championship. As a result of this Cork were nominated to represent the province in the All-Ireland series and faced Dublin in the decider on 28 September 1941. A huge 5-11 to 0-6 victory gave Cork the All-Ireland title, their first in ten years. Barry-Murphy had no involvement with the team in 1942, however, he was back as a selector once again the following year. A 2-13 to 3-8 defeat of Waterford gave Cork the Munster crown, before later facing first-time finalists Antrim in the All-Ireland decider on 5 September 1943. The occasion seemed to unnerve the Glensmen as Cork built up an unassailable half-time lead. The final score of 5-16 to 0-4 gave Cork their second-ever hat-trick of All-Ireland titles. In 1944 Cork were attempting to capture a fourth All-Ireland title in-a-row. No team in the history of the hurling championship had won more than three consecutive titles. The year got off to a good start when Cork defeated Limerick by 4-6 to 3-6 after a replay of the provincial decider. For the third time in four years Cork faced Dublin in an All-Ireland decider. Joe Kelly was the hero of the day and he contributed greatly to Cork's 2-13 to 1-2 victory. It was a remarkable fourth successive All-Ireland title for Cork, Barry-Murphy's third as a selector. ==Biography== Born in Cloughduv, County Cork, Barry-Murphy was the second youngest child born to John and Katie Barry-Murphy. He was educated at the local national school before later boarding at St. Finbarr's College in Cork. Here he played on all the top college teams and enjoyed much success. Barry-Murphy later worked as an employer and director with the Cork Farmers Union ‚Äì a meat processing company. Dinny Barry-Murphy died on 21 August 1973 following a short illness. ==HonoursPlayer=== ;University College Cork *Fitzgibbon Cup (2): 1925, 1928 ;Cloughduv *Cork Intermediate Hurling Championship (1): 1941 *Cork Junior Hurling Championship (1): 1940 ;√âire √ìg *Cork Senior Hurling Championship (1): 1928 ;Cork *All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (4): 1926, 1928, 1929 (c), 1931 *Munster Senior Hurling Championship (5): 1926, 1927, 1928, 1929 (c), 1931 *National Hurling League (2): 1925-26, 1929-30 *All-Ireland Junior Hurling Championship (1): 1925 *Munster Junior Hurling Championship (2): 1923, 1925 ;Munster *Railway Cup (5): 1928, 1929, 1930 (c), 1931, 1934 ;Ireland * Tailteann Games (1): 1932 ===Selector=== ;Cork *All- Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (3): 1941, 1943, 1944 *Munster Senior Hurling Championship (2): 1943, 1944 ==References== Category:1903 births Category:1973 deaths Dinny Category:Cloughduv hurlers Category:UCC hurlers Category:√âire √ìg hurlers (Cork) Category:St. Finbarr's hurlers Category:Cork inter-county hurlers Category:Munster inter-provincial hurlers Category:All- Ireland Senior Hurling Championship winners Category:Hurling selectors ","title":"Dinny Barry-Murphy"},{"id":"9128755","text":"The Kia Kue was originally unveiled as a concept crossover SUV during the 2007 North American International Auto Show in Detroit.

' is a play of the third category by Kan'ami, revised by Zeami Motokiyo. One of the most highly regarded of Noh plays, it is mentioned more than any other in Zeami's own writings, and is depicted numerous times in the visual arts. ==Plot== The two main characters are the lingering spirits of the sisters and , who once lived on the Bay of Suma in Settsu Province, where they ladled brine in order to make salt. A courtier, Middle Counsellor Ariwara no Yukihira, dallied with them during his exile to Suma for three years. Shortly after his departure, word of his death came and they died of grief. They linger on as spirits or ghosts, attached to the mortal world by their sinful (according to Buddhist doctrine) emotional attachment to mortal desires; this is a common theme in Noh. The play opens with a traveling priest asking a local about a memorial he sees. The local explains that the memorial is to the two sisters. This is followed by a scene in which the sisters, ladling seawater into their brinecart at night, become fascinated by the sight of the moon in the water, and try to capture it. The priest dreams that he meets them when asking for lodgings. After revealing their identities, they explain their past, and grow overcome with their love and longing for Yukihira. Matsukaze, after donning the courtly hunting robe and hat left to her by the courtier, mistakes a pine for her love, and Murasame joins her briefly in madness, before recovering, passing on from the mortal world of emotional attachment, and leaving her sister behind. ==Sources and themes== Royall Tyler and other scholars attribute the bulk of the work to Zeami, claiming that it is based on a brief dance piece by his father Kan'ami. The play's contents allude strongly to elements of the Genji monogatari, particularly the chapters in which Hikaru Genji falls in love with a lady at Akashi and later (temporarily) leaves her. The early section written by Kan'ami quotes from the \\"Suma\\" chapter of the monogatari, the play's setting at Suma evokes these events and the theme of women of the shore who, after an affair with a high-ranking courtier, are left waiting for his return. The play also contains many allusions to the language of the monogatari, which would have been recognized by the poets of Zeami's day. The name of the chief character, and title of the play, Matsukaze, bears a poetic double meaning. Though Matsu can mean \\"pine tree\\" (Êùæ), it can also mean \\"to wait\\" or \\"to pine\\" (ÂæÖ„Å§). Matsukaze pines for the return of her courtier lover, like the woman of Akashi in the Genji, and like the woman in Zeami's play Izutsu. Tyler also draws a comparison between the names of the two sisters to a traditional element in Chinese poetry, referring to different strains of music as the Autumn Rain and the Wind in the Pines; Autumn Rain is strong and gentle intermittently, while the Wind in the Pines is soft and constant. Though the characters in the play actually represent the opposite traits ‚Äì Matsukaze alternating between strong emotional outbursts and gentle quietness while her sister remains largely in the background, and acts as a mediating influence upon Matsukaze ‚Äì the comparison is nevertheless a valid and interesting one. Finally, Tyler offers the idea that the two women are aspects of a single psyche, or that they are \\"purified essences of human feeling... twin voices of the music of longing\\" and not actually fully fleshed people. == Opera == Matsukaze became the subject of an opera by Japanese composer Toshio Hosokawa, written for the dance company of Sasha Waltz. It was commissioned by and first performed at Th√©√¢tre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels in 2011 It has been hailed as a triumph for contemporary opera and for the composer. The production toured to Warsaw, Luxemburg, Berlin and Lille. ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:Noh plays Category:Buddhist plays ","title":"Matsukaze"},{"id":"9128774","text":"South Atlantic High on the right. South Atlantic High is a semipermanent pressure high centered at about 25¬∞S, 15¬∞W, in the Atlantic Ocean. It is also called the St. Helena High, Saint Helena island being the only land in the area. It can stretch thousands of miles across the South Atlantic. This does not mean that the position and the intensity of this anticyclone are permanent, but just that we find an anticyclone on the maps describing the average monthly pressure. This area of high pressure is part of the great subtropical belt of anticyclones called the subtropical ridge. The centre of the high pressure region tends to follow the seasonal variation in position of the sun, moving south in the southern summer and north in the southern winter. This affects the climate of the adjacent continental areas, bringing seasonal changes to the climate and weather as the position of the high oscillates. ==Formation== Hadley cell transporting heat and humidity from the Tropics toward the mid-latitudes. In the Horse latitudes, generally in the region between 30 and 35 degrees of north and south latitude, there are more or less permanent highs. This is the subsiding part of Hadley cells. Indeed, near the equator, where the Coriolis force is quite weak, a direct circulation of air is established. In the lower levels of the atmosphere, the difference in temperature between the equator and the northerly warmer regions gives rise to the intertropical convergence zone where the warmer air rises because of convergence and relatively lower density. Subsequently, this air spreads north and south and cools at higher altitude and descends further north and south. ==Associated weather== This system greatly affects sailing because the associated winds are generally not strong and sailing vessels have to go far north or south of the centre of the high pressure region depending on the direction of travel to find winds that are favourable in strength and direction. ==Climatic influence== The anticyclonic circulation produces a dry climate, but its influence does not stop there: the South Atlantic High brings warm, beautiful weather from the east coast of South America to Africa in summer as it carries tropical air to its southern flank. On its northern flank, where the winds are easterly trade winds, there is the intertropical convergence zone that controls the African monsoon and the rainy season in the Guianas. ==References== ==External links== Category:Anticyclones Category:Atlantic Ocean Category:Regional climate effects Category:Climate of Argentina ","title":"South Atlantic High"},{"id":"9128802","text":"Canton of Marseille-La Capelette is a former canton located within the commune of Marseille in the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne department of France.

They folded in 1994 after suddenly losing their ground. ==History== It is thought that the club were founded in 1901 as Sholing Athletic and spent their early days playing in the Southampton League. In 1919‚Äì20 Sholing won the Senior League title and the first of three successive Southampton Senior Cups. This saw them step up into the Hampshire League where they promptly won the East Division title. Playing in the County Division (later to become Division 1) Sholing soon settled and after finishing 6th and 5th they proudly won the Hampshire Senior Cup but after two tough seasons the club finished bottom and returned to the less demanding Southampton League. Now known as simply Sholing the club soon re-established themselves as a force. The late Thirties were particularly successful times - in 1937‚Äì38 they were Senior League champions and Hampshire Intermediate Cup winners, the following season saw them retain the title and win the Southampton Senior Cup. After World War II the club became known as Sholing Sports and returned to the Hampshire League in 1946 when they were placed in Division 3 East. Back in county football, Sholing quickly settled and shortly after moving to their Birch Lawn home, they won promotion as champions in 1952‚Äì53 before consolidating themselves in Division 2. After some promising seasons, Sholing were promoted to Division 1 in 1961-62 but struggled and dropped straight back down again, and were surprisingly relegated back to Division 3 in 1964‚Äì65. The 1970s saw Sholing Sports become a prominent force in the Hampshire League. In 1969-70 they were Division 3 East champions and in 1971‚Äì72 they finished runners-up in Division 2, winning promotion back to the top flight - and this time they were far better prepared. Sholing quickly became one of the top clubs in the league and began entering the national competitions, the FA Cup and FA Vase. They enjoyed several good runs in the latter competition. In 1973‚Äì74 Sholing won their first Division 1 title as well as the Hampshire Senior Cup. The club remained regular title contenders, finishing runners-up three times before the incredible 1982‚Äì83 season when they were deservedly League champions - and they completed a remarkable treble by also winning the Hampshire Senior and Russell Cotes Cup's. The following season saw Sholing retain the league title, but were beaten finalists in the Hampshire Senior Cup. In 1984-85, Sholing were league runners-up and Hampshire Senior Cup finalists, but did gain some compensation when they again won the Russell Cotes Cup. For the 1986-87 campaign Sholing Sports became founder members of the newly formed Wessex League, and enjoyed a steady debut season as they reached the finals of the Southampton Senior Cup and the inaugural League Cup. The next few years saw the club continue to hold their own but in a more professional environment their fortunes gradually declined - not helped in the early 1990s by increasing uncertainty over their Birch Lawn ground, caused mainly by financial problems at the adjacent Social Club. Sholing Sports battled on until August 1993 when they were evicted from their ground - virtually on the eve of the new season and inevitably this unfortunately forced them to withdraw from the competition. The club continued to operate during the 1993-94 season with just an Under 18's side playing in the Hampshire Youth League but the search for a new home ground was unsuccessful and they inevitably folded. ==Honours== *Hampshire League Division 1 **Champions 1973/74, 1982/83 and 1983/84 **Runners-up 1974/75, 1975/76, 1981/82 and 1984/85 *Hampshire League Division 2 **Runners-up 1970/71 *Hampshire League East Division **Champions 1920/21 *Hampshire League Division 3 East **Champions 1952/53 and 1969/70 **Runners-up 1950/51 and 1968/69 *Southampton League Senior Division **Champions 1919/20, 1920/21, 1937/38 and 1938/39 *Southampton League Junior 'A' Division **Champions 1913/14 *Hampshire FA Senior Cup **Winners 1922/23, 1973/74 and 1982/83 **Finalists 1983/84 and 1984/85 *Hampshire FA Intermediate Cup **Winners 1937/38 *Hampshire FA Russell Cotes Cup **Winners 1971/72, 1982/83 and 1984/85 *Southampton FA Senior Cup **Winners 1919/20, 1920/21, 1921/22, 1938/39, 1961/62 and 1979/80 **Finalists 1986/87 *Wessex League Cup **Finalists 1986/87 ==Playing Records League === { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" style=text-align:center !Season !Division !Position !Significant events -

Like their predecessors, they originally played at Mayfield Park and began clawing their way up through the Junior ranks. By 2009 they had reached the Senior section and were using the Royal Victoria Country Park in Netley for their home matches, but sadly after a tough 2010-11 season the club again ceased to exist. In 2010, successful local rivals VTFC (Vosper Thornycroft) changed their name to Sholing FC in a bid to attract more local support but they are not connected in any way to Sholing Sports, who remain consigned to the history books and sorely missed. ==Famous Players== Over the years many fine players appeared for Sholing Sports. In the early twenties two players moved on to professional clubs; Tom Parker who progressed on to Southampton and the legendary Arsenal team of the thirties and also Sam Meston, who played for Southampton, Gillingham and Everton. Latterly, they had two former professionals as player-managers - Jack Gregory (former Southampton, Bournemouth and Leyton Orient) for the 1965-66 season, and also Tommy Hare (former Southampton and Luton Town) for the 1976-77 campaign. ==References== * * Category:Defunct football clubs in England Category:Association football clubs established in 1901 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 1994 Category:1901 establishments in England Category:1994 disestablishments in England Category:2005 establishments in England Category:Association football clubs established in 2005 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 2011 Category:2011 disestablishments in England Category:Defunct football clubs in Hampshire ","title":"Sholing Sports F.C."},{"id":"9128869","text":"The O2 Ritz (originally known as The Ritz) is a live music venue on Whitworth Street West, Manchester, England.

He began his career in Tokyo sumo at the Tomozuna stable, joining in May 1891 at the age of 15. He reached the top makuuchi division in 1896, peaking at maegashira 7. He was very popular with geisha, but his interest in this side of life caused his progress in sumo to slacken. In addition, he suffered from smallpox. He left in January 1898, joining Osaka sumo, and entering Nakamura stable. It is believed he was awarded the Osaka sumo yokozuna licence by the Gojo family in January 1903 though the evidence is obscure. In June 1903, he fought against wrestlers in Tokyo sumo. He gave a very strong performance, defeating yokozuna Umegatani T≈çtar≈ç II and emerged as a threat to the dominance of the strongest yokozuna in Tokyo sumo, Hitachiyama. His strength was acknowledged when, after a series of meetings between the Osaka and Tokyo sumo associations, he was awarded a yokozuna license by the Yoshida family in April 1905.

It is the calcium salt of phosphorylethanolamine. It was discovered by the eminent biochemist Erwin Chargaff in 1941. Ca-AEP has been shown to help maintain cell membrane integrity and improve cellular functions. It was patented by Hans Alfred Nieper and Franz Kohler. ==Terminology and glossary== Calcium 2-amino ethyl phosphoric acid (Ca-AEP or Ca-2AEP) is also called calcium ethylamino- phosphate (calcium EAP), calcium colamine phosphate, calcium 2-aminoethyl ester of phosphoric acid, and calcium 2-amino ethanol phosphate 2-AEP plays a role as a component in the cell membrane and at the same time has the property to form complexes with minerals. This mineral transporter goes into the outer layer of the outer cell membrane where it releases its associated mineral and is itself metabolized with the structure of the cell membrane. The effect here is an increase of the electrical condenser function of cell membranes to resist toxins and viruses which may otherwise enter the cell and cause cellular degeneration. Calcium 2-AEP is said to be effective for repairing cell membrane damage. In Germany, calcium, potassium and magnesium 2-AEP are officially declared as the only active substances for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. ==History, treatments, uses, and risks== Ca-AEP was discovered by Erwin Chargaff, best known for his work that eventually led to the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA, in 1953. The U.S. National Multiple Sclerosis Society states that ‚Äúcalcium EAP protocol is not recommended by the Medical Advisory Board of the National MS Society.‚Äù The National MS Society warns of side effects and risk, but they do not list any on their website for this treatment. They do state that it ‚Äúmay include a powerful drug that suppresses the immune system‚Äù but they do not mention what this drug is.

They are currently considered the fifth group up on the comb of branching events in the extant lepidopteran phylogeny (Kristensen and Skalski, 1999: 10). They also represent the most basal lineage in the lepidopteran group Coelolepida (Wiegmann et al., 2002) (along with Lophocoronoidea and the massive group \\"Myoglossata\\") characterised in part by its scale morphology (Kristensen, 1999: 53-54). Moths in this superfamily are usually small (but one is 15 mm. in wingspan) and iridescent. Like other \\"homoneurous\\" Coelolepida and non-ditrysian Heteroneura, the ocelli are lost. There are variety of unique structural characteristics (see Kristensen, 1999: 53-54 for an overview). There are two described genera of these primitive moths. Catapterix was originally described within its own family (Sinev, 1988) but Acanthopteroctetes shares with it a number of specialised structural features including similar wing morphology (in A. unifascia) (Nielsen and Kristensen, 1996: 1255). ==Distribution== Four species of Acanthoctesia in the genus Acanthopteroctetes are very localised in Western North America (Davis, 1978). Another genus, Catapterix represented by a single species comes from single sites at \\"Mount Karadag\\" and \\"Krasnolesie\\" in the Crimean Peninsula of the Ukraine (Zagulajev and Sinev, 1988). A third taxon, undescribed, is known from the Andes in Peru (Kristensen, 1999: 54). ==Biology== Acanthopteroctetes are leaf-miners on the shrub genus Ceanothus (Rhamnaceae) (Kristensen, 1999: 53-54). The mine is a blotch on the leaf, overwintering as a larva, with the pupa in a cocoon on the ground (Kristensen, 1999). The adult moths, diurnal, emerge in the spring. The biology of Catapterix is however unknown. ==Conservation== These primitive moths must be considered high conservation priorities on the grounds that the genera are both evolutionarily highly distinctive and have very narrow ranges (Nielsen and Kristensen, 1996). Catapterix crimaea, apparently unreported more or less since its description (Zagulajev and Sinev, 1988; Zagulajev, 1992) on this basis must be one of the top priorities in Europe for conservation surveys or monitoring. ==References== * Davis, D.

His league and championship career with the Cork senior team spanned thirteen seasons from 1919 until 1931. Born in Cork, Coughlan was raised in a strong hurling family. His father as well as several of his paternal and maternal uncles all won All-Ireland medals with Cork in the early years of the championship. Coughlan first played competitive hurling with the Blackrock club, making his senior debut in 1918. In a hugely successful club career, he lined out in twelve county finals, winning seven county senior championship medals. After impressing on the club scene, Coughlan came to prominence at inter-county level at the age of nineteen when he was added to the Cork senior panel in 1919. Over the course of the next thirteen seasons he won five All- Ireland medals, beginning with a lone triumph as a non-playing substitute in his debut season, three championship titles in four seasons between 1926 and 1929 and a fifth and final winners' medal as captain of the team in 1931. Coughlan also won seven Munster medals and two National Hurling League medals. He played his last game for Cork in November 1931. Coughlan was joined on the Cork team by his brother, John. After being chosen on the Munster inter- provincial team for the first time in 1928, Coughlan was an automatic choice on the starting fifteen for a number of years until 1932. During that time he won three Railway Cup medals. Even during his playing days Coughlan came to be recognised as one of the greatest players of all time. In 1985 he was the recipient of the GAA's All-Time All-Star Award, while he was posthumously named in the right wing-forward position on the Cork Hurling Team of the Century in 2000. ==Early life== Eugene 'Eudie' Coughlan (pronounced Cawlan) was born in Blackrock, just outside Cork in 1899. He was born into a family that was steeped in the hurling tradition of the area. Coughlan's father, Pat, was the eldest of the family and won back-to-back All-Ireland titles in 1893 and 1894. His uncles included Denis 'Lyonsie' Coughlan, Jer Coughlan, Dan Coughlan and Tom 'Honest Man' Coughlan who all played with 'the Rockies' and claimed All-Ireland titles with Cork. Coughlan's mother's maiden name was Dorney. Her brothers were also both prominent in Blackrock and Cork hurling circles. All of Coughlan's family earned their livelihoods as fishermen. As a youngster he rowed a boat on the River Lee, picked mussels and prepared them for dispatch to Liverpool. Coughlan later worked with the Ford Motor Company, the workplace of many Cork All-Ireland medal winners, before finding a job with the Cork Harbour Board.Captains of the Ash p. 144 ==Playing careerClub=== Coughlan carried on the tradition of his father and uncles and played his club hurling with the famous Blackrock club. He enjoyed much success. Coughlan lined out in his first county final in 1918, however, 'the Rockies' were defeated by Carrigtwohill. It was the first of nine consecutive final appearances for the Blackrock club. The following year Coughlan's club made the final once again, however, on that occasion it was the St. Finbarr's club who triumphed. In 1920 Coughlan won his first senior county title as Fairhill were defeated in the final. The championship was suspended in 1921, however, Coughlan's side were back in the finals of 1922 and 1923. On both occasions the team was beaten by 'the Barr's.' Coughlan added two more county victories to his collection in 1924 and 1925, however, St. Finbarr's caught Blackrock in the final of 1926. The following year Coughlan won his fourth county medal. Blackrock failed to reach the final in 1928, however, in 1929 he won his fifth county title. It was the first of three-in-a-row for Coughlan, bringing his county medal tally to seven. The 1931 final victory was Coughlan's last big occasion with Blackrock. The club would not win another county title until 1956. ===Inter-county=== Coughlan first came to the attention of the Cork hurling selectors in 1919 when Blackrock played a Cork selection in a game in aid of Republican prisoners. Later that same year he was a non-playing substitute on the Cork team that defeated Dublin to win the All-Ireland final. The following year Coughlan was still a member of the substitute's bench when Cork won the Munster title. He did line out in the subsequent All-Ireland final with Dublin providing the opposition once again. In a close game 'the Dubs' avenged the defeat of 1919 by winning on a score line of 4‚Äì9 to 4‚Äì3. Cork were defeated in the provincial championship for the next few seasons as Limerick and Tipperary came to dominate the competition. In the winter and spring of 1925‚Äì1926 the inaugural National Hurling League was played. Coughlan's side reached the final of that competition and defeated Dublin, giving Coughlan, and his brother John, his first major victory. Cork later proved themselves by reaching the Munster final. Tipperary were the opponents on that occasion and took a 1‚Äì2 to 0‚Äì0 lead. At that point the game was abandoned and a replay was ordered. The second game was a much tighter affair with both sides finishing level on a score line of 4‚Äì1 to 3‚Äì4. The third game was also a close affair, however, Cork pulled through to win by 3‚Äì6 to 2‚Äì4, giving Coughlan his first Munster title on the field of play. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Cork against Kilkenny at a snow-covered Croke Park in October of that year. Coughlan's side took the lead at half-time and held on to win by 4‚Äì6 to 2‚Äì0. It was Cork's first championship title since 1919 and Coughlan's first All-Ireland medal on the field of play.The GAA Book of Lists p. 344 Cork retained their Munster title in 1927 with a 5‚Äì3 to 3‚Äì4 victory over Clare. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Cork take on Dublin once again. Cork fell behind by 2‚Äì3 to 0‚Äì1 at half-time; however, they fought back in the second-half. In a team made up of nine members of the Garda S√≠och√°na 'the Dubs' claimed the victory by 4‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì3.The GAA Book of Lists p. 344 In 1928 Cork faced Clare in the Munster final for the second year in-a- row. That game ended in a draw, however, in the replay Cork triumphed with Coughlan collecting his third consecutive Munster title. Cork later defeated Dublin in the All-Ireland semi-final before lining out against Galway in the championship decider. Galway got a bye into the final without picking up a hurley, however, the game turned into a rout. A score line of 6‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì0 gave Cork the victory and gave Coughlan a second All-Ireland medal.The GAA Book of Lists p. 345 1928 also saw Coughlan lining out with the Irish Hurling Team in the Tailteann Games, Ireland's answer to the Olympic Games.The GAA Book of Lists p. 273 In 1929 Cork retained their provincial dominance for a fourth consecutive year. A 4‚Äì6 to 2‚Äì3 defeat of Waterford gave Coughlan his fourth Munster title in four years. The subsequent All-Ireland final was a replay of the previous year's game as Cork played Galway once again. Mick Ahern scored a goal for Cork after just 25 seconds to start another rout. Cork won the day by 4‚Äì9 to 1‚Äì3 giving Coughlan his third All-Ireland title.The GAA Book of Lists p. 345 In 1930 Coughlan was appointed captain of the Cork senior hurling team. That year he won a second National League title, however, Cork surrendered their provincial crown later that summer. The team bounced back in 1931 with Coughlan, who was still the captain of the side, collecting a fifth Munster winners' medal. Once again it took a replay for Cork and Waterford to be separated. The All-Ireland final saw Cork take on Kilkenny for the first time since 1926. After a close game both sides finished level ‚Äì 1‚Äì6 apiece. Coughlan played a captain's role in that game as he scored a point from his knees to level the scores. The replay of the final took place four weeks later and is regarded as a classic. Cork took the lead at half-time, however, Kilkenny fought back. Once again both sides finished level ‚Äì 2‚Äì5 apiece. After this game officials pressed for extra time, however, Coughlan, as Cork captain, rejected this. It was also suggested at a meeting of the GAA's Central Council that both counties be declared joint champions and that half an All-Ireland medal by given to each player. This motion was later defeated.Captains of the Ash p. 143 The first week of November saw the second replay of the All-Ireland final take place. Coughlan gave his best-ever performance in that game. At the third attempt Cork triumphed by 5‚Äì8 to 3‚Äì4 giving Coughlan his fourth All-Ireland medal. At the beginning of 1932 Coughlan took umbrage at the actions of the Cork County Board in taking from his club, Blackrock, the selection of the Cork senior hurling team for the upcoming year. Coughlan, although in line to retain the captaincy, retired from inter-county hurling in protest at the relatively young age of 31.Captains of the Ash p. 144 ===Provincial=== Coughlan also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He first played for his province in the second year of the Railway Cup competition in 1928. On that occasion he collected his first winners' medal as Munster defeated Leinster. Coughlan remained on the team and helped Munster to capture further titles in 1929 and 1931. He was appointed captain in 1932, however, Munster were defeated by Leinster. ==Post-playing career== In retirement from the game Coughlan came to be recognised as one of the greatest players of all-time. In 1961 he was selected, by popular opinion, as a wing-forward on a Gael-Linn sponsored \\"Best Ever Team\\". At the 1984 All-Ireland Hurling Final he received a great welcome when he was presented to the crowd during the celebrations to mark the centenary of the Gaelic Athletic Association. At the time Coughlan, who was in his 85th year, was the oldest-living captain of an All-Ireland- winning senior hurling team. Just before the game he was presented to the crowd along with such hurling greats as Jack Lynch, Eddie Keher and Jimmy Doyle. The following year Coughlan was presented with the GAA All-Time All- Star Award. Eudie Coughlan died on 4 January 1987. He was posthumously honoured in 2000 when he was named in the right wing-forward position on the Cork Hurling Team of the Century. ==HonoursBlackrock=== *Cork Senior Hurling Championship: **Winner (7): 1920, 1924, 1925, 1927, 1929, 1930, 1931 **Runner-up (5): 1918, 1919, 1922, 1923, 1926 ===Cork=== *All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship: **Winner (4): 1926, 1928, 1929, 1931 **Runner-up (2): 1920, 1927 *Munster Senior Hurling Championship: **Winner (5): 1926, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1931 **Runner-up (1): 1921, *National Hurling League: **Winner (2): 1925‚Äì1926, 1929‚Äì1930 **Runner-up (1): 1928‚Äì1929 ===Munster=== *Railway Cup: **Winner (3): 1928, 1929, 1931 **Runner-up (1): 1932 ==Sources== * Corry, Eoghan, The GAA Book of Lists (Hodder Headline Ireland, 2005). * Fullam, Brendan, Captains of the Ash (Wolfhound Press, 2002). ==References== Category:1900 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Blackrock hurlers Category:Cork inter-county hurlers Category:Munster inter-provincial hurlers Category:All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship winners Category:Hurling selectors ","title":"Eudie Coughlan"},{"id":"9129019","text":"\\"Gedenktafel Synagoge Weener\\" in der Westerstra√üe 32; with citation from Psalm 74:7: \\"They have set Thy sanctuary on fire; they have profaned the dwelling- place of Thy name even to the ground.\\" Psalm 74 (Greek numbering: 73) is part of the Biblical Book of Psalms.

Born in Blackrock, Cork, Cashman first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Cork minor team before later joining the junior side. He joined the senior team during the 1951 championship. Cashman went on to enjoy a decade-long inter-county career and won two Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Cashman won six Railway Cup medals. At club level he won two championship medals with Blackrock. His brother-in-law, Jimmy Brohan, was a contemporary on the Cork hurling team, while his sons, Tom and Jim, enjoyed All-Ireland success with Cork. His grandson, Niall Cashman, currently plays with Cork. Throughout his career Cashman made 17 championship appearances. His retirement came following the conclusion of the 1962 championship. ==Playing careerClub=== In 1956 Cashman was captain of the Blackrock senior hurling team that reached the final of the county championship. A 2-10 to 2-2 defeat of northside kingpins Glen Rovers gave Cashmna his first championship medal. After losing to the same opposition in 1959, Blackrock reached the decider once again in 1961. Cashman was cpatin for a second time as the Rockies defeated divisional side Avondhu by 4-10 to 3-7. ===Inter-county=== Cashman first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork senior team in the early 1950s. After Tom Mulcahy retired from inter- county hurling after the 1951 championship Cashman became Cork's new goalkeeper. Success, however, was slow in coming. In 1952 Cashman was struck down with tonsilitis just before the start of the championship and was forced to withdraw from the starting fifteen. Former sub 'keeper Dave Creedon was recalled and proved so effective in goal that he succeeded in displacing Cashman as the first-choice goalkeeper for a number of years. There was some success for Cashman. He came on as a substitute in the 1953 league final as Cork defeated Tipperary to take the National Hurling League title. He was still relegated to the subs' bench for the subsequent championship campaign. In 1954 Tipperary fell to Cork by 2-8 to 1-8 in the provincial final. Cashman played as a half-back in that game to collect his first Munster title on the field of play.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 25 He played no part in Cork's subsequent All-Ireland final victory. Cork lost their provincial crown in 1955 and Dave Creedon retired from inter-county hurling. This opened the door for Cashman to return as first-choice goalkeeper for the following year. In 1956 Cork reached the Munster final once again. Limerick provided the opposition on that occasion, however, Cork recorded a 5-5 o 3-5 victory. It was Cashman's second Munster winners' medal on the field of play.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 25 Cork later lined out in the All-Ireland final with Wexford providing the opposition. The game has gone down in history as one of the all-time classic games as Christy Ring was bidding for a record ninth All-Ireland medal. The game turned on one important incident as the Wexford goalkeeper, Art Foley, made a miraculous save from a Ring shot and cleared the sliotar up the field to set up another attack. Wexford went on to win the game on a score line of 2-14 to 2-8 and Cashman wa sleft with a runners-up medal. In 1957 Cashman was appointed captain of his native-county‚Äôs senior hurling team. Once again Cork reached the Munster final, however, they were defeated by Waterford on a score line of 1-11 to 1-6.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 25 Cashman‚Äôs side contested three consecutive provincial finals in 1959, 1960 and 1961, however, he ended up on the losing side on every occasion.The Complete Handbook of Gaelic Games p. 25 He served as captain of the team again in 1962, however, he retired from inter-county hurling following Cork‚Äôs early exit from the championship. ===Inter- provincial=== Cashman also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition and enjoyed much success. He first lined out with his province as captain in 1957 and guided Munster to a 5-7 to 2-5 victory over Leinster. This was the first of five consecutive Railway Cup victories for Cashman a spart of the Munster team. He won a sixth and final Railway Cup winners' medal in 1963 as Munster accounted for Leinster by just a single point. ==Post-playing career== In retirement from hurling Cashman came to be regarded as one of Cork‚Äôs greatest players never to win an All-Ireland medal. Although he never achieved this distinction himself he did live to see his two sons have much success on the hurling field with both Blackrock and Cork. In 1986 both Jim and Tom Cashman won senior All-Ireland medals with Cork.

Published by The Breedon Books Publishing Company Limited. () was a Benedictine monastic institution in Colchester, Essex, founded in 1095.Crummy, Philip (1997) City of Victory; the story of Colchester - Britain's first Roman town. Published by Colchester Archaeological Trust () It was dissolved in 1539. ==HistoryFounding=== The site of the Abbey, to the south of the walled part of the town near the road to Mersea Island, was originally the location of a Saxon church dedicated to either St John the Baptist or St John the Evangelist. This church was supposedly where \\"miraculous voices\\" could be heard. The Saxon church was excavated in the 1970s, and was revealed to be a three celled structure built from Roman rubble. Originally it was thought that the church began life as a Late Roman martyrium,Thomas, C (1981) ‚ÄúChristianity in Roman Britain to AD 500‚Äù. Published by Battisford although it was later concluded that this was an error based on the fact that the church had been built on a former Roman cemetery, rather than as part of it. The final priest of the church was a man called Siric or Sigeric at the time of the Domesday Survey. Following the Norman conquest of England in 1066 the town eventually came into the possession of Eudo Dapifer, steward of William I and King William II. Eudo claimed to have witnessed a miracle at St John's Church in 1095, and used this as an excuse to found a Benedictine monastery on the site. He obtained the support of the Bishop of London in 1096, and began work on the monastery to the north of the original church. The outline of the building was marked on the ground on the 29 August 1096, and construction took place between 1096 and 1115, with Eudo himself supposedly laying the first stone. The Abbey and its associated buildings would have been constructed out of Roman rubble quarried from the ruins of Roman Colchester, and lime kilns, used to create lime for mortar from baking oyster shells, have been found which would have been used by the builders. As Eudo was a layman he had no authority to found an Abbey, and so it was a priory in its early years. The first attempt to populate the monastery came when the Bishop of Rochester sent two monks from his diocese to the town, but they subsequently returned and were replaced by a larger contingent under the leadership of a man called Ralph. Ralph negotiated with Eudo the extent of the monastery's authority in the town, becoming its first Prior, although he and his monks later left after a dispute. Eudo despaired of the project, until he met with Abbot Stephen of York, who sent thirteen monks to Colchester from York, which roughly coincided with Pope Paschal II's granting of abbey status to the institution on 10 January 1104. The leader of the monks from York, Hugh, was ordained as the first Abbot of St John's Abbey by the Bishop of London. Upon Eudo‚Äôs death in 1120 on his estate at Pr√©aux in Normandy his remains were brought to England to be interred at the Abbey on 28 February 1120. ===Medieval History=== St Giles church, the parish church for the Abbey's lay community. Heavily damaged during the 1648 Siege of Colchester. The Abbey suffered a disaster in its early years, when a large fire in 1133, which burned much of Colchester, severely affected the monastery. Following the destruction caused by the fire major reconstruction occurred. This involved landscaping much of the area around the Abbey, moving the officine (offices) and habitula (monks quarters) from the north side of the Abbey to the south side, and rebuilding the Abbey itself in a cruciform layout. As the Abbey building was forbidden to lay worshippers a parish church, St Giles's Church, was built to serve them sometime between 1133 and 1171. This replaced St John's Church as the parish church, which was demolished down to its foundations and covered by the spoil from the landscaping. The Church of St Giles was built to the north of the Abbey on the early lay burial ground, which included many graves lined with Roman rubble. Sometime around 1170 the monastery received a vial of St Thomas Becket's blood from a monk called Ralph, who had once stayed at of St John's Abbey during Becket's exile, and who had been present at Becket's murder in Canterbury. Supposedly Ralph only caught a few drops of Becket's blood in the vial, but when he sent it to Colchester it was miraculously overflowing. This vial became the Abbey's most treasured relic, with supernatural healing powers attributed to it. King Henry III gave the Abbey 15 oaks for upgrading the building in 1235. The Abbey was embroiled in long standing disputes with the townspeople of Colchester throughout the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries, as well as several sometimes violent confrontations with the Augustinian convent of St. Botolph's Priory which stood across the road from it. In 1253, following long standing dispute over access to the free warren in West Donyland, to the south of the town, and the extent of the Abbot's jurisdiction, a group of forty Colchester men attacked and destroyed the Abbey's gallows and tumbrels at Greenstead to the East of the town, before cutting the ropes of the Abbey‚Äôs ships at Brightlingsea. By 1255 these particular disagreements were settled, although in 1270 the king had to order the abbot to desist from distraining the Colchester men in matters of trespass of bread and ale, as it was outside of his jurisdiction. An anti-Abbey riot broke out at the Midsummers Fair in 1272 on St John's Green outside of the Abbey, and the following day the monks showed the Colchester coroner a dead body on the Green, purportedly one of their number killed by the townspeople. The subsequent investigation, however, found that the body was of a criminal taken down from the town gallows and placed on the Green by the monks in an attempt to defame the burgesses of Colchester. In 1310 an episcopal visit by Bishop Baldock found the Abbey's monks had fallen slack in observing the rules regarding the periods of silence, abstinence from consuming meat (except in times of illness) and stabilitas (which stated that Benedictine monks may not move from their monastery to other ones). The Abbey found itself in trouble with the Crown in 1346, when a French prisoner, Berengar de Monte Alto, said to be the archdeacon of Paris, who had been captured at the Battle of Cr√©cy by the English was sold in England for ¬£50. He came into the possession of the abbot, who sold him in London, in direct defiance of the king's writ ordering his detention. In the winter of 1348-49 the Black Death struck the town, killing up to 1,500 people including the Abbot and Prior of St John's Abbey by the time it began to die down in August 1349.Denney, Patrick (2004) Colchester. Published by Tempus Publishing () The Abbey had pleaded poverty in the 14th century in order abstain from obligations to the King. A conflict arose with the nearby St. Botolph's Priory, reported by the abbot to the pope, that the canons of St Botolph's, with two hundred supporters, attacked a monk of the abbey called Thomas Stuckele, whilst laying siege to the abbey. Some of them had forced their way inside, and injured the abbot and convent. The cause of the riot is not stated, but it may have arisen through a dispute about a pension out of the church of St Peter's, in Colchester, which was settled the following year. The Abbey suffered attacks from rebels during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. The rebels who had assembled in Colchester had marched south to join Wat Tyler on the 14 June, whilst those who stayed behind attacked the town's Moot Hall and St John's Abbey on 15 and 16 June, forcing the law courts to shut for five weeks, and carrying off the court rolls of the Abbey. Following the attack by the disgruntled rebels on the Abbey its walls and gatehouse were strengthened. Further conflict involving St John's occurred when twelve armed horsemen from the Abbey were involved in a fight with townspeople outside of Colkynge's Castle (modern Balkerne Gate on the western walls of Colchester) in 1391 over grazing rights to the meadows in the area. The following year in 1392 the Abbot and his supporters got into a fight with his own monks, which spilled over onto St John's Green outside of the Abbey Gate. In 1396, a monk of the abbey, John Colschestre was appointed bishop of Orkney by Pope Boniface IX, who on 25 February 1399 also granted the abbots of Colchester the use of the mitre and permission to gives solemn blessings at the end of mass and vespers. However the abbot during this time was frequently reprimanded for mismanagement of the Abbey. In 1404 the Abbot, alongside other leading Colcestrians and the Abbot of St Osyth's Priory, were charged with being part of an earlier conspiracy to put the deposed Richard II back on Henry IV's throne. Although the Abbot was acquitted in 1405, the case led to several leading burgesses of Colchester taking legal actions against him, all of which were resolved by 1415. King Henry V later censured the Abbey for building a tower in defence of the monastery on Royal land. In 1429 and 1430, during a dispute with the townsfolk over the ownership of the Hythe water mill at Colchester's port, the Abbot of St John's called the town a nest of Lollards, intending it as an insult, and claimed that the town owed St John's ¬£228 in arrears over payments for the Abbey infirmary. However it was the Abbot who had to pay arrears for failing alongside his predecessors of the last 130 years to find a chaplain to celebrate mass on three days in each week in St Helen's chapel in the town, something they should have done in accordance with a judgment of 1290. The Abbey, which harboured strong pro- Plantagenet feelings, became embroiled in the politics surrounding the Wars of the Roses. In the 1460s the Abbey had close links with John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk, Constable of Colchester Castle and a supporter of the Yorkist cause. Howard interfered with the abbatial elections following the death of Abbot Ardeley in 1464, helping John Canon to win the election. Howard then appears to have interfered again in support of Abbot Stansted's election following Canon's death in 1464, both suspecting of being pro-Yorkist. During the brief restoration of the House of Lancaster in 1470-71 Howard took advantage of the Abbey's charter-enshrined sanctuary status by taking refuge there. Richard III had visited Colchester several times in the 15th century, in 1467/68, staying at the pro-Yorkist St John's Abbey each time. Following the Plantagenet defeat at the Battle of Bosworth Field the abbey provided a sanctuary for Yorkists, including briefly Viscount Lovell and perhaps also Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York.Baldwin, D. (2007) The Lost Prince. Published by Stroud The Abbey's sympathies were remembered in the early Tudor period by Edward IV and Richard III's mother Cecily Neville who left a large sum to the Abbey in her will. ===Dissolution=== Following the Tudor victory in the Wars of the Roses King Henry VII appears to have viewed the Abbey with suspicion, although he stayed there during his visit to Colchester. Catherine of Aragon also stayed at the Abbey during her visit to the town in 1515. Following Henry VIII's divorce of Catherine, he began the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536. Already in 1534 schisms within the Abbey between supporters of the king and detractors, although the Abbey survived the initial dissolutions thanks to the intervention of Thomas Audley, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. However, St John's Abbey was dissolved in 1539, following the trial and execution of the Abbey's last Abbot, John Beche (alias Thomas Marshall). Abbot Beche had refused to hand the Abbey over to the King, and so was taken to the Tower of London before facing a trial in Colchester in front of a jury headed by the Earl of Essex. After being found guilty of treason he was hanged on his own demesne lands at Colchester on 1 December 1539. His pectoral cross was rescued by the Mannock Family of Stoke-by-Nayland in Suffolk, who gave it to Buckfast Abbey in Devon. The Abbey monks were granted small pensions, whilst the Abbey itself fell into the hands of the crown. ===Post Dissolution=== The gatehouse of St John's Abbey, Colchester Following the dissolution the Abbey was leased by the crown to Sir Thomas Darcy, before eventually being bought by the Lucas Family in 1548.Crummy, Nina; Crummy, Philip; and Crossan, Carl (1993) Colchester Archaeological Report 9: Excavations of Roman and later cemeteries, churches and monastic sites in Colchester, 1971-88. Published by Colchester Archaeological Trust () The Abbey church was slowly demolished during the late 16th century and early 17th century, with the Lucas family building a large manor house in its grounds, retaining the precinct wall with its large Abbey Gate around the old grounds. St Giles's Church was retained as a parish church, housing the tombs of the Lucas family. Fragments of the Abbey were reused in Bourne Mill (built 1597), whilst other fragments of stone from the church are scattered around the former grounds. Depictions of Colchester on John Speed's map of 1607 show the Lucas mansion in the southern part of the Abbey grounds and what appears to be the central tower of the Abbey with its lantern window on top still standing. In 1648, during the English Civil War, Colchester was seized by Royalist forces and besieged by the Parliamentarians. Sir Charles Lucas, one of the Royalist commanders, was a native of the Lucas manor in the Abbey grounds. As part of the siege of the town the Parliamentarians ejected the Royalist troops from the Abbey grounds after a long fight, destroying the Lucas mansion, St Giles's Church, parts of the old Abbey precinct walls and parts of the Abbey Gate in the process. In 1860 the War Office bought the Abbey grounds from the Baring family, and it became part of Colchester Garrison. The Abbey Fields, south of the old Abbey precinct and once part of the garrison grounds, still bear the name of the Abbey. The Abbey church building was rediscovered during excavations in 2010 by Colchester Archaeological Trust.The Colchester Archaeologist. Issue no. 24. (2011) (ISSN 0952-0988) In these excavations the church was found to have been much larger than expected at 90m long, longer than the nearby St. Botolph's Priory. ==The Monastic InstitutionThe Abbey Church=== Colchester in 1500AD, showing the location of the Abbey of St John's The Abbey church was rediscovered in 2010 but many of the associated buildings have yet to be identified archaeologically, although contemporary descriptions and images of the Abbey have allowed some reconstruction of the church. The Abbey church was cruciform in layout, with two western towers and a squat central tower over the central crossing of the transepts, topped by a large cylindrical roof lantern. It had about seven bays (pairs of arches on either side of the nave, and a least two chapels attached to the south side of the building. The church contained a clock, one of two in Medieval Colchester, the second being at St Leonards-at-the-Hythe. The church contained an image of The Blessed Virgin Mary, with a sanctuary lamp, and a relic consisting of a vial of Thomas Becket's blood. The Abbey church and associated buildings, such as the Abbot's residence and chapter house, were located within a walled precinct which enclosed an area of roughly 13 acres. Sections of this wall remain along Mersea Road, although large portions were pulled down in the 1970s. The precinct wall enclosed the site of the north, east and west sides, with the south side apparently open to the countryside. The main entrance into the precinct from St John's Green was the Abbey Gate, which still stands and is a Grade I listed building. The parish church of St Giles's Church, which served the lay community around the church, was located in its own precinct attached to the north of the main precinct. St Giles's was heavily damaged during fighting in the 1648 Siege of Colchester, but was rebuilt and is now Colchester's Mason centre. The head of the Abbey was an Abbot, assisted by a Prior. From 1399 the Abbot was permitted to wear a mitre, and sat in the House of Lords. The seal of the Abbey is circular, with a diameter of 3 inches, and has the following appearance: The obverse represents St John the Baptist seated in a canopied niche, holding in his left hand the Agnus Dei on aplaque, whilst pointing to it with his right hand. In smaller canopied niches on the left and right are Saints Peter and Paul. In the base is a shield of the arms of the abbey‚Äîa cross within a bordure, over all an escarbuncle of eight stavesfleury. The Legend reads SIGILLUM COMUNE MONASTERII SANCTIIOHIS BAPTISTE COLCESTRIE. The reverse represents St John the Evangelist seated in a canopied niche, holding in his right hand a chalice with a dragon, and in his left hand a palm branch. In canopied niches to either side are angels. Outside these on either side is a penthouse, on which is an angel holding out a shield of arms; on the left those of France and England quartered, and on the right those of the abbey. In the base under an arch is an abbot kneeling, with figures in niches on each side. The Legend on the reverse reads O MATRIS . . . ALNE IOHS CONSERBES OMESCCIB[UD] . . . ATQ . . . DS. ===Possessions=== The lands and endowments of the Abbey were recorded and confirmed in several charters. The first charter from 1104 confirms the possession of the manors of Weeley and Pitsea, a four-day fair at the feast of St John at Colchester, the churches of Turnecruft, at Leatherhead in Surrey, and St Mary Woolchurch, in London, various other lands and tithes, and grants by other donors. In addition the charter granted that the abbey shall have the same liberties as Westminster. A second charter in 1119 confirms a further list of possessions, the principal additions being the manor of Mundon and the church of Nieweseles, in Barkway, Hertfordshire. A charter from the reign of William II confirms the grants made by Eudo to the Abbey, and mentions the manors of Brightlingsea, Weeley and Great Hallingbury, and the churches of Lillechurch, St Mary Woolchurch, and Leatherhead. However the grants may have been partially revoked at a later date, as Brightlingsea and Hallingbury are not mentioned in the charters of Henry I. The church of Lillechurch remained in the possession of the Abbey until the reign of King Stephen, when it was exchanged for lands in East Donyland, to the south of Colchester. The chapel of St Helen at Colchester along with a fair of two days at the feast of the Invention of the Cross were granted to the Abbey by Henry II. Other manors granted to the Abbey included Wickham Skeith, in Suffolk, Greenstead manor and church (now part of Colchester), Little Bardfield, Ardleigh, Boxted, Berechurch (now part of Colchester), the churches of St Giles, St Leonard, St Nicholas and HolyTrinity in Colchester, East Donyland, Takeley, StStephen Walbrook in London, Walkern in Hertfordshire, Hamerton in Huntingdonshire, Aldeburgh and Hemingstone in Suffolk, and St George, Norwich. The Abbey also owned Bourne Mill, a water mill on a brook just to the south of Colchester. A small cell of the Abbey was founded at Writtle called Bedemannesberg by a monk called Robert, and Henry II confirmed the Abbey's possession and granted various privileges, including the right to gather nuts in the forest round, under the condition that two monks should dwell perpetually in the hermitage to pray for the safety of the king and the souls of dead kings. A second cell existed at Snape Priory near Aldeburgh, which was granted to the Abbey on the agreement that there should be a prior and monks, who should be under the obedience of the Abbey and render to it a yearly pension of half a mark. The abbot was to visit the priory twice a year with twelve horses for a stay of four days, or more often in cases of necessity. A third institution nominally owned by the Abbey was St Mary Magdalene's Hospital on the road between the walled part of Colchester and its port. This had also been founded by Eudo as a leper hospital at the behest of Henry I, to be maintained by a ¬£6 grant from the Abbey's manor at Brightlingsea. However, the rector of the Hospital had to resort to petitioning Parliament in the early Fourteenth Century because of the Abbot's heavy-handed attempts to control the Hospital. At one point the Abbot of St John's arrived to demand the charters and common seal of St Mary Magdalene's, and when he was refused these he threw the master, Simon de la Naylonde, and one William de Langham out of the building. In a later inquest into this and other abuses the Abbot was found innocent. At the time of the dissolution the plate of the Abbey amounted to 2,244¬º ounces besides two mytors garnished with silver and gilte, small seade perles and counterfeete stones or glasses, lackinge parte of the garnisshinge. ===List of Abbots=== A list of the Abbots of St John's Abbey has survived: *Hugh of York, the first abbot, 1104. *Gilbert de Lungrill, c. 1104-1129. *William de Scuri, c. 1129-1132. *Hugh de Haya, c. 1132-1148. *Gilbert de Wicham, c. 1148-1164. *Walter Walensis, c. 1164-1179. *Osbert, c. 1179-1195. *Adam de Campes, c. 1195-1238. *William de Wande, 1238-1245. *William de Spaldwic, 1245-1272. *Robert de Grenstede, elected 1272, died 1306. *John de Bruges, elected 1306, died 1311. *Walter de Huntingfeld, elected 1311. *William de Glemham, elected 1326, died 1327. *John de Wymondham, elected 1327, died 1349. *Simon de Blyton, elected 1349, resigned 1353. *Thomas Moveron, elected 1353. *Simon, occurs 1358, died 1368. *Thomas Stukelee, elected 1368, died 1369. *Richard de Colne, elected 1369, died 1375. *John Dedham, elected 1375, died 1377. *William de Gritton, elected 1377, died 1380. *Geoffrey Story or de Sancta Ositha, elected 1380, died 1405. *Roger Best, elected 1405, died 1418. *Robert Gryttone, elected 1418, died 1432. *William Ardeley, elected 1432, died 1464. *John Canon, elected 1464, died 1468. *Walter Stansted, elected 1468, died 1497. *William Lyndesey or Sprowton, elected 1498, died 1517. *John Stoke, elected 1517, resigned 1523. *Thomas Barton, elected 1523, died 1533. *Thomas Marshall (alias John Beche), elected 1533, executed 1539.

Speculation remains that the line could one day re-open under plans to operate a Belfast -- Lisburn -- Antrim -- Belfast circular route, with the possibility of a station for Belfast International Airport which is close to the line at Aldergrove.

He studied music at the University of the Witwatersrand, and worked as a jazz pianist at a number of clubs in Johannesburg. Between 1959 and 1961 he and his childhood friend Saul Ozynski recorded two albums as the Vikings, South Africa's first rock and roll band. Strongly opposed to the apartheid system in his native South Africa, Lubowitz moved to the United Kingdom in 1961 and began to write for \\"Jazz News\\" under the pseudonym Manfred Manne (after jazz drummer Shelly Manne), which was soon shortened to Manfred Mann.Roger Dopson, sleeve notes, Manfred Mann: The E.P. Collection, 1989 The next year he met drummer and keyboard player Mike Hugg at Clacton Butlins Holiday Camp; together they formed a large blues-jazz band called the Mann-Hugg Blues Brothers. This eventually evolved into a five-piece group, and they signed a record deal with EMI in 1963, under the HMV label. They changed their name to Manfred Mann at the suggestion of the label's record producer, and from 1964 to 1969 they had a succession of hit records, including \\"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\\" (originally by The Exciters), \\"Sha La La\\" (originally by The Shirelles), \\"Pretty Flamingo\\", and \\"Mighty Quinn\\" (written by Bob Dylan). The group split up in 1969, and Mann immediately formed another outfit with Mike Hugg, Manfred Mann Chapter Three, an experimental jazz rock band. They disbanded after two albums, but Mann formed a new outfit in 1971, Manfred Mann's Earth Band, which still records and performs to this day.

At the time Jessor was an architect, air-conditioning was especially expensive. He eschewed the typical railroad flat design, which required walking through one room to get to the next, favoring a design where rooms were accessed from a common hallway, providing more privacy to the residents. Jessor was a close ally of such labor unions as the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union, the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Many of the buildings he worked on were funded with the help of these unions. In January 1999, in the wake of a collapse in the Seward Park Housing parking garage,Herszenhorn, David M. \\"Flooded Plaza Collapses Into Garage on the Lower East Side\\", The New York Times, January 17, 1999 New York City building inspectors suspected there could be a potential flaw in Jessor's \\"honeycomb\\" design of the massive garage roof. The roof had been built to support a vast playground/park above, with trees and grass upon hundreds of thousands of pounds of soil. After the collapse on Friday night, January 15, 1999, the New York City Department of Buildings opened an investigation into other Jessor projects to test for durability.Bagli, Charles, V. \\"Spotlight on Architect's Work In Wake of a Garage Collapse\\" The New York Times, January 19, 1999 The investigation did not turn up any major design flaws, and cited convergence of many elements including several days of warm rain, followed by quick freezing, thawing, and refreezing, along with a stoppage in the drainage system combined with minor cracking of the concrete in the roof and the immense weight above. After a four-year lawsuit, the Greater New York Insurance Company, insurer for Seward Park Housing, lost their nonpayment case to the cooperative, and $18 million for the damages. After the insurer won a subsequent appeal, the insurer and coop settled in 2010 with the coop returning $3.25 million to the insurer.http://www.thelodownny.com/leslog/2010/05/seward-park-co-op-and- insurance-company-settle-garage-collapse-lawsuit.html#more-10601 ==See also== * List of New York City housing cooperatives ==References== Category:1895 births Category:1990 deaths Category:20th-century American architects Category:Cooperative organizers Category:Russian Jews Category:Stuyvesant High School alumni ","title":"Herman Jessor"},{"id":"9129259","text":"Canton of Marseille-Le Camas is a former canton located within the commune of Marseille in the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne department of France.

During martial law, when he was on the staff of the Evening News, he was one of the many journalists arrested and detained at Camp Crame. After three months of imprisonment, being bankrupt, he bred fighting cocks, calling the champion breed he developed Newshawk. He commented on current issues on radio and hosted Straight from the Shoulder, a television show which analyzed current events. He was the original host of the television show Brigada Siete. He was the first editor-in-chief of the Philippine Daily Inquirer. He also worked on other newspapers, including the Philippine Star. After President Ferdinand Marcos was overthrown by the EDSA Revolution, Beltran became the editor-in-chief of a new newspaper, the Philippine Daily Inquirer. The pre-martial law show he hosted, Straight from the Shoulder, was revived on GMA Network. He moved from newspaper to newspaper, ending up as a columnist for the STAR. It was then that he became notorious for mentioning in a column about the 1987 coup attempt that then President Corazon Aquino had been hiding under the bed during the coup. For this statement he was sued by the President for libel. Aquino went so far as to show journalists that she could not fit under her bed. Beltran, who openly expressed his belief that the President was lacking in competence, countered that his words were not meant to be taken literally, but Aquino still pursued the case against him and the STAR‚Äôs editor-in-chief Max Soliven. On 22 October 1992, the trial court ruled in Aquino‚Äôs favor, sentencing the columnist and his editor to 2 years of imprisonment and ordering them to pay 2 million pesos in moral damages. But the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court and acquitted Beltran. ==Personal life== His son, Cito Beltran, is also a TV personality, also a columnist and the host of Agenda with Cito Beltran. He has 4 other children, Michael Beltran, Enrique Beltran, Maria Rosario Beltran Altamirano (Marissa) and Ma. Iluminada Beltran (Malu). ==Death== The case was thrown out of court by the Court of Appeals nearly 3 years after Beltran died of a heart attack on September 6, 1994.

Inhabiting the fictional planet of Kulthea, they include types resembling humans (\\"mortals\\"); the immortal \\"elven\\"; hybrid types; and monsters. ==MortalsHigh Men=== *Laan (known as Zor in Jaiman) have average lifespan of approximately 150 years, but are taller and more heavily boned than Elves. *D√∫ranaki (Eastern Lords) are an offshoot of the Zor. Driven underground to hide from fierce enemies, they have grown into a nocturnal and distinctive culture. *Kinsai *Aldari ===Common Men=== Common men on Kulthea tend to be smaller and shorter-lived than their High Men brethren. They are composed of myriad of different racial and cultural groups. The following list addresses some of the primary groups found on Emer and Jaiman. *Anzeti reside in the mountainous regions of central Emer. Hardened by their climate, they are shy and reclusive, isolated, and seldom encountered by other races *Jaaderi make their homes on the plains of Tai- emer. *Rhiani are nomadic residents of the desert plains of Uj in southern Emer famous for their horses. A nictitating membrane shows they are either heavily genetically modified or of an entirely different species from other common men. *Shay are the most numerous human stock, the result of the mixture of many racial sub-groups, that reside in Tai-emer and southern and central H√¶stra. As such, their physical characteristics can be quite varied. Groups of Shay who migrated to Jaiman are called Jameri, though they are effectively identical. *Talath (called Myri in Jaiman) are more powerfully built and taller than most common men, tending to live in agrarian cultures. *Y‚Äônari have a distinctive appearance in Jaiman and Emer because of their almond- shaped eyes that slant slightly up on the outside, and eyelids with epicanthic folds. While they live in relatively isolated cultures in Emer, they form the majority populations of several other continents. ===Other=== *Dwarves (Nomari) ==ImmortalsElves=== Shadow World Elves are taller and stronger than those found in the various Dungeons and Dragons settings, and are immortal. Within Shadow World, elves are divided into a number of sub-types, including Lin√¶ri, Loari, Dyari and Erlini. The first three types are considered the ‚ÄúHigh Born,‚Äù referred to as the Iylari. As a whole, they are generally taller than humans, have elongated ears, larger eyes, and slightly delicate features. To mortals, they can be quite beautiful. Common to all of the elves, however, are their egos, as they view themselves superior to all other races. This self-aggrandizement is demonstrated differently by each particular elven sub-group (i.e., the Erlini are somewhat self-effacing while the Lin√¶ri maintain a certain degree of charm about it), but it is most prominent among the Loari elves, who make no attempt at hiding their contempt for mortals. *Lin√¶ri (\\"Singers\\")are more philosophical and musical of the two groups of Iylari, preferring open spaces to structures and airy homes. They typically have golden blond hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. *Loari (\\"Builders\\") seek power and the ability to craft; they are the forgers of great kingdoms and items of power. They are technologically advanced in the context of Shadow World. *Dyari (\\"Delvers\\") are called \\"Dark Elves\\", but are not dark skinned. They are typically fair skinned with pale or white hair, dark eyes, and can be physically intimidating like the Loari. *Erlini (\\"Growers\\") are commonly called Wood Elves. They tend to be shorter than their high-born brethren and less muscular, but are among the most agile. Like the Lin√¶ri, the Erlini tend to live close to nature and prefer her in her unaltered state. Their architecture is never intrusive on nature, but seeks to work with it and around it. The Erlini are the most likely of the elven groups to intermingle with humans. ==\\"Monsters\\"== *Garks are carnivorous ape-like creatures that inhabit the dense jungles and temperate forests of Emer and Jaiman. They are short, muscular, covered in a mottled gray fur, and only semi-intelligent. They employ crude weapons of stone, bone, or wood when aggressively defending their territory or raiding caravans, travelers, or homesteads. *Murlogi are small and vicious humanoids that carve cavernous homes out of the various mountain chains throughout Kulthea. They are fast- breeding, and their population numbers are uncountable. They are typically 3 ‚Äì 4 ¬Ω feet tall with large distorted faces, long ears, sharp teeth, and long arms. They are mistaken for stupid by surface dwellers, but they are actually skilled tacticians and crafters. *Lugr√¥ki are strong and fierce warriors. Their skin is almost black, and large fangs emerge from their snout-like mouth. They are talented craftsman, but their technology is focused entirely on military applications. Lesser Lugr√¥ki aer somewhat analogous to Orcs in Tolkien's legendarium, while greater Lugr√¥ki resemble the Uruk-hai. *Trolls are big, stupid, and extremely aggressive. Comprising many different kinds, trolls are found in nearly any kind of ecological context. Almost all trolls are sensitive to sunlight, and many local legends hold that they turn to stone or wood if exposed to direct sunlight.

It was originally produced by Edward Padula. ==Background and productions== The all-singing, all-dancing show focuses on the African-American experience with songs on such topics as tenements, slumlords, ghetto life, student protests, black power, and feminism. The music is a mixture of gospel, jazz, funk, soul, calypso, and soft rock.

It had a total run of 1065 performances. In his The New York Times review of the opening night, Clive Barnes described it as \\"a mixture of a block party and a revival meeting\\" and wrote: \\"It is the unexpected that is the most delightful. Last night at the Playhouse Theater a new musical came clapping, stomping and stamping in. It is fresh, fun and black. ...Black heroes such as Flip Wilson and Godfrey Cambridge, and even Bella Abzug and Ralph Nader are mentioned and the show makes wry mockery of the changing times and celebrates the rise of black aspiration and achievements. ...the show is full of talent working together with a cohesian rarely encountered outside the dance world.\\"Barnes, Clive (April 20, 1972), \\"Stage: ‚ÄòDon't Bother Me, I Can't Cope‚Äô\\", The New York Times.

The film presents three separate storylines, told in succession, about a man running after a train and how such an ordinary incident could influence the rest of the man's life. Originally completed in 1981, Blind Chance was suppressed by the Polish authorities for several years until its delayed release in Poland on 10 January 1987 in a censored form. The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival. The film is among 21 digitally restored classic Polish films chosen for Martin Scorsese Presents: Masterpieces of Polish Cinema.Martin Scorsese Presents: Masterpieces of Polish Cinema ==Plot== Witek (Bogus≈Çaw Linda), sitting on an airplane, for some reason screams \\"No!\\" A bleeding person is dragged across a hospital floor. As a child, Witek learns how to write. As an adolescent, Witek dates Czuszka. As an adult, Witek goes to medical school and dates Olga (Monika Gozdzik). Witek 'loses' his calling after the death of his father. Witek decides to catch a train to Warsaw. There he crashes into a fellow drinking beer. Three different outcomes are shown, each depending on how Witek deals with the obstacles on his way to catching the train and whether or not he catches the train. In the first scenario, Witek almost crashes into the fellow drinking the beer. He runs after the train at the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Fabryczna railway station and is able to grab onto the last car's handlebar just in time to pull himself aboard. On the train he meets Werner (Tadeusz ≈Åomnicki), an old Communist. Witek decides to join the Communist Party. On a walk with Werner, Witek meets up with Czuszka (Bogus≈Çawa Pawelec), his first love. The two meet up and have sex, after which a disappointed Czuszka discovers that Witek is applying to join the party. Witek unsuccessfully tries to solve a problem with an airline mechanic. Witek breaks up a sit-in at a hospital. As a reward, a party leader plans to send Witek on a special mission to France. On a walk with Czuszka, a policeman asks them for their papers. Since Witek is a Communist, he is allowed to go on his way, while Czuszka is detained. He attempts to make up with Czuszka, who is speaking at an opposition meeting, but she rejects him. At the airport, Witek is informed that his mission to France has been cancelled. In the second scenario, Witek slams into the fellow drinking the beer with such force that the mug slips from the drinker's hand and falls to the floor, breaking and spilling. Witek doesn't stop to apologize but still fails to catch the train. Instead he runs headlong into a railway guard on the platform, knocks him to the ground, and runs off. The guard calls for backup and Witek is arrested. A judge sentences Witek to thirty days and unpaid community service. Witek joins the anti- Communist resistance and meets up with Daniel, a friend from his childhood, and his sister Wera. He is baptised and the figure of Christ on the cross becomes a significant emblem for him. Witek applies for a passport to go to France, but his request is denied because he is known to be an anti-Communist. The authorities offer him a passport on the condition that he discloses the underground's contacts in France. Witek goes home and begins foreplay with Wera, but is called away to the resistance's lair. The place has been ransacked and the one person left there doubts Witek's loyalty. ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Fabryczna railway station, the turning point in the main character's life In the third scenario, Witek almost crashes into the fellow drinking the beer but stops in time and goes around him, apologizing. He still tries to catch the train but fails. The railway guard shows up a few seconds later but now Witek has stopped to catch his breath. He notices Olga on the platform (it's not clear if she was there in the previous two scenarios). Witek and Olga go back to his apartment where they make love on the floor. Witek decides to resume his medical studies and soon he graduates and starts practicing at the hospital as well as teaching at the medical school. Olga tells him she is three months pregnant, the two get married. Witek refuses to join the Communist Party. At the medical school, some students pass around a petition on behalf of the dean's son, who is accused of hawking illegal literature. Witek refuses to sign the petition, noting that the dean himself hasn't signed either. Witek doesn't want to get involved in politics at all. The dean offers him a trip to Libya to give some lectures on medical topics he has prepared. Witek accepts. On the train to catch the plane, Olga tells Witek she's pregnant with their second child, hoping it is a girl. At the airport, Witek sees some of the people who were more important in the previous two scenarios. The plane taxis on the runway, Witek is comfortable in his seat. The plane takes off, but a few seconds later explodes. ==Cast== * Bogus≈Çaw Linda as Witek * Tadeusz ≈Åomnicki as 1. Werner * Zbigniew Zapasiewicz as 1. Adam * Boguslawa Pawelec as 1.

Krzysztof Kieslowski's Decalogue Series: The Problems of Protagonists and Their Self-Transcendance. New York: Columbia University Press, p. 5. Paul Coates describes this film \\"as marrying a near-psychoanalytic 'Western' preoccupation with the effects of the death of the father ... to a typically 'East European' reluctance to renounce humanism by invoking such psychoanalytic scenarios as the Oedipal one.\\"Coates, Paul (2005). The Red & The White: The Cinema of People's Poland. London: Wallflower Press, p. 190. The filmmaker Agnieszka Holland highly praised the film in an interview for the Criterion Collection's home video release, said \\"Blind Chance is really one of Krzysztof's best films, perhaps even the best and the most original.\\" == Influences == In their interviews on the DVD (both region 1 and 2), Agnieszka Holland and film scholar Annette Insdorf identify Sliding Doors as a film influenced by Blind Chance. In both films, the outcome hinges on whether or not the protagonist catches a train, but in Sliding Doors, only two scenarios are presented (protagonist catches the train, doesn't catch it). Holland said \\"... a number of films just flat-out stole the concept... a mediocre film ... called Sliding Doors.... They took the concept and distorted it to where all the philosophical depth and stylistic subtlety disappeared.\\" Run Lola Run does not involve trains, but is similar to Blind Chance in that three scenarios are presented hinging on how the protagonist negotiates a mad dash through a crowded space. In Blind Chance the outcome of the life of the protagonist depends on how he handles the situation with the beer drinking fellow. In Run Lola Run, Lola had no choice. Her life depends on external factors. Her life changes because she is at the same place but a few seconds later, and so either runs under a car or can just avoid it. In Blind Chance, circumstances lead Witek to have a different character in each plot, echoed in Run Lola Run by the photographic montages shown of the people Lola passes along the way. First Witek is a communist, then a religious anticommunist, and finally he is apolitical. ==Awards== * 1987 Polish Film Festival Silver Lion Award: Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski * 1987 Polish Film Festival Best Actor Award: Boguslaw Linda ==ReferencesBlind Chance - Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski at Culture.pl *Blind Chance: The Conditional Mood an essay by Dennis Lim at the Criterion Collection Category:1981 films Category:Polish films Category:Polish-language films Category:1981 drama films Category:Films directed by Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski Category:Films scored by Wojciech Kilar Category:Films with screenplays by Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski Category:Alternate timeline films Category:Polish drama films ","title":"Blind Chance"},{"id":"9129313","text":"Einar Bakke H√•ndlykken (born 9 August 1976 in Trondheim, Norway) is a Norwegian environmentalist and director of Zero Emission Resource Organisation (ZERO).

Their lyrics are heavily influenced by Russian folklore and Slavic mythology, and their music incorporates several traditional Russian musical instruments. The name of the band \\"Arkona\\" refers to the last Pre-Christianized Slavic city-castle. Their singer and songwriter, Maria \\"Masha Scream\\" Arkhipova, is one of relatively few successful female vocalists to sing in a death growl style. She is married to fellow band member Sergei \\"Lazar\\" Atrashkevich, with whom she has two children. ==History== Arkona in Budapest, 2014 The band was founded in February 2002 by two members of Dolgoprudny Slavic Neopaganism Society: Masha \\"Scream\\" Arkhipova and Alexander \\"Warlock\\" Korolyov, originally as Giperboreya (–ì–∏–ø–µ—Ä–±–æ—Ä–µ—è ‚Äì Hyperborea). At the end of 2002 the group (featuring also Evgeny Knyazev on guitar, Evgeny Borzov on bass and Olga Loginova on keyboards, and now as Arkona) entered the Moscow CDM Studios. Having recorded the Rus' demo (its three tracks re-surfaced in 2006 as bonuses for the live set Zhizn vo Slavu), the band started playing live, performing with fellow Russian folk metal bands, like Butterfly Temple, Pagan Reign, Svarga, and Rossomahaar. In September 2003 Arkona disbanded, due to the general lack of enthusiasm on the part of some of Maria's colleagues. Arkhipova opted to continue and wrote the material for a solo album, which she presented to the members of Nargathrond, another project she was singing for at the time. The resulting debut album Vozrozhdeniye came out in March 2004 on Soundage Production. By this time the band featured three new members: guitarist Sergey \\"Lazar\\", bassist Ruslan \\"Knyaz\\" and drummer Vlad \\"Artist\\". Recorded in the autumn, their second album, Lepta, was released in December. Maria 'Masha Scream' Arkhipova 2005 saw the release of the band's third and highly diverse album Vo slavu velikim!, featuring an acclaimed Russian folk multi-instrumentalist Vladimir Cherepovsky (Mevent, Voinstvo Sadov, Veter Vody) as well various members of Svarga and Alkonost groups. In September 2005 the album went gold in Russia. The group's October performance at the CD's presentation ceremony was recorded, to be released in March 2006 as live DVD/CD Zhizn Vo Slavu. Arkona's fourth studio album Ot serdtsa k nebu, recorded again with Cherepovsky (various members of the Belorussian folk choir Gostitsa also took part) was released by Soundage Productions in 2007. The artwork for the sleeve was provided by the Belgian artist Kris Verwimp who's continued working for the band ever since. In March 2008 Arkona performed at the Ragnar√∂k Festival and were signed to the Austrian label Napalm Records which re-issued Ot Serdtsa K Nebu, and organized the band's 30-date European tour, which ended with their appearance at the Brutal Assault festival. Arkona's fifth studio album, Goi, Rode, Goi!, released in October 2009, proved to be an ambitious affair: all in all, more than 40 musicians took part, including a choir and a string quintet. All ethnic instruments were played in the studio by Vladimir Cherepovsky and his student Vladimir \\"Volk\\", who subsequently joined the band as a full-time member. Prior to that, the band's second DVD Noch Velesova came out in May. 2010 was a year of intensive touring: the band played more than 150 concerts all over Europe. In August 2011 Arkona's sixth studio album Slovo was released; again a stylistically eclectic mix, it featured the Chamber Orchestra of the Kazan Conservatory and the Moscow Conservatory's student choir. That year saw the band appearing at numerous heavy metal events, including Hellfest, With Full Force and Metalfest. Arkona live at Wacken Open Air 2018 In 2011 the band conducted a 36-date tour over Canada, United States and Mexico. The special 10th Anniversary concert was recorded in Moscow on February 11, 2012 (to be released next year as Decade of Glory), followed by massive Russian and European tours, including concerts with Dalriada and Darkest Era, as well as the appearance at the 70,000 Tons of Metal event. In October 2013 the band interrupted their studio recording for another America tour, now as headliners. In January 2014, Arkona announced on its Facebook page that drummer Vlad \\"Artist\\" Sokolov had left the band, citing personal reasons, marking its first lineup change in 10 years. Andrey Ishchenko joined the band as the new drummer. Yav, the concept album, came out in April 2014. In November 2016, Arkona released a re-recorded version of their debut album Vozrozhdenie. In January 2018 Arkona released the studio album Khram. In May 2020, Arkona announced on Facebook that drummer Andrey Ishchenko had left the band. Arkona's albums have been widely acclaimed and the band has repeatedly been called one of the best pagan metal acts. All the members except Vladimir \\"Volk\\" also play in Nargathrond, a pagan/goth rock band that they have put on hold since the international success of Arkona. ==In popular culture== On March 11, 2010, a clip of the song \\"Yarilo\\" from Goi, Rode, Goi! was featured on the St. Patrick's Day episode of the U.S. version of the television series The Office. Three (apparently Russian) janitors walked in with the song playing while the workers were still in the office, forced to work late. ==Members== Vladimir 'Volk' at the Dark Troll 2018 ;Current members *Maria \\"Masha Scream\\" Arkhipova ‚Äì vocals, keyboards (2002-present) *Sergei \\"Lazar\\" Atrashkevich ‚Äì guitars (2003-present) *Ruslan \\"Kniaz\\" Rosomaherov ‚Äì bass (2003-present) *Vladimir \\"Volk\\" Reshetnikov ‚Äì wind ethnic instruments (2011-present) ;Past members *Andrey Ishchenko ‚Äì drums (2014-2020) *Vlad \\"Artist\\" Lyovushkin Sokolov ‚Äì drums, keyboards (2003-2014) *Ilja Bogatyrev ‚Äì guitar (2002-2003) *Evgenij Knjazev ‚Äì guitar (2002-2003) *Evgenij Borzov ‚Äì bass (2002-2003) *Alexandr Warlock ‚Äì drums (2002-2003) *Olga Loginova ‚Äì keyboards (2002-2003) ===Timeline=== ==Discography== ;Studio albums * Vozrozhdeniye (2004) * Lepta (2004) * Vo slavu velikim!

He volunteered for the Canadian army at the age of 17. From here he would attend jump school in Manitoba but did not finish due to an injury. From here he moved onto tanker school in Borden, Ontario. Once he had completed this portion of his training he was assigned to 14th Canadian Hussars. Once in England a number of the armored units were asked to assign a number of its members to a new unit known as the 8th Reconnaissance Squadron, better known as the Canadian 8th Recce. Jiggs' role within the unit was to be a main gunner, radio operator and secondary driver. ==Heroism== In a letter from French President, Jacques Chirac in 2005, it was stated that he has been chosen to receive the \\"Legion of Honor\\". The honor has been bestowed upon Mr. Borland for his saving of the French town of Dieppe, Seine-Maritime from a planned Allied Command air raid. The 8th Recce was made aware, by the French resistance, that the German army had left the town overnight. The Germans had fought with the 2nd Canadian Division earlier in the war and didn't fare well and had no interest in doing it again. Upon learning that there were no Germans in the town Jiggs radioed to headquarters with the news. The response was to go and verify this because the bombing mission had been planned for a long time and wasn't about to be called off without concrete evidence. The 8th Recce set out to verify the claim. Only six vehicles in the unit had radios. Due to the terrain and limitations of the radios the communication link with headquarters was lost every 8 to 10 miles (13 to 16 km). At this point they would leave a vehicle and a few men to re-establish the link. This tactic is never done as there is always the possibility of attack from an enemy force. The 8th Recce didn't have a smooth trip as they encountered small enemy ambushes and a retreating anti-aircraft unit. All of which put up a limited fight. Upon reaching a hill overlooking the town of Dieppe, with only 1 armored car and a bren-gun carrier, Jiggs and his crew of eight others were approached by the Mayor and members of the French Resistance. They told them that there was only one German machine gun nest left in the town and pointed it out. As Jiggs lined up on the window with his main gun, a white flag emerged indicating surrender. The French police then arrested the Germans. Jiggs radioed back to headquarters the following message; \\"Francis is alive and well and will be expecting his friends for dinner\\". This meant that the town was indeed free of the enemy and that the rest of the 2nd Canadian Division could move up to this point. At this point the allied bombers were already in the air and less than 30 minutes from the target. The bombers were then re-routed to another target. When interviewed by local and national news media, he had commented that he does not consider himself a hero. Borland was quoted as saying \\"There was no heroism in it, we were doing our job\\". ==Post war== After the war, Jiggs started homesteading in Oakville, Ontario where he met his wife Alma Giles. Alma was from Newfoundland and convinced Jiggs to move there. In 1953, the family and all their belongings were moved. They settled on a small plot of land between Bishop's Falls and Botwood. The farm was developed and went through many changes over the years, from vegetable to hog to poultry and egg farming. Jiggs has now turned the farm into a popular tourist attraction with a petting zoo, horse back riding, and a bed and breakfast among other things. On the day Jiggs died he was surrounded by family and friends. Just hours before his death he was awarded the \\"Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal\\" by Liberal MP Scott Simms on the Queens behalf. This commemorative medal served to honour significant contributions and achievements by Canadians. ==See also== * List of people of Newfoundland and Labrador ==References== ==External links== *http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=14019&lan;=eng *http://www.thememoryproject.com/stories/13:edward-franklin-grant-jiggs- borland/ Category:1925 births Category:2013 deaths Category:People from Newfoundland (island) Category:Recipients of the Legion of Honour Category:American emigrants to Canada Category:Canadian military personnel of World War II ","title":"Frank Borland"},{"id":"9129431","text":"{ class=\\"infobox\\" width=300 -  - f3f3f3\\"  -  - - f3f3f3\\"  -  } Events from the year 1859 in the United Kingdom. ==Incumbents== * Monarch ‚Äì Victoria * Prime Minister ‚Äì Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby (Conservative) (until 11 June); Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston (Liberal) (starting 12 June) * Parliament ‚Äì 17th (until 23 April), 18th (starting 31 May) ==Events== * 1 January ‚Äì Elizabeth Blackwell becomes the first woman to have her name entered on the General Medical Council's Medical Register, under a clause in the Medical Act 1858 that recognizes doctors with foreign degrees. * 15 January ‚Äì National Portrait Gallery opens in London. * March ‚Äì General Post Office begins erection of First National Standard pillar box design. * 25 March ‚Äì Anniversary Days Observance Act 1859 abolishes observance by the established church of anniversaries of certain 17th-century political events. * 28 April ‚Äì 18 May ‚Äì 1859 United Kingdom general election: Palmerston (Liberal) defeats Derby (Conservative) following a defeat for the latter in the House of Commons. * 30 April ‚Äì Charles Dickens publishes the first issue of his new magazine, All the Year Round, beginning serialisation of A Tale of Two Cities.

It was released on 19 October 2007. The storyline is a remake of the 2004 American film Cellular. ==Plot== In Kuala Lumpur, an Mi6 Agent is on a pursuit who is being chased by some gangsters, rushes to his apartment room and try to send a message to Mi5 with a code \\"EQUINOXA 666007\\" just before being shot-dead by those gangsters. The gangsters then call a man on the phone to inform that the job is done and the secret is saved. The dead agent's finger luckily falls on the keyboard and the message is sent to Mi5. On 22 September, in London, Sandeep Arora (Sandy) (Zayed Khan) arrives from India to convince his girlfriend, who is angry, to return with him to India so that they can get married. From the airport, he boards a taxi and starts interacting with the driver who is a Pakistani, named Iqbal Qureshi (Rajesh Khera) and tells the latter, his reason to come to London. In the same city, Siddharth Verma \\"Sid\\" (Sanjay Suri) who is a chef in a restaurant lives with his wife Richa Verma (Urmila Matondkar), who is a Science teacher and their son Bobby Verma (Taseen Chowdhary). Sandy then arrives at the hotel where his girlfriend, Sanjana (Tanushree Dutta) is staying and finds her in order to convince her to forget the past and marry him but Sanjana is very angry about Sandy's childishness and says that marriage is not a child's play but Sandy keeps on trying so that she forgives him. Sid then reaches the restaurant he works in but enters a secret office with a hidden back door inside the restaurant and it is then revealed that he is actually a secret agent of MI5. Afterwards, his junior co-agent Pam (Ashwini Kalsekar) informs him that their boss James, the head of Mi-5 has asked for him and also states that, James has something big for him and can send him to a big mission. Sid soon meet James, who briefs him about the email that contains the code which was sent by the agent from Kuala Lumpur and also informs him that the email came with a red signal alert, an S.O.S. channel which means an eminent danger to them and can lead to a terrorist attack and orders Sid to crack the code immediately. On the other hand, at Sid's house, Richa returns from her work while talking on the phone and soon finds out that her telephone connection and outside camera connections are disabled and also finds a man standing near her window. It is the same man who the gangsters called in Kuala Lumpur whose name is Kabir Khan (Aftab Shivdasani) who is there to kidnap Richa and eventually succeed and takes her to an unknown location and holds her captive along with aid of his partner Monica Monteiro (Sophie Choudry). At Mi-5's office, Sid and Pam tries to crack the code and Sid finally understands that the code EQUINOXA, where 'EQUINOX' means when day and night are equal, which happens twice in a year, only on 23 March and 22 September and 'A' stands for Autumn. Right after that, Pam freaks out telling Sid that today is in fact '22 September'. Afterwards, Sid finds that his car's alarm has gone off and he goes to check it and gets a call from Kabir, who knows everything about him and tells him to open his car's trunk only to find a video-CD of his wife's captivity. Sid get furious towards Kabir, threatening him that he doesn't have any idea what Sid can do and Kabir replies that he knows what Sid is capable of and that's why they have chosen him for their desired work. Sid then asks about the work but Kabir first orders him to break the CD and throw it in the dustbin but Sid throws it without breaking and Kabir says he told him to break it and then fell it so he asks him to do it again and thus, Sid finds out that they are keeping an eye on him through various CC-TV Cameras and gets ordered to reach Kensington Road. In the meantime, Richa gets restless and cries for help as she knows nothing about what is going on and why she is kidnapped. Suddenly her eyes catch the sight of the broken telephone lying on the ground which Kabir had smashed accidentally while trying to scare her with an axe and Richa thought of calling at Sid's restaurant. On the other hand, Sandy is still trying to convince Sanjana and tells her that she has brought a surprise gift for her and runs down to the lobby to get it from his bag. Richa hardly dials a number to connect to a call and accidentally rings Sandy and asking to be reached out to Siddharth Verma but Sandy thinks someone messing around with him when suddenly Kabir enters the room where Richa is and gives her to talk to Sid and Richa explains everything to Sid and the latter says to describe the place to him and Kabir slaps Richa for showing smartness and tells Sid to go to Barclays Bank where he will get further instructions, while Sandy hears everything over the broken telephone and agrees to help Richa and the latter tells him to go to a police station and make her speak with an officer. Therefore, Sandy rushes to a police station with Iqbal and tells the officer in charge there everything but while the officer was on the phone Richa could not speak as Kabir and Sophie were in front of her and the officer gets angry thinking Sandy is joking and throws him out and then Richa tells him the reason why she could not talk. In Barclays' Sid figures out a way to make someone else get disguised as him while he can search for Richa. Kabir plans to bring in Richa's son Bobby too and Richa gets even more scared and requests Sandy to reach Bobby's school before Kabir does and save him and also describes how Sandy can recognize Bobby and which class he is in. As Sandy finds out he needs a backup, he rings Sanjana and both reach there on time but while they were busy talking with each other Bobby was already taken away by Kabir and Sandy rushes to follow them but eventually loses them. Monica finds that Sid is roaming outside thus fooling them. She calls him and threatens to kill RIcha and tells him to return to the bank and withdraw the money they have transferred to his account and take the money to the location they said. At a National Security office, Rohan Nath (Aashish Chaudhary) asks for a leave from his superior but is turned down as the Indian Prime Minister, Gayatri Devi (Suhasini Mulay) is arriving and Rohan's name has been highly recommended. Rohan soon makes a good impression in front of the PM and her son Raaj (Rajendranath Zutshi) who is the Deputy Chief of her party. Being pleased with Rohan's duty, the PM allows Rohan to spend some quality time with his girlfriend, Sameera (Amrita Arora), whose birthday is on the following day. While leaving the hotel, Sameera forgets her car keys and returns back to the room and finds that Rohan is actually a rogue officer, aiding Kabir to kill the PM and tries to stop him but gets killed at the hands of Rohan. The hotel manager finds the dead body and informs it to Rohan, the PM and Raaj but Rohan covers it up and says he'll take care of everything and the conference will surely take place if this is what the PM wants. On the road, Sanjana catches up with the car in which Kabir is taking Bobby to his den and follows it. While Richa is talking to Sandy she founds a bracelet type-thing over which is written 'Princess Daisy' and Sandy rushes to a bookshop in hope of finding any clue about it and the bookshop owner tells him that Princess Daisy was a horse that died in a stable fire and Sandy immediately catches the point and gets the address of the burned stable from the owner and understands that Richa is there, on the other hand, Richa sees Bobby is also been kidnapped and loses all hope and thanks Sandy for all the help and disconnects the line saying that no can help her now on what she is up to but Sandy says he will save her at any cost and heads to the location. In the nick of time, Sanjana reaches there and saves Bobby and Richa also knocks down the guards and gets herself out only to know about Kabir's plans to kill the Indian Prime Minister and using Sid to kill her and frame him. Both Sanjana and Richa unite and try to escape but fail. Finally, Sandy arrives and blasts the car he came in with and kills all the henchmen and eventually gets in a fight with Monica where Monica gets killed accidentally by her own fault. Sandy saves everybody there and comes to know about Kabir's plans. Sid reaches the hotel and gets the idea that, they will use him to kill the PM and frame him. Afterwards he meets Rohan and Kabir who explain him the plan but Sid identifies Kabir as an ex- officer of Indian Intelligence and asks him why he is doing all these and gets replied that Kabir and his brother were kept rotting in Pakistani jail for two years, they continuously wrote letters to the government asking for help but the Indian Government refused to recognize them. More so, his brother died in front of him tolerating the trashing of the Pakistanis for that government, who left his body unclaimed and orders Sid that if he wants to see his wife and child alive, he wants to see the PM dead. Just before everything goes down, Sandy and Richa arrive at the hotel and start talking with Rohan and tell him about everything and he acts as if he is helping and takes Richa towards room 1426 where Sid is and makes Sandy wait in the lobby and eventually shows his true colors. He then points the gun towards Richa and warns Sid to do as per he says and orders his man in the lobby to kill Sandy. Right then Kabir passes in the lobby and Sandy recognizes him from the voiceover on phone with the line that Kabir continuously says 'Relax Captain, Relax!' and follows him to the washroom and hides behind a toilet door and overhears that this plot is the brainchild of Raaj. He is doing this to become the PM while also using the potential sympathy votes of her murder to win the next elections. But Kabir is informed about Sandy by his men and looks in the bathroom and finds him and Sandy get captured by Kabir's men and after a big brawl Sandy bashes all the thugs and fights his way out and run towards the room 1426 to stop the incident.

From 26 November 1940 to 19 May 1941 Heyda commanded , part of the 21st U-boat Flotilla, for his U-boat commander training, then took command of on 21 June 1941, beginning his first war patrol on 11 November. Near Gibraltar Heyda's U-boat was involved in attacking convoy HG 76 which was heading to Liverpool. At dawn on 18 December U-434 was sighted by the convoy's destroyers north of Madeira, in position and attacked with depth charges. U-434 was forced to the surface and then rammed by the destroyer and sunk. Two members of U-434s crew were killed and 42 were taken prisoner. Commander Frederic John Walker, , commander of the 36th Escort Group sank four U-boats on his first war patrol, including U-434. Heyda was eventually sent to the Bowmanville POW camp in Ontario, near Toronto, Canada. ===Prisoner of war=== At Bowmanville in October 1942 an insurrection of the prisoners protesting their being shackled took place for three days. The insurrection became known as the Battle of Bowmanville. Commander Otto Kretschmer was instrumental in the rebellion, having assaulted a Canadian guard and taken him prisoner. ===Escape attempt === Operation Kiebitz, a plan to have Otto Kretschmer, Horst Elfe, Hans Ey and Hans Joachim Knebel-D√∂beritz escape and be picked up by a U-boat, was developed in 1942 and was to be executed in September 1943. Knebel-D√∂beritz was the former adjutant of Admiral Karl D√∂nitz. The successful escape of Kretschmer, a top U-boat ace, would be a major propaganda coup for the Germans. However, their escape plan was foiled, but Heyda made an escape via electric wires over a barbed wire fence. He then traveled to Pointe de Maisonnette, New Brunswick on Chaleur Bay where he was to be picked up by a U-boat. Police forces in Canada and the United States started a manhunt for the escaped POW. Heyda was captured on the beach at Pointe de Maisonnette where Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) were waiting for the U-boat to surface off-shore (the RCN had a substantial anti- submarine task force led by hidden nearby). Heyda was taken to the Pointe de Maisonnette lighthouse where Lieutenant Commander Desmond Piers of the Royal Canadian Navy commanded the operation. There, Piers confronted Heyda who claimed to be a tourist on vacation. Depth charges were heard in the bay, but the commander of , Kapit√§nleutnant Rolf Schauenburg, evaded the attacking ships and made it safely into the Atlantic, only to be sunk six weeks later by ships of RN and RCN. ==Death== Heyda was returned to Camp 30, and was eventually released from captivity in May 1947. He died of polio in the Kiel University health clinic just three months later on 21 August 1947. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:1913 births Category:1947 deaths Category:People from Orzysz Category:People from East Prussia Category:U-boat commanders (Kriegsmarine) Category:Military history of Canada during World War II Category:Deaths from polio Category:German prisoners of war in World War II held by the United Kingdom ","title":"Wolfgang Heyda"},{"id":"9129568","text":"City is the second studio album by English electronic music group Client, released on 27 September 2004 by Toast Hawaii.

The first care facility for the mentally disabled in the US was the Walter E. Fernald State School, established in 1848. Elwyn is located in Elwyn, Pennsylvania, in Middletown Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. It has had a variety of names over its history, including the \\"Pennsylvania Training School for Feeble-minded Children\\". In 1966, it became the \\"Elwyn Institute\\". Today, it is \\"Elwyn.\\" Elwyn services include education, rehabilitation, and employment options, child welfare services, assisted living, respite care, campus and community therapeutic residential programs, and other supports for daily living. Elwyn has satellite operations in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, as well as programs in California. Elwyn is named for its founder, Dr. Alfred L. Elwyn, a Pennsylvania nonpracticing physician and philanthropist. Elwyn has served as a consultant in the United States and overseas, assisting with the development of similar services. ==History== Dr. Alfred Elwyn traveled to Boston for a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1849. He had promised to take a letter from Rachel Laird, a blind girl living in Philadelphia, to Laura Bridgman (December 21, 1829-May 24, 1889), who was a famous blind deaf mute in Boston. Bridgman was studying at the South Boston Institute for the Blind, and while there Elwyn visited a classroom for mentally deficient children run by teacher Dr. James B. Richards. Elwyn was impressed with Richards' work, and resolved to do something similar in Pennsylvania. In 1852, with Richards, Elwyn established a training school for the mentally retarded in Germantown, Pennsylvania. In 1853, the Pennsylvania State Legislature formally chartered \\"The Pennsylvania Training School for Feeble-Minded Children\\" with Richards as its first superintendent in Germantown. The school soon outgrew its facilities in Germantown, and in 1857 a farm was purchased in Media, Pennsylvania to house a new facility with help from the Pennsylvania legislature. The buildings were completed in 1859 and Elwyn, Richards, and 25 students moved in on September 1, 1859. The school was officially dedicated November 2, 1859. In 1870, Dr. Elwyn became President of the Elwyn School. The West Chester and Philadelphia Railroad had a nearby stop called the \\"Greenwood\\" stop, but local residents called it the \\"Elwyn Station\\". The nearby community also became known as \\"Elwyn\\". ==Locations== *Elwyn, founded 1852. **Media, Pennsylvania, Main facility, established in 1859. **Philadelphia, established in 1982. **Wilmington, Delaware, established in 1974. **Vineland, New Jersey, Vineland Training School, established 1888, merged with Elwyn in 1988. *Elwyn California, independent affiliate, established in 1974. **Fountain Valley, California **Torrance, California *Israel Elwyn, independent, former affiliate, established in 1984. ==References== ==External links== *Elwyn History *Elwyn Historical Archives, The Archives and Library on Disability, University of Colorado Category:Educational institutions established in 1852 Category:Special schools in the United States Category:1852 establishments in Pennsylvania ","title":"Elwyn (company)"},{"id":"9129610","text":"Heartlight may refer to: *Heartlight (album), an album by Neil Diamond **\\"Heartlight\\" (song), the title song *Heartlight (novel), a novel by T.

The Zasavica is a 33.1 km-long right tributary to the Sava river which entirely flows through the region of Maƒçva. It originates from the several streams out of the swamps north of the village of Sala≈° Crnobarski, in the floodplain of the lower course of the Drina river. The river flows in the north-east direction, for 10 km parallel to the flow of the Sava and next to the villages of Glogovac, Sovljak, Crna Bara, Banovo Polje and Radenkoviƒá, where the river crosses the administrative border of Central Serbia and the province of Vojvodina, where it flow near the settlements of Ravnje, Zasavica I, Zasavica II, Noƒáaj, and Maƒçvanska Mitrovica. At village Banovo Polje two major headstreams, Jovaƒça and Prekopac, meet and from that point the river is called Zasavica. Near the village of Zasavica, the river enters the marshy area of the Zasavica bog where the 50‚Äì60 metres wide stream spreads to almost 300 meters and gets 2 metres deep, and meanders through the middle of it until it flows into the Sava at Maƒçvanska Mitrovica, right across the town of Sremska Mitrovica on the Sava. The final section is channeled (Bogaz canal) and the river often floods the surrounding area. The name of the river could be translated as the ‚Äúbehind Sava‚Äù. It actually flows through the typical elongated \\"mrtvaja\\" (oxbow), the old (fossil) bed of both the Sava and later, the Drina rivers. Because of the river‚Äôs meandering course and the low terrain, a bog was created, while the river itself changes the course depending on how much atmospheric waters it gets during the year. ==References== Category:Rivers of Serbia Category:Geography of Vojvodina Category:Maƒçva ","title":"Zasavica (river)"},{"id":"9129657","text":"Glamis is an unincorporated community in Imperial County, California.

The theorem follows from the fact that the spectrum of any element of a complex Banach algebra is nonempty: for every element a of a complex Banach algebra A there is some complex number Œª such that Œª1 ‚àí a is not invertible. This is a consequence of the complex-analyticity of the resolvent function. By assumption, Œª1 ‚àí a = 0. So a = Œª ¬∑ 1\\\\. This gives an isomorphism from A to C. The theorem can be strengthened to the claim that there are (up to isomorphism) exactly three real Banach division algebras: the field of reals R, the field of complex numbers C, and the division algebra of quaternions H. This result was proved first by Stanis≈Çaw Mazur alone, but it was published in France without a proof, when the author refused the editor's request to shorten his proof.

CommunityViz also allows users to export and view their work in ArcGIS Online, Google Earth and other KML/KMZ viewers such as ArcGIS Explorer. The software was originally produced by the Orton Family Foundation and in 2005 was handed off to Placeways LLC. In 2017, the software was purchased by City Explained, Inc. where its development continues. ==History== CommunityViz began as an idea in the late 1990s when Noel Fritzinger and his friend Lyman Orton, proprietor of the Vermont Country Store and long-term member of his town‚Äôs local planning board, first envisioned a software tool that would make the planning process more accessible to ordinary citizens. After forming the Orton Family Foundation, they recruited a consultant team to develop the idea. The initial team included The Environmental Simulation Center, Fore Site Consulting, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Multigen-Paradigm, and Green Mountain GeoGraphics. The first commercial version was released in late 2001 and included three components: Scenario Constructor for interactive analysis, SiteBuilder 3D (OEMed from MultiGen-Paradigm) for 3D visualization, and Policy Simulator for agent-based modeling of future outcomes resulting from present- day policy decisions. By 2003 there was enough experience and research to guide a complete redevelopment that resulted in CommunityViz Version 2. The new version was built for the new architecture of ArcGIS 8.x. It changed Scenario Constructor to Scenario 360 and gave it a new, intuitive interface. SiteBuilder 3D was updated, but Policy Simulator was dropped from the package. The new design quickly gained popularity. In 2005, CommunityViz development and operations were spun off from the Foundation into a new company called Placeways LLC. With continuing guidance and financial support from the Foundation, Placeways continued with new research and development, introducing Version 3 and its ‚Äúdecision tool‚Äù architecture in the fall of 2005, Version 4 with new 3D technology in 2009, and Version 5 with new web publishing technology in 2015, with numerous interim releases and feature upgrades on a continuing basis. In 2017, development of the software was handed off to City Explained, Inc. The current release of CommunityViz is Version 5.1. The software is sold using different price tiers for commercial, government/non- profit and educational users. Version 5.1 is compatible with ArcGIS 10.3, 10.4, 10.5 and 10.6. ==Analysis Capabilities== In CommunityViz Scenario 360, users can create their own analyses across multiple scenarios using custom formulas, indicators, and charts which all update dynamically in real time as the user makes changes on the map or to the calculations. Because CommunityViz is an extension to ArcGIS, users can bring in GIS data and use CommunityViz while maintaining access to extensive ArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Online functionality. Data from other external models can be brought in as well. The CommunityViz dynamic analysis engine provides a versatile modeling framework. It includes over 90 analysis functions ranging from simple arithmetic to complex geospatial calculations, and the functions themselves can be assembled into compound formulas that reference one another to create a complete model. Model calculations typically run in real time, so that as a user experiments with edits to a map, changes to modeling inputs (called assumptions), scenarios, or alternate data inputs, results appear immediately. Modeling results are displayed in a variety of visual forms including color-changing maps, dynamically changing charts, tables and reports, and potentially 3D visualizations. ==Tools== CommunityViz contains additional analysis features including several for creating indicators, such as the 360 Indicators Wizard which can produce up to 101 indicators, the Custom Impacts Wizard to aid in designing your own indicators, and the ability to freely design as many of your own formulas and indicators as you desire. Other tools include the Land Use Designer which allows you to paint desired land uses and analyze the effects, the Build-Out Wizard which calculates the development capacity for your land, a Suitability Wizard, and TimeScope which allows you to visualize change through time. Allocator 5 and Allocator Wizard (Allocator 4) are decision tools that helps you model patterns of future growth. It distributes a user-specified quantity of new buildings across the map according to the capacity and desirability of each land use feature. Allocation, sometimes known by the acronym LUAM (Land Use Allocation Model), is a key tool in many long-range transportation and land use planning processes. Linking the Build- Out, Suitability and Allocator 5 tools creates a powerful and flexible urban growth modeling suite, used by cities, counties and regional governments. ==Users== CommunityViz's Scenario 3D being used to plan a site development. CommunityViz is used primarily for land-use planning and natural resource management, but because it allows its users to create custom analyses, it can be applied to almost any geographic decision-making process. The largest user groups comprise government planners (local, regional, and national), private planning and design firms, and universities. Most users are already somewhat familiar with GIS or have access to a GIS department. CommunityViz has been used extensively by academics and researchers. A selected list of papers and publications can be downloaded from CommunityViz Selected Publications on the City Explained website. ==3D Tools== Current 3D capabilities include: *Automatically export to Google Earth and create scenes using SketchUp models. *Create highly realistic, interactive 3D scenes using Scenario 3D with 3D models in common CAD and SketchUp formats (.KMZ, .3DS, and COLLADA interchange (.DAE)). *Works as an extension to ArcGIS ArcScene. ==Awards== At the 2011 Esri Business Partners Conference, Placeways received the Extension to ArcGIS Desktop award for CommunityViz. ==Book== In 2011, The Planners Guide to CommunityViz: The Essential Tool for a New Generation of Planning, by Doug Walker and Tom Daniels, was published and made available for purchase through the APA Planners Press. The book, through visuals, examples, and case studies, demonstrates CommunityViz applications across many disciplines and the many ways it can be applied including for analysis, visualization, and public participation. == Common misspellings == \\"CommunityVis,\\" \\"Community Viz,\\" \\"communityviz,\\" \\"Communitybiz\\" and \\"Communityviz\\" are some of the most common ways of misspelling the name.

It was refounded at Coverham in about 1212 by her son Ranulf fitzRalph, who had the body of his late mother reinterred in the chapter house at Coverham. There is some evidence that the during the first half of the 14th century the abbey and its holdings were attacked by the Scots, with the abbey itself being virtually destroyed. Later in that century there is a record of there being fifteen canons plus the abbot in residence. The abbey ruins are a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a Grade I listed building. ==Swainby Abbey== Site of the abbey (2007) Swainby Abbey () was a Premonstratensian abbey in North Yorkshire, England. It was founded in 1187 or 1188 by Helewise, the daughter of Ranulph de Glanville, Sheriff of Yorkshire and later Justiciar for King Henry II. She was the wife of Robert, Lord of Middleham. In 1195, Helewise was buried at the abbey. The monastery was moved to Coverham in 1202. == Dissolution and remains == The abbey was closed in 1536. Thomas Wraye, father of Sir Christopher Wray (Chief Justice of the King's Bench, 1574‚Äì1592), was the last seneschal of the abbey. It was sold to Humphrey Orme and quickly became a ruin.

He stated his nurse, regretted he had not been named Kenny, after the patron saint to whom he thus had a double allegiance. He went to Trinity College, Dublin in 1834, from where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1839. Appointed curate to Skeirke in Co. Laois, he rapidly obtained preferment, and as curate of St Patrick's Kilkenny, was attached as Treasurer to St Canice's Cathedral, before gaining a living in the county. Although married, he had no children. His fame rests in his antiquarian and archaeological interests, rather than in his clerical pursuits. A close friend of John O'Donovan, he was also acquainted with George Petrie, and like them devoted his life towards the preservation of the antiquities of his native country. His main point of interest however was the architecture of his own city and county, and his interests therefore were focussed not on the pre-Norman period of Irish history but on the period from circa 1169 onward. In particular, he was responsible for the careful conservation work on St Canice's cathedral in Kilkenny city, while he was treasurer, and in the 1860s and 1870s he worked through the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, of which he was himself a founding member, towards the conservation of several important ruined medieval churches. Although he is never accorded the degree of fame as a founding father of Irish archaeology which is given to Petrie, his effort towards the preservation of medieval Irish buildings was highly significant. In particular, as a respectable Anglican clergyman, he was able to gain the ear of the establishment more easily than some of his Catholic contemporaries. This proved of importance after the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland left many then ruinous church sites in an ambiguous position, which was rectified by their being taken into state care as National Monuments. ==Bibliography== * == Further reading == * * ==Notes and referencesNotes=Citations=Primary sources=== * Category:1815 births Category:1886 deaths Category:Irish archaeologists Category:People from County Kilkenny ","title":"James Graves (antiquarian)"},{"id":"9129744","text":"William Babington may refer to: * William Babington (academic), Vice- Chancellor of Oxford University, 1441‚Äì1443 * William Babington (justice) (c. 1370‚Äì1454), English lawyer and judge * William Babington (physician) (1756‚Äì1833), Anglo-Irish physician and mineralogist ==See also== * W.

The northern portion is laid out grid fashion; avenues run alphabetically north and south, Streets run numerically east and west. After Avenue Y South, the Avenues are named after Canadian cities such as Montreal, Ottawa, Winnipeg and Vancouver. Witney Avenue is the only anomaly to the naming convention, and is named in lieu of having an Avenue Z.An Avenue Z was ultimately constructed in the South West Industrial area, though it was removed in the 1980s. Prior to the construction of the Circle Drive and 22nd Street interchange, motorists were able to access the Fairhaven neighborhood from Meadowgreen via 18th Street through a signalized grade crossing intersection at Clancy Drive and Circle Drive, and also off Circle Drive via 20th Street. Prior to a heated debate, the initial plan called for the intersection of 18th Street/Clancy Drive and Circle Drive to remain as the interchange called for no access to eastbound 22nd Street from southbound Circle Drive as the 20th Street intersection would cease to exist when construction started. Fearing an increased volume in traffic along 18th Street, a re-drawing saw a leg of Camponi Crescent become part of the interchange and access to 18th Street from Circle Drive would cease to exist, leaving access to Circle Drive from either 11th or 22nd Streets. The 18th Street/Circle Drive intersection was closed to traffic in 2001, and all traces of the roadway between Circle and the CN rail line were permanently removed in 2002, however the signalized grade crossing intersection at Circle Drive and Clancy Drive remains as it was reconfigured to a layout similar to that of the intersection of Circle Drive and Laurier Drive following the closure of 18th Street. The net result is there is currently no direct access to Meadowgreen from the west; however 18th Street could possibly be reconnected if an overpass/interchange is ever constructed at Circle and Clancy.Selling an Idea or a Product URL accessed January 27, 2007 ==Life== Meadowgreen Community Association operates out of W.P.

The assault, which left five U.S. soldiers dead and three wounded, has been called the \\"boldest and most sophisticated attack in four years of warfare\\" and is furthermore notable for being one of the few instances when militants have actually managed to capture U.S. soldiers. ==Background== Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Karbala province had not seen the same intensity of violence that had wracked other areas of Iraq such as Baghdad and Al Anbar province. Although Karbala had been the site of many attacks, it had largely been free of the spectacular bombings that regularly took place in Baghdad or the heavy urban warfare seen in Fallujah, Mosul, Najaf, Ramadi, and elsewhere. There were two notable exceptions: the March 2004 Ashura massacre and the uprising of Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army across southern Iraq the following month. Prior to the 20 January raid, only 33 Coalition soldiers had been killed in Karbala province, constituting just over 1% of total coalition fatalities in Iraq. ==The raid== The attack was perpetrated by \\"nine to 12 militants posing as an American security team ... [who] traveled in black GMC Suburban vehicles ‚Äî the type used by U.S. government convoys ‚Äî had American weapons, wore new U.S. military combat fatigues, and spoke English.\\" This was denied by the surviving soldiers. According to one Iraqi official, the militant team was led by a blond-haired man. The attack occurred as the U.S. military continued preparations to leave. About 30 U.S. troops were inside the compound at the time. After being waved through the last of three checkpoints manned by Iraqi security forces at around 17:45, the militants parked their (at least) five SUVs near the city's Provisional Joint Coordination Center (PJCC) main building. The attackers' convoy divided upon arrival, with some vehicles parking at the back of the main building others parking in front. The commandos first used homemade explosive to burn the two Security Vehicles outside. Then they entered the building using fragmentation grenades in an attempt to isolate the two officers. They then stormed into a room the Americans used as a barracks room, attacking with grenades and small arms fire. Once the soldiers in the room were isolated they proceeded to capture two U.S. soldiers, 1LT Jacob Noel Fritz and CPT Brian Scott Freeman. They pulled two more soldiers, PFC Shawn Patrick Falter and SPC Jonathan Bryan Chism out of an armored humvee at the entrance. One soldier, PVT Jonathon Miles Millican, died and three were wounded when a grenade thrown by insurgents exploded in the barracks room on the first floor of the building. Three U.S. humvees were damaged by separate explosions in the raid. No Iraqi policemen or soldiers were injured in the raid, as the insurgents specifically targeted the U.S. soldiers in the compound. At approximately 18:00, the insurgents broke off the attack and left the compound with their prisoners, heading east toward neighbouring Babil province. Shortly after crossing the Euphrates River, the militants, who were then being followed by U.S. attack helicopters, shot their four captives and abandoned five vehicles along with uniforms, equipment, and a rifle. Three soldiers were found later by Iraqi police with gunshot wounds to their chests near Bu-Alwan, a village close to Mahawil. Three were already dead (two handcuffed together in the back of one of the SUVs and the other on the ground) and the fourth showed up at nearby hospital with a gunshot wound to the head. On the day of the attack, the U.S. military reported only that five soldiers were killed while \\"repelling the attack.\\" The full details of the attack, including the militants' penetration of the PJCC compound and the capture of four of the five soldiers, were not released until a week later. ==Aftermath and analysis== Four individuals suspected of participating in the raid were detained on January 22 by U.S. troops and Iraqi security forces. The mastermind behind the attack, Azhar al-Dulaimi, was killed on May 18 by U.S. forces. ===Evidence for Iranian involvement=== According to two unnamed U.S. officials, the Pentagon is examining the possibility that the raid was supported or conducted by Iranians. In a speech on 31 January 2007, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated that Iran was supporting attacks against Coalition forces in Iraq and some Iraqis suspect that the raid may have been perpetrated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps's Qods Force in retaliation for the U.S. raid on the Iranian Liaison Office in Erbil on 11 January. In response to such speculations, Hassan Kazemi Qomi, the Iranian ambassador to Iraq, \\"ridiculed evidence the U.S. military claimed to have proving Iranian involvement in planning attacks on U.S. and Iraqi forces.\\" Journalist Bill Roggio has suggested that the attackers may have intended to transfer the captured Americans over the border to Iran. On July 2, 2007, the U.S. military said that information from captured Hezbollah fighter Ali Moussa Dakdouk established a link between Quds Force and the Karbala raid. Dakdouk worked as a liaison between Quds force and the Shia group that carried out the raid. According to the United States, Dakdouk said that the Shia group \\"could not have conducted this complex operation without the support and direction of the Quds force.\\"\\"[US links Iran to attack in Iraq http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6260690.stm]\\", BBC News, July 2, 2007. Retrieved July 2, 2007. On June 9th, 2007, Bill Roggio of the Long War Journal wrote that U.S. Government had discovered satellite imagery showing an exact mockup of the Karbala Provincial Joint Coordination Center compound inside of Iran. It is believed that the Iranian Qods Force used this mockup to train the perpetrators of the attack and is further evidence of direct Iranian involvement. ===Other incidents=== 20 January 2007 was the third-deadliest day of the Iraq War for U.S. troops, with 20 other U.S. soldiers killed throughout Iraq, including 12 in a helicopter crash caused by hostile ground fire north of Baghdad in Diyala Governorate. ==See also== * Operation Greif * Ahmed Kousay Altaie ‚Äì A U.S. Army soldier who was captured by Iraqi insurgents and executed * Wassef Ali Hassoun ‚Äì A U.S. Marine who claimed to be captured by Iraqi insurgents; later discovered to be a hoax * American POWs in the 2003 invasion of Iraq * 2004 Iraq KBR convoy ambush ‚Äì Capture and execution of Keith Matthew Maupin, a U.S. Army soldier * June 2006 abduction of U.S. soldiers in Iraq ‚Äì Capture and execution of Kristian Menchaca and Thomas L.

Oman has developed its own subsect of Islam, known as Ibadhism, however other strands of Islam such as Sunni and Shi'a are also practiced. With this in mind, the Islamic month of fasting, Ramadan, and other Islamic festivities are very important events in the Omani culture. Oman has the most diverse culture in the Gulf Cooperation Council. ==Dress== Omanis in Nizwa. For men, the national dress is an ankle-length, collarless gown with long sleeves, called a dishdasha. Usually, the clothing is white, although a few other colors such as brown, lilac, and black are sometimes worn. There are many accessories men can wear, for example, the muzzar (a type of turban), the assa (a cane or stick used mainly for formal occasions), and the khanjar. The khanjar is a ceremonial curved dagger worn during formal occasions, often described as \\"an important symbol of male elegance\\". The national dress for Omani women includes a dress worn over trousers (sirwal) and a headdress (lihaf). Usually, the materials used are of very colorful, vibrant colors. Traditionally, Omani women would wear a kind of wooden platform shoe, but nowadays, most prefer to wear sandals. The cut of the clothing differs in various regions, as do color, embroidery, and materials. Women complete their outfit with gold jewelry and cosmetics, opting for either brand-name or traditionally-made items. When in public, most women in cities wear the abaya, a modest black dress or cloak worn over the clothes, and the hijab, the typical Muslim hair covering. ===Dhow=== Being a seafaring nation, an important symbol in Oman is the dhow. These sailing ships have been used for centuries along the Arabian Peninsula, India, and East Africa for the purpose of trade. In fact, the earliest reported use of an Omani dhow was in the 8th century, arriving in China. In modern-day use, the dhows operate for the purpose of trade, tourism, and fishing, and they can be seen all along Oman's coastline. The main ports of a large fleet, while Sur maintains an extensive dhow-building industry. ==Cuisine== The cuisine of Oman is generally very simple, with the aid of many spices and marinades to complete a dish, which usually consists of chicken, fish, and lamb. Unlike that of many other Asian nations, Omani cuisine is not spicy, and varies regionally. Everyday meals generally have components such as rice, a wide variety of soups, salad, curry, and fresh vegetables. For dessert, many Omani people have a kind of sweet, known as Omani halwa. This is usually served before the consumption of kahwa, a preparation of coffee with cardamom, which is very popular and remains a symbol of hospitality. Other popular beverages include tea, laban (a kind of salty buttermilk), yoghurt drinks, and soft drinks like mountain dew. For festive occasions, special dishes are prepared, particularly for Islamic tradition. The range of dishes is very diverse, and there are certain meals only prepared during Ramadan. ==See also== * Islam in Oman * List of traditional games in Oman * List of museums in Oman * Music of Oman * Cinema of Oman * Women in Oman * Culture of Eastern Arabia ==References== Roche, T. & Roche, E.

November 15, 1916 Philippine legislature before 1924 The Philippine Legislature was the legislature of the Philippines from 1907 to 1935, during the American colonial period, and predecessor of the current Congress of the Philippines. It was bicameral and the legislative branch of the Insular Government. From 1907 to 1916, under the Philippine Organic Act of 1902, the legislature's lower house was the elected Philippine Assembly and its upper house was the appointed Philippine Commission, headed by the American Governor General (who also served as the executive of the Insular Government). In 1916, the Jones Law abolished the Philippine Commission and reorganized the Philippine Legislature as a fully elected, bicameral legislature composed of the Senate and House of Representatives, precursors to current Senate of the Philippines and House of Representatives of the Philippines. In 1935, the Commonwealth of the Philippines was established and the National Assembly of the Philippines replaced the Philippine Legislature. == History  Under the Philippine Organic Act (1907‚Äì1916) === The Philippine Organic Act of July 1902 stipulated that a Philippine legislature would be established after several conditions were met, such as the end of the \\"Philippine Insurrection\\". The legislature was to have an upper house consisting of the appointed Philippine Commission and a lower house, the Philippine Assembly, its members chosen by national election. The two houses would share legislative powers, although the upper house alone would pass laws relating to the Moros and other non-Christian peoples. Two Filipino Resident Commissioners were sent to Washington to attend sessions of the United States Congress. The act also extended the United States Bill of Rights to the Philippines. The Philippine Legislature convened its first session on October 16, 1907 at the Manila Grand Opera House. Conflict between the bodies, the American-majority Commission and the all- Filipino, Nacionalista-led Assembly, were not uncommon. Such conflicts came to an end when the Jones Law created a bicameral legislature composed exclusively of Filipinos.  Philippine Commission (1900‚Äì1916)  The Second Philippine Commission, headed by William Howard Taft and known as the Taft Commission, was established by the President of the United States William McKinley in 1900 to exercise legislative and limited executive powers in the Philippines. Its members, both American and Filipino, were appointed by the US President. Beginning in 1907, it acted as the upper house of a bicameral legislature.  Philippine Assembly (1907‚Äì1916)  On July 30, 1907, the first elections for the Philippine Assembly were held. Two political groups dominated the elections‚Äîthe Nacionalista Party and Nationalist Progressive Party. Minority parties and independent candidates also competed. The Nacionalista Party, which espoused \\"immediate and complete independence\\" was headed by future Philippine president Sergio Osme√±a, captured a majority of the 80‚Äìseat Assembly. The Assembly was the first fully elected national legislative body. === Under the Jones Law (1916‚Äì35) === The Jones Law of 1916, also known as the Philippine Autonomy Act, changed the legislative arrangement. The Philippine Commission was abolished and replaced by the elected Senate of the Philippines. The Philippine Assembly was also reorganized and renamed the House of Representatives. The new Philippine Legislature was inaugurated on October 16, 1916. The Philippine Legislature was the country's legislative body until 1935 when it was superseded by the National Assembly of the Philippines upon the establishment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. == See also == * History of the Philippines (1898‚Äì1946) == Sources == * == References == == External links == *Philippine Assembly An article published in an American newspaper examining the membership and accomplishments of the Philippine Assembly during the early years of American rule.

The film stars Rutger Hauer, Matthew Davis, Dagmara Dominczyk, and Susan Misner. ==Plot== Matthew Davis stars as Carter, introduced as a thirtysomething professor at a mediocre college. Through flashbacks, we learn about Carter's time as a promising writer enrolled in an exclusive grad school class taught by Sanford Pollard (Rutger Hauer), a hard- drinking, hard-driving, brilliant but abrasive writer whose career has stalled since winning a Pulitzer Prize decades ago. Julia (Dagmara Dominczyk) is Sanford's graduate assistant as well as his lover. Sanford and Julia \\"adopt\\" the young, eager Carter and expose him to the world of wealth, television, and drugs. Carter travels with them to Sanford's beach house, where he and Julia eventually become lovers. In the present, Carter has become a shadow of his former promise, a lethargic teacher, an alcoholic, excessive smoker, lacking the ability to sustain relationships. Like Sanford, he has worked his way through a series of graduate assistant girlfriends, and we watch as he apparently allows his relationship with Susan (Lynn Chen) to wither away. Carter is on a reckless path until he receives notice that Sanford has died of cancer. The film jumps back and forth from the present to ten years earlier, as Carter wrestles with the unresolved emotions he felt with Sanford and Julia. After attending Sanford's funeral, Carter returns to the beach house, where Sanford's will is being read. There he again meets Julia, older but still appealing, and they discover that Sanford has left the two of them his entire estate. The film ends ambiguously, with Carter and Julia driving off into the night in the Porsche that had been Sanford's, but which is now theirs in \\"joint custody\\". ==Cast== * Rutger Hauer as Sanford Pollard * Matthew Davis as Carter * Dagmara Dominczyk as Julia * Susan Misner as Marilyn Conner * Matt Servitto as Howard * Peter Scolari as Jonathan Parks * Lynn Chen as Terry Valentine * Isabel Glasser as Margaret Burger * Lawrence Pressman as Kendal * Ronald Guttman as Interviewer * Carrie Yaeger as Nurse ==Film notes== Mentor was first presented at the Tribeca Film Festival in the spring of 2006.

This led to A&R; roles at several major record labels, before ultimately becoming manager to the Brand New Heavies. He has played as part of Emmylou Harris's band, Spyboy, Steve Earle and the Dukes, Dave Matthews & Friends,Orshoski, Wes (2003) \\"Dave Matthews Goes Solo\\", Billboard, 11 October 2003, p. 3, 96 and with Buddy & Julie Miller.Grant Alden, Peter Blackstock (2009) No Depression #77: Surveying the Past, Present, and Future of American Music, University of Texas Press, , p. 137 ==Return to drumming== Early 1995 saw Emmylou Harris persuade Brady to return to his kit as part of her touring band Spyboy, along with Daniel Lanois and Darryl Johnson. The following year they were joined by Buddy Miller and toured throughout the mid-nineties, culminating in a live album Spyboy, released in 1998. Touring the world with Emmylou Harris led Brady to encounter and be seen by some of the key figures in the American music scene which resulted in Brady becoming one of the most in-demand session drummers around. Brady took part in extensive tours and sessions with the Steve Earle during his El Coraz√≥n period; Jewel throughout her 1998 Spirit world tour; and the Indigo Girls on their 1999 album Come on Now Social, 2002's Become You, 2004's All That We Let In, and 2011's Beauty Queen Sister. ==Dave Matthews & Friends== A chance meeting with Dave Matthews whilst on tour with Emmylou Harris eventually led to Brady being invited to form the nucleus of Matthew's jam band project Dave Matthews & Friends, bringing bassist Tony Hall into the project. The group went on to record and release the album Some Devil,\\"Star- Studded Event\\", Billboard, 6 December 2003, p. 43 and toured extensively across the USA. The group reformed after a period of hiatus to headline the 2004 Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee and the 2005 Vegoose music festival. ==Current activities== In recent years, Brady has expanded his work to include production and writing. His work has largely been focused on working with new acts, developing their song-writing and ultimately producing and recording with them. He has had a number of major successes, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, where his work has featured prominently in their national music charts, producing the debut records of both Brooke Fraser and Annabel Fay and Annah Mac. Throughout 2006 Brady toured with Scottish singer Freddie Stevenson across the USA and Europe, as well as featuring on the most recent Solomon Burke record Nashville, and on the latest Waterboys record Book of Lightning. Brady announced that he will be touring Taiwan and China, conducting drum clinics and seminars in conjunction with Mapex Drums and Avedis Zildjian Company, throughout May and June. In early 2013, Brady gathered several musicians, including Jakob Dylan, Dave Matthews, Charlie Sexton, and Sexton's brother Will, to his studio in Shreveport to record. This jam session eventually led to the formation of a band called The Nauts with Blade, Dylan, Matthews, and the Sexton brothers as members. They are currently working on their debut album. In summer 2014, Brady appeared on Late Show with David Letterman as a drummer, performing alongside artist John Doe. ==Business ventures== In 2005 Brady founded record label Brick Top Recordings LLC.

Although the group supports all women in domestic services, its primary focus is on women from South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal). Workers' Awaaz was founded in June 1997 by a group of South Asian women activists and domestic workers. Workers' Awaaz assists workers in ensuring that they are paid the minimum wage, receive overtime pay, are aware of their rights under workers' compensation laws, and receive training in basic employee rights and protection under state and federal law. The organization also sues employers on behalf of domestic workers for violations of federal and state laws, and organizes pickets and demonstrations against abusive employers. Workers' Awaaz also works to build public awareness of the sometimes abusive conditions under which many South Asian domestic workers labor in the U.S. Since many immigrant domestics are isolated by language, working conditions and restrictions placed on them by employers, Workers' Awaaz uses a variety of outreach efforts to reach workers in need. It places advertisements in various South Asian-related newspapers, sets up tables at South Asian community events, and engages in face-to-face conversations in markets and stores. ==Lawsuits== Workers' Awaaz has won several lawsuits filed on behalf of workers against employers who did not pay minimum wage, withhold taxes or make Social Security and other required government payments. In 1998, Workers' Awaaz, working with the American Civil Liberties Union, won a $20,000 back pay settlement. In January 2000, the organization won a back pay award for $50,000 from physicians who refused to pay a domestic worker for nearly three years. ==Awards and grants== In 1997, Workers' Awaaz won a $5,000 grassroots grant from the Ben & Jerry's Foundation. In 1998, Ahmed was honored as a fellow of the Petra Foundation for her advocacy work with Workers' Awaaz. In 2000, the organization was awarded a Union Square Award from the Tides Center for its grassroots activism and strengthening of immigrant communities in New York City. In 2000, Shahbano Aliani, M. Bala, Shahensha Begum, Rekha Devi, Rokeya Mollah and Rokeya Begum‚Äîlead organizers and board members‚Äîreceived the Union Square Award from the Fund for the City of New York. ==References== *Akhter, Nargis; Alam, Nahar; and Bhattacharjee, Anannya. \\"Behind Swinging Door: South Asian Restaurant Workers Speak.\\" SAMAR: South Asian Magazine for Action and Reflection.

The crowd that assembled to watch the 1912 FA Cup Final was some 15‚Äì20,000 smaller than previous years but they still filled the ground and there was little spare space. Some spectators took to the trees around the ground and a group of WBA supporters tried to launch a blue and white striped hot air ballon but it burned before it left the ground. This failed stunt became a metaphor for a game that also failed to rise to meet the spectators expectations. Barnsley did not play an exciting game of football; relying on their half backs to run alongside the WBA forwards making the WBA game of pass and return between their forwards and half backs too dangerous. Barnsley then tried to score on the break. But the WBA backs, led by Pennington, were able to contain the threat. This led to a stalemate, with WBA unable to play their normal game and Barnsley unable to push their advantage. WBA had a couple of chances early in the first half when Cooper, the Barnsley goalkeeper, fumbled a shot from Baddeley but he did not have any support. Cooper was again tested when Jephcott centred the ball several times but again WBA did not press home the advantage. Barnsley had similar problems exploiting an advantage when Tufnell and Bartrop got through unmarked on the right wing. The Manchester Guardian felt that WBA had the better run of play in the first half but by the end of the second half felt the teams were evenly matched. There were some exciting moments towards the end. The first came when Pearson, the WBA goalkeeper mishandled a centring pass from Moore and Barnsley managed two shots the first rebounding from a WBA player, the second from the woodwork. Moments from the end of the match Buck a WBA player had his best chance but hit a goal post. The third drawn FA Cup Final in as many years drew aggravated comments from the departing crowds. The Manchester Guardian felt the best players were the backs and half backs on each side, singling out Pennington and Buck on the WBA side for praise and Downs along with Glendinning for Barnsley. They also felt that Jephcott, the WBA wing had had a good match, with several good centring passes. ==Match details== { width=92%  -   } { width=\\"100%\\" style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"70%\\" { width=100% cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" border=0 colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"200\\" !! - GK   Jack Cooper - FB   Dickie Downs - FB   Archie Taylor (c) - HB   Bob Glendenning - CH   Philip Bratley - HB   George Utley - OF   Wilfred Bartrop - IF  Harry Tufnell - CF  George Lillycrop - IF  George Travers - OF   Jimmy Moore - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\" Arthur Fairclough } valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"30%\\" { cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" width=100% align=center colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"200\\" !! - GK   Hubert Pearson - FB   Arthur Cook - FB   Jesse Pennington (c) - HB   George Baddeley - CH   Fred Buck - HB   Bobby McNeal - OF   Claude Jephcott - IF   Harry Wright - CF   Bob Pailor - IF   Sid Bowser - OF   Ben Shearman - colspan=4Secretary-manager: - colspan=\\"4\\"Fred Everiss } } ==Replay summary== Albion's run in the cup, combined with several postponements from the early part of the season, meant that they were forced to play seven games in ten days at the end of the campaign. This included an away match at Everton on 22 April, in-between the final and the replay. Albion lost the match 3‚Äì0 with a reserve side and were fined ¬£150 by The Football League for fielding a weakened team, although nine of the eleven players had previously played in the league for the first team. To the frustration of the supporters the play during the replay was not much better than the original match. WBA's tactics had improved and they had the better of the play through most of the match but they failed to take their chances when they were presented. Pailor and Shearman missed a centring pass provided by Jephcott. Later in the second half Pailor almost got a shot past Cooper, who failed to control the ball, Glendinning saved the situation for Barnsley by kicking the ball into touch. Barnsley also tested the WBA goal, mainly Bartrop on the right wing. One of his shots in the first half had to be cleared off the line by Baddeley after Pearson fumbled the save. As the game ran into extra time, the Guardian commented that given the sunny and hot conditions the energy of the players was impressive and the pace of the game picked up. Apart from a brief attack on their goal by Travers and Moore the play was all with WBA until the last two minutes of extra time. Glendinning dribbled the ball out of a ruck in the Barnsley half and passed the ball to Tufnell, who was on the halfway line. Pennington, who had had an otherwise flawless game was bypassed as Tufnell kicked the ball past Penningtons right and then ran around his left side. Cook and Buck seeing the danger ran back, but they were too late. Within a few seconds Tufnell was in front of the goal. Pearson came off his line to narrow the angle and stamped his feet as he waited for the shot. Despite the pressure on him, Tufnell's shot was perfect; fast, low and out of Pearsons reach, it found the corner of the net. The Barnsley players hugged and kissed Tufnell as they celebrated his goal knowing that they could hold on for the final 2 minutes. The gate receipts for the replay were ¬£2615 and a collection was held for the Titanic Disaster Fund which received a total of ¬£49 1s 2d. The players travelled by motor back to Barnsley and were cheered through the streets of Sheffield as they held the cup to show the crowd. They arrived in Barnsley in the early evening to a great welcome. In discussing the players, the Guardian praised the Barnsley backs of Taylor & Downs, though Pennington for WBA also played well. Of the half backs Glendinning of Barnsley and McNeal from WBA judged to be the best on the day. When considering the WBA forwards Shearman, Bowser and Jephcot were praised, but Pailor in the centre had not made the best of the supply of crosses. Of the Barnsley forwards, Bartrop and Travers were the best. The victorious Barnsley team presented the match ball to Tiverton Preedy, the clergyman who had founded the club. It was displayed in his study until his death in 1928, whereupon it was returned to the club. ==Replay details== { width=92%  -   } { width=\\"100%\\" style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"70%\\" { width=100% cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" border=0 colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"200\\" !! - GK   Jack Cooper - FB   Dickie Downs - FB   Archie Taylor (c) - HB   Bob Glendenning - CH   Philip Bratley - HB   George Utley - OF   Wilfred Bartrop - IF  Harry Tufnell - CF  George Lillycrop - IF  George Travers - OF   Jimmy Moore - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\" Arthur Fairclough } valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"30%\\" { cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" width=100% align=right colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"200\\" !! - GK   Hubert Pearson - FB   Arthur Cook - FB   Jesse Pennington (c) - HB   George Baddeley - CH   Fred Buck - HB   Bobby McNeal - OF   Claude Jephcott - IF   Harry Wright - CF   Bob Pailor - IF   Sid Bowser - OF   Ben Shearman - colspan=4Secretary- manager: - colspan=\\"4\\"Fred Everiss } } { width=100% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" Match and replay rules *90 minutes. *Replay if necessary. *30 minutes of extra-time if scores still level. *No substitutes } ==References== ==External links== *Match report at www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk *FA Cup Final lineups *FA Cup Final kits 1912 FA Cup Category:Barnsley F.C. matches Category:West Bromwich Albion F.C. matches FA Cup Final FA Cup Final Category:20th century in Sheffield ","title":"1912 FA Cup Final"},{"id":"9129901","text":"Linda Lepomme (born 16 March 1955) is a Belgian actress and singer who represented her country in the Eurovision Song Contest 1985 in which she sang \\"Laat me nu gaan\\".

It was the first American sailing ship built in what is now the U.S. state of Oregon. Pioneer settlers built the ship from 1840 to 1842 in order to sail it to California and exchange it for livestock. During World War II a Liberty ship was named the SS Star of Oregon in honor of the 19th century sailing vessel. ==Vessel design== Felix Hathaway, an experienced ship's carpenter and former employee of the Hudson's Bay Company, designed the Star of Oregon with input from Joseph Gale, an American fur trapper with deep water sailing experience. The Star was a small Baltimore clipper schooner, a highly maneuverable vessel with a shallow draft that Gale would have been familiar with as a boy living on the Chesapeake Bay. Gale provided a detailed description of the Star in a letter to James W. Nesmith: ==Construction== Construction of the Star of Oregon began in the autumn of 1840 with Felix Hathaway supervising, and John Canan, Ralph Kilbourne, Pleasant Armstrong, Henry Woods, Josiah Lamberson Parrish, George Davis, and Jacob Green providing less skilled labor. The crew began construction of the schooner on the east side of Swan Island (part of today's Portland, Oregon). In the spring of 1841, the project was jeopardized when Hathaway quit because of the group's inability to pay him, the advent of other more promising business opportunities, and his frustration over the lack of needed building materials. At the time of Hathaway's resignation, the keel of the schooner had been finished to just above the water line. At this time, John Canan and Ralph Kilbourne went back to Joseph Gale and reminded him of his promise to assist on the project and serve as captain once they got further along in the building. Gale then went and inspected the ship to determine if it would be seaworthy, and after determining it was, he went home and sold his farm and farming equipment. After moving his family to Champoeg, Oregon, Gale then devoted much of the next year to completing the vessel. On May 19, 1841 the partially completed vessel was launched and moved up the Willamette River to near Oregon City. In the fall of 1841, George Davis and Henry Woods dropped out of the project, which reduced the number of partners to five. Kilbourne and Gale did most of the remaining work, while Thomas J. Hubbard did the blacksmithing. Although wood was plentiful in Oregon, construction of a ship required cordage, cloth for sails, and a range of other materials that were available only from the Hudson's Bay Company store at Fort Vancouver. John McLoughlin, Chief Factor at Fort Vancouver, was ill-disposed to provide these. In serious trouble, the project was rescued by Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, Commander of the United States Exploring Expedition, who arrived in Oregon at about the time that Gale joined the project. Wilkes asked McLoughlin to sell the needed materials to the Americans as a personal favor, and the Chief Factor obliged. As a result, the project \\"purchased an ample supply of all the necessities that we needed, such as cordage, canvas, paints, oils, etc., etc., for which we paid the company in wheat and furs of different kinds.\\" Work on the vessel continued until late October 1841, when the project was suspended for the winter and spring. In June 1842, work on the schooner resumed and the vessel was ready to sail in mid-August, nearly two years after the beginning of construction. ==California voyagesSale=== On reaching Yerba Buena, today's San Francisco, Gale and company found a man in need of a ship, Joseph Yves Limantour. In October 1841, the French merchant's schooner Ayucucho had gone aground near Point Reyes. Although much of the cargo was saved, Limantour was stranded in California with no means of transport. During his time in northern California, Limantour sold his cargo for cash and credit to the local elite, but the value of the Ayucucho's cargo far exceeded the local capacity for purchase. General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, Commander General of California, was a major exception and he owned a substantial rancho in Sonoma with plenty of cattle. Gale and company wanted cattle, and Limantour wanted the schooner. In a three-way deal, Vallejo purchased the Star of Oregon for 350 cows, and then transferred ownership to Limantour. The Star of Oregon was renamed the J√≥ven Fanita in honor of General Vallejo's seven-year-old daughter, Epifania.\\" ===J√≥ven Fanita=== In late 1842, Limantour loaded the J√≥ven Fanita with \\"the remainder of his goods and effects and sailed down the coast, stopping at the ports of Monterrey, Santa Barbara and San Pedro.\\" On anchoring at San Pedro in January 1843, Limantour encountered demand for his cargo in the form of the newly appointed Governor of California, Manuel Micheltorena. Micheltorena had arrived in southern California in the summer of 1842 with several hundred ill-trained Mexican troops and little provision for their support. The Governor was desperate for cash and goods to support his army and to spare the locals their depredations. Micheltorena requested cash and merchandise in exchange for a draft of Mexican funds to be honored at Mazatl√°n. Limantour provided these (either voluntarily or under duress) and then sailed to Mazatl√°n at the Governor's request. He then returned with a second cargo of goods for Micheltorena, which was purchased with $10,221 in Mexican funds. Later, the Mexican government reimbursed Limantour $56,184 for the goods \\"confiscated\\" from the J√≥ven Fanita. Although the number of trips to and from Mexico in the small schooner is unclear, Limantour continued to use the schooner until it \\"became a total wreck.\\" ==See also== *Star of Oregon (event) ==References== Category:Oregon Country Category:Age of Sail merchant ships of the United States Category:Ships built in Portland, Oregon Category:1842 ships Category:Pre-statehood history of Oregon ","title":"Star of Oregon (ship)"},{"id":"9129931","text":"Sonja Lumme (born 6 October 1961, in Kristinestad) is a singer in Finland who represented her country in the Eurovision Song Contest 1985 in which she sang El√§k√∂√∂n el√§m√§.

The story is about the Gruffalo's child (a daughter) who, despite her father's warning, sets off into the \\"deep dark wood\\" to find the \\"big bad mouse\\", the only thing her father is afraid of. During her winter journey, she encounters the tracks of snake, owl, and fox from The Gruffalo, each of whom she first suspects to be the \\"big bad mouse\\", but who in turn tell her where she can find the real \\"big bad mouse\\". Eventually, concluding she has been tricked by the animals (and perhaps her father), she sadly admits that she \\"doesn't believe in the 'big bad mouse. At this point, she encounters the little mouse from The Gruffalo, who previously tricked her father. The mouse invites her to meet the \\"big bad mouse\\", which he re-creates by using moonlight to project a tremendously enlarged, fearsome shadow. Believing the shadow to belong to the real \\"big bad mouse\\", the Gruffalo's child flees and returns to the Gruffalo cave with faith in her father restored.

He fought as general in the battles against Kalyani Chalukyas and also against refractory vassals, Kalinga and Chakrakuta, who joined with Kalyani Chalukyas. He assumed the title Chola Mula Stambha (The pillar of Chola empire). His kingdom included the region from Gundlakamma in south to Tripurantakam in West. Rajendra Choda I succeeded his father as the chieftain and continued his allegiance to Later Cholas. He was defeated by Anantapalaya, the general of Vikramaditya VI of Kalyani Chalukyas in 1115 AD. Rajendra Choda I was forced to accept the suzerainty of Kalyani Chalukyas. Someswara III succeeded his father Vikramaditya VI in Kalyani in 1126 AD and Rajendra Choda I continued their allegiance to Kalyani Chalukyas. Malla Bhupati of Vengi recovered some regions on the banks of Krishna, but Velanti Chodas remained as subjects of Someswara II in these battles. However, in 1132 AD, he fought along the side of Later Cholas. Vikrama Chola sent his army under his son Kulothunga II to Vengi. Many chieftains including Velandu Chodas joined hands with him and helped in driving out Kalyani Chalukyas in the battle of Manneru. Rajendra Choda I died in the same year and Gonka II succeeded his father. He was regarded as greatest among of all Chodas and also fought as general in earlier battles during his father reign. He accompanied Kulothunga Chola II in many battles like famous Godavari battle that resulted in recovering all regions from Kalyani Chalukyas. He crushed many rebel chieftains like Chodas of Nellore and Konidena. His kingdom included the region between Mahendragiri in north and Srisailam in south. Prola II of Kakatiyas attacked his kingdom in 1158 AD. Chodayaraja, chief of Gonaka II killed Prola II and annexed lost regions. Gonaka II assumed many titles like Chalukyarajya MulaStambha. While glory of Velanati Chodas continued during the next two kings Rajendra Choda II and Gonka III and although they defeated all rebellions from north and west, they lost control of some regions. Many warriors were slain in the battle of Palanadu between the families of Haihayas, relatives and vassals of Velanati Chodas. The kingdom lost land from Srisailam to Tripurantakam to Rudradeva of Kakatiyas. The last great king in the dynasty is Pruthviswara. He ruled from Pithapuram and made several attempts to regain land and lost prestige. When kakatiyas were fighting against the Yadavas, he recovered the Velandau. However starting from 1201 AD, he lost to Kakatiyas and their subjects Nellore Chodas and was slain in a battle with Ganapatideva of Kakatiyas in 1207 AD. His son Rajendra Choda III made further attempts and lost entire kingdom to Ganapatideva. == Rulers == ==Culture == The region was between Krishna and Godavari rivers.

Her much praised Century of Struggle: The Woman's Rights Movement in the United States, originally published in 1959, relates women's physically courageous and politically ingenious work for the vote to other 19th- and early 20th-century social, labor, and reform movements, most importantly the push for equal education, the abolition of slavery, and temperance laws. ==Family== Flexner was the younger of two highly intelligent daughters of well-known parents. Her mother, Anne Crawford Flexner (1874-1955), a successful playwright and children's author, organized professional playwrights into an association that later became the Dramatists Guild of the Author's League of America. Eleanor's father, Abraham Flexner (1866-1959), was a leader in several fields including, with his brother Simon Flexner at the Rockefeller Institute, the reform of early 20th-century medical education and medical research in the United States and Canada. Abraham founded and served as first director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. His ideas for the structure and purpose of the institute so appealed to theoretical physicist Albert Einstein that Einstein chose it over competing university appointments when he emigrated from Germany to the United States in 1933. Eleanor's sister, Jean Flexner, became one of the first employees of the Division of Labor Standards in Washington, DC. Encouragement and financial assistance from her parents carried Flexner through the Great Depression and gave her the means to experiment as a playwright and social organizer. Her mother at her death left Eleanor a lifetime income. Both Anne and Abraham Flexner were feminists who supported passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and both marched in the 1915 New York woman suffrage parade. ==Career== Eleanor Flexner was born in Georgetown, Kentucky, but spent her youth in New York City. A biographical statement in the Schlesinger Library Archives at Harvard University outlines Flexner's early career: During this period of her life Flexner found her way into New York's radical left. She joined the Communist Party in 1936 and spent several years writing CP articles and pamphlets, under pseudonyms, and working for various social and political causes. As a member of the League of American Writers, she served on its Keep America Out of War Committee in January 1940 during the period of the Hitler-Stalin pact.Franklin Folsom, Days of Anger, Days of Hope, University Press of Colorado, 1994, This activist background allowed Flexner to appreciate the disappointments, triumphs, and bracing camaraderie experienced by the 19th- and early 20th- century women whom she later described in Century of Struggle. In the 1940s, Flexner began researching the 19th-century labor struggles of American women but found that few historians had touched on the subject. She was by that time already planning to write a history of the American woman suffrage movement and gradually became convinced that a comprehensive treatment must deal with the experiences of working class women and politically active women of color. Flexner worked on the manuscript that was to become Century of Struggle through most of the 1950s. When she showed the completed book to the historian Arthur Schlesinger, he recognized its value and urged her to offer it to Harvard University Press, which readily accepted it for publication. It was published in 1959. Many of the concepts that inform Century of Struggle were developed by a small group of Marxist women ‚Äî including, in addition to Flexner, Susan B. Anthony II, Gerda Lerner, and Eve Merriam. It was only in 1982, however, that Flexner publicly acknowledged her past membership in the Communist Party. In 1957, Flexner moved from New York to Northampton, Massachusetts, where her life partner, Helen Terry, was on the faculty of Smith College. Flexner completed Century of Struggle and wrote her last book, Mary Wollstonecraft, in this setting. ==Major work== *American Playwrights, 1918-1938: The Theatre Retreats from Reality, (1938, 1966; reprinted in 1969 with a new preface by Eleanor Flexnor). *Century of Struggle: The Women's Rights Movement in the United States, (1959, expanded edition 1975; enlarged edition 1996 co-authored with Ellen Fitzpatrick, who also wrote a biographically valuable foreword). *Mary Wollstonecraft: A Biography (1972). ==Further reading== *Thomas Neville Bonner, Iconoclast: Abraham Flexner and a Life in Learning.

Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001. ==Capsule summaries of Flexner's booksAmerican Playwrights, 1918-1938=== From Flexner's 1969 preface: Plays evaluated in American Playwrights are by dramatists Sidney Howard, S.N. Behrman, Maxwell Anderson, Eugene O'Neill, by comedy writer George S. Kaufman (variously collaborating with Marc Connelly, Edna Ferber, Moss Hart, Herman Mankiewicz, Morrie Ryskind, Howard Dietz, Katherine Dayton, and others), and by comedy writers George Kelly, Rachel Crothers, Philip Barry, and Robert E. Sherwood. In the penultimate chapter, \\"The New Realism,\\" brief attention is given to Susan Glaspell, Arthur Richman, Elmer Rice, Sophie Treadwell, John Howard Lawson, Paul Green, Paul & Claire Sifton, George Sklar & Albert Maltz, Paul Peters & George Sklar, John Wexley, Clifford Odets, Albert Bein, Irwin Shaw, Emanuel Eisenberg, Sidney Kingsley, Marc Blitzstein, and Ben Bengal. Flexner regrets in her 1969 preface to the book that she did not include Lorraine Hansberry, Arthur Miller, and Lillian Hellman among the playwrights singled out for special notice. ===Century of Struggle: The Women's Rights Movement in the United States=== Century of Struggle, originally published in 1959, became a point of departure for generations of historians who built the field of women's history. Professor Ellen Carol DuBois (UCLA) wrote in 1991 that Century of Struggle \\"has stood for thirty years as the most comprehensive history of American feminism up to the enfranchisement of women in 1920.\\" Ellen Fitzpatrick (University of New Hampshire), another leading scholar and co-author of the 1996 enlarged edition, wrote: ===Mary Wollstonecraft: A Biography=== Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin (1759-1797) was an English feminist, writer, and philosopher. There are at least three sources of her continuing renown in Britain and America: She is the author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792). She opposed the eminent Edmund Burke's views concerning the French Revolution in her A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) and was present in Paris in 1793 when England and France declared war. Finally, she is the mother of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin Shelley, who wrote Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus (1818). In this classic biography, which has not been reprinted, Flexner recounts the glories and miseries of Wollstonecraft's childhood and professional life. She describes Wollstonecraft's crushing self-doubt and unstable temperament, as well as her capacity for hard work even in times of significant adversity. Drawing on contemporary letters and diaries, Flexner adds new material to earlier lives of Wollstonecraft, especially concerning Wollstonecraft's literary friendships and her relations with her sisters and brothers. ==Notes== Thomas Neville Bonner's Iconoclast and Ellen Fitzpatrick's foreword to the 1996 edition of Century of Struggle were the major sources of information about the Flexner family.

The 1915 FA Cup Final took place on 24 April 1915 and was contested by Sheffield United and Chelsea. It was the last FA Cup final to be staged before competitive football was suspended in Britain because of the First World War. The match was moved from its pre-war location of Crystal Palace in south London to Old Trafford in Manchester to avoid disruption to travel in and around London. The match is one of the few FA Cup Finals that has acquired a name; the Khaki Cup Final, owing to the large number of uniformed soldiers in attendance. However, the attendance of about 50,000 was lower than previous years as a result of wartime travel restriction and the mobilisation of large numbers of young men into the armed forces. ==Road to the Final== Chelsea had the easiest start in the FA Cup competition, their first round match was with Swindon Town, a Southern Football League team, but they made heavy work of it requiring a replay to defeat them and conceding 3 goals during the two matches. Their Cup performance improved considerably, and after defeating Arsenal (then a Second Division side) in the second round, they defeated several First Division sides who finished above them in the league table, including Everton who later went on to win the league that season. Sheffield United defeated Blackpool, a second division side, in the first round and then made steady progress until round 4 where they met Oldham Athletic, who finished above them in the First Division that season, and they required a replay to finally defeat them. Sheffield United met Bolton Wanderers in the semi-final and Utley, the Blades' Captain, scored a rare goal. {width=100% width=50% valign=top ===Sheffield United=== Home teams listed first.

They had combined a successful FA Cup run with a strong league campaign where they finished 6th overall but only three points behind the League winners. Their defence was one of the best in the league but they had not managed to score many goals. Chelsea were statistically the weaker side, whilst they had scored more goals than Sheffield United in the league, their defence was poor and they had conceded many more and lay in the relegation zone. They had however beaten several strong clubs away from home during the FA Cup competition and the programme noted that the underdogs had won on six occasions in the previous ten years. Chelsea also had injury problems: Bob Thomson, their leading goal scorer that season, had been injured in a league game at Bolton Wanderers ten days earlier and was doubtful. Vivian Woodward an amateur and England international who played for Chelsea in peacetime but was currently serving in the British Army, had been given leave to play in the final. However Woodward sportingly insisted that as Thomson had helped the club reach the final, he ought to play in it. There was bad news when Thomson suffered an eye injury, but he played. ==Match programme== The official match programme was produced by Manchester United and is available on-line here. A special version was printed on silk for presentation to the players and officials. The programme showed that both teams played a 2‚Äì3‚Äì5 formation and the Chelsea teamsheet listed Vivian Woodward and Laurence Abrams in addition to those who played in the match. Neither played in the match. ==Match summary== As the score line suggests, the match was very much a one-sided affair. Chelsea adopted a gentlemanly \\"Drawing Room\\" style of play with attacks made up of zig-zag passes. These were broken up by an alert and cooperative Sheffield United defence. The Sheffield United forwards, with their superior tactics, pace and fitness, had the run of the Chelsea half and only the excellent performance of Molyneux, in goal for Chelsea, saved them from further embarrassment. Contemporary reports singled out Brelsford, Simmons and Utley of Sheffield United for their quality of their performances during the match and Logan, who made some unsuccessful attacks for Chelsea during the second half. The first goal was scored by Simmons just before half-time. A ball in from the left hand side crossed over the Chelsea backs and Simmons, racing in from the right half, half-volleyed it into the top of the net. Some sources suggest that Molyneux should have stopped this goal but others state that he was let down by his defence in all three goals. Chelsea had their best chances just before half-time when they had two shots saved by Gough in the Blades' goal. At some point Chelsea woes were added to when Harry Ford on the right wing was injured. Play was muted at the start of the second half as a thick fog descended over the pitch, preventing spectators from seeing any action on the opposite side of the pitch, though The Times commented that they were not missing much. The final two goals were scored in the last ten minutes. A shot from Wally Masterman rebounded from the bar but Fazackerly headed it past the Chelsea keeper for United's second. Directly after this goal Joe Kitchen picked the ball up just inside the Chelsea half and passed two defenders. Molyneaux emerged from the Chelsea goal but Kitchen dodged him and placed the ball in the open net. At this point, before the final whistle, large numbers of the spectators began to leave. The crowd included many men in uniform but a much larger contingent who, the Manchester Guardian commented, should have been in uniform. A number of wounded soldiers, one missing an arm, watched the match from lower stand. The cup was awarded by the Earl of Derby whose speech, largely drowned out by a noisy crowd of young supporters, noted that all present needed to join together and play \\"a sterner game for England\\". The Irwell Old Prize band provided the half time entertainment, playing a selection of tunes from around the British Isles. A collection was made during the match on behalf of the British Red Cross. ==Match details== { width=92%  -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Harold Gough - FB 2 Billy Cook - FB 3 Jack English - HB 4 Albert Sturgess - CH 5 Bill Brelsford - HB 6 George Utley (c) - OF 7 Jimmy Simmons - IF 8 Stanley Fazackerley - CF 9 Joseph Kitchen - IF 10Wally Masterman - OF 11Bob Evans - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\" John Nicholson }  valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=center colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Jim Molyneux - FB 2 Walter Bettridge - FB 3 Jack Harrow (c) - HB 4 Fred Taylor - CH 5 Tommy Logan - HB 6 Andy Walker - OF 7 Harry Ford - IF 8 Harold Halse - CF 9 Bob Thomson - IF 10Jimmy Croal - OF 11Bob McNeil - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\"David Calderhead } } { width=100% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" Match rules *90 minutes. *30 minutes of extra-time if necessary. *Replay if scores still level. *No substitutes } ==Aftermath== In July 1915, the Football League put all players on amateur status and clubs were only allowed to pay expenses. Attendances at matches collapsed and as fuel for transport became scarce the national league was abandoned and football teams played in regional leagues with whatever players they could find. Chelsea often played with players from other sides who passed through London whilst on active service, including Stanley Fazackerley. Sheffield United held the FA Cup until it was contested again in 1920. They reached the final and won the cup again in 1925. Chelsea did not reach the final again until 1967 and finally won it in 1970 at Old Trafford in a replay 55 years later. ==References== ==External links== *Match report at www.fa-cupfinals.co.uk *FA Cup Final lineups *FA Cup Final kits 1915 FA Category:Sheffield United F.C. matches Category:Chelsea F.C. matches Category:April 1915 sports events ","title":"1915 FA Cup Final"},{"id":"9130105","text":"BeTipul (; lit.

If properly prepared, a rolag will be uniform in width, distributing the fibres evenly. The word derives from the Scottish Gaelic word for a small roll.

He was the eldest son of Ellis Price MP, of Plas Iolyn, Pentrefoelas, Denbighshire. ==Life== He followed a seafaring life for many years, joining expeditions under both Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Francis Drake. In one of his poems he states that he, Captain William Myddelton and Captain Thomas Koet were the first who ‚Äòdrank‚Äô (smoked) tobacco in the streets of London. He fought in the campaign in the Netherlands between 1585 and 1587 under Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, and was also with the earl at Tilbury in the army that protected London from the Spanish Armada in 1588. He was also occupied as a buccaneer; at the end of the 16th century he bought a ship and went buccaneering on the Spanish sea routes from the Ll≈∑n coast, having built a residence out of the ruins of the old monastery on Bardsey Island. On his death, Prys was buried at Ysbyty Ifan on 23 August 1634. ==Works== Manuscript by Prys Many details survive about Tomos‚Äôs life, recorded in his poems, of which more than two hundred are extant. Many of these poems describe his adventures as a soldier who faced the Spanish Armada and fought in the French Wars of Religion. A poem written by Tomos at Plas Iolyn in his later life: ==Family== Prys was twice married; firstly to Margaret, the daughter of William Griffith of Caernarvon, with whom he had three children, and secondly to Jane, the daughter of Hugh Gwynn of Berth-ddu and Bodysgallen, with whom he had ten children. According to his will, he disinherited his eldest son, Thomas, for marrying without his consent, so the manor of Ysbyty Ifan was left to the eldest son by his second wife, Robert. ==References== *Dictionary of National Biography Category:1560s births Category:1634 deaths Category:Welsh- language poets Category:Welsh soldiers Category:16th-century Welsh writers Category:16th-century male writers Category:17th-century Welsh writers Category:17th-century male writers Category:High Sheriffs of Denbighshire ","title":"Tomos Prys"},{"id":"9130215","text":"This is a list of viscountcies in Portugal: ==A== #

Guard as host was joined each Sunday night with Dave's Place Group, performing several folk songs. The series was set in a tropical South Pacific tea house, where popular folk guest performers entertained on the club's small stage. Queenie Paul, the well-known Australian comedian, played the recurring part of an out-of-touch, aged bar fly who was seen preferring to watch TV than to engage in the show. Glamorous, exotic hostesses served the patrons while they listened to the folk and jazz ensembles. The showed was telecast in 1965 for thirteen episodes. ==Dave's Place Group== Dave's Place Group performed with Guard singing several traditional folk songs on the shows. The members were Dave Guard, Chris Bonett on bass, Len Young on drums. The female singers were Kerrilee Male (who later recorded in London as a member of folk rock group Eclection), Frances Stone and Norma Shirlee Stoneman, each rotating in the trio over the various weekly shows. ==See also== * List of Australian music television shows ==External links== * *Dave's Place Group *Dave's Place History Category:Australian variety television shows Category:Australian music television series Category:Musical groups established in 1965 Category:Australian folk singers ","title":"Dave's Place"},{"id":"9130227","text":"The men's 300 metre military rifle from three positions (originally called individual competition with army rifle) was a shooting sports event held as part of the Shooting at the 1912 Summer Olympics programme.

Tadeusz returns to Krak√≥w to discover if Jedrek may be alive. His wife and son Maciek were members of resistance - was it possible that the second son may have been the traitor? During Maciek's struggle to explain to his father their history during German occupation, questions arise concerning collaboration with the Gestapo and retribution by the Home Army. Has pictures the mystical lost boy in a dark fairy-tale forest, full of the war's ghosts and wholesale executions.

He received the OBE for his work on the scabies mite. ==Life and work== Mellanby was educated at Barnard Castle School and then at King's College, Cambridge. He gained his PhD at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine on the ability of parasites to survive desiccation. He then worked as a Sorby Research Fellow of the Royal Society in Sheffield. In the Second World War, he studied the control of scabies mite, an infection that was keeping thousands of soldiers in hospital. He carried out research on volunteers, mainly conscientious objectors, at the Sorby Research Institute, which he founded. He showed that the mite was unable to survive in bedding, but was transferred only by close contact. He showed further that a single treatment with benzyl benzoate provided a prompt cure. In 1945, he was awarded the OBE for this work. Mellanby helped to found Nigeria's first University, the University of Ibadan, and was its first principal (1947‚Äì1953). Mellanby Hall, the university's first student hall of residence, is named after him.Tamuno 1981 On his return to England, he worked at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and then became head of the Entomology Department at Rothamsted Experimental Station. In 1961, Mellanby founded and served as director of the Monks Wood Experimental Station, an ecological research center in Huntingdon, England. He started the journal Environmental Pollution in 1970, and was the author of many books. Mellanby was a proponent for using DDT for the eradication of pests known to spread malaria. On p. 75 of his book The DDT Story, Mellanby famously wrote: == Bibliography == *Scabies. Oxford University Press, 1944. (2nd ed., Hampton, Classey, 1972. ) *Human Guinea Pigs.

He was capped 54 times for Wales during his career, at that time a record. He and Gareth Edwards, Rob Howley, Dwayne Peel and Mike Phillips are the only scrum halves to have achieved 50 caps or more for Wales. Jones attracted widespread admiration during his playing career for his invention and the quality of his passing, which was often referred to by pundits as the best in the world. In addition his box-kicking from the base of the scrum or line-out was a potent weapon, used to best effect during Wales' 1989 victory over England at Cardiff Arms Park and the subsequent Lions tour to Australia. His attractive style of play earned him many invitations to play for the Barbarians in addition to his club and international selections. He made his debut for Swansea RFC as a schoolboy and went on to play 286 games between 1983 and 2001/02, scoring 50 tries, and captaining them in 1989/90 and 1990/91. Jones also made an appearance for the British and Irish Lions against a Rest of the World XV in 1986. He formed a notable partnership for Wales with the outside-half Jonathan Davies before the latter's move to rugby league. Jones and Davies were important members of the Welsh team that won the Triple Crown in 1988. One of the most memorable tries of that championship came in the game against Scotland, when Jones supplied Davies with a long reverse pass, the latter then kicking ahead and beating his Scottish marker for pace to the goal line. Later in the same game Jones sent two high-quality passes to Davies under extreme pressure, enabling Davies to score a drop goal on each occasion and win Wales the match. In 1989 Jones was part of the victorious British and Irish Lions tour to Australia, enjoying some memorable confrontations with the Wallabies' scrum half Nick Farr-Jones. In 1993 he toured New Zealand with the British Lions. Jones also played for Western Province in South Africa during the 1994 Currie Cup tournament, forming a memorable partnership with South African fly- half Joel Stransky. He also played for English club Bristol, captaining them in 1997/98. Jones was succeeded at scrum-half for Wales by Rupert Moon, a move which attracted some controversy. Few would disagree that Jones was the more technically accomplished scrum-half. However, he was often playing behind a weak Welsh pack at the time and Moon was brought in because of his more physical attributes rather than for his superior scrum-half technique. Jones retired from international rugby after the 1995 World Cup in South Africa, and from all rugby in 2001. Since retiring, Jones can often be heard on BBC radio as a rugby pundit, and he was an assistant coach at the Llanelli Scarlets. For the past ten years he has featured regularly on television as both a pundit and commentator and has featured in many documentaries on a number of TV channels including BBC, Sky, ITV, Channel 4, S4C and RTE. He is a regular on the BBC Wales rugby programme 'Scrum V', both as a live commentator and as a pundit. He was a recurring guest on the S4C Welsh language chat show 'Jonathan', hosted by his Welsh half-back partner Jonathan Davies. ==References== ==External links== Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:People from Neath Port Talbot Category:Welsh rugby union players Category:Wales international rugby union players Category:British and Irish Lions rugby union players from Wales Category:Wales rugby union captains Category:Barbarian F.C. players Category:Swansea RFC players Category:Cardiff RFC players Category:Bristol Bears players Category:People educated at Cwmtawe Community School ","title":"Robert Jones (rugby union)"},{"id":"9130336","text":"Marko Antonio Cort√©s Mendoza (born 17 October 1977 in Zamora, Michoac√°n) is a Mexican politician affiliated with the National Action Party (PAN).

Alexander was educated at the Elgin Academy and King's College, University of Aberdeen, (M.A. 1851). He was a master for two years at a school at Elgin, and then for three years was in charge of St John's Grammar School, Hamilton. During this period the number of boys at the school increased from 194 to 397. Morrison married Christina (died 1883), daughter of Alexander Fraser, in 1855. In 1856 he accepted the position of headmaster of the Scotch College, Melbourne, after inaugural headmaster Robert Lawson had resigned. Morrison travelled in the Essex with his wife, a son and younger brother Robert (who later became vice principal at Scotch College 1869‚Äì1904). They arrived in Melbourne on 25 July 1857, and a week later began his duties. ==Career in Australia== When Morrison came to Melbourne there were only 50 day boys and six boarders at Scotch College, but in a few years it became one of the leading public schools in Australia, with a high reputation for scholarship. By 1870 enrolments had passed 300. In 1873 considerable additions were made to the school buildings, including a house for the principal, but following a severe illness in 1874 Morrison was given a year's leave of absence and travelled widely in Europe. He was appointed a member of the council of the University of Melbourne in 1878, and for the remainder of his life was one of the most regular attendants at its meetings. In November 1876 Morrison moved the motion at the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria which led to the founding of Ormond College at the University of Melbourne, and he largely influenced Francis Ormond in his endowing of the college. He worked hard himself in obtaining subscriptions when the college was instituted, was elected chairman of the trustees, and presided at the opening ceremony on 18 March 1881. In his earlier years at Scotch College, Morrison took classes in several subjects, but as the school increased in numbers his work became largely confined to administration. The University of Aberdeen conferred on Morrison the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws in 1876. He was the author of A First Latin Course. ==Legacy== Morrison was tall, stern-looking and had a black beard. He was a strict but just disciplinarian who, though he mellowed as he grew older, did not quite gain the affection of his boys in the same way as Lawrence Arthur Adamson, William Still Littlejohn and Albert Bythesea Weigall. He set a high standard of scholarship in the school and never lost his grip of the conduct of it. He trained and encouraged Frank Shew (1851-1934), who joined the staff in 1870 and for 53 years was beloved by succeeding generations of boys (see W. J. Turner's eulogy in Blow for Balloons, chapter XXVI.). Other distinguished masters were Weigall, Alexander Sutherland, and W. F. Ingram. This was perhaps the most important factor in Morrison's 47 successful years in charge of Scotch College, but his personality was felt in other ways in the school. His wide general interests enabled him to be an important figure in all matters relating to education in Victoria, whether at the council table of the university, or when preparing and giving evidence for a Royal Commission. Morrison died suddenly from heart failure on 31 May 1903, survived by four sons and three daughters. ==References== *E. L.

This enterprise by pioneers in the Willamette Valley of present-day Oregon consisted of building a ship they named Star of Oregon and then sailing it to California in order to bring back cattle to Oregon Country. The group was led by Joseph Gale and received assistance from Captain Wilkes of the United States Navy prior to setting sail on the open ocean. These pioneers were able to procure nearly 4,000 head of cattle, sheep, and horses combined. ==Background== In 1837 the Willamette Cattle Company had brought over 600 head of cattle to Oregon via California. Prior to this, virtually all cattle in the region were owned by the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). While the events of 1837 had broken the HBC's monopoly, much of the cattle were owned by a select few such as Ewing Young, John McLoughlin, and the Methodist Mission. The independent settlers of the Willamette Valley were left in the same situation as before, so they met and came up with a plan to alleviate their need for cattle. This group of pioneers decided to build a ship, sail it to California, trade the ship there for cattle, and then drive the cattle overland back to Oregon. In the early stages Joseph Gale, as an experienced sailor, was asked to assist on the project and serve as captain once they got further along in the building. ==Ship construction== Construction of the ship began in 1840 on Swan Island in present-day Portland, Oregon. There the ship was built under the guidance of Felix Hathaway, a ship's carpenter. On May 19, 1841, the ship was launched into the water, but only after Hathaway left the project for the lack of pay. Construction then moved upriver to Oak Island to complete the vessel. As the area lacked many industries at the time, supplies were difficult to acquire. This was made more difficult when the Hudson's Bay Company's Doctor John McLoughlin denied the shipbuilders the ability to purchase supplies from Fort Vancouver. McLoughlin refused, claiming that he did not think the boat would be seaworthy and even if it was able to set sail that the owners may attempt piracy with the ship. Therefore, the builders covertly procured supplies elsewhere, mainly through buying from other settlers. Additionally, the Methodist Mission‚Äôs blacksmith Josiah Lamberson Parrish would make metal spikes needed for the ship, plus Thomas J. Hubbard also made spikes for the ship. As construction progressed, the builders needed more and more materials to complete the boat. Coincidentally, in the summer of 1841 Captain Wilkes of the United States Navy arrived on the Columbia as part of the United States Exploring Expedition. While inland, he learned of the construction of the ship and the plans of the builders. Wilkes then impressed upon McLoughlin to change his position regarding the sale of supplies to the builders, including an offer to pay for any supplies the Americans were unable to buy. With this, McLoughlin then allowed the ship builders to buy the remaining items needed, namely canvas and rigging. Even with a seaworthy craft, the builders also needed to get official papers to allow them to freely sail the ocean. Once again Captain Wilkes was able to provide this necessity, but not before testing Captain Gale on his sailing and navigation skills. Gale passed the test, and Wilkes presented papers to the crew along with a compass, kedge anchor, log line, two log glasses, and an American flag. As October approached, the builders stopped for the winter. The next year, 1842, the ship was completed in August and Gale began training his crew as they sailed down the Willamette River. They named the completed vessel Star of Oregon, after which ship and crew set sail for California. The enterprise left the Willamette River on August 29, 1842 sailing by Fort Vancouver. As the ship progressed down the Columbia, Captain Gale continued training the others on sailing. On September 12, the Star of Oregon left the Columbia and entered the open ocean. The day before Gale met with Captain John H. Couch aboard Couch's brig Chenamus when Couch offered to Gale advice and to lead the way out of the mouth. ==Execution== Once on the ocean, Gale stayed at the helm for approximately 36 hours straight through the fog and rain. He wanted to sail out around from the coast and then head south, this due to the ship's lack of charts. While sailing south the ship nearly hit rocks as they cruised too close to shore in the fog. Then on September 17, 1842, the Star of Oregon and her crew reached San Francisco Bay. They stopped at the Old Presidio and presented their papers to the Mexican officials, who then allowed them to proceed to Yerba Buena. Once in Yerba Buena, now San Francisco, the passenger Mr. Pfeffenhauser disembarked to continue his journey to find his relative Captain Sutter. There the ship was sold to a Frenchman, Joseph Yves Limantour, in a three way transaction. Limantour was in need of a new vessel since in October 1841, the merchant's schooner Ayacucho had gone aground near Point Reyes. However, Limantour did not have cattle, but General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, Commander General of California, did have the cattle. Vallejo owned a substantial rancho in Sonoma with plenty of cattle. So in the deal Vallejo received merchandise from Limantour, the Oregonians received 350 head of cattle from Vallejo, and Limantour got the ship. The vessel was then renamed the J√≥ven Fanita in honor of General Vallejo's seven-year-old daughter, Epifania. However, the Oregon crew did not immediately head back north, as Gale thought it best to wait the winter out and attempt to recruit more people for the overland journey. Kilbourne then dropped out and decided to stay. Meanwhile, Gale sent out several circulars to attempt to recruit more people to settle in Oregon. Once spring came and the crew gathered at Cash Creek there were now a total of 42 people ready to head north to Oregon Country. This party started north with 1,250 head of cattle, 600 horses and mules, and 3,000 sheep. The journey overland took 75 days, and in mid May 1843, they arrived back in the Willamette Valley of the Oregon Country. ==Legacy== The enterprise brought the first Spanish merino sheep to Oregon, and allowed for greater economic independence of the pioneers. Gale was then elected to the provisional government of Oregon a few months later as one of three members of the executive committee at the Champoeg Meetings. ==ParticipantsShipbuilding=== Those participating in the construction of the vessel: *Known participants: George Davis, Henry Wood, Joseph Gale, Felix Hathaway, John Canan, Pleasant Armstrong, Ralph Kilbourne, Jacob Green ===Journey=== *Known participants: Joseph Gale, John Canan, Pleasant Armstrong, Ralph Kilbourne, Jacob Green. *Passenger: Charles Pfeffenhauser ==References== Category:Oregon Country Category:American frontier Category:Pre-statehood history of Oregon ","title":"Star of Oregon (event)"},{"id":"9130434","text":"The 1925 FA Cup Final was an association football match contested by Sheffield United and Cardiff City on 25 April 1925 at Wembley Stadium in London. The final was the showpiece match of English football's primary cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup), organised by the Football Association. Sheffield won the game with a single goal. Both teams entered the competition in the first round and progressed through five stages to reach the final. Sheffield conceded only two goals en route to the final, both in a 3‚Äì2 victory over local rivals The Wednesday in the second round. Cardiff also conceded twice before the final, once in the fourth round and once in the semi-final. They did however struggle to overcome Third Division North side Darlington in the first round, needing two replays to progress. This was the first time a team from outside England had reached an FA Cup final since Scottish side Queens Park played in the 1885 final. It was also the first time a Welsh team had reached the final of the competition. Nearly 92,000 spectators attended the final. The only goal of the game was scored by Sheffield United's Fred Tunstall after 30 minutes when he dispossessed Harry Wake on the edge of the Cardiff penalty area before shooting past goalkeeper Tom Farquharson. Cardiff were unable to respond and the match finished 1‚Äì0, giving Sheffield their fourth FA Cup triumph. The match remains the last time Sheffield have won the competition.

This set up a second round tie against local rivals The Wednesday in a match that was preceded by torrential rain and played, according to The Times, \\"practically underwater\\". Nevertheless, both teams attacked from the offset and The Wednesday took a two-goal lead in the opening ten minutes. United rallied and, after wasting several chances, goals from Tommy Sampy and George Green drew them level before half-time. Another goal by Sampy early in the second half gave United a 3‚Äì2 win. United were given another home tie in the third round where a single goal by Fred Tunstall was enough to give them a win over Everton in what was, at the time, a record attendance at Bramall Lane of 51,745. This figure was surpassed in the fourth round as 57,197 watched goals by Tunstall and Johnson give United a 2‚Äì0 home win against West Bromwich Albion. For United's next match they travelled to a neutral venue, Stamford Bridge in London, to face Second Division side Southampton. It was United's seventh appearance in the semi-final of the competition (and 100th cup tie overall) and nearly 70,000 fans attended the tie. An own goal late in the first half gave United the lead. After the break Southampton had a chance to draw level when Harry Pantling fouled Bill Rawlings in the penalty area. The resulting penalty was taken by Tom Parker but his shot was saved by Charles Sutcliffe. The penalty proved to be Southampton's only major opportunity in the match as they rarely troubled the opposition defence. Soon after the missed penalty, United added a second goal from Tunstall who broke through the defence to make it 2‚Äì0 and secure his side a place in the final. ===Cardiff City=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;float:right\\" !width=\\"25\\"  Round !width=\\"150\\"  Opposition !width=\\"50\\"  Score - !

In the first round of the cup they were drawn against Third Division North leaders Darlington. The first tie at Cardiff's ground, Ninian Park, ended in a goalless draw with the poor state of the pitch being blamed for a lack of excitement in the game. A replay at Darlington's Feethams ground drew a record crowd of more than 18,000 people for the club but again ended goalless. A third match was arranged at a neutral venue, Anfield in Liverpool, where Cardiff finally overcame their lower ranked opponents. Second-half goals from Len Davies and Willie Davies secured a 2‚Äì0 win and set up a home tie against Fulham. Cardiff's second round match was played in a heavy downpour that caused play to be suspended for ten minutes. A Len Davies goal late in the first half was enough to give Cardiff a 1‚Äì0 win. Cardiff travelled to Meadow Lane for their third round tie against Notts County which they won 2‚Äì0 with goals from Joe Nicholson, who replaced the injured Len Davies, and Jimmy Gill. Gill's goal drew considerable praise, Cardiff's match reporter described the play: \\"The goal by Gill was the finest exhibition of artistry ever seen... he eluded opponent after opponent, all after him like terriers and, when he placed the ball in the net, he gave Albert Iremonger no chance.\\" Cardiff hosted Leicester City in the fourth round where after a goalless first half Harry Beadles gave Cardiff the lead, only for Johnny Duncan to level the score. In the final minute, Willie Davies scored directly from a corner to send Cardiff through with a 2‚Äì1 win. This was the first season in English football that a new law allowed players to score direct from a corner kick. Davies was mobbed by supporters following the goal, but there remained confusion among other members of the crowd and Davies and teammate Jimmy Blair were forced to return to the field from the dressing room after the match to confirm to the crowd that Cardiff had won the tie. The semi-final saw Cardiff return to Meadow Lane as a neutral venue for their match with five-time winners Blackburn Rovers, who were also appearing in their twelfth semi-final. A close match had been predicted as both sides were similarly placed in the First Division table at the time, but early goals from Nicholson, Gill and Willie Davies gave Cardiff a 3‚Äì0 lead at half-time. John McKay replied for Blackburn with a headed goal after the break but the game finished 3‚Äì1 to Cardiff. By winning the match, Cardiff became the first Welsh team to reach an FA Cup final. ==MatchPre-match=== Ahead of the game, much of the focus of the national media centred on the idea of the FA Cup being won by a team from outside England for the first time. The last team based outside England to reach the final before this match was Scottish side Queen's Park who were defeated 2‚Äì0 by Blackburn Rovers in the 1885 final. A motion had been put forward in the early 1920s to bar Welsh clubs from competing in the FA Cup. Although this idea was rejected, the number of Welsh clubs allowed to compete was limited to 14 with The Football Association (FA) having the final say on selection. Cardiff City had joined the Football League in 1920 and quickly established themselves as one of the leading clubs in the competition. Before the 1925 final, Cardiff's best finish in the FA Cup had been as semi-finalists in the 1920‚Äì21 season. Sheffield United were appearing in their fifth final: they had won the competition in 1899, 1902 and 1915 and had been defeated in the 1901 final. Cardiff went into the match placed 13th, in the First Division, two points ahead of United. However, their opponents held the advantage in the two meetings between the sides, having drawn 1‚Äì1 at Ninian Park before winning the second fixture by a single goal. In its pre-match coverage, The Times reported that Cardiff's strength would lie in the team's defensive capabilities and noted that the team relied on the \\"soundness of the defence\\". Fred Keenor in particular was described as having \\"dominated every tie\\" leading up to the final, while fellow defenders Billy Hardy, Jimmy Blair and Jimmy Nelson and goalkeeper Tom Farquharson were also picked out as key to the team's success. Cardiff's forwards were deemed to be the weaker of the two sides. Largely due to his physical prowess, Joe Nicholson, a half back who had converted to playing as a forward during the campaign, was expected to start ahead of top scorer Len Davies who had recovered from injury. Nicholson had been in doubt ahead of the tie after injuring himself in the aftermath of Cardiff's semi-final victory over Blackburn. While attempting to escape from a throng of excited fans outside the ground, he had climbed onto the canvas roof of a taxi only to fall through and suffer a cut to his knee. Nevertheless, Cardiff were considered slight favourites heading into the game. In contrast, Sheffield United's forward players were deemed to be the team's strength by The Times, especially the inside-forward pairing of club captain Billy Gillespie and Fred Tunstall. The side's defence, however, were seen to be considerably weaker with The Times predicting that the match could \\"turn into an ordeal\\" for goalkeeper Sutcliffe, whose brother John had played in goal for Bolton Wanderers when they lost in the 1894 FA Cup Final. United's Tommy Boyle and Harry Johnson were appearing in their first FA Cup final. Their fathers, Peter Boyle and Harry Johnson Sr, had both won the FA Cup with United in 1902. Sampy, who had scored two goals in the competition, was dropped in favour of Boyle to provide more physicality in the forward line. The Express described the United side as \\"good cup fighters with a workmanlike rather than polished team\\". The 1925 final was the 50th hosting of the event. Despite Wembley Stadium having a capacity of 92,000, only 1,750 tickets were allocated to each side, although the FA did increase the number to 4,000 when Cardiff lodged an appeal. It is estimated around 40,000 Cardiff fans were able to secure tickets for the match through general sale. More than half of these arrived on 34 trains that were laid on by the Great Western Railway to carry fans from Cardiff to London from 9:30pm the previous day, with the last departing at 1:30am on the day of the game. A further 15 trains were laid on from the Birmingham and Wolverhampton areas and a further five from the Sheffield area. Before the match, the teams were presented to the Duke and Duchess of York by the president of The Football Association, Charles Clegg. The Duke and Duchess took up seats in the Royal Box for the match, accompanied by members of the FA. Former Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald was seated behind the Royal Box and accepted an offer for him and his acquaintances to take up seats in the Box at half-time. The bands of the Irish Guards and the Royal Air Force played the national anthem prior to the match and \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\" and other songs during the half-time interval. The referee for the match was G. N. Watson from the Nottinghamshire County Football Association and the linesmen were A. H. Kingscott from the Derbyshire County Football Association and R. T. Bradshaw from the Leicestershire and Rutland County Football Association. If the match ended in a draw, a replay was arranged for 29 April at Old Trafford in Manchester. ===Summary=== The match kicked-off at 3pm and started brightly, with the first 20 minutes providing the best football of the day according to The Times. Cardiff's Billy Hardy later noted how nervous he and his teammates were at the start of the match, describing the team as \\"shaking like kittens\\". United's forward pairing of Gillespie and Tunstall proved testing to the Cardiff defence early on and the majority of the opening period was spent in the Welsh side's half. Johnson nearly gave United the lead when he received David Mercer's cross unmarked in the opposition area but he was unable to immediately control the ball, which allowed Blair to close in and block his effort. Cardiff's best chance of the first half fell to Nicholson, who received the ball near the edge of the opposition penalty area. Despite having space to run into, Nicholson chose to shoot early but his effort went well over the bar. Nicholson caused issues for the United defence on the edge of their area that drew a foul from Ernest Milton on Willie Davies, but the resulting effort was wasted. Cardiff had few further opportunities in the first half; the Devon and Exeter Gazette described how Cardiff \\"placed the ball too square, so that speed was lost\\". Thirty minutes into the match, Gillespie's pass was intercepted by Harry Wake on the edge of Cardiff's penalty area. Rather than clear the ball, Wake hesitated in possession and was tackled by Tunstall who advanced on Cardiff goalkeeper Farquharson before scoring the opening goal of the match from . Tunstall nearly went through on goal a second time shortly after, but was quickly closed down by the Cardiff defence. The People noted that, based on the first half, the match \\"would have gone down to history as one of the best finals ever played\\", while The Express wrote that the first half was \\"not colourless by any means but it was not picturesque\\". Cardiff started the opening minutes of the second half more brightly but failed to capitalise on their brief ascendancy. Their most promising move of these early stages was ended when Harry Beadles was flagged offside. The best chance of the second half fell to United whose forward line had advanced on the Cardiff goal \\"practically unhampered\\". As the ball was sent across the Cardiff penalty area, three United players took misplaced swipes at the ball and failed to convert for a second goal. Cardiff's attempts to control the game were limited due to an apparent injury to Hardy that left him struggling to keep pace. Johnson sent a strong shot towards the Cardiff goal 15 minutes into the second half which Nelson blocked. The Sunday Pictorial described the two sides in the second half as \\"working hard without having, apparently, any definite aim in view\\". In the final minutes of the match, Cardiff desperately pressed for an equalising goal. One push forward by the side led to a penalty area scramble that saw three shots blocked by Sheffield defenders before Gill's final effort was \\"feeble and wide\\". Cardiff's forays forward also provided opportunities for United on the counter-attack; a free kick awarded for a foul on Johnson was wasted while Boyle forced a save from Farquharson late on before the referee blew the final whistle. ===Details=== { width=92%  -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"200\\" !! - GK  Charles Sutcliffe - DF  Billy Cook - DF  Ernest Milton - HB  Harry Pantling - HB  Seth King - HB  George Green - FW  David Mercer - FW  Tommy Boyle - FW  Harry Johnson - FR  Billy Gillespie (c) - FL  Fred Tunstall - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\"John Nicholson } valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=center colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"200\\" - GK  Tom Farquharson - DF  James Nelson - DF  Jimmy Blair - DF  Harry Wake - HB  Fred Keenor (c) - HB  Billy Hardy - HB  Willie Davies - FW  Jimmy Gill - FW  Joe Nicholson - FR  Harry Beadles - FL  Jack Evans - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\"Fred Stewart } } { width=100% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\"  width=50% valign=top Match officials: *Assistant referees: **A.

The team were presented with their winner's medals by the Duke and Duchess of York in the Royal Box and the trophy was awarded to United captain Gillespie. He described himself as \\"the happiest man in Britain\\" upon receiving the trophy. After the teams had left the field, the Lord Mayor of Cardiff, W. H. Pethybridge, visited the United dressing room to offer them his congratulations. United remained in London for two days before travelling to Liverpool for a match against Everton. The team returned to Sheffield on 28 April, where they were met by a crowd of thousands before being driven to the town hall where they displayed the trophy from the balcony of the building. As of 2020, United have reached only one further final since 1925, losing to Arsenal in 1936. Despite their defeat, some of Cardiff's players were carried from the field on the shoulders of the team's supporters. Cardiff defender Jimmy Nelson took home the match ball and later auctioned it in aid of Rookwood Hospital in Cardiff. A film of the final was flown to Cardiff immediately after the game and was shown on the evening of the final. The Cardiff team remained in London for two days after the final, returning to Cardiff on 27 April. The side were welcomed home by large crowds despite their defeat and attended a dinner with the Mayor of Cardiff the same evening. Harry Wake, who had lost possession for the only goal of the game, received considerable criticism for his performance after the match. The People remarked that this one fatal error wiped out many excellences on his part. However, his teammate Keenor absolved Wake of any blame in a post-match interview, stating \\"any blame should be shouldered by the rest of the defence of which I was one. A warning shout should have been given of Tunstall's first approach. Wake could not have been aware of it\\". Keenor remained bullish after the final, confidently predicting that \\"one day soon our followers can be sure that Cardiff City will bring that cup to Wales.\\" His prediction was realised two years later when he captained Cardiff to victory in the 1927 FA Cup Final to become the only team from outside England to win the competition. Wake was also part of the side that reached the 1927 final, but missed the game after suffering kidney damage in a league match two weeks earlier. ==ReferencesBibliography=== * * * Category:FA Cup Finals FA Cup Final 1925 FA Cup Final 1925 Category:Events at Wembley Stadium FA Cup FA FA Cup Final FA Cup Final ","title":"1925 FA Cup Final"},{"id":"9130445","text":"Cis or cis- may refer to: == Places == * Cis, Trentino, in Italy * In Poland: ** Cis, ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Voivodeship, south-central ** Cis, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, north == Math, science and biology == * cis (mathematics) (cis(Œ∏)), a trigonometric mathematical function related to Euler's formula * Cis (beetle), genus * Cis‚Äìtrans isomerism, in chemistry * cis-regulatory element, regions of non-coding DNA which regulate the transcription of nearby genes == Other uses == * Cisgender, in contrast with transgender * C‚ôØ (musical note), known as cis == See also == * CIS (disambiguation) * * Ciss (disambiguation) ","title":"Cis"},{"id":"9130450","text":"Mamurra (fl. 1st century BC) was a Roman military officer who served under Julius Caesar. ==BiographyEarly life=== Possibly named Marcus Vitruvius Mamurra (if we follow Thielscher's 1969 suggestion based on an inscription in Thibilis), he was an equestrian who originally came from the Italian city of Formiae.Pliny the Elder, Natural History 36.7 His family must have been prominent there, as Horace calls it \\"the city of the Mamurrae\\".Horace, Satires 1.5 ===Military career=== He served as praefectus fabrum (prefect of engineers) under Caesar in Gaul; a poem by Catullus also refers to his service in Britain as well as in Pontus and Hispania,Catullus, Carmina 29 suggesting he also served during the civil war. Among the engineering feats achieved by Caesar's army during this time, which Mamurra may have been a part of, include the rapid construction of a bridge over the Rhine in 55 BC,Julius Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 4.17-19 the designing and building of a new kind of ship for the second expedition to Britain in 54 BC,Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 5.1 and the double circumvallation of Alesia in 52 BC.Caesar, Commentarii de Bello Gallico 7.68-74 Mamurra's military service, and his patronage by Caesar, made him extremely rich.Cicero, Letters to Atticus 7.7 According to Cornelius Nepos (quoted by Pliny the Elder) he was the first Roman to have his entire house, which sat on the Caelian Hill, clad in marble, and the first to use solid marble columns. Catullus constructed the character of Mamurra as a foil to himself, that is, as standing for all things un-Roman, and unlike Catullus himself. Catullus attacked Mamurra's profligacy, womanising and scandalous lifestyle, nicknaming him \\"mentula\\" (a vulgar word for the penis) and accusing him of having a homosexual relationship with Caesar.Catullus, Carmina 57 This was regarded as a \\"lasting stain\\" on Caesar's character, but Catullus later apologised, and was immediately invited to dinner by Caesar.Suetonius, Julius Caesar 73 Catullus also refers in unflattering terms to Ameana, the mistress of \\"the bankrupt of Formiae\\", usually taken to mean Mamurra.Catullus, Carmina 41, 43 ===Later=== A letter of Cicero of 45 BC refers to Caesar giving no visible reaction when he heard news of Mamurra, which has been interpreted by some as referring to his death,Cicero, Letters to Atticus 13.52 although the reference is too ambiguous to be certain. ==See also== * Homosexuality in ancient Rome ==References== ==External links== * Catullus poem Category:1st-century BC Romans Category:Ancient Roman equites Category:Ancient Roman politicians Category:Ancient Roman soldiers Category:Ancient Romans involved in Julius Caesar's invasions of Britain Category:People from Formia Category:Roman people of the Gallic Wars Category:Military personnel of Julius Caesar Category:Lovers of Julius Caesar ","title":"Mamurra"},{"id":"9130463","text":"Cortado is a streaming Java applet for Ogg formats Vorbis, Theora and Kate, Œº-law, MJPEG and Smoke (a custom MJPEG variant), released under the GPL.

The band consists of Cheetie Kumar (guitar), David Mueller (bass), Scott Nurkin (drums), Paul Siler (guitar), Jason Alyward (drums) and Missy Thangs (keys). The band was formed after guitarists Paul Siler and Cheetie Kumar split from The Cherry Valence to join forces with vocalist, Craig Tilley, and bassist, David Mueller. They soon enlisted Chapel Hill drummer/artist Scott Nurkin and quickly made a name for themselves after their ‚Äô07 Volcom debut Bazaar Bazaar, ‚Äô08‚Ä≤s follow-up EP Outer Upper Inner. Relentless touring in support of these releases with the likes of The Racontuers, The Flaming Lips, Black Mountain, The Fucking Champs, Mudhoney, Monotonix, and Ted Leo, made BIRDS OF AVALON road vets‚Äîa band‚Äôs band with one of the best live rock shows going. The band then retreated to their home and began an extensive period of writing and recording, using their rehearsal space at Kumar and Siler's house as a makeshift studio. Recordings done at the home resulted in band's second full-length album, Uncanny Valley, released in summer 2009 on Volcom Entertainment. The album was quickly recorded on an old 3M 16-track tape machine borrowed from Mitch Easter who, with Cheetie Kumar, mixed the record at Fidelitorium. The name Uncanny Valley comes from a theory which was introduced by Japanese roboticist, Masahiro Mori, in 1970 to describe the phenomena by which human beings become more unsettled by robots or other human facsimiles in direct proportion to how lifelike they appear. Uncanny Valley was their final album for Volcom. It was recorded after actually completing another complete album just a couple of months previously. The band decided against releasing that one on Volcom feeling that the more spontaneous Uncanny Valley was a better match for the label. Much of 2010 was a transitional time for the group. Paul and Cheetie, along with co-owners Steve Popson (Polvo) and Ben Barwick (Ashley Stove), re- opened live venue Kings Barcade. Siler also kept busy booking Raleigh‚Äôs inaugural and highly successful Hopscotch Music Festival. All this on the heels of the amicable departure of vocalist Craig Tilley afforded the band an opportunity to re-evaluate and evolve their sound with a focus on group harmonies and a freer approach to writing and performing. In January 2011, the band released their third full length on Bladen County Records. The self- titled album, another analog-only collaboration with Mitch Easter (REM, Wilco, Pavement), draws on the pop-aesthetic of Bazaar Bazaar but blazes new progressive trails while anticipating the psychedelic experimentation of Uncanny Valley. Gigantic Music released the vinyl of the S/T LP in the Summer of 2011. In 2015 Birds Of Avalon joined forces with Missy Thangs (The Love Language) and Jason Alyward (Valient Thorr) to include synth and a second drummer.

He was arrested in August 2006 and jailed in January 2007 for intercepting mobile phone messages involving members of the Royal Household. ==Biography== Goodman initially worked as a journalist on Nigel Dempster's gossip column in the Daily Mail, before joining the News of the World as royal editor. He was among the tabloid journalists covering the breakdown of the marriage of Diana, Princess of Wales and Prince Charles, and at the time held the News of the World record for number of consecutive front page splashes, with five. In March 2005 Goodman took over Mark Bolland's \\"Blackadder\\" column, reporting on details and rumours of the lives of notable personalities. It was during his tenure on this column that two entries raised suspicions with Royal Household staff that Goodman had gained access to the Royal Family's voicemails. On 26 January 2007 Goodman was imprisoned for four months, having pleaded guilty to illegally intercepting phone messages from Clarence House; his co-conspirator Glenn Mulcaire was sentenced to six months. Goodman was sacked by the News of the World in January 2007, but within a year he received ¬£240,000 in settlements, from News International. According to News International the payments were made because his dismissal was unfair as they had failed to \\"follow statutory procedures\\" in sacking Goodman. Goodman was arrested again, along with Andy Coulson, on 8 July 2011 after new revelations of the phone hacking were made public. It was announced that the News of the World would end its 168-year publication history on 10 July 2011. Goodman was on trial in 2013‚Äì14 along with Coulson, Rebekah Brooks and a number of other former News of the World reporters and executives. The jury was unable to reach verdicts on two charges of conspiring to cause misconduct in public office in relation to the alleged purchase of confidential royal phone directories in 2005 from a palace police officer. On 30 June 2014 the trial judge, Mr Justice Saunders, announced that Goodman and the News of the Word‚Äôs former editor, Andy Coulson, would face a retrial on the outstanding charges. On 17 April 2015, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that Goodman‚Äôs retrial was to be scrapped, along with that of Coulson and the trials of seven other journalists. On 18 April 2015 Goodman was found formally not guilty of all charges at the Central Criminal Court.The Sun newspaper 19 April 2015 ==See also== *Amdocs (telephony) billing log data *Israeli software role in espionage and counter espionage *Metropolitan Police role in the news media phone hacking scandal *News International phone hacking scandal *News media phone hacking scandal reference lists *R v Coulson, Brooks and others ==ReferencesCategory:Living people Category:1957 births Category:English criminals Category:English reporters and correspondents Category:People associated with the News International phone hacking scandal Category:News Corporation people ","title":"Clive Goodman"},{"id":"9130579","text":"Pervert! is a 2005 comedy horror film directed by Jonathan Yudis. It is mainly a tribute to the films of Russ Meyer. ==Plot== College student James (Andrews) arrives from New Orleans at a desert ranch owned by his father, Hezekiah (Sandeen) to help out. Soon after arriving, James is hit on by Hezekiah's wife, Cheryl (Carey), and starts having nightmares. James and Cheryl are caught by Hezekiah having sex, Cheryl and Hezekiah have a fight, then she leaves the ranch that night. Hezekiah drives into town and picks up another woman, Alisha (Sally Jean), who also quickly falls for James then disappears. Cheryl staggers into Hezekiah's \\"studio\\" (an art workshop where he makes female body sculptures out of meat), and dies in front of James. He takes her into the house, where he finds his father crying over Alisha's dead body. James calls a care facility because he thinks his dad has gone crazy. They send out a nurse, Patty (Clarke), who handcuffs Hezekiah to his bed so that the next time somebody is killed, he can be eliminated as a suspect. In the few days of waiting for the next victim to show up, Patty and James decide to while away the time by having sex. James reveals to Patty that he went to a witch doctor (Johnson) back in New Orleans to help him with attracting females but was misled; his penis can now detach itself from his body and kill people. A side story involves a sexually confused local mechanic (Yudis, the film's producer and director) and his probably intentional delay in fixing James's car, in order to seduce him. ==Cast== *Sean Andrews ....

Devoted to understanding vernacular culture, he gathered and commented upon the speech, stories, songs, emblems, rituals, art, artifacts, memorials, and landmarks which constitute laborlore. He is credited with winning Congressional support for passage of the American Folklife Preservation Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-201), which established the American Folklife Center in the Library of Congress.citation from the American Folklore Society, Botkin Prize, 1995. ==Early life and work== Born Aaron Green in Winnipeg, Manitoba he moved with his parents to Los Angeles, California in 1922. He grew up in southern California, began college at UCLA, and transferred to the University of California at Berkeley, from which he received a bachelor's degree in political science in 1939. He joined the Civilian Conservation Corps and spent his year of service in a camp on the Klamath River as a road builder and firefighter. He then worked in the San Francisco shipyards and served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. He was a member of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America for over sixty-seven years and was a Journeyman Shipwright. His pro-labor orientation owed much to his upbringing. His parents were Jewish-Ukrainian immigrants from Chernigov, where his father had participated in the uprising against the Russian czar in 1905. When that revolution failed, they escaped to Canada. In the U.S., Green's father, a socialist, supported Eugene Debs, the campaign of Upton Sinclair for governor of California in 1934, and became a supporter of President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. While living in Los Angeles, Green regularly heard political speeches in Pershing Square. Describing himself as an \\"anarcho-syndicalist with strong libertarian leanings,\\" or a \\"left- libertarian,\\"Robert Cantwell, \\"Introduction\\" to Green, Torching the Fink Books: xv. Green combined a sensitivity for working people, an abiding concern for democratic processes, and a pragmatic willingness to lobby for reforms. He spent his career not only collecting material from laborers, but encouraging workers themselves to document and preserve their own lore. In 1942 Green purchased the album Work Songs of the U.S.A. performed by folk singer Huddie \\"Leadbelly\\" Ledbetter. His love of music and especially the song \\"Old Man\\" sparked his interest in folkloristics, but it was to be nearly two decades before he returned to formal academia. ==Academic career== Green enrolled in graduate school in 1958, earning an M.L.S. degree from the University of Illinois in 1960 and a Ph.D. in folklore from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. He combined his support for labor and love of country music in the research that became his first book, Only a Miner. In the same period he recorded \\"Girl of Constant Sorrow,\\" an LP of songs sung by Sarah Ogan Gunning, the sister of coalminer, songwriter, and labor leader Jim Garland. Green joined the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1960, where he held a joint appointment in the Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations and the English Department until 1972. Working as a senior staff associate at the AFL- CIO Labor Studies Center in the early 1970s, he initiated programs presenting workers' traditions at the Smithsonian Institution's Festival of American Folklife on the National Mall, and from 1969 to 1976 he left academia to live in Washington, D.C., where he led the successful legislative campaign to enact the American Folklife Preservation Act.Benjamin Feline, Romancing the Folk: Public Memory & American Roots Music (The University of North Carolina Press, 2000), pp. 179-180. He became known for his work on occupational folklore and on early hillbilly music recordings. In 1975 he joined the faculty of the University of Texas at Austin. He was awarded the Bingham Humanities Professorship at the University of Louisville in 1977, and was a Woodrow Wilson Center fellow in Washington, DC, in 1978. His articles have appeared in Appalachian Journal, Journal of American Folklore, Labor's Heritage, Musical Quarterly, and other periodicals and anthologies. He retired from the University of Texas at Austin in June 1982, and established an archive for his collected materials in the Southern Folklife Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ==Later work== In retirement from teaching, Green continued to write and publish the results of years of research. He completed books on the tinsmiths' art, using examples from northern California (Tin Men, 2002); a monograph on millwrights in northern California over the 20th century (2003); and a collection of essays on the Sailor's Union of the Pacific (2006). Also notable was the 2007 publication of The Big Red Songbook, featuring the lyrics to the 190 songs included in the various editions of the Industrial Workers of the World's Little Red Songbooks from 1909 to 1973. Green inherited the project from John Neuhaus, a machinist and Wobbly a (member of the Industrial Workers of the World) who devoted years to collecting a nearly complete set of the IWW songbooks and determining what music the songs had been set to. When Neuhaus died of cancer in 1958, he gave his unique collection of songbooks, sheet music and other materials to Green, who vowed to carry on Neuhaus's vision of a complete edition of IWW songs. Green deposited Neuhaus's original materials in the folklife archive at the University of North Carolina.Jesse Hamlin, \\"Historian completes a labor of love -- The Big Red Songbook,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, June 18, 2007, B1, B3. At home in San Francisco, Green served as secretary of the nonprofit Fund for Labor Culture & History. Founded in July 2000, the Fund has worked with the National Trust for Historic Preservation to identify labor landmarks in San Francisco and install commemorative plaques, supported the publication of books on roots music, labor songs and historic labor landmarks, prepared guides to films on skilled union craftsmen, and helped the United Mine Workers restore the Ludlow Monument in Colorado.Fund for Labor Culture and History, Activities List, July 2000 - December 2006, 14 pp. A visit to Archie Green's home often began with his salutation, \\"Greetings, fellow worker.\\" He would always assist any researcher or student, but he would likewise always find something for them do go out and do. Green also brought together unionists, activists, scholars, and artists in \\"Laborlore Conversations,\\" a series of conferences on working class culture. Green was unable to attend the fourth of these conferences in August 2007, where he was honored with the Living Legend Award from the Librarian of Congress. archiegreen.jpg San Francisco, California In 2011, University of Illinois Press published Sean Burns' biography of Archie Green entitled Archie Green: The Making of a Working Class Hero.http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/55xxs3ep9780252078286.html The biography, which argues that the trajectory and accomplishments of Green's life can importantly challenge and expand Communist Party centered histories of the Popular Front, received the CLR James Book Award for 2012 awarded by the Working Class Studies Association. ==Honors== * In 1995 he received the Benjamin A.

He entered Parliament by winning one of the two seats for Merthyr Tydfil at a by-election on 25 November 1915 caused by the death of Labour Party founder, Keir Hardie. After the two-member Merthyr Tydfil seat was divided into two single member seats, Stanton focused on the Aberdare division, which he won at the 1918 general election, but lost at the 1922 general election. == Political career Miner's Agent and District Councillor, Aberdare=== Stanton began his political career as a miners' agent at Aberdare where he was a prominent member of the Independent Labour Party. In 1904 he was elected to the Aberdare Urban District Council as a member for the Aberaman Ward. A militant, he was critical of the more moderate approach adopted by the local Labour MP, Keir Hardie. ===The general election of December 1910 ‚Äì East Glamorganshire=== At the general election of December 1910, Stanton unsuccessfully fought the East Glamorganshire seat as a Labour candidate. For 25 years, since its creation in 1886, East Glamorganshire had been represented by the Liberal Alfred Thomas, a prominent Baptist and former Mayor of Cardiff, who stood as candidate of 'The Liberal and Labour Association' in the constituency. For the 1910 general election, the East Glamorganshire Liberal and Labour Association selected Clement Edwards. Edwards had solid Lib-Lab credentials - a barrister who had represented trade unions in major cases, he was also personally active in organising trade unions and industrial action. But Edwards was not a socialist, and he was opposed to a separate Labour Party.Duncan Tanner, (Allen) Clement Edwards in Dictionary of National Biography online, OUP 2004‚Äì10. In February 1910, Stanton comfortably won a poll organised by the South Wales Miners' Federation to select a candidate for East Glamorganshire should Alfred Thomas retire (C. B. Stanton 6,297; Alfred Onions 3,214; Thomas Andrews 3,156; T. I. Mardy Jones 2,257).The Aberdare Leader, 12 February 1910, p 7; Weekly Mail, 12 February 1910, p. 11. In May 1910, Stanton was selected as the Labour candidate for the seat by a trade union delegates meetingEvening Express, 23 May 1910, p. 3. and by July 1910 he was described as the 'accepted Labour candidate for East Glamorgan'.Evening Express, 5 July 1910, p. 3. However, Stanton was not universally popular among the leadership of the South Wales Miners Federation and the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, in part because of his militant position on industrial disputes. In November 1910, the Executive Committee of the M.F.G.B. at first refused to put Stanton's name on the Federation Parliamentary List for East Glamorgan, a decision which was reversed the following day.The Aberdare Leader, 26 November 1910, p. 5. At the general election on December 1910, Clement Edwards comfortably won the seat, the Conservative candidate took second place, while Stanton finished third : Edwards (Lib-Lab) 9,088; Gaskell (Con) 5,603; Stanton (Lab) 4,675. In his speech at the declaration, Stanton said that \\"Although defeated, he was by no means downhearted, as he realised that he was preaching a new gospel for which the electors were evidently not prepared, but the day would come when his views would be much more acceptable.The Aberdare Leader, 17 December 1910, p. 8; The Cardiff Times, 17 December 1910, p. 8. ===The Merthyr by-election of November 1915=== When the United Kingdom entered the First World War, Stanton became a strong supporter of the national war effort, and publicly opposed Keir Hardie's stance opposed to the war. Hardie's death, on 2 September 1915, a year after the outbreak of the war, caused a vacancy in one of the two Merthyr Tydfil parliamentary seats. The by-election to fill the vacancy was called for 25 November 1915. The official Labour choice to succeed Keir Hardie was James Winstone. Winstone was a leader of the miners' union - a miner's agent since 1906, he had served as Vice-President of the South Wales Miners Federation since 1912, and had recently been elected President of the South Wales Federation. He had also been a County Councillor in neighbouring Monmouthshire since 1906, and was a former chairman of the Urban District Councils of both Risca and Abersychan. In the four by-elections held in Wales since the outbreak of war, the candidate of the former member's party had been returned unopposed, in accordance with an electoral truce agreed between the parties. It was assumed therefore that the Labour Party candidate to succeed Keir Hardie would also be returned unopposed. Arthur Henderson, the Secretary of the Labour Party, wrote to the Western Mail on 17 November stating that Winstone's candidature was supported and approved by the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, the South Wales Miners' Federation, the National Executive of the Labour Party and the Merthyr constituency conference \\"representative practically of every organisation in the constituency\\", and \\"Accordingly, other parties have intimated their intention of observing the obligations of the party truce.\\" Stanton announced that he would stand against Winstone on a patriotic, win-the-war platform. Stanton's campaign focused its attack on the Independent Labour Party. Stanton presented himself as a 'National' candidate - \\"... standing on a National platform, and respecting, as I am, the political truce, I am considering not only the opinion of Labour men but of all sections of the community. And hence I do not hesitate to say that my candidature is national in the truest sense of the term. Surely, it is obvious that the success of Mr. Winstone, which is unthinkable, would be a message of discouragement to our soldiers in the field ...\\" In fact, unlike Hardie, Winstone was not a pacifist : he was a supporter of the war effort. One of his sons was already serving in France and another had just volunteered. Winstone himself addressed recruiting meetings. However, Winstone did not support conscription. Officially the national Liberal and Conservative parties were not involved in the by-election. But their members actively supported the Stanton campaign on the ground. On 23 November, the Western Mail carried a letter to Stanton's election agent from T. Artemus Jones, who had been adopted as the prospective Liberal candidate before the outbreak of war, stating that there \\"was no foundation [for] the rumour ... that the 'official' candidate [i.e. Winstone] must receive the support of all the great parties ... Such a contest as is being waged in Merthyr is outside the terms of the party truce because it is essentially a domestic difference among the members of one party and neither of the other parties in the State has any sort of right to interfere either with the one section or the other.\\" Jones added that members of the Liberal and Conservative parties were free to support Stanton : \\"There is only one issue, one duty before the people. So long as the war lasts and the party truce continues, there are neither Tories nor Radicals nor Socialists in the party sense. That issue is the war and that duty is the vigorous prosecution of the war. ... neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives are concerned in their political organisations with the dispute between Mr. Stanton and the Independent Labour Party. In their capacity as citizens, however, they have the right to form their own judgement at this supreme hour in the fortunes of the country with regard to the support they must give the government.\\" Stanton was also endorsed by the Socialist National Defence Committee.A nationalist grouping which split from the British Socialist Party in April 1915. A precursor of the British Workers National League (1916) (later shortened to the British Workers League). Some of its members subsequently became part of the pro-coalition National Democratic and Labour Party, which fought the 1918 general election against the Labour with the support of the Lloyd George \\"coupon\\". Stanton's election address described him as a \\"National\\" candidate.University of Bristol Library Special Collections, Bye-Elections Volume 1911, 1913-1919, Ref DM668/2/1, p20 : Merthyr Tydfil, 25 November 1915; online at , retrieved 2 May 2017. Since Stanton's own election campaign directly attacked the Independent Labour Party, referring to him as an \\"Independent Labour Party\\" candidate causes some unnecessary confusion. Stanton won the vacant seat with a majority of over 4,000 votes in a low poll. (Stanton: 10,286 votes; Winstone: 6,080 votes). A few weeks after Stanton's election, on 6 January 1916, the government introduced its first conscription bill. Stanton's by-election victory in Keir Hardie's old seat has been seen as facilitating the introduction of conscription.See for example: The Conscription Controversy in Great Britain, 1900‚Äì18, by R. J. Q. Adams, Philip P. Poirier (1987), at p. 132; Margot Asquith's Great War Diary 1914-1916: The View from Downing Street, edited by Michael Brock, Eleanor Brock (Oxford, OUP, 2016), Introduction to Part VII. Stanton supported the Lloyd George Coalition Government throughout the war. ===The 'Coupon' general election of December 1918=== Under the Representation of the People Act 1918 the existing parliamentary borough of Merthyr Tydfil (with its two parliamentary seats) was divided into two single-member constituencies. One of these was Merthyr Tydfil, Aberdare Division, which consisted of the two urban districts of Aberdare and Mountain Ash. Stanton fought the \\"Coupon\\" general election of December 1918 for the Aberdare Division, as a National Democratic and Labour Party candidate, with the support of the Coalition National Government \\"coupon\\". He comfortably defeated the Labour candidate, Thomas Evan Nicholas (Niclas y Glais). (Stanton: 22,824 votes; Nicholas: 6,229 votes) Stanton and Nicholas had taken opposite positions during the War - Nicholas, like Hardie, was a pacifist, and had opposed both the War and conscription. They were also opposed in their policies for the peace, Stanton supporting the policy of imposing heavy reparations obligations on the defeated nations : his manifesto demanded that \\"the filthy, murderous Huns\\" be made to pay for the war. Stanton also called for the expulsion of \\"all aliens\\". (In the Merthyr Division, at the 1918 general election, Sir Edgar Rees Jones, standing as a Coalition Liberal, defeated James Winstone, standing again as a Labour candidate, by 1,445 votes. Sir Edgar Rees Jones had first been elected to Parliament at the January 1910 general election as one of the two MPs for Merthyr Tydfil). ===The general election of November 1922=== Stanton again fought the Aberdare division at the general election of November 1922, this time as a Lloyd George National Liberal candidate. He was defeated by the Labour candidate, George Hall (Hall: 20,704 votes; Stanton: 15,487 votes). Hall went on to hold the Aberdare seat for the Labour Party for the next twenty years, and the Labour Party continued to hold the Aberdare seat until the constituency was abolished in 1983. In 1928 Stanton joined the Liberal Party. Stanton's failure at the 1922 general election was shared by the nine other MPs seeking to hold seats they had won in the \\"coupon\\" election of 1918 under the National Democratic and Labour Party banner. Among the nine was Clement Edwards, who had defeated Stanton in East Glamorganshire in 1910 : Edwards won East Ham South as the NDLP candidate in 1918 ; he defended that seat as a National Liberal supporter of Lloyd George in 1922, but was defeated by the Labour candidate. (In 1922, R. C. Wallhead won the single-seat Merthyr division for Labour. Like Keir Hardie and Thomas Evan Nicholas (Niclas y Glais), Wallhead had been a committed opponent of World War I. Wallhead held the Merthyr Division until his death in 1934, when S. O. Davies won the seat for Labour. Davies held the seat for Labour until the general election of 1970, when he was deselected by the Labour Party, but won the seat as an Independent Socialist. Upon Davies' death in 1972, Ted Rowlands regained the seat for Labour.) ==References== == External links == * 'STANTON , CHARLES BUTT (1873-1946), M.P. for the Merthyr and Aberdare constituency, 1915-1922' by Professor Huw Morris-Jones (2001), Dictionary of Welsh Biography (Welsh Biography Online), National Library of Wales; retrieved 26 August 2017. * 'Charles Butt Stanton MP (1873-1946)', on the U.K. Parliament website; retrieved 26 August 2017. * 'Charles Butt Stanton 1873-1946' by Ivor T Rees, The National Library of Wales Journal, Vol XXXV No 3 (2010), retrieved 2 May 2017. * 'The Merthyr Boroughs Election, November 1915', by Anthony M√¥r-O'Brien, Welsh History Review, Vol. 12, no. 4 (1985), pp. 538‚Äì566, online at Welsh Journals Online (National Library of Wales) (retrieved 26 August 2017). * 'Remembering 1910', 'A new history of Wales' by Dr Louise Miskill, WalesOnline (5 October 2010; updated 28 March 2013; retrieved 2 August 2017) (includes an account of Stanton's radical leadership in the 1910 Powell Duffryn coal strike). * Category:1873 births Category:1946 deaths Category:UK MPs 1910‚Äì1918 Category:UK MPs 1918‚Äì1922 Category:National Democratic and Labour Party MPs Category:People from Aberdare Category:Liberal Party (UK) politicians Category:National Liberal Party (UK, 1922) politicians ","title":"Charles Stanton"},{"id":"9130668","text":"The 1928 FA Cup Final was contested by Blackburn Rovers and Huddersfield Town at Wembley Stadium.

Phrased differently, the duality is the isomorphism between completely positive maps (channels) from A to Cn√ón, where A is a C*-algebra and Cn√ón denotes the n√ón complex entries, and positive linear functionals (states) on the tensor product :\\\\mathbb{C}^{n \\\\times n} \\\\otimes A. ==Details== Let H1 and H2 be (finite-dimensional) Hilbert spaces. The family of linear operators acting on Hi will be denoted by L(Hi). Consider two quantum systems, indexed by 1 and 2, whose states are density matrices in L(Hi) respectively. A quantum channel, in the Schr√∂dinger picture, is a completely positive (CP for short), trace-preserving linear map :\\\\Phi : L(H_1) \\\\rightarrow L(H_2) that takes a state of system 1 to a state of system 2. Next we describe the dual state corresponding to Œ¶. Let Ei j denote the matrix unit whose ij-th entry is 1 and zero elsewhere. The (operator) matrix :\\\\rho_{\\\\Phi} = (\\\\Phi(E_{ij}))_{ij} \\\\in L(H_1) \\\\otimes L(H_2) is called the Choi matrix of Œ¶. By Choi's theorem on completely positive maps, Œ¶ is CP if and only if œÅŒ¶ is positive (semidefinite). One can view œÅŒ¶ as a density matrix, and therefore the state dual to Œ¶. The duality between channels and states refers to the map :\\\\Phi \\\\rightarrow \\\\rho_{\\\\Phi}, a linear bijection. This map is also called Jamio≈Çkowski isomorphism or Choi‚ÄìJamio≈Çkowski isomorphism. == Applications == This isomorphism is used to show that the \\"Prepare and Measure\\" Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols, such as the BB84 protocol devised by C.

During his skating career he lived in Omsk, skating for Burevestnik. In 1952, Norwegian skater Hjalmar Andersen set a legendary world record on the 10,000-m, with a time of 16:32.6.

After his death in the 660s his sons divided his kingdom amongst themselves. Batbayan, the eldest son, inherited the throne in Poltava but was defeated by and submitted to the rule of his ambitious relative Cozarig (Kotrag) who had undermined the state's unity by leading his Don-Volga Khazars (Kutrigs) in expansion campaigns extending his empire to the north where Volga Bulgaria would eventually remain. The third son Asparuh marched westward and settled in the Ongal area on the eastern banks of the Danube. Eventually the Avars fought back and after Asparuh consolidated his rule they launched an attack against the Byzantine lands to the south. During that time the Byzantine Empire was at war with the Arabs who had recently besieged the capital Constantinople. However, in 680 the Byzantines defeated the Arabs and concluded a peace treaty. After this success the emperor Constantine IV was free to move against the Bulgars and led an army against Asparuh. In the meantime the Bulgar leader made an alliance with the Seven Slavic tribes for mutual protection against the Byzantines and formed a federation. ==The battle== According to the Chronicles of Nikephoros I of Constantinople: The Bulgars had built wooden ramparts in the swampy area near the Peuce Island. The marshes forced the Byzantines to attack from a weakened position and in smaller groups, which reduced the strength of their attack. With continuing attacks from the ramparts, the Bulgar defense eventually forced the Byzantines into a rout, followed up by the Bulgar cavalry. Many of the Byzantine soldiers perished. According to popular belief, the emperor had leg pain and went to Nessebar to seek treatment. The troops thought that he fled the battlefield and in turn began fleeing. When the Bulgars realised what was happening, they attacked and defeated their discouraged enemy. Supposed plan of the battle. ==Aftermath== After the victory, the Bulgars advanced south and seized the lands to the north of Stara Planina. In 681 they invaded Thrace defeating the Byzantines again. Constantine IV found himself in a dead-lock and asked for peace. With the treaty of 681 the Byzantines recognised the creation of the new Bulgarian state and were obliged to pay annual tribute to the Bulgarian rulers, which was greatly humiliating for the empire. ==Significance== This battle was a significant moment in European history, as it led to the creation of a powerful state, which was to become a European superpower in the 9th and 10th century along with the Byzantine and Frankish Empires. It became a cultural and spiritual centre of south Slavic Europe through most of the Middle Ages. ==Honour== Ongal Peak in Tangra Mountains on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named for the historical Ongal area. ==Footnotes== ==References== *–ê—Ç–∞–Ω–∞—Å –ü–µ–π—á–µ–≤ –∏ –∫–æ–ª–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤, 1300 –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∏ –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–∂–∞, –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—Å—Ç–≤–æ, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è 1984. *–ô–æ—Ä–¥–∞–Ω –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–µ–≤, –ú–∏–ª—á–æ –õ–∞–ª–∫–æ–≤, –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ —Ö–∞–Ω–æ–≤–µ –∏ —Ü–∞—Ä–µ, –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ –¢—ä—Ä–Ω–æ–≤–æ, 1996. *–ü–ª–∞–º–µ–Ω –ü–∞–≤–ª–æ–≤, –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è—Ç–∞ - –¥–∞–ª–µ—á–Ω–∞ –∏ –±–ª–∏–∑–∫–∞, –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ –¢—ä—Ä–Ω–æ–≤–æ, 2010. ==External links== * Byzantine Battles Category:680s conflicts Category:680 Category:7th century in Bulgaria Category:Battles involving the First Bulgarian Empire Category:Battles of the Byzantine‚ÄìBulgarian Wars Category:680s in the Byzantine Empire Category:7th century in Romania Category:Military history of Romania Category:Budjak ","title":"Battle of Ongal"},{"id":"9130783","text":"Clive Williams (born 2 November 1948)Clive Williams player profiles Scrum.com is a former international rugby union player.

With the Boston Braves in 1944, he pitched two no-hitters, although one of them was five innings, which was considered a no-hitter until 1991 when the MLB officially defined a no-hitter as having to be nine innings or longer. ==Professional baseball career== Tobin was born in Oakland, California, where the hometown Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League picked him up. They sent him to their Bisbee-Douglas farm team in the Arizona‚ÄìTexas League. The New York Yankees signed him shortly thereafter. He played for them in Binghamton and Wheeling in 1933 and 1934. The Yankees sent him back to Oakland in 1935, where he compiled an 11‚Äì8 record before tearing the cartilage in his left knee. Appendicitis kept him off the Yankee roster the following year, and he went 16‚Äì8 for the Oaks. Rather than return to the Oaks in 1937, he arranged a deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates, with whom he made his major league debut on April 30, 1937. In 1940, Tobin joined the Boston Braves. On May 13, 1942, he became the only pitcher in modern major-league history to hit three home runs in one game (Guy Hecker hit three homers in a game in the 19th century). He finished the 1942 season with 12 wins and a league leading 21 losses and allowed a league leading 20 home runs to opposing batters. He also hit 6 home runs that year as a pitcher and pinch-hitter. Still with the Braves in 1944, Tobin began throwing a knuckleball, and that season he threw his two no- hitters. The first was April 27, 1944, when he beat the Brooklyn Dodgers 2‚Äì0. The second was a five-inning game on June 22, 1944, in which the Philadelphia Phillies fell 7‚Äì0 (officially, this game is no longer considered a true no- hitter, as it lasted fewer than nine innings). In another interesting event in 1944, Tobin drew a walk against Cincinnati Reds pitcher Clyde Shoun in the third inning of what would otherwise have been a perfect game for Shoun (who settled instead for a no-hitter). Tobin was with the Tigers in 1945, when they won the American League pennant and the World Series. He pitched in Game 1 of the series, on October 3, which was his final major league game. He was back in the Pacific Coast League the following year, pitching for the Seattle Rainiers and the San Francisco Seals. He was released in 1947, but the Oaks re-signed him in August 1948. That year he pitched the last out against the Sacramento Solons in a game that clinched the pennant for the Oaks. Tobin was the brother of Boston Red Sox third baseman Jackie Tobin. ==Career statistics== While Tobin played only one major league game at a position other than pitcher, he pinch-hit over 100 times in his major league career. The fine-hitting hurler batted .230/.303/.345 in the majors. He totaled 35 doubles, 17 homers and 102 RBI in 796 at-bats. He also drew 80 walks. Tobin went 105‚Äì112 in the majors with a 3.44 ERA. He completed 156 of 227 career starts and led the league in complete games twice in 1942 and again in 1944 with 28 games completed each season. In 1942 workhorse Tobin lead the league in innings pitched with 287. Although not leading the league, he pitched 299 innings in 1944 In the minors, Tobin won 81 games and lost 51. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball all-time leaders in home runs by pitchers * List of Major League Baseball no-hitters ==References== ==External links== *Baseball-Reference Bullpen * : Category:1912 births Category:1969 deaths Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Boston Bees players Category:Boston Braves players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Baseball players from California Category:Sportspeople from Oakland, California ","title":"Jim Tobin"},{"id":"9130844","text":"Allan Jeffery Martin (born 11 December 1948) is a former Aberavon RFC and Welsh international rugby union player.Allan Martin player profile ESPN Scrum.com He was noted for his long distance goal-kicking and specialist line- out forward. ==Biography== Having received his education at Sandfields Comprehensive school in Port Talbot Martin was capped at lock in every schoolboy age group by his country.

It is the first officially planned neighbourhood of Belgrade in 12 years; the project was started in 2006, and the apartments were used by participants of the 2009 Summer Universiade in Belgrade. The complex consists of 14 residential buildings and 2 commercial buildings, and more than 300 stores, a sales pavilion and a large parking space, covering a total area of 13.8 hectares. The construction investor is the company \\"Block 67 Associates\\". ==Name== Belville, which means \\"beautiful city\\" in French, is a common name of residential quarters in France, Canada and the United States. ==Location== Belville is located within Block 67, in New Belgrade. It is bounded by the following streets: Yuri Gagarin Street, Agostinho Neto Street, ƒêorƒëe Stanojeviƒá Street and Spanish Fighters Street. ==Residential complex== Belville covers an area of over 14 hectares and consists of 14 residential buildings and two buildings with office space containing 1,858 apartments of 27 different sizes and areas between 31 and 104 m¬≤, and 333 shops on the ground floor of residential buildings. The underground parking garage and parking place provide parking space for more than 1,300 cars. Besides, there is outdoor parking space for more than 600 cars. There are two elevators for underground garages in each building. Investor of the Belville construction is the company Block 67 Associates, whose founders are Delta Real Estate and Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank a.d.. The author of the architectural project is Milutin Gec, Eng. Arch., while the other projects were entrusted to Ma≈°inoprojekt. The project management and supervision was done by the company Mace doo, founded by the Mace Group. Construction works were performed by the companies Deneza M, Montera, GK Kocic, Eksing, Grading, Gredina, Ratko Mitrovic Dedinje and Integral Banja Luka. The project was started in August 2006, and the construction began in June 2007. The keys to apartments that accommodated the Universiade participants were given in March 2009. Keys were first given to apartment owners on December 8, 2009. Delta City shopping mall is in the vicinity of the complex. Each of the residential buildings, ranging in size from 10 to 13 floors, is named after a type of flower: Rose, Tulip, Lily, Lilac, Hyacinth, Cyclamen, Wallflower, Mayflower, Sunflower, Mimosa, Violet, Dandelion, Calendula and Iris. ==Characteristics== The \\"University Village\\" was planned for use by the participants in the 2009 Summer Universiade in Belgrade. The project was started in August 2006, construction began in June 2007, and in March 2009 the first apartments were ready to be used by participants in the 2009 Summer Universiade. The keys of the first apartments were delivered to their owners on December 8, 2009. The neighborhood has three zones: residential, international and free zone. It covers 140,000 square metres and has 2,100 condos that were used by 9,000 sportsmen. Also built within the complex are a computer center, two 10-storeys business towers, a post office, underground garages, hair and beauty salons, a trim trail, etc. The city government plans to make the University Village a fully functional residential neighborhood for 6,000 inhabitants after the Universiade, so from 2009 new school, kindergarten, retirement home, etc. are planned to be built too. The northeastern corner of the block remained undeveloped. In January-May 2020 it was adapted into the outdoor parking lot \\"Belville\\" with over 420 spaces. == Universiade 2009 == During the 25th Summer Universiade 2009, which was held in Belgrade from 1 until 12 July 2009, the Belville complex accommodated almost 9,000 athletes from 145 countries. The Universiade was officially opened in the Arena Belgrade, and sports competitions were held in Zemun, Pancevo, Obrenovac, Novi Sad, Smederevo and Vrsac. Belville was officially opened as a university village on June 24, 2009. == Romville == Part of the terrain on which the Belville was to be built, was a Romani informal settlement. They were moved on an empty lot just west of the Belville. In the next years, the settlement grew, becoming the one with the worst living conditions in the town: no electricity, no water, rats infestation, etc. Inhabitants were constantly illegally tapping on the electricity lines, from any source possible: street lights, traffic signs, neighboring railway facilities, etc., using cables without an insulation dragged through the water. Out of 366 children of the school age, even though it is mandatory by the law, only 20 of them were pupils. It was colloquially named Romville (Rom[ani]+[Bel]ville). The settlement was also partially obstructing the construction of the access roads to the newly built Ada Bridge. City tried to relocate the settlers but they refused, gaining support from some NGO‚Äôs. After a long stalemate, the city forcefully, using the police, first counted the settlers and then relocated them all, 974 persons, in one day, 26 April 2012. City employed 450 communal workers and 110 buses which relocated the inhabitants to Maki≈°, Jabuƒçki Rit, Resnik, Dren, Barajevo and Kijevo. Despite the previous skirmish between the settlers and the representatives of the city, the relocation itself was without incident, closely watched by the local inspections and the representatives of the international human rights institutions. At their destinations, some of the settlers were provided with shipping container houses with running water and electricity. Others were sent back to the town or city in Serbia where they had a registered address, without provision for adequate alternative accommodation. One group of Roma who were sent back to Ni≈° were relocated in an abandoned warehouse without access to water, sanitation or electricity. In June 2020, two Roma forced to live here were awarded more than ‚Ç¨2,600 each (plus interest) in compensation by the Belgrade Court of Appeal after they brought a court case against the Republic of Serbia, the City of Belgrade and the City of Ni≈° for discrimination. ==References== == External links == * Belville.rs, Official web site of ‚ÄúBlock 67 Associates‚Äù * Official web site of ‚ÄúDelta Real Estates‚Äù * Mace Group about Belville Category:Neighborhoods of Belgrade Category:New Belgrade ","title":"Belville, Belgrade"},{"id":"9130903","text":"St. Ambrose University is a private Roman Catholic university in Davenport, Iowa. It is affiliated with the Diocese of Davenport. ==HistoryFoundation=== St. Ambrose was founded as a seminary and school of commerce for young men in 1882, known as St. Ambrose Academy. It owes its beginning to the first bishop of Davenport, The Most Reverend John McMullen, DD, who founded it under the auspices of the Diocese of Davenport. The affiliation remains strong today. Ambrose Hall For its first three years, classes were held in two rooms of the old St. Marguerite's School, located on the grounds of what is now Sacred Heart Cathedral in Davenport. Bishop McMullen died in 1883, and Reverend \\"A.J.\\" Aloysius Schulte was named the first president of St. Ambrose at the age of 23. The school was moved to Locust Street in 1885, where the central part of the present-day Ambrose Hall was built. Located in a secluded grove of oak trees, the site was far removed from the city. That same year, St. Ambrose was incorporated as ‚Äúa literary, scientific and religious institution.‚Äù The articles of incorporation stated, ‚ÄúNo particular religious faith shall be required of any person to entitle him to admission to said seminary.‚Äù By the start of the 20th century, a clearer division was being made between the high school academy and the college program. In 1908, the name of the institution was officially changed to ‚ÄúSt. Ambrose College‚Äù to express the institution's mission. Night school classes were inaugurated in 1924, and the first session of summer school was held in 1931. During World War II, the United States Navy chose St. Ambrose College as a location for the training of many officers. For a short time, regular classes ceased, and the campus became a training ground for the Navy's V-12 squads. ===St. Ambrose Academy=== The high school program, St. Ambrose Academy, was founded at the same time as the college and housed in the college's buildings. From 1886-1931 some of the academy students were boarded on the campus. The Rev. Ambrose Burke, who would become the college's president in 1940, was named the academy's first principal in 1929. In 1955 the diocese decided that Davenport should have a central Catholic high school, and that St. Ambrose and Immaculate Conception academies should be merged. They moved to their new quarters at Assumption High School in 1958. This move provided additional space on campus for continued growth of the college. ===Growth=== In 1968, St. Ambrose became fully coeducational, although women had been taking classes on campus ever since the 1930s. St. Ambrose began offering graduate classes in 1977 with the H.L. McLaughlin Master of Business Administration program. Its graduate offerings have since expanded to 14 programs.

He won thirteen caps as left wing for Wales between 1973 and 1983. Clive Rees's rugby career started at Llanelli Grammar School in the late 1960s where he instantly became known as 'Fred' and played on the wing at all levels. In the same Llanelli & District Schoolboys team were future internationals Gareth Jenkins and Stephen Warlow, and Scarlets Bernard Thomas and Roy Mathias. He displayed his natural speed by winning both the 100 and 200 meters at the Colwyn Bay Secondary Schools Athletic Championship. Rees went on to study at Loughborough College, where he played in the rugby team for three seasons alongside future stars Fran Cotton and Steve Smith. During a freshers trial Rees came off the wing to score under the post which prompted coach Jim Greenwood to invite him to join the senior squad. Rees played opposite Lewis Dick (who went on to play for Scotland). At only eighteen he found himself in the College Sevens team, beating Cardiff in the final of the Glengarth Sevens. It was here that a boy said to Steve Smith that Clive Rees was running so fast his legs were a blur, just like Billy Whizz from The Beano - a nickname by which Rees is still fondly referred to. During a holiday from Loughborough, Rees returned home to play for Llanelli RFC. ‚ÄúHe was selected for a ‚ÄòWelsh Trial‚Äô in which he overtook J.J. Williams to make a try saving tackle, which made the selectors sit up and take note‚Äù. He won his first cap for Wales in 1973, the year he started playing for Llanelli Wanderers prior to moving to London Welsh, and played in the Welsh side that beat Australia in 1975. He was reselected to the Welsh squad in 1980. ‚Äú‚ÄòBilly Whizz‚Äô was not only playing better than at any time in his career, but that his re-selection was long overdue. The London Welsh wing was never dropped again and although he never scored a try for Wales himself, his brilliant running and unselfish support ensured that many others profited handsomely. His legendary carving run down the left wing at Murrayfield produced one of the great Welsh tries of the decade in 1983.‚Äù In 1983 Rees scored his 100th try for London Welsh against London Scottish, drawing a standing ovation. Rees was made captain of London Welsh for the club's 1984-85 centenary season. He was determined to make a break with the past, ignore nostalgic media comparisons to the great John Dawes era, and shake the club into a determined drive for excellence. Under his enthusiastic captaincy the club was unbeaten at home for a record-breaking seven months, and for the first time in its history London Welsh reached the final of the John Player Cup. Rees himself is on record as having scored most tries in the Cup with eleven after J.P.R. Williams' six. To cap the centenary season London Welsh went on a world tour. Together with the likes of Kevin Bowring and Robert Ackerman, Clive Rees was in the London Welsh team that won the Middlesex Sevens. During his career Rees also played nine times for the Barbarians and journalists voted him player of the tournament in the Hong Kong Sevens. In 1974, he was selected as the youngest member of the British Lions squad for the tour of South Africa. The Lions were unbeaten on that tour, with 21 wins and one draw. Rees had to stop playing after 7 gamesClive Rees Lions profile lionsrugby.com because he broke his hand. In 1987 Rees travelled to Japan to train the Toshiba team. All the while Clive Rees was a highly respected school teacher. After starting his teaching career at Highdown School, he was head of rugby at Chiltern Edge School, then went on to become head of PE at Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School in London and later at Clifton College Prep School in Bristol. ==Notes== Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Welsh rugby union players Category:Wales international rugby union players Category:British and Irish Lions rugby union players from Wales Category:London Welsh RFC players Category:Llanelli RFC players Category:Barbarian F.C. players Category:Welsh people of Singaporean descent Category:Loughborough Students RUFC players Category:People educated at Llanelli Boys' Grammar School ","title":"Clive Rees"},{"id":"9130929","text":"Bolshoy Ustinsky Bridge () is a steel arch bridge that spans Moskva River near the mouth of Yauza River, connecting the Boulevard Ring with Zamoskvorechye district in Moscow, Russia.

Large structure in upper left quarter is Foundling House (The Orphanage, 1763-1770) View of 1881 Ustinsky Bridge, Orphanage, and Kremlin. Postcard from a photograph made before 1887, when the First electrical powerplant (MoGes One) was built The first Ustinsky Bridge across Moskva River was built in 1881, to a very common triple-span arch design by V.N.Speyer.Bridges of Moscow, p.84 Three spans were 39.5, 44.5 and 39.5 meters long and 19.2 meters wide (4 lanes, including two tram tracks); each span was suspended by 12 riveted arches. All downtown bridges built in 1880-1911 over Moskva River followed this triple-span shape; none survived in their original shape (Borodinsky and Novospassky still stand on original pylons, but arches were replaced with plate girders). As the archive photo shows, bridge and embankment traffic cross each other in the same level. This was probably the most important reason for replacing the bridge in the 1930s (others being insufficient width and shipping clearance). Lower Yauza river had numerous bridges, dams and water mills since Middle Ages. The 1853 city plan shows a total of four such crossings. One was eventually demolished without replacement, three others correspond (west to east) to present-day Maly Ustinsky, Astakhovsky (Yauzsky) and Tessinsky bridges. Most important of these, Yauzsky Bridge, connecting city center with eastbound roads, was rebuilt in stone in 1804. In 1812, it was in the path of retreating Russian Army when it evacuated Moscow after Battle of Borodino.Tarle, Ye., Napoleon's Invasion of Russia, 1812 (New York, Oxford University Press, 1942, 1971; originally published in Russian in 1938) Yauzsky Bridge was renamed Astakhovsky after I.T.Astakhov, a steelworkers' leader killed on the bridge during a rally on February 28, 1917; this title remains official to date.Russian: Decision of Moscow City Council Presidium, N31, May 13, 1993, On restitution of historical titles to city elements within the protected zone of Garden Ring, Architectural commission of Moscow Before World War II, city planners intended to complete the Boulevard Ring with a link through Zamoskvorechye. This called for a bridge with higher traffic capacity, so a replacement Bolshoy Ustinsky bridge was built. Maly Ustinsky and Yauzsky (Astakhovsky) Bridge were also torn down and rebuilt to the same high capacity standard. Ring link was never completed; its planned outline can be vaguely traced by a chain of grand stalinist buildings near Tretyakovskaya metro station. Traffic through Bolshoy Ustinsky Bridge remains relatively low (unlike the busy Yauza bridges). ==Bolshoy Ustinsky Bridge (1938)== Bolshoy and Maly Ustinsky Bridges The bridge is 40 meters wide and 478 meters long; main span is 134 meters long, having six parallel steel arches (span formula 50.5+134.0+50.5 meters). Orthotropic deck is supported by I-beams; there are six road lanes and two tram tracks on a raised divider. Two features make this bridge unique: *There are no massive stone pillars: arches are set onto low pylons that do not protrude above street level. Each pylon rests on a flat slab measuring 31.2 by 40.0 meters. *It is the only major downtown bridge that retains tram traffic (routes A, 3, 39 ‚Äì the last and only tram line inside Garden Ring). Bolshoy Ustinsky bridge was reconstructed in 1999-2000, replacing the roadway deck with an improved, lighter orthotropic type. It retained all original structural details. ==Komissariatsky Bridge (1927)== Looking north into Komissariatsky alley, exactly on the old site of Komissariatsky Bridge. Present-day bridge with the same name is 300 meters north-west (left) Maly Ustinsky Bridge The first, wooden Komissariatsky Bridge (–ö–æ–º–∏—Å—Å–∞—Ä–∏–∞—Ç—Å–∫–∏–π –º–æ—Å—Ç) across Vodootvodny Canal existed since the 1850s, in line with Komissariatsky Lane. It was named after the nearby New Kriegskomissariat, a castle-like military depot (built 1778-1781); there is no relation to Red Commissars of 20th century. Existing Komissariatsky Bridge continues the Bolshoy Ustinsky Bridge path across Vodootvodny Canal into Zamoskvorechye, 300 meters north-west from the old site. It was built in 1927 by Boris Tyazhelov (span 46 meters, width 19.4 meters, shallow concrete arch type). However, it was put to regular use (including trams) only in 1960.Bridges of Moscow, p.88 ==Maly Ustinsky Bridge (1938)== Spans right over the mouth of Yauza, continuing Moskvoretskaya Embankment into westward Kotelnicheskaya Embankment.

He is also a playwright, director, performer, and cofounder of the Transversal Theater Company, an Amsterdam-based collective of American and European artists, which has produced a number of his works. Reynolds received his bachelor's degree in English Literature at the University of California, Berkeley, and his master's and doctoral degrees in English and American Literature and Language at Harvard University. He has been a Professor of Drama at the University of California, Irvine since 1998. He has held visiting professorships at the University of London-Drama, the University of Amsterdam-Theater Studies, Utrecht University-Theater Studies, University of Cologne-American Studies, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main-American Studies, University College Utrecht-Arts and Humanities, the University of California, San Diego-Theatre, Literature, Cognitive Science, the American University of Beirut-English, University of Tsukuba-Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Nairobi-Department of Literature, Alpen-Adria-Universit√§t Klagenfurt-Communications, University of Lorraine-Arts, Sciences, & Business Management, INSEEC Business School (L'Institut des hautes √©tudes √©conomiques et commerciales)-Marketing, Paris, Bordeaux, Lyon; and he has taught at Deleuze Camp at Schloss Wahn, University of Cologne, Germany, and the Grotowski Institute in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland, among other academic and performing arts institutions. Reynolds is also a regular contributor to Freeskier Magazine, where he publishes articles derived from his ongoing research on extreme sports. ==Early life== Born in New York City to Donna Reynolds, a VP of marketing at General Foods, and Donald Reynolds, a VC, Reynolds‚Äô family moved from the Upper East Side to the Westchester County suburb of Scarsdale when he was a toddler. He attended Heathcote Elementary School, where he played soccer for the famed Heathcote Hornets through 8th grade, which was coached by New York Cosmos first general manager Clive Toye. He was also an avid skate boarder, BMXer, and skier, which informs his research on action sports. Not an enthusiastic student, Reynolds was encouraged to leave Scarsdale High School for the more disciplinary Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains. As one of two Jewish students attending the Roman Catholic school at the time, Reynolds decided to return to Scarsdale for his junior and senior years, where he joined a special program, called CORE, for students who had difficulties making it to class. Reynolds graduated in 1983 with a D average. His pursuit of a career racing motorcycle motocross brought him out to San Diego in 1985, where he attended Grossmont Community College. From there, he went to UC Berkeley, and then Harvard University for his doctorate. ==Critical works== *\\"The Devil's House, 'or worse': Transversal Power and Antitheatrical Discourse in Early Modern England\\" (1997) \\"The Devil's House, 'or worse'\\" is the first published text for Reynolds' transversal theory. In this article, transversal theory is delineated through an analysis of early modern English theater, both on the public stage and as in social performances in society at large. The article argues for the power of theater to simultaneously alter subjectivity and social identity as well as the political, economic, and social conditions under which they operate. Using spatial and temporal models for both abstract and material relations within and between individuals and groups, as well as in relation to things, transversal theory explains changes in human cognition, perspective, and experience, particularly those that move subjectivity away from habit, singularity, and stasis. *Becoming Criminal: Transversal Performance and Cultural Dissidence in Early Modern England (2002) Becoming Criminal shows how the dissident activities and idiosyncratic languages of gypsies, rogues, vagabonds, and cutpurses interacted with normative society and culture. Reynolds argues that the real and imaginary \\"criminal culture\\" on the streets and in popular minds has been overlooked or misunderstood by scholars. He traces the effect of criminal culture to its emergence in the 16th century, when this community related daily with dominant aspects of English ideology and culture and modeled its own cultural characteristics in response to the conventions of the time. According to Reynolds, their behavior and thought is most evident in the period's commercial literature, such as in pamphlet literature and the works of Shakespeare, Jonson, Fletcher, and Brome, and in its material and symbolic relationships to the public theatre. *Performing Transversally: Reimagining Shakespeare and the Critical Future (2003) Reynolds' transversal poetics project, expanded from his early works, is used in Performing Transversally to discuss historical and contemporary examples. He discusses the applicability of the critical concept, ranging from the sociology of Erving Goffman to the feminism and psychoanalytics of Julia Kristeva to the dramatic and theatrical criticism of Antonin Artaud and Herbert Blau. Performing Transversally navigates the ever-increasing cultural cartography of Shakespace, a term invented by Reynolds and Donald Hedrick in Shakespeare Without Class: Misappropriations of Cultural Capital, to designate past, present, and future Shakespeare influenced spaces of text, performance, and culture. Throughout the book, Reynolds emphasizes the importance of accountability, whether in the classroom, in academic research, on the stage or screen, or in everyday lives. *Transversal Enterprises in the Drama of Shakespeare and his Contemporaries: Fugitive Explorations (2006) In Transversal Enterprises, with a number of collaborators, Reynolds analyzes plays by early modern English dramatists in the context of shifts in English history. He relates transversal poetics to other academic disciplines, including science and theology, to explore a transformation in views on space and place in relation to subjectivity and consciousness. Witches, werewolves, occultists, academicians, transvestites, baboons, moors, and gypsies, among other creatures, all reflect, for Reynolds, a metamorphic and intersubjective phenomenology for which art or artifice is requisite. *Transversal Subjects: From Montaigne to Deleuze after Derrida (2009) Transversal Subjects traces the genealogy of Transversal Poetics from discourses on human rights, compassion, and psychopathology in the work of Montaigne and Rousseau through Husserl, Arendt, Baudrillard, Agamben, Habermas, Ranci√®re, and others. In so doing, Reynolds makes the case that subjectivity is an emergent, shifting, and mobile phenomenon that is transversal to the subject. This allows access to affecters and enablers of transversal processes that work to empower individuals and groups in their comprehension and experience of themselves, others, and the world. *Intermedial Theater: Performance Philosophy, Transversal Poetics, and the Future of Affect (2017). In this book, Reynolds and his collaborators explore relationships between intermedial theater, consciousness, memory, objects, subjectivity, and affect through productive engagement with the performance aesthetics, socio-cognitive theory, and critical methodology of transversal poetics alongside other leading philosophical approaches to performance. Intermedial Theater offers the first sustained analysis of the work of Gilles Deleuze, F√©lix Guattari, Jean Baudrillard, and Friedrich Nietzsche in relation to the contemporary European theater of Jan Lauwers and Needcompany, Romeo Castellucci and Soc√¨etas Raffaello Sanzio, Thomas Ostermeier, Rodrigo Garc√≠a and La Carnicer√≠a Teatro, and the Transversal Theater Company. It connects contemporary uses of objects, simulacra, and technologies in both posthumanist discourse and postdramatic theater to the transhistorically and culturally mediating power of Shakespeare as a means by which to discuss the affective impact of intermedial theater on today‚Äôs audiences. ==Honours== *2020: Tor Vergata Award, Railroad (director/playwright), 28th Annual Festival Internazionale del Teatro Patologico, Rome, Italy. *2016: Awarded endowed chair, \\"Claire Trevor Professor,\\" University of California, Irvine. *2014: Research Award, International Centre for Muslim and non-Muslim Understanding (MnM), University of South Australia. *2014: Invitation Fellowship Award, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. *2014: Distinguished Visiting Scholar, American University of Beirut, Lebanon. *2012: Awarded title of \\"Chancellor's Professor\\" by the University of California. *2008: Silver Award: Experimental Web Site, 5th Annual Pcom Creative Awards (Creative Director, Bryan Reynolds; Designer/Illustrator/Animator/Programmer, Alex Sacui). *2006: Honored as a Distinguished Alumnus of Scarsdale High School, New York. *2005: Awarded title of \\"Chancellor's Fellow\\" by the University of California. *2004: Honored by the University of Alabama's Hudson Strode Program in Renaissance Studies, directed by Gary Taylor, as \\"one of the six most brilliant Renaissance scholars in the world under 40,\\" \\"for work on 'transversal poetics.'\\" *2001-2002: Distinguished Early-Career Faculty Award for Teaching, University of California, Irvine. ==PublicationsBooks written=== *Intermedial Theater: Performance Philosophy, Transversal Poetics, and the Future of Affect (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2017). *Transversal Subjects: From Montaigne to Deleuze after Derrida (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2009). *Transversal Enterprises in the Drama of Shakespeare and his Contemporaries: Fugitive Explorations (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006). *Performing Transversally: Reimagining Shakespeare and the Critical Future (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003). *Becoming Criminal: Transversal Performance and Cultural Dissidence in Early Modern England (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002). ===Books edited=== *Performance Studies: Key Words, Concepts and Theories, Editor (Houndmills, Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014). *The Return of Theory in Early Modern English Studies, Volume II, Co-Editor, with Paul Cefalu and Gary Kuchar (Houndmills, Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014). *The Return of Theory in Early Modern English Studies: Tarrying with the Subjunctive, Co-Editor, with Paul Cefalu (Houndmills, Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011). *Critical Responses to Kiran Desai, Co-Editor, with Sunita Sinha (New Delhi, India: Atlantic Publishers 2009). *Rematerializing Shakespeare: Authority and Representation on the Early Modern English Stage, Co-Editor, with William West (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005). *Shakespeare Without Class: Misappropriations of Cultural Capital, Co-Editor, with Donald Hedrick (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2000). ===Plays=== *Unbuckled (play), Written by Bryan Reynolds, The Anthology of Contemporary Plays 2004 (Sibiu, Romania: Annual Publication of the Sibiu International Theatre Festival, 2004). **Productions: Directors Bryan Reynolds & Jef Vowell, The Flight Theatre, Hollywood, California, July 2004; Andrei Muresanu Theatre, Sf√¢ntu- Gheorghe, Romania, June 2004; Ariel Theatre, T√¢rgu Mure≈ü, Romania, June 2004; The National Theatre, Cluj, Romania, June 2004; Sibiu International Theatre Festival, Romania, May‚ÄìJune 2004. * Woof, Daddy (play), Written by Bryan Reynolds. **Productions: Director Amanda McRaven, Linhart Theater, New York City, August 2007.

During his tenure as an athlete, he won a national football championship with the 1957 Ohio State University Buckeyes and the 1964 NFL Championship with the Cleveland Browns. Because of his strong work ethic and occasional stubborn determination friends and teammates nicknamed him \\"The Mule\\". ==Early life and college career== Dick Schafrath was the first-born son of Norman and Mary, farmers of Irish-German descent. Their farm was located on the edge of Wooster, Ohio.Dick Schafrath: Carving Out a Life at Orange and Brown Report. At an early age, Dick learned his incredible work ethic while working alongside his father. By Dick's senior year of high school, the Cincinnati Reds and the Ohio State Buckeyes were actively recruiting Dick. Though his passion was baseball, the legendary Woody Hayes was persistent. In the end, Woody Hayes convinced Dick's parents and in the fall of 1955, Dick attended the Ohio State University. Schafrath quickly made an impression on the football field. While teams and players in this era were becoming specialized, coach Woody Hayes asked Dick to play both sides of the ball, as offensive tackle and defensive end. The team would go on to win the National Championship in 1957 and the 1958 Rose Bowl Game, as well as beating rival Michigan in 1957 and 1958. Schafrath was the Buckeyes' team captain in '58. During the Ohio State vs. Michigan game in '58, Michigan had the ball late in the fourth quarter, first and goal, with less than a minute clock, and down by 6 points. Dick was lined up as the right defensive end. The next play came his way and he hit the back causing a fumble and preserving the Ohio State win. ==NFL career== In 1959, during his senior year, Schafrath left Ohio State University to become the second NFL draft pick and join the Cleveland Browns. Drafted by the legendary and innovative Paul Brown, Dick was only 220 lbs. when he arrived as a rookie. Immediately, Dick began a then new, and unpopular, regimen of weight lifting on a regular basis. He also began to enter eating contests across the state. Within a year, Dick was 270 lbs. In 1964, the team won the NFL Championship against the Baltimore Colts 27-0. Schafrath's career with the Browns spanned 13 seasons, in which he was a fixture at the left tackle position. He protected the blind side of the Browns quarterbacks and opened holes for Hall of Fame Running Backs Jim Brown, Bobby Mitchell, and Leroy Kelly. Dick was selected to the All Pro Team four times, played in the Pro Bowl six times and was voted the Team's Most Valuable Player in 1963, the last year they held the distinction. He blocked against sixteen Hall of Fame Defensive Ends and thirteen Hall of Fame Linebackers. He was also elected to the Browns Legends Club in 2003. The Professional Football Researchers Association named Schafrath to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2007 ==Coaching in the NFL== After Dick retired from the Browns, he initially declined to coach, but finally decided to accept an offer by head coach George Allen of the Washington Redskins to join his coaching staff. From 1975 to 1977, Dick was the assistant offensive line coach. ==Politics== In 1983, Dick was recruited by President Ronald Reagan to coordinate and organize \\"Athletes for Reagan-Bush '84\\" in which celebrity athletes appeared at fundraisers and other functions in a re-election campaign effort. In 1986, with the help of longtime friend and coach Woody Hayes, Schafrath won a seat in the Ohio State Senate after running a successful campaign against state representative Tom Van Meter. He continued serving in the Ohio Senate until his retirement from politics in 2003. ==Facts and family== While Schafrath is known for his years as an athlete he also became known for his endless stunts and dares, including wrestling a bear, running 62 miles from Cleveland Browns stadium to Wooster High School stadium and canoeing across Lake Erie without stopping. Schafrath is a member of the Alpha-Sigma Chapter (Ohio State) of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity. Fifty years after leaving Ohio State University, Schafrath returned to complete his college diploma. On August 27, 2006, at the age of 69, he graduated from OSU with a B.S. in Sports and Leisure Studies. As part of his college coursework Schafrath wrote Heart of a Mule, an autobiography published by Gray & Company, Publishers in 2006. Dick has seven children from two marriages; Jefferson, Renee, Ty, Heidi, Bruin, Gerrit, and Isaac. He also has 16 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren. ==References== ==External links== *Interview of Dick Schafrath conducted by Dan Coughlin at Cleveland Public Library on May 2, 2017.

He was signed by the Redskins as an undrafted free agent in 2010. He played college football at Louisiana State University. He also played for the Detroit Lions. ==Early years== Williams began his prep career at Broussard middle school in Broussard Louisiana, then began his high school career at Northside High School in Lafayette, Louisiana, where he rushed for more than 2,500 yards and 30 touchdowns in his junior season. Williams was the Number three running back in the nation and number one in the state. He completed his eligibility at Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Virginia, where he became the first running back in school history to rush for more than 1,000 yards a season, finishing with 160 carries for 1,325 yards and 12 touchdowns. He was teammates with Vidal Hazelton, Jerrell Powe, and John Jerry. Williams was a highly sought recruit. After verbally committing to Louisiana State in January 2006 but refusing to sign on National Signing Day, Williams finally signed his letter of intent to LSU on February 10, 2006. ==College career== Playing as a true freshman in 2006 for LSU, Williams rushed for a total of 436 yards on carries and 5 touchdowns. At the 2007 Sugar Bowl versus Notre Dame Williams rushed for 107 yards on 14 attempts, scoring 2 touchdowns. Over the course of his career at LSU, Williams rushed for 1,699 yards on 299 carries and scored 17 rushing touchdowns. He also had 28 receptions for 273 yards and 2 touchdowns. ==Professional careerWashington Redskins=== Williams was signed by the Washington Redskins as an undrafted free agent following the 2010 NFL Draft. Although he had no carries in the regular season, Williams was activated for the week 5 game against the Green Bay Packers to back up Ryan Torain, who started for the injured Clinton Portis.

The network itself is open within the context of its accreditation ‚Äì it imposes no restrictions on traffic types carried across the network, restrictions and policy control is left to the connecting departments. Email traffic in and out of the network is filtered by an external provider. ==Origin== The concept of GSi was defined by the Cabinet Office, and was turned into practical reality by the Internet Special Products group of Cable & Wireless (then known as Mercury Communications) at their Brentford premises. GSi development started late 1996, and can be roughly dated by checking the registration date of its first domain name, 'gsi.net', registered 30 May 1997. The formal go-live date was several months later (according to the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA) this was February 1998). The main drivers behind the development of GSi was the plethora of inter-agency connections in UK government which made managing security and connectivity budgets problematic. GSi not only provided better oversight, it also normalised connectivity. GSi was designed as an accredited, dual link connected Internet protocol backbone, it imposed no restrictions on what type of traffic it carried; any restrictions were considered a policy decision for each connecting department. The design of GSi partly supported the then developing eGIF interoperability standards. This was a direct consequence of the two key technical people driving the project, one from Cable & Wireless, one from the UK government in the form of the CCTA. GSi uses SMTP as mail transport protocol, and the conversion from the then prevalent X.400 email facilities to SMTP proved for many departments an improvement in reliability and speed. In the case of X.400, this conversion also cut email costs substantially as X.400 message conversions were still chargeable even if the conversion failed due to message size. In some cases, the ROI of such an email conversion was as short as two months. The creation of GSi handed Cable & Wireless a monopoly on UK government data connectivity. GSi can be considered one of the more successful UK government IT projects from the point of view of take up - even when still in pilot phase, demand increased to a point where service windows had to be imposed to continue building the platform to full strength. The development of GSi was also the root of the creation of the CESG Listed Adviser Scheme (CLAS). During the build of GSi, the need for accredited advisers became clear as advice on connectivity invariably involved discussing government confidential matters. CESG eventually responded with the above CLAS scheme. ==Operations contract== GSi was operated on a five-year renewable contract basis. Energis won this contract from Cable & Wireless in August 2003. Cable & Wireless then bought Energis in 2005, thus regaining control over the platform. Cable and Wireless Worldwide won the GSi Convergence Framework (GCF) contract in 2011. The GSi and Managed Telecommunications Service (MTS) framework agreements finished in August 2011 with contracts running on to 12 February 2012. GCF is intended to facilitate the migration to the Public Services Network. ==Recent developments== Government Connect went live across local authorities in England and Wales. Government Connect is a pan-government programme providing an accredited and secure network between central government and every local authority in England and Wales and allows exchange of RESTRICTED information between authorities. The GCSX network is part of the wider GSi and provides connectivity to nearly all central departments. Scottish local authorities have already established a similar network known as the Government Secure Extranet (GSX). Local authorities with a GCSX connection can now use a GCSX email account to exchange sensitive data, including DWP benefits data, patient identifiable data, with health sector staff who have a NHS.net email address, e.g. PCT staff and GPs. As both GCSX and the Police National Network (PNN) are both connected to the wider Government Secure Intranet (GSi), data can be transferred securely between local authorities and the Police. GC Mail can be used now to replace the existing less efficient and less secure methods of exchanging data between local authorities and the Police. Local authorities that deliver Housing and Council Tax benefits are taking part in the e-Transfers programme, which is e-enabling the process for delivery of Local Authority Input Documents (LAIDs) and Local Authority Claim Information (LACIs). Version 4.1 of the Code of Connection for compliance was introduced in 2010. Compared with version 3.2 the main Code of Connection version 4.1 areas of are: * Mobile working - full implementation of compliant service * Firewall specification (EAL 4) * Execution of unauthorised software * Requirement for IT Healthchecks (CHECK / CREST / TigerScheme) * Labelling e-mails with protective markings. ==Public Services Network== The Public Services Network is a UK Government programme that unified the provision of network infrastructure across the United Kingdom public sector into an interconnected \\"network of networks\\". This included large elements of GSi. Centrally procured public sector networks migrated across to the PSN framework as they reach the end of their contract terms, either through an interim framework or directly. The Government Secure Intranet (GSi) contracts expired in September 2011, running on to 12 February 2012 and were replaced by the transitional Government Secure Intranet Convergence Framework (GCF). == References == Category:Computer networks Category:Information technology organisations based in the United Kingdom ","title":"Government Secure Intranet"},{"id":"9131096","text":"Gareth Lloyd Evans (born 2 November 1952 in Newport)History of Newport RFC is a former Wales international rugby union player.

He was the sport's 22nd yokozuna. He was well known for his extreme strength and skill. He won 99 out of 100 matches from 1909 to 1916 (not counting draws), and also won eleven top division tournament championships (two of them unofficial as they were before the championship system was established in 1909). ==Career== His real name was . Tachiyama joined Tomozuna stable at the insistence of Itagaki Taisuke and Saig≈ç Tsugumichi. However, he was so strong that most of the wrestlers in the stable were unable to practice with him. Therefore, Hitachiyama Taniemon became his practical coach. He was promoted to yokozuna in February 1911. His most feared skill was tsuki, or pushing. On the 3rd day of June 1910 tournament, Tachiyama's thrusts caused komusubi Kohitachi Yoshitaro to fly over spectators where he fell in the fourth row of seats. Kohitachi was wounded and left the tournament. Tachiyama is reported to have waved a shell weighing with one arm. He was, however, good on the mawashi as well. Much taller and stronger than his contemporaries, Tachiyama never had a losing record (make-koshi) in his eighteen-year career, and whilst at the yokozuna rank lost only three bouts. He once won 43 bouts in a row, lost one to Nishinoumi Kajir≈ç II, then won another 56 in a row. If he had not lost that match (which he claimed many years later was deliberate, to help out his rival yokozuna who was struggling at the time), he would have set an all-time record of 100 consecutive wins. As it stands, his second winning streak of 56 bouts, which began on the 9th day of the January 1912 tournament, is the fifth best in history after Futabayama, Tanikaze, Hakuho and Umegatani I. His run ended on the 8th day of May 1916 tournament, when he was finally defeated by Tochigiyama Moriya. On the final day of January 1917 tournament, he was defeated by ≈ånishiki Uichir≈ç. Tochigiyama and ≈ånishiki were pupils of Hitachiyama. After this second loss, he retired. In 1917, he said to wrestlers, \\"I will give you one bale of rice if you can walk around the dohy≈ç shouldering me.\\" A boy, who had not made his debut in professional sumo yet, acceded to his request. He failed at the first attempt but succeeded at the second. About 15 years later, that boy became yokozuna Tamanishiki San'emon. His style of yokozuna dohy≈ç-iri (ring-entering ceremony) came to be known as Shiranui after it was imitated by later yokozuna Haguroyama. However, he insisted that his style was Unry≈´ Ky≈´kichi's. His sheer strength and physical presence drew comparisons with Raiden Tameemon, but also meant he was perhaps less popular with the general public than his predecessors Hitachiyama and Umegatani II. After retiring from active competition he was briefly an elder of the Sumo Association under the name Azumazeki, but left the sumo world in May 1919. In 1937 he became the first yokozuna to perform a kanreki dohy≈ç-iri, or '60th year ring entrance ceremony' to commemorate his years as yokozuna. ==Top Division Record== *Championships for the best record in a tournament were not recognized or awarded before the 1909 summer tournament and the above championships that are labelled \\"unofficial\\" are historically conferred.

Having started his football career at his hometown club Newport County, making his professional debut at the age of 16 in 1976, he went on to make over 500 appearances in the Football League, most notably for Charlton Athletic, Leeds United and Bristol City, and gained 39 caps for Wales. Following his retirement, Aizlewood worked as an assistant manager with Carmarthen Town on two occasions and later worked as assistant manager to Ian Rush at Chester City. He also spent two years as the technical director of the Welsh Football Trust, being placed in charge of developing youth football in Wales. In 2012, he returned to Welsh Premier League side Carmarthen Town as manager and lead the club to consecutive Welsh League Cup victories in 2013 and 2014. His contract as manager was terminated after he was convicted of serious fraud in February 2018. ==Early life== Aizlewood was born in Newport and grew up in the Ringland area. His father was a steelworker who had moved to Newport from Wolverhampton. As a child, he attended Alway Juniors School and then Hartridge High School in Newport. His older brother Steve was also a professional footballer. ==Playing career== After playing for local youth club Cromwell, Aizlewood joined his home-town club Newport County at the age of 14, turning down an offer to join Arsenal. Earning a wage of five pounds per week to cover expenses, he made his professional debut two years later at the age of just 16, whilst he was still attending school. He played for Newport for three years, leaving in 1978 to join Luton Town for a fee of ¬£50,000, becoming David Pleat's first signing at the club. After four seasons at Luton, winning the Second Division title in his final year, he moved on to Charlton Athletic in 1982, again for a fee of ¬£50,000. He was later appointed club captain and was named the club's player of the year for both the 1984‚Äì85 and 1985‚Äì86 seasons. In 1987, Charlton received an offer of ¬£200,000 from Leeds United for Aizlewood. Despite resistance from manager Lennie Lawrence, Aizlewood decided to accept the move as the club were then managed by one of his boyhood idols, Billy Bremner. Signed as a replacement for Ian Snodin, who had left the club to join Everton, he made his debut in a goalless draw with Sheffield United on 7 February 1987. He became influential almost immediately, missing just one league match for the rest of the season as Leeds finished in fourth position and went on to reach the play-off final, losing to his former club Charlton. Aizlewood was also appointed club captain. However, the following season, Leeds struggled to repeat their good form, following the sales of Andy Ritchie and Ian Baird, and Bremner was sacked from his position as manager. Aizlewood himself became a target for some fans frustration and during a Second Division clash with Walsall at the end of the 1988‚Äì89 season, he reacted to jeers by Leeds' own fans by displaying a V sign, an offensive gesture in the UK, to the crowd after scoring in the closing stages to make the score 1‚Äì0. Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson quickly substituted Aizlewood, who blew kisses to the crowd and removed his captain's armband, for David Batty. He reacted furiously toward Wilkinson and refused a seat on the bench, returning straight to the dressing room. He left the club soon after in a ¬£125,000 move to Bradford City, with Aizlewood keen to remain in Yorkshire where his family was settled, reuniting Aizlewood with his former manager at international level, Terry Yorath. He spent one season at Valley Parade, making 39 league appearances, before moving on to Bristol City. He spent three seasons with Bristol, making over 100 appearances in all competitions and scoring three times. In 1993, he returned to Wales to sign for Cardiff City. In his one full season at Ninian Park, the club narrowly avoided relegation to Division Three but did reach the final of the Welsh Cup, losing 2‚Äì1 to Barry Town. He was also named man of the match in the club's 1‚Äì0 FA Cup Fourth Round victory over Premier League side Manchester City in January 1994. During the following season, Aizlewood decided to leave the club in order to take up a player-coach role at Merthyr Tydfil. He later finished his career with spells at Welsh Premier League sides Aberystwyth Town and Cwmbran Town before retiring in 2000. ==International career== Having previously captained Wales at youth level, Aizlewood played twice for the Wales under-21 side, making his debut in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to England on 6 February 1979 before winning his second cap a year later in September 1980 in a 2‚Äì0 victory over the Netherlands. Aizlewood made his debut for the Wales senior side on 25 February 1986, during a 2‚Äì1 victory over Saudi Arabia in Riyadh. His last appearance came on 14 December 1994 as Wales lost 3‚Äì0 to Bulgaria in a Euro 96 qualifier at Cardiff Arms Park. He finished his career having won 39 caps for Wales without scoring. ==Management and coaching careerFAW Trust=== In 2001, Aizlewood was appointed as technical director of the Welsh Football Trust, a governing body of the Football Association of Wales (FAW), following the resignation of Mike Rigg, a role which he described as his \\"dream job\\". However, despite increasing the trust's coaching revenues by 75 per cent during his time in charge, he was sacked in December 2003 following an altercation with a BBC camera crew and presenter. During filming of an interview BBC investigative programme X-Ray, Aizlewood reportedly attempted to forcibly remove a tape from a camera and chased the crew from the trust's offices in Cardiff. He was also accused of assaulting presenter Jane Harvey by \\"grabbing her around the neck and pushing her down a flight of steps\\" with Harvey describing him as \\"berserk\\". He was later convicted of assaulting Harvey and ordered to pay a fine of ¬£1,800 and his conduct was described by the judge as \\"entirely inappropriate.\\" ===Chester City=== Aizlewood had a spell on the coaching staff of Carmarthen Town during 2003‚Äì04, but left to become assistant manager to Ian Rush at Chester City for 2004‚Äì05. The club made a strong start to the season, embarking on a ten match unbeaten run, and Rush was linked to the vacant Wales job but a difficult period in the second half of the season, winning just 2 out of 10 matches, saw the club fall down the table and pressure grew on Rush and his management team. On 4 April 2005, Aizlewood was sacked by Chester chairman Stephen Vaughan without Rush's knowledge. Rush himself resigned two days later in protest of the decision, stating \\"Loyalty is vital in football and I am a loyal person. When a valued member of my team is dismissed against my wishes, I have no option but to follow my principles.\\" When the pair left the club, Chester were nine points clear of the relegation zone, having been bottom of the table when they arrived. Rush later described Aizlewood as \\"one of the best coaches I have worked with.\\" ===Carmarthen Town=== Aizlewood worked as an agent briefly after leaving Chester as well as managing his business interests. Having considered leaving football, he was handed his first job as manager in January 2012 by Jeff Thomas, chairman of Carmarthen Town. Returning to the club to replace Tomi Morgan, having previously worked there as assistant manager to Andrew York and Deryn Brace in separate spells. The club were joint bottom of the Welsh Premier League on his appointment, along with Newtown, but Aizlewood was able to steer them away from relegation. The following year, Aizlewood lead the club to the Welsh League Cup final, defeating The New Saints on penalties to claim the trophy for only the second time in the club's history. They retained the trophy in the 2013‚Äì14 season, defeating Bala Town in the final. In November 2014, Aizlewood attempted to register himself as a player for Carmarthen, at the age of 55, following an injury crisis at the club prior to a league fixture against Rhyl. However, the plans were ended following a fire at Rhyl's ground which postponed the fixture. He was sacked by the club in February 2018 following his fraud conviction after six years in charge. ==Personal lifeAddiction battle=== Aizlewood speaks Welsh, having taken up lessons during a long injury spell as a player. After becoming proficient with the language he entered the Welsh Learner of the Year competition at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in Llandeilo where he was named as the winner. He released his Welsh language autobiography in 2009, entitled Amddiffyn fy Hun (Defending Myself) in which he revealed his 27-year-long battle with alcoholism and gambling and contemplating suicide. All proceeds from the book were donated to former England player Tony Adams Sporting Chance charity. His alcohol problem began as an 18-year-old, during his time at Luton Town where he found himself with a large disposable income. Remarking on this period, Aizlewood has stated: \\"I was making a very good living [...] sometimes I didn't drink for two or three weeks, but then I'd drink for three of four days in one go.\\" At his worst, Aizlewood was able to drink a bottle of brandy and 20 pints of lager in one session and still stand. He also developed a gambling addiction and has admitted to losing up to ¬£30,000 in a single day. In his book, Aizlewood confessed to once nearly attempting suicide during a trip to Rome in 2003 due to the severity of his addictions. He stated that on 14 February, he had stood on a motorway bridge in the Italian capital in the early hours of the morning and considered jumping 50 ft to the carriageway below, commenting \\" I didn't have an ounce of fear as I stood on the small wall and looked down at the cars speeding along the road 50ft below me, because I only had one intention: to jump.\\" ===Punditry=== Following his retirement from playing, Aizlewood worked as a pundit for BBC Wales, covering Welsh football, where he developed a reputation as an outspoken critic. He was particularly critical of Swansea City and their decision to sign several foreign players whilst playing in the lower leagues. Swansea forward Giovanni Savarese, along with other players, was branded unreliable by Aizlewood and, following Savarese being dismissed for a deliberate elbow on Wrexham defender Mark McGregor during the 2001 FAW Premier Cup final, Aizlewood was accused of racism after calling Savarese a \\"coward\\" and stating \\"but that's foreigners for you\\". His outspoken views of Swansea and their players made him a target for fans of the club and, in October 2002, Aizlewood was attacked by a group of Swansea fans, after commentating at a game against Rochdale at Vetch Field, who pushed him into a gate, causing him to suffer grazing to his eye. BBC Wales head of sport, Nigel Walker demanded that the club would assure Aizlewood's safety at future matches following the incident. ==Fraud conviction== After an investigation by various newspapers, in 2012, Aizlewood was one of three men arrested in connection with allegations of fraud regarding ¬£1.6m of government funds that had been given to Luis Michael Training Ltd based in Newport, a company where Aizlewood was serving as a director. The company offered football apprenticeships, promising to provide full-time training in football coaching as well as work experience and a ¬£95 weekly salary, to up to 3,800 students. However, the company focused on targeting young players from youth clubs between 2009 and 2011, fraudulently obtaining around ¬£5m of public funds, used by the Skills Funding Agency to create apprenticeships for vulnerable young people. On investigation by Gwent Police and the Fraud office of the Metropolitan Police, the prosecution claimed that for every apprentice enrolled in the youth scheme, the defendants claimed funds provided by the UK government. It was also found that many students on their books did not even exist, whilst many of the youngsters that were listed lived far outside the reach of the scheme, or were doing less than four hours of study a week. Aizlewood was later banned from serving as a director of any company for six years, along with fellow ex-footballer Paul Sugrue and two others. In June 2016, Aizlewood was charged following an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. He appeared at Southwark Crown Court in November 2017. In his defence, Aizlewood stated that he had neither the \\"time or inclination\\" to take part in the fraud due to a troubled home life with his wife Penny suffering from alcohol and drug addiction. Penny later committed suicide in 2016 following their break-up. In January 2018 he was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation, after taking money in the fake apprenticeship scheme. Aizlewood was convicted alongside Sugrue and four other directors. Judge Michael Tomlinson described the case as \\"very serious\\" and released the defendants on bail until sentencing at a later date. He was later jailed for six years starting from his conviction in February 2018. ==HonoursPlayer=== Luton Town * Football League Second Division winners: 1981‚Äì92 Cardiff City * Welsh Cup runners-up: 1993‚Äì94 ===Manager=== Carmarthen Town * Welsh League Cup Winner: 2012‚Äì13, 2013‚Äì14 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Newport, Wales Category:Newport County A.F.C. players Category:Luton Town F.C. players Category:Charlton Athletic F.C. players Category:Leeds United F.C. players Category:Bradford City A.F.C. players Category:Bristol City F.C. players Category:Cardiff City F.C. players Category:Merthyr Tydfil F.C. players Category:Aberystwyth Town F.C. players Category:Cwmbr√¢n Town A.F.C. players Category:Welsh footballers Category:Wales under-21 international footballers Category:Wales international footballers Category:English Football League players Category:Cymru Premier players Category:Chester City F.C. non- playing staff Category:Welsh football managers Category:Carmarthen Town A.F.C. managers Category:Association football defenders Category:Cymru Premier managers Category:Welsh fraudsters Category:Welsh criminals ","title":"Mark Aizlewood"},{"id":"9131166","text":"Benny's Video is a 1992 Austrian-Swiss psychological horror film directed by Michael Haneke and set in Vienna. The plot of the film centers on Benny (Arno Frisch), a teenager who views much of his life as distilled through video images, and his well-to-do parents Anna (Angela Winkler) and Georg (Ulrich M√ºhe), who enable Benny's focus on video cameras and images. The film won the FIPRESCI Award at the 1993 European Film Awards. ==Plot== The film opens with a home video of the slaughter with a captive bolt pistol of a pig on a European farm. The video rewinds to play the slaughter in slow motion, which emphasizes the hand-held barrel against the pig's fore-skull and the cartridge explosion. A party centered on a game called Pilot and Passengers is broken up by Georg and Anna when they return home in the middle of the party. Eva, their daughter who lives separately from them, is the host of the party, and it is revealed through the questioning of Georg and Anna's son, Benny, that Eva has taken advantage of her parent's planned absence to host the impromptu party in their house. While his parents are away for the weekend, Benny invites a girl (Ingrid Stassner) he has seen outside the local video store to his home. He shows her the video of the pig slaughter, and they talk about the film. She asks him if he made the film himself, then asks how it was seeing the pig die, and if he's ever seen a real dead person. Benny replies that he has not, and that the corpses in movies are all fake. He then unveils and loads the slaughtering gun. He holds it against his chest, and dares the girl to discharge it. When she refuses, he calls her a coward. He holds it against her chest, and when he hesitates, she calls him a coward also. He fires the gun, and she falls. Her falling reveals a video monitor, on which we see her crawling away from Benny and completely out of frame. We then see Benny running to reload the gun and returning to shoot her a second time, the girl crawling back partially into frame, and finally Benny reloading and firing a third time, this time killing her. After choir practice, Benny returns home. There, as the weekend begins, Benny covers the girl's body and goes through her school bag, arranges an evening out with friends, then moves the girl's body to a closet and cleans up the blood. Some of the cleanup is seen through a video monitor while Benny edits a video of the experience. Benny goes out to a dance club and stays overnight at his friend's house. On his way home, he goes to a cinema, window shops, and gets his hair shorn to the scalp. After his parents return, his father harangues Benny about his haircut, asking if Benny had any thought about how others would react to him now. Later on, while the family is watching the news in Benny's room, Benny switches the signal to the video he has made of himself killing the girl. Benny reveals the body in his closet, and Georg removes the videotape. He asks if anyone else knows about this, and through careful grilling finds that there are no witnesses. Clearly disturbed, the father and mother leave Benny's room. In the living room, Georg dispassionately lists the options they have: either to alert the authorities, with a resulting judgment of parental neglect and placement of their son in a psychiatric institution, or to destroy the evidence. Anna urges that any option chosen must be carefully followed to its end. Anna takes Benny on vacation to Egypt, and the ever-present video camera captures them both in their hotel, in the village, touring ancient tombs, watching sail-gliders at the beach, and even a private moment of Anna in the bathroom. There are several phone calls from a booth in the post office, with Benny and Anna separately taking the phone. Benny seems barely affected by the murder he committed, and he seems unable to fathom why his mother breaks down in sobs at one point during the vacation. When they return home after six days, the apartment is clean of any trace of the girl. Georg, who had stayed at home, succeeded in cutting the body into small enough pieces to be flushed down the toilet or otherwise removed. That evening, Georg asks Benny why he killed her, and Benny replies, \\"I don't know. ...I wanted to see what it's like, possibly.\\" Benny shrugs in answer to Georg asking how it was. On video, we see another Pilot and Passengers party hosted by Eva, this time with Georg and Anna's permission. In reality, we see Anna and Georg watching the video with Benny and discussing how well their daughter does playing the game. Later, Georg and Anna attend the concert of the choir Benny is in. Again in reality, a voice-over asks, \\"Why did you come to us now?\\" We see Benny being interviewed by policemen, and he answers merely, \\"Because.\\" With no following questions, Benny asks if he can leave now. Afterwards, Benny meets Georg and Anna in the hall and, after a long moment, says, \\"Entschuldigung.\\" (\\"Sorry\\"). ==Cast== * Arno Frisch as Benny * Angela Winkler as Anna, Benny's mother * Ulrich M√ºhe as Georg, Benny's father * Stephanie Brehme as Evi * Stefan Polasek as Ricci * Ingrid Stassner as M√§dchen * Christian Pundy * Max Berner * Hanspeter M√ºller * Shelley K√§stner ==Reception== Benny‚Äôs Video has a 64% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 60/100 on Metacritic. == Year-end list == * Honorable mention ‚Äì William Arnold, Seattle Post-Intelligencer ==References== ==External links== * Category:1992 films Category:1992 horror films Category:1992 drama films Category:Austrian films Category:Austrian horror films Category:Swiss films Category:Swiss horror films Category:German- language films Category:English-language films Category:Arabic-language films Category:French-language films Category:Films directed by Michael Haneke Category:Films about filmmaking Category:Films set in Egypt Category:Films shot in Vienna Category:Austrian independent films Category:Swiss independent films Category:Snuff films in fiction ","title":"Benny's Video"},{"id":"9131173","text":"The Sea Hunters II: More True Adventures with Famous Shipwrecks is a nonfiction work by adventure novelist Clive Cussler published in the United States in 2002.

The home was established by Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini in 1890, and was closed in 2011. ==Founding== Mother Cabrini, founder of the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, traveled from Italy to New York City in 1889 with six of her Sisters, after Pope Leo XIII asked them to serve the burgeoning population of Italian emigrants to the United States. Within weeks of arriving in New York, the Sisters were caring for a small group of orphaned or unsupervised young girls in a donated Fifth Avenue apartment. Realizing that they needed a larger property, with land, to provide for the children, Cabrini purchased a property in rural West Park from the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) to serve as an orphanage for Italian immigrant girls. Because the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart is a begging order, all properties purchased by the Sisters are and were funded through gifts and loans, and not the Catholic Church. The West Park property included a monastery and working farm. Having run their well dry, and believing there to be no water on the grounds, the Jesuits sold the property at a fraction of its worth. Cabrini envisioned digging for a spring that would provide enough water for the fledgling orphanage. Surprisingly, the spring, found just up the hill to the west of the main road, provides water to the campus to this day.St. Cabrini Spring. Within weeks of opening the orphanage, the Sisters began accepting children with a variety of backgrounds from Poughkeepsie, Newburgh, Kingston, and other local communities. Archives from this period were maintained in a museum room on the campus.St. Cabrini Home. St. Cabrini Home served as the novitiate and United States home base for Mother Cabrini and her Sisters for decades. Upon her death in Chicago on December 22, 1917, Cabrini was buried at her beloved West Park campus, as per her wishes. Her body was exhumed and divided in 1933 as part of her canonization process. The major portion was transferred to the chapel of Mother Cabrini High School in New York City, and now rests in the St. Frances Xavier Cabrini Shrine adjoining the school.\\"St. Frances Xavier Cabrini Shrine, New York\\". Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. ==Expansion and community support== Mother Cabrini's canonization in 1946 brought new attention to the orphanage, attracting visitors from around the world. In 1959, the agency officially incorporated as St. Cabrini Home, Inc., which brought changes in governance. In 1968, the agency began accepting the infant brothers of girls already in care at the home. The campus program remained co-ed until 2004. St. Cabrini Home also expanded its programs to provide community-based living in group homes locally. Throughout these changes, and as Cabrini's worldwide network of institutions grew, her Sisters relied on the support of the communities surrounding the orphanage. This support included donations of food, supplies, and money; local families volunteering to host orphaned children for the holidays; and recreational outings sponsored by local businesspeople. Eventually, much of the agency's work was performed by dedicated laypeople, and community support remains critical to the Sisters' legacy. ==Later difficulties and closure== In 2004, the center reverted to an all-female facility, licensed by the New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services.New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services. On August 5, 2009, a young woman committed suicide by jumping in front of a truck on Route 9W. The Benedictine Hospital, the Daily Freeman newspaper, and several witnesses all documented that the young woman was extremely depressed and expressed an urge to kill herself prior to the incident because the hospital had released her back to the Cabrini home, despite her wishes not to return. On April 13, 2010, cottage supervisor Howard Wilson was arrested and charged with raping a 16-year-old female resident of the facility. In 2011, Wilson pleaded guilty to felony rape. On September 4, 2010, a rock- and debris-throwing incident led to a state trooper's patrol car being hit with a cinderblock chunk. In addition to the alleged perpetrators, two Cabrini staffers were also arrested on charges of acting in a manner injurious to a minor for, as police put it, \\"doing little or nothing to stop the girls during the roughly two hours that they threw rocks and other debris at cars zipping along the highway.\\" After the suicide, rape, and stone-throwing, the Cabrini facility for young women was closed in 2011. The brick school built on the estate in 1934 was demolished in 2017. ==References== ==External links== *Cabrini Mission Foundation Category:Buildings and structures in Ulster County, New York Category:Defunct organizations based in New York (state) Category:Non-profit organizations based in New York (state) Category:Cabrini Sisters schools ","title":"St. Cabrini Home"},{"id":"9131207","text":"was a Japanese professional sumo wrestler.

Griffiths ran unsuccessfully as the BC Liberal candidate for a 2008 provincial byelection in the Vancouver-Burrard riding. In June 2016, Griffiths was inducted to the British Columbia Sports Hall of Fame and is the recipient of the W.A.C Bennett Award, which is given \\"to an individual who has made a significant, unique and lasting contribution to sport in the Province of British Columbia.\\" He and his father Frank are the only father and son that have been bestowed with this honour in the history of BC Sports Hall of Fame. ==Professional sports== Griffiths is the son of Emily and Frank Griffiths. The Griffiths family, including Arthur, were inducted into the British Columbia Hockey Hall of Fame in 1995 under the builder category. The induction noted \\"In addition to his duties as owner of the team, Arthur Griffiths was also actively involved at the league level as a member of the NHL's Marketing / Public Relations Committee.\\" The younger Griffiths inherited his father's ownership stake in the Vancouver Canucks in 1988. It was Griffiths who led the initiative to build GM Place. The original arena of the Canucks, the Pacific Coliseum, was owned by the Pacific National Exhibition. The old coliseum became unsuitable for the growing team, and as result Griffiths financed the building of GM Place in 1995. Griffiths sold the Vancouver Canucks in 1997. On running the Canucks, Griffiths' is quoted, \\"It was a wonderful life experience that many people would give their right arm for and I'm blessed that I had it.\\" Griffiths was also responsible for the formation of the NBA's Vancouver Grizzlies, who began play in 1995. The Grizzlies were sold and eventually moved to Memphis, Tennessee in 2001. ==2010 Winter Olympics== In 1998, Griffiths was invited to chair the not-for-profit Vancouver/Whistler 2010 Bid Society. In December 1998, the Bid Society obtained the Canadian Olympic Committee's endorsement of Vancouver's bid to host the 2010 Games, so that the bid could be presented before the International Olympic Committee (IOC). In 2002, the Vancouver/Whistler 2010 Bid Society was replaced by Vancouver 2010 Bid Corporation. On July 2, 2003, the International Olympic Committee announced that it had awarded the 2010 Winter Olympics to Vancouver/Whistler, beating competing bids from Salzburg, Austria, and Pyeongchang, South Korea. The successful bid represented the first Winter Olympics Games to be awarded to Canada since Calgary won its bid for the 1988 Winter Olympics. == Business career == Griffiths began working in the front office of the Vancouver Canucks in 1981 at the age of 23 when the NHL franchise was controlled by his father, Frank Griffiths, Sr. He assumed full control of the team in 1988 and his father died in 1994, months before the team's run to the Stanley Cup Finals. In 1995, the Vancouver Grizzlies joined the NBA as an expansion team under Griffiths' ownership. On November 12, 1996, Griffiths sold his remaining interest in Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment, the entity that owned the Canucks and Grizzlies, to his Seattle business partner, billionaire John McCaw. Griffiths oversaw hospitality for Russian sportswear brand Bosco at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London and the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. On February 26, 2019, Griffiths joined the Board of Directors and was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Vancouver- based cannabis company, World Farms Corp. == Canuck Place == From Canuck Place's official website, \\"Canuck Place is the first free-standing hospice for children in North America and its model of care has been used for many hospices...\\" \\"The goal of this specialized care, known as pediatric palliative care, is to enhance the comfort and quality of life for both the child and their family.

(example - fire, animals, insect, fungi, injurious plants and adverse climatic conditions.) This forest protection also has a legal status and rather than protection from only people damaging the forests is seen to be broader and include forest pathology too. Thus due to this the different emphases around the world paradoxically suggest different things for forest protection. In German-speaking countries, forest protection would focus on the biotic and abiotic factors that are non-crime related. A protected forest is not the same as a protection forest. These terms can lead to some confusion in English, although they are clearer in other languages. As a result, reading English literature can be problematic for non-experts due to localization and conflation of meanings. The types of man-induced abuse that forest protection seeks to prevent include: * Aggressive or unsustainable farming and logging * Pollution of soil on which forests grow * Expanding city development caused by population explosion and the resulting urban sprawl There is considerable debate over the effectiveness of forest protection methods. Enforcement of laws regarding purchased forest land is weak or non-existent in most parts of the world. In the increasingly dangerous South America, home of major rainforests, officials of the Brazilian National Agency for the Environment (IBAMA) have recently been shot during their routine duties. ==Land purchase== One simple type of forest protection is the purchasing of land in order to secure it, or in order to plant trees (afforestation). It can also mean forest management or the designation of areas such as natural reservoirs which are intended to be left to themselves. However, merely purchasing a piece of land does not prevent it from being used by others for poaching and illegal logging. ==On site monitoring== A better way to protect a forest, particularly old growth forests in remote areas, is to obtain a part of it and to live on and monitor the purchased land. Even in the United States, these measures sometimes don't suffice because arson can burn a forest to the ground, leaving burnt areas free for different use. Another issue about living on purchased forest-land is that there may not be a suitable site for a standard home without clearing land, which defies the purpose of protection. Alternatives include building a treehouse or an earthhouse. This is being done currently by indigenous people in South America to protect large reservoirs. In former times, North American Native Americans used to live in tipies or mandan earthhouses, which also require less land. An undertaking to develop modern treehouses is being taken by a company from Germany called \\"TrueSchool treehouses\\". ==Methods of protection== A number of less successful methods of forest protection have been tried, such as the trade in certified wood. Protecting a small section of land in a larger forest may also have limited value. For example, tropical rainforests can die if they decrease in size, since they are dependent on the moist microclimate which they create. There is an excellent article in National Geographic October issue concerning redwood forest in California and their effort to maintain forest and rainforest. A compromise is to conduct agriculture and stock farming, or sustainable wood management. This ascribes different values to forest land and farmland, for which many areas are clear felled. =='Neighborhood leakage'== Two conflicting studies on the idea that protecting forests only relocates deforestation. This is called neighborhood leakage. According to the paradox of forest protection protected areas such as rural settlements near protected zones grew at twice the rate of those elsewhere. The IUCN implements such protocols that protect over 670 eco-regions. 46% of the eco-regions had less than 10% forest protection. Which means that these areas are not being monitored as they should and the protection is not working. Considering forest protection within global priority areas was unsatisfactory. An example given was that the average protection of 8.4% in biodiversity hotspots. Results have policy relevance in terms of the target of the Convention on Biological Diversity, reconfirmed in 2008, to conserve in an effective manner that ‚Äúat least 10% of each of the world‚Äôs forest types‚Äù. ==Urban forests== A recent discovery in Europe relating to forest protection is that urban areas have forests of their own. Many cities have tens of thousands of trees which constitute forests. In addition the air in the cities is lately becoming better, providing conditions favorable for small associated species such as mosses and lichens. ==See also== * Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures * Conservation biology * Conservation ethic * Conservation movement * Conservation reliant species * Deep ecology * Ecology * Ecology movement * Environmentalism * Environmental movement * Environmental protection * Habitat conservation * List of environmental organizations * Natural environment * Natural capital * Natural landscape * Natural resource * Protection forest * Renewable resource * Sustainable development * Sustainability * Sustainable agriculture * Water conservation ==References== ==External links== *Forests in danger *Roadmap to Recovery: The World's Last Intact Forest Landscapes *Global Forest Resources Assessment 2005 *CoolForests.org - Conservation Cools the Planet latest forest preservation techniques Category:Forest conservation ","title":"Forest protection"},{"id":"9131254","text":"The first-generation Chevrolet Camaro is an American pony car which appeared in Chevrolet dealerships on September 29, 1966 for the 1967 model year on a brand-new rear wheel drive GM F-body platform and was available as a 2-door, 2+2 seat, hardtop (no \\"B\\" or center pillar) or convertible, with the choice of either a straight-6 or V8 engine. The first-generation Camaro was built through the 1969 model year. Almost all of 1967-1969 Camaros were built in the two U.S. assembly plants: Norwood, Ohio and Van Nuys, California. There were also five non-U.S. Camaro assembly plants in countries that required local assembly and content. These plants were located in the Philippines, Belgium, Switzerland, Venezuela, and Peru. ==Options== The Camaro's standard drivetrain was either a straight-6 engine rated at at 4400 rpm and of torque at 1600 rpm; or a and (later in 1969) V8s, with a standard three-speed manual transmission. There were 8 (in 1967), 10 (in 1968), and 12 (in 1969) different engines available in 1967-1969 Camaros. There were several optional transmissions. A four-speed manual was available with any engine. The two-speed \\"Powerglide\\" automatic transmission was available all three years. The three-speed \\"Turbo Hydra-Matic 350\\" automatic became available starting in 1969. The optional automatic for SS 396 cars was the Turbo 400 three-speed automatic. There was a plethora of other options available all three years, including three main packages: The RS was an appearance package that included hidden headlights, revised taillights with back-up lights under the rear bumper, RS badging, and exterior bright trim. It was available on any model. The SS performance package consisted of a or V8s and chassis upgrades for better handling and to deal with the additional power. The SS featured non-functional air inlets on the hood, special striping, and SS badging. The Z/28 performance package was designed (with further modifications) to compete in the SCCA Trans-Am Series. It included a solid-lifter V8, 4-speed transmission, power disc brakes, and two wide \\"skunk\\" stripes down the hood and trunk lid. The idea of offering such a wide variety of packages and numerous options was to \\"blanket\\" Camaro's end of the personal car market with everything from an entry level I6 cylinder engine to multiple high-performance V8 engines. == 1967 == 1967 Camaro convertible, base six-cylinder model The 1967 Camaro shared the subframe / semi-unibody design with the 1968 Chevy II Nova. Almost 80 factory and 40 dealer options, including three main packages, were available: the RS, the SS, and the Z/28. The SS included a producing at 4800 rpm and at 3200 rpm of torque; and the L35 and L78 big-block V8 engines producing at 5600 rpm and at 3600 rpm of torque were available. The SS featured non-functional air inlets on the hood, special striping, and SS badging on the grille, front fenders, gas cap, and horn button. It was possible to order both the SS and RS options, making it a SS/RS. In 1967, a Camaro SS/RS convertible with a 396 engine paced the Indianapolis 500. The Z/28 option code was introduced in December 1966 for the 1967 model year. It was the brainchild of Vince Piggins, who conceived offering \\"virtually race-ready\\" Camaros for sale from any Chevrolet dealer.Rod Action, 2/85, p.31. This option package was not mentioned in any sales literature, so it was unknown to most buyers. The Z/28 option required front disc power brakes and a Muncie 4-speed manual close-ratio transmission (posi-traction was optional). It featured a V-8, stroke crankshaft with bore, an aluminum intake manifold, and a 4-barrel vacuum secondary Holley carburetor of 780 cfm. The engine was designed specifically to race in the Trans Am series (which required engines smaller than ). Advertised power of this engine was listed at . This is an under-rated figure. Chevrolet wanted to keep the horsepower rating at less than 1 hp per cubic inch, for various reasons (e.g. insurance and racing classes). The factory rating of 290 hp occurred at 5300 rpm, while actual peak for the high-revving 302 was closer to (with the single four barrel carb) and (with optional dual-four barrel carbs) at 6800-7000 rpm. The Z/28 also came with upgraded suspension, racing stripes on the hood and trunk lid, '302' front fender emblems on the 67 and early 68 cars, and 'Z/28' emblems in late 68 & 69\\\\. It was also possible to combine the Z/28 package with the RS package. Only 602 Z/28s were sold in 1967, along with approximately 100 Indianapolis Pace Car replicas. The 1967 and 1968 Z/28s did not have the cowl induction hood, optional on the 1969 Z/28s. The 1967 Z28 received air from an open element air cleaner or from an optional cowl plenum duct attached to the side of the air cleaner that ran to the firewall and got air from the cowl vents. 15-inch rally wheels were included with Z/28s while all other 1967-9 Camaros had 14-inch wheels. The origin of the Z/28 nameplate came from the RPO codes - RPO Z28 was the code for the Special Performance Package. RPO Z27 was for the Super Sport package. Cars assembled in Switzerland, at GM's local facility in Biel, were all coupes with the V8 that produced at 4800 rpm and at 2400 rpm \\\\- an engine which was not available in contemporary Camaros built in the United States. The Swiss-built Camaros were not available with the three-speed manual and had a differential lock and front disc brakes as standard. Some additional safety equipment was also standard.

With the introduction of Astro Ventilation, a fresh-air-inlet system, the side vent windows were deleted. Side marker lights were added on the front and rear fenders which was a government requirement for all 1968 vehicles. It also had a more pointed front grille and divided rear taillights. The front running lights (on non-RS models) were also changed from circular to oval. The big block SS models received chrome hood inserts that imitated velocity stacks and low-gloss black rear tail light panel. The rear shock absorber mounting was staggered to resolve wheel hop issues and higher performance models received multi-leaf rear springs instead of single-leaf units. A producing at 5200 rpm and of torque at 3400 rpm big block engine was added as an option for the SS, and the Z28 appeared in Camaro brochures. The was not available as a Regular Production Option (RPO). Several dealers, such as Baldwin-Motion, Dana, and Yenko, offered the 427 as a dealer-installed replacement for the factory-supplied engine. Chevrolet's Special Production Division wanted to promote the Z28. They had to convince Chevrolet's General Manager Pete Estes, but the General Manager only drove convertible vehicles, and the Z/28 was never produced as a convertible. A Central Office Production Order (COPO) was placed for the only Z/28 convertible Camaro ever created. The car was placed in the executive garage which Pete Estes had access to. Upon driving the vehicle, he promptly gave approval for promotion of the Z/28. A 1968 Z/28 famously competed in the 1971 British Saloon Car Championship at Crystal Palace in a three-way battle for the lead, a race which was later featured in the BBC's ‚Äú100 Greatest Sporting Moments‚Äù.

The grille was redesigned with a heavy \\"V\\" cant and deeply inset headlights. New door skins, rear quarter panels, and rear valance panel also gave the car a much lower, wider, more aggressive look. This styling would serve for the 1969 model year only. To increase competitiveness in the SCCA Trans-Am racing series, optional four wheel disc brakes with four-piston calipers were made available during the year, under RPO JL8, for US$500.30.General Motors documentation This system used components from the Corvette and made for a major improvement in the braking capability and was a key to winning the Trans-Am championship. The option was expensive and only 206 units were produced. The Rally Sport (RS) option, RPO Z22, includes special black painted grille with concealed headlights and headlight washers, fender striping (except when sport striping or Z28 Special Performance Package is specified), simulated rear fender louvers, front and rear wheel opening moldings, black body sill, RS emblems on grille, steering wheel and rear panel, Rally Sport front fender nameplates, bright accented taillights, back-up lights below rear bumper; also includes bright roof drip moldings on Sport Coupe. $131.65, 37,773 built. This option could be added to any other option (i.e., SS or Z/28), making the model an RS/SS or a RS/Z28. The Z28 option was still available with the small block producing at 5800 rpm and of torque at 4200 rpm. It was backed by Muncie four-speed with a new-for-69 standard Hurst shifter and connected to a 12-bolt rear axle with standard 3.73 gears. The 302 featured 11:1 compression, forged pistons, forged steel crankshaft and connecting rods, solid lifter camshaft, and Holley carburetion on a dual-plane intake manifold. A dual four-barrel crossram intake manifold was available as a dealer-installed option. The 1969 model year was exceptionally long, extending into November 1969, due to manufacturing problem that delayed the introduction of the second generation model planned for 1970. It is a popular myth late-'69 Camaros were sold as 1970 models (due to GM publicity pictures of the '69 Camaro labeled as a 1970), but they were all assigned 1969 VIN codes.

Requests from dealers (notably Don Yenko) who were dealer-installing engines in the Camaro caused Chevrolet to use an ordering process usually used on fleet and special orders (taxis, trucks, etc.) to offer 427 engines in the Camaro. Two Central Office Production Orders (COPO), numbers 9560 and 9561, were offered in the 1969 model year. The COPO 9561 used the solid-lifter L72 big-block engine, making an underrated SAE gross at 5600 rpm and of torque at 4000 rpm. Yenko ordered 201 of these cars to create the now-legendary Yenko Camaro. Other dealers also became aware of the L72 engine package and ordered it. Around 1,000 Camaros were fitted with the L72 engine option.GM Tonawanda engine production datahttp://www.camaros.org/model.shtml The COPO 9560 used an all-aluminum big-block called the ZL-1 and was designed specifically for drag racing. The package was conceived by drag racer Dick Harrell, and ordered through Fred Gibb Chevrolet in La Harpe, IL, with the intention of entering NHRA Super Stock (drag racing). A total of 69 ZL-1 Camaros were produced. The engine alone cost over US$4,000‚Äîmore than the cost of a base V8 hardtop. Though rated at gross at 5200 rpm and of torque at 4400 rpm, the ZL-1 made SAE net in its \\"as installed\\" state. With exhaust changes and some tuning, the horsepower jumped to over 500. The ZL1 engines were hand assembled in a process that took 16 hours each, in a room that Corvette Chief Engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov described as \\"surgically clean.\\" All ZL1 engines were manufactured at the Tonawanda Assembly Plant before being installed in Corvettes and Camaros, or sold over the counter to racers.Auto Restorer, December 2000, pp.14-15. Two of the 69 ZL-1's are known to have landed in Australia, with both owned by local motor racing legend and multi-millionaire tyre retailer Bob Jane, with both cars painted in Jane's team colour Sebring Orange. One of the Camaros was used by Jane for drag racing in Australia (Jane also owned the Calder Park Raceway with the main straight doubling as one of the country's premier drag racing strips). Jane drove the other Camaro to win the 1971 and 1972 Australian Touring Car Championships (the forerunner to today's V8 Supercars), though due to regulation changes restricting engines to a maximum cubic capacity of 6000 cc, Jane was forced to replace the 427 engine with a 350 in 1972. The ATCC winner, which holds the record for the largest capacity car to ever win the championship since it began in 1960. As of 2016, Jane owns his ATCC winning ZL-1, which after its touring car life was sold and used as a Sports Sedan and a drag racer before Jane bought it back and had the car restored to its 1971 specification. Until his passing, Jane and the car continued to regularly appear at major historic meetings including the annual Australian Muscle Car Masters held each Father's Day at the Sydney Motorsport Park.The car is currently the subject of dispute over Jane‚Äôs estate. == First- generation engines == 427 aluminum engine 1968 SS 396 engine First generation engines include: * 1967‚Äì1969 L26 I6 * 1967‚Äì1969 L22 I6 at 4200 rpm, at 1600 rpm * 1967‚Äì1969 Z28 V8 (rated) actual * 1967‚Äì1969 LF7 V8 * 1967‚Äì1968: L30 V8 * 1969: L14 V8 200 hp (168 kW) * 1969: LM1 & L65 V8 and * 1967‚Äì1969 L48 SS V8 (1969 ) at 4800 rpm, at 3200 rpm * 1967‚Äì1969 L35 SS V8 at 4800 rpm, at 3200 rpm * 1968‚Äì1969 L34 SS V8 at 5200 rpm, at 3200 rpm * 1967‚Äì1969 L78 SS V8 at 5600 rpm, at 3600 rpm * 1968‚Äì1969 L89 aluminum cylinder head option for the L78 SS396/375 engine‚Äîlightened the engine by ~. * 1969 COPO 9561/L72 V8 at 5600 rpm, at 4000 rpm * 1969 COPO 9560/ZL-1 V8 at 5200 rpm, at 4400 rpm. == References == == External links == * Camaro Research Group - reference data for 1967-1969 Camaros * Camaro 1 Chevrolet Camaro 1 Chevrolet Camaro 1 Chevrolet Camaro 1 Chevrolet Camaro 1 Category:Cars introduced in 1966 ","title":"Chevrolet Camaro (first generation)"},{"id":"9131256","text":"Robert \\"Silyn\\" Roberts (28 March 1871 - 15 August 1930) was a Welsh clergyman, writer, teacher and pacifist. ==History== Roberts, a Calvinistic Methodist minister, was a noted Welsh-language poet, the winner of the Crown at the 1902 National Eisteddfod of Wales with his poem \\"Trystan ac Esyllt\\".

In 1892 he graduated from the ≈†iauliai Gymnasium. During 1892-1894, he studied physics and mathematics at Saint Petersburg University. Later he transferred to the study of law, graduating in 1898. As a student he began contributing to the newspapers Varpas (The Bell) and ≈™kininkas (The Farmer). From 1896 to 1898 he was a member of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania. After returning to Lithuania, he began practicing law and joined the 12 Apostles organization, dedicated to defending the right to use the Lithuanian language in print, which was banned at the time. In 1902 he participated in the creation of the Lithuanian Democratic Party. After the ban on Lithuanian language was lifted in 1904, Vilei≈°is obtained permission to publish the newspaper Lietuvos ≈™kininkas and was its editor-in-chief from 1905 to 1906. From 1907 to 1909, he served as the publisher of Vilniaus ≈æinios (Vilnius News) and, after it was banned, published and edited Lietuvos ≈Ωinios (Lithuanian News). He was one of the organizers of the Great Seimas of Vilnius in 1905, and an organizer of the Lithuanian Science Society in 1907. At the beginning of World War I, Vilei≈°is co-founded a Lithuanian organization aimed at helping war victims with agronomic and legal support, and became its chairman. He was also an active member of the Lithuanian Committee. Six schools were established by Vilei≈°is in the Alanta district. As a member of the Lithuanian Science Society he organized the publication of school textbooks. For distributing anti-German fliers among teachers, he was jailed in the Luki≈°kƒós Prison for six months and later to Germany for forced labor. In Berlin he managed to escape from prison, and he went into hiding until he was given permission to return to Lithuania. ==Political career== Jonas Vilei≈°is (seated, first from right) in the Fourth Cabinet of Ministers From 1917 to 1920, Vilei≈°is participated in the work of the Council of Lithuania. He was the only member to oppose the Declaration of Independence of December 11, 1917, in which Lithuania promised to be Germany's satellite. Vilei≈°is was one of the four members of the Council to resign on January 26, 1918, on the grounds that the Council of Lithuania had no right to usurp the rights of the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania, and that its authority only applied to the determination of Lithuania's future and model of the state. All twenty members of the Council voted on February 16 to the new edition brought by four members (Jonas Vilei≈°is, Mykolas Bir≈æi≈°ka, Steponas Kairys and Stanis≈Çaw Narutowicz), that returned with new edition of Act of Independence of Lithuania. A few days afterward, together with Justinas Staugaitis and Jurgis ≈†aulys, he left for Germany to seek recognition of Lithuanian independence. From 1917 to 1922 he was a member of the Lithuanian Popular Socialist Democratic Party; from 1922 to 1929 he was a member of the Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union. In 1929 he resigned the post of Chairman of the Central Committee and from the party. He was invited to serve in the First Cabinet of Lithuania, although he refused. On December 18, 1918, he became Minister of Internal Affairs in the Second Cabinet of Lithuania. While working as a minister he organized municipalities, appointed physicians to every county of Lithuania, and published laws governing cooperatives and army recruitment. Vilei≈°is resigned, along with the entire cabinet, on March 12, 1919. The Fourth Cabinet of Lithuania (June 12‚ÄìOctober 2, 1919) appointed Vilei≈°is Minister of Finance. He prepared a plan for Lithuanian currency reform, although it was not implemented. In 1919 he was sent as an ambassador to the United States, where he worked to obtain recognition of the state de jure and establish financial and trade relations. He also solicited donations from the Lithuanian-American community, collecting over 1.8 million US dollars; and more importantly, he managed to unite the Lithuanian diaspora. In 1922 he was elected to the First Lithuanian parliament (Seimas), and was a presidential candidate in the June 19, 1922 elections. ==Mayor of Kaunas== Statue of Jonas Vilei≈°is in Liberty Avenue, Kaunas. From September 30, 1921 until July 2, 1931, he served as mayor () of Kaunas, the temporary capital of Lithuania. Under his direction Kaunas grew rapidly and became a truly modern city. A water and wastewater system, costing over 15 million Lithuanian litas, was put in place; the city expanded from 18 square kilometers to 40; more than 2,500 buildings were built, including three modern bridges over the Neris and Nemunas rivers. All the city streets were paved, horse-drawn transportation was replaced with modern bus lines, new suburbs were planned and built, and new parks and squares were established. The foundations for a social security system were laid, three new schools were built, and new public libraries, including the Vincas Kudirka library, were established. Vilei≈°is maintained many contacts in other European cities, and as a result Kaunas was an active participant in European urban life. Vilei≈°is was also a professor at Vytautas Magnus University. On February 1, 1933, he was appointed to the State Council of Lithuania, and worked on the Civil Codecs of Lithuania. He died in 1942 at Red Cross Hospital in Kaunas, and is buried in Vilnius' Rasos cemetery in the Vilei≈°iai family chapel. ==Awards== *Order of Vytautas the Great 2nd grade, September 8, 1934. *Honorary member of Lithuanian Lawyers society. ==References== *\\"Vilei≈°is, Jonas\\".

He changed his shikona for the last time in January 1914, when he took the given name Kajir≈ç. Nishinoumi was awarded a yokozuna licence by the house of Yoshida Tsukasa in February 1916 after winning a championship at January 1916 tournament. He was 36 years old at the time of his promotion, making him the oldest wrestler to be promoted to yokozuna in the 20th century. In the top makuuchi division, he won 106 bouts and lost 38 bouts, recording a winning percentage of 73.6. He was the only wrestler to defeat Tachiyama between 1909 and 1916, his victory in January 1912 preventing Tachiyama from recording 100 straight wins (he had a winning streak of 43 before, and 56 after their bout). Tachiyama claimed many years later that Nishinoumi's win over him had been yaocho (fixed), but there is little evidence for this. He favoured the yokozuna dohy≈ç-iri (yokozuna ring- entering ceremony) style that has come to be known as Unry≈´ . After his retirement, he was an elder known as Izutsu and produced many top division wrestlers, such as yokozuna Nishinoumi Kajir≈ç III.

Black capitalism has traditionally focused on African-American businesses, although some critics and activists have also pushed for increased representation of Blacks in corporate America. ==Historical roots== Roots of black capitalism can be found in the lives of \\"Free Negroes\\" during times of the American Enslavement. Many records exist reporting the development of economic wealth by these \\"Free Negroes\\". The earliest recorded words touting the economic upliftment of African Americans by an African American was written by Lewis Woodson under the pen name \\"Augustine\\" in the Coloured American newspaper. Woodson helped found Wilberforce University and the first AME Theological seminary, Payne Theological Seminary and was an early teacher and mentor of Martin Delany. A prominent southern affluent black was A. G. Gaston who was, at times, instrumental in the civil rights movement. Galston was influenced by Booker T. Washington, who was an early leader at the Tuskegee Institute. Another wealthy African American was Robert Reed Church, who founded the nation's first black-owned bank, Solvent Savings, in 1906. There are many historical and current examples of neighborhoods of prominent and affluent blacks in American history. Some include the historical Highland Beach, Maryland and more recently Mount Airy in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Prince George's County, Maryland and DeKalb County, Georgia. Mainstream media identifies this with some interest. A more focused movement of black capitalism can be found in the popular magazine Black Enterprise. ==Strands of black capitalism== There are two strands of black capitalism: the one focuses on success as a group, while the other focuses on success as an individual. ===Group success=== One strain of black capitalism is immersed in the ethic of African Americans building wealth together, as exemplified in the Kwanzaa value of \\"ujamaa\\" meaning 'cooperative economics'. A prominent proponent and example of this cooperative economics is Russell Simmons who can be seen advocating the building of not only individual black businesses but communities of black businesses. Simmons has made the comment that black MBA students and graduates have the notion that they want to own their own businesses, not to simply be employed in someone else's business. A recent effort to standardize black capitalism as a movement was introduced in two books: Black Labor: White Wealth and the more recent book Powernomics by Dr Claud Anderson. In these two books Dr. Anderson outlines a schema on which black wealth can be coordinated and developed through a nine-issue plan. Some see this group success strain of black capitalism as a form of Social entrepreneurship which aims to build businesses that are oriented around providing services and goods that benefit the community in which they were built. Others see this as an outgrowth of the communal and tribal ethic attributed to traditional African cultures. Black Capitalism over the last thirty years has been driven to the forefront by entertainment. Yet the question as posed in an article on Huffington Post by Antonio Moore \\"The Decadent Veil: Black America's Wealth Illusion\\" questions are rising is this type of limited approach a help. \\"As black celebrity has been shown to millions of people, millions of times, the story of real lives has also been lost, and with it the engine that thrust forward the demand for social justice by the masses. The heartbeat of social action is to recognize your mistreatment, and demand better. With each presentation of Kobe Bryant's 25 million dollar a year contract, or Oprah's status as the sole African American billionaire a veil of false calm is created within the overall American economic psyche about the immense black wealth disparity.\\" ===Individual success=== A parallel, but possibly opposing, strain of black capitalism stems from the American ideal of building individual wealth. Prominent examples of this can be popular figures such as Oprah Winfrey and Robert L. Johnson. The complaint leveled against the adherents of individual success from advocates of group success is that individually wealthy African Americans have made millions of dollars and that that in and of itself has made very little contribution to the plight of African Americans in general. In general, African Americans and the media sometimes point to this phenomenon as \\"black flight\\" or \\"selling out\\" where affluent blacks move out of predominantly black neighborhoods into affluent white neighborhoods. A history of some of this is documented in the book Our Kind of People: Inside America's Black Upper Class by Otis Graham. ==Issues facing black capitalismAs distinct from racial integration=== The notion of racial integration is such that African Americans should be able to move and operate in a predominately white society safely. This effort at racial integration concerns mostly public spaces and private hiring practices. It is thought that attempts and movements supporting racial integration are efforts to enable blacks to assimilate into white institutions. Black capitalism is an effort to position blacks as the owners of land, the means of production, and businesses that own either or both. The aim of black capitalism is to bolster self-reliance, both individually and communally. ===Black anti-capitalism=== There are also two strands of thinking in African America, and specifically Black Nationalism, that is against capitalism as an economic system in all of its forms. One strand is against capitalism on the basis of the historical treatment of Africans and the African Diaspora, i.e. slavery, subjugation, and colonization. Another strand is against capitalism through strict political critiques, i.e. socialist. Many critics of capitalism from within the black community blend the two positions, however the reasoning behind them are distinct. A prominent black political critic was C. L. R. James. Two of the most popular black anti-capitalist books are How Europe Underdeveloped Africa by Walter Rodney and How Capitalism Underdeveloped Black America by Manning Marable. These books give analysis on how capitalism as an economic system has not raised the quality of living for the African Diaspora. ===Violence against black capitalism=== Examples of the explicit and public opposition to African American economic success have diminished since the Civil Rights Movement. However, before this period of American transition, there are a few notable violent attacks against prosperous African American communities including the Tulsa Race Riot and the Rosewood massacre. ===Economic disparity=== Blacks on average have a lower net worth than whites in America. This is especially pertinent in the creation of new businesses. One of the most common forms of collateral for loans to open businesses is home equity. With the historical and current differences in lending patterns toward blacks and whites, the option of using home equity to borrow against in order to open a business is diminished.

The word nachzehrer translates to \\"after (nach) living off (zehren)\\" likely alluding to their living after death or living off humans after death in addition to the choice of \\"nach\\" for \\"after\\" which is similar to \\"nacht\\" (\\"night\\"). The nachzehrer was prominent in the folklore of the northern regions of Germany, but even in Silesia and Bavaria, and the word was also used to describe a similar creature of the Kashubes of Northern Poland. ==Overview== A Nachzehrer is created most commonly after suicide, and sometimes from an accidental death. According to German lore, a person does not become a nachzehrer from being bitten or scratched; the transformation happens after death and is not communicable. Nachzehrers are also related to sickness and disease. If a large group of people died of the plague, the first person to have died is believed to be a nachzehrer. Typically, a nachzehrer devours its family members upon waking. It has also been said that they devour their own bodies, including their funeral shrouds, and the more of themselves they eat, the more of their family they physically drain. It is not unlikely that the idea of the dead eating themselves might have risen from bodies in open graves who had been partly eaten by scavengers like rats. The nachzehrer was similar to the Slavic vampire in that it was known to be a recently deceased person who returned from the grave to attack family and village acquaintances. It usually originated from an unusual death such as a person who died by suicide or accident. They were also associated with epidemic sickness, such as whenever a group of people died from the same disease, the person who died first was labeled to be the cause of the group's death. Another belief was that if a person's name was not removed from his burial clothing, that person would be a candidate for becoming a nachzehrer. Such a belief was found even in the Republic of Venice, where the body of a woman, with a brick in her mouth, was discovered in 2006 in a mass grave of plague-dead people.Nuzzolese, E., & Borrini, M. (2010). Forensic approach to an archaeological casework of ‚Äúvampire‚Äù skeletal remains in Venice: Odontological and anthropological prospectus. Journal of forensic sciences, 55(6), 1634-1637. The official killing myth says a nachzehrer can be killed by placing a coin in its mouth, and then chopping off its head. It can be discerned from this that a mere coin in the mouth may result in paralysis as some myths say that a stake through a vampire's heart does. Finding nachzehrer in order to kill them is not difficult; it is characteristic of a nachzehrer to lie in its grave with its thumb in its opposite hand, and its left eye open. Additionally, they are easily found while eating their burial shroud due to the noise they produce doing so.http://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends/nachzehrers-shroud- eating-vampires-germanic-folklore-006010?nopaging=1 ==See also== *Draugr (Norse mythology and Scandinavian folklore) *Revenant (English folklore) ==References== Category:Corporeal undead Category:German legendary creatures Category:Mythological hematophages Category:Shapeshifting Category:Vampires ","title":"Nachzehrer"},{"id":"9131440","text":"The Kerry Beagle () is one of the oldest Irish hound breeds, believed to be descendant from the Old Southern Hound or the Celtic Hounds.

The Kerry Beagle has a broad head, a short coat and long ears, black and tan is the more common colour but the coat may be tan and white, blue mottled and tan or black.

They require a lot of exercise, regular twice to three times daily walks and free runs. ==History & use== The Kerry Beagle is an ancient breed, believed to date back to the 16th century; detailed pedigrees date back as far as 1794. It is said that the ‚Äúgadhar,‚Äù a dog written about in ancient Irish texts, is a direct ancestor of the Kerry Beagle. Local legend has it that when Noah's ark came to rest against Galtymore, the highest peak in Tipperary, two black and tan hounds scented a fox and leapt off in pursuit, never to be seen again.Holland, p 129. By the 1800s the Kerry Beagle's numbers had dwindled in Ireland, with only one major pack maintained, the famous Scarteen of County Limerick belonging to the Ryan family, which still exists today.Alderton, p 86. Originally bred as staghounds, today they are used to hunt fox and hare and take part in drag hunting.Alderton, p 86. The Kerry Beagle was taken by many Irish immigrants to the Americas, and is considered a foundation breed in the development of the Coonhounds. == References Footnotes=Bibliography=== * Alderton, David, Hounds of the World, Swan Hill Press, Shrewsbury, 2000, . * Cunliffe, Juliette, The Encyclopedia of Dog Breeds Parragon, 2001, . * Fogle, Bruce, The Encyclopedia of the Dog, DK Publishing, New York, 2009, . * Hancock, David, Hounds: Hunting by Scent, The Crowood Press Ltd, Marlborough, 2014, . * Holland, Anne, Hunting: portrait, Little Brown, London, 2003, . ==External links== * Scarteen website Category:Dog breeds originating in Ireland ","title":"Kerry Beagle"},{"id":"9131453","text":"The executive departments of the government of Puerto Rico provide public services to the citizens of Puerto Rico.

Born in Savoy, he migrated to Spanish Louisiana in the late 1770s with brother Claude Fran√ßois [1752-1813) and brother-in-law Andre Quetand and was later joined by brother Jean Fran√ßois (1773-1850). He prospered as a commission merchant and owner of extensive property in New Orleans, especially in the American quarter. The war of 1812 severely limited his hopes for material growth of the city. He resigned office September 4, 1815 to salvage his waning personal finances. He never married and had no children. Nicolas Girod was of Protestant faith, in a predominantly Catholic city. He was the first regularly-elected mayor of New Orleans after Louisiana's admission to the Union. He was initially elected on September 21, 1812. Girod took office on November 5 of that year and served until September 4, 1814; at which date he was re-elected, resigning on September 4, 1815.Profile of Nicolas Girod, dated Oct. 7, 2002 at New Orleans Public Library website Girod was a member of a prominent family who owned considerable interests in shipping and mercantile enterprises. He was one of three brothers (Jean Francois and Claude Francois being the other two) with brother-in-law Andre Quetand who conducted commercial enterprises with area planters in what was known as the commission or factorage business. The Girods kept a wholesale and retail store in the vicinity of the levee landing, which in later years was transferred to the building at the corner of Chartres and St. Louis streets. He owned a large number of properties in the area of today's Central Business District, in the vicinity of Girod Street. New Orleans was full of excitement in the spring of 1821 when Girod remodeled and furnished the house on Chartres Street, that he inherited from Claude Francois Girod, in readiness for Napoleon Bonaparte. The ship Seraphine was being outfitted for a secret voyage by Commander Bossier and Dominique You, and Nicolas Girod was one of the sponsors of the plan to rescue Napoleon from his exile in Saint Helena; but Napoleon's death frustrated this plan. A residence was established for Napoleon at Chartres and St Louis streets by Nicholas Girod, and the ship \\"Seraphine\\" was built and equipped with the object of rescuing Napoleon from St. Helena. Under command of Capt. Bossier and Dominique You, the expedition set sail with this purpose, but returned when signalled by a French merchantman that Napoleon had died May 5, 1821. (Source: ART AND ARTIS'l'S IN NEW ORLEANS DURING THE LAST CENTURY BY ISAAC MONROE CLINE reprinted from blennialreport, Louisiana State Museum, 1922) Girod was quite a philanthropist. Among other provisions in his 1837 holographic will, he left a bon (obligation) of $100,000 to be applied to the construction of a facility in Orleans Parish for the housing and care of Louisiana's French orphans. Other institutions and individuals were recipients under this will, including Charity Hospital, $30,000. Nicolas Girod died on September 1, 1840, at his home located on the corner of Chartres and St. Louis streets. His former residence in the French Quarter is now known as the Napoleon House. Both New Orleans and Mandeville, Louisiana, have a Girod Street, named in Nicolas Girod's honor. ==See also== * Battle of New Orleans * Napoleon House * Girod Street Cemetery ==References== ==External links== * Girod administration at New Orleans Public Library website, transcription from a 1940 WPA compilation * Category:Mayors of New Orleans Category:1747 births Category:1840 deaths ","title":"Nicholas Girod"},{"id":"9131502","text":"Charles Bernard Jean Ghislain van de Werve (1740-1813), 2nd Count of Vorsselaer, Baron of Lichtaert and of Rielen, Lord of Giessen-Oudkerk, formed part of a very old, important and noble family of Antwerp.De Vegiano, Nobiliaire des Pays-Bas (1760), p. 547.

Typically the room is located in the basement (). In Finnish it's called pesutupa or pyykkitupa. ==Facilities== More than one washing machine is usually installed. They are often larger than private washing machines found in individual households, and more durable to withstand daily use. Drying facilities often include a tumble dryer or drying cabinet/drying cupboard (image) and a separate (warm-air assisted) drying room, where clothes are hung on washing lines. There may be one or more of each. A standalone centrifuge (or spinner) is often found, either if one or more washing machines don't have such a function or for residents washing garments by hand. It extracts the bulk of the water in minutes, minimizing the time subsequently needed in the dryer. Other facilities may include sinks for washing by hand, a mangle (wringer), a washboard, paper towel and trolleys (carts) for transporting laundry to the drying facilities. A tv√§ttstuga also has a social dimension - a place where conversation can arise between neighbours without discomfort. ==BookingSchedule=== Residents book the use of laundry facilities in advance, including: * Fixed periods: typically 2 or 3 per day - a.m./p.m. or morning/afternoon/evening. * Free booking: residents book any contiguous block of time during the hours of operation. The booking may apply to the entire laundry room or to a subset of the facilities (e.g. 1-2 machines and 1 dryer), depending on the cooperative's regulations. In many buildings the washing facilities are unusable at night. The main reason is to give residents living immediately above the laundry room a break from the noise of the machines (or their users). Impromptu use of the facilities during hours of operation is permitted when no booking exists, or by arrangement with the owner of the booking, or when the owner of the booking has obviously failed to turn up. ===Procedure=== Mechanisms for booking the facilities include: * Paper. Residents mark their booking on a chart. There may be formal or informal rules about the number of bookings allowed per month. * Locks. Slots in a board represent all bookable periods (typically with days numbered 1-31, cyclically allowing booking up to a month ahead). Each household has its own portable numbered lock which fits into any available slot, securing the booking. Only one booking per household is possible at any time. * Electronic, e.g. using a smart card or web browser. ==Financing== Unlike a commercial laundromat (laundrette), users do not pay per use. Maintenance and upgrade of the facilities is financed from the cooperative's funds, which mostly come from the general monthly fee paid by the households. Decisions on such expenditure are made by the cooperative's management. Consultation with the households (apartment owners) is only likely for larger investments. Some residents choose to install their own washing machine in their apartment instead of using the communal facilities. They will, however, continue to contribute to the financing of the communal facilities via the monthly fee. ==References== Category:Laundry places Category:Housing in Sweden ","title":"Tv√§ttstuga"},{"id":"9131583","text":"Stormblade is the second novel in the Heroes trilogy of the Dragonlance novels.

Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), was a landmark Supreme Court case that established the standard for determining when a criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel is violated by that counsel's inadequate performance. The Court, in a decision by Justice O'Connor, established a two- part test for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim: a criminal defendant must show two things: * Counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. * Counsel's performance gives rise to a reasonable probability that if counsel had performed adequately, the result would have been different. The decision was a compromise by the majority in which the varying \\"tests for ineffective performance of counsel\\" among the federal circuits and state supreme courts were forced into a singular middle ground test. State governments are free to create a test even more favorable to an appellant. ==Background== David Washington pled guilty in a Florida trial court to an indictment that included three capital murder charges. During the plea colloquy, Washington told the trial judge that although he had committed a string of burglaries, at the time of his criminal spree, he was under extreme stress caused by his inability to support his family. The trial judge told Washington that he had \\"a great deal of respect for people who are willing to step forward and admit their responsibility.\\" In preparing for the sentencing hearing, defense counsel spoke with Washington about his background but did not seek out character witnesses or request a psychiatric examination. The counsel's decision not to present evidence concerning Washington's character and emotional state reflected his judgment that it was advisable to rely on the plea colloquy for evidence as to such matters, thus preventing the state from cross-examining Washington and from presenting psychiatric evidence of its own. Counsel did not request a presentence report because it would have included Washington's criminal history and thereby would have undermined the claim of no significant prior criminal record. Finding numerous aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstance, the trial judge sentenced Washington to death on each of the murder counts. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed Washington's sentences on direct appeal. Washington then sought collateral relief in state court on the ground, inter alia, that counsel had rendered ineffective assistance at the sentencing proceeding in several respects, including his failure to request a psychiatric report, to investigate and present character witnesses, and to seek a presentence report. The trial court denied relief, and the Florida Supreme Court affirmed. Washington then filed a habeas corpus petition in Federal District Court advancing numerous grounds for relief, including the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. After an evidentiary hearing, he was denied relief, as it was concluded that although counsel made errors in judgment in failing to investigate mitigating evidence further than he did, no prejudice to Washington's sentence resulted from any such error in judgment. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in a three judge panel, determined that Washington had been ineffectively represented. However, the state of Florida appealed the decision, and the appeal occurred while the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit was statutorily created from a part of the Fifth Circuit. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit en banc, reversed the Fifth Circuit's ruling, stating that the Sixth Amendment accorded [466 U.S. 668, 669] criminal defendants a right to counsel rendering \\"reasonably effective assistance given the totality of the circumstances.\\" After outlining standards for judging whether a defense counsel fulfilled the duty to investigate nonstatutory mitigating circumstances and whether counsel's errors were sufficiently prejudicial to justify reversal, it remanded the case for application of the standards. The State of Florida appealed the decision to the United States Supreme Court, which granted certiorari. ==Decision== The Supreme Court began its decision with the idea that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel \\"exists, and is needed, in order to protect the fundamental right to a fair trial.\\" A fair trial is one in which \\"evidence subject to adversarial testing is presented to an impartial tribunal for resolution of issues defined in advance of the proceeding.\\" Criminal defendants require counsel's skill and knowledge in order to be able to successfully rebuff the state's attempt to imprison or execute them. Accordingly, the Court has ruled that counsel must be appointed for criminal defendants if they cannot afford to hire their own counsel. However, the fact that \\"a person who happens to be a lawyer is present at trial alongside the accused ... is not enough to satisfy the constitutional command.\\" Counsel must play the role in the adversarial system that allows the system to produce just results. Hence, the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel. A claim that counsel was ineffective, then, has two components, without which \\"it cannot be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable:\\" *Firstly, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was \\"deficient,\\" such that counsel's errors were \\"so serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\\" *Secondly, the deficient performance must be so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. In order to show that counsel's performance was \\"deficient,\\" the defendant must show that it fell below an \\"objective standard of reasonableness.\\" The legal profession is capable of maintaining standards that justify the law's presumption that counsel ordinarily serves his function in the adversary system. That includes such basic duties as assisting the defendant and showing him undivided loyalty by representing him unburdened by any conflict of interest. Counsel should advocate the defendant's case, consult with the defendant on the important decisions and keep him informed of important developments in the course of the prosecution. However, the basic duties do not serve as a \\"checklist\\" for counsel for \\"no particular set of detailed rules for counsel's conduct can satisfactorily take account of the variety of circumstances faced by defense counsel or the range of legitimate decisions regarding how best to represent a criminal defendant.\\" Counsel must have \\"wide latitude\\" to make \\"reasonable tactical decisions\\" lest the requirements for constitutionally effective assistance distract counsel from \\"the overriding mission of vigorous advocacy of the defendant's cause.\\" Judges who evaluate ineffective assistance claims should, in turn, be highly deferential to counsel's decisions and avoid scrutinizing them in hindsight. Harsh scrutiny would encourage the proliferation of ineffective assistance claims and \\"dampen the ardor and impair the independence of defense counsel.\\" Counsel does, however, have a duty to make \\"reasonable investigations, or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.\\" After all, strategic decisions made in light of a reasonable investigation and compared to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable. By contrast, strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable only to the extent that reasonable professional judgments justify the curtailment of counsel's investigation. The judgments may be informed by statements the defendant himself makes to counsel and the effects of previous strategic choices. However, not all errors on counsel's part justify setting aside the judgment; rather, they must prejudice the defendant's ability to receive a fair trial. In certain circumstances, such as when the defendant has had no counsel at all or when counsel has labored under a conflict of interest, the Court will presume prejudice, but ordinarily, the defendant must show that counsel's deficient performance had an adverse effect on the defense. Since the goal is to ensure that the defendant had a fair trial, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. The Court outlined several crucial guidelines to consider when applying the Strickland test: most importantly, the Court found that a \\"mechanical\\" application of the test was the wrong approach. A reasonable probability is one sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. When the defendant challenges his conviction, he must show that counsel's errors prevented the jury from forming a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. When he challenges a death sentence, as Washington is doing, he must show a reasonable probability that the sentencer would have balanced the aggravation and mitigation evidence differently. The assessments must be made, of course, with respect to the totality of the evidence presented at the hearing so that when the prosecution's case is weak, the defendant will more easily show prejudice. Applying the test to Washington's case, the Court concluded that counsel did not perform deficiently and that Washington suffered no prejudice. The counsel's decision to focus on remorse and emotional distress was a reasonable strategic decision in light of the trial judge's stated views on remorse, the heinousness of Washington's crimes, and Washington's own statements to counsel. In view of those considerations, the Court could not conclude that additional mitigating evidence would have given rise to a reasonable probability that the trial judge would have sentenced Washington to life in prison rather than death. The majority reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals. ===Concurring opinion=== Justice Brennan concurred in the result because he believed that the Court's new test for ineffective assistance, particularly the prejudice prong, would not impede the presentation of mitigating evidence on behalf of capital defendants: > Counsel's general duty to investigate ... takes on supreme importance to a > defendant in the context of developing mitigating evidence to present to a > judge or jury considering the sentence of death; claims of ineffective > assistance in the performance of that duty should therefore be considered > with commensurate care. However, because Justice Brennan believed that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment, he would have vacated Washington's death sentence and remanded for further proceedings. ===Dissenting opinion=== Justice Marshall dissented from the majority's holding. He objected that the Court's newly crafted test was unlikely to \\"improve the adjudication of Sixth Amendment claims.\\" He considered the performance standard \\"so malleable that, in practice, it will either have no grip at all or will yield excessive variation in the manner in which the Sixth Amendment is interpreted and applied by different courts.\\" What does \\"reasonable\\" mean? Should counsel's performance be judged by reference to a reasonable paid attorney or a reasonable appointed one? After all, Marshall pointed out, \\"a person of means, by selecting a lawyer and paying him enough to ensure he prepares thoroughly, usually can obtain better representation than that available to an indigent defendant, who must rely on appointed counsel, who, in turn, has limited time and resources to devote to a given case.\\" Marshall also disputed that counsel's performance must be given especially wide latitude, since \\"much of the work involved in preparing for trial, applying for bail, conferring with one's client, making timely objections to significant, arguably erroneous rulings of the trial judge, and filing a notice of appeal if there are colorable grounds therefor could profitably be made the subject of uniform standards.\\" Marshall also disputed that it should be made the defendant's burden to show prejudice from an allegedly incompetent attorney's performance. Prejudice cannot be measured solely with respect to the fairness of the outcome of the trial; the fairness of the procedure matters just as much. \\"The majority contends that the Sixth Amendment is not violated when a manifestly guilty defendant is convicted after a trial in which he was represented by a manifestly ineffective attorney. I cannot agree.\\" Marshall worried that the Court's admonition to future judges, presented with ineffective assistance claims should defer to counsel's strategic judgments, placed too heavy a burden on defendants making such claims. Finally, Marshall took issue with the Court's conclusion that the same standard for ineffectiveness should apply in a capital sentencing proceeding that applies at an ordinary trial. The capital sentencing process is intended to be especially reliable, and \\"reliability in the imposition of the death sentence can be approximated only if the sentencer is fully informed of all possible relevant information about the individual defendant whose fate it must determine.\\" The defendant's attorney is responsible for doing that. That and in light of the \\"severity and irrevocability of the sanction at stake,\\" the standard for effective assistance in capital sentencing proceedings must be especially stringent. Accordingly, Marshall believed that a person on death row seeking relief from his death sentence on grounds of ineffective assistance should not have to show a reasonable probability that he would not have received a death sentence if counsel had presented more mitigating evidence. Because it was clear that Washington's attorney had failed to investigate and then present large amounts of information to the sentencing judge, Marshall concluded that Washington's lawyer was ineffective. ==Subsequent events== Washington was executed on July 13, 1984, two months after the Supreme Court's decision. One of the important aspects of this decision was its relationship to United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984), and the number of appeals \\"held\\" by the Court in abeyance for the decision. Justice O'Connor's ability to gain a majority in this decision prevented the antiquated \\"farce and mockery standard,\\" a standard extremely difficult to achieve for an appellant, from making a return.

Additionally, the letter demanded that the fortress of Sveaborg must be defended to the bitter end and should withdrawing from the fortress be necessary then the bulk of the coastal fleet which had been docked at the fortress for the winter as well as all the supplies had to be destroyed by burning them down. == The siege == Russian forces under Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden laid siege to Sveaborg after the fall of Helsingfors on March 2, 1808. However the Russian force which had captured Helsingfors consisted only of roughly 2 000 men who had no chances in even just harassing the fortress. It took well into mid March before Russians had concentrated 4 000 men to area under General Jan Pieter van Suchtelen who started more effective sieging of Sveaborg by building first artillery batteries for the siege artillery in its vicinity. By early April Russians had amassed 6 500 men and 59 artillery pieces, some of which had been taken from Svartholm fortress after it surrendered, to besiege Sveaborg. Defenders at Sveaborg often fired at the Russian cossack patrols on the ice around the fortress, but without any practical results. Instead of attacking the numerically inferior besieger, the Swedes were content to stay behind their fortifications and prepare for the Russian assault by sawing a ditch to the open the ice around the fortress. The first Russian barrages were fired on 19 March and continued until 21 March, after which first attempts to negotiate were made. Cronstedt agreed not to fire at the town of Helsingfors in exchange for the Russians keeping their artillery batteries away from that direction. This suited the Russians since it allowed them to lodge their troops in Helsingfors without danger of being shot at by the Swedish artillery. On March 23 Cronstedt parleyed with Russian representatives on the island Lonnan, where Russians demanded the surrender of the fortress. After the Swedish refusal to comply, the Russians started another barrage against the fortress on 25 March which lasted until 1 April. The Russian surrender demand was repeated on 2 April. The Russians resorted to cunning psychological warfare to convince the officers in the fortress to surrender. Former Swedish subject Johan Samuel Hagelstr√∂m received special commendation from the Tsar for his actions in getting Sveaborg to surrender. Certain officers' wives who lived in Helsingfors and were allowed and encouraged by the Russians to visit the husbands in Sveaborg also played their parts. Perhaps the most important person in the Russian efforts to use cunning to force a surrender was the trusted advisor of Cronstedt, Colonel Fredrik Adolf J√§gerhorn. In the negotiations that continued on 2 April, Cronstedt suggested a truce at least until 13 May 1808. The Russians responded positively but demanded that the truce last only until 3 May and that meanwhile they would occupy several of the fortified small islands around the main fortress of Sveaborg. Discussing the matter with his officers, Cronstedt noted that according to his reckoning, the fortress had only enough ammunition left for two weeks and that men were getting sick. When asked about the fleet, Cronstedt refused to torch it, stating that it would be a disaster if the fortress survived and there were no fleet left. On April 6 Cronstedt agreed with Jan Pieter van Suchtelen, the Russian commander in Helsinki, on an honorable capitulation on May 3 if Swedish reinforcements didn't reach Sveaborg by then. The Swedish couriers bearing the requests for reinforcements were delayed by the Russians and didn't reach Stockholm until May 3, the same day Cronstedt capitulated and surrendered the fortress to the Russians, along with 7,500 soldiers and a fleet of 94 ships. Even if the couriers had arrived earlier, Sveaborg probably could not have been relieved by the fleet, as the winter was unusually cold and the Baltic sea was still partially frozen at the time. The fortress lost 6 men dead and 32 wounded as well as a couple of broken roofs and windows as the result of Russian actions in the siege. Cronstedt surrendered the fortress to the Russian army after a siege of two months. The fortress had internationally received the reputation of being \\"the Gibraltar of the North\\", and was by some assumed to be impregnable. In the peace treaty next year (1809), Sweden was forced to give up the territory of Finland (about half of the kingdom). In the search for scapegoats for the loss of Finland, the surrendering of Sveaborg became a convenient vehicle, and as Cronstedt was the responsible officer, he was charged with the whole catastrophe. === Suspected causes === Although many of the happenings are clear, some details still remain in darkness. One reason for the surrender is that the sea was frozen and the royal navy could not arrive. Furthermore, the messengers sent to Stockholm were delayed by the Russians and arrived too late. It is also disputed whether any troops would have arrived anyway, as Sweden had their troops tied up against their southern enemy Denmark and its mighty ally France. Cronstedt's failure to buy more time as well as the question why such a truce had been necessary in the first place remain at least partially obscure given Sveaborg's reputation of being the impregnable \\"Gibraltar of the north\\". Reasons: * Sveaborg is a bastion fortress, built on principles applied in Europe. This architectural type was considered as the world's most modern in those days. However, bastion fortresses were normally built in central Europe, where the land is flat. As the Finnish archipelago isn't flat at all (the height changes are huge) Sveaborg fit the location poorly. As the architecture of a bastion fortress relies on a symmetrical defense, Sveaborg had many weaknesses. The Gibraltar of the north was therefore hardly a justified name. * Although the Russian army was at first much smaller (2000 men, 60 cannons) than the forces at Sveaborg (6000 men, 734 cannons), more reinforcements arrived all the time. By the time of the negotiations, the Russian army was larger than the defending force. * The fortress had earlier received very poor funding. Since its completion in 1791, Sveaborg received no extra financial support from the government (the reason for that is still a mystery, but naturally related to the weak Swedish economic situation). The military equipment was in an unsatisfactory condition. Most of the supplies were of bad quality and the fortress lacked most supplies. * The cannons too, were old and partially obsolete. This meant that their range was shorter than that of the Russian artillery (which is a problem if cannons are stationed on a fortress). The fortress was unable to return fire on the Russian troops that were bombarding the fortress heavily. Furthermore, the fortress was lacking cannons; having not even half the number of cannons that were supposed to be on the fortress (almost 1600 cannons). * Cronstedt claimed that the fortress was short of gunpowder. This has been disputed by some historians as opinions diverge around what should have been sufficient daily battle usage of gunpowder. * The reason for the limited time of one month is that the negotiations were more or less dictated by the Russians. The Russian army was better supplied and had better artillery. The Russian army gave Sveaborg only one month to get reinforcements. * Sveaborg had never been fully completed. Only the fortifications on the islands had been constructed but none of the land-side defenses included in the original plans by Augustin Ehrensv√§rd were constructed. * Unwillingness by the Swedes to burn or shell the town of Helsingfors to the ground gained Russians a strong base of operations against the fortifications; doing so would have been according to some historians the best solution for preventing Russians from successfully besieging the fortress. === Unconfirmed theories === There are theories about the surrendering of Sveaborg that have never been confirmed or proven. Still, they continue to have support both among professionals and laymen. Despite the fact that the large picture is known, we should still consider the possibility of the following theories: * The war came as a surprise, and the 2000 civilians at Sveaborg were not evacuated in time. They were mostly families of the officers. It is possible that the commander, Cronstedt, wanted to save the lives of the women and children at Sveaborg. In those days fortress invasions were very bloody stories and no one was usually spared. * Cronstedt was even believed to have been bribed by the Russians. Despite recent research, this is still a popular theory today. During the Finnish war, two fortresses were located in south Finland: Sveaborg and Svartholm (located nearer to the Russian border). The commander of Svartholm, C.M. Gripenberg, surrendered the fortress almost immediately to the Russian army. Shortly afterwards he was employed by the Russian army. This was seen by many as bribery, as he was given a good position in the Russian army (it was very common for officers to change sides during this war). Therefore, Cronstedt was also a target for suspicions of bribery. However, the suspicions of Cronstedt's bribery have never been confirmed. It is true that he as well was given a pension (Cronstedt refused to join the Russian army and retired shortly after the war) by the Russian emperor, but the amount of money was normal and not much. There were no reports afterwards that Cronstedt amassed any great wealth. Further, Cronstedt continued after the war to carry his Swedish medals and wanted to defend his actions in front of a Swedish court himself, but was finally advised to stay in Finland. * It is believed that the Russian army was using war-psychology skillfully. Many of the officers' families were living in Helsinki and the Russian army was using their correspondence cunningly to convince the officers at Sveaborg that the Russian army was substantially larger than it was and that the whole kingdom of Sweden had been invaded. Many of the officers were pressuring Cronstedt to surrender. Afterwards Cronstedt was criticised for not reckoning the enemy force properly (the reason is still unknown). === Cultural impact === A short story \\"Under Siege\\" (published in Omni, October, 1985) by George R. R. Martin takes place during the siege of Sveaborg, as well as in a dire future. It is a reworking of an original story \\"The Fortress\\" written by Martin as a history paper for college. Both \\"The Fortress\\" and \\"Under Siege\\", in which time travellers from a dystopian future affect the outcome, can be found in Martin's collection of short stories Dreamsongs, published by Bantam. == Aftermath == The capture of Sveaborg helped the Russian conquest of Finland greatly, as it removed the threat of a counterattack from the south and west. To Sweden it was a devastating blow as it made the resupply of the battered Finnish army much more difficult. It was considered by many as one of the major reasons (if not the major reason) Finland was lost. Cronstedt was subsequently considered a traitor by many Swedes and Finns, notably Johan Ludvig Runeberg in his epic The Tales of Ensign St√•l. Among other things, Russia captured the bulk of the Swedish archipelago fleet. This included 3 hemmema and 7 turuma type archipelago frigates, 25 gun sloops, 51 gun yawls and various other ships. This had an immense effect on the war in the Finnish archipelago, especially since the chance of the Russian battle fleet successfully engaging the joint Swedish and British battle fleets in the open sea was marginal. Before the Russians were able to deploy their newly-captured fleet, an explosion happened at Sveaborg on 3 June 1808 which, together with the fire that broke out afterwards, caused considerable damage to the ships at Sveaborg, destroying among other things six of the seven captured turuma type archipelago frigates. == References == == Bibliography == * Nordling, Carl. \\"Capturing ‚ÄòThe Gibraltar of the North:‚ÄôHow Swedish Sveaborg was taken by the Russians in 1808.\\" Journal of Slavic Military Studies 17#4 (2004): 715-725. * Category:Battles of the Finnish War Sveaborg Category:1808 in Finland Sveaborg Category:Conflicts in 1808 Category:19th century in Helsinki ","title":"Siege of Sveaborg"},{"id":"9131667","text":"Ion Dragalina (16 December 1860 - 9 November 1916) was a Romanian general, who died during the World War I in the First Battle of the Jiu Valley. Dragalina was born in the city of Karansebesch (now Caransebe≈ü, Romania), which at the time was part of the Austrian Empire. Ioan Dragalina was a descendant of a military family. His father, Alexandru Dragalina, served as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army until his resignation in 1859. His parents moved to Romania, where his father was appointed administrator of the border region. However, Marta Lazaroni, his mother, wanted to give birth in her ancestral home and thus the family returned to Karansebesch, where in 1860 Ioan, the first of their four sons, was born. ==Education and early life== Ioan Dragalina went to primary school in Karansebesch and then to military school in Temesv√°r (Timi»ôoara). He continued his studies at the Military Academy in Vienna (1884) and joined the Austro-Hungarian Army. While at the Military Academy, he enrolled and graduated from the School of Geodetic Engineering. In 1886, he married Elena Giurginca. They had six children: two sons (Corneliu ‚Äì born in 1887, and Virgiliu ‚Äì born in 1890) and four daughters (Aurora, Elena, Cornelia and Viorica). Like his father, Dragalina graduated from the Wiener Neustadt Military Academy, where he specialized in geodetic engineering. Dragalina served as a lieutenant in the Line Regiment No. 43, which was headquartered in Kar√°nsebes. During the Hungarian parliamentary elections of 1884, two candidates were competing in Boks√°nb√°nya: the would-be Hungarian Prime Minister Istv√°n Tisza and the lawyer Coriolan Brediceanu of the Romanian National Party. Lieutenant Dragalina was in command of the troops assigned with maintaining order during the elections. Dragalina refused the instructions of the local civil authorities: to allow only the voters supporting the Hungarian candidate to pass. In response, Dragalina was publicly humiliated to the point of demanding satisfaction. Dragalina officially reported this to his superiors, and on 1 December 1887 he resigned from the Austro-Hungarian Army.Paul Miller, Claire Morelon, Berghahn Books, Nov 29, 2018, Embers of Empire: Continuity and Rupture in the Habsburg Successor States after 1918, pp. 143-144 ==Career in the Romanian Army== On 1 December 1887, Ioan Dragalina resigned from the Austro-Hungarian Army and moved to Romania where he joined the Romanian Army ten days later, retaining his rank of Lieutenant. Thanks to the skills and qualifications he had acquired in Austria-Hungary, Dragalina embarked upon a successful military career in Romania. As Captain Dragalina, he served under then-Colonel Constantin Prezan, a Romanian General during the First World War who eulogized him in 1936: \\"to his teachings I owe the tactics and strategy and all I knew and applied during the war and as Chief of the General Staff\\".Paul Miller, Claire Morelon, Berghahn Books, Nov 29, 2018, Embers of Empire: Continuity and Rupture in the Habsburg Successor States after 1918, p. 144 He advanced through the ranks becoming captain in 1892, major in 1899 and lieutenant- colonel in 1908. Between 1908 and 1911, lieutenant-colonel Dragalina was the commander of the Military Infantry School in Bucharest. For his work in developing the scientific curriculum and for the order and discipline instilled in the military education system, Ioan Dragalina was made a member of the Order of the Star of Romania, First class. In April 1911, colonel Ioan Dragalina took over the command of the 34th Regiment in Constan≈£a. During this time, he was made a member of the Order of the Crown, Fourth Class. In 1915 he was promoted to Brigadier General and had under his command the Third Territorial Commandment. During the years of Romania's neutrality, Dragalina worked on fortifications in the Prahova Valley. ==World War I== In 1916, prior to Romania entering the First World War on the side of the Allied Forces, Dragalina was named commander of the First Infantry Division, stationed at Drobeta-Turnu Severin. His troops patrolled a very large area on the western border, extending from the sources of the Arge≈ü River to the city of Calafat. ===Capture of Orsova=== The Romanian 1st Division - part of General Ioan Culcer's 1st Army - took the Austro-Hungarian town of Orsova (Or»ôova) in the Banat region on 4 September. The division was commanded by General Ioan Dragalina. The battle started on the morning of 28 August, with a bombardment of Turnu Severin by the √Ålmos. The monitor had left Orsova at dawn, shelling harbor facilities, the rail yards, a cavalry barracks and some shipyards at Turnu Severin, where Dragalina's division had its headquarters. The Austrian warship fired almost 500 artillery rounds of 75 mm, as well as considerable machine gun fire. Returning upstream to Orsova, √Ålmos couldn't overcome the current until her crew threw 25 tons of coal overboard. In retaliation, the Romanians under Dragalina put Orsova under artillery fire around noon on that day. Dragalina recognized the Alion Height, towering above the city on the east side of the Cerna's mouth, as the key to the Austrian position. The Romanians launched a full-scale assault on 1 September, their numbers enabling them to take the Alion Height by the end of the day. A simultaneous diversionary attack to the north on that same day enabled the Romanians to capture Meh√°dia (today Mehadia) and Herkulesf√ºrd≈ë (today BƒÉile Herculane). The Austro-Hungarians conducted a rear-guard action, but lost Orsova along with the west bank of the Cerna on 4 September, retreating north of Meh√°dia.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 20-21 ===First Battle of the Jiu Valley=== Lainici bridge In late October, a massive German and Austro- Hungarian offensive was launched in the Jiu Valley under the command of General . On 24 October 1916, General Dragalina was summoned to Craiova and ordered to take over the command of the First Army. He decided to fight Kneu√ül in the mountains and called upon his Romanian soldiers: \\"Officers and soldiers of the First Romanian Army, from this moment on I am at the helm of the army and demand from all of you, from General to the last soldier: first that you defend with your life the sacred ground of our fatherland, our ancestral home, our land and the honor of the Romanian name. I demand from all of you total discipline and the strictest execution of orders. The troop which cannot advance should die fighting.\\" Early on the morning of 25 October 1916 General Dragalina left by car for the Jiu Valley, accompanied by two officers ‚Äì Colonel Toma Dumitrescu and Major Constantin Militiade. He wanted personally to assess the situation on the front and reconnect with his military leaders, since phone lines were out of order. He reached the outposts of the first line of defense close to the Lainici Monastery. He stopped there to confess and take communion. While crossing the narrow Lainici bridge on his way back, the car was caught in machine gun cross fire. Speeding under a hail of bullets, his driver managed to cross the bridge, but the general was hit in his left upper arm and scapula. Dragalina was urgently transported to the medical outpost at Gura Sadului, where the wound was disinfected and his arm was bandaged. From Gura Sadului he was transported to T√¢rgu Jiu and that very same day to Craiova, where doctors recommended amputation. However, a telegram from Military Headquarters in Bucharest ordered his urgent transfer by train to the Military Hospital at the Royal Palace in Bucharest. The tedious and long trip delayed his arrival (the train arrived in Bucharest on the evening of 13 October) and his wound became infected. In Bucharest, doctors disinfected the wound, extracted the bullet from his scapula, and set his arm in a cast. His son, captain Corneliu Dragalina, himself wounded on the Dobruja front, came back to be at his bedside. On his hospital bed, King Ferdinand I of Romania conferred upon him the Order of Michael the Brave. On 16 October 1916 his left arm was amputated. His condition began to ameliorate, but then sepsis set in. He died on the evening of 9 November 1916.John Buchan, T. Nelson, 1922, A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres, p. 248 Memorial services were held at Biserica AlbƒÉ in Bucharest. In attendance were King Ferdinand and Prince Carol (the future King Carol II) as well as many political personalities: Ion I.C. BrƒÉtianu (Prime-Minister of Romania), VintilƒÉ BrƒÉtianu (War Minister), the writer Barbu ≈ûtefƒÉnescu- Delavrancea, Mihai Cantacuzino (Justice Minister), Take Ionescu (Minister of Foreign Affairs), Henry Catargi (Marshal of the Royal Palace), generals and foreign military attach√©s in Romania. He was laid to rest in the Heroes' Cemetery (Bellu Military Cemetery) in Bucharest. ==Legacy== Site where Dragalina was wounded Scott #7303) Although he was in command of the 1st Army for only one day (24-25 October 1916), it is General Dragalina who is credited with the Romanian success at the Jiu Valley, the most conspicuous Romanian victory of the 1916 campaign, given that it was achieved against forces superior in both numbers and artillery. Dragalina had inferior numbers and no reserves, but addressed the issue of his numerically inferior forces by borrowing detachments from two nearby groups. Although he was wounded in action and replaced as commander of the 1st Army on 25 October, his dispositions - made with great tactical skill - ensured the success of the Romanian counterattack which began on 27 October, and lasted as late as 1 November.John Buchan, T. Nelson, 1922, A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres, p. 248Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 172 As a tribute to his heroism, several monuments were erected. Among these: * A memorial in the Jiu gorge near the spot where General Dragalina was wounded, erected on 12 October 1927. * A bronze statue was placed in front of the military barracks, in the Park General Ioan Dragalina in Caransebe»ô. The statue is the work of Mihai Onofrei and was unveiled on 3 June 1943.

A commemorative plaque was placed on the wall of the house of General Dragalina in Caransebe»ô (Ardealului Street, No. 6). Many streets, schools, and geographical places were also named after him. To honor his memory, a village in the CƒÉlƒÉra»ôi County was named Dragalina in 1924. In 2017, Po»ôta Rom√¢nƒÉ issued a 3.50 lei stamp in his honor, part of the \\"Eternal Glory to the First World War Heroes\\" series, which also includes Generals David Praporgescu and Radu R.

The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community Board 8. Named after Van Cortlandt Park, it is bordered by the Major Deegan Expressway to the west, the Jerome Park Reservoir to the east, West 238th Street to the south, and Van Cortlandt Park to the north. Its ZIP Code is 10463. ==History== The arrival of the elevated IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line subway line around the turn of the 20th century brought an influx of immigrants to Kingsbridge Heights, including the section of the neighborhood that would eventually become known as Van Cortlandt Village. The Amalgamated Cooperative Houses, because of its distinctive culture and high population density, came to define its corner of Kingsbridge Heights as a distinct area, according to Lloyd Ultan, the Bronx Borough Historian. In 1975, a member of the local community board proposed that the Amalgamated and its surroundings be renamed, and a sign was unveiled designating the area Van Cortlandt Village. ===Naming for preservation=== The Historic Districts Council in early January 2012 recognized Van Cortlandt Village as a New York City neighborhood in need of preservation. In Van Cortlandt Village, the Fort Independence Park Neighborhood Association has been fighting a handful of land grabs and new housing projects. The community sits atop the ruins of a Revolutionary War fort and was designed by legendary landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. It boasts small Tudor revival homes and during the 1920s became a mecca for socialist factory workers fleeing the tenements of the lower East Side to build cooperative housing. Now that former co-ops such as the Shalom Aleichem Houses have fallen on hard times and the character of the neighborhood is threatened by overdevelopment, HDC will help FIPNA get it listed on the national historic register, according to Kristin Hart, president of the community group. Originally named \\"Yiddish Cooperative Heimgesellschaft\\", the historic Shalom Aleichem Houses cooperative housing project was started by socialist Yiddish members of the Socialist and Communist Parties. Construction on the 15-building Neo-Tudor fortress-like structure culminated in 1927. . The multi-ethnic rental complex is located in what is considered to be the heart of the Van Cortlandt Village community. As part of the Office of the Bronx Borough President's Bronx 2008 historic preservation project, the Shalom Aleichem Co-operative complex is being reviewed for landmark status. The community, eventually named for legendary Yiddish author Shalom Aleichem, was founded as one of the country's first housing cooperatives. It failed during the Great Depression and became a rental complex. But the close-knit community produced a generation of successful scientists and artists, and was a virtual neighborhood within a neighborhood. Shalom Aleichem's garden courtyard is still lush and beautiful, tended by its diverse, working class tenants. The complex went through difficult times but in the spring of 2013 was acquired by an owner who has been restoring it to its original grandeur and has proudly renamed the complex, and it is now called the Shalom Aleichem Houses. ==Demographics== Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Van Cortlandt Village was 50,100, a decrease of 507 (1.0%) from the 50,607 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012. Accessed June 16, 2016. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 12.1% (6,087) White, 17.0% (8,498) African American, 0.2% (93) Native American, 4.8% (2,386) Asian, 0.0% (7) Pacific Islander, 0.5% (259) from other races, and 1.0% (479) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 64.5% (32,291) of the population.Table PL-P3A NTA: Total Population by Mutually Exclusive Race and Hispanic Origin - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, March 29, 2011. Accessed June 14, 2016. ==Land use and terrain== Van Cortlandt Village has traditionally been classified as part of Kingsbridge, and in particular, as part of the northern section of Kingsbridge Heights. The neighborhood is generally thought to extend from its namesake Van Cortlandt Park on the north, to Dickinson and Sedgwick Avenues on the east, to Bailey Avenue on the west and Albany Crescent on the south. ===Residential=== Van Cortlandt Village is a mostly low density residential neighborhood. On September 28, 2004, the New York City Department of City Planning approved the rezoning all or portions of 15 blocks in this northwestern Bronx neighborhood (bounded by Van Cortlandt Park South to the north, Fort Independence Park and Sedgwick Avenue to the east, West 231st Street and Albany Crescent to the south, and by Heath Avenue, Fort Independence Street and Orloff Avenue to the west) into Van Cortlandt Village, which is located within Community District 8.The zoning changes aimed to preserve the community's low-rise/low-density character by ensuring that new development is compatible in scale, both with the one- and two-family detached homes that prevail in parts of the neighborhood and with the more diverse housing stock in others. The area is predominantly low-density residential, with a significant number of one- and two-family detached and semi-detached houses. Even the multifamily apartment buildings in the area are seldom taller than . Its housing stock is diverse, including spacious single- family homes, multiple-family attached homes and postwar co-op buildings. The New York Times describes the area as a \\"serene enclave of quaint homes, winding streets and abundant trees.\\" The area is described by Anthony Perez Cassino, a former chairman of Bronx Community Board 8 who helped to rezone the neighborhood, as a \\"vulnerable\\" area, owing to the fact that it is more affordable than nearby Riverdale. A garland of greenery wends through the neighborhood. In the heart of the area, on twisting hilly streets like Giles Place and Cannon Place, are elegant brick homes with porticos and manicured hedges. Along the broader avenues are handsome co-op buildings, capped on the northern end by the Amalgamated Cooperative Houses, one of the city's historically significant co-op complexes. With nearly 1,500 units in 11 buildings, the complex was founded in 1927 by leaders of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union, who fashioned it as a sort of proletarian paradise. While some of the descendants of the mostly Jewish immigrants who made up the Amalgamated's original tenants remain, a more diverse collection of residents carry on its legacy, with communal enterprises like children's play groups and art classes. As elsewhere in the city, street parking is scarce and some co- ops have resident parking lots. ===Commercial=== Shopping in the neighborhood is limited to a small but serviceable collection of retailers at the northern end of Sedgwick Avenue. Close nearby, to the west and southwest of Van Cortlandt Village, two new large commercial shopping malls were constructed and opened in 2014. The first to open in July 2014 is Riverdale Crossing located at West 237th Street and Broadway, and the second one, opened in fall 2014, is the Broadway Plaza mall located at West 230th Street/Kimberly Place and Broadway. ===Parks=== Van Cortlandt Park The neighborhood abuts Van Cortlandt Park, a swath of forest with various trails and recreational fields. It is the city's fourth-largest park and includes the Van Cortlandt Golf Course. Stretching along part of Sedgwick Avenue is Fort Independence Park, a popular neighborhood spot with handball courts, a basketball court and a playground. The Jerome Park Reservoir offers a walking-jogging scenic pathway. ==Social and civic groups== The Amalgamated Co-op offers various social activities: ceramics classes, writers' workshops and art exhibits. Many of the Bronx's cultural amenities are a short distance away, including the New York Botanical Garden and Wave Hill. The Van Cortlandt Jewish & Senior Centers (JASA) are also located on Sedgwick Avenue. ==Police and crime== Van Cortlandt Village is patrolled by the 50th Precinct of the NYPD, located at 3450 Kingsbridge Avenue. The 50th Precinct ranked 13th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. The 50th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 81.5% between 1990 and 2018. The precinct reported 7 murders, 15 rapes, 110 robberies, 147 felony assaults, 105 burglaries, 458 grand larcenies, and 97 grand larcenies auto in 2018. ==Fire safety== Van Cortlandt Village contains a New York City Fire Department (FDNY) fire station, Engine Co. 81/Ladder Co. 46, at 3025 Bailey Avenue. ==EducationSchools=== PS 95 on Hillman Avenue serves grades K-8. The Am Park Neighborhood School serves grades PK-5. The Bronx High School of Science (75 West 205th Street) is about from Van Cortlandt Village. DeWitt Clinton High School, is also located nearby on West Mosholu Parkway. There are various parochial and private schools in the area, including the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, Horace Mann School, Riverdale Country School and SAR Academy in Riverdale. Manhattan College, a small institution of higher education, is a small Catholic university with a renowned undergraduate engineering school is located nearby. Lehman College, a senior college that is part of the City University of New York (CUNY), is directly across the Jerome Park Reservoir. ===Library=== Van Cortlandt Library The New York Public Library (NYPL) operates the Van Cortlandt branch at 3882 Cannon Place. The two-story, branch opened in 2019, replacing a smaller one- story branch a few blocks away, which opened in 1969 and consisted of a single room. ==Transportation== There are no New York City Subway stations in the neighborhood. The nearest subway stations are the , which serve 242nd Street, 238th Street, and 231st Street on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line. Other stations include Mosholu Parkway and Bedford Park Boulevard‚ÄìLehman College, serving the on the IRT Jerome Avenue Line, and Bedford Park Boulevard, serving the on the IND Concourse Line. The following MTA Regional Bus Operations bus routes serve Van Cortlandt Village: *Bx1: to Riverdale or Third Avenue ‚Äì 138th Street station (via Grand Concourse) *Bx2: to Kingsbridge Heights or Third Avenue ‚Äì 138th Street station (via Grand Concourse) *Bx3: to Kingsbridge Heights or Columbia University Medical Center in Washington Heights, Manhattan *Bx10: to Riverdale or Norwood ‚Äì 205th Street (via Kappock Street and West 231st Street) *BxM3: to Yonkers or Madison Square Park The nearby Major Deegan Expressway (Interstate 87) and Henry Hudson Parkway offer a relatively quick route to Upper Manhattan as well as to Bergen County, New Jersey via the George Washington Bridge. Mosholu Parkway leads to Southern Boulevard and the New York Botanical Garden. In addition, the nearby Saw Mill Parkway also offers local access to places in Westchester. ==References== ==Further reading== *Van Cortlandt Village in Forgotten NY *\\"At Bess Myerson‚Äôs Former Home, Shades of a Bronx Utopia.\\" New York Times, January 12, 2015 Category:Neighborhoods in the Bronx Category:Kingsbridge Heights, Bronx ","title":"Van Cortlandt Village"},{"id":"9131689","text":"Horror-of-personality is a specific sub-category of horror and thriller genres; as opposed to excessive violence or the presence of malevolent supernatural beings, such stories evoke horror and/or suspense through villains who are perfectly human, but possess horrific personalities.Dead Ringers, A Gender and Genre Analysis: Horror of Personality They usually focus on Freudian psychology, as well as the cause and effect of profound insanity.

Over the next dozen years, Copeland's romance novels achieved much success, as was evidenced by her winning the Romantic Times Reviewer's Choice Award, The Holt Medallion, and Waldenbooks' Best Seller award. Despite her success in more mainstream romantic fiction, in 1995, Copeland decided to switch focus. Her subsequent books have been in the relatively new subgenre of Christian romance. She has also collaborated with author Angela Elwell Hunt on a series of Christian romance novels. Copeland has been inducted into the Missouri Writers Hall of Fame. She and her husband of over forty years, Lance, live in Springfield, Missouri. They have three grown sons.

They were chieftains to Kakatiyas and Kalyani Chalukyas and ruled over the Nellore region. ==History== These Chodas claimed their descent from the famous Karikala Chola. They ruled over their kingdom consisting of the Nellore, Cuddapah, Chittoor and Chengalput districts with Vikramasimhapuri (modern Nellore) as their capital. Chola Bijjana was the first important chief in the Nellore Choda clan. As a feudatory of Someswara I of Western Chalukyas, he took part in the wars of the Chalukyas and Later Cholas. In recognition of the loyalty and services of his descendants to the Chalukyas of Kalyani, Vikramadiya II appointed them as rulers of Pakanadu. Later Tikka (1223‚Äì1248), the father of the famous Manumasiddhi, extended his kingdom to as far south as the river Kaveri. He owed nominal allegiance to the already crippled Later Cholas. Along with the Hoysala Vira Narasimha, he helped the Later Cholas ruler Rajaraja Chola III in restoring him back to his throne by repulsing the attacks of Aniyanka Bhima, Kopperunchinga II and the Pandyas. Subsequently, when the Hoyasala Vira Narasimha's successor Somesvara, desirous of making the Later Chola ruler a puppet in his hands, joined hands with the Pandyas and attacked Rajendra III, Choda TiKka came to the rescue of the Chola emperor. He defeated both the Hoyasala and the Pandyan forces and got thereby the Tondaimandalam region for himself. He even assumed the title Cholasthapanacharya. During the reign of Tikka's son and successor Manumasiddhi II (1248‚Äì1263), the power of the Nellore Cholas was at its low ebb. About the year 1260, a dangerous feud broke out between Manumasiddhi and Katamaraju, the chief of Erragaddapadu in Kanigiri region. The feud was on the issue of the rights of the two princes to use certain wide meadows as grazing grounds for their flocks of cattle. It led to the fierce engagement of the two sides and the bloody battle was fought at Panchalingala on the Paleru river. Manumasiddhi's forces led by Khadga Tikkana, the cousin of poet Tikkana won the battle, but the leader perished. This feud and the consequent battle formed the theme of the popular ballad entitled \\"Katamaraju Katha\\". Shortly after this disastrous battle, Manumasiddhi died. With the death of Manumasiddhi II, the Nellore kingdom lost its individuality, became a battle ground between the Kakatiyas and the Pandyas and changed hands frequently. In the reign of Kakatiya Prataparudra II, the Nellore region became part and parcel of the Kakatiya empire and lost its political significance. ==Administration== ==Culture== ==Religion== The region during this period witnessed both Saivism and Vaishnavism. ==Society== ==Literature== The period of rule of the Telugu Chodas was in particular significant for the development it received in the Telugu literature under the patronage of the rulers. It was the age in which the great Telugu poets Tikkana, Ketana and Marana enriched the literature with their remarkable contributions. Tikkana Somayaji was a minister of Manumasiddhi II of Nellore. This great poet had for his credit two important works in Telugu. The first one is Nirvachanottara Ramayanamu. Though a highly Sanskritised style was employed, it is characterised by excellent literary qualities and abounding elements of Pathos and heroism. However it is the Andhra Mahabharata which brought for Tikkana undying fame and made him one of the immortals. Though it is a translation of the last fifteen volumes of the Mahabharata, left out by his predecessor Nannaya, yet Tikkana put life and blood into it with an avowed objective of making it an epic. His delineation of character, dramatic dialogue and lucid and at the same time suggestive exposition of facts are masterly in nature. His broad spiritual outlook, lofty idealism, high imagination and splendid diction made him Kavi Brahma (The Supreme Creator among poets). Ketana, respected as Abhinava Dandi, a contemporary of Tikkana, dedicated his Dasakumaracharitramu, written in tasteful and sweet style, to him. He also translated Vijnaneswara's Mitakshari, a Sanskrit commentary on the Yajnavalkya Smriti, into Telugu under the name Vijnaneswaramu. Another work of Ketana is Andhra Bhashabhushanamu, a book, on metrical grammar in Telugu. Marana was another contemporary of Tikkana, He was also a disciple of the latter. He translated the Markandeya Purana into Telugu. His work became a source book to many subsequent Telugu poets who selected their themes from the many delightful stories incorporated in it. ==Architecture== ==See also== *Epic of Katamaraju ==References== * Durga Prasad, History of the Andhras up to 1565 A.

They were members of the Professional Football League of America (PFLA) in 1967 and, after the leagues merged, the Continental Football League (COFL) during the league's last two years (1968‚Äì1969). The club was owned by Marty O'Connor and initially coached by Don Branby. == 1968 season == After spending three seasons with the Montreal Allouettes of the Canadian Football League, former Arlington High School and Northern Illinois University Huskies star George Bork returned to Chicagoland as the Owls' starting quarterback for their inaugural season in 1968. The new club raised some eyebrows when they announced they would play in Soldier Field, which had been unused by pro football since the Cardinals moved out in 1959 (the Owls' tenancy on the lakefront preceded the NFL's Bears by three years). Offensive lineman Bob Kuechenberg, younger brother of Bears linebacker Rudy Kuechenberg, began his professional career with the Owls; the younger Kuechenberg would go on to a 14-year career with the Miami Dolphins. Chicago Owls ticket envelopeAfter dropping four of their first five games, the Owls fired Branby and replaced him with Bob Webb, who was also the Owls' back-up quarterback. Webb led Chicago to a 5-2 record the rest of the year, enough to even up the Owls' record at 6-6, third place in the Central Division. Playing primarily on Saturdays, the club drew only 35,835 fans to cavernous Soldier Field all season, or less than 6,000 a game. == 1969 season == Things did not improve for the Owls in 1969, as their record slipped to 5-7 and continued to draw small crowds: just 21,403 paid their way to their games this season, barely 3,500 a contest and a small fraction of their stadium's capacity. The team was practically invisible amid the crowded Windy City sports scene, with a running gag in the Chicago press that mentions of the Chicago Owls brought a response similar to an owl's hoot: \\"Who?\\" The CoFL revoked their franchise on December 15, 1969 for failing to meet the league's financial obligation. Despite this setback, the Trans-American Football League announced it would include the Chicago Owls on its schedule for 1970, but the team folded prior to the start of the 1970 season. ==References== Category:Continental Football League teams Owls Category:Soldier Field Category:1968 establishments in Illinois Category:American football teams established in 1968 Category:Sports clubs disestablished in 1969 Category:1969 disestablishments in Illinois ","title":"Chicago Owls"},{"id":"9131888","text":"The F.

Not to be discouraged, Girardi persevered and contacted several NHL teams for a tryout. The New York Rangers took a second look at Girardi and invited him to their training camp in the 2005‚Äì06 season. He eventually signed a free agent, two-way American Hockey League (AHL) contract with the Hartford Wolf Pack, the Rangers' AHL affiliate, and began the 2005‚Äì06 season with the Charlotte Checkers of the ECHL. Eventually, Girardi was called up to the AHL's Wolf Pack and while there, was signed to an NHL deal by the Rangers. Girardi was called up by the New York Rangers on January 27, 2007, after an injury to Rangers defenceman Darius Kasparaitis, and made his NHL debut that night in a 2‚Äì1 win over the Philadelphia Flyers. Girardi remained in the NHL for the remainder of the season, playing in 34 games and recording 6 assists.

During the 2010‚Äì11 season, Girardi led the NHL in blocked shots, with 236. For the 2011‚Äì12 season, Girardi was named an interim alternate captain for the Rangers while Marc Staal was recovering from post-concussion syndrome. In Staal's absence, Girardi led all NHL skaters in average ice-time, averaging nearly 28 minutes per game. His play earned him a spot in the 2012 NHL All-Star Game. Girardi scored his first playoff goal on April 26, 2012, against the Ottawa Senators during Game 7 of the 2012 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. During the 2012‚Äì13 lockout-shortened season, Girardi was named an interim alternate captain for the Rangers a second time while Marc Staal was recovering from an injury sustained on March 3 when he was hit with a puck in the eye. During the 2013‚Äì14 season, on February 28, Girardi signed a six-year, $33 million extension with the Rangers. He was named an alternate captain for the Rangers for the remainder of the season when captain Ryan Callahan was traded at the NHL trade deadline to the Tampa Bay Lightning. Girardi's solid defensive play in the playoffs was a key part in the Rangers' run to the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost to the Los Angeles Kings. Girardi became a permanent alternate captain during the 2014‚Äì15 season, and spent most of the season on the Rangers' top defensive pairing with captain Ryan McDonagh. Girardi's solid defensive play that season led to the Rangers winning the Presidents' Trophy, as well as a run to the Eastern Conference Final, where the Rangers lost to the Tampa Bay Lightning in a hard-fought, 7-game series. Girardi started the 2015‚Äì16 season strong, contributing to a 14‚Äì2‚Äì2 start to the 2015‚Äì16 season for the Rangers. Midway through the season, however, the Rangers slumped, going 4‚Äì7‚Äì2 in the month of December, with many critics blaming Girardi for the slump. Even though the Rangers seemed to play better by February, Girardi suffered a knee injury late in the season, and the team started to fall apart, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round of the playoffs in five games, despite many expecting the Rangers to make another deep playoff run.

In game 4 of the second round in the 2018 NHL playoffs, Girardi scored an overtime goal to give the Lightning the win and a 3‚Äì1 series lead over the Boston Bruins. Giradi announced his retirement from hockey on September 20, 2019.

The site consists of a Woodland period village site inhabited from roughly 450 to 650 A.D.; five burial mounds are also associated with the site. The site's upland location is uncommon for village sites from the period, which have mostly been located in river valleys. The location may have been affected by the development of plant cultivation at the time, and extensive seed deposits at the site provide insight into developing agricultural practices. In addition, preserved remnants of woven artifacts have been found at the site; such items are rare and may help explain how weaving developed during the period.Maruszak, Kathleen.

Cris is creative through appealing to the senses, physically giving people some salt or water if that's what he's talking about, or cooking a bacon sandwich while talking about the food laws of Leviticus. \\"Jesus had illustrations right there where they were touchable. Yet when we preach so often we simply show a photo or describe a situation. What if we did what Jesus did and actually had the thing that was the illustration there for them to touch smell or taste?\\" Rogers has also been a monthly theology writer for YouthWork Magazine, writing for youth workers to understand the background to the books of the Bible. ===Author=== In January 2004, Kevin Mayhew Publishing published Rogers' first book, Naked Christianity: Helping young people grasp issues of faith.

Based on traditional fiqh, and referenced in the Qur'an and hadith, khul' allows a woman to initiate a divorce. ==Origins in textsQur'an=== From the \\"Sahih International\\" translation of the Qur'an. > Divorce is twice. Then, either keep [her] in an acceptable manner or release > [her] with good treatment. And it is not lawful for you to take anything of > what you have given them unless both fear that they will not be able to keep > [within] the limits of Allah. But if you fear that they will not keep > [within] the limits of Allah, then there is no blame upon either of them > concerning that by which she ransoms herself. These are the limits of Allah, > so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah‚Äîit > is those who are the wrongdoers. :‚Äî 2:229 > And if a woman fears from her husband contempt or evasion, there is no sin > upon them if they make terms of settlement between them‚Äîand settlement is > best. And present in [human] souls is stinginess. But if you do good and > fear Allah‚Äîthen indeed Allah is ever Acquainted, with what you do. :‚Äî 4:128 > : ===Hadith=== The most well known story that references khul' and serves as the basis for legal interpretations is the story of Jamilah, the wife of Thabit ibn Qays:Macfarlane, 2012, p. 34 Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: The wife of Thabit bin Qais came to the Prophet and said, \\"O Allah's Apostle! I do not blame Thabit for defects in his character or his religion, but I, being a Muslim, dislike to behave in un-Islamic manner if I remain with him.\\" On that Allah's Apostle said to her, \\"Will you give back the garden which your husband has given you as Mahr?\\" She said, \\"Yes.\\" Then the Prophet ordered to Thabit, \\"O Thabit! Accept your garden, and divorce her once.\\" ==Related issuesCompensation=== Most Islamic schools of law agree that the husband is not entitled to more than the initial amount of dower (mahr) given to the wife. However, some interpretations suggest that the husband is entitled a greater compensation, while other interpretations suggest that the husband is not entitled to any compensation.Engineer, 1992, p. 137-138 According to some interpretations, khul ø demands that the mahr already paid be returned along with any wedding gifts. Many imams interpret this law only to apply if there is no fault on the husband. Men sometimes prefer and pressure their wives to demand a khul ø instead of the husband pronouncing a talaq so that the husband can demand the return of the mahr. Another scenario that rarely arises in khul ø is that the husband will request an unreasonable financial compensation. This can effectively constrain her from seeking khul ø because they have no means to support themselves financially with the loss of their mahr and other wedding ‚Äúgifts.‚ÄùMacfarlane,2012, 195-6. ===Consent of the husband=== In regard to the consent of the husband, most schools agree that husband's agreement is a basic procedure and essential to the granting of divorce, unless extenuating circumstances apply. While this is the prevailing interpretation, other interpretations suggest that the husband does not have to consent if the grounds of divorce are valid, such as cruelty (darar) or impotence (if undisclosed to bride at time of marriage). In addition, if a husband cannot provide his wife with basic marital obligations, such as shelter or maintenance, a woman may be granted khul ø.Engineer, 1992, p. 137-138 If the woman is underage, then consent must be given from the guardian of her property.Nasir, 2009, p. 131 The laws of khul ø in particular cannot be found in the Qur'an directly, so a Sharia court judge must discern from Hadith and Islamic jurisprudence historical cases what they believe to be valid reasons for divorce.Macfarlane, 2012, p. 168-9. ===Role of the Court=== Views on role of the court and judge varies across schools, depending on whether or not the divorce is considered a type of talaq (husband's repudiation of the marriage) or judicial annulment. If the husband does not consent to the divorce, a woman often goes to a mediating third party, such as an imam. Only a person versed in Islamic law i.e. a qadi, or Islamic Sharia court judge, can grant the khul ø without the husband's consent. When petition for khul ø is taken to the Sharia courts, a judge is permitted to substitute the husband and annul the marriage. This process of judicial annulment is also commonly referred to as faskh, which typically occurs when the husband refuses to consent to the wife's decision to divorce.Tucker 2008, p.97-99 ===Iddah=== When a woman is granted a divorce through khul ø, she must enter a waiting period known as iddah. According to the majority opinion, which includes the reliable position in the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i and Hanbali schools, the waiting period for khul' is the same as the waiting period for divorce, and a minority opinion limits it to a single period . If a woman has already gone through menopause, she must wait three calendar months. The waiting period for a woman who has irregular periods is dependent on different interpretations. If a woman is pregnant or becomes pregnant during the waiting period, she must observe the waiting period until laying her burden.Tucker 2008, p. 100-101. ===Custody=== Custody over children tends to favor the mother if she has not remarried, but the father is still expected to provide childcare, unless the wife is able to take on the expenses herself. Once a child is old enough, he or she is given the choice to decide who has custody.Welchman, 1998, p. 121 ==Interpretations by regionEgypt=== A form of khul ø was adopted by Egypt in 2000, allowing a Muslim woman to divorce her husband. As a condition of the divorce, the woman renounces any financial claim on the husband and any entitlement to the matrimonial home.\\"Egypt Divorce Rates Hit New High with 'Khula' Law\\". Al Arabiya News. December 4, 2012. In Egypt, it is very difficult for a woman to be granted khul ø. In the first two years after khul ø was adopted 5,000 cases were brought before Egyptian courts. Of the 5,000 cases, only 122 were approved. Although difficult to obtain, many believe that the implementation of khul ø in Egypt is a milestone for Islamic activists.Hamada 2010, The Hard Way Out, Divorce By Khula. The Islamic khul ø procedure has also been used by some Egyptian Christian women to obtain a no-fault divorce, and it is considered by some as an opportunity for their empowerment vis-√†-vis patriarchical institutions. ===Iraq=== Iraq is unique in that it is stated in the law that infidelity constitutes as a valid reason for divorce. In addition, a woman is allowed to seek khul ø if her husband is infertile and they do not have children.Welchman 1998, p. 109. When a woman is granted khul ø, compensation can be greater or less than the dower.Nasir 2009, p. 131 ===Jordan, Morocco, and Syria=== In Morocco, if a woman is coerced or harassed by her husband, the husband has no entitlement to compensation. In Morocco, Syria, and Jordan, compensation other than money can include child care or custody. In Jordan, a new law has been recently passed that allows a woman to end her marriage by using the principle of khul ø itself. Within the first two years of passing this law, the courts saw an exponential increase in khul ø lawsuits. The law has yet to be approved by parliament, however, and it is still condemned by many lawyers to this day.Nasir 2009, pp. 131‚Äì134 ===Nigeria=== Khul ø is the most common form of divorce in Northern Nigeria. If a woman can provide enough compensation on her own or with the help of family, it is likely that she will be able to get out of an unhappy marriage.Nasir 2009, p. 130. ===North America=== According to a ten-year study from 1992 to 2002 conducted by Dr Ilyas Ba-Yunus, the overall divorce rate amongst Muslims in North America was at 32% which was significantly lower than the 51% rate for the general population.Macfarlane 2012, Islamic Divorce in North America, 142. Further, In North America, a 2009 a study conducted for SoundVision, an Islamic foundation, concluded that 64% of Islamic divorces are initiated by women.Macfarlane, 167. Imams in North America have adopted multiple approaches towards Khul ø. One of the biggest issues that cause imams to differ in their views is whether or not the women should return the mahr to the husband. Another important issue for women in North America is getting both a civil decree and religious divorce. Religious divorce is sought out as \\"a meaningful personal and spiritual process\\" that is attained in addition to (not as a substitute) to a civil decree. Another important issue that arises in North America is that many women are unaware of their Islamic right to seek khul ø. Some North American women even caution that being assertive and knowledgeable of Islamic law in front of their imam may even be detrimental to them. Women have said that the imams appeared to be \\"less sympathetic\\" because they saw the women as challengers to their authority.Macfarlane, 175‚Äì176. ===Pakistan=== According to the \\"Dissolution of Muslim Marriage Act\\" passed in 1939, judicial Khula was allowed to be authorized without the husband's consent if the wife was agreed to forfeit her financial rights.Barrister Tasheen Butt and Associates, Laws of Pakistan Relating to Marriage, Divorce, Custody and Maintenance Marriage is not considered a sacrament among Muslims but rather a civil contract with \\"spiritual and moral\\" undertones. Therefore, legally, the marriage can be dissolved for \\"good cause.\\" The wife has the right to have the marriage dissolved on the grounds of Khula if she decides she cannot live with her husband. In Pakistan there are two different classes of Khula. The first (i) is by mutual agreement; and the (ii) By order of the court Qadi and dissolution of marriage taking place by the husband's pronouncing talaq in the first class of cases and by the order of the Qadi or the court in the second class of cases. The Qur'an declares ‚ÄúWomen have rights against men similar to those them.\\"'Kakhakel 2008, The Law of Divorce in Pakistan The wife alone wishes to divorce her husband; and there are two ways for her to achieve this divorce or 'khula' (i) She requests her husband that she no longer wishes to remain in marriage with him; and the husband declares a divorce upon her. (ii) If her husband is not willing to grant her a divorce, the wife is well within her rights in Shariah to approach a Shariah Court and present her divorce case to the Shariah Judge. The Judge would then summon the husband and ask him to declare a divorce upon his wife and free her from the marriage. If the husband for any reason refuses, the Sharia Judge has the right to declare a divorce between the husband and the wife in marriage. ===Saudi Arabia=== Women awarded khul ø in Saudi Arabia are required to financially compensate their husbands or give away marriage settlements. Sometimes, this may include custody rights to their children. Other than the dowry, it is also common for the wife, especially in the case of newlyweds, to return marriage expenses. Older females in Saudi Arabia generally do not support khul ø. They believe that the increased number of khul ø requests is the result of Western influences of Saudi culture. Mainly, the new belief that women should also pursue financial aspirations. In Saudi Arabia, women can end up losing when awarded khul ø. This is because often they cannot support themselves or their children.Hamada, 2010, The Hard Way Out: Divorce by Khula ===Yemen=== In Yemen, khul ø is recognized as a judicially supervised annulment. Alcoholism, jail time of more than three years, impotence, mental feebleness, and hatred constitute as valid reasons for a woman to seek khul ø. While domestic violence is not always constituted as valid, it is against the law in Yemen for husbands to physically or psychologically harm their wives.Amanat, Abbas and Frank Griffel 2009, p. 175. ==References== ==Further reading== * Amanat, Abbas and Frank Griffel (2009).

The feast of Our Lady of Confidence falls on the last Saturday prior to Lent. Pope Gregory XVI granted a Canonical Coronation to the image on 14 October 1838, via Cardinal Carlo Odescalchi, at the requested petition of the Roman seminarians. In addition, Pope Pius X was particularly devoted to Mary under this title. ==History== There are two different traditions associated with the painting. One holds that it was painted by a religious sister in the eighteenth century. The other states that it was painted by Carlo Maratta, who gave it to a young noblewoman who later became Abbess of the Convent of the Poor Clares in Todi, Italy.\\"Who is the Madonna della Fiducia (or Confidence)?\\", Marian Library, University of Dayton ==Devotion== Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title \\"Our Lady of Confidence\\" can be traced back to Sr. Chiara Isabella Fornari, who was a Poor Clare in Todi, Italy. The image is especially noteworthy in that Christ points to his mother, and Mary's intercession is typically invoked through the short prayer \\"Mater Mea, Fiducia Mea\\" (My Mother, My Confidence). ==Rome's Pontifical Major Seminary== Originally, this Madonna was located at the Jesuit Collegio Romano, where it is believed she protected the seminarians from the Asiatic flu epidemic of 1837, which claimed many lives in Rome. To repay her, the seminarians crowned both Mother and Child with golden bejeweled diadems. The Patroness of Rome's Major Seminary is the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title Madonna della Fiducia. A miraculous copy of Our Lady of Confidence now resides at the Roman Major Seminary located in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran complex. Pope John Paul II started the papal tradition of venerating this miraculous image each year; subsequently, Pope Benedict XVI carried on the tradition. During his visit on the feast day of Our Lady of Confidence on 9 February 2002, Pope John Paul II ended his time at the seminary commenting on the devotion his predecessors had to Mary as Madonna della Fiducia, saying, > We heard how Our Lady of Confidence guided the steps of Pope John XXIII on a > path that brought him from this Seminary to the Second Vatican Council, > which was also a great seminary, the seminary of the bishops of the world. > Let us thank Our Lady of Confidence for all that she did to assist Pope John > XXIII in the preparation for and in the adventure of the Second Vatican > Council.

The magazine was launched in 1980 after Lesser (then 27 years old with no editing experience) was a guest editor of Ron Nowicki's San Francisco Review of Books. She found the experience so rewarding that she decided to create her own publication, and the first issue of The Threepenny Review appeared three months later.Guthmann, Edward. \\"Threepenny Review marks 25 years of doggedly panning for literary gold,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, January 7, 2005.

Tancheng is the southernmost county-level division of Shandong Province and borders Jiangsu. It is about 90 kilometres (by road) south of Linyi City and 400 kilometres southeast of Jinan, the capital city of Shandong Province. Tancheng is the ‚ÄúHometown of Chinese Ginkgo‚Äù and ‚ÄúHometown of Chinese Tamarix‚Äù. The population in 2011 was 970,000. The land area of the county is about 1,306.58 square kilometres. It is a developing city in a rural area. Tancheng is famous for its ginkgo trees.Forestry Economics, Volumes 1-3, China National Forestry Economics and Development Research Center, 1996 ==Visit by Confucius== A visit by Confucius to Tancheng had been kept alive in local memory. A temple and shrines marked the locations where Confucius was said to have been. The episode is described in the ancient Tso-chuan commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals, a classic text of China. It apparently tells of the journey by Confucius circa 524 B.C. from his home in Lu to the then state of T'an, to consult and study with the Viscount of T'an, also called T'an- tzu.Jonathan D. Spence, The Death of Woman Wang (New York: Viking Press, 1978), pp. 17-18 (his visit to T'an-tzu), also re Confucius and Tancheng at pp. 15-16. Reprints by Penguin, 1980, 2005.Cf., Liu Wu-Chi, Confucius, his Life and Time (New York: Philosophical Library 1955), pp. 42-43: K'ung Ch'iu (Confucius) meets with the viscount of T'an in the autumn of 525 B.C. ==17th century life== Tancheng in the 17th century is the setting for Jonathan Spence's microhistory, The Death of Woman Wang (1978). Spence draws on two Tancheng sources: the Local History of T'an-ch'eng (1673), edited by Feng K'o-st'an; and, \\"a personal memoir and handbook on the office of magistrate compiled in the 1690s by the scholar-official Huang Liu-hung\\". Spence also employed the 'strange stories', the sad tales and essays of author P'u Sung- ling (1640-1715), \\"who lived a little to the north in Tzu-ch'uan county, separated from T'an-ch'eng by a range of bandit-infested hills\\".Spence (1978), pp. xii & 2 (Feng), xiii & 9 (Huang), xiv & 19 (P'u), quotes at xiii and xiv. Cf. p.141 (the three sources). Feng K'o-st'an arrived in Tancheng from Fukien in 1668 as the new magistrate. A few months later the Great Tancheng earthquake of 1668 with strength M8¬Ω, the largest seismic event ever recorded in history in eastern China, hit the county.Zhou, C., Diao, G., Geng, J. et al. Fault plane parameters of Tancheng M8¬Ω earthquake on the basis of present- day seismological data. Earthq Sci 23, 567‚Äì576 (2010). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11589-010-0756-0 Although Feng was a \\"chin-shih\\", an 'advanced scholar', his experiences in Tancheng were not fortunate, being dismissed from office in 1670. His Local History recorded Tancheng \\"suffering for fifty years\\" from the 1622 White Lotus uprisings,Cf., C. K. Yang, \\"Religion and Political Rebellion\\" [1961], in Schurmann and Schell, editors, Imperial China (New York: Random House 1967; reprint Vintage), pp. 166-177. In Shandong province, famines due to \\"frequent rain failure\\" gave rise to 'White Lotus' rebellions (p.174, quote). In Chinese history 'White Lotus' was a common name (from Buddhism) for politico-religious uprisings, e.g., against Mongol rule (p.166). In the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th centuries there were conflicts involving 'White Lotus' groups (pp. 168, 170, 172, 174). and from drought, locusts, famine, sickness, and assorted banditry. People hurt, and despaired. In 1643 \\"Manchu troops under General Abatai\\" invaded Tancheng and \\"killed tens of thousands\\". The Ming dynasty collapsed in 1644.Spence (1978). Feng's career: pp. 2-3; Feng's Local History pp. 3-9, quotes at 4 & 6-7, grim folk sayings at pp. 4-5. Huang Liu-hung arrived from Honan in 1670 as the next magistrate; also a scholar, it was his first posting. The people of Tancheng told him that the region had for many years been \\"destitute and ravaged\\". He found the people struggling for bare survival. They were also \\"unusually superstitious\\". It was very difficult to raise moral. The social fabric had begun to fray. To counter the \\"decades of catastrophes\\", Huang attempted to grant generous \\"tax concessions\\" and \\"corv√©e labor rebates\\", but adequate approval by the Peking government was not forthcoming.Spence (1978). Huang: pp. 9-19, quotes at 9 & 15, scholar of Honan [Henan] at 13, \\"raising moral\\" at 14, social fabric at 18-19, Huang's attempted generosity at 13-14 (quotes).

It was completed in 2009 and cost $105 million to build. It replaced the Toledo Sports Arena, which has since been demolished. It serves as the home of the Toledo Walleye ECHL ice hockey team, and was the home of the Toledo Crush of the Legends Football League for the 2014 season. ==History== After a successful partnership on the Mud Hens Stadium (Fifth Third Field), the Lucas County Commissioners teamed with HNTB Architecture Inc., a national sports architecture firm located in Kansas City; The Collaborative Inc., of Toledo; and Poggemeyer Design Group, of Toledo, for a new arena. The arena was designed as the first new LEED sports arena in the United States. The arena's signature green design element is a \\"green wall\\" outside of the building, to feature the use of plant life on the exterior of the building to help cool the arena by shading the glass-enclosed main entrance of the arena. The arena's location near mass transit systems, use of a light-colored roof membrane to reflect heat and sunlight, and underground cisterns collecting rain water to re-use for landscaping purposes around the arena, are also emphasized to earn LEED points for the project. The Huntington Center opened in 2009. ==Notable events== The Huntington Center was formerly known as the Lucas County Arena The arena is part of a complex that includes SeaGate Convention Centre and Fifth Third Field. The first person to perform at this venue was Jeff Dunham. Other performances that have happened at the Huntington Center include: Janet Jackson, Daughtry, Tool, Lil' Wayne, Rascal Flatts, Carrie Underwood, Elton John, Brad Paisley, Stevie Nicks, Kid Rock, Jason Aldean, Hunter Hayes, and Bob Seger. It is also the Toledo-area stop for World Wrestling Entertainment. Huntington Bancshares Incorporated bought the naming rights to Lucas County Arena in April 2010 and renamed it as the Huntington Center.

He played in the Danish heavy metal band Mercyful Fate from 1981 to 1985 and from 1992 to 1993, and its successor project King Diamond from 1985 to 1987. He played with his fingers rather than with a guitar pick. Many have asked about how Hansen acquired \\"Grabber\\" as a nickname. Timi apparently used to play a Gibson G3 Grabber. A music store clerk began to call him \\"Grabber\\" and the name stuck. Aware that the meaning might be misunderstood, he slowly changed his stage name, Timi Grabber, back to his real name, Timi Hansen. ==Personal life== On 1 August 2019, King Diamond announced that Mercyful Fate would play on Copenhell and some tour concerts, but Hansen would not attend and was replaced by Joey Vera. He explained through Livia Zita's account that he was fighting cancer.

It was originally published in Cemetery Dance and was later collected in Nightmares & Dreamscapes. == Publication history == Stephen King had been a regular reader of Cemetery Dance, a horror magazine, and sent an unsolicited short story to be published there in 1992. The resulting publicity helped to raise their profile. == Plot summary == In the story, salesman Bill Hogan notices an odd pair of walking \\"Chattery Teeth\\" (odd due to their unusually large size and the fact that they are made of metal) in a convenience store display. The clerk ends up giving Hogan the teeth, claiming they had been dropped and no longer work. Hogan is unable to dismiss another oddity- his sense that the teeth are somehow sentient and want to kill him. As he leaves the convenience store, Hogan reluctantly (having been robbed by a hitchhiker once before) gives a ride to a hitchhiker outside the convenience store; his fears prove prophetic when the young man tries to carjack him and then kill him. During the struggle, Hogan wrecks the van, and before the hitchhiker can recover and kill him, the teeth come to life and gruesomely dispatch the criminal. Hogan passes out to the vision of the Chattery Teeth dragging the hitchhiker's body off into the desert. Nine months later, Hogan stops again at the same convenience store, where he is unexpectedly reunited with the \\"broken\\" teeth again. The store owner's wife recounts how a disheleved young man- Hogan's would-be carjacker and murderer- was found dead out in the desert, presumably killed by wild animals. Hogan realizes the teeth likely never intended to kill him, but instead want to protect him. Mrs. Scooter gives him the teeth again. His theory is proved correct when a dog snarls at him as he leaves and the teeth stir in his pocket, ready to attack anything that means him harm. Hogan resolves to keep the teeth permanently, and to eventually pass them on to his son. == Reception == George Beahm called it \\"quintessential King\\" and \\"a horrific little gem of a story\\". Wiater et al. called it \\"a bizarre tale\\" and said that it is reminiscent of \\"The Monkey\\", a story collected earlier in Skeleton Crew. == Adaptations == The short story was turned into a segment in the television movie Quicksilver Highway. The audiobook version was narrated by actress Kathy Bates. == References == == See also == * Stephen King short fiction bibliography Category:Short stories by Stephen King Category:Short stories adapted into films Category:1992 short stories Category:Works originally published in American magazines ","title":"Chattery Teeth (short story)"},{"id":"9132216","text":"Robert Charles \\"Rob\\" Byrnes, Jr. is a 21st-century gay American, novelist and blogger, whose fiction focuses primarily on gay men and other sexual minorities.

He sold the operation in 1886 to businessmen Joseph Huey (1827‚Äì1904), James Garitty (1842‚Äì1925), and J. E. Whiteselle (1851‚Äì1915), who named it the Corsicana Manufacturing Company. In 1898, the cotton gin manufacturing division (formerly Winship Manufacturing Company and later Corsicana Manufacturing Company) was sold to Continental Gin Company,History of Oil City Iron Works, The Navarrow County Scroll: http://www.txgenweb6.org/txnavarro/business/oil_city_iron_works/history_of_oil_city_iron_works.htm and the factory was leased to William Clarkson (1858‚Äì1941), a South Carolina native who came to Texas after the Civil War. After the sale of the manufacturing division the company functioned as a repair specialist for cotton gins and oil mills in East Central Texas. Clarkson renamed the company the Oil City Iron Works, because the area was then in the midst of an oil boom. He bought the company in 1908 and became president after it was incorporated in 1921. In addition to parts for cotton gins, the plant began making castings for the oil and building industries. It was converted to defense production during World War II (1941‚Äì45). After the war the cotton industry in Navarro County declined and Oil City Iron Works diversified its operation to provide castings for the oil field, road building, farm machinery, and other industries.

The one-off documentary followed Justin Lee Collins as he entered the world of celebrity lookalikes and attempted to become one himself before visiting a convention for them. The show returned on 17 January 2008 for a series with Justin Lee Collins this time crashing three conventions, each on magic, ventriloquism and clowning. ==EpisodesSeries 1=== Celebrity Impersonator Aired: 26 January 2007, 10pm Collins, who hails from Bristol, England, admitted in the documentary that he had always secretly harbored the ambition to be a singer. This project, employing the talents of his UK production company film crew, brought him the opportunity to transform himself into a celebrity impersonator for one of the premiere showcase events of the industry, the Sunburst Convention of Celebrity Impersonators. The convention, produced annually in Orlando, Florida by producers and performers Gregory & Jackie Thompson , provides both seasoned professionals as well as interested newcomers to the business an opportunity to showcase their unique acts before a substantial group of talent agents and buyers. Collins began his pursuit of the project by seeking the advice of a number of UK-based professionals, including the producers of the Legends tribute show on Blackpool's Central Pier, and with the direction of music industry experts, he settled on Tom Jones as his chosen alter ego. Upon arriving in America at the Convention, a nervous Justin chatted with various impressive celebrity lookalikes before bravely performing on stage himself as the Welsh legend. Amazingly, after Collins' performance of Delilah and It's Not Unusual, the agents and judges were sufficiently impressed to offer him bookings. The programme was completed with Collins appearing on the Legends stage at Blackpool to a capacity crowd. ===Series 2=== Magician Aired: 17 January 2008, 10pm In the first episode Justin was to crash a Magic Convention in Canton, Ohio and take part in The Battle of Magicians for a cash prize. Justin only had four weeks to decide what magic tricks he would like to perform within his 10-minute slot and to learn how to perform them. On the day he performed at the convention as Justin Illusion and came 3rd overall winning a cash prize of $150. The episode attracted 1.1 million viewers and a 6% audience share.Tv ratings, 18 January: Positive verdict for ITV1 crime drama  Media  guardian.co.uk Ventriloquist Aired: 24 January 2008, 10pm The second episode saw Justin crashing a ventriloquism convention, eventually taking part in an open mic slot in front of an audience of fellow ventriloquists, an industry agent and a panel of judges. Again, Justin only had four weeks to select a puppet, prepare a routine and test it out on some of the UK's most established expert ventriloquists (such as Keith Harris and Paul Zerdin), before heading off to Kentucky to perform at the largest ventriloquist convention in the world - the VentHaven Ventriloquist Convention. This episode attracted the same number of viewers as the previous (1.1 million), this time giving it a higher audience share of 7%.TV ratings - 24 January: Cutting Edge return watched by 2.7 m  Media  guardian.co.uk Clown Aired: 31 January 2008, 10pm The third episode in the series saw Justin travelling to a Clowning Convention in Houston, Texas where he would compete for the prize of Clown of the Year. Justin got some tips on clowning with the UK's best clown, Mooky The Clown, at the Tower Circus in Blackpool, England and came up with the clowning alter ego of Wonky, having to shave off his beard in the process. Once at the convention he had to compete in the clown equivalent of the Olympic Games where he was judged on Costume and Make-up, Balloon Modelling, Paradability and finally perform a Solo Skit in front of a panel of judges. Being disappointed by the poor quality of the competition, Collins felt he had a chance of winning the main prize, but his Solo Skit was disqualified for running over time and involving a member of the audience (thus making it technically not a \\"solo\\" performance). He did however win a bronze medal in the Costume and Make-up category.

It is run on the New Course at Cheltenham over a distance of about 3 miles (2 miles 7 furlongs and 213 yards, or 4,822 metres), and during its running there are twelve hurdles to be jumped. The race is scheduled to take place each year in January. The race was first run in 1983 over a distance of 2 miles 5 furlongs and 110 yards. In the late 1980s the event was classed at Listed level, and its full title was the Bishops Cleeve Hurdle. It was promoted to Grade 1 status in 1991, and in the following years its title was shortened to the present form. It was downgraded to Grade 2 status in 2004, and its distance was extended to the present length in 2005. In its analysis of that year's running, the Racing Post commented that the modified Cleeve Hurdle was \\"effectively replacing the long-distance hurdle formerly run at Haydock on Peter Marsh day.\\" The race is now a leading trial for the Stayers' Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival. ==Winners== { class = \\"sortable\\"  border=\\"1\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\\" - bgcolor=\\"#77dd77\\" align=\\"center\\" ! width=\\"36px\\"  Year ! width=\\"160px\\"  Winner ! width=\\"40px\\"  Age ! width=\\"180px\\"  Jockey ! width=\\"180px\\"  Trainer - 1983Al Kuwait7John FrancomeFred Winter - 1984Buckbe5Colin BrownDavid Elsworth - 1985Rose Ravine6R PuseyFulke Walwyn - 1986Stans Pride9Ronnie BegganG Price -bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" 1987Abandoned because of frost -  1988  Cloughtaney  7  Tony Mullins  Paddy Mullins -  1989  Calapaez  5  Simon Sherwood  Brooke Sanders -  1990  Beech Road  8  Richard Guest  Toby Balding -  1991  Crystal Spirit  4  Jimmy Frost  Ian Balding -bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" 1992 Abandoned because of frost -  1993  Muse  6  Paul Holley  David Elsworth -  1994  Flakey Dove  8  Richard Dunwoody  Richard Price -  1995  Mudahim  9  Norman Williamson  Chris Broad - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" -bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" 1996 Abandoned because of frost -  1997  Large Action  9  Jamie Osborne  Oliver Sherwood -  1998  Mistinguett  6  Carl Llewellyn  Nigel Twiston-Davies -  1999  Lady Rebecca  7  Norman Williamson  Venetia Williams -  2000  Lady Rebecca  8  Norman Williamson  Venetia Williams -  2001  Lady Rebecca  9  Norman Williamson  Venetia Williams -  2002  Kates Charm  9  Mick Fitzgerald  Robert Alner -  2003  Classified  7  Tony McCoy  Martin Pipe -  2004  Crystal d'Ainay  5  Jimmy McCarthy  Alan King -  2005  Patriarch Express  8  Jim Culloty  Sue Smith -  2006  Fire Dragon  5  Tony McCoy  Jonjo O'Neill -  2007  Blazing Bailey  5  Robert Thornton  Alan King -  2008  Inglis Drever  9  Richard Johnson  Howard Johnson -  2009  Big Buck's  6  Ruby Walsh  Paul Nicholls -  2010  Tidal Bay  9  Brian Hughes  Howard Johnson -  2011  Grands Crus  6  Tom Scudamore  David Pipe -  2012  Big Buck's  9  Ruby Walsh  Paul Nicholls -  2013  Reve De Sivola  9  Richard Johnson  Nick Williams -  2014  Knockara Beau  11  Jan Faltejsek  George Charlton -  2015  Saphir Du Rheu  6  Sam Twiston-Davies  Paul Nicholls -  2016  Thistlecrack  8  Tom Scudamore  Colin Tizzard -  2017  Unowhatimeanharry  9  Barry Geraghty  Harry Fry -  2018  Agrapart  7  Lizzie Kelly  Nick Williams -  2019  Paisley Park  7  Aidan Coleman  Emma Lavelle -  2020  Paisley Park  8  Aidan Coleman  Emma Lavelle } ==See also== * Horse racing in Great Britain * List of British National Hunt races ==References== * Racing Post: ** , , , , , , , , , ** , , , , , , , , , ** , , , , , , , , * * pedigreequery.com ‚Äì Cleeve Hurdle ‚Äì Cheltenham. ==External links== * Race Recordings Category:National Hunt races in Great Britain Category:Cheltenham Racecourse Category:National Hunt hurdle races Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1983 Category:1983 establishments in England ","title":"Cleeve Hurdle"},{"id":"9132357","text":"Laura Schwartz is an American professional speaker, author and television commentator.

It was produced as a prototype unit between 2003-2004 It was expected to be the first smartphone running the Series 90 GUI on Symbian OS and Nokia's first pen-based device, intending to compete against handsets like Sony Ericsson P800.http://www.cxotoday.com/story/nokia-7700/ At announcement Nokia dubbed it a \\"media device.\\" ==Features== The Nokia 7700 Compatible with GSM/HSCSD/GPRS/EDGE 900/1800/1900 MHz networks, the 7700 featured a wide, 3.5-inch touch-screen colour LCD with a resolution of 640 √ó 320 pixels which is the first smartphone with 2:1 aspect ratio and supporting 65,000 colours. It had 64 MB of internal memory and a MultiMedia Card (MMC) slot. It also included an integrated VGA camera with a maximum resolution of 640 √ó 480 pixels, an integrated FM radio, Bluetooth, USB and Nokia's proprietary Pop- Port interface for connectivity purposes. The 7700 was to include a comprehensive application suite (such as a complete PIM suite, 'full' web browser, email client and an office suite comprising Word Processor, Spread- Sheet and a PowerPoint viewer) and supported Java MIDP 2.0 applications. It was also to be the first phone to support Visual Radio, and the first Nokia phone to support DVB-H mobile television with the addition of the Nokia Streamer SU-6 accessory. ==Cancellation== The Nokia 7700 was cancelled in mid-2004. Several theories for the cancellation were put forward at the time: Nokia was refocusing on 'normal' phones due to decreasing market share; the phone would be too late to market; and the phone was unattractive and bulky. It also featured 'sidetalking' like the N-Gage, a feature that had attracted a great deal of negative publicity. ===Successor=== The Nokia 7710 followed shortly later with increased memory, a different design, no 'sidetalking' and other improvements. However, the 7700 was nevertheless used for further trials of DVB-H.Nokia - Developer Discussion Boards - DVB-H streaming with Nokia 7700 and 7710 - 2004-11-07, 22:27 ==Pricing== As stated above, the Nokia 7700 was never released to the public. It was only released to Nokia's R&D; (Research and Development) groups. A few models, estimated 20, were distributed prior to Nokia's decision to discontinue the model before full-on production. However as they were preparing to make the move into stores, the final product prototypes were available in every Nokia Dealer store for display and show- off, so an estimate on how many pieces there actually were is impossible to make, or how many remained in factories and services that were testing them. Pricing is thus very difficult to assess due to lack of official sales. Nevertheless, a few models were sold on eBay since Nokia's announcement of discontinuation. The lack of independent data to verify the sale records on eBay has caused some to overestimate the actual cost of the model. The phone is nevertheless considered by a number of Nokia collectors to be a rare piece. ==References== ==External links== *Nokia Press release - Multiple media go mobile with the Nokia 7700 *Nokia 7700 - Specs at GSMArena *Nokia 7700 Blog Category:Smartphones 7700 Category:Symbian devices ","title":"Nokia 7700"},{"id":"9132464","text":"Madiaba was a dance craze of the Democratic Republic of the Congo that occurred in the 1980s. ==References== Category:Democratic Republic of the Congo music ","title":"Madiaba"},{"id":"9132467","text":"John Golden Richards (born December 31, 1950) is a former professional American football wide receiver in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys and Chicago Bears. He played college football at Brigham Young University and the University of Hawaii. ==Early life== Richards attended Granite High School in South Salt Lake, Utah, where he lettered in 5 sports (football, basketball, track, tennis, baseball) and received All-state honors in 3 (football, basketball, track). In football he joined his brother Doug Richards and played fullback. He led the track & field team to the Utah Class A state title. In basketball, he played guard and was named second-team All- state. After being recruited by different division I colleges, he had decided to attend the University of Utah, but his church bishop influenced Richards to attend BYU instead of serving on a mission. From the start he was the fastest player on the BYU team and wore number 22 in honor of Bob Hayes. As a sophomore, he led the team in receiving with 36 receptions for 513 yards (fifth among WAC receivers) and 1 touchdown. As a junior, he again led the team in receiving with 14 receptions for 287 yards and 1 touchdown. He also had 33 punt returns for 624 yards (17.9 average) and 4 touchdowns, 23 kickoff returns for 468 yards (19.8 average). He was first in the nation in punt returns and 16th in all-purpose yards. He set four NCAA records with most punt return yards (219 against North Texas St.) in a game, most kickoff returns (247 yards, 7 returns) in a game, average per kickoff return (35.3 yards) in a season and tied the record for most touchdowns (4) on punt returns in a season. He received All-WAC honors. The combination of being ruled academically ineligible and BYU's run-oriented offense, made him take the decision to transfer to the University of Hawaii for his senior season. As a senior, he had 23 receptions for 414 yards and 5 touchdowns, before injuring his knee. ==Professional careerDallas Cowboys=== Richards was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round (46th overall) of the 1973 NFL Draft. As a rookie, he was the fastest player on the team and played mostly on special teams. In the NFC Championship against the Minnesota Vikings, he returned a punt 63 yards for a touchdown. In 1974, he was named the starter at wide receiver over Bob Hayes. He was the team's long threat (with receptions of 52, 58, 46 and 43 yards) and had his best statistical year with 26 receptions for 467 yards (18 average) and 5 touchdowns. In his third year, he had 21 receptions for 451 yards (21.5 average) and 4 touchdowns. In 1976, he had 19 receptions for 414 yards (21.8 average) and 3 touchdowns, missing 3 games because of a hamstring injury. The next season, his fourth straight as a starter, he alternated with Butch Johnson, recording 17 receptions for 225 yards (13.2 average) and 3 touchdowns. At the end of the year in Super Bowl XII against the Denver Broncos, he had his most notable career highlight, catching a 29-yard pass from fullback Robert Newhouse for the game clinching touchdown. In 1978 with the emergence of Tony Hill, he lost his starting position and was traded to the Chicago Bears, in exchange for a 5th round draft choice (#121-Bob Hukill) in 1979 and a 3rd round draft choice (#78-Bill Roe) in 1980. ===Chicago Bears=== In 1978, Richards had a career-high 27 receptions with the Chicago Bears. The next season, he played in only 5 games, before suffering a knee injury while blocking on Walter Payton's 65 yard touchdown reception against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, although he completed the game. His contract wasn't renewed after he was placed on the injured reserve list. ===Denver Broncos=== On May 8, 1980, he signed as a free agent with the Denver Broncos. He retired after suffering a second straight season- ending injury and being placed on the injured reserve list. ==Personal life== Richards was the host and co-producer of a hunting and fishing show for ESPN called \\"ESPN Outdoors\\". He was mentioned on \\"A Beer Can Named Desire\\" and \\"Cops and Robert\\" episodes of the cartoon sitcom King of the Hill. Richards' post NFL life included drug addiction, alcoholism, three divorces, and arrests for forgery. In 2011, he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, with doctors believing it being a combination of the hits from football and his drug usage being causes. He lives with his two sons, Goldie and Jordan. https://universe.byu.edu/2013/02/05/golden-richards/ ==See also== * List of NCAA major college yearly punt and kickoff return leaders ==References== ==External links== * Going Deep--Into a Hell : Former Cowboy Richards Has Seen Life Become Anything but Golden Because of Drugs Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:American football return specialists Category:American football wide receivers Category:BYU Cougars football players Category:Chicago Bears players Category:Dallas Cowboys players Category:Denver Broncos players Category:Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football players Category:Super Bowl champions Category:Sportspeople from Salt Lake City Category:Players of American football from Utah ","title":"Golden Richards"},{"id":"9132472","text":"Nadine Beiler (born May 27, 1990) is an Austrian R&B; and pop singer, who won the 3rd season of the Austrian casting show Starmania in 2007.

The album was originally recorded in 1989 for ffrr/London Records, who had signed the duo after they had built up underground success in their native city for their innovative Bristol underground scene sound, but the labels deemed the record unsuitable for release. The record explores links between dub music and British rave culture, incorporating styles of rock, reggae and electronic music with an emphasis on dub-style bass. The album title and artwork highlight the perceived association between the exposure of bass and maternity. Upon its release, Bass Is Maternal was largely commercially unsuccessful, although it peaked at number 35 on the UK R&B; Albums Chart. It received mixed and positive commentary from critics, who described the record as a long-awaited release. It has since been regarded as a groundbreaking album that anticipated 1990s progressions in drum and bass, jungle, trip hop and Bristolian music. In 2000, the album was re-released on Studio !K7. In the January 2001 issue of Spin, it was listed among the \\"Top 10 Reissues of the Year\\". In 2015, Fact placed the album at number 42 on the \\"50 Best Trip-Hop Albums of All Time\\" list, and cited it as \\"an important chapter in British musical history.\\" ==Background and production== Smith & Mighty, consisting of Rob Smith and Ray Mighty, formed in Bristol in the 1987. They became innovators of the Bristol sound, with initial endeavours including cutting up samples of pianist Erik Satie and applying them to hip hop-reggae rhythms, and recording with Pop Group member Mark Stewart on \\"Stranger Than Love\\". Alongside producing fellow Bristolian act Massive Attack's debut single \\"Any Love\\" and Fresh 4's sole hit \\"Wishing on a Star\\", Smith & Mighty released off- kilter covers of the Burt Bacharach and Hal David songs \\"Walk on By\\" and \\"Anyone Who Had a Heart.\\" These covers were ragga jungle recordings that highlighted the duo's interest in introducing pop song forms to experimental dance music. The singles turned Smith & Mighty into popular underground figures, and attracted the interest of ffrr/London Records, who signed the duo believing them to be a production team with a crossover style similar to Soul II Soul. Although the duo recorded Bass Is Maternal in 1989, the label did not want to release the album, deeming it unsuitable for release. The duo thus found themselves in \\"music industry purgatory,\\" unwilling to alter their style to fit ffrr/London's wishes, but contractually prevented from releasing the album elsewhere. While the record remained unreleased, the duo began working with other artists such as The Ragga Twins, Neneh Cherry and Beats International in the early 1990s, and only the 1992 proto-jungle EP Stepper's Delight and singer Carlton's 1991 album The Call Is Strong featured the duo's production skills during the era. The duo were finally freed from their contract with ffrr/London in 1994, and released a reworked version of Bass Is Maternal on Smith's recently-launched drum and bass label More Rockers in 1995. Smith later recalled: ==Composition== The album's usage of bass was compared to dub producers like Dennis Bovell (pictured). Bass Is Maternal is a trip hop album that explores the link between British rave culture and Jamaican dub music. The duo took an experimental approach, mixing dub, hip hop, reggae, rock and electronic music into numerous hybrids largely of a dance music nature. The record prominently incorporates dense jungle music, applying the genre's sped up breakbeats to dub music and shoegaze, and also fuses ambient music, electropop and usage of space synths, although characteristic of the album throughout is the heavy usage of seismic bass. The duo felt that the dub-style \\"low end pressure\\" bass, felt in the music of King Tubby, Prince Jammy and Scientist, was the main element of their production style. According to The Wire, Bass Is Maternal foregrounds the bass, but experiments with synth melodies and heavy, distorted drum sounds which are juxtaposed with \\"ghostly backwards guitar effects\\" and feedback. They compared the album's experimental trawl through different genres and soundscapes to dub producers like King Tubby, Scientist and Dennis Bovell and experimental post- punk bands like Public Image Ltd. \\"Hold On (Strange Mix)\\" is driven by distorted, backwards guitar, a breakbeat, ominous keyboards and a \\"sucked backwards\\" vocal, contributing to an atmosphere that The Wire said was \\"unlike anything you might have expected.\\" Jeff Salamon of Spin compared the reversed guitars to My Bloody Valentine. \\"Drowning\\" is a poignant, iconoclastic cover of U2's \\"Drowning Man\\" that mixes drum and bass and dub music. \\"Accept All Contrasts\\" mixes rapping with a Motown backbeat and the live snare snap from U2's \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\". Salamon noted that the usage of the U2 sample was \\"years before DJ Shadow sampled it on 'Lost and Found'.\\" ==Title and artwork== The album title Bass Is Maternal reflects the duo's incorporation of \\"enwombling\\" low-end frequency felt in Jamaican dub music. The association between bass sounds and maternal themes also feature in the album's vocals, while the artwork draws upon bass's perceived relationship with the beat of the heart. For instance, the cover of Bass Is Maternal shows a child stood beside the sea, presumably listening to \\"the heartbeat regularity of the tide,\\" while the booklet contains four ultrasound scans of fetuses and a depiction of a young child reaching towards a bass speaker with the caption \\"Bass is maternal... When it's loud I feel safer.\\" According to The Wire, the caption refers to \\"the kind of warm, enveloping sub-bass that reverberated through your solar plexus and rose up through the rib cage.\\" ==Release and reception== Although the eventual 1995 release of Bass Is Maternal by More Rockers was described as long-awaited, the trip hop and ragga jungle styles the duo helped innovate had moved beyond them, as although Bristol had become recognised as the birthplace of trip hop, the duo remained obscure. The album was not a commercial success, although it peaked at number 35 on the UK R&B; Albums Chart in November 1995. After being unavailable for some time, Bass Is Maternal was re-released by Studio !K7 on 13 June 2000. This reissue marked the album's first release in the United States, and reached number 9 on the CMJ Dance chart, compiled from reports of radio play. In his book Drum 'n' Bass: The Rough Guide, writer Peter Shapiro wrote that Bass Is Maternal was released to \\"a rather lukewarm reception.\\" In a contemporary review, Gary Mulholland of Select praised the \\"awkwardness\\" of the album, citing the track name \\"Odd Tune for Piano\\" and the inaccessibility of \\"Hold On (Strange Mix)\\" as examples. He felt the attitude reached \\"a surreal peak\\" with \\"Drowning\\" and \\"Accept All Contrasts\\", and concluded that although the album's release date was too late to make Smith & Mighty stars on Massive Attack's level, he felt the duo \\"probably couldn't be bothered with the hassle anyway.\\" Less receptive was John Bush of AllMusic, who in a mixed review said the album featured \\"too much experimentation and not enough hooks,\\" and felt that throughout the record, the duo \\"simply don't find a happy medium between jungle and reggae.\\" In a review of the reissue, Jeff Salamon of Spin praised the album's innovative, forward-thinking sound. Although he felt that the record was somewhat scattered, he characterised it favourably with one of Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies: \\"the gamut of choices open to an artist willing to surrender his or her ego.\\" Writer Colin Larkin gave the album three stars out of five in The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music, feeling that the record was characterised by its heavy usage of bass, despite its incorporation of denser jungle music. ==Legacy== Bass Is Maternal has retrospectively been cited by critics as a groundbreaking album that, despite largely originating frpm 1989, helped predict various strands of mid-1990s music, especially that of the Bristol sound. Jeff Salamon of Spin described the album as \\"way ahead of its time‚Äìthe sound of 1995, only recorded in 1989.\\" Craig Roseberry of Billboard wrote that the \\"groundbreaking\\" album, and the duo's \\"desconstruted reconstructions\\" of Burt Bacharach songs in the late 1980s, \\"helped cement the act's underground cult status.\\" The magazine also call the band the originators of \\"the Bristol sound\\". Tim Haslett of CMJ New Music Monthly called the album \\"gorgeous\\" and \\"underrated,\\" while The Wire magazine said the album \\"provided a link between the past, present and future of the Bristol dance scene.\\" In 2012, Music Is My Sanctuary called the album \\"one of the most influential UK records to come out in the last 20 years, setting the table for drum & bass and bass music in general.\\" In January 2001, Spin ranked the re- release among their list of the \\"Top 10 Reissues of the Year.\\" In the accompanying text, Jon Caramanica called the duo \\"forefathers of Bristol's tripped-out bass-science scene\\" and wrote how they \\"explored all stripes of thick groove\\" throughout Bass Is Maternal. He cited \\"Jungle Man Corner\\" as birthing \\"the reggae-jungle connection five years ahead of schedule,\\" and described the record as \\"hooking up Mad Professor and Massive Attack years before they did it themselves.\\" The Wire also listed it among the best reissues of 2000. In 2015, Fact placed Bass Is Maternal at number 42 on their list of \\"The 50 Best Trip-Hop Albums of All Time\\". The website described the album as \\"the best representation\\" of the duo's scope, noting that it \\"illustrates their experimentation as they attempted to summarize the meeting point between UK rave culture and Jamaican dub. It‚Äôs not always successful, but to ignore it is to disregard an important chapter in British musical history.\\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== { class=\\" plainrowheaders sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" !scope=\\"col\\" Chart !scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\" UK R&B; Albums (OCC)  35 - } ==References== ==External links== * Category:1995 debut albums Category:Smith & Mighty albums Category:Rave albums Category:Drum and bass albums Category:Dub albums ","title":"Bass Is Maternal"},{"id":"9132477","text":"Katarina Agnes Wigander (born 1983 in Lerum, V√§sterg√∂tland) is a model and former Miss Sweden.Stureplan.se: H√§r √§r ditt liv, Katarina Wigander!, accessed on 10 May 2010 Her victory in the beauty pageant was controversial in her home country, as she was crowned by Moore Magazine, a magazine for men which publishes pictures for other Swedish \\"men's\\" magazines, such as Slitz.Nu viker Fr√∂ken Sverige ut sig, Expressen 2004-05-26 In 2004, Moore Magazine and Bingo Rim√©r managed to take over crowning after the old arrangers had stopped holding the pageant after 2003.

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can recognize and destroy cancer cells. However, an inhibitory mechanism interrupts this destruction. Ipilimumab turns off this inhibitory mechanism and boosts the body's immune response against cancer cells. Ipilimumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2011, for the treatment of melanoma, a type of skin cancer. It is undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), (completed) bladder cancer (completed) and metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. (completed) The concept of using anti-CTLA4 antibodies to treat cancer was first developed by James P. Allison while he was director of the Cancer Research Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. Clinical development of anti-CTLA4 was initiated by Medarex, which was later acquired by Bristol-Myers Squibb. For his work in developing ipilimumab, Allison was awarded the Lasker Award in 2015. Allison later was the co-winner of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. == Medical uses == Ipilimumab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2011, to treat people with late-stage melanoma that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery. It was later approved by the US FDA on October 28, 2015, for stage 3 patients as adjuvant therapy. On February 1, 2012, Health Canada approved ipilimumab for \\"treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in patients who have failed or do not tolerate other systemic therapy for advanced disease.\\" Ipilimumab was approved in the European Union (EU), for second line treatment of metastatic melanoma in November 2012. Nivolumab, in combination with ipilimumab is indicated for the treatment of intermediate or poor risk, previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma. Ipilimumab, in combination with nivolumab, is indicated for the treatment of adults and adolescents twelve years and older with microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient metastatic colorectal cancer that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Ipilimumab, in combination with nivolumab, is indicated for the treatment of people with hepatocellular carcinoma who have been previously treated with sorafenib. Ipilimumab, in combination with nivolumab, is indicated for the first-line treatment of adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 (‚â•1%) as determined by an FDA-approved test. In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab for the first-line treatment of adults with malignant pleural mesothelioma that cannot be removed by surgery. This is the first drug regimen approved for mesothelioma in sixteen years and the second FDA-approved systemic therapy for mesothelioma. == Adverse effects == A major drawback of ipilimumab therapy is its association with severe and potentially fatal immunological adverse effects due to T cell activation and proliferation, occurring in ten to twenty percent of patients. Serious adverse effects include stomach pain, bloating, constipation, diarrhea, fever, trouble breathing, and urinating problems. A \\"risk evaluation and mitigation strategy\\" informs prescribers of the potential risks.Drugs.com: Yervoy Between 5.7 and 9.1% of individuals treated with ipilimumab develop checkpoint inhibitor induced colitis. Individual cases of severe neurologic disorders following ipilimumab have been observed, including acute inflammatory demyelination polyneuropathy and an ascending motor paralysis, and myasthenia gravis. == Interactions == The combination of ipilimumab with either leflunomide or vemurafenib may lead to increased hepatotoxicity. Systemic corticosteroids should be avoided before starting ipilimumab; however, systemic corticosteroids may be used to treat an immune-related adverse reaction that arises from ipilimumab treatment. Patients taking anticoagulants with ipilimumab should be monitored due to an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. == Mechanism of action == T lymphocytes can recognize and destroy cancer cells. However, an inhibitory mechanism interrupts this destruction. Ipilimumab turns off this inhibitory mechanism and allows the lymphocytes to continue to destroy cancer cells. Cancer cells produce antigens, which the immune system can use to identify them. These antigens are recognized by dendritic cells that present the antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the lymph nodes. The CTLs recognize the cancer cells by those antigens and destroy them. However, along with the antigens, the dendritic cells present an inhibitory signal. That signal binds to a receptor, cytotoxic T lymphocyte- associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), on the CTL and turns off the cytotoxic reaction. This allows the cancer cells to survive. Ipilimumab binds to CTLA-4, blocking the inhibitory signal, which allows the CTLs to destroy the cancer cells. In 2014 a study indicated that the antibody works by allowing the patients' T cells to target a greater variety of antigens rather than by increasing the number attacking a single antigen. == Identifying patients most likely to respond == During ‚Äúcancer immunoediting\\", tumor cells can produce antigens that provoke a reduced immune response and/or establish an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). The latter can arise as a consequence of repeated, ineffective T cell stimulation. This triggers the checkpoint that ipilumumab targets. Many patients do not benefit from treatment, which may be related to reduced mutation load and/or missense point mutation-derived neoantigens. Tumor antigens can either be improperly expressed normal proteins or abnormal proteins with tumor-specific expression. Somatic cancer mutations can produce ‚Äúnonself‚Äù tumor-specific mutant antigens (neoantigens). Sequencing and epitope prediction algorithms identified neoantigens in mouse tumors that functioned as tumor-specific T cell targets. Neoantigens were recognized by T cells in melanoma patients and were likely the major contributor to positive clinical effects of adoptive cell transfer. Mouse models established that neoantigens were the targets of T cells activated by checkpoint blockade therapy and that synthetic long peptides comprising these neoantigens were effective when administered as vaccines with CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 mAbs. Cancers with higher mutation burdens, and an associated likelihood of expressing neoantigens, appear most likely to respond to checkpoint therapy. In melanoma and certain other cancers, the numbers of mutations and neoantigens correlate with patient response. Increased PD ligand 2 (PD-L2) transcript expression and an immune ‚Äúcytolytic‚Äù gene signature also correlated with neoantigen load and tumor response. CTLA-4 expression was a response indicator, which along with PD-L2 were likely expressed in tumor- infiltrating immune cells. An inflamed TME prior to treatment is also associated with response. Nearly all neoantigens in one study were patient- specific and most likely reflected mutations that do not directly contribute to tumorigenesis. However, none revealed features or motifs exclusive to responders. == Clinical trial history == In the 2000s, ipilimumab clinical trials were under way on patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancers, urothelial carcinoma and ovarian cancer. By 2007, there were two fully human anti CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies in advanced clinical trials. Ipilimumab, which is an IgG1 isotype, and tremelimumab (from Pfizer) which is an IgG2 isotype. ===Melanoma=== On December 10, 2007, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Medarex released the results of three studies on ipilimumab for melanoma. The three studies tested 487 patients with advanced skin cancer. One of the three studies failed to meet its primary goal of shrinking tumors in at least 10.0% of the study's 155 patients. Side effects included rashes, diarrhea, and hepatitis. In 2010, a study was presented that showed a median survival of ten months in advanced melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, compared with 6.4 months for those treated with gp100, an experimental vaccine (n=676), and 10.1 months for those treated with both the vaccine and ipilimumab. The Phase III clinical studies on the drug were controversial for their unconventional use of a control arm (as opposed to using a placebo or standard treatment). Ipilimumab gained FDA approval in March 2011. ===Prostate cancer=== In 2008/09 Medarex performed a phase I/II dose escalation clinical trial of ipilimumab in metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC). Some of the patients with advanced prostate cancer had their tumors drastically shrink, promoting further trials. On June 19, 2009, the Mayo Clinic reported two prostate cancer patients involved in a phase II study using MDX-010 therapy who had been told initially that their condition was inoperable but had their tumors shrunk by the drug such that operation was possible and are now cancer-free as a result. This press report however was criticized as premature and somewhat inaccurate. The clinical trials were still at an early stage and were run alongside other treatments ‚Äì which could have been the real explanation for the tumor shrinkage. It was too early to say whether ipilimumab made any difference. In 2016, a phase II study using ipilimumab and nivolumab in AR-V7-expressing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer was opened. AR-V7 is an androgen receptor splice variant that can be detected in circulating tumor cells of metastatic prostate cancer patients. ===Lung cancer=== Medarex ran a phase II trial of ipilimumab in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy (carboplatin) in participants with small cell and non-small cell lung cancer. It was scheduled to run from February 2008, to December 2011. ===Bladder cancer=== Early results of a trial in urothelial carcinoma have been reported. == Combination trials Advanced melanoma=== To increase response rate and reduce adverse reactions, various drug combinations are being tested. In 2013, a trial was running that compared ipilimumab alone against ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab. The response rate (tumours shrinking by at least 30%) was 58% for the combination, 44% for nivolumab alone, and 19% for ipilimumab alone. This combination gained FDA approval for melanoma in Oct 2015. In March 2014, an open-label, randomized, two agent, single center trial started combining ipilimumab with phosphatidylserine-targeting immunotherapy bavituximab for the treatment of advanced melanoma. The number of treated patients in arm A (ipilimumab plus bavituximab) was to be 16, with 8 in arm B (ipilimumab only). The trial was expected to complete in March 2016. Previous, preclinical studies showed that PS targeting antibodies (such as bavituximab) enhance the anti-tumor activity of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies. Tumor growth inhibition correlates with infiltration of immune cells in tumors and induction of adaptive immunity. The combination of these mechanisms promotes strong, localized, anti-tumor responses without the side-effects of systemic immune activation. == Development == Following the 1987 cloning of CTLA-4 in mice, its conservation in humans and similarities with CD28 were soon noticed. CD28 at that time was a recently identified \\"T cell costimulatory\\" molecule important for T cell activation. Anti-CTLA-4 blockade, the invention that gave rise to ipilimumab, was conceived by Allison and Krummel along with CTLA-4's inhibitory role in T cell activation.Krummel, M.F. (1995). Identification and Characterization of a CTLA-4 Dependent Regulatory Mechanism for T Cell Activation (University of California, Berkeley). They were able to demonstrate that CTLA-4 signaling in T cells inhibited T cell responses. They then injected intact antibodies and demonstrated that CTLA-4 blockade enhanced T cell responses in mice responding to vaccines and to super antigens. Leach, a new postdoctoral fellow, was tasked by Allison with applying these in tumor models. Antibody-treated mice showed significantly less cancer growth than the controls. Bluestone and Linsley separately studied the similarities between CD28 and CTLA-4. Bluestone's lab published studies, one together with Krummel and Allison, for in vitro studies of CTLA-4 function. In collaboration with Mark Jenkins, they were able to see effects of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in vivo in an immunization setting, but did not effectively carry this into tumor biology. Linsley and colleagues had made antibodies against CTLA-4 three years prior to those of Krummel/Allison or Walunas/Bluestone. They concluded that the molecule functioned similarly to CD28 and was a \\"positive costimulator\\". They apparently did not pursue CTLA-4 tumor targeting, although BMS licensed the Allison/Leach/Krummel patent through their acquisition of Medarex and the fully humanized antibody MDX010, which later became ipilimumab. ==References* Category:Bristol-Myers Squibb Category:Monoclonal antibodies for tumors ","title":"Ipilimumab"},{"id":"9132494","text":"Vicky Longomba in 1960 Victor Longomba Besange Lokuli, commonly known as Vicky Longomba, (December 13, 1932 ‚Äì March 12, 1988 in Kinshasawww.congolite.ca) was a singer and a founding member of Tout puissant OK Jazz, a Congolese rumba group.Franco: National Geographic World Music He later formed his own group, Lovy du Zaire.

He arrived to British Ceylon in 1852 and settled down in Loolecondera estate in Delthota. Here he worked with Scottish merchant Thomas Lipton to develop the tea industry in British Ceylon. He continued to live in British Ceylon until his death (more than half of his lifetime). ==Life in Loolecondera== Taylor visited India in 1866 to learn the basics of growing tea on plantations; following his return, he started a plantation in Loolecondera estate in Kandy (Sri Lanka - formerly known as Ceylon). He began the tea plantation an estate of just in 1867. He started a fully equipped tea factory on the Loolecondera estate in 1872. During the period when Taylor lived on the Loolecondera estate, the export of tea increased from 23 pounds to 81 tonnes and in 1890 it reached the level of 22,900 tonnes. The story of tea in British Ceylon began in 1867. A Scotsman, James Taylor had cleared of forest in the District of Hewaheta Lower to plant the first seedlings in what is now known as the No.7 field of the Loolecondera Estate. Today even people who have never heard of Sri Lanka are familiar with Ceylon tea, which is known for its quality. ==Achievement== In year 1872 Taylor set about building a larger tea factory in Loolecondera and started manufacturing packeted tea. He had already written about his success of starting a larger tea factory as \\"I have a machine of my own invention being made in Kandy for rolling tea which I think will be successful\\". In 1875 Taylor managed to send the first shipment of Ceylon tea to the London Tea Auction. ==Taylor and Lipton== Sir Thomas Johnstone Lipton Thomas Lipton a millionaire in United Kingdom visited British Ceylon (Sri Lanka) in the 1890s, during his journey to Australia, and met Taylor. They discussed the business of exporting tea from British Ceylon. Lipton's company became interested and started buying Ceylon tea. ==Death and after== James Taylor in the 1870s The rapid growth of the Ceylonese tea industry allowed the large tea companies to take over therefore the small farmers like Taylor were chased out from the industry. Because of this, Taylor was dismissed by the Loolecondera estate management. Taylor died 1892, one year after his dismissal from Loolecondera estate, from severe gastroenteritis and dysentery. His body was buried in the Mahaiyawa Cemetery in Kandy . His headstone reads, \\"In pious memory of James Taylor of Loolecondera Estate Ceylon, the pioneer of the cinchona and tea enterprise in this island, who died 2 May 1892, aged 57 years\\". In 1893 one year after his death, one million packets of Ceylon tea of the first shipment to London were sold at the Chicago World's Fair. The majority of the tea estates (more than 80 percent) were owned by British Companies from the time of James Taylor who began the industry in 1867 until 1971 when the government of Sri Lanka introduced a Land Reform Act which granted the ownership of tea estates to the government (nationalisation of the tea industry). ==Centenary of death== John Field, the High Commissioner for the United Kingdom in Sri Lanka made a comment in 1992 for the 100th anniversary of the death of Taylor: \\"It can be said of very few individuals that their labours have helped to shape the landscape of a country, but the beauty of the hill country as it now appears owes much to the inspiration of James Taylor, the man who introduced tea cultivation to Sri Lanka\\". A museum was also built in 1992 to commemorate him in the place where he lived. == James Taylor Monument == On Saturday 29 June 2019, the Auchenblae Heritage Society unveiled a statue to commemorate James Taylor.

He was also the chairman of Gauhati Municipality in 1919 and Minister-in-Charge of Education and Agriculture for Assam from 1924 to 1934. He was educated at Cotton College, Guwahati and at Presidency College, Calcutta. He was knighted in the 1928 Birthday Honours and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE) in the 1946 Birthday Honours.The London Gazette, 4 June 1928The London Gazette, 13 June 1946 ==Early life== Syed Muhammad Saadulla was born on 21 May 1885 in Guwahati, to an orthodox Assamese Muslim family. His advent as the second son of Syed Muhammad Tayyabulla came from Kacharihat, a village near the town of Golaghat, to Guwahati around 1878. ==Lawyer== Tall and athletic, Syed Muhammad Saadulla, M.A., B.L., a youthful 24-year-old, became a Pleader in Guwahati and set up practice at Lakhtakia in 1910. In the same year, he married the eldest daughter of Syed Muhammad Saleh of Kacharihat. He soon made his mark as a lawyer. He became Chairman, Guwahati Municipality, and was nominated as a member of the Legislative Council at Shillong. Assam became a chief Commissioners Province in April 1912. Although a nominated member Saadulla energetically participated in the Council's deliberations, and expressed himself freely and forcefully on the matters of interest of the people of Assam. The qualities of citizenship which inspired him to unselfish efforts for what he believed to be right and patriotic were evident early in his political career. Preoccupation with legal profession and civic responsibilities and duties of a Legislative Councillor left Saadulla with little time for recreation. Nevertheless, he played association football and cricket for the Town Club regularly at Judge's Field. Most afternoons he played Lawn tennis at the erstwhile Jubilee Gardens, where the regulars were Tarun Ram Phukan, Gopinath Bordoloi and Hemanta Kumar Lahiri. With his enhanced fortunes Saadulla bought a plot of land adjacent to his father's house, and built a large residence for the joint family and an outhouse to serve as his office. He soon became a prominent figure in the Province of Assam. Saadulla displayed tireless energy, indestructible self-confidence, a searching and analytical mind, and prodigious memory. In a decade, all ambition has been fulfilled, and Saadulla was recognized as the most conspicuous pleader in Assam. He had the gratification of being able to refuse two offers of important employment under the Government. He became restless and found himself disposed to a change. He consulted his younger brother, Syed Muhibulla, a Professor of Arabic and Persian at Cotton College, Guwahati and asked for the blessings of his 80-year-old father, and prepared to leave for Calcutta. In 1920, in his mid-thirties, Saadulla, enrolled himself as an Advocate at the Calcutta High Court. He rented a house in Turner Street in the neighborhood of A.K. Fazlul Huq, Nawab Ataur Rahman, Barrister Khuda Bux and Nawabzada A.F.M. Abdul Ali. Before long, briefs from Assam for appeal before the High Court began to arrive and once more Saadulla was engrossed in preparing plaints. Success came slowly, but no sooner he was settled in the new establishment his wife and three sons joined him and spent as much time in their company as possible. Assam became a Governor's province, under the Government of India Act 1919, with an enlarged Legislative Council; and accordingly Elections were held in November 1920. Saadulla decided to concentrate on practice at the Calcutta High Court, and therefore did not enter Assam politics. He came to Guwahati with his family to be at the bed- side of his dying father, Syed Tayyabulla, who died on 22 November 1922. A year later he returned to Assam once more to stand for elections to the Reformed Legislative Council, and was returned with a comfortable majority. ==Politics== Towards the end of February, 1924 Saadulla received a letter from Sir John Henry Kerr, Governor of Assam offering him a seat in his Executive Council as Minister. As the newly elected Legislative Council was due to meet at Shillong on 24 March, there was very little time to decide between Calcutta High Court Bar and Ministership in Assam. A man of instant decisions, he wrote to the Governor accepting his offer and assuring him of reaching Shillong well in advance of the date of commencement of the Council session. His colleagues and friends and relatives were unanimous in warmly approving his decision. Saadulla was sworn in as Minister, and he rented a house known as \\"Rookwood\\" for his family. 1924 was a bad year for him; his beloved wife died at child- birth in the early hours of 9 December. He never really recovered from the cruel shock and profound grief. He never remarried and immersed himself in work and bringing up an infant daughter and looking after three sons. Elections to the third Reformed council were held in November, 1926, and Saadulla was returned from his constituency by large majority. He was re- appointed as a Minister. The honour of Knighthood was conferred on him in 1928. The following year, Sir Egbert Laurie Lucas Hammond, Governor of Assam invited him to join his Executive Council, as a member for a term of five years. After eleven years at Shillong, and disenchanted with Assam politics, he felt that it was time for him to make a move. Opportunity was at hand, Sir John Anderson, Governor of Bengal, had personally offered him a High Court Judgeship. Sir Syed Muhammad Saadulla went to Calcutta in 1935. Much to his dismay, Sir Harold Darbyshire, the Chief Justice, pointed out that he could not be appointed as a Judge for want of requisite experience of ten years of continuous practice at the Bar. In an effort to assuage his profound disappointment, he was appointed as a Government Pleader with an assurance of elevation to the Bench within a reasonable period. The lure of politics combined with tremendous pressure by former colleagues was too strong for him. A General Election, under the Government of India Act., 1935, was being held in February, 1937. Saadulla returned to Assam and was elected to the Legislative Assembly. The Governor invited him to form the Ministry. It was his inestimable good fortune that he was premier of Assam. With a depressed interruptions, for nine years, a deeply religious man, he supported political and social creed with uncompromising integrity. He headed the Coalition Ministry from 1 April 1937 to 10h September 1938 and from 17 November 1939 to 25 December 1941 and again from 24 August 1942 to 11 February 1946. There were turbulent years in Assam politics and blessed with sturdy constitution, he performed with exemplary courage the onerous task with devotion and enthusiasm and generosity. In every public duty, he held the interest of the people of Assam foremost in his heart. The honour of Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE) was conferred upon him on 1 January 1946. As Assam premier Muhammad Sadullah also undertook land settlement policy to populate the state with migrants from erstwhile East Bengal. Known as the Line System, the policy had its roots in a British effort to extract more revenue from Assam by making the land more productive (since the local peasants were not willing to work for the British). It later amped up the migration policy under its ‚Äúgrow more food‚Äù programme in the build-up to World War II. The Muslim League government in Assam under Sadullah further fuelled the policy, so much so that Viceroy Lord Wavell later wrote in his memoirs that Sadullah was much more interested in ‚Äúgrowing more Muslims‚Äù. Saadulla also remained a close friend and associate of the Punjab Premier/Chief Minister Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan (in power from 1937 to 1942) and was a member of the Executive Committee of the All India Muslim League which met in March 1940 to draft the Lahore or 'Pakistan Resolution '. The Assam Legislative Assembly elected Saadulla to the Constituent Assembly of India in 1947 and the later elected him to the drafting committee. Thus he helped in the preparation of the Constitution of the Republic of India. He was the only member from the North East India to be elected to the Drafting Committee. He was seriously ill in 1951. Death seemed likely, but it did not alarm him. What he dreaded with undispellable foreboding was physical and mental disability. He recovered gradually and was restored to health. Thereafter he mournfully accepted life in retirement, and amenities of civilized existence. He morosely consoled himself with social activities, including dispensing hospitality on magnificent scale. His health deteriorated, at the approach of winter at Shillong, and to escape the rigours of cold weather, he went down to plains. He died at Guwahati, his birthplace, on 8 January 1955. ==References== *C. F. J.

Zhu Manyue was said to be from the Wu region, now southern Jiangsu. Because someone from her family, probably her father, was accused of crimes, she was forced to be a servant and assigned to the palace of Yuwen Yun, who was then crown prince under his father Emperor Wu. She was in charge of the clothes of Yuwen Yun, 12 years younger than her.

He was an esteemed teacher and a Swedish royal envoy. ==Early life== Paavali, as he was known before his ecclesiastical career, was initially schooled at the Viborg School of Latin. His parents, burgher Pietari Juusten and his wife Anna, owned their townhouse near the Blackfriars' monastery at Viborg. The street bore the name Juusteninkatu until the town centuries later was ceded to the Soviet Union. His parents seemingly died in ca. 1530 due to the plague.

He succeeded Mikael Agricola as headmaster of Turku cathedral school in 1548. He was member of the diocese chapter in 1553 and in 1554.

After he was named most valuable player of the Hula Bowl, he was drafted by the Cleveland Browns as the first overall selection in the 1954 NFL Draft. The Browns had needed someone to take over for the veteran Otto Graham, but they soon discovered that Garrett had a liability as a quarterback: he stuttered, which made calling plays difficult. Garrett never played a game for the Browns, who traded him along with halfback Don Miller and linemen Johnny Bauer and Chet Gierula to the Green Bay Packers for quarterback Babe Parilli and offensive tackle Bob Fleck. The Packers wanted a backup for veteran Tobin Rote, but did not learn of Garrett's stutter before making the trade.

He copied large chunks of earlier music treatises. These included Boethius' De institutione musica and the treatises of Johannes Cotto, Johannes de Garlandia, Franco of Cologne and Petrus de Picardia. The treatise was probably compiled after 1272, and the only extant manuscript was probably copied before 1304. The original owner of this manuscript was Pierre de Limoges, and it was given to the Sorbonne when he died. Anonymous IV was most likely aware of this manuscript when he wrote.

In July 1943 he was upgraded to \\"first pilot\\" and assigned a crew, flying 7 additional missions before being seriously injured in a crash landing on September 23. After a lengthy recuperation and a staff assignment at Headquarters, US Strategic Air Forces (USSTAF), he was selected by a former commander, Col. Henry Terry, now commanding the 91st Bomb Group, to command its 324th Bomb Squadron on July 30, 1944. The 324th BS at that time had assigned to it all the H2X radar \\"Mickey ships\\" and often led the group, wing, and division on missions where cloud cover was expected to obstruct the target. Klette flew missions for the duration of the war in Europe, including the last bomb mission of the Eighth Air Force on April 25, 1945. Over 30 of his missions were as group, wing, division, or air force mission commander while serving with the 91st Bomb Group. His success many have been partly due to his preparations for his bombing missions. He thoroughly studied the details of bombing missions and had learned how to operate every piece of equipment on a B-17 Flying Fortress. ==References== Category:1918 births Category:1988 deaths Category:United States Army Air Forces officers Category:United States Army Air Forces pilots of World War II ","title":"Immanuel J.

The one-day, family event, which began in 1973, features a woolly bear costume contest in which children, even pets, are dressed up as various renditions of the woolly bear caterpillar. The festival is held every year around October 1 on a Sunday on which the Cleveland Browns either have an away game or are not playing. It is touted as the largest one-day festival in Ohio, with attendance over 100,000. ==History== The festival is the brainchild of Dick Goddard, long-time weatherman at Cleveland's WJW-TV. The Woolly Bear Caterpillar is similarly celebrated for its mythical association to winter forecasting. After the caterpillars' eggs hatch in fall, folklore suggests the severity of an upcoming winter can be gauged by observing the amount of black versus orange in the caterpillars' bands. Attracting 2,000 spectators in the first year, the number grew to an estimated 15,000 by the eighth festival and quickly overwhelmed the town of Birmingham. Of the 13 cities that expressed interest, organizers selected Vermilion as the new home.

In May 2010 he retired as chair of ShoreBank Corporation and took the position of Advisor to the Board of Directors of ShoreBank Corporation. ==Early life and career== Ron Grzywinski was born in 1936 in Chicago's South Chicago community area on the city's south side. His banking career began at the First National Bank of Lockport, and he moved to the Hyde Park Bank in 1967. In 1973, Ron and three colleagues (Milton Davis, James Fletcher, and Mary Houghton) purchased the South Shore Bank (eventually renaming it ShoreBank) in Chicago's South Shore neighborhood to fight redlining. It was America's first community development bank, and it has grown into what is, by most accounts, the most successful community development and microfinance institution in the country. The bank's successful combination of a social mission with profitability finds it frequently cited as \\"doing well while doing good.\\" ==Work with ShoreBank== In 1977, Ron was the only banker to testify in favor of the Community Reinvestment Act which required banks and thrifts meet the credit needs of the communities in which they did business, including low- and middle-income residents. Thanks in part to Ron‚Äôs testimony, it was enacted by congress later that year.Text of Housing and Community Development Act of 1977‚Äîtitle Viii (Community Reinvestment) . In the 1980s Ron worked in Bangladesh with Muhammad Yunus through a grant from the Ford Foundation to help design and incorporate the Grameen Bank. Ron Grzywinski and Muhammad Yunus in Chicago in late 2006. In 1985, he worked closely with then Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton to set up the Southern Development Bancorporation, a community development bank serving rural Arkansans. In 1997, Ron helped to launch ShoreBank Pacific, the nation‚Äôs first commercial bank formed to support environmentally sustainable development. Under Ron's stewardship ShoreBank grew into a $1.9 billion bank, helped finance the purchase and renovation of 49,000 affordable housing residences, and issued nearly $900 million in loans to citizens in Chicago, Detroit, and Cleveland between 2001 and 2006. ==Boards and Committees== In addition to ShoreBank, Ron works with the boards of the Southern Development Bancorporation in Arkansas, the Grameen Bank and BRAC in Bangladesh, XacBank in Mongolia, the Aga Khan Foundation in Pakistan, and the Ashoka Global Academy in India. He is a charter member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion. Ron serves on the board of judges for Social Accountability International's Corporate Conscience Awards. ==Awards and honors== In 1988, Ron received the Medal for Entrepreneurial Excellence from the Yale School of Management. In 2001, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Northern Michigan University. In 2005, Ron received the John W. Gardner Leadership Award from the Independent Sector recognizing a career that has ‚Äútransformed underserved neighborhoods into vibrant communities and inspired a community development banking movement worldwide.‚Äù Ron was the first person from a for-profit business to win this award. In 2006, Ron (along with ShoreBank co-founder Mary Houghton) received the Gleitsman Citizen Activist Award at Harvard University for work transforming ‚Äúunder-served urban neighborhoods across the country into vibrant communities.‚Äù In the same year, he accepted the 2006 Ethics Award from Western Illinois University.

Morris was born in Kidderminster, but adopted by a Welsh family. He joined the Labour Party at the age of fifteen, and as a young man he worked in a steel foundry in Llanelli, South Wales. During National Service in the late 1940s he was exempted from military service as a conscientious objector, conditional upon working down coal mines. He gained a scholarship to Ruskin College, Oxford, and became a Presbyterian minister in 1958. Morris became an anti-nuclear campaigner in 1957, opposing Operation Grapple X, in which Britain tested nuclear weapons including its first hydrogen bombs over the Pacific Ocean atoll of Christmas Island (now Kiritimati). ==Political career== Morris served as a Labour Party Councillor in South Wales, and unsuccessfully contested Brecon and Radnorshire at the 1983 general election before being elected in 1984 as the Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for Mid and West Wales. After boundary changes he served until 1999, latterly representing South Wales West, an area corresponding to Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend. In the late 1990s, due to the introduction of a list system of proportional representation for British seats, the Labour Party introduced a transitional selection process to determine its candidates for the 1999 European elections. Like other internal Labour Party processes of the time (e.g. \\"Labour London Mayor Selection\\" and the \\"Welsh Labour Leadership Election\\"), the process to determine the order of candidates on the party list for the 1999 elections was controversial, with allegations that it was undemocratic and designed to sideline left-of-centre candidates, such as Morris. Morris, like the other sitting Welsh MEPs, was re- elected to be a Labour candidate by members in his own soon-to-be-defunct constituency. However, in the more important process to determine the Welsh Labour candidates‚Äô party list ranking, Morris was placed too low to have a realistic chance of being elected, and he therefore withdrew as a candidate. He blamed his deselection on his outspoken opposition to the Trident project.CND Campaign Review 2007 p15 After retiring from the European Parliament, Morris remained active in Welsh and Labour politics. Indeed, he eventually benefited from the democratisation of the Welsh Labour Party that occurred after Rhodri Morgan took over as leader, when he was elected to represent \\"South West Wales\\" (the same area as his former European constituency) on the National Executive Committee of the Welsh Labour Party, on which he served until 2006. ==Sources== *Guardian obituary ==References== Category:1930 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Foundrymen Category:Welsh Labour councillors Category:British conscientious objectors Category:British anti-war activists Category:Calvinist pacifists Category:Welsh Christian pacifists Category:Welsh Labour MEPs Category:People from Kidderminster Category:MEPs for Wales 1984‚Äì1989 Category:MEPs for Wales 1989‚Äì1994 Category:MEPs for Wales 1994‚Äì1999 Category:Alumni of Ruskin College ","title":"David Morris (Labour politician)"},{"id":"9132879","text":"Elsilimomab (also known as B-E8) is a mouse monoclonal antibody and an immunosuppressive drug.

His home of Chiefswood, built in 1856 on the Grand River, has been designated and preserved as a National Historic Site; it is the only First Nations mansion from the pre-Canadian Confederation era. ==Early life== Johnson was born at Bow Park on the Grand River on the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation near Brantford in 1816. The Wolf clan members had founded the Reserve after resettling from New York during the American Revolution. He was the son of John Smoke Johnson, a Mohawk Bear clan chief, and Helen Martin, a Mohawk whose Dutch mother Catherine Rolleston had been captured as a girl and adopted and assimilated into the Wolf clan.\\"Johnson Family Tree\\" , Chiefswood National Historic Site, accessed 27 May 2011, Source: Betty Keller, Pauline: A Biography of Pauline, Halifax, NS: Formac Publishing, 1981, p. 4 Her father Ohyeatea (George Martin) was Mohawk. The couple lived with her parents until after their first child was born, in Mohawk custom. ==Education== George Johnson was educated at the Mohawk Institute, where he became fluent in English as well as Mohawk. ==Career== In 1838, Johnson was hired by the Reverend Adam Elliot as an interpreter. In 1840, he became interpreter for the Anglican mission at the Reserve. He became influential in both the English and Mohawk communities. ==Marriage and family== In 1853, Johnson married Emily Susanna Howells, a native of England whose family had immigrated to the United States in 1832. She was the sister-in-law of Reverend Elliot and a cousin of the American author William Dean Howells. Both families, and the Native community in general, opposed Johnson's interracial marriage to a white woman.Douglas Leighton, JOHNSON, GEORGE HENRY MARTIN (Onwanonsyshon), Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online The Mohawk resented that under Canadian law, Howells as Johnson's wife would gain status as a Native, with a right \\"to a portion of her band‚Äôs annuities and other benefits.\\" Under the Mohawk matrilineal kinship system, her children would have not fully belonged to the tribe as they would not be part of any clan. Reverend Elliot refused to perform the marriage ceremony, so the couple found another Anglican priest who would. The couple educated their four children to embrace both their Mohawk and English heritage. The Johnsons entertained leading figures of the time at their home of Chiefswood, which George had built in 1856 on his 225-acre estate. Their youngest daughter Pauline Johnson (1861-1913) became nationally known as a Canadian poet and performer known for representing her First Nations heritage. Her fame surpassed that of her father. His daughter Evelyn also became a poet. ==Later life== Johnson was elected as a hereditary chief of the Six Nations, succeeding his mother's brother, Henry Martin of the Wolf clan. The Mohawk had a matrilineal kinship system, in which descent and property passed through the woman's line, and his mother nominated him for the post. He later became friends with Jasper Tough Gilkison, Upper Canada Superintendent to the Six Nations. He was appointed government interpreter. Johnson served as a timber ranger, making efforts to control the theft of timber and sale of whiskey on the reserve by unscrupulous non-native men. He was badly beaten in 1865 for this, and attacked again in 1873, when he was shot. The sale of timber and whiskey was lucrative for whites. In 1884 Johnson died at his estate Chiefswood on the Grand River near Brantford. It has been listed as a National Historic Site and is the only Native mansion surviving from the pre-Confederation years. The house and summer kitchen wing were restored in the early 21st century. In addition, much of the open grounds have been restored since the late 20th century to the Ontario Tall Grass Prairie Meadows that were characteristic at the time of the family's residence and had plants used by the Mohawk for medicinal purposes.\\"Tall Grass Prairie\\" , Chiefswood National Historic Site Today less than five acres remain associated with the mansion.

The philosophy of the organisation is that if new facilities are made emission-free, then when existing plants and methods are phased out due to old age, society is left with emission-free facilities. The primary working areas include disposal, renewable energy, especially wind power, and new transportation fuels, including hydrogen and biofuel. ZERO is organised as foundation and was started by former activists and employees of Natur og Ungdom and Bellona. Funding sources include industrial associations and companies. ZERO is led by Marius Holm (director) and Erik Espeset (chairman). ==Issues== ZERO promotes new technology that enables emission-free energy solutions without harming the environment. Important issues are electric cars and chargers, carbon capture and storage (CCS), renewable energy, electrification of offshore installations, climate friendly construction and buildings and fossile free plastic. It also promotes biofuel as an alternative to fossil fuels. ZERO worked to establish an electricity certificate scheme to promote renewable energy in Norway and Sweden. The organisation also supported Hynor‚ÄîA chain of hydrogen fuel stations that would span the South Coast from Oslo to Stavanger. It promotes CO2-capture and storage from industrial plants and other industrial emission reductions and is a supporter of windmills. The organisation receives financial support from a wide range og public and private donors. Among others, the partners include Elkem, Siemens, Coca-Cola Norway, Scatec Solar, Tesla and Statoil. ZERO produces knowledge-based reports, writes op-eds and comments in the media and arranges various meetings, seminars and conferences. == The Zero conference == The biggest event is the annual ZERO conference (Zero-konferansen), that takes place in Oslo, Norway every november. The conference, established in 2006, is the largest climate conference in Norway with more than 1000 attendants. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kofi Annan, Jens Stoltenberg, Chelsea Clinton and former chairman of the IPCC Rajendra K.

Mobile local search satisfies the need to offer a mobile subscriber spontaneous access to near-position services and information such as businesses, products, events, restaurant, movie theatre or other local information.\\"Recommending Social Events from Mobile Phone Location Data\\", Daniele Quercia, et al., ICDM 2010 Mobile local search is the search and discovery of persons, places, and things within an identifiable space defined by distinct parameters. These parameters are evolving. Today they include social networks, individuals, cities, neighborhoods, landmarks, and actions that are relevant to the searcher's past, current, and future location. These parameters provide structure to vertically deep and horizontally broad data categories that can stand-alone or are combined to comprise searchable directories. Mobile local search is usually based on organized directories accessed through specialized search tools, rather than the web, although mobile local search often provides links to mobile (WAP) web sites. It is also an application of a location-based service. == Technology == Mobile local search involves in some cases GPS tracking, which, without prior consent, may cause privacy concerns. Furthermore, recent surveys expect merely 10% of mobile devices worldwide to be equipped with GPS chips in 2011. Alternatively, mobile local search can also be done without mobile operators and GPS systems involved. This is possible through access to the SS7 protocol, which mobile operators have. However, having access via the mobile operator is very hard since the mobile operators sell it at a premium rate, if at all. Although GPS- enabled devices are not prevalent yet, industry experts show that consumers are demanding mobile local search now, with an expected growth of 91% from 2007 to 2011. As a consequence, there is a gap in this opportunity that can be cleverly addressed by mobile operators and service providers with access to the SS7 layer. == Access methods == Mobile local search may be screen-based using the keypad and display on the mobile device, or voice-based using spoken commands that are interpreted by a speech recognition application. Screen- based search using the keypad to enter search terms into a form on the mobile screen is the most common access method today. It has the advantages of working in a noisy environment and avoiding speech interpretation problems. But the user has to enter search terms using a small keypad typical of most mobile devices, with results displayed on a small screen. Screen-based search may be awkward for people with coordination or vision handicaps. Screen-based search may be supported by a specialized application such as where.com running on the handset, by an SMS short code, or by a WAP or XHTML-MP website page on a remote server displayed by the handset browser. Although most search tools today are based on handset software, the trend seems to be towards web-based services. Also, when the consumer receives a reply to his search request, the most common way of delivery is via SMS. Voice-based search is becoming viable due to advances in speech recognition technology. It is useful for people who have difficulty using the small keypad, or who need to get information while driving. Spoken prompts guide the users through the local directory to find an entry. The service may include fallback to a live operator if the speech technology has difficulty understanding what they are looking for, or a 'silent agent' may assist the speech recognition software. Results may be spoken and/or delivered to the handset in SMS or MMS format, where they may be stored for future reference. Most often, voice-based search uses the voice channel to deliver the caller's utterance to a server-based search application. In some cases, a small application on the mobile device undertakes the first part of speech recognition, breaking down the utterance into a series of elementary components or 'phones', and then sending the phones over the data channel to a server application. Multimedia-based search will be prevalent as a hybrid form of both \\"voice-based\\" and \\"screen-based\\" search that will establish a time-memory tradeoff in the implementation process of fast-evolving mobile equipment. == Types of information == Mobile search content may include more location-based and more street-smart information on businesses, products, services, events, human relations and other local specifics,which require immediacy and spontaneity. Besides, the location-based content may be formulated by accumulative data mining on consumer behaviors and whereabouts, which may trigger privacy concerns,commercial come-ons and, if necessary, some legislative justifications. A search for businesses is the mobile equivalent of the printed Yellow Pages, but the search may focus on a small geographical area. For example, the caller may be looking for a nearby pharmacy or restaurant, or may want a local pizza delivery. The more advanced local search tools will vary the search radius depending on the type of business and the density of this type of business in the local area. For example, a caller looking for a coffee shop will probably want one within walking distance. If they are looking for a home furniture store they will expect to travel further. If they want a taxi, distance is not important: the taxi will come to them. A search for products is more specific than a search for businesses. The user is looking for a particular product and wants to find a local business that stocks this product. A full-function mobile local search service will go much further, particularly as smartphone penetration increases. For example, mobile users may want to find where a particular movie is playing, what restaurants are near the cinema, read reviews about those restaurants, and book reservations or buy movie tickets. They may want to hear about traffic conditions, the score from the local football game, the winning lottery number or where to go to vote. == Differences from Web search == As opposed to Web search, mobile local search requires more immediacy and street-smart knowledge and information, local events and driving directions. The technical difference from web-based search is that, whether using the keypad or voice commands, the caller has limited 'bandwidth'. They do not want to hear or scroll through long lists of results. They want to \\"quickly and unobtrusively\\" zero in on the type of local information they are looking for, due to privacy, safety and time pressure. Some of the advancements by the major portals in Internet search, such as Google's famous page-ranking scheme, do not apply in the wireless world since people are not searching for Web sites as much as answers to specific questions. 2006 showed a significant movement to the question- answer model. In this model answers are sent in reply to directory service queries similar to the nature of conventional 411 operators. AskMeNow, Ask.com and Bing.com all made efforts in this regard. == Business models == Mobile local search services are usually provided today by mobile carriers, directory enquiry providers, mobile messaging operators or Yellow Pages publishers. Behind these outlets, there is a growing network of agencies, distributors and software providers, some of whom are now starting to offer service direct to the public. Search giants, like Yahoo and Google, and big web publishers, such as Amazon.con and eBay have already embarked on this potentially lucrative market segment. The services are provided through a caller-pays, advertiser- pays or hybrid business model. In a caller-pays model, as with voice-based directory enquiry services, the caller pays each time they access the service. Caller-pays voice-based local mobile search services are common outside North America, but have been slow to emerge in the USA due to regulatory restrictions. In an advertiser-pays model, standard for screen-based search and starting to emerge with voice-based 'Free DA' services in North America, businesses pay to be placed early in the list of results, or pay each time a caller chooses to connect through. In hybrid models, advertising revenue lets the service provider offer reduced rates. As with TV, magazines and other media, mobile local search services will most likely continue to be offered under all three models, but the hybrid model may predominate. That is, callers will probably accept a limited amount of advertising (which they may actually find useful) in exchange for reduced prices, but may be less willing to use a free service where they are bombarded with advertising. The value to an advertiser will vary depending on their type of business, and may range from a dollar or less for a taxi or sandwich shop to well over ten dollars for a real-estate broker, attorney or debt consolidation service. Consultants forecast that the global industry will grow to over US$1 billion by 2010. == Service providers == The most direct way to find more about what is happening in the MoLo space is to check out the websites of the MoLo service providers and see what they are offering. There are many of them. Almost all mobile carriers have mobile local search offerings, including Verizon Wireless, AT&T;, Vodafone, T-Mobile, Sprint Nextel, Orange SA and so on. Many Directory Assistance providers also offer mobile local search, including free DA providers Jingle Networks and 1-800-San-Diego in the US, 118 118, Yell Group, Pages Jaunes, Seat Pagine Gialle, Eniro etc. in Europe, and many others. One of the more fully functional services is provided by Contact Center Americas in Colombia. The Yellow Pages Group in Canada provides one of the first voice- enabled local search services. ==See also== *Dashtop mobile *Local search (Internet) *Mobile platform ==References== ;Sources * Mobile Local Search Saturates Profit Over LBS Vendors ==External links== * Mobile Local Search 2010 - Insights and Expectations From Global Providers * Taking search to another level * New Opportunities on the World Wide Global Positioning Systems (GPS) - Market Size, Forecasts, Competitive Landscape * Category:Mobile telecommunications Category:Internet geolocation ","title":"Mobile local search"},{"id":"9133104","text":"Garmisch Three Bavarian Dances, Op. 27, is an orchestral work by Edward Elgar.

DAD is widely adopted AIMS which has been established in more than 35 countries worldwide in close cooperation with UNDP and respective governments. DAD provides country governments and development partners with a consolidated source of data on development projects across all donors, demonstrates \\"who is doing what, when and where\\" in managing foreign aid, enables harmonization of development projects with national priorities, facilitates management and coordination of development efforts in the country by and promotes results-driven decision-making and aid effectiveness. DAD serves /has served as the official government AIMS in Afghanistan, Armenia, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Comoros, Georgia, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Iraq (including Kurdistan Regional Government), Kazakhstan, Kenya, Maldives, Mauritania, Nigeria, Lesotho, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Russia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Somalia (including Somaliland), Solomon Islands, Tajikistan, Thailand, Ukraine, Vietnam, Yemen and Zambia. ==History== Originally known as the Donor Assistance Database, the DAD was re-branded as the Development Assistance Database on August 2, 2005. The first Donor Assistance Database was a PC system developed in the scope of the G7 Support Implementation Group project for Russia in 1996 to monitor aid assistance donated from the international community. The first Donor Assistance Database tracked 20,000 projects and over US$100 billion in Official Development Assistance delivered between 1991 and 2001. The DAD was then adapted as a tool for the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union to monitor development assistance from the international community. These first generation implementations include Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Tajikistan. Most of these implementations have taken place through a partnership between the software company Synergy International Systems, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). This partnership led to the signing of a Long Term Agreement in July, 2005. ==Functions and Capabilities == Online, offline and mobile collection of aid information ‚Äì DAD's customized data entry forms with validation control enable to submit and update aid information though web-based interface, in offline mode which is specifically for use in areas with limited or no Internet access as well as through smartphones and tablets. Sector Profile ‚Äì This functionality displays aggregate data related to particular sectors, including aid flows and projects in a given sector, donors involved, and results achieved. The Sector Profile can have all relevant information on sector portfolio performance, logistics etc. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E;) ‚Äì DAD enables to link aid projects with the government's policy priorities and national development strategies, and monitor progress in respect to targets/goals to track progress toward development results. Data visualization and analytics ‚Äì DAD offers a suite of web-based querying, analytics, visualization, and reporting tools - graphs, charts, tables, reports‚Äì for visualizing and interpreting aid information. Executive dashboard ‚Äì This decision-support tool displays data snapshots of aid flows (pledges, commitments, disbursements, and expenditures) and enables simultaneous viewing of all analytical outputs. Geographic Information System - DAD platform contains a Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping feature that allows to view geo-referenced data on project activities and results at various geographic levels and also to query or filter data on the web-based dynamic maps. Aid Effectiveness Portal ‚Äì DAD provides a range of knowledge sharing and collaboration tools to make aid information available to the public. Integration ‚Äì DAD can interface with relevant external and internal data sources in order to automate data exchange to enable effective flow of information and prevent duplication of effort and silos of information. Multi- lingual capability ‚Äì DAD can be adapted to the specific needs of a given country, including the localization of the software into the national language. == DAD Featured Projects Rwanda=== DAD Rwanda is Rwanda's official development aid (ODA) coordination system. It is used by the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MINECOFIN) to track and manage aid funds and development results across all major donors and NGOs. The system captures the national Donor Performance Assessment Framework (DPAF) mutual accountability framework, indicators and standard definitions and is used for annual Rwanda ODA Effectiveness reports. In 2010 an upgrade of the DAD resulted in establishing a new MTEF module with the view of systematically capturing forward-spending plans of Development Partners to feed into the MTEF process. DAD Rwanda was also integrated with Rwanda's SmartFMIS budgeting platform that resulted in more external funds flowing directly to Ministry of Planning for spending. Transparent governance has improved Rwanda's Business Environment rankings and Rwanda's data-driven model for aid management has been emulated by Burundi, Cameroon, Mauritania and Central African Republic. === Iraq === Launched in 2011 Iraq Development Management System (IDMS) is a web-based planning, budgeting and results tracking system used by the Iraq Ministry of Planning (MoP) to manage the entire cycle of government and donor-funded projects. IDMS covers 3000 projects with a total value of US$186 billion under the National Development Plan (NDP) 2010-2014. The system automates submission of new project proposals, annual and monthly budget preparation, advanced performance tracking, analysis, and reporting features. It uses both English and Arabic, and provides public access to data on key accountability metrics. IDMS was developed in partnership with UNDP, USAID-Tatweer, the EU and UNOPS. === Tsunami recovery systems === Following the devastating 2004 Asian tsunami with the support of UNDP, Development Assistance Database was established in tsunami affected countries - Sri Lanka, Maldives and Thailand and Indonesia, to track financial and technical assistance, as well as results related to tsunami recovery work. DAD Sri Lanka ‚Äì The Integrated National Development Information System (INDIS) was first introduced in Sri Lanka in 2005 following the devastating 2004 Asian tsunami to help the Government of Sri Lanka to track disaster needs, plan recovery programs and promote visibility and accountability in project spending and performance. INDIS allowed reconstruction agencies to report their projects and share information on objectives, funding sources, implementation partners and project progress online, with the ultimate goal of facilitating efficient aid coordination. DAD Indonesia - Synergy built the Recovery Aceh Nias (RAN) Database for the Government of Indonesia to support its coordination and management of the post-tsunami recovery effort. The RAN assisted the Government to align proposed projects with national reconstruction priorities, ensuring a coordinated plan for the delivery of aid. The RAN Database was the central tool for coordinating tsunami recovery activities and to date has tracked $3.7 billion in disbursements. Synergy was awarded the Innovative Government Technology Award in the Information Management category at the 2008 FutureGov Summit for the development of the Recovery Aceh Nias (RAN) Database installed for the BRR ‚Äì Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Agency of the Government of Indonesia. DAD Maldives - Synergy was contracted by the government of Maldives to implemented the Development Assistance Database (DAD) that was later linked with the National Recovery Reconstruction Plan (NRRP). This helped to implement a key tenet of the Paris Declaration by ‚Äúaligning‚Äù projects with national priorities as outlined in the NRRP and add the accountability mechanism. DAD Thailand - Synergy customized the DAD for the Thailand International Cooperation Agency located within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Launched in 2005, DAD Thailand, has significantly improved coordination and monitoring of the long-term international support to tsunami recovery in Thailand. == DAD Community of Practice == The Development Assistance Database (DAD) Community of Practice (CoP) is a global forum of practitioners who share a common commitment to advancing development effectiveness through the application of DAD. The major event of the DAD CoP is a biennial conference that brings together participants representing governments, aid agencies, civil society organizations, think-tanks, and the private sector. The conference centers on a workshop that features case studies in implementing DAD to improve management of development data. The DAD CoP currently has over 80 members from about 20 countries, including Afghanistan, Armenia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Comoros, India, Iraq, Kenya, Lesotho, Mauritania, Moldova, Mozambique, Namibia, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, and Yemen. The International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) also participates in the DAD CoP. Three DAD CoP forums have been organized so far - DAD CoP 2014, Nairobi, Kenya, DAD CoP 2011, Yerevan, Armenia and DAD CoP 2009 Yerevan, Armenia. == See also == Synergy International Systems ==External links== *Synergy International Systems, Inc. ==References== Category:United Nations documents Category:Business software ","title":"Development Assistance Database"},{"id":"9133138","text":"Sir John James Briscoe, 1st Baronet JP, DL (6 December 1836 ‚Äì 1 May 1919) was a British baronet.

Note the traces of 1938 upgrade on pillars Wooden bridges at the site of fortified Novospassky monastery existed since 16th century. The last wooden causeway was demolished in 1910. In 1911, the city built a triple-span arched bridge, similar to other pre-revolutionary Moscow bridges. Spans were 40.54, 46.99 and 40.54 meters long, 21.2 meters wide (4 lanes, including two tram lines). Each span was supported by 14 arches, 3.7 meters high for middle span, 3.3 meters high for side spans. Steel deck was paved with timbers. In 1937‚Äì1938, the bridge was reconstructed to the design by Yu.F.Werner (structural engineering), N.B.Sokolov and Yakovlev brothers (architectural design). They raised the deck by 2.7 meters, which increased water clearance 8.6 meters high, 30 meters wide (for heavy barge traffic after completion of Moscow Canal). This also enabled separating embankment and bridge traffic in two levels (street-level throughways under main deck), total length with ramps reached 502 meters. Timber pavement was replaced with concrete and asphalt.Bridges of Moscow, 2004, p.67 ==Reconstruction of 2000== In 2000, the bridge was rebuilt with complete replacement of deck structure. Arches were replaced with a simple steel girder set covered with orthotropic deck, 24.4 meters wide. The architects tried to mimic the old outline with arch-like skirts; these look inadequately lightweight and are nowhere near the original. The structure itself is lightweight, excessively vibrating when trams pass by. Build quality is questionable. As soon as 2003, the granite-clad shoreside pillars and ramps were covered with rusty spots showing fast corrosion right under the surface.

Spanish censuses record that as much as one- third of the inhabitants of the city of Zamboanga possess varying degrees of Iberian and Hispanic-American admixture.Jagor, F√´dor, et al. (1870). The Former Philippines thru Foreign Eyes In addition to this, select cities such as Iloilo, Bacolod, Dumaguete, Cebu, and Cavite, which were home to military fortifications and/or commercial ports during the Spanish era also hold sizable mestizo communities.Institute for Human Genetics, University of California San Francisco (2015). \\"\\"Self-identified East Asian nationalities correlated with genetic clustering, consistent with extensive endogamy. Individuals of mixed East Asian-European genetic ancestry were easily identified; we also observed a modest amount of European genetic ancestry in individuals self-identified as Filipinos\\" The Zamboangue√±o nation constitute an authentic and distinct ethnolinguistic identity because of their coherent cultural and historical heritage, most notably Chavacano, that distinguishes them from neighboring ethnolinguistic nations. ==Ethnogenesis== The flag of the short-lived Republic of Zamboanga. People from other ethnolinguistic nations came to Zamboanga when the construction of the present-day Fort Pilar began. The colonial Spanish government ordered the construction of a military fort to guard off the city from Moro pirates and slave raiders of Sulu. Labourers from Panay, Cavite, Ceb√∫, Bohol, Negros and other islands were brought to the city to help build the fort. Eventually, these people settled in the city to live alongside and intermarried with other ethnolinguistic nations, primarily among the Subanon ethnic group, whose entire ethnicity descended from one clan is a grand claim. (from the Royal ethnic lineage of Macombong and Tongab whose father is Shariff Bungsu of Bruneian royalty and mother is Princess Nayac, the daughter of the late King of Kingdom of Jambangan, Datu Timuay of the Subanon people who are the ancestors together with other ethnolinguistic nation - the Lutao,). Together, they would form the nucleus of the present-day Zamboangue√±o people. To this nucleus were added the descendants of laborers from Iloilo City in Panay and of soldiers from New SpainLetter from Fajardo to Felipe III From Manila, August 15, 1620.(From the Spanish Archives of the Indies) (\\"The infantry does not amount to two hundred men, in three companies. If these men were that number and Spaniards, it would not be so bad; but, although I have not seen them, because they have not yet arrived here, I am told that they are, as at other times, for the most part,boys, mestizos, and mulattoes, with some Indians. There is no little cause for regret in the great sums that re√´nforcements of such men waste for, and cost, your Majesty. I cannot see what betterment there will be until your Majesty shall provide it, since I do not think, that more can be done in Nueva Espa√±a, although the viceroy must be endeavoring to do so, as he is ordered.\\") and Peru.\\"SECOND BOOK OF THE SECOND PART OF THE CONQUESTS OF THE FILIPINAS ISLANDS, AND CHRONICLE OF THE RELIGIOUS OF OUR FATHER, ST. AUGUSTINE\\" (Zamboanga City History) \\"He (Governor Don Sebast√≠an Hurtado de Corcuera) brought a great re√´nforcement of soldiers, many of them from Per√∫, as he made his voyage to Acapulco from that kingdom.\\" Through intermarriage, Visayans, Hispano-Americans and with the Spanish, they created a new culture which gradually developed a distinct identity‚Äîthe Zamboangue√±os (Zamboangue√±o: mag√°/man√° Zamboangue√±os; Spanish: Zamboangue√±os). Furthermore, because these people come from different islands and even nations and spoke different languages, they together developed a new pidgin language called Chavacano. Chavacano then evolved into a full-fledged Spanish-based creole to become the lingua franca of Zamboanga City and then the official language of the Republic of Zamboanga. ==Culture== The character of the Zamboangue√±o people are unique as we can say for their kinship family system, love for one's cultural heritage, propensity for extravagance, fiestas and siestas, as well as aristocratic behaviour. While their social lives usually revolve around religious practices, the tradition of the bantayanon and fondas, includes their bailes the vals, regodon and paso doble. They are mostly devout Roman Catholics. The Zamboangue√±os of Basilan have, of late, also acquired more globalized tastes in cuisine, fashion, and customs. ===Language=== The extent of Chavacano speakers in Mindanao. Chavacano is the native language of the Zamboangue√±o people. A conglomeration of 90% traditional Spanish and 10% influences from other Romance languages such as Portuguese, Italian and French, Native American such as Nahuatl, Ta√≠no, Quechua et al. and Austronesian languages such as Binisaya (mainly Cebuano and Ilonggo), Subanon, Taus≈´g, Yakan, Sama and Malay. ===Courtship etiquette=== Zamboangue√±o courtship traditions are elaborate and regulated by a long list of required social graces. For example, a perfectly respectable Zamboangue√±o gentleman (caballero) would not sit unless permitted to do so by the woman's parents, he then had to endure questions pertaining to his lineage, credentials and occupation. Finally, the courtship curfew and the need to cultivate the goodwill of all the members of the woman's family were paramount considerations before any headway could be made in pursuing a Zamboangue√±o se√±orita‚Äôs hand in marriage. ===Dance=== A Zamboangue√±o woman performing the jota zamboangue√±a dance. Zamboangue√±o songs and dances are derived primarily from Iberian performances. Specifically, the jota zamboangue√±a, a Zamboangue√±o version of the quick-stepping flamenco with bamboo clappers in lieu of Spanish castanets, are regularly presented during fiestas and formal tertulias or other Zamboangue√±o festivities. ===Clothing=== Likewise, Zamboangue√±o traditional costumes are closely associated with Spanish formal dress. Men wear close-necked jackets as they called camiseta Zamboangue√±a, de bast√≥n pants, and European style shoes, complete with the de-rigueur bigotillos (mustache). Zamboangue√±o women claim ownership of the mascota, a formal gown with a fitting bodice, her shoulders draped demurely by a luxuriously embroidered, though stiff, pa√±uelo and fastened at the breast by a brooch or a medal. The skirt tapers down from the waist but continues on to an extended trail called the cola. The cola may be held on one hand as the lady walks around, or it may likewise by pinned on the waist or slipped up a cord (belt) that holds the dainty abanico or purse. The traditional Zamboangue√±o dress has been limited to formal functions, replaced by the more common shirt, denim jeans, and sneakers for men, and shirts, blouses, skirts or pants, and heeled shoes for women. ===Festivals=== There are several important events of the festival that can be witnessed during Holy Week (Chavacano/Spanish: Semana Santa). These include watching films (mag√° pel√≠cula) about Jesus and his teachings, visitaiglesias, processions, novenas and the climbing and praying of the Stations of the Cross (Estaciones de la Cruz) in Mt. Pulong Bato, Fiesta de Pilar (Spanish: Fiesta del Pilar), a festivity in honour of Our Lady of the Pillar (Zamboangue√±o: Nuestro Se√±ora de Pilar; Spanish: Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar) and Zamboanga Day (D√≠a de Zamboanga) and Day of the Zamboangue√±os (D√≠a del mag√° Zamboangue√±o) which is celebrated every 15 August every year for the foundation of Zamboanga and ethnogenesis of the Zamboangue√±o people on 15 of August 1635. Zamboangue√±o celebrate Christmas in so many unique ways such as the villancicos/aguinaldos o pastores this also includes the D√≠a de Navide√±a and Nochebuena, fiestas, v√≠speras, Diana, Misa, mag√° juego, processions and feasting. ===Cuisine=== Zamboangue√±o cuisine includes in its repertoire curacha, calamares, tamales, loc√≥n, cangrejos, paella, estofado, arroz a la valenciana, caldo de vaca/cerdo/pollo, puchero, caldo de arroz, lech√≥n, jamonadas, endulzados, embutido, adobo, afritadas, menudo, caldereta, jumb√°, flan de leche and many more. ==Notable persons== There are Zamboangue√±os who are famous for their fields of endeavor, especially in music, entertainment, sports, and politics. These are the following: *Frank L. Anderson (born January 19, 1957) is an American animator, director, author, and musician. *Alyssa Alano is a Filipina - Australian film and TV actress.

Muncer was a useful middle or later order right-handed batsman and a spin bowler who began by bowling occasional leg breaks and googlies for Middlesex in the 1930s but converted to off-spin when he changed counties to Glamorgan. Muncer's first-class cricket career divides into two almost exact halves. For eight seasons with Middlesex, starting in 1933, he was regarded as a batsman who bowled infrequently, and though he played regularly in 1934 and 1935, he was a fringe first eleven player for his remaining seasons with the county. In eight seasons, he made only just over 2000 runs and took 23 wickets. The eight seasons were divided by the Second World War, in which he was a prisoner of war in the Far East and worked on the Burma-Siam railway.Wisden 1983, p. 1251. But recruited by Glamorgan captain Wilf Wooller on special registration in 1947 and converted to off-spin, Muncer proved both a reliable batsman and a penetrative bowler. In his first season with the Welsh county, he scored 689 runs and took 107 wickets, including nine for 97 in an innings against Surrey at Cardiff, which was more wickets in an innings than he had taken in a full season before. The following year, 1948, Muncer's 159 wickets played a large part in winning the County Championship for Glamorgan for the first time, and he finished high up the national bowling averages. Against Essex at Brentwood, he took nine wickets for 62 runs in an innings and 15 for 161 in the match, and these remained the best innings and match figures of his career. He also took 15 wickets in the match against Sussex at Swansea. Over the next four seasons, Muncer took more than 100 wickets each year except in 1950, when Glamorgan set a record with nine matches that failed to be decided even on first innings because of the weather. And his batting continued to develop, with one century in every season from 1950 to 1953 and, in 1952, a tally of 1097 runs to go with 105 wickets for the all-rounder's double. In 1953, his bowling was hampered by injury, and Jim McConnon became the county's main off- spin bowler. He retired after the 1954 season, in which he was awarded a benefit, having played eight seasons in all for Glamorgan. After his playing career ended he returned to Lord's and was head coach of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) from 1964 until he retired in 1978.Cricketer, November 1978, p. 30. In 1971 he was awarded a second benefit, jointly with Harry Sharp, former Middlesex batsman and then scorer, who was his assistant head coach at MCC. ==References== * Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1934 to 1955 editions * CricketArchive Category:1913 births Category:1982 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:Middlesex cricketers Category:Glamorgan cricketers Category:Players cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:Burma Railway prisoners Category:North v South cricketers ","title":"Len Muncer"},{"id":"9133277","text":"The Offbeat Of Avenues was the thirteenth album released by The Manhattan Transfer on August 13, 1991 by Columbia Records.

Bhai Sati Das, Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Dyal Das were all executed at kotwali (police-station) in the Chandni Chowk area of Delhi, under the express orders of emperor Aurangzeb just prior to the martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur. Bhai Sati Das was executed by the means of being wrapped in cotton wool soaked in oil and set on fire. == Biography  Birth === Bhai Sati Das belonged to the Chhibber Hindu Brahmin family. He belonged to the ancient village of Karyala, about ten kilometres from Chakwal on the road to the Katas Raj Temple Complex, in the Jhelum District in Punjab (Pakistan). Bhai Mati Das was his older brother and Bhai Sati Das was the son of Hira Nand, a disciple of Guru Har Gobind, under whom he had fought in many battles. Hira Nand was the grandson of Lakhi Das, the son of the Bhai Pairagh. === Service of Guru Tegh Bahadur === During the time after Guru Har Krishan's death at Delhi and the uncertainty of the next Guru, the Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Sati Das sometimes find mention in being present looking for the Guru or directly after when Baba Makhan Shah Labana found Guru Tegh Bahadur at the village of Bakala where the new Guru was then residing. The Guru entrusted financial activity to Bhai Mati Das thus he is sometimes given the name Diwan Mati Das whereas, according to Bhatt Vahi Talauda, Bhai Sati Das served Guru Tegh Bahadur as a cook for the Guru. The two brothers accompanied Guru Teg Bahadur during his 2-year stay at Assam. Guru Tegh Bahadur bought a hillock near the village of Makhowal five miles north of Kiratpur and established a new town, Chakk Nanaki now named as Anandpur Sahib (the abode of bliss) where Mati Das and Sati Das were also present. Bhai Sati Das was known to have a great understanding of the Persian language and according to some sources taught the language to the young Gobind Rai (Guru Gobind Singh). The Guru's eastern tours Bhai Sati Das and Bhai Mati Das were present in the Guru's eastern tours starting in August 1665 including the tours of Saifabad and Dhamtan (Bangar) where they were arrested perhaps because of the influence of Dhir Mal, or the Ulemas and orthodox Brahmins. The Guru was sent to Delhi and detained for 1 month. After being freed December 1665 he continued his tour and Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Sati Das were again in his company particularly at Dacca, and Malda. === Guru's Arrest=== Red Fort at Chandni Chowk Delhi In 1675 the Guru was summoned by Emperor Aurangzeb to Delhi to convert to Islam. Aurangzeb was very happy that all he had to do was covert one man and the rest of the Brahmins from Kashmir, Kurukshetra, Hardwar, and Beneras would follow suit. The Guru left for Delhi on his own accord but was arrested at Malikpur Rangharan near Ropar. While the Guru was traveling towards Delhi his company at this time consisted of his most devoted Sikhs and comprised Bhai Dayala, Bhai Udai, and Bhai Jaita (Rangretta) as well as Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Sati Das. After visiting a few places where large crowds of devotees visited the Guru sent Bhai Jaita and Bhai Udai to go to Delhi so they can access the information and report it back to him and report it to Anandpur as well. After being arrested Guru Tegh Bahadur was taken to Sirhind from which he was sent to Delhi in an iron cage. At Delhi, the Guru and his five companions were taken into the council chamber of the Red Fort. The Guru was asked numerous questions on religion, Hinduism, Sikhism and Islam, such as why he was sacrificing his life for people that wear Janeu and Tilak when he himself was a Sikh upon which the Guru answered that the Hindus were powerless and weak against tyranny, they had come to the abode of Guru Nanak as refuge, and that with the same logic he would have sacrificed his life for Muslims as well. On the Guru's emphatic refusal to abjure his faith, he was asked why he was called Teg Bahadur (gladiator or Knight of the Sword; before this, his name had been Tyag Mal). Bhai Mati Das immediately replied that the Guru had won the title by inflicting a heavy blow on the imperial forces at the young age of fourteen. Guru Tegh Bahadur was reprimanded for his breach of etiquette and outspokenness and the Guru and his companions were ordered to be imprisoned and tortured until they agreed to embrace Islam. === Guru's Martyrdom === On November 11, 1675 large crowds gathered to see the Guru and the executioners were called to the kotwali (police-station) near the Sunehri Masjid in the Chandni Chowk and the Guru who was kept in an iron cage and all the three of his companions were moved to the place of the execution. Mati Das, Dyal Das and Sati Das were then tortured and executed.  Martyrdom of Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Dyal Das  Bhai Mati Das who was the first to be martyred was made to stand erect between two posts and double headed saw was placed on his head and moved across from head to the loins. Seeing this Dyal Das abused the Emperor and his courtiers for this infernal act. He was tied up like a round bundle and thrown into a huge cauldron of boiling oil. He was roasted alive into a block of charcoal. No sign of grief was shown by the disciple of the Guru and the Guru also witnessed all this savagery with divine calm.  Martyrdom of Bhai Sati Das  After the martyrdom of Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Dyal Das, Bhai Sati Das moved towards the Guru with folded hands and asked for his blessings, saying that he was happy to achieve martyrdom. The Guru blessed him telling that they must resign themselves cheerfully to the will of the Lord. He praised him for his lifelong single-minded devotion to him and his cause. With tears in his eyes, he bade him farewell saying his sacrifice would occupy an abiding place in history. Sati Das touched the Guru's feet, and came to his place. Bhai Sati Das was tied to a pole and wrapped in cotton fibre. He was then set on fire by the executioner. He remained calm and peaceful and kept uttering Waheguru Gurmantar, while fire consumed his body.  Martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur  Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib, Delhi Early next morning Guru Tegh Bahadur was beheaded by an executioner called Jalal-ud-din Jallad, who belonged to the town of Samana in present-day Punjab. The spot of the execution was under a banyan tree (the trunk of the tree and well near-by where he took a bath are still preserved), opposite the Sunheri Masjid near the Kotwali in Chandni Chowk where he was lodged as a prisoner, on November 11, 1675. His head was carried by Bhai Jaita, a disciple of the Guru, to Anandpur where the nine-year-old Guru Gobind Singh cremated it(The gurdwara at this spot is also called Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib). The body, before it could be quartered, was stolen under the cover of darkness by Lakhi Shah Vanjara, another disciple who carried it in a cart of hay and cremated it by burning his hut, at this spot, the Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib stands today. Later on, the Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib, was built at Chandni Chowk at the site of Guru's martyrdom. == Legacy == The Bhai Mati Das Sati Das Museum was built in honor of Bhai Mati Das and Bhai Sati Das in Delhi opposite of Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib, Chandni Chowk the spot where they were martyred. == See also == * Guru Tegh Bahadur * Guru Gobind Singh * Bhai Mati Das * Bhai Dayala == References == *http://www.searchsikhism.com/mati.html *Sikh History Book 5 by Kartar Singh, Hemkunt Press, New Delhi Category:Sikh martyrs Category:Punjabi people Category:History of Punjab Category:People executed for refusing to convert to Islam Category:Executed Indian people Category:People executed by the Mughal Empire Category:People from Jhelum District Category:17th-century executions in India Category:1621 births Category:1675 deaths Category:Victims of human rights abuses Category:People executed by India by decapitation hi:‡§≠‡§æ‡§à ‡§Æ‡§§‡§ø‡§¶‡§æ‡§∏ ","title":"Bhai Sati Das"},{"id":"9133309","text":"Gaston Salmon (5 March 1878 ‚Äì 30 April 1917) was a Belgian √©p√©e, foil, and sabre fencer.

He was the sport's 29th yokozuna, and the last yokozuna in Osaka sumo. ==Career== He was born . In the fall of 1909, he joined Dewanoumi stable. He made his professional debut in June 1910 using the shikona name . However, he was punched by Kyushuzan Juro and escaped from Tokyo sumo in May 1912. He did not abandon the idea of becoming a wrestler and moved to Osaka sumo. In January 1913 he began using the ring name , before changing it to Miyagiyama Fukumatsu in May 1914. Miyagiyama reached the top makuuchi division in 1916 and he was promoted to ≈çzeki after only 2 tournaments. In January 1920, he won his first championship with an 8-1-1draw record. In March 1921, he fought against wrestlers in Tokyo sumo and defeated sekiwake Genjiyama, ≈çzeki Tsunenohana, yokozuna ≈ånishiki and Kyushuzan. Around this time he reconciled with Kyushuzan. In June 1921, he won the championship with an 8‚Äì2 record. In January 1922, he won the championship with a perfect 10‚Äì0 record. After winning two consecutive championships, he was awarded a yokozuna licence. He was absent from two tournaments in 1923 due to a phlegmon on the middle finger of his right hand. In January 1926, he won the championship with a 9‚Äì1 record. In 1927, Osaka Sumo Association disbanded and its wrestlers merged with Tokyo sumo. At that time, Osaka sumo's level was very low and he was not considered to be strong enough. However, he felt he had to save the honor of Osaka sumo as yokozuna. Although his strength had already declined, he fought tooth and nail and won 2 championships in Tokyo sumo as part of the Osaka contingent of wrestlers. The first of these, in January 1927, was the first tournament to be held under the auspices of the Dai Nihon Ozumo Kyokai (now the Japan Sumo Association). Considering that he had been retained as a yokozuna simply because there was no precedent for demoting one and to allow Osaka sumo to save face, it was regarded as a sensational result. After his retirement, he became the 6th head coach of Shibatayama stable. The stable was closed after his death. Afterward, the 62nd yokozuna ≈ånokuni became the 12th holder of the Shibatayama name and he opened the modern Shibatayama stable. == Osaka sumo top division record == *Osaka sumo existed independently for many years before merging with Tokyo sumo in 1926. 1‚Äì2 tournaments were held yearly, though the actual time they were held was often erratic. *Championships for the best record in a tournament were not recognized or awarded in Osaka sumo before its merger with Tokyo sumo, and the unofficial championships above are historically conferred.

The school's academic facilities include a library housing 100,000 books and magazines, an electronic library, 100 classrooms with multi-media equipment, a lecture hall, a 700-people auditorium, an information center, a 300 m2 greenhouse supported by NASA and China Space Center. The school has two standard soccer fields, six tennis courts, 16 basketball courts, a 400-meter track and a gymnasium for volleyball, dancing and ping-pong. ==History== Beijing 101 Middle School was founded in 1946. The school was founded on the war-torn Zhangjiakou, a town in the nearby Hebei Province. Soon after 101's foundation, the Chinese Civil War begun and both students and teachers were forced to move. After two years of moving, the school entered Beijing City and built its first permanent campus in Xiyuan, Haidian District. This moving is known as \\"the Long March of 101\\". In the first 20 years of its history, the school was only open to children of the country's top-ranking officers. Zhou Enlai, the former premier of China, once visited the school and encouraged students to achieve their dreams at 101. After Mao Zedong commented on 101's discriminate admission policies in 1964, the school was opened to all students disregard of their family backgrounds. Jiang Zemin, the former General Secretary of Communist Party and President of China, and Li Peng, the former Chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC), both congratulated the school and wrote couplets when the school celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1996. In 2003, premier Wen Jiabao visited the school and encouraged the students to carry on the school's rich traditions. During the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, 101 was chosen to hold the Youth Camp of the XXIX Olympia. ===Early history=== * March 1946, Zhangjiakou Municipal School, the prototype of Beijing 101, was founded by the People's Liberation Army in Hebei Province. * September 1946ÔºåZhangjiakou Municipal School, Municipal Girls' School, Huimin Middle School evacuated from Zhangjiakou. The three schools moved across Taihang Mountains, arrived at Jianping County (now called Pingshan County), Hebei Province. * November 1946, the three schools were united and named as Jin Cha Ji Frontline United Middle School (Chinese: ÊôãÂØüÂÜÄËæπÂå∫ËÅîÂêà‰∏≠Â≠¶). * January 1948, the United Middle School moved to the suburb of Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei Province. * August 1948, the Xingzhi Middle School was incorporated by the United Middle School, and the new school was named as Huabei Yucai Middle School (Chinese: ÂçéÂåóËÇ≤Êâç‰∏≠Â≠¶). * January 1949, Huabei Yucai Middle School moved to Wanping, a small town southwest of Beijing City. * May 1949, Huabei Yucai became a middle school affiliated to Peking Normal University. * 1951, based on the agreement of Zhou Enlai, the school built its first permanent campus in the Old Summer Palace. * 1955, the school was renamed as Beijing 101 Middle School according to the suggestion of Guo Moruo, a famous Chinese poet and author. ===Principals of 101=== { border=1  Name  Position  Duration -  Renchu Hao  School founder  March 1946 - June 1952 -  Yizhi Wang  Second principal  July 1952 - January 1982 -  Zhanwu Liu  Principal  January 1982 - August 1984 -  Rongxing Gu  Principal  September 1984 - February 1992 -  Yulong Wang  Principal  March 1992 - March 1999 -  Han Guo  Principal  March 1999 ‚Äì present } Yizhi Wang, the second principal, is the most respected principal in 101's history. As a principal who had led the school for almost 30 years, through both Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution, Wang made substantial contributions to the school and its students. ==Academics== Since 1946, Beijing 101 Middle School has been one of the best middle schools in China. Before the school was opened to society based on the non-discriminate admission policy, 101's special position had brought the school the best educational resources. Before the Education Department called for a change in public schools' admission standards several years ago, 101's student body composed of the top 5% of applicants from each year. Over 80% of the students are enrolled in the country's key universities. 98% of 101's graduates get into colleges or universities each year, almost the highest rate in mainland China. In 2008, the liberal arts department sent 99.3% of its students to universities all around the world, the highest rate in several years.http://www.beijing101.com Unlike most schools in mainland China, 101 runs a very intense independent study program. Over 10% of the students have independent science programs that might take them more than a year to finish. In 2006, an asteroid was named after Zhongyuechen, a student at Beijing 101 High School, due to her newest biology discovery. The asteroid is now known as 21725 Zhongyuechen. 101 is also one of the few public schools in China which offers courses for more than five foreign languages. ==Activities== The school's Jinfan Orchestra 101 was chosen as the Olympic Youth Camp of the Beijing XXIX Olympia. Students from more than 50 countries spent their Olympic summer at 101. Beijing 101 Middle School was also the last leg of Beijing XXIX Olympic's torch relay. The torch was ignited in Olympia, Greece, after 129 days of relay, passing 19 countries all around the world. The torch reached Beijing 101 Middle School and ended its journey in front of 101's Lecture Hall. Beijing 101 Middle School also hosted the 2007 Annual Summit of International School Connection (ISC). The school has built a relationship with the Olympic Delegation of Montenegro, a new country on the Balkan Peninsula. The school's orchestra, Golden Sail (also known as Jinfan or ÈáëÂ∏Ü), has travelled around the world in the last ten years. In August 2005, Golden Sail Orchestra won the first place of 34th International Youth Music Festival in Vienna, Austria. The school also has a girls' volleyball team which won second place in a national tournament in 2006. 101 holds a lot of speeches every year. Barry Marshall, the 2005 Nobel Medicine Prize winner, Kai-Fu Lee, the head of Google China, and dozens of scientists and scholars have made speeches at 101 in the last three years. ==Notable alumni== * Zeng Qinghong, former CPC Politburo Standing Committee member (2002‚Äì2007) and Vice-President (2003‚Äì2008) of China. * Li Tieying, vice-president of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. * Shi Guangnan, musician, known as the \\"People's Musician\\". * Liu Qi, former Mayor (1999‚Äì2003) of Beijing, President of Beijing 2008 Olympic Organizing Committee. * Liu Jingmin, vice-mayor of Beijing, vice president of Beijing 2008 Olympic Organizing Committee. * Cui Yongyuan, talk show host of China Central Television. * Zhang Meiying, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). * Xie Fei, film director, winner of the Gold Bear Prize for Best Film at the Berlin International Film Festival. * Liao Hui, vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), director of State Department's Hong Kong, Macau Affairs Branch. * Carma Hinton, documentary filmmaker and professor. * Hu Shuli, editor-in-chief of Caixin Media. * Wu Shaozu, former director of the National Sports Committee. * Bai Keming, former first-in-charge of Hainan province, president of CCP Hainan Branch. * Wen Xingyu, actor, best known for his performance in I Love My Family (ÊàëÁà±ÊàëÂÆ∂Ôºâ. *Zhang Lin, swimmer. * Song Yuqi, singer, member of (G)I-dle *Liu He, Vice Premier of China.

The concept of uniform convexity was first introduced by James A. Clarkson in 1936. == Definition == A uniformly convex space is a normed vector space such that, for every 0<\\\\varepsilon \\\\leq 2 there is some \\\\delta>0 such that for any two vectors with \\\\x\\\\ = 1 and \\\\y\\\\ = 1, the condition :\\\\x-y\\\\\\\\geq\\\\varepsilon implies that: :\\\\left\\\\\\\\frac{x+y}{2}\\\\right\\\\\\\\leq 1-\\\\delta. Intuitively, the center of a line segment inside the unit ball must lie deep inside the unit ball unless the segment is short. == Properties == * The unit sphere can be replaced with the closed unit ball in the definition. Namely, a normed vector space X is uniformly convex if and only if for every 0<\\\\varepsilon\\\\le 2 there is some \\\\delta>0 so that, for any two vectors x and y in the closed unit ball (i.e. \\\\x\\\\ \\\\le 1 and \\\\y\\\\ \\\\le 1 ) with \\\\x-y\\\\ \\\\ge \\\\varepsilon , one has \\\\left\\\\{\\\\frac{x+y}{2}}\\\\right\\\\ \\\\le 1-\\\\delta (note that, given \\\\varepsilon , the corresponding value of \\\\delta could be smaller than the one provided by the original weaker definition). The \\"if\\" part is trivial. Conversely, assume now that X is uniformly convex and that x,y are as in the statement, for some fixed 0<\\\\varepsilon\\\\le 2 . Let \\\\delta_1\\\\le 1 be the value of \\\\delta corresponding to \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{3} in the definition of uniform convexity. We will show that \\\\left\\\\\\\\frac{x+y}{2}\\\\right\\\\\\\\le 1-\\\\delta , with \\\\delta=\\\\min\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{6},\\\\frac{\\\\delta_1}{3}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} . If \\\\x\\\\\\\\le 1-2\\\\delta then \\\\left\\\\\\\\frac{x+y}{2}\\\\right\\\\\\\\le\\\\frac{1}{2}(1-2\\\\delta)+\\\\frac{1}{2}=1-\\\\delta and the claim is proved. A similar argument applies for the case \\\\y\\\\\\\\le 1-2\\\\delta , so we can assume that 1-2\\\\delta<\\\\x\\\\,\\\\y\\\\\\\\le 1 . In this case, since \\\\delta\\\\le\\\\frac{1}{3} , both vectors are nonzero, so we can let x'=\\\\frac{x}{\\\\x\\\\} and y'=\\\\frac{y}{\\\\y\\\\} . We have \\\\x'-x\\\\=1-\\\\x\\\\\\\\le 2\\\\delta and similarly \\\\y'-y\\\\\\\\le 2\\\\delta , so x' and y' belong to the unit sphere and have distance \\\\x'-y'\\\\\\\\ge\\\\x-y\\\\-4\\\\delta\\\\ge\\\\varepsilon-\\\\frac{4\\\\varepsilon}{6}=\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon}{3} . Hence, by our choice of \\\\delta_1 , we have \\\\left\\\\\\\\frac{x'+y'}{2}\\\\right\\\\\\\\le 1-\\\\delta_1 . It follows that \\\\left\\\\\\\\frac{x+y}{2}\\\\right\\\\\\\\le\\\\left\\\\\\\\frac{x'+y'}{2}\\\\right\\\\+\\\\frac{\\\\x'-x\\\\+\\\\y'-y\\\\}{2}\\\\le 1-\\\\delta_1+2\\\\delta\\\\le 1-\\\\frac{\\\\delta_1}{3}\\\\le 1-\\\\delta and the claim is proved. * The Milman‚ÄìPettis theorem states that every uniformly convex Banach space is reflexive, while the converse is not true. * Every uniformly convex Banach space is a Radon-Riesz space, that is, if \\\\\\\\{f_n\\\\\\\\}_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} is a sequence in a uniformly convex Banach space which converges weakly to f and satisfies \\\\f_n\\\\ \\\\to \\\\f\\\\, then f_n converges strongly to f , that is, \\\\f_n - f\\\\ \\\\to 0 . * A Banach space X is uniformly convex if and only if its dual X^* is uniformly smooth. * Every uniformly convex space is strictly convex. Intuitively, the strict convexity means a stronger triangle inequality \\\\x+y\\\\ < \\\\x\\\\+\\\\y\\\\ whenever x,y are linearly independent, while the uniform convexity requires this inequality to be true uniformly. == Examples == * Every Hilbert space is uniformly convex. * Every closed subspace of a uniformly convex Banach space is uniformly convex. * Hanner's inequalities imply that Lp spaces (1 are uniformly convex. * Conversely, L^\\\\infty is not uniformly convex. ==See also== * Modulus and characteristic of convexity * Uniformly convex function * Uniformly smooth space == References == * . * . * * * Lindenstrauss, Joram and Benyamini, Yoav.

The station was launched in 1974. The three original founders of CKOB were Marty Burns, Terry Sammon and James Donnohue. CKOB was sold to Jamie Pole in 1981. Richard Armitage (program director) managed early 1980s announcers such as Bob Rose (sports director), Rick Niemi (music director), Gerard \\"Gerry\\" Gava and Brother Lee Nelson as they entertained the Ottawa Valley region with an assortment of cross-country, middle-of-the-road and adult contemporary music. The station was semi- automated between midnight and six in the morning playing back pre-recorded music from a simple reel-to-reel logger machine running at 3/32 inches per second. Live local lunch time phone-in shows such as In the Mayor's Chair, hosted by then news director Terry Horner or Derek Neil put the listener directly in touch with the presiding mayor (Audrey Green) in an open forum to discuss topics of the day. Cathy Warren hosted the daily talk show. In 1984, Jamie Pole launched sister station CKOA in Arnprior, with 250 watts, and one of the most modern solid state transmitters available at the time. The transmitter was the first of its type to be used in the Ottawa Valley and was 100% Canadian made. Peter DeWolf managed the new Arnprior station. The two station POLE network was then known \\"Ottawa Valley Radio\\". Ottawa Valley Radio, including CKOB in Renfrew and CKOA in Arnprior, was sold by then-owner Jamie Pole in 1991 to Annapolis Valley Radio Ltd. In their decision, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) believed this transaction would provide the stations a new opportunity for growth and community involvement. Unfortunately they also permitted the reduction of locally produced programming from 126 to 21 hours per week. Eventually Pelmorex acquired CKOB and CKOA, both of which were converted to rebroadcasters of CHRO in Pembroke. CHVR moved to FM in 1996. Due to its signal strength, the Renfrew and Arnprior rebroadcasters were both discontinued. Local programming was also discontinued in both communities. No doubt feeling the backlash against these decisions, in 2004 the CRTC approved a new FM licensed station in Renfrew, Ontario to Jamie Pole's son, Jon Pole. Jon Pole, served as president of the new company along with business partner Andrew Dickson. Owned by My Broadcasting Corporation, with its first station in Renfrew, Ontario, their radio network now includes Pembroke, Arnprior, Napanee, Brighton, Gananoque, Strathroy, St. Thomas, Goderich, Kincardine, Saugeen Shores, Exeter, Simcoe, Cobourg, Peterborough, Alliston, Orangeville and Milton.

The Single-Six was first released in June 1953.\\"Ruger's Old Model Single-Sixes\\" by Bill Hamm The Single-Six is currently produced as the New Model Single-Six. The term \\"New Model\\" simply means that this model includes Ruger's transfer bar mechanism for increased safety, allowing one to carry the revolver safely with all six chambers loaded. Prior to 1973, the Single-Six was produced without the transfer bar mechanism, making it less safe to carry with all six chambers loaded, and with the hammer resting on a loaded chamber. The transfer bar safety allows the revolver to fire only when the trigger has been pulled.

Barrel lengths include 4‚Öù, 5¬Ω, 6¬Ω, 7¬Ω, and 9¬Ω inches, available in both blued and stainless steel. Ruger manufactures several \\"convertible\\" models that ship with both a .22 LR cylinder and .22 WMR cylinder, allowing the use of both cartridges. The .22 Short and .22 Long cartridges can also be fired in the Long Rifle cylinder. For those models that ship with both cylinders, the last 3 digits of the serial number are engraved on the front of the cylinder; only cylinders that have been properly timed should be used with any given revolver. The term Super Single-Six refers to those models which have fully adjustable target sights. In 2011 Ruger introduced the Single-Ten and in 2012 they introduced the Single-Nine. Both of these revolvers are stainless steel variants of the Single-Six design with fiber optic sights. The Single-Ten is chambered in .22 Long Rifle, with ten chambers and a 5.5 inch barrel, whereas the Single-Nine is chambered in .22 Winchester Magnum Rimfire (.22 WMR), with nine chambers and a barrel length of 6.5 inches.

It is managed by the Palm Beach County Parks and Recreation Department. The original site for the park was purchased in 1973, and at the time only about 10% (90 acres) of the area was in its natural state. After 23 years of reclamation, the park was completed in June 1996. Covering over , the park encompasses two lakes; with access for boating, fishing, water skiing, and radio controlled boating. Okeeheelee's construction was split into 6 phases, however some did not make it, such as phase 5 which was to be a water park. The park has amenities for many types of sports, including a 27 hole golf course, with pro shop and clubhouse, baseball fields, tennis courts, and a BMX biking area. There is both a fitness trail and bike trail that snakes between the lakes, with many pavilions and picnic areas along the way. At the north end of the park, situated on of original natural habitat, is the Okeeheelee Nature Center. Finished in 1996, it consists of more than of trails, which travel through the pine flatwoods habitat. The trail includes interpretive signs, trailside benches, and an elevated blind. There is also a Butterfly Garden, and marsh viewing blinds. Inside are live animal exhibits, interactive displays, and a gift shop. There are also educational programs for both adults and children. There is a dog park in Okeeheelee Park called Pooch Pines. There are three areas, two for large dogs, and one for small dogs. The hours are the same as the rest of the park, except it is closed from noon to 3 p.m on Wednesdays for maintenance.http://www.co.palm- beach.fl.us/parks/dogparks/poochpines/ ==History== Strip mining occurred in the area today occupied by Okeeheelee Park in the 1950s and 1960s. In March 1973, 20 organizations, lead by the Palm Beach County Medical Society, proposed using the land for a nature park. About a month later, the Palm Beach County Board of County Commissioners voted for using of land - located south of Forest Hill Boulevard, east of Florida's Turnpike, and west of Jog Road - for development of a park. In the same meeting, the commission also voted to appraise the value of of private property on the north side of Forest Hill Boulevard. After the private property value was assessed at just over $7 million, the county commission voted in July 1973 to request federal funds to cover approximately half of the price, but the request was denied in October of that year. The county commission later decided to request money from the state of Florida, which granted the request on March 19, 1974. On April 30, the county commission approved of naming the park Okeeheelee Park. \\"Okeeheelee\\" is Seminole for \\"pretty waters\\". A dedication ceremony for the park was held on June 15, 1974. Notable guests and participants in the ceremony included Doyle Conner, Florida Commissioner of Agriculture; John Dance, Palm Beach County Parks and Recreation Director; Fred Otis Dickinson, Florida Comptroller; Richard Stone, former Secretary of State of Florida who was elected to the United States Senate that year; Ralph Turlington, Florida Commissioner of Education; and county commissioners Robert Johnson, Lake Lytal, and George Warren. However, development of Okeeheelee Park was slow, with the first phase of the park not completed until March 1982\\\\.

Therefore, he often visited Dewanoumi stable and was trained by yokozuna Tochigiyama Moriya. He later became head coach of Nishonoseki stable whilst still active in the ring, and under his leadership the stable enjoyed one of its most successful periods in its history.

He was the first yokozuna in sumo since the retirement of Miyagiyama a year and a half earlier. His promotion was seen as a reward for staying with the Sumo Association and helping them through the Shunjuen Incident. Tamanishiki often went to Tatsunami stable and trained wrestlers, such as later yokozuna Futabayama Sadaji. Tatsunami stable was small at that time, but the stable became stronger in the sumo world later on. Tamanishiki defeated Futabayama the first six times they met in competition, but he was never able to beat him again after Futabayama began his record winning run in 1936. Tamanishiki was the first yokozuna to raise one leg high while performing yokozuna dohy≈ç-iri (the yokozuna ring-entering ceremony).

Web. 14 May 2016 He attended the Academy of the Nude (painting from nude models) instituted by Giancarlo Doria.Assereto, Gioacchino at the Prado Museum He was active in Genoa. In 1639 Assereto he travelled to Rome where he visited the studios of various painters. He likely met Genoese artists working in Rome, such as Luca Saltarello, Giovanni Maria Bottalla, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione and Giovanni Andrea Podest√†. His stay in Rome was important as it brought him in contact with the developing realism of the followers of Caravaggio. The Torture of Prometheus In the 1640s Assereto was active as a fresco painter. The artist was very successful in Genoa and in his later years many copies of his work were produced in his studio, some by his son Giuseppe Assereto. The artist was in his lifetime praised by the contemporary Genoese biographer Raffaele Soprani as incomparable. The vain artist shared this view.Mary Newcome, An Unknown Early Painting and Some Other Works by Assereto, Jahrbuch der Berliner Museen, 27. Bd. (1985), p. 61-75 ==Work== Most of Assereto's works depict religious and history subjects, although he also produced some portraits. Throughout the decade in which he was a student, Assereto produced many works in a Baroque idiom, which were close in style and genre. He incorporated drama and emotion in his paintings with the aid of the chiaroscuro and sfumato techniques. He continued to improve his technique and style during his twenties and thirties. During his visit to Rome in 1639 he discovered a flourishing interest in realism and Caravaggism. His interest in realism and encouraged him to continue with his detailed description of heads and hands. It may also have revealed to him the possibilities of compositions that depend on chiaroscuro rather than on colour. The Lamentation In 1640 Assereto painted The Lamentation,The Lamentation is found at Cummer Museum of Art and Gardens. a powerful picture which uses a black background and intense shadows to give dramatic effect to Christ's dead body that almost seems to shimmer in the darkness.Gioacchino Assereto, The Lamentation at Cummer Museum A work also showing this Caravaggist influence is the Death of Cato (Musei di Strada Nuova, Palazzo Bianco, Genoa), in which Assereto moved away from his refined style with vivid colours to a bolder, more powerful style where theatrical effects of flaming torches and candlelight emphasize violent emotions. The work also shows the influence of northern Caravaggesque painters such as Gerrit van Honthorst and Matthias Stom. In the 1640s he devoted himself to an in-depth study of the works of Rubens and Anthony van Dyck. As a result, his compositions became more lively and agitated. He also introduced a greater emotional involvement in his works through the use of lights and colours that reveal the knowledge of the Venetian school.

These works have been compared to works by Vel√°zquez and Murillo. An example is Esau sells his birthright (c. 1645; Palazzo Bianco, Genoa). Esau sells his birthright Gioacchino Assereto was also active as a fresco painter. In the 1640s he painted frescoes for the Palazzo Granello and commissioned works for the Sant'Agostino church.

It is an immune checkpoint blocker. Previously in development by Pfizer, it is now in investigation by MedImmune, a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca.Mechanism of Pathway: CTLA-4 Inhibition It has been undergoing human trials for the treatment of various cancers but has not attained approval for any. ==Mechanism of action== Tremelimumab aims to stimulate an immune system attack on tumors. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can recognize and destroy cancer cells. However, there is also an inhibitory mechanism (immune checkpoint) that interrupts this destruction. Tremelimumab turns off this inhibitory mechanism and allows CTLs to continue to destroy the cancer cells. This is immune checkpoint blockade. Tremelimumab binds to the protein CTLA-4, which is expressed on the surface of activated T lymphocytes and inhibits the killing of cancer cells. Tremelimumab blocks the binding of the antigen-presenting cell ligands B7.1 and B7.2 to CTLA-4, resulting in inhibition of B7-CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation; subsequently, B7.1 or B7.2 may interact with another T-cell surface receptor protein, CD28, resulting in a B7-CD28-mediated T-cell activation unopposed by B7-CTLA-4-mediated inhibition. Unlike Ipilimumab (another fully human anti- CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody), which is an IgG1 isotype, tremelimumab is an IgG2 isotype. ==Clinical trialsMelanoma=== Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies in metastatic melanoma showed some responses. However, based on early interim analysis of phase III data, Pfizer designated tremelimumab as a failure and terminated the trial in April 2008. However, within a year, the survival curves showed separation of the treatment and control groups. The conventional Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) may underrepresent the merits of immunotherapies. Subsequent immunotherapy trials (e.g. ipilimumab) have used the Immune-Related Response Criteria (irRC) instead. ===Mesothelioma=== Although it was designated in April 2015 as orphan drug status in mesothelioma,FDA Grants AstraZeneca's Tremelimumab Orphan Drug Status for Mesothelioma tremelimumab failed to improve lifespan in the phase IIb DETERMINE trial, which assessed the drug as a second or third-line treatment for unresectable malignant mesothelioma.AZ' tremelimumab fails in mesothelioma trial === Non-small cell lung cancer === In a phase III trial, AstraZeneca paired tremelimumab with a PD-L1 inhibitor, durvalumab, for the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.

Rock salt was laid down in this region some 220 million years ago, during the Triassic period. Seawater moved inland from an open sea, creating a chain of shallow salt marshes across what is today the Cheshire basin. As the marshes evaporated, deep deposits of rock salt were formed. ==History of salt workings in CheshireNorthwich=== A settlement, Condate, was built during Roman times at the current location of Northwich. It is believed that the Romans built this settlement due to the strategic river crossing of the Weaver and the presence of the brine springs. The Romans used lead salt pans to extract the salt from the brine. Salt pans and first-century brine kilns have both been found around the Roman fort. The salt beds beneath Northwich were re-discovered in the 1670 by employees of the local Smith-Barry family. The family were actually looking for coal when they accidentally discovered rock salt in the grounds of their house, Marbury Hall, Marbury, north of Northwich with salt extraction starting shortly afterwards. Salt was also extracted in the area immediately north east of Northwich, including the villages of Marston (including the Lion Salt Works) and Wincham (including the New Cheshire Salt Works). In the 19th century it became uneconomical to mine salt, and so solvent extraction using water as a solvent was used. Hot water was pumped through the mines that dissolved the salt and the resultant brine was pumped out and the salt extracted from the brine. This technique was known as wild brine pumping or natural brine pumping but weakened mines and led to land subsidence as mines collapsed. The collapse of a number of mines led to salt mining to move to Winsford. There are two chief museums of the industry in the Northwich area, the most recent addition being the Lion Salt Works museum. The Salt Museum of Thomas Ward and John Brunner was founded in the 19th century and is now housed in the Weaver Hall Museum and Workhouse. ===Middlewich=== Following the Roman invasion, Middlewich was named Salinae on account of the salt deposits around it, as it was one of their major sites of salt production. During this time the Romans built a fort at Harbutts Field (SJ70216696), to the north of the town and recent excavations to the south of the fort have found evidence of further Roman activity including a well and part of a preserved Roman road. Salt manufacture has remained one of the principal employers in Middlewich for most of the past 2,000 years. Salt making is mentioned in the Domesday Book, and by the 13th century there were approximately 100 \\"wich houses\\" packed around the town's two brine pits. By 1908 there were nine industrial scale salt manufacturers in the town, with a number of open pan salt works close to the Trent and Mersey Canal. ===Nantwich=== The origins of the settlement at Nantwich date to Roman times when salt from Nantwich was used by the Roman garrisons at Chester and Stoke-on-Trent as both a preservative and a condiment. Salt has been used in the production of Cheshire cheese and in the tanning industry, both industries being products of the dairy industry based on the Cheshire Plain around Nantwich. In the Domesday Book, Nantwich is recorded as having eight salt houses. The salt industry peaked in the late 16th century when there were 216 salt houses, but the industry ended in 1856 with the closure of the last salt house. Similarly the last tannery closed in 1974, but the clothing industry remains important to the area. ===Winsford=== From the 1830s, salt became important to Winsford, partly because the salt mines under Northwich had begun to collapse and another source of salt near the River Weaver was needed. A new source was discovered in Winsford, leading to the development of a salt industry along the course of the River Weaver, where many factories were established. By 1897, Winsford had become the largest producer of salt in Britain. As a result, a new town developed within a mile of the old Borough of Over which had been focused on Delamere Street. Most of the early development took place on the other side of the river, with new housing, shops, pubs, chapels and a new church being built in the former hamlet of Wharton. As the wind usually blew the smoke away from Over, it became the place for the wealthier inhabitants to live. However, people who worked on the barges and other people working in Winsford started to develop along the old Over Lane (now High Street). The old borough tried to remain separate but had been connected by the 1860s. ==Current salt manufacturing in Cheshire== The manufacture of white salt for food and allied industries is now concentrated in Middlewich, in the manufacturer, British Salt, who sell under the name Saxa, and also through third parties e.g. supermarket own brands. Salt produced by British Salt in Middlewich has 57% of the UK market for salt used in cooking. The UK's largest rock salt (halite) mine is at Winsford. It is one of only three places where rock salt is commercially mined in the UK, the others being at Boulby Mine, North Yorkshire and Kilroot near Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland.Irish Salt Mining and Exploration Company Rock salt extraction began at Winsford in the 17th century. Initially it was used only as salt licks for animals, and to strengthen weak brine. In 1844 Winsford Rock Salt Mine was opened, and is claimed by its operator, Salt Union Ltd., to be \\"Britain's oldest working mine\\". ==See also== * History of salt * History of salt in Middlewich * Lion Salt Works * Weaver Hall Museum and Workhouse, Northwich * Open pan salt making * Cheshire Brine Subsidence Compensation Board ==References== ==Further reading== * Calvert, A F (1915), Salt in Cheshire, London: E and F N Spon * Hewitson, C (2015), The Open Pan: The Archaeology and History of the Lion Salt Works, Lion Salt Works Trust Research Report 6 * Lightfoot, Tom (2000), Open Pan Salt Making in Cheshire: An Illustrated Description, Lion Salt Works Trust Research Report 1 ==External links== * Weaver Hall Museum and Workhouse, Northwich * Romans Salt Manufacturers' Association * Anglo Saxons Salt Manufacturers' Association * Normans Salt Manufacturers' Association * Winsford Rock Salt Mine Category:Cheshire Category:Manufacturing in England Category:Salt production ","title":"Salt in Cheshire"},{"id":"9133836","text":"Wansbeck by-election may refer to one of three parliamentary by-elections held in the British House of Commons constituency of Wansbeck in Northumberland: *1918 Wansbeck by-election *1929 Wansbeck by-election *1940 Wansbeck by- election ;See also *Wansbeck (UK Parliament constituency) ","title":"Wansbeck by-election"},{"id":"9133841","text":"The smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) is an otter species occurring in most of the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, with a disjunct population in Iraq. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 and is threatened by habitat loss, pollution of wetlands and poaching for the illegal wildlife trade. As its name indicates, its fur is smooth and shorter than that of other otter species. ==Characteristics== The smooth-coated otter is a relatively large otter, from in weight and in head- body length, with a tail long. It is distinguished from other otter species by its more rounded head and a hairless nose in the shape of a distorted diamond. Its tail is flattened, in contrast to the more rounded tails of other otters. Its legs are short and strong, with large webbed feet bearing strong claws. As its name suggests, it has unusually short and sleek fur; this is dark to reddish brown along the back, while the underside is light brown to almost grey in color. Females have two pairs of teats. == Taxonomy == Lutra perspicillata was the scientific name proposed by √âtienne Geoffroy Saint- Hilaire in 1826 for a brown otter collected in Sumatra. Lutrogale was proposed as generic name by John Edward Gray in 1865 for otters with a convex forehead and nose, using perspicillata as type species. In the 19th and 20th centuries, several zoological specimens were described, including: *Lutrogale perspicillata sindica proposed by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1940 were seven pale skins of smooth-coated otters collected in the Sukkur and Khairpur Districts in Pakistan's Sindh Province. *Lutrogale perspicillata maxwelli proposed by Robert William Hayman in 1957 was a dark brown adult male smooth- coated otter collected on the bank of the Tigris River in Iraq. The smooth- coated otter is the only living species in the genus Lutrogale. Three subspecies are recognised: * L. p. perspicillata occurs in most of India, Nepal, southwestern Yunnan, most of Southeast Asia, Sumatra and Java * L. p. sindica occurs in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Sindh Provinces. * L. p. maxwelli occurs in Iraq. The smooth-coated otter groups with the Asian small-clawed otter and the African clawless otter into a sister clade to the genus Lutra. The smooth-coated otter and the Asian small-clawed otter genetically diverged about 1.33 ¬± 0.78 million years ago. Hybridisation of smooth-coated otter males with Asian small-clawed otter females occurred in Singapore. The resulting offspring and their descendants bred back into the smooth-coated otter population, but maintained the genes of their small-clawed otter ancestors. Today, a population of at least 60 hybrid otters exists in Singapore. ==Distribution and habitat== Smooth-coated otter, Tungabhadra River Bank, Humpi, Karnataka, India The smooth-coated otter has been recorded in Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, southwest China, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesian islands of Borneo, Sumatra and Java, and Brunei. An isolated population is also found in the marshes of Iraq. It occurs in areas where fresh water is plentiful ‚Äî wetlands and seasonal swamps, rivers, lakes, and rice paddies. Where it is the only occurring otter species, it lives in almost any suitable habitat. But where it is sympatric with other otter species, it avoids smaller streams and canals in favour of larger water bodies. Although it is often found in saltwater near the coast, especially on smaller islands, it requires a nearby source of fresh water. The population in the Mesopotamian Marshes was feared to have perished, but otter tracks were found in 2009, suggesting the population may have survived. Skins of smooth-coated otters were found during surveys between 2005 and 2012 in the vicinity of Hammar and Hawizeh Marshes. Tracks and scat found in Erbil Province were also thought to have been left by smooth-coated otters. In southern Bangladesh, smooth-coated otters are used for commercial fishing. They are bred in captivity, trained, and used to chase fish into fishing nets. By 2011, this fishing technique was used by about 300 fishermen, with an additional 2,000 people indirectly dependent on the technique for their livelihood. ==Behaviour and ecology== The smooth-coated otter lives in groups of up to 11 individuals. They rest on sandy riverbanks and establish their dens under tree roots or among boulders. Observations in Peninsular Malaysia indicate that they are active foremost during the day, with a short rest during midday. They mark their playground by urinating and sprainting on rocks or vegetation. They communicate through vocalisations such as whistles, chirps, and wails. === Diet === Smooth-coated otters were observed to forage on river banks among tree trunks. They feed mainly on fish including Trichogaster, climbing gourami and catfish. During the rice planting season, they also hunt rats in rice fields. Snakes, amphibians and insects constitute a small portion of their diet. Especially in areas where they share habitat with other otter species, they prefer larger fish, typically between in length. In Kuala Selangor Nature Park, an otter group was observed hunting. They formed an undulating, slightly V-shaped line, pointing in the direction of movement and nearly as wide as the creek. The largest individuals occupied the middle section. In this formation, they undulated wildly through the creek, causing panic‚Äëstricken fish to jump out of the water a few metres ahead. They suddenly dived and grasped the fish with their snouts. Then they moved ashore, tossed the fish up a little on the muddy part of the bank, and swallowed it head‚Äëfirst in one piece. ===Reproduction=== Smooth-coated otter young at Wingham Wildlife Park Smooth-coated otters form small family groups of a mated pair with up to four offspring from previous seasons. Copulation occurs in water and lasts less than one minute. So long as the food supply is sufficient, they breed throughout the year, but where otters are dependent on monsoons for precipitation, breeding occurs between October and February. A litter of up to five pups is born after a gestation period of 60 to 63 days. The mothers give birth to and raise their young in a burrow near water. They may either construct such a burrow themselves, or they may take over an abandoned one. At birth, the pups are blind and helpless, but after 10 days, their eyes open, and they are weaned at about three to five months. They reach adult size at about a year of age, and sexual maturity at two or three years. == Threats == The smooth-coated otter is threatened by poaching, loss and destruction of wetlands, as these are converted for settlements, agriculture and hydroelectric projects; water courses are being polluted by pesticides such as chlorinated hydrocarbons and organophosphates. These factors lead to a reduced prey base. Otters are indiscriminately killed especially at aquaculture sites. Trapping of otters is prevalent in India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. Along the Chambal River in India, smooth-coated otters are most vulnerable during winter when they rear young. During this season, they are disturbed by humans harvesting crops and removing wood along rocky stretches of the river. Six juvenile smooth-coated otters were discovered in a bag left at Bangkok airport in January 2013. This was the first case of smooth-coated otters thought to have been destined for the illegal pet trade. At least seven smooth-coated otters were offered for sale through websites by traders in Thailand and Malaysia between 2016 and 2017. ==Conservation == The smooth- coated otter is a protected species in most range countries and listed globally as a vulnerable species. It had been listed on CITES Appendix II since 1977. Since August 2019, it is included in CITES Appendix I, thus strengthening its protection in regards to international trade. ==References* Category:Otters Otter, smooth-coated Otter, smooth- coated Otter, smooth-coated Otter, smooth-coated Category:Carnivorans of Malaysia Category:Mammals of Borneo Category:Mammals of Myanmar Category:Mammals of Thailand Category:Mammals of Bangladesh Category:Fauna of Sumatra Otter, smooth-coated Category:Mammals described in 1826 Category:Semiaquatic mammals ","title":"Smooth-coated otter"},{"id":"9133845","text":"Annunciation Sebastiano Mazzoni (c. 1611 - Venice, 22 April 1678) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period.

Here can be seen some of the oldest rock cut cave temples, as well as the longest rock-cut edicts, similar to Asokan edicts and extremely rare in the south of India. The town houses Vijayalaya Choleeswaram built during the 9th century. The two rock-cut temples are classic examples of how temple architecture styles were fusing in different parts of the country. ==History== Image of pilasters on the lower part of the vimana Narthamalai was ruled from the 7th to 9th centuries by the Mutharaiyars, who were feudatories of the Pallavas. The region was later captured by Medieval Cholas. Though the temple is called Vijayalaya Choleeswaram, the temple was originally built by Muttaraiyar lieutant, Sattan Paliyili, during the seventh regnal year of Pallava king Nripatungavarman during 862 CE. As per some accounts, the temple is believed to have been built by the first king of Medieval Cholas, Vijayalaya Chola (848- 891 CE), but the view is highly debated. As per the inscriptions, immediately after the construction, the temple was damaged by rains and lightning. The restoration work was carried out by Tennavan Tamiladirayan. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by archaeological department of India as a protected monument. The place was called Telinga-kula-kala-puram in the 11th century during the times of Rajaraja Chola I and his son Rajendra Chola I. ==Tourism== Narthamalai is located 11 miles Northeast West of Pudukottai in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. The cave temples of Narthamalai have stood the test of time. Its beautifully carved pillars and statues will never give away that these temples date all the way back to the early medieval era. Narthamalai has six large, skillfully carved of Lord Vishnu in the central hall. A life size portrait of Lord Vishnu will leave the visitors speechless with the levels of skill, effort and the time taken to create it. The Vijayalaya Choleswara temple at Narthamalai is the most beautiful structure in Narthamalai hills. Vijayalaya Choleeswaram is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. Constructed in the Nagara style of architecture and rock cut architecture, the temple is believed to have been built during the 9th century by Muttaraiyar kings, the cardinals of Pallavas, with later expansion from the Cholas. The rock-cut architecture is an early example of Chola Art, continuing the tradition of the Pallavas. The other portions of Narthamalai houses the 8th century Jaina Abode, the Aluruttimalai Jain Caves. There are also two rock-cut caves, one of which houses twelve life size sculptures of Vishnu. The temple is considered one of the oldest stone temples in South India. A manifestation of ancient Tamil culture, the Narthamalai temples is just one of your tutors if you want learn more about one of the oldest living civilization.

The conquest was short-lived; Sweden was able to regain control of the province in November the same year. ==Strategic aims== J√§mtland had been ceded to Sweden by Denmark-Norway at the Treaty of Br√∂msebro in 1645, and was, therefore, a target for reconquest. From the onset of the war, the Swedish strategic plan had included an attack into Norway from J√§mtland. However, the crises on the other fronts had repeatedly drawn away from the troops that would have participated in such an attack.Swedish attacks on Jamtland during 1563-1677 (Bo Oscarsson. 2001) ==Development== In the beginning of 1677 news arrived that the Norwegians defending Trondheim had moved south to reinforce the army of Ulrik Frederick Gyldenl√∏ve. This presented an opportunity for advancing across the Norwegian border. The attacking force was to be led by Carl Larsson Sparre, the governor-general of V√§sternorrland county. He had at his disposal a force of 1,700 men, of which three companies were local men from J√§mtland. However, he was unable to feed these troops, and furthermore, the troops, who hadn't received payment in ten months, had dispersed across Norrland to live meagerly off the land, which had been ravaged by famine for several years. Thus, the planned attack had to be abandoned. That summer Swedish reconnaissance indicated that the Norwegians were themselves gathering forces in Trondheim and R√∏ros and preparing for an attack across the border. Sparre received a dispatch from Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie encouraging him to prevent this attack by moving his men either towards Trondheim or alternatively to R√∏ros and on through the valley of Gudbrandsdal to V√§rmland. Sparre chose the latter alternative, detaching major Carl Rutencrantz with a force to Oviken, but delaying his own departure to await a promised complement of 1,400 men from √ñsterbotten. Sparre also attempted to muster troops and supplies from J√§mtland itself, but like in Sk√•ne and Bohusl√§n the people were still loyal to their former masters. The Swedes were barely tolerated, and promised supplies and horses never appeared. When the troops from √ñsterbotten finally arrived, they numbered only 290, and were poorly armed and trained. Short of ammunition and unable to feed his troops, Sparre was again forced to scatter his troops to live off the land. News now arrived of the Norwegians crossing the border. Sparre was now in an even more precarious position: his defensive positions were in disrepair and he had no means to strengthen them. There were only fourteen cannon at his disposal. On August 16, a large Norwegian force attacked Rutencrantz' positions at Oviken. The engagement had barely begun when the J√§mtlandians abandoned their positions and defected to the Norwegians. The remaining Swedish dragoons held their positions and continued fighting into the night until they were overrun. Before news of this action had reached Sparre, he had decided to move his remaining troops north to Brunflo in order block the Norwegians' access to Storsj√∂n. While the infantry marched overland, the artillery was to be transported by boat. At his arrival, Sparre found only 400 men and the artillery lost, and retired to Gullesundsbro. There he learned that Rutencrantz' detachment in Oviken had been defeated. This prompted him to rush to Borgsj√∂ to regroup. His army had been reinforced to 1,700 men but he dared not attempt to stop the Norwegian force, as he had convinced himself he was surrounded by larger enemy numbers. The Norwegians had captured about 400 men and four cannon. A medal was struck to commemorate the victories and celebrate the reconquest of the former Norwegian province. On the Swedish side, blame of the failure was directed at Sparre, who in turn blamed his scant supplies and paucity of men. Charles XI was a stern master and relieved him, naming Jacob Fleming governor-general of J√§mtland in his stead. Field marshal Henrik Horn was ordered to lead the troops in the general area of Stockholm to defend Norrland. Horn assembled his men in Medelpad in the fall of 1677 and had hardly begun his march into the J√§mtland when news reached him that the Norwegians had already left. Reconnoitering Swedish cavalry had given them the impression that a larger force was arriving, so they left J√§mtland November 1 after burning their stores. This was a stroke of luck for the Swedes, as Norrland was still suffering from the famine, and it would have been near impossible to find supplies for his men. As he was entering J√§mtland, Horn received a letter from the king, where he was ordered to investigate the reports of treachery from the local people. In December the clergy and local representatives were summoned for questioning. Horn learned that a secret alliance had been made between the people of J√§mtland and the Norwegians, ratified with the local communities' seals. Severe reprisals were feared, but in the end the people of J√§mtland were ordered to hand over their weapon in order to prevent \\"future secret aid to the enemy\\". This relatively mild punishment was in stark contrast to the harsh treatment of the Scanian lands. ==References== ==Sources== *Bj√∂rlin, Gustaf (1885) Kriget mot Danmark 1675 - 1679 *Vaupell, Otto Frederik (1872) Den danske h√¶rs historie til nutiden og den norske h√¶rs historie, indtil 1814 (University of Michigan Library. 1872) * Sehlin, Carl (1929 Grunddragen av J√§mtlands och H√§rjedalens historia (√ñstersund, J√§mtlands L√§ns Bildningsf√∂rbunds f√∂rlag) *Gjerset, Knut (1915) History of the Norwegian People (The MacMillan Company) *Lisk, Jill (1967) The Struggle for Supremacy in the Baltic: 1600-1725 (Funk & Wagnalls, New York) Category:1677 in Europe Category:Conflicts in 1677 Category:History of J√§mtland Category:Battles involving Sweden Category:Battles involving Norway Category:Battles involving Denmark Category:Scanian War ","title":"Conquest of Jemtland"},{"id":"9133983","text":"Muguet may refer to: ==People and fictional characters== * Francis Muguet (1955‚Äì2009), a French chemist * Georges Muguet, a sculptor who served as president of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais * Jeanne Josephine Muguet, wife of Claude Victor-Perrin, Duc de Belluno * Muguet, a character in the movie How Much Do You Love Me? ==Other== * Muguet, the French name for Lily of the valley ** Muguet de Bois, a perfume by Henri Robert * Prix du Muguet, a French horse race ","title":"Muguet"},{"id":"9134000","text":"The Swedish Inheritance Fund () is a Swedish State fund, established in 1928 when the Riksdag decided to abolish the right of inheritance for cousins and more distant relatives.

Wilde and Knight were husband and wife during filming. They divorced in 1951. ==Plot== Griff Marat (Cornel Wilde), is a parole officer who falls in love with a parolee, Jenny Marsh (Patricia Knight). Marsh had gone to prison in order to protect Harry Wesson (John Baragrey) a gambler with whom she was having an affair. Warned to steer clear of Harry permanently, Jenny disobeys, still feeling loyal to him. A raid on Harry's bookie joint while Jenny is there costs her the job Griff has found for her. Out of concern for her welfare, Griff hires Jenny as a caretaker for his blind mother (Esther Minciotti). Griff has political ambitions that Harry would like to ruin, so, knowing it is against regulations for the parolee and parole officer to be involved, Harry encourages Jenny to accept Griff's romantic advances. Jenny knows the regulations too, but realizes she loves Griff and they get married; she makes one more trip to speak to Harry, to tell him that she truly loves Griff. During their conversation, Harry threatens to reveal letters she had written him, in which she expressed her love. Jenny points Harry's own gun at him and, after a brief struggle, he ends up shot and seriously wounded. Griff and Jenny attempt to flee to Mexico. This fails but, willing to do anything to keep his wife from going back to jail, Griff takes a job in an oil refinery. Their photographs regularly appear in newspapers, but the last straw for Jenny is when a paper which includes their pictures is delivered to every neighbor in their refinery community. The couple decide to go back and turn themselves in. When the police take them to Harry in the hospital, he clears Jenny's name by swearing that the shooting was an accident. ==Cast== * Cornel Wilde as Griff Marat * Patricia Knight as Jenny Marsh * John Baragrey as Harry Wesson * Esther Minciotti as Mrs. Marat * Howard St. John as Sam Brooks * Russell Collins as Frederick Bauer * Charles Bates as Tommy Marat * Gilbert Barnett as Barry (uncredited) ==Background== The director of Shockproof, Douglas Sirk, said he took the assignment because the film dealt with one of his favorite themes: the price of flouting taboos.https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/movies/24shoc.html?_r=0 In Samuel Fuller's original script, the film ended with a violent rebellion by Marat against the system that kept him and Marsh apart.

The lurid setup and obsessive- loner-versus-the-system mechanics are pure Samuel Fuller.

In principle the FM and the FH and to a degree the NH cabs have a same layout with driver and passenger area, dashboard and seats as the common feature. The lower position of FM cabs is the primary difference between the FM and FH ranges FM12 first generation ==First-generation (1998‚Äì2001)Cabs=== What appeared to be scaled down FH cabs were initially available in three basic sizes, short day cab,sleeper cab, and globetrotter cab. Various trims and color option were available. Electric cab tilt was an option. ===Electric and electronics=== The electrical and electronic system shared with the FH series was based on electronic control units and data bus technology. The communication among the different control units run via two data links SAE J1939 and SAE J1708 allowed possibility of diagnostics, analysis and follow up of the vehicle's system via instrument cluster display. ===Engines=== Engines horsepower rating span from to in the initial release. *D7A -> 203 *D7C -> 250-290 hp *D10B -> 320-360 hp *D12C -> 380-420 hp D7C is a further development of D7 generation of engines however major difference between the latter is the increase of engine capacity from 6.7 litres to 7.3 litres thanks to increase in stroke and cylinder diameter.

Volvo FM with Globetrotter cab ==Second generation (2001‚Äì2005)== In 2001 FM series underwent major revision in conjunction with FH series.VOLVO TRUCKS INVESTS SEK 5.5 BILLION IN NEW HEAVY TRUCK RANGE Among changes resulted were 7- and 10-litre engines being dropped and replaced by an all-new 9-litre D9A engine and introduction of a new automated gear-change transmission I-Shift and new passive safety feature FUPS Front Underrun Protection System, designed to prevent smaller vehicles from being \\"under run\\" or wedged under front of the truck in an event of frontal collision. ===Engine and transmission=== The new D9A engine developed on the basis of D12 with single overhead camshaft and four valves per cylinder and electronic unit injectors followed with a new design feature for Volvo, timing gears at the flywheel side (rear) of the engine, design which will later become standard across entire Volvo truck engine range. D9A power output varies from 300 - and torque 1400 - 1700 Nm respectively. Introduction of I-Shift also spelled end for Geartronic (AGS) and its shortcomings however the I-Shift was designed to be what it is from ground up where Geartronic was an add on modification to existing manual transmission. In 2003 FM12 with D12D was launched as well as new version of Powertronic automatic transmission.VOLVO FM12 WITH 460 HORSEPOWER ‚Äì THE VERSATILE SPECIALIST - NOW STRONGER THAN EVER L ==2005 upgrade to present== Volvo FM with 6X4 FM 8x4 D13A engine D13B engine The evolution of Volvo FM series continued in 2005 FM - 2005 - 2000s : Volvo Trucks - Volvo Trucks Global with the release of a new generation of FM trucks powered by an all-new 13-litre D13A engine and improved 9-litre D9B unit and the second-generation I-Shift transmission.Volvo Trucks launches the cleanest and most fuel efficient trucks ever The naming of the series had also changed: engine size in litres is no longer used in the FM name.

It was created by co-founders Kevin Renton and Graeme Maclean, who first started out DJing under the now well known UKULA moniker at the city's Andy Poolhall in 2002. Copies of UKULA were to be found throughout the cities of Toronto, Montreal and New York City. Plans were underway to extend full distribution to include London and Edinburgh, though limited distribution was available in these two cities. In addition to publishing its glossy magazine, UKULA also had event planning and arts/culture consultancy departments catering to local bands and haute couture fashion houses interested in promoting their brand. Leah Rumack, writing for The Globe and Mail, described the store as the \\"ground zero for all things impossibly cool in music, books and fashion\\". ==History== After a year in Toronto, Renton and Maclean relocated to Montreal in 2003, where they continued their series of popular DJ nights. A year later, the first issue of UKULA Magazine hit the streets, a slim staple-bound 32 page paperbacked-sized volume that included interviews with then up-and-coming bands Arcade Fire and Kasabian. By the third issue, the magazine had evolved into a vibrant, glossy (with an average length of just over 100 pages), professionally bound magazine, with content about film, literature, travel and fashion. Renton and Maclean returned to Toronto in August 2006, and opened the UKULA boutique on 492 College St. A multi-purpose venue that could be converted for stage concerts and parties, the storefront featured a street-level lounge-style cafe, and sold books, magazines, CDs, and clothing. The magazine offices were located in the building's basement. Events at the UKULA store included the Canadian book launch of Stephen Hall's The Raw Shark Texts, as well as concert performances by Born Ruffians and The Coast. On November 5, 2005, the UKULA Bright Lights Festival in Toronto's Distillery District featured bands such as Elbow, The Duke Spirit, Stirling, The Call Up and the Meligrove Band. The 2007 Virgin Festival Afterparty hosted at UKULA featured a performance by The Cinematics, and attracted members of Metric, Smashing Pumpkins and The Killers. The magazine and its storefront and website all folded in 2008. ==References== ==External links== * Ukula website (archived) * Now Magazine: Store of the Week: Feb. 2007 * Profile on the Montreal Mirror (archived) * Profile on the McGill Daily Category:2004 establishments in Ontario Category:2008 disestablishments in Ontario Category:Alternative magazines Category:Visual arts magazines published in Canada Category:Cultural magazines published in Canada Category:Defunct magazines published in Canada Category:Magazines published in London Category:Magazines established in 2004 Category:Magazines disestablished in 2008 Category:Magazines published in Toronto Category:Magazines published in Montreal Category:Magazines published in New York (state) Category:Mass media in Edinburgh Category:Independent magazines ","title":"Ukula"},{"id":"9134053","text":"Erlizumab, also known as rhuMAb, is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that was an experimental immunosuppressive drug.

It applies physics, chemistry and mathematics to the understanding of how mantle convection leads to plate tectonics and geologic phenomena such as seafloor spreading, mountain building, volcanoes, earthquakes, faulting and so on. It also attempts to probe the internal activity by measuring magnetic fields, gravity, and seismic waves, as well as the mineralogy of rocks and their isotopic composition. Methods of geodynamics are also applied to exploration of other planets. == Overview == Geodynamics is generally concerned with processes that move materials throughout the Earth. In the Earth's interior, movement happens when rocks melt or deform and flow in response to a stress field.Turcotte, D. L. and G. Schubert (2014). \\"Geodynamics.\\" This deformation may be brittle, elastic, or plastic, depending on the magnitude of the stress and the material's physical properties, especially the stress relaxation time scale. Rocks are structurally and compositionally heterogeneous and are subjected to variable stresses, so it is common to see different types of deformation in close spatial and temporal proximity.Winters, J. D. (2001). \\"An introduction to igenous and metamorphic petrology.\\" When working with geological timescales and lengths, it is convenient to use the continuous medium approximation and equilibrium stress fields to consider the average response to average stress.Newman, W. I. (2012). \\"Continuum Mechanics in the Earth Sciences.\\" Experts in geodynamics commonly use data from geodetic GPS, InSAR, and seismology, along with numerical models, to study the evolution of the Earth's lithosphere, mantle and core. Work performed by geodynamicists may include: * Modeling brittle and ductile deformation of geologic materials * Predicting patterns of continental accretion and breakup of continents and supercontinents * Observing surface deformation and relaxation due to ice sheets and post-glacial rebound, and making related conjectures about the viscosity of the mantle * Finding and understanding the driving mechanisms behind plate tectonics. ==Deformation of rocks== Rocks and other geological materials experience strain according to three distinct modes, elastic, plastic, and brittle depending on the properties of the material and the magnitude of the stress field. Stress is defined as the average force per unit area exerted on each part of the rock. Pressure is the part of stress that changes the volume of a solid; shear stress changes the shape. If there is no shear, the fluid is in hydrostatic equilibrium. Since, over long periods, rocks readily deform under pressure, the Earth is in hydrostatic equilibrium to a good approximation. The pressure on rock depends only on the weight of the rock above, and this depends on gravity and the density of the rock. In a body like the Moon, the density is almost constant, so a pressure profile is readily calculated. In the Earth, the compression of rocks with depth is significant, and an equation of state is needed to calculate changes in density of rock even when it is of uniform composition. ===Elastic=== Elastic deformation is always reversible, which means that if the stress field associated with elastic deformation is removed, the material will return to its previous state. Materials only behave elastically when the relative arrangement along the axis being considered of material components (e.g. atoms or crystals) remains unchanged. This means that the magnitude of the stress cannot exceed the yield strength of a material, and the time scale of the stress cannot approach the relaxation time of the material. If stress exceeds the yield strength of a material, bonds begin to break (and reform), which can lead to ductile or brittle deformation.Karato, Shun-ichiro (2008). \\"Deformation of Earth Materials: An Introduction to the Rheology of Solid Earth.\\" ===Ductile=== Ductile or plastic deformation happens when the temperature of a system is high enough so that a significant fraction of the material microstates (figure 1) are unbound, which means that a large fraction of the chemical bonds are in the process of being broken and reformed. During ductile deformation, this process of atomic rearrangement redistributes stress and strain towards equilibrium faster than they can accumulate. Examples include bending of the lithosphere under volcanic islands or sedimentary basins, and bending at oceanic trenches. Ductile deformation happens when transport processes such as diffusion and advection that rely on chemical bonds to be broken and reformed redistribute strain about as fast as it accumulates. ===Brittle=== When strain localizes faster than these relaxation processes can redistribute it, brittle deformation occurs. The mechanism for brittle deformation involves a positive feedback between the accumulation or propagation of defects especially those produced by strain in areas of high strain, and the localization of strain along these dislocations and fractures. In other words, any fracture, however small, tends to focus strain at its leading edge, which causes the fracture to extend. In general, the mode of deformation is controlled not only by the amount of stress, but also by the distribution of strain and strain associated features. Whichever mode of deformation ultimately occurs is the result of a competition between processes that tend to localize strain, such as fracture propagation, and relaxational processes, such as annealing, that tend to delocalize strain. ===Deformation structures=== Structural geologists study the results of deformation, using observations of rock, especially the mode and geometry of deformation to reconstruct the stress field that affected the rock over time. Structural geology is an important complement to geodynamics because it provides the most direct source of data about the movements of the Earth. Different modes of deformation result in distinct geological structures, e.g. brittle fracture in rocks or ductile folding. ==Thermodynamics== The physical characteristics of rocks that control the rate and mode of strain, such as yield strength or viscosity, depend on the thermodynamic state of the rock and composition. The most important thermodynamic variables in this case are temperature and pressure. Both of these increase with depth, so to a first approximation the mode of deformation can be understood in terms of depth. Within the upper lithosphere, brittle deformation is common because under low pressure rocks have relatively low brittle strength, while at the same time low temperature reduces the likelihood of ductile flow. After the brittle-ductile transition zone, ductile deformation becomes dominant. Elastic deformation happens when the time scale of stress is shorter than the relaxation time for the material. Seismic waves are a common example of this type of deformation. At temperatures high enough to melt rocks, the ductile shear strength approaches zero, which is why shear mode elastic deformation (S-Waves) will not propagate through melts.Faul, U. H., J. D. F. Gerald and I. Jackson (2004). \\"Shear wave attenuation and dispersion in melt-bearing olivine ==Dynamics of the Earth== The main motive force behind stress in the Earth is provided by thermal energy from radioisotope decay, friction, and residual heat.Hager, B. H. and R. W. Clayton (1989). \\"Constraints on the structure of mantle convection using seismic observations, flow models, and the geoid.\\" Fluid Mechanics of Astrophysics and Geophysics 4.Stein, C. (1995). \\"Heat flow of the Earth.\\" Cooling at the surface and heat production within the Earth create a metastable thermal gradient from the hot core to the relatively cool lithosphere.Dziewonski, A. M. and D. L. Anderson (1981). \\"Preliminary reference Earth model.\\" Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors 25(4): 297-356. This thermal energy is converted into mechanical energy by thermal expansion. Deeper hotter and often have higher thermal expansion and lower density relative to overlying rocks. Conversely, rock that is cooled at the surface can become less buoyant than the rock below it. Eventually this can lead to a Rayleigh-Taylor instability (Figure 2), or interpenetration of rock on different sides of the buoyancy contrast.Ribe, N. M. (1998). \\"Spouting and planform selection in the Rayleigh‚ÄìTaylor instability of miscible viscous fluids.\\" Journal of Fluid Mechanics 377: 27-45. Figure 2 shows a Rayleigh- Taylor instability in 2D using the Shan-Chen model. The red fluid is initially located in a layer on top of the blue fluid, and is less buoyant than the blue fluid. After some time, a Rayleigh-Taylor instability occurs, and the red fluid penetrates the blue one. Negative thermal buoyancy of the oceanic plates is the primary cause of subduction and plate tectonics,Conrad, C. P. and C. Lithgow-Bertelloni (2004). \\"The temporal evolution of plate driving forces: Importance of ‚Äúslab suction‚Äù versus ‚Äúslab pull‚Äù during the Cenozoic.\\" Journal of Geophysical Research 109(B10): 2156-2202. while positive thermal buoyancy may lead to mantle plumes, which could explain intraplate volcanism.Bourdon, B., N. M. Ribe, A. Stracke, A. E. Saal and S. P. Turner (2006). \\"Insights into the dynamics of mantle plumes from uranium-series geochemistry.\\" Nature 444(7): 713-716. The relative importance of heat production vs. heat loss for buoyant convection throughout the whole Earth remains uncertain and understanding the details of buoyant convection is a key focus of geodynamics. ==Methods== Geodynamics is a broad field which combines observations from many different types of geological study into a broad picture of the dynamics of Earth. Close to the surface of the Earth, data includes field observations, geodesy, radiometric dating, petrology, mineralogy, drilling boreholes and remote sensing techniques. However, beyond a few kilometers depth, most of these kinds of observations become impractical. Geologists studying the geodynamics of the mantle and core must rely entirely on remote sensing, especially seismology, and experimentally recreating the conditions found in the Earth in high pressure high temperature experiments.(see also Adams‚ÄìWilliamson equation). === Numerical modeling === Because of the complexity of geological systems, computer modeling is used to test theoretical predictions about geodynamics using data from these sources. There are two main ways of geodynamic numerical modeling. # Modelling to reproduce a specific observation: This approach aims to answer what causes a specific state of a particular system. # Modelling to produce basic fluid dynamics: This approach aims to answer how a specific system works in general. Basic fluid dynamics modelling can further be subdivided into instantaneous studies, which aim to reproduce the instantaneous flow in a system due to a given buoyancy distribution, and time-dependent studies, which either aim to reproduce a possible evolution of a given initial condition over time or a statistical (quasi) steady-state of a given system. ==See also== * ==References== ;Bibliography * * * ==External links== *Geological Survey of Canada - Geodynamics Program *Geodynamics Homepage - JPL/NASA *NASA Planetary geodynamics *Los Alamos National Laboratory-Geodynamics & National Security *Computational Infrastructure for Geodynamics Category:Geophysics Category:Geodesy Category:Plate tectonics ","title":"Geodynamics"},{"id":"9134121","text":"Fontolizumab (planned trade name HuZAF) is a humanized monoclonal antibodyStatement On A Nonproprietary Name Adopted By The Usan Council - Fontolizumab, American Medical Association. and an immunosuppressive drug for the treatment of auto-immune diseases like Crohn's disease.

It is a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. It targets CD20 marker on B lymphocytes and hence is an immunosuppressive drug. Ocrelizumab binds to an epitope that overlaps with the epitope to which rituximab binds. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2017, and the first FDA approved drug for the primary progressive form of MS; it was discovered and developed and is marketed by Hoffmann‚ÄìLa Roche's subsidiary Genentech under the trade name Ocrevus. With the approval, the FDA also required the company to conduct several Phase IV clinical trials to better understand whether the drug is safe and effective in young people, cancer risks, and effects on pregnant women and children they might bear. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. ==Medical uses== In the US, ocrelizumab is indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults or for the treatment of primary progressive MS, in adults. It is administered by intravenous infusion. In the EU, ocrelizumab is indicated for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features and for the treatment of adults with early primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) in terms of disease duration and level of disability, and with imaging features characteristic of inflammatory activity. ==Contraindications== Ocrelizumab should not be used in people with hepatitis B infection or a history of severe reaction to this drug. If someone has an infection or infectious disease, treatment should be delayed until the infection is resolved. It has not been tested in pregnant women, but based on animal studies does not appear to be safe for pregnant women to take; it is excreted in breast milk, and effects on infants are unknown. ==Adverse effects == As of October 2016 the three Phase III clinical trials of ocrelizumab used to obtain approval had not been published. Based on published data from clinical trials at that time, the most common adverse events were infusion reactions including itchy skin, rash, hives, flushing, throat and mouth irritation, fever, fatigue, nausea, rapid heart beating, headache, and dizziness. One person died from a systemic inflammatory response syndrome and in another trial, rates of cancer were three times higher (2.3% vs 0.8%) in people taking the drug than people taking placebo. Clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus were halted because rates of serious infections were too high; these results were not seen in published trials in people with MS, and the differences may be due to the differences in the bodies of people with the different diseases, as well as other drugs they were taking. There is an increased risk of infections of all kinds, including respiratory infections, in people taking immunosupressive drugs like ocrelizumab. In clinical trials submitted to the FDA, more people taking ocrelizumab got infections than people taking Interferon beta-1a did, including upper and lower respiratory infections, herpes, and hepatitis B reactivation. The risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, a disease caused by viral infection of the brain, is also increased. An increased risk of malignancy with ocrelizumab may exist. In controlled trials, malignancies, including breast cancer, occurred more frequently in ocrelizumab-treated patients. Breast cancer occurred in 6 of 781 females treated with ocrelizumab for MS in clinical trials. None of 668 females treated in Rebif (interferon beta-1a) or placebo arms of the clinical trials developed breast cancer. Patients should follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines. ==Pharmacology== Ocrelizumab is an immunosuppresive drug; it binds to CD20, which is selectively made by B cells, and when ocrelizumab binds to CD20 it kills B cells by causing antibody-dependent cell- mediated cytotoxicity and, to a lesser extent, complement-dependent cytotoxicity. ==Chemistry == Ocrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to an CD20 epitope that overlaps partially with the epitope to which rituximab binds. It has an immunoglobulin G1 with a variable region against human CD20, with a human-mouse monoclonal 2H7 Œ≥1-chain, bound via disulfide links with human-mouse monoclonal 2H7 Œ∫-chain in a dimer. ==History== A study of rituximab in MS with strong results, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2008, drove interest in B-cell depletion as a strategy to treat MS and has led to extensive off-label use of rituximab to treat primary and relapsing MS. Rituximab is a mouse protein, and is immunogenic in humans, and Genentech and its parent Roche decided to focus on the similar, but humanized mAb that they already had, ocrelizumab, for MS instead. Clinical trials in people with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus were halted in 2010 because people with these conditions developed too many opportunistic infections when taking ocrelizumab. It was also studied in hematological cancer. In MS, phase II results were announced in October 2010, and in October 2015, Genentech presented interim results of three Phase III clinical trials. In February, 2016 the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for primary progressive multiple sclerosis. On March 28, 2017, the FDA approved ocrelizumab for relapsing-remitting and primary-progressive multiple sclerosis. It is the first FDA-approved treatment for the primary progressive form. When the FDA approved the drug, it required Roche to conduct several Phase IV clinical trials, including: a two-part study in people between ten and 17 years old with relapsing multiple sclerosis to determine dosing, then safety and efficacy in these people, required to be completed by 2024; a prospective five-year study to better understand the risk of cancer, required to be completed by 2030; a prospective study creating a registry of women with MS exposed to ocrelizumab before and during pregnancy, women with MS not exposed to ocrelizumab, and women without MS, to understand the effect on women and children they might bear, due by 2029; an additional pregnancy outcomes study due by 2024; and an additional non-human primate study on fetal development and outcomes due by 2019. The efficacy of ocrelizumab for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS was shown in two clinical trials in 1,656 participants treated for 96 weeks. Both studies compared ocrelizumab to another MS drug, Rebif (interferon beta-1a). In both studies, the patients receiving ocrelizumab had reduced relapse rates and reduced worsening of disability compared to Rebif. The trials were conducted in the US, Canada, Europe, Latin America, Africa and Australia. In a study of PPMS in 732 participants treated for at least 120 weeks, those receiving ocrelizumab showed a longer time to the worsening of disability compared to placebo. The study was conducted in the US, Canada and Europe. The application for ocrelizumab was granted breakthrough therapy designation, fast track designation, and priority review. The FDA granted approval of Ocrevus to Genentech, Inc. Ocrelizumab was approved for use in the European Union in January 2018. == See also == * Other anti-CD20 drugs: ** Rituximab, a chimeric antibody that is directed against CD20. ** Ofatumumab (HuMax-CD20) a fully human antibody that is directed against CD20 * BIIB033 (Anti-LINGO-1): another monoclonal antibody designed for treating multiple sclerosis == References == ==External links== * Category:Breakthrough therapy Category:Monoclonal antibodies Category:Genentech brands Category:Hoffmann-La Roche brands ","title":"Ocrelizumab"},{"id":"9134164","text":"was a Japanese professional sumo wrestler from Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture. He was the sport's 33rd yokozuna. He had a rapid rise through the ranks, setting several youth records, and was very popular with the public. However he did not fulfill his great potential at sumo's highest rank, missing many matches because of injury and winning no tournaments. ==Career== Emperor's Cup after winning the May 1931 tournament Born in Kohoku ward, he came from a poor peasant family and entered local sumo tournaments to provide for them. He was scouted by the former Ry≈çgoku Y≈´jir≈ç, who persuaded him to join Dewanoumi stable. Musashiyama made his professional debut in January 1926. He was far superior to his early opponents, becoming an elite sekitori at the age of just 19. He reached the top makuuchi division in May 1929, and was runner-up in his second makuuchi tournament. He reached the san'yaku ranks at komusubi in May 1930. His rapid rise was considered miraculous in an era when it was not unusual for new recruits to take several years to even progress from the lowest division. He missed out on the y≈´sh≈ç or tournament championship in March 1931 only because he was of a lower rank than Tamanishiki, who finished with the same score. (There was no playoff system until 1947). However, he won what was to be his only top division championship the next tournament in May 1931. A lean and handsome wrestler, Musashiyama was popular with tournament crowds. His picture sold more copies than any other wrestler. Fighting alongside other popular rikishi such as Tamanishiki, Minanogawa, and his stable mate, sekiwake Tenry≈´, Musashiyama was expected to become a figurehead of the sumo world for years to come. Two major events, however, had a severe impact on his career. He injured his right elbow in the October 1931 tournament, which reduced his power and never healed properly. Then in January 1932 he was promoted from komusubi to ≈çzeki, but in the same month Tenry≈´ and many other top wrestlers went on strike against the Japan Sumo Association, demanding reform of the organization, in what was to become known as the Shunjuen Incident. Musashiyama was criticized for his lukewarm support of the strike, but he never felt close to Tenry≈´'s group. In addition, several people insisted that the reason for Tenry≈´'s walkout was his jealousy of Musashiyama's fast promotion to ≈çzeki while he remained at sekiwake. Musashiyama had been considering giving up sumo altogether and turning to boxing instead, but eventually decided to stay in the Sumo Association. He was promoted to yokozuna in 1935, after finishing as runner-up in the May tournament that year. He had had good scores in the previous two tournaments as well, and had never had a make-koshi or losing score in his career. Nevertheless, his promotion at that point came as a surprise, and it was suggested that it had been engineered by the Takasago ichimon or stable group, so that Musashiyama's Dewanoumi group would be obliged to support the promotion of Minanogawa in return. Unfortunately, Musashiyama proved to be one of the least successful yokozuna ever. He was often absent from tournaments because of his elbow injury and did not win any further championships. He was so popular that he was always in demand to perform on regional tours, and rarely had a chance to recuperate properly from his injury. In his eight tournaments at yokozuna rank, he missed five, withdrew from two, and only managed one kachi-koshi or winning score. In his only kachi-koshi tournament, he faced yokozuna Minanogawa in a battle of two 6‚Äì6 yokozuna, and he defeated Minanogawa, which resulted in his opponent having a make-koshi, a very rare result for a yokozuna. He retired at the age of 29 without achieving any lasting success as a yokozuna, in May 1939. He had long been overshadowed by Futabayama, then at the peak of his career. ==Retirement from sumo== He remained in the sumo world for a time as a coach, and was known as Dekiyama and then Shiranui Oyakata. However, he left the Sumo Association in 1945. He tried his hand at farming, running a restaurant and operating a pachinko parlour in Tokyo, before returning to his home town to work in the real estate business. He died in 1969. His son also became a sumo wrestler at Dewanoumi stable but did not rise higher than the makushita division. ==Career record== *In 1927 Tokyo and Osaka sumo merged and four tournaments a year in Tokyo and other locations began to be held. ==References== ==See also== *Glossary of sumo terms *List of past sumo wrestlers *List of sumo tournament top division champions *List of sumo tournament second division champions *List of yokozuna Category:1909 births Category:1969 deaths Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Yokozuna Category:Sportspeople from Yokohama Category:Sumo people from Kanagawa Prefecture ","title":"Musashiyama Takeshi"},{"id":"9134165","text":"We Re-Built This City was the sixth and final album by Canadian punk rock band Closet Monster, released in 2004.

He was the sport's 34th yokozuna. ==Career== He was born . He had lost his father in the Russo-Japanese War at the age of two, and worked as a labourer to support his mother. Already tall at the age of 15, very large for Japanese youths in his time, he was spotted by Takasago stable's Akutsugawa. He made his debut in January 1924 and reached the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division after only six tournaments in January 1927. He initially relied on pushing techniques, or oshi-sumo, but began to develop a more rounded technique after being given instruction by former sekiwake Kiyosegawa. He was promoted to the top makuuchi division in January 1928. In 1929 Akutsugawa, the wrestler who had discovered him, retired and encouraged him to join his newly established Sadogatake stable. However Takasago's stablemaster, the former ≈çzeki Asashio Tar≈ç II, did not want his promising rikishi to leave and even changed Minanogawa's shikona to his own of Asashio to obligate him to stay. Eventually a compromise was worked out and Minanogawa divided his time between the two stables. He made komusubi in January 1930, and had two consecutive runner-up scores in October 1930 and January 1931, the second from the third highest sekiwake rank. Along with the lean and handsome Musashiyama he was one of the most popular men in sumo in this time. However, in 1931 he suffered a series of knee injuries, and in 1932 was caught up in the so-called \\"Shunj≈´en Incident\\", when a number of top division wrestlers went on strike. Minanogawa was out of the Japan Sumo Association for four tournaments and he and his followers held a number of their own rival tournaments with knockout rounds. He returned to the Sumo Association in 1933 and immediately took his first tournament championship with an unbeaten record, defeating Musashiyama, Shimizugawa and yokozuna Tamanishiki, all of whom had stayed with the Association during the strike. He reverted to the Minanogawa ring name and won his second championship in January 1934. This earned him promotion to ≈çzeki. He was promoted to yokozuna after a 9‚Äì2 runner-up score in January 1936, just one tournament after Musashiyama, and it was suggested that the double promotion was as a result of a deal between the Takasago and Dewanoumi factions. Although his record at yokozuna rank was not as bad as Musashiyama, who managed only one kachi-koshi winning score as a grand champion, Minanogawa was unable to win any further championships, and was overshadowed by Tamanishiki and the dominant Futabayama. He was never able to beat Futabayama as a yokozuna and had only one win over Tamanishiki. In May 1938 he could win only six out of 13 bouts, and became one of the very few yokozuna to compete in a full tournament and turn in a make-koshi losing score. By 1941 he was 36 years old and suffering from injuries, and he wanted to retire, but was asked to stay on until Maedayama or Akinoumi were ready to replace him. He eventually retired in January 1942, a tournament in which Akinoumi produced a strong 13‚Äì2 record. ==Retirement from sumo== Minanogawa had been able to stay in sumo as an elder due to his yokozuna ranking, but he had lost interest in sumo. He had recently married and started a family, and had also done a law and economics degree at Waseda University. He decided to resign from the Sumo Association (an irreversible decision) and run for election to parliament. However he lost badly and used up most of his severance pay from the Sumo Association. He also lost money through gambling. He tried a succession of unsuccessful jobs and even had a bit part in a 1958 Hollywood film called The Barbarian and the Geisha. He was eventually divorced from his wife and separated from his children, and in his later years was confined to a rest home and reliant on hand outs from fans and sumo officials. He died in 1971, largely forgotten by the general public. ==Career record== *In 1927 Tokyo and Osaka sumo merged and four tournaments a year in Tokyo and other locations began to be held. *Minanogawa, along with many others, was expelled from the Sumo Association for striking.

Reslizumab binds specifically to IL-5, a key cytokine responsible for the differentiation, maturation, recruitment and activation of human eosinophils. By binding to human IL-5, it blocks its biological function; consequently survival and activity of eosinophils are reduced. The benefits with reslizumab are its ability to reduce the exacerbation rate and improve lung function and asthma-related quality of life in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma (with blood eosinophil count ‚â• 400 cells/ŒºL) and with at least one previous asthma exacerbation in the preceding year. The most common side effects are increased blood creatine phosphokinase, myalgia and anaphylactic reactions. The FDA approved reslizumab (US trade name Cinqair) for use with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of severe asthma in patients aged 18 years and older on 23 March 2016. Cinqair is approved for patients who have a history of severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) despite receiving their current asthma medicines. The European Medicines Agency recommended the granting of a marketing authorisation for reslizumab (EU trade name Cinqaero) intended as add-on treatment in adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma on 23 June 2016. Reslizumab is supplied as a refrigerated, sterile, single-use, preservative-free solution for intravenous infusion. The reslizumab solution is a slightly hazy/opalescent, slightly yellow liquid and is supplied as 100 mg in a 10 mL glass vial. Each single-use vial of reslizumab is formulated as 10 mg/mL reslizumab in an aqueous solution containing 2.45 mg/mL sodium acetate trihydrate, 0.12 mg/mL glacial acetic acid, and 70 mg/mL sucrose, with a pH of 5.5. ==Medical usesEosinophilic asthma=== Reslizumab was first used for eosinophilic asthma in 2008. In a 106-patient, phase II clinical trial, the researchers showed reslizumab was effective in reducing sputum eosinophils. Furthermore, the patients receiving reslizumab showed improvements in airway function, and a general trend toward greater asthma control than those receiving placebo was observed. A large, 981-patient, phase III clinical trial showed that reslizumab was effective at improving lung function, asthma control, and quality of life in comparison to placebo. These results led to the FDA approval for the maintenance treatment of severe asthma in patients aged 18 years and older, with an eosinophilic phenotype on March 23, 2016. ==Adverse effects== Common adverse effects include: * oropharyngeal pain Less common adverse effects include: * musculoskeletal pain * neck pain * muscle spasms * extremity pain * muscle fatigue * anaphylaxis * malignancy The most common adverse effect of reslizumab was oropharyngeal (mouth and throat) pain. According to the phase III clinical trials data, oropharyngeal pain occurred in ‚â•2% of individuals along with elevated baseline creatine phosphokinase (CPK), which was more common in patients treated with reslizumab versus placebo. Myalgia was also reported more in patients in the reslizumab 3 mg/kg group versus the placebo group as well as some musculoskeletal adverse reactions. Lastly, some serious adverse reactions that occurred in subjects treated with reslizumab but not in those treated with placebo included anaphylaxis and malignancy. ==PharmacologyMechanism of action=== Reslizumab is an interleukin-5 antagonist monoclonal antibody. IL-5 is the major cytokine responsible for the growth and differentiation, recruitment, activation, and survival of eosinophils. Eosinophils play a role in the mediation of inflammation in the airways. Eosinophilic asthma is a phenotype of asthma that is characterized by the higher than normal presence of eosinophils in the lung and sputum. It has been shown that the numbers of eosinophils in the blood and bronchial fluid can correlate with asthma severity.Bousquet J, Chanez P, Lacoste JY, Barneon G, Ghavanian N, Enander I, Venge P, Ahlstedt S, Simony-Lafontaine J, Godard P, et al.. Eosinophilic inflammation in asthma. N Engl J Med 1990;323:1033‚Äì1039.DOI: 10.1056/NEJM199010113231505 Reslizumab binds to IL-5 with a dissociation constant of 81 pM and inhibiting IL-5 signaling, which reduces the production and survival of eosinophils. However, the mechanism of reslizumab action in asthma has not been definitively established. ===Pharmacodynamics=== Reductions in blood eosinophil counts were observed following the first dose of reslizumab and maintained through 52 weeks of treatment. In phase III clinical trials, mean eosinophil counts were 696 cells/¬µL (n=245) and 624 cells/¬µL (n=244) at baseline. Following 52 weeks of reslizumab treatment, eosinophil cells were counted and were reported to be 55 cells/¬µL (92% reduction, n=212) and 496 cells/¬µL (21% reduction, n=212) for the reslizumab and placebo treatment groups, respectively. Furthermore, eosinophil count returned towards baseline in those reslizumab-treated patients who completed a follow-up assessment (n=35, 480 cells/¬µL), approximately 120 days after the last dose of reslizumab. Therefore, reductions of blood eosinophils were related to reslizumab serum levels. ===Pharmacokinetics=== The pharmacokinetic characteristics of reslizumab are similar across the children and adults. Peak serum concentrations are observed at the end of infusion and declines in a biphasic manner. The mean observed accumulation ratio of reslizumab following multiple doses of administration ranged from 1.5 to 1.9-fold. Reslizumab has a volume of distribution of approximately 5 L, clearance of approximately 7 mL/hour, and a half-life of about 24 days. Reslizumab is degraded by enzymatic proteolysis into small peptides and amino acids, as are other monoclonal antibodies. ==History== Reslizumab was initially developed by Chuan-Chu Chou at Schering-Plough and was previously known as SCH-55700. In 1993, Chou and his group at Schering-Plough were granted the patent for the design, cloning and expression of the reslizumab drug. Ception Therapeutics acquired the drug and continued its development under the name CTx55700. In 2010, Ception Therapeutics was acquired by Cephalon for $250 million and the drug continued under development under the codename CEP-38072. In 2011, Teva Pharmaceuticals acquired Cephalon for $6.8 billion and continued the development of reslizumab. == References == Category:Monoclonal antibodies ","title":"Reslizumab"},{"id":"9134276","text":"Yamaha V50 The Yamaha V50 is a digital music workstation introduced in 1989. It combines a sequencer, rhythm machine, a FM synthesis - based sound module and a MIDI keyboard. ==FeaturesThe sequencer=== The internal sequencer has 8 tracks, with an approximate capability of 16000 notes shared between maximum of 8 songs at a time. ===Rhythm machine=== The rhythm machine has 61 PCM samples, with polyphony of 8 samples. The rhythm machine contains 100 preset short rhythm patterns and allows the user to create 100 additional patterns, known as \\"internal patterns\\". The patterns can be assembled into larger rhythm songs. The beauty of the rhythm machine is that you can adjust it \\"on the fly\\" (e.g. stop/start, tempo, volume, pattern select,...) whilst continuing to play a synthe sound patch or performance. You can also let the Rhythm play while you change/edit the synthe's Voice/Performance patch - excellent features for uninterrupted experimentation and live performance. ==The sound module== The FM synthesis provided by the sound module is based on 4 operators that could be chained by selecting one of the 8 available algorithms. Each operator can generate one of the 8 available waveforms. Additionally, in each of the algorithms, operator 4 can be set to modulate itself with a configurable amount of feedback. The sound unit is basically a slightly upgraded variant of the Yamaha TX81Z module, with increased polyphony and other minor tweaks. The synthesis unit has a 16-note polyphony and 8-instrument multitimbral capability. The unit contains 100 preset instruments stored on ROM and an additional 100 user-configurable sounds. Multiple sounds can be layered into so-called performances to provide more interesting sounds than one instrument could provide alone. One common way to use this feature is to include several instances of the same instrument in the same performance while detuning each of them slightly to create a \\"thicker\\" or more lively sound. e.g. you can layer or split (i.e. zone) the keyboard with up to 8 different (or same) \\"Single\\" voice patches to create a \\"Performance\\" patch which can result in very lush, complex and unique tones from just this one instrument. There are 11 \\"tunings\\" available including the standard \\"Equal Temperament\\" - useful if you wish to experiment, or to produce a performance of classical music in the tuning of its day. e.g. Pythagorean, Werckmeister, 1/4 tone,...etc. Microtuning is also available allowing you to specify the pitch of each note to create unique tunings. ==The keyboard== The V50 keyboard consists of 61 keys, covering 5 octaves.

Rovelizumab was developed by Icos to treat patients suffering from haemorrhagic shock. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that suppresses white blood cells which become overly active during shock. During testing the number of patients given the drug was low because rovelizumab had to be delivered within four hours of the injury and consent was required. Often the patient was unconscious and relatives had to be reached to give consent. In June 1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to waive consent requirements in situations where the patient was at high risk of dying and relatives could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed waiving consent, the FDA approved the proposal in August 1998 for five medical centers. Development of rovelizumab was halted in April 2000 when interim data from phase III clinical trials did not meet Icos's goals. The company's goals for rovelizumab included reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death-rate from shock at 28 days. Rovelizumab was also being tested for treating heart attack, multiple sclerosis, and stroke, and was being explored as a treatment for cerebral vasospasm, head trauma, kidney transplantation, and restenosis. Multiple companies have tried to develop anti-CD18 drugs, but none of them have been successful. Among them are Genentech's erlizumab, and two drugs developed by Protein Design Labs and Centocor. Although trials in humans have not gone well, the research of anti- CD18 drugs in animals has been encouraging.

The unique anti-IgE antibody was designed to target immunoglobulin E (IgE) and IgE-expressing B lymphocytes specifically, without binding to IgE already bound by the high affinity IgE receptors on mast cells and basophils. Talizumab was tested in clinical trials at National Jewish Medical and Research Center and other medical centers and allergy clinics across the U. S. and shown to be able to prevent allergic reactions to accidental exposure to peanuts, which is contained in many kinds of foods. ==History== The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \\"fast-tracked\\" TNX-901. A drug is given a fast-track status if it meets a medical need not currently being met by any medication. TNX-901 was developed by Houston-based Tanox, started by two biomedical scientists, Nancy T. Chang and Tse Wen Chang, in 1986. There was a legal dispute whether Tanox had the right to independently develop TNX-901 under the tripartite partnership formed by Tanox, Novartis, and Genentech in 1996. Trials of TNX-901 for treating extreme peanut sensitivity, which affect children especially, were unfortunately mired in legal battles.Pollack A. Wrangling May Delay Peanut Allergy Drug.

How Genentech, Novartis Stifled A Promising Drug. Wall Street Journal April 5, 2005. http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB111265511632497703-search,00.html In the original collaborative agreement signed between Tanox and Ciba-Geigy in 1990 to co-develop the anti-IgE antibody program, the two companies agreed to select a top candidate for manufacturing process development and clinical trials. The agreement stipulated that Tanox could develop any ‚Äúleft-over‚Äù antibody candidate, but when and if Tanox sought a corporate partner to further develop and commercialize the product, Ciba-Geigy would have the right of first refusal. (Note Ciba-Geigy merged with Sandoz to form Novartis in 1996.) When Genentech joined in the anti-IgE program in 1996, the original 2-way Tanox-Ciba Geigy agreement was expanded to a tripartite agreement. A joint steering committee formed by members from the three companies chose omalizumab (trade name Xolair) developed by Genentech for further development, on the basis that it had a better developed manufacturing process than TNX-901. Tanox took a position that because the original clause concerning its right to develop a left-over candidate was not explicitly removed in the tripartite agreement, it should still have a right to do so with the recognition that its corporate partners, Novartis and Genentech, would still command right of first refusal on the product Tanox developed. Based on this position, Tanox proceeded with a phase II clinical trial of TNX-901 on peanut allergy, with the understanding that this indication was important and urgent, but was not on the top agenda of clinical testing planned by the steering committee. As the issue on Tanox‚Äôs right to develop TNX-901 was moved to the legal stage, a judge of a California court remarked that Tanox should have such a right, but then passed the case for arbitration.http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Court+Stays+Lawsuit+Against+Tanox,+Inc.%3B+Judge+Returns+Parties+to...-a080862592 The arbitration panel eventually ruled the case in favor of the giant partners, Genentech and Novartis, in 2002. The managers of Tanox agonized over the decision, in the midst of very positive results from the phase II studies of TNX-901 on peanut allergy. The media hailed the success of the trials, but expressed outcry over the fate of the TNX-901 program on peanut allergy.Delayed help for peanut allergy sufferers - A new drug has been shown to offer protection against this sometimes fatal malady. Further testing, however, is stuck in a legal limbo. Business Week March 10, 2003. http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2003/tc20030310_8777_tc024.htmRobbins- Roth C. A David Vs. Goliath Biotech Story, With Goliath Winning. BioWorld Today April 8, 2005. http://www.bioventureconsultants.com/4-8-05_Article.html Ten years have passed, since Tanox was forced to put its TNX-901 program on the shelf. In the meantime, a phase II clinical trial of omalizumab on peanut allergy failed to finish, as a couple of patients suffered anaphylactic reactions during the testing for baseline sensitivity for peanut allergens and the trial had to be suspended. ==Mechanism== TNX-901 is a humanized anti-IgE antibody with a unique set of binding specificity to human IgE. The therapeutic anti-IgE antibodies, like TNX-901, were designed to neutralize free IgE in the blood and in interstitial space and to target IgE-expressing B lymphocytes via their surface B cell receptors, without triggering the activation of mast cells and basophils, which bear on their surface high affinity IgE receptors, which are essentially fully occupied and armed by IgE. If an ordinary anti-IgE antibody, which does not possess the unique set of binding specificity of CGP51901 or TNX-901, were injected into a human subject, it would probably invariably induce an extensive scale of mast cell and basophil activation and hence the development of anaphylactic shocks. TNX-901 can intervene with the IgE-mediated allergic pathway at the top of the pathway, and hence prevent the down-stream release of pharmacological mediators from activated basophils and mast cells. It was also discovered in the early clinical trials that the depletion of IgE in the blood gradually cause the down-regulation of the high-affinity IgE receptors on basophils, mast cells, and dendritic cells, rendering these cells insensitive to allergen activation. ==Research== The chimeric form of TNX-901, was made prior to TNX-901 by Tanox in 1988-1989 and later referred to as CGP51901 (CGP is an acronym for ‚ÄúCiba-Geigy Product‚Äù) after Tanox established a partnership with Ciba-Geigy in 1990. CGP51901 was the first anti-IgE antibody to receive an IND (‚ÄúInvestigational New Drug‚Äù) approval from the U.S. FDA to be tested in human subjects. Under the collaborative agreement between Tanox and Ciba-Geigy, cGMP-grade CGP51901 was manufactured in a 500-liter bioreactor facility in Tanox in Houston, Texas and a Phase I trial on individuals with pollen sensitivity was carried out in Southampton, UK in 1991-1992, and a Phase II trial on patients with severe sensitivity to mountain cedar pollens was performed in three medical centers in Texas in 1994-1995. Based on the safety and efficacy data of these two trials, a ‚Äúswitch-over‚Äù study was performed on TNX-901 and subsequently a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, and multi-center trial of TNX-901 was designed and performed on patients with extreme sensitivity to peanuts. The clinical trial results indicate that with the administration of TNX-901, patients, who could tolerate an average of half a peanut before the treatment, were able to ingest up to 9 peanuts before they started to have allergic reactions. Therefore, TNX-901 cannot cure peanut allergy, but could protect patients from the often violent and life- threatening reactions upon the accidental exposure to peanut. Note that this clinical study was not done on patients who were known to develop deadly anaphylactic reactions to minute traces of peanut. ==Similar drugs== Another anti-IgE antibody with identical antigen-binding characteristics is already on the market for allergic asthma, under the trade name Xolair (omalizumab). Omalizumab is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, which was placed in a development program under a tripartite partnership formed by Tanox, Novartis, and Genentech in 1996. The problem is that Xolair has not been approved for use in food allergies. One could obtain a prescription for Xolair without it being approved for use in allergies, but most health insurance will not cover it without FDA approval, meaning it could cost on the order of $1000 a month for a patient. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Monoclonal antibodies Category:Experimental drugs ","title":"Talizumab"},{"id":"9134356","text":"Canton of Marseille ‚Äì Saint-Mauront is a former canton located within the commune of Marseille in the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne department of France.

It is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that plays an important role in immune response and is implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, multiple myeloma and prostate cancer. It was developed by Hoffmann‚ÄìLa Roche and Chugai. ==Medical uses== The drug is administered by monthly intravenous infusions. An infusion takes about an hour. An alternative formulation for subcutaneous injection was approved in October 2013. ===Rheumatoid arthritis=== Tocilizumab is used for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, applied in combination with methotrexate, if other drugs like disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and TNF alpha blockers have proven to be ineffective or were not tolerated. It can be used as a monotherapy for patients who do not tolerate methotrexate. The drug slows down the progression of the disease and can improve physical function of patients. ===Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis=== The treatment of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is similar to RA treatment: tocilizumab is combined with methotrexate unless the latter is not tolerated. General safety and effectiveness is established for children of two years and older. In 2011 the US FDA approved tocilizumab for the treatment of the orphan disease, active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), a rare and severe form of arthritis affecting children. ===Castleman's disease=== In Japan, tocilizumab is also approved for the treatment of Castleman's disease, a rare benign tumor of B cells. ===Neuromyelitis optica === Early case reports suggest tocilizumab might be effective in otherwise refractory neuromyelitis optica (NMO, Devic's disease). ===Giant cell arteritis=== In May 2017, tocilizumab was FDA approved for giant cell (temporal) arteritis. ===Cytokine release syndrome=== On 30 August 2017, the FDA approved tocilizumab for cytokine release syndrome, a side effect of CAR-T cell therapies. ==Pregnancy and lactation== No clinical studies evaluating the risk for fetuses are available. A study using large doses of tocilizumab in pregnant animals has found an increased likelihood for spontaneous abortion. It is not known whether the drug is secreted into the breast milk, nor if this would pose a risk for the nursling. ==Contraindications== The application of tocilizumab is contraindicated during acute infections, as well as under latent tuberculosis. ==Adverse effects== The most common adverse effects observed in clinical trials were upper respiratory tract infections (more than 10% of patients), nasopharyngitis (common cold), headache, and high blood pressure (at least 5%). The enzyme alanine transaminase was also elevated in at least 5% of patients, but in most cases without symptoms. Elevated total cholesterol levels were common. Among the less common side effects were dizziness, various infections, as well as reactions of the skin and mucosae like mild rashes, gastritis and mouth ulcer. Rare but severe reactions were gastrointestinal perforations (0.26% in six months) and anaphylaxis (0.2%). ==Interactions== There are no certain interactions with other drugs. The blood plasma levels of simvastatin were reduced by 57% after a single dose of tocilizumab, but it is not known whether this is clinically relevant. A possible mechanism is that the elevated IL-6 levels of patients with RA suppress the biosynthesis of various cytochrome P450 enzymes, notably CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Tocilizumab lowers IL-6 and thus normalises cytochrome levels, increasing the metabolization of simvastatin (and possibly other cytochrome metabolised drugs). ==Mechanism of action== Besides other functions, interleukin 6 (IL-6) is involved in the development of immunological and inflammatory reactions. Some autoimmune diseases like RA are associated with abnormally high IL-6 levels. Tocilizumab binds soluble as well as membrane bound interleukin-6 receptors, hindering IL-6 from exerting its pro-inflammatory effects. It has been noted that the membrane bound form and soluble form of the IL-6 receptor may have different effects in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis with the soluble form being more implicated in disease progression. ==History== Interleukin 6 and its receptor were discovered and cloned at Osaka University, Japan, by Tadamitsu Kishimoto in the 1980s. In 1997, Chugai Pharmaceuticals began the clinical development of tocilizumab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Clinical studies for Castleman's disease and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis started in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Hoffmann‚ÄìLa Roche co- developed the drug due to a license agreement in 2003. Data presented in 2008 showed the effectiveness of tocilizumab in combination therapy with methotrexate for RA treatment. In further studies, it was effective and generally well tolerated when administered either as monotherapy or in combination with conventional DMARDs in adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. In June 2005, tocilizumab was approved in Japan for Castleman's disease. In January 2009, the drug was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as RoActemra for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis under the mentioned restrictions. On 11 January 2010, it was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) as Actemra for the same purpose. Tocilizumab was approved by Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration on 27 May 2009 and was listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from 1 August 2010. In New Zealand, tocilizumab was approved for distribution in July 2009, and Pharmac approved subsidising it with special authority restrictions on 1 July 2013 for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and 1 July 2014 for rheumatoid arthritis. The FDA approved tocilizumab for the treatment of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis for children from two years of age in April 2011, and the EMA followed in August the same year. Tocilizumab is marketed by Chugai in some countries, especially in Japan and other Asian countries, and jointly by Chugai and Roche (Hoffmann‚ÄìLa Roche's holding company) in others, for example Great Britain, France and Germany. ==Research== The intensity of IL-6 in cancer cells from people with ovarian cancer is associated with poor prognosis, and in cell culture a different anti-IL-6 antibody (siltuximab) reduced IL-6 signaling and showed favorable effects in an animal model of the disease; however, the drug showed no clear effects when tested in a phase II clinical trial in people with advanced ovarian cancer. The trial investigators later showed that in high-grade ovarian cancer cells, anti-IL6 antibodies reduced the activation of STAT3 (its major downstream transcription factor), leading to increased activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, which is thought to confer resistance to several cancer therapies. The investigators then showed that inhibiting this pathway with the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib inhibited tumor growth was in cell culture and animals of the disease, offering a potential rationale for combining anti-IL6 antibodies with gefitinib to treat advanced- stage ovarian cancer. Tocilizumab is being studied for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Tocilizumab is currently under evaluation in a multicenter clinical trial (ALL-IN) for the prevention of acute cellular rejection in status post heart transplant patients. === COVID-19 === China's National Health Commission included the use of tocilizumab in guidelines to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. In March 2020, China approved tocilizumab for the treatment of inflammation in patients with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. , there is no evidence whether this treatment is effective. Chinese health officials say that only 21 patients have been asked to use this medicine. The same month, a randomized study, at 11 locations in China was conducted to compare favipiravir versus tocilizumab versus both. On 11 March 2020, Italian physician Paolo Ascierto reported that tocilizumab appeared to be effective in three severe cases of COVID-19 in Italy. On 14 March 2020, three of the six treated patients in Naples had shown signs of improvement prompting the Italian Pharmacological Agency (AIFA) to expand testing in five other hospitals. Roche and the WHO have each launched separate trials for its use in severe COVID-19 cases. Tocilizumab was among the drugs noted as treatments for COVID-19 in a study of major hospitals in the U.S. that determined that abnormal liver tests were occurring in most hospitalized patients with COVID‚Äê19 and may be associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Several medications used in the treatments during the study were found to be associated with peak hospitalization liver transaminase elevations >5x ULN. Tocilizumab was significantly associated in the relationship between the drugs used to treat the disease and abnormal liver tests, which has prompted studies being conducted to determine whether the abnormal tests were due to the disease or to drug-induced liver injury, according to Michael Nathanson, director of the Yale Liver Center and co-author of the study.Belli, Brita, Strong link found between abnormal liver tests and poor COVID-19 outcomes, Yale News, August 6, 2020 Roche announced on 29 July 2020 that its randomized double-blind trial of tocilizumab in the treatment of pneumonia in Covid patients had shown no benefits of the drug. ==See also== * Anti-IL-6 medications ==References== == External links == * Category:Immunosuppressants Category:Orphan drugs Category:Hoffmann-La Roche brands Category:Genentech brands ","title":"Tocilizumab"},{"id":"9134399","text":"African Rifles may refer to: * The King's African Rifles (KAR), a multi- battalion British colonial regiment raised from the various British possessions in East Africa, created in 1902 *The East African Rifles, a British unit created in 1895 that was later merged into the KAR in 1902 *The East African Mounted Rifles, a volunteer unit of white Africans during the First World War, created in 1914 * The Rhodesian African Rifles or (RAR), the oldest regiment in the Rhodesian Army, created in 1940 *The Royal African Rifles, a 1953 adventure film ","title":"African Rifles"},{"id":"9134413","text":"Blac Monks was an American southern hip hop group from Houston, Texas, consisting of 3-2, D.A. and Awol.

Main influences for the band in the early days were The Beatles, The Smiths and The Who, and with their second album in 2009, titled Songs for the Fallen Apart, a more epic and type of songwriting in the likeness of 1970s Bruce Springsteen, The Killers and The Clash made its presence noted. ==Career== Molotov Jive during a concert in 2007 Molotov Jive were signed to Swedish independent record label Bonnier Amigo Music after their first show outside their native Karlstad, a \\"battle of the bands\\" type show at Nalen in Stockholm. In March 2006 their first single was released, \\"The Luck You Got\\" which got a notable amount of airplay on Swedish radio, followed in June by second single \\"Made In Spain\\". On 25 October 2006 Molotov Jive released their debut album When It's All Over I'll Come Back Again, which included \\"Made In Spain\\" and for which they shot the video for in Barcelona, Spain. The band went on to release two further singles, \\"Weight off my Shoulder\\", and the free download single \\"Valentines Day\\" on 14 February 2007. In 2007, the band made their first foray into mainland Europe with shows in London followed by a sizeable support tour with Sugarplum Fairy. This resulted in European deals for When It's Over I'll Come Back Again, which went on to be released there in October 2007. Their first major headline European tour coincided with the release of the album, followed in January 2008 with another support tour with UK band The Enemy. While recordings of second album Songs For The Fallen Apart were taking place with producer Tom Hakava, in Decibel Studio in Stockholm in 2008, Molotov Jive toured with many UK acts, including Arctic Monkeys, The Coral, Razorlight, Dirty Pretty Things and US punk band The Dirtbombs. On 29 January 2009, Molotov Jive released second album in Scandinavia, including the single \\"Paint The City Black\\", which received airplay on Swedish radio throughout 2009. Reviews of Songs For The Fallen Apart noted that the band were leaving the garage rock sound for something more epic and grandiose. It was released in mainland Europe on the 26 June, through Indigo/Strangeways. The band embarked on another headline tour of Europe in October and November 2009. As of 2010, the band have spent their time writing for their third album and played occasional live shows. Most notably supporting Suede at Cirkus in Stockholm on December 1, 2010. This show was the first time Molotov Jive performed as a five piece band, adding synths and extra percussion to their outfit. In the spring of 2011, Molotov Jive went to North America to work with American producer Sylvia Massy on their third record, to be titled Storm. The album was recorded at Radiostar Studios in northern California during five weeks. With Storm, Molotov Jive took their music in a different direction which has been described by critics as post punk or shoegazing. The first single from the upcoming third record, \\"Friendship\\", started getting airplay on Swedish national radio during February 2012. Storm was released on March 5, 2012, on vinyl and digital formats, through Supernova Records. A week after Storm 's release the band's official website announced that Molotov Jive would be supporting the Scottish band Glasvegas on a string of dates in Scandinavia. ==Band members== *Anton Annersand ‚Äì Lead vocals, songwriting, rhythm guitar, piano and organ *Anders Wennberg ‚Äì Bass player and backing vocals (also plays trumpet on the single, \\"Paint The City Black\\") *Johan Hansson ‚Äì Drums, percussion and backing vocals *Oskar Olofsson ‚Äì Lead guitar ==References== ==External links== * Molotov Jive's web site * Molotov Jive on Myspace Category:Bonnier Amigo Music Group artists Category:Swedish indie rock groups ","title":"Molotov Jive"},{"id":"9134493","text":"Canton of Marseille-Verduron is a former canton located within the commune of Marseille in the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne department of France.

Chen Yueyi's father was Chen Shanti (Èô≥Â±±Êèê), and she was his eighth daughter. Chen Shanti was initially a servant of the Northern Wei general Erzhu Zhao, and after Erzhu's defeat by Gao Huan became a servant to Gao. He served as a general in several administrations of Northern Qi, founded by Gao's son Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi, eventually achieving the title of Prince of Xieyang. After Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou destroyed Northern Qi in 577, Chen Shanti became a Northern Zhou general and carried the title of Duke of Xiyang. In 579, Chen Yueyi was selected to be an imperial consort for Emperor Xuan, with the title of Defei (Âæ∑Â¶É). A month later, Emperor Xuan passed the throne to his son Emperor Jing and took an atypical title for a retired emperor, \\"Emperor Tianyuan\\" (Â§©ÂÖÉÁöáÂ∏ù, Tianyuan Huangdi).

The troupe, which employs about a dozen performers, uses live, original music paired with old-style circus performances, heavily influenced by cabaret and vaudeville acts. The shows are conceived for adults and usually feature some mature content. The troupe first performed at the Seattle Fringe Theatre Festival, but soon branched out to other venues around the U.S., including a U.S. tour in 2005. Their local and touring shows, with names like \\"Bracing Curative,\\" \\"Eat Circus,\\" \\"The Beer, Bread & Cheese Cabaret,\\" \\"A Raree Show,\\" and \\"Gallimaufry: An Evening of Jiggery-Pokery,\\" played to sold-out audiences.

In 2007 a house-based approach to student support was developed which includes \\"vertical\\" tutor groups, meaning that form groups have a mix of ages which encourages students to have stronger relationships with other members of the school, not exclusively their own year. In 2017, the school removed the vertical tutoring system but decided to keep the current houses. After removing this system, there are only eight schools nationally that still use the vertical tutor system. == Students == The majority of students join Harlington from three Bedfordshire middle schools: Arnold, Parkfields and Robert Bloomfield. The students mainly live in the villages near Harlington including: Harlington, Toddington, Harlington Mill, Sharpenhoe, Barton-le-Clay, Silsoe, Clophill, Westoning, Greenfield, Flitwick, Luton, Chalton, and Streatley. Most students join the school in year 9, aged 13. They start their GCSE courses in year 9 and take the GCSE exams in years 10 and 11, aged 15 or 16. Some students choose to continue attending the school following their GCSEs and join a large sixth form of over 420. == Houses == As of September 2007, the forms are not sorted by year group (age) but rather there are six houses each with 10 forms. The houses are named after Greek mythical creatures and gods, Apollo, Europa, Hercules, Midas, Pegasus, Theseus. The forms are named after the letters from HARLINGTON other than the repeated N which is replaced by the U from Upper. The name of an individual form is the initial letter of the house and the initial letter of HARLINGTOU, for example the first form in Pegasus would be PH then PA, PR etc. With the new house structure, there are a number of responsibility positions available for students to fill, e.g. House captain, and editor of the house newspaper. *Apollo (yellow) *Europa (blue) *Hercules (red) *Midas (gold/orange) *Pegasus (purple) *Theseus (green) == New buildings == Between October 2003 and April 2006, the school underwent a major building and refurbishment programme as part of the Mid-Bedfordshire PFI scheme. In November 2006, the Mid- Bedfordshire PFI scheme was officially opened by the Queen during a visit to Bedfordshire at neighbouring Samuel Whitbread Upper School. == Science College and Academy == In September 2006 the school gained specialist Science College status. The school continues to teach the full range of National Curriculum subjects, but uses its strength and expertise in Science and Mathematics to support other schools and the local community. The school has also been selected by the DfES and the Specialist Schools Trust to become a Deep Support Hub for the Eastern Region. On 1 March 2012, Harlington Upper School officially became an academy. == External links == *Official school website Category:Upper schools in Central Bedfordshire District Category:Academies in Central Bedfordshire District Category:Educational institutions established in 1973 Category:1973 establishments in England ","title":"Harlington Upper School"},{"id":"9134679","text":"This is a partial list of Indian rock-cut temples by state or union territory. ==Andhra Pradesh== Akkanna Madanna caves, Vijayawada Bojjannakonda Caves and Hilltop Monastery, Anakapalle, Visakhapatnam district Caves at Guntupalle Bhairava Kona * Akkanna Madanna Caves, Vijayawada * Belum Caves, Kurnool district * Bhairavakona Caves, Hindu temple caves located at Ambavaram Kothapalli, CS Pur Mandal, Prakasam district * Bodhikonda and Ghanikonda Caves, Ramatheertham, Vizianagaram district * Bojjannakonda and Lingalakonda, Anakapalle, Visakhapatnam district * Borra Caves, Aruku Valley, Visakhapatnam district * Guntupalle Caves (near Dwaraka Tirumala), West Godavari district, popularly known as \\"Andhra Ajanta\\", believed to pre-date even the Ajanta and Ellora caves of Maharashtra * Moghalrajpuram caves * Undavalli caves, Guntur district ==Assam== Cave temple at Maibong * Longthaini Noh, Maibong, Dima Hasao * Dudhnath, jogighopa, South Salmara == Bihar == * Son Bhandar Caves * Barabar Caves * Lomas Rishi Caves ==Goa== * Harvalem Caves, Sanquelim, Goa 403505, circa. 6th century. ==Gujarat== * Dhank Caves * Junagadh Buddhist Cave Groups, Junagadh district * Bava Pyara Caves * Kadia Dungar Caves * Khambhalida Caves * Sana Caves * Siyot Caves, Lakhpat Taluka, Kutch district * Talaja Caves, Bhavnagar district ==Haryana== None of these have been studied scientifically yet. * Dhosi Hill cave temple in Aravalli Mountain Range, Narnaul, Mahendragarh district * Nar Narayan Cave Temple in Sivalik Hills range, Yamuna Nagar district * Tosham Hill cave temple in Aravalli Mountain Range, Hisar-Tosham road, Bhiwani district ==Himachal Pradesh== Rock Cut Temple, Masroor *Masroor Rock Cut Temple 15 rock-cut temples in the Indo-Aryan style are richly carved.

Akin to a journal and published in various series, each number of the ANRW comprises scholarly essays contributed by individual authors. The essays are in various modern European languages, but are primarily written in German or English. The series is currently published in its second series (Part 2), the series (that is, relating to the period of the Roman Principate). ==History of the work== The series began in 1972, intended as a Festschrift to commemorate the seventy-fifth birthday of Joseph Vogt, a German classicist and historian. Since then, it has grown with time beyond its original remit, and is now more of an encyclopedia, or a serial compendium. The series seeks to treat aspects of the Roman world, as well as their continuation and reception in the Middle Ages and into modernity, providing a guide to current research. The series is edited by (Parts 1 and 2) and Wolfgang Haase (Part 2), and is published by Walter de Gruyter of Berlin and New York. ==Structure== Individual volumes of the ANRW are written like handbooks. More than one thousand scholars have contributed to the series. Part 1 (), in four volumes, covered topics of the period from the founding of Rome to the end of the Republic. Part 2 (, published since 1974) is concerned with the imperial period. Part 3 (), on late antiquity, is in planning. A unified index (\\"Register\\") will eventually complete the work. Each Part is published in multiple volumes, across six systematic sections: *1. Political History; *2. Law; *3. Religion; *4. Language and Literature; *5. Philosophy and the Sciences; and *6.

He is known for his role in having authored an important account on the early Taiping rebellion and for his role in establishing Christian missions in Guangdong province. He also laid the foundations for the study of the Hakka dialect in the West. He is the younger brother of the Swedish chemist Nils Peter Hamberg. ==Early life== Hamberg was the son of a sea captain and worked as a businessman, after graduating from school. In 1844, he left his trade to join the Basel Mission and spent the following two years in training at a missions school in Switzerland. ==Missionary work in China== In 1846, Hamberg was sent to China, where he arrived on March 19 the following year and started to work in the Guangdong mission, where he worked to convert members from the Hakka community. He also worked out a draft of the first description of the Hakka dialect, which provided the foundation to D. MacIver's Hakka dictionary. Hamberg initially worked under the influential German missionary Karl G√ºtzlaff, but Hamberg gradually grew skeptical of G√ºtzlaff's strategy of mass conversions; instead he advocated a more cautious approach, which in due course would bring him into conflict with G√ºtzlaff and with the Basel Mission. After the death of G√ºtzlaff, Hamberg was vindicated and he continued to work under the Basel Mission. ==Hamberg and the Taiping Rebellion== In 1852, Hamberg met Hong Xiuquan's cousin Hong Ren'gan, who had been separated from the rebellion and fled to Hong Kong. Hong Ren'gan also provided Hamberg with important information on the Taiping rebellion, which formed the basis of a book Hamberg later published on the rebellion. The book was the first extensive account on the Taiping rebellion in a Western language and remains an important source on the early life of Hong Xiuquan. Hamberg died in Hong Kong in 1854. ==Works== *Report regarding the Chinese Union at Hongkong.

Although he made it past the five-yard-line before retreating, Jim Ferguson was pushed back from the three and landed in the end zone; the nearest official awarded a controversial safety. After the free kick, Stanford stopped Michigan and forced a punt. Trailing by two points with 1:48 left from his own 22-yard-line, a sleep-deprived Bunce completed five of six passes, driving 64 yards in eight plays to the Michigan 14 to set up a game-winning field goal attempt with sixteen seconds left. From just inside the right hashmark, placekicker Rod Garcia split the uprights from 31 yards and Stanford won, 13‚àí12. Bunce was named Rose Bowl most valuable player, after completing 24 of 44 attempts for 290 yards and no interceptions. Earlier in the week, he was also awarded the 1971 W.J. Voit Memorial Trophy as the outstanding football player on the Pacific Coast. ==Professional career== In the 1972 NFL Draft, Bunce was selected in the twelfth round (307th overall) by the Washington Redskins, but opted to join the Canadian Football League, where he signed a three-year contract with the British Columbia Lions of Vancouver and planned to attend medical school at the University of British Columbia. He played one season in 1972, then left football and attended Stanford Medical School, where he received an M.D. degree in 1977 and went on to start a successful practice as an orthopedic surgeon in Palo Alto. He also served as team doctor for Stanford's football team from 1982 to 1992. Bunce died of a heart attack at the age of 54 while vacationing near Santa Cruz. ==See also== * List of NCAA major college football yearly total offense leaders ==Video== *You Tube ‚Äì 1972 Rose Bowl ‚Äì NBC Sports telecast ==References== ==External links== *Stanford University Athletics ‚Äì Dr. Don Bunce dies * Category:BC Lions players Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Stanford Cardinal football players Category:Canadian football quarterbacks Category:People from Redwood City, California Category:Sportspeople from the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Stanford Medical School alumni Category:1949 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Players of American football from California ","title":"Don Bunce"},{"id":"9134806","text":"Canton of Marseille-Montolivet is a former canton located within the commune of Marseille in the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne department of France.

It is directed by Jun Kawagoe (previously known for New Getter Robo and Innocent Venus). The show began airing on the satellite network WOWOW on April 5, 2007 at 11:30 p.m. JST. Press material describes the show as \\"A simple tale of 'Good versus Evil' while at the same time [being] a robot anime created for the sake of the adult core audience.\\" On February 19, 2007, it was announced that the JAM Project song \\"STORMBRINGER\\" would be the show's opening theme. ==Plot== The story of Koutetsushin Jeeg takes place fifty years after the original and features a new cast of characters‚Äîprimarily the new main character Kenji Kusanagi, a high school student and motorcycle racer who becomes Koutetsushin Jeeg to fight the sudden reappearance of \\"Haniwa Genjin\\" (\\"Haniwa Phantom Gods\\", or clay robots) from the Great Jama Kingdom ruled by Queen Himika. Other characters include Tsubaki Tamashiro (granddaughter of Miwa Uzuki) and Kyo Misumi, Kenji's partners. Other main characters from the original series also appear. ==Background== 1975, Kyushu. The war against the Great Jama Kingdom is turning against the Japanese Security Forces. During a violent clash between Queen Himika and her generals against the first Jeeg, piloted by Hiroshi Shiba, the bronze bell embedded within Jeeg activates and he is transported to the crater of an extinct volcano. There, he grasps a giant sword, creating an energy vortex that surrounds the entire island. Dark clouds swirl and Kyushu is engulfed in an impenetrable space, later dubbed the \\"zone.\\" All communication with Kyushu ceases. As years go by with no change in the zone recorded, people and even the world's governments lose their interest in the zone, and the world moves on. The Japanese Government, however, decides to build a new Build Base to watch over the zone in preparation for a possible attack. ==CharactersBuild Base=== * - 17 years old. The main protagonist of the series. A high school student who is also a proficient motorcycle racer and martial artist. He and Kyo are HMB (Hyper Motor Bike) racers for Team Shiba but despite this they are clearly rivals. He becomes the pilot for Koutetsushin Jeeg when a Haniwa Genjin awakens and threatens his town. He is not known for being a great thinker with him usually acting perversely around women and rashly in battle. He also has an incredible appetite and is always seen in the cafeteria eating huge amounts of food after each battle. He has a soft spot for his childhood friend, Tsubaki. : * - 17 years old. A childhood friend of Kenji, she attends the same high school and is in the same class as Kenji and Kyo. She lives in a shrine with her grandmother and serves as a shrine maiden. She also works part-time at the Build Base and is Kyo's co- pilot on the Big Shooter. She is responsible for providing Kenji with the Jeeg parts. As a child she often teased Kenji and made him cry, and lately he often infuriates her, but she genuinely cares for him until she starts behaving with typical tsundere violent attitude. : * - 17 years old. Kyo is rather mysterious, and together with his good looks is the object of affection of many girls in high school. He works at the Build Base as the pilot of the Big Shooter. He has been working at the Build Base much longer than Tsubaki once believed. He and Kenji are clearly rivals in the sport of HMB and he always pushes him the hardest. He also harbors a secret that Kenji and Tsubaki do not know of, but which he will reveal to them near the end of the series. : * - Formerly known as , or Micchi, she was the pilot for the original Big Shooter 50 years before, providing the Jeeg parts for the then Jeeg, Hiroshi Shiba. She was shot down by Himika and ended up outside of Kyushu when the zone was erected. She never saw Hiroshi again. Now 50 years later she is the grandmother to Tsubaki, and when the forces of Himika seem to return to life, she takes her place as commander of the new Build Base. She has watched over Kenji and Tsubaki all through their lives. : * - The father of the original Jeeg, Hiroshi Shiba. He is a competent and an extremely gifted scientist. While on an archaeological dig in 1975, he unearthed a case bearing a bronze bell. The bell contained immense power and Senjiro incorporated this power into the mighty Jeeg, to battle the Great Jama Kingdom. After escaping Kyushu, he used a second bell to create a new Jeeg, waiting for the day to prevent the Great Jama Kingdom from rising to conquer the Earth once more. He had the new Build Base built on the coastline overlooking the zone. In the original series and the manga, Professor Shiba is actually killed very early in the series, this has been retconned. : *Build Angels - Three women who are Build Base's primary defence as well as flying support for Jeeg and Big Shooter. They are also sent on reconnaissance missions earlier on in the series. Two of the members, and , came from the Japanese Defence Force on Kyushu island and were the last surviving pilots of their squadron of F-4s. When the zone started to close in on them, they decided to make a break for the outside world and gunned their jet through the storm clouds. They were able to break through, but had to ditch their ruined fighter jet into the sea. However, they were shocked to discover that in the time it took for them to break through the still forming barrier, 50 years had passed. While undergoing debriefing, they were introduced to an older Senjiro Shiba and a young woman with an eyepatch who would become their commanding officer, Captain . The three women would join together to form the Build Angels. * - The one called the \\"Original Jeeg\\", Hiroshi is a Cyborg Human who fought alongside Miwa 50 Years Ago but with a price of losing Miwa to the Zone. After 50 Years, he was reunited with Miwa, appeared alongside Kenji and the others to permanently finish the Great Jama Kingdom once and for all. His ability is Change Cyborg, which lets him change his form to Jeeg's head which then connected to the Original Jeeg Parts provided by the Big Shooter. : ===Haniwa Empire=== *Queen Himika - The queen of the Haniwa Empire and creator of the phantom gods. She seeks the Bronze Bell as well as revenge against the Build Base for her defeat fifty years ago. At the last episode she fuses with her three subordinates to form an extremely powerful demon named Susanoh. *Ikima - The unofficial leader of Himika's subordinates, is armed with a sword and primarily uses elemental magic based on lightning. *Amaso - One of Himika's three subordinates, appears as a gecko with crystals all over his body he can shoot and primarily uses elemental magic based on fire. *Mimashi - One of Himika's three subordinates, appears to have the left side of his face burnt that primarily uses elemental magic based on water and like Ikima wields a sword. *Taikaengu - A large fortress used by the Haniwa Empire that fires a pair of lasers from its underside. Haniwa Phantoms Haniwa Phantoms serve as the monsters of the week for the series much like in the original series. In episode 12 all of them return to fight both Jeegs on the Moon. They are usually transported by the large manta ray- like ship called the Daikaenguu. *Magura: Appears in episodes 1 and 2. Powers include black eye beam, black eye bolts, mouth fire balls, statue break down, extendable arms, electric pulse, and regeneration. Is later revived and given enhanced speed. Magura highly resembles Neo Ranga and its revived form is similar to Neo Ranga's original form of Ranga. *Mezura: Appears in episode 3.

Is mostly likely based on Horse-Face from Chinese mythology. *Ohkaenguu: Appear through the series starting in episode 4 as the Jamatai Empire's main infantry.

While riding the motorcycle, Kenji can activate the Raikoba's transformation by slamming his fists together and yelling \\"Build Up!\\" (while wearing special yellow gloves emblazoned with a green \\"S\\"). The Raikoba will then transform into the Jeeg's head unit (much like how Hiroshi Shiba transformed into the Jeeg head, except he didn't need a motorcycle since he was a cyborg). Kenji later learns that his own parents were part of the Jeeg project and his father designed Raikoba. ===Big Shooter=== A large jet that houses the Jeeg's body parts and weapons. The Big Shooter is mainly piloted by Kyo who controls the jet's flight and on-board weapons. The \\"Shooter\\" is operated by the co-pilot, Tsubaki. She can shoot the Jeeg parts out of the openings of the jet where they will set up and combine to form Jeeg's body. Unlike the original Big Shooter, Kyo and Tsubaki's jet is actually made of 2 units, the main plane and the shooting unit which attaches underneath. During flight, Big Shooter can also house Raikoba and launch it and its rider like a catapult. Miwa also has her original Big Shooter used in the Anime.  The mecha used during the largest part of the series. When the Raikoba has changed into the head part and the Big Shooter has launched the Jeeg Parts, they combine into Jeeg through the \\"Build up!\\" process. Jeeg's armor is very durable and can take a lot of punishment before any signs of damage are shown. The mecha has various weapons embedded into the design: * Knuckle Bomber: The standard Rocket Punch featured in virtually any Super Robot anime. * Jeeg Beam: A short beam of concentrated light from Jeeg's \\"eyes\\". * Hell Slap: One of Jeeg's hands will become filled with sharp spikes and on the back of the hand a small jet engine will appear, launching the hand forward and delivering a powerful slap. * Jeeg Breaker: Jeeg's chest cavity will open, revealing rows of sharp spikes. Kenji then proceeds to grapple the enemy around the waist and use Jeeg's arms and the chest spikes to crush and break the enemy in two. * Magnet Rope: The green buttons on Jeeg's chest will emit 6 strings of solid light which Kenji can use to capture and bind the enemy. * Spin Storm: Jeeg's ultimate weapon. Emitted from a hole in Jeeg's belly region, a large red/black electromagnetic whirlwind crashes into the targeted enemy, often completely obliterating it. Jeeg is also equippable with various other parts, such as the Earth Parts, Sky Parts, the Mach Drills, Jeeg Bazooka and a Baruba rider mode in which Jeeg sits on the back of Baruba. Kotetsu Jeeg ===Original Jeeg=== Hiroshi's battle form after he changes to the Jeeg Head part plus the Original Jeeg Parts. It retains the same Weapons as the old series, especially the Earth Parts, Sky Parts, the Mach Drills and the Jeeg Bazooka. In Super Robot Wars K, the original Koutetsu Jeeg was renamed \\"Jiigu\\" (Á£ÅÂÅâÂÄ∂) to avoid confusion with the new Koutetsu Jeeg. Kotetsushin Jeeg Ultimate Form  Jeeg's Final Form after Hiroshi sacrificed his Bronze Bell to Kenji to save his life plus the power of Baruba. Called the \\"Steel God\\", it was Jeeg's most powerful form. Its most powerful attack is the \\"Triple Storm\\". ==Staff== *Original Creator: Go Nagai *Director: Jun Kawagoe *Series Composition: Tadashi Hayakawa *Scenario: Shoji Tonoike, Natsuko Takahashi, Yuuko Kakihara *Character Design: Akira Kikuchi *Animation Director: Akira Kikuchi *Mechanical Design: Hiroshi Ogawa *Haniwa Genjin Design: Hiroshi Kobayashi *Art Director: Nobuhito Sakamoto *Color Design: Sachiko Harada *Director of Photography: Yasuhiko Abe *CGI: Shift-R (?) *Editor: Jun Takuma *Background Art: BIC Studio *Photography: RARE TRICK *Sound Director: Yoshikazu Iwanami *Sound Production: Jinnan Studio *Music Producer: Shunji Inoue *Music Production: Lantis *Theme Song Artist JAM PROJECT (OP) *Animation Production: Actas ==Game Appearances== Koutetsushin Jeeg is in the Super Robot Wars game, Super Robot Wars K for the Nintendo DS, as well as the new Super Robot Wars L for the Nintendo DS. ==External links== *Koutetsushin Jeeg Official Website *Information page for Koutetsushin Jeeg on WOWOW's site *Press release at Anime!Anime! * Category:Actas Category:Go Nagai Category:Super robot anime and manga Category:Wowow original programming ","title":"Kotetsushin Jeeg"},{"id":"9134960","text":"Yuan Leshang (; born 565), later Buddhist nun name Huasheng (ËèØÂãù), was a concubine of Emperor Xuan of Northern Zhou, an emperor of the Chinese/Xianbei dynasty Northern Zhou.

The battle concluded with victory for Liu Bang, who proclaimed himself Emperor of China and founded the Han Dynasty. ==Background== The Han forces had earned many major victories against Chu, but they did still not control most of the country. Most of eastern China was still under Chu control. Eventually Xiang Yu was able to reorganize his forces, and strike back at Liu Bang. At this point, major disagreements had occurred between Liu Bang and Han Xin. The primary reasons were because Liu Bang refused to give Han Xin too much control over the Han army, and his refusal to use many of Han Xin's suggestions. As a result, Han Xin withheld his forces in Qi as Liu Bang was under siege from Xiang Yu. Liu Bang was only able to hang on because of the assistance from another excellent military strategist, Zhang Liang. In most battles, Xiang Yu rarely paid sufficient attention to resource logistics. In this battle, Zhang Liang was successful in assaulting Xiang Yu's supply lines, which Xiang Yu did not care much about, and this greatly hurt the Chu army's effectiveness. On the other hand, Zhang Liang was successful in keeping the Han supply lines open. During a conversation, Xiang Yu's archer hit Liu Bang with an arrow, which wounded his lung. However, Liu Bang was able to hide this fact from his own army and Xiang Yu, hence keeping the morale of the Han troops high. Sensing the tension between Liu Bang and Han Xin, Xiang Yu tried to persuade Han Xin to ally with him, or at least to stay neutral in this war. Xiang Yu warned Han Xin that he would be in grave danger if Liu Bang was victorious. Xiang Yu even offered to openly accept Han Xin's Qi as a third nation after Chu and Han. However, due to the past history between the two, Han Xin refused any diplomatic relationship with Xiang Yu. Xiang Yu then threatened to kill Liu Bang's captured father and wife and have them cooked over a fire, to force Liu Bang to surrender. Liu Bang simply replied that since the two had been named 'brothers' (during the earlier years of the revolt against Qin Dynasty) he would be effectively cooking his own father, and that Xiang Yu should not forget to send him a cup of 'their' father's flesh to share as good brothers, but Xiang Yu still did not kill them. At one point, Xiang Yu was about to capture Liu Bang. Finally, Liu Bang agreed with everything that Han Xin requested, and Han Xin finally agreed to help. Later, with the arrival of Han Xin, Liu Bang was able to convince Xiang Yu to agree to a peace treaty. At the end, both parties agreed that the two countries of Han and Chu could co-exist peacefully. Liu Bang's father and wife were returned to Liu Bang. Then, in October 202 BC, Xiang Yu started to move his forces back east. ==The battle== Unbeknownst to Xiang Yu, this was a tactic from Han Xin. The Chu forces had sieged the Han fortress for a long time, leaving them tired. On top of that, Chu troops were getting less food than they needed to fight effectively. When news reached them that the war was over, and that there would be long term peace ahead, they were overjoyed. Han Xin then led many attacks against the joyful Chu forces. In anger, Xiang Yu tried to fight his way back to Liu Bang's fortress, but Han Xin had set up many traps and ambushes along the way. Finally Xiang Yu decided that a quick victory was no longer possible with his low morale troops, and decided to temporarily retreat back to the Chu capital and regroup there. Han Xin knew that he could not let Xiang Yu return to the capital. Han Xin ordered his forces to increase the number of ambushes in order to force the Chu troops into a canyon area near Gaixia, where Xiang Yu could not move at will. As the ambushes increased, Xiang Yu became more and more certain that the main traps would await him inside the canyon. Although his troops were constantly ambushed, he insisted that his troops head straight back to the capital city through the main road as fast as they could, avoiding the side paths through the canyon. Unfortunately for Xiang Yu, fortune turned against him. In one of the ambushes, Xiang Yu's beloved wife, Consort Yu (), who always traveled with his forces, was captured by Han troops. Han Xin immediately ordered that she be taken into the canyon. Xiang Yu, without a choice, sent most of his tired forces back to the capital on the main road, while he himself led a smaller force of 100,000 soldiers into the canyon to save his wife. ==The trap== Xiang Yu hoped to save his wife quickly and to get out before becoming totally entrapped. However, the Han forces, under Han Xin's orders, moved his wife deep into the canyon. By the time he finally reached them and saved his wife, Xiang Yu and his army were already too deep into the canyon to retreat safely. Han Xin then proceeded with his master plan: \\"Ambush from Ten Sides\\" (). Han Xin first fought Xiang Yu face to face, and then retreated. Xiang Yu immediately gave chase, but soon found himself trapped among the numerous Han army. Everywhere Xiang Yu led his forces, more ambushes and traps awaited them. With the repeated ambushes and encirclements, the Han troops began to elongate Xiang Yu's columns and disrupt their formation, allowing their decimation piecemeal. This not only caused heavy casualties for Chu, but also crushed the Chu army's morale, since escaping alive seemed impossible. By December 202 BC, the Chu troops were trapped without supply in the canyon. To further break the Chu army's spirit, Han Xin employed the \\"Chu Song from Four Sides\\" () tactic. He ordered the Han soldiers and captured Chu troops to sing Chu songs. Xiang Yu thought that the Western Chu had been conquered while he had been trapped there, and his cause was lost. Then the Chu soldiers started to desert their camps and escape on their own. Initially Xiang Yu tried with force to stop his troops from leaving the ranks. But when the soldiers and his wife begged of him to let the soldiers go home, Xiang Yu sadly complied. On the same night, Xiang Yu's wife, at age 16, committed suicide, because she considered herself the primary cause of the fall of the Western Chu. This event broke even Xiang Yu's spirit. About 800 loyal soldiers left behind and stayed with Xiang Yu, swearing to fight for him until the very end. Xiang Yu was impressed with their loyalty, and promised to lead them to safety. Most of the soldiers are believed the survivors of the original 8,000 followers of Xiang Yu to fight against Qin Dynasty. At the end of Xiang Yu's life, he said he felt very guilty because he could not bring any of them back to their homelands. ==Xiang Yu's suicide== Han Xin successfully broke the spirits of the Chu troops, which broke the Chu ranks without a fight, as he expected. But the event had an advantage to Xiang Yu. When the Chu army size was still large, they could not move as they wanted, since they were easy to spot. But now Xiang Yu only had 800 men on horses, which allowed him to move much more easily. Xiang Yu was able to break through the traps and ambushes, and escaped the canyon with about a hundred men. Eventually, Han Xin discovered in shock that Xiang Yu had escaped from the entrapped canyon. Upon discovering this, Liu Bang ordered 5,000 elite cavalry to chase down Xiang Yu. Liu Bang ordered the cavalry to not kill Xiang Yu, but to capture him. Unfortunately for Xiang Yu, after he left the canyon, he soon got lost. He tried to ask local people for directions back to Chu, but they pointed him in the wrong direction, with this being possibly intentional given their loyalty towards Han. Xiang Yu then went into the swamps, costing him valuable time for escape. (The fact is disputed, as it is absent from certain Chinese historiographies, and most historians believe it to be fictional.) At the end, Han Xin's elite cavalry chased him to Wu River (ÁÉèÊ±ü). There, Xiang Yu refused to surrender. Xiang Yu had an opportunity to use a local boatman to escape across the river back into Chu territory, but he had too much pride to do so. Instead, he tried to persuade the last 28 of his loyal soldiers to escape, but they all refused and wished to make a last stand against the soldiers that attempted to capture their lord alive. The 28 soldiers killed hundreds of Han Xin's soldiers in the battle. After being seriously wounded, Xiang Yu slit his own throat. ==Aftermath== The loss of Xiang Yu was a major blow to Western Chu. Xiang Yu's brother tried to take command over Chu, but he was mostly a fighter and not a military strategist. No one else in Chu had the army-leading ability of Xiang Yu, and hence no one could win any battles against Han Xin and Zhang Liang. Soon, Chu fortresses started to surrender to Liu Bang, and Liu Bang treated all surrendering Chu forces with respect. Had Xiang Yu successfully retreated into Chu, Chu might have been able to stop Han's advance, at least for a while. Soon after the death of Xiang Yu, Chu would fall to Han. Thus the Han Dynasty, one of the greatest Chinese dynasties, was established. Paul K. Davis writes, \\"Liu Bang‚Äôs victory removed his last rival from power in China and allowed him to establish the Han dynasty.\\"Paul K. Davis: 100 Decisive Battles: From Ancient Times to the Present. Oxford University Press 2001, , pp. 43-47 () ==Debates== *Liu Bang first signed a peace treaty with Xiang Yu, and then ambushed Xiang Yu when he was making his way back to Chu. As a result, many people considered Liu Bang a deceitful man. But it was also possible that Han Xin forced Liu Bang to ignore the peace treaty as part of the deal for him to help Liu Bang. Han Xin had long wanted to defeat Xiang Yu in a decisive battle, as to prove that he was the better strategist. Before the battle, Han Xin's Qi turned down Xiang Yu's offer of an alliance, probably for the same reason. It seemed unlikely that Xiang Yu, being an intelligent man, would have accepted the peace treaty in the first place if Liu Bang was such a dishonest man. *Another debatable part of this story was Xiang Yu going into the canyon to save his wife, even though he knew it was a trap. Militarily, this was a horrible decision. However, it showed that Xiang Yu loved his wife much more than his empire. (Some books say his wife Yu Ji had already committed suicide in front of Xiang Yu before Xiang escaped with his troops after hearing the Chu songs.) *It was possible that the popular game xiangqi (Chinese Chess) was invented by Xiang Yu at the time of the peace treaty. One account stated that Xiang Yu invented xiangqi so that all future battles between Chu and Han can be fought over this game, hence no further human life losses needed to be sustained by either side. In another version of the story, Liu Bang invented xiangqi, not Xiang Yu. In a third version popularized by a recent book from David H. Li, it was Han Xin that invented the game. One common factor cited in these folklores is that in the game of xiangqi, the line which divides the board into 2 parts is marked \\"Chu River\\" on the black side and \\"Han Border\\" on the red side. There is, however, no historical documentation suggesting an actual origin in this era; the first written description of xiangqi's rules appeared much later, in the Tang dynasty. ==See also== * Timeline of the Chu‚ÄìHan Contention ==References== Gaixia Category:History of Anhui Category:Emperor Gaozu of Han ","title":"Battle of Gaixia"},{"id":"9134990","text":"Permendur rods Permendur is a cobalt-iron soft ferromagnetic alloy with equal parts of cobalt and iron which is notable for its high magnetic saturation level. Its saturation flux density of around 2.4 tesla is the highest of any commercially available metal. Coupled with its low coercivity and core losses, its high saturation and permeability makes Permendur useful as magnetic cores in transformers, electric generators and other electrical equipment. The advantage of high saturation in a magnetic core is that it can function at higher magnetic field strengths, so the core can be smaller and lighter for a given magnetic flux and power level. Permendur is used for magnetic cores and pole pieces in lightweight transformers and electric motors used in aircraft. The alloy was invented in 1929 by Gustav Elmen at Bell Telephone Laboratories. Various formulations are sold under different trade names. Cobalt-iron alloys like permendur have very high Curie temperatures so they can function magnetically at high temperatures at which other ferromagnetic materials lose their magnetic properties. They are harder and less ductile than many other iron alloys and so are harder to fabricate, but have superior mechanical strength. Most permendur alloys require heat treatment after fabrication to attain the best magnetic properties. The most important alloys are *Permendur 2V (Vanadium Permendur, Permendur 49): Invented by White and Wahl in 1932, it is approximately 49% cobalt, 49% iron and 2% vanadium. The vanadium improves ductility and workability. *Supermendur (Hiperco 50): Invented by Gould and Wenny in 1957, it has similar composition to Permendur 49 but is grain- oriented so it has a square hysteresis loop and much lower core losses, for better performance in transformers. Current formulations include trace amounts of niobium, silicon and manganese to improve cold-forming properties. The coercivity can be controlled by varying the vanadium concentration. Equiatomic cobalt-iron alloys with more vanadium than permendur, 2-5%, are called Remendur. This is a medium-coercivity magnet material which bridges the gap between Permendur and Vicalloy cobalt-iron magnets with 8-15% vanadium. ==References== Category:Cobalt alloys ","title":"Permendur"},{"id":"9134991","text":"Miklagard ‚Äì The History of the Vikings Volume 2 is an album by power metal band Rebellion, and the second part in their Viking trilogy.

Doherty p58 Formerly known as the Police Reserve Force, the name was changed to Special Patrol Group in 1970 to avoid confusion between the Reserve Force and the newly formed RUC Reserve.Doherty p93 ==History== Each SPG section had 30 members, and was assigned a number and a colour - No.2 Section, based at Tennent Street, off the Shankill Road, Belfast,Asher,Michael.'Shoot to Kill' for example, was designated 'Blue section'. These were the first policemen trained by the British Army in the use of riot equipment and tactics which it had developed since starting Operation Banner in Northern Ireland in 1969.Doherty p134 They were given upgraded weaponry and dispersed in units across the region.Ellison:Smyth p105 The uniformed sections carried out 24 hour anti-terrorist patrols in fibreglass-reinforced 'Makrolon' Land-Rovers, as opposed to the armour-plated Land-Rovers used by some other units. The 'Makrolons' patrolled with open back doors, so that SPG officers could debus rapidly under fire. In addition to Walther PP pistols (later replaced with .357 Magnum Ruger Speed-Six revolvers, which were reckoned to have more 'stopping power' than the standard Walther) and batons, each constable carried either a Sterling submachine gun, a Ruger Mini-14 carbine, or a 7.62 mm L1A1 SLR rifle. A few officers were issued with Lee-Enfield sniper-rifles with telescopic sights, converted to use 7.62 mm ammunition.Asher, Michael 'Shoot to Kill' The six-man teams were trained in special weapons and tactics (SWAT) techniques.ibid ==History== The SPG was the closest thing the RUC had to a dedicated anti-paramilitary unit in the earlier days of the Troubles. The British Army disagreed with its use, believing that army units were better disposed to carry out this role. This was probably an accurate assessment, as, despite the accelerated promotion accorded to Catholic officers in the SPG, many of its members belonged to Protestant Orange Lodges and retained a traditional bias against the Catholic community.Asher, Michael, 'Shoot to Kill' However, the SPG did recruit a number of ex-British Army personnel, including former soldiers of the Parachute Regiment and SAS. ===Bronze section=== Within the SPG another unit was formed and given the name \\"Bronze section\\". Apparently modelled on the Mobile Reaction Force created by Brigadier (later general) Frank Kitson. Whilst, like its army counterpart, not enjoying any notable successes, the formation of Bronze section led directly to the creation of the police \\"E\\" units within Special Branch the best known of which is the E4A department which dealt with humint and E4B which specialised in operations such as ambushes etc. Bronze section itself was replaced by the secretive Special Support Unit (SSU) which was trained by the SAS and intended for direct action against IRA ASU's using humint supplied by E4A. ==Arrests== Two SPG members, John Weir and Billy McCaughey were arrested in 1979 and confessed to paramilitary activities. In June 1980, they were convicted of the murder of Catholic chemist William Strathearn in April 1977. Weir accused his colleagues of participation in 11 killings. An independent inquiry in 2006 found that in 7 out of 8 cases, ballistics tests corroborated his claims, linking the killings to weapons carried by RUC officers. The Barron report found that a group of loyalist paramilitaries, RUC officers, and British military personnel operating out of a farm in Glenanne was responsible for up to 31 killings.Barron throws light on a little shock of horrors, Susan McKay, Sunday Tribune, 14 December 2003. This group become known as the Glenanne gang. The SPG was temporarily restricted from patrolling republican areas such as Crossmaglen and Silverbridge. However, some of the restrictions were lifted after Weir and another RUC officer met Harold McCusker, the local Unionist MP and asked for them to be lifted.\\"RUC men's secret war with the IRA\\". Sunday Times. Liam Clarke. 7 March 1999.The Barron Report and South Armagh According to Toby Harnden, \\"the years when McCaughey and the RUC Special Patrol Group were at large represented the only period when loyalist paramilitaries made forays deep into South Armagh, a republican stronghold\\".Harnden p139 The Armagh SPG was stood down and the remainder of the Special Patrol Group was renamed as the Divisional Mobile Support Unit (DMSU) which had already existed as to supplement the numbers in the SPG. ==Casualties== The first SPG casualty was Const Robert Buckley from Portadown, married with two young daughters. Killed 26 February 1971 when gunmen opened fire from the cover of a rioting mob at Alliance Avenue, Belfast Doherty p98 An SPG constable, Noel Davies, was the first policeman killed by the INLA as he made to drive away a recovered stolen vehicle.Doherty p119 ==Bibliography== *Asher, Michael.

Written by Tony Barwick and directed by Alan Perry, it was first broadcast on 23 February 1968 on ATV Midlands. In this episode, Captain Black engineers the death and reconstruction of a test pilot as part of a plot to destroy the world capital, Futura City. However, his victim is revived in hospital and with Spectrum's help impersonates his Mysteron replacement in a bid to trap Black. ==Plot== World Air Force test pilot Major Gravener is being driven to Slaton Airbase by car when Captain Black, approaching from the opposite direction in a truck, extends a beam with false headlamps into the road to dazzle Gravener's chauffeur, Harris. Fearing a collision, Harris swerves the car into a lake and both he and Gravener drown. The clinically-dead Gravener is discovered by two passing doctors and taken to Slaton Hospital, where he is revived with the aid of a stasis and recovery unit.Bentley 2001, p. 42.Bentley 2001, p. 82. The next day, a Mysteron reconstruction of Gravener travels to Slaton Airbase and commandeers an XK-107 bomber armed with a nuclear warhead. When word reaches the base of Gravener's accident, the personnel realise that the pilot is an impostor and block the runway just as he is taking off. The XK-107 crashes and explodes, killing the reconstructed Gravener. Spectrum connects the attempted theft of the XK-107 to a Mysteron threat to destroy the world capital, Futura City. Briefed by Captains Scarlet and Blue (voiced by Francis Matthews and Ed Bishop), the original Gravener leaves in a second XK-107 in an attempt to impersonate his Mysteron reconstruction. As hoped, Captain Black (voiced by Donald Gray) telepathically contacts the aircraft: he instructs Gravener to land 30 miles outside Futura City at the disused Weston Airstrip, where his truck is shown to be waiting. Scarlet deduces that the purpose of the rendezvous was to transfer the warhead to a road vehicle, after which Gravener's reconstruction was to have continued flying the XK-107 as a decoy while the warhead was driven into Futura City and detonated. Spectrum ground forces, led by Scarlet and Blue in a Spectrum Patrol Car, converge on the airstrip to capture Black. The truck attempts to escape but crashes into a bunker, killing its driver. However, Scarlet, Blue and the newly arrived Gravener are shocked to find that this man is not Black, but a Mysteron reconstruction of Harris. Although the Mysterons were unable to distinguish between the two Graveners, Black's \\"sixth sense\\" has enabled him to evade Spectrum once again. ==Production== \\"Treble Cross\\" was filmed over two weeks in September 1967, during which time Century 21's next Supermarionation series, Joe 90, entered pre-production. The scale model representing Slaton Hospital previously appeared as the microbiological laboratory in \\"Place of Angels\\". For realism, during the filming of the revival scenes the front of the Major Gravener puppet was fitted with an air bag to make it appear that the character's chest is rising and falling. Footage showing the Spectrum forces converging on Weston Airstrip is duplicated from \\"Manhunt\\", another episode in which Spectrum attempts to apprehend Captain Black. \\"Treble Cross\\" is one of several Captain Scarlet episodes written by Tony Barwick to include a mention of 10 July. Barwick liked to insert references to this date as it was his birthday.Bentley 2001, p. 78. ==Reception== Anthony Clark of sci-fi- online.com considers this episode's premise \\"more interesting\\" than that of \\"Fire at Rig 15\\" but describes \\"Treble Cross\\" overall as \\"a little slow\\". Shane M. Dallmann of Video Watchdog magazine calls it \\"less amusing but far more intelligent\\" than \\"Flight to Atlantica\\". Media historian Nicholas J. Cull believes \\"Treble Cross\\" to be one of several Captain Scarlet episodes that demonstrate writer Tony Barwick's interest in the dangers of nuclear technology. He regards the plot involving the attempted theft of a nuclear warhead as an example of Barwick re-using his \\"favourite device\\". ==References== Works cited * ==External links== * * *\\"Treble Cross\\" at TheVervoid.com Category:1968 British television episodes Category:Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons episodes Category:Television episodes about nuclear war and weapons ","title":"Treble Cross"},{"id":"9135148","text":"KWCE-LP, UHF analog channel 27, is a low-powered MeTV-affiliated television station licensed to Alexandria, Louisiana, United States.

In addition, the analog station's low-power signal contour is limited to the immediate Alexandria area.https://enterpriseefiling.fcc.gov/dataentry/public/tv/publicFacilityTechDetails.html?facilityId=40521&applicationId;=2190e677cb2f4e9fbb84cf6212b6c0ea Therefore, in order to reach the entire market, KWCE-LP is simulcast in widescreen standard definition on KLAX-TV's second digital subchannel (virtual and UHF channel 31.2) from a transmitter in the Kisatchie National Forest southwest of Dry Prong. ==History== Plans for a new TV station in Central Louisiana occurred in the early 1990s. Tiger Eye Broadcasting of Miami, Florida held the license for K36DS. In mid-2000, state representative Woody Jenkins purchased K36DS and launched it as Alexandria's first standalone UPN affiliate; prior to 2000, UPN's programming was carried on a secondary basis by KLAX-TV. The station went by the call letters \\"KCLA\\", even though the official call sign remained K36DS; this practice was similar to Jenkins' Baton Rouge station, KBTR-LP, which went by \\"WBTR\\" in order to be in line with other Baton Rouge television stations. Despite the UPN affiliation, KCLA was unable to attain cable coverage in the Central Louisiana area. On March 1, 2002, Pollack/Belz Broadcasting purchased KCLA from Woody Jenkins, and the station gained cable carriage in the region. At the time, KCLA also aired programming from America One and UATV on a secondary basis, similar to WBTR, but programming from those two networks soon disappeared after the acquisition. Pollack-Belz changed the call sign of the station to KWCE-LP in 2004. When UPN and The WB ceased operations in 2006, KWCE opted to become an affiliate of RetroTV, while The CW went to KBCA and MyNetworkTV affiliated with Fox affiliate WNTZ on a secondary basis. The station also moved to channel 27 to avoid interference with nearby Fox affiliate KARD of Monroe, which broadcasts digitally on channel 36 and whose signal reaches much of the Alexandria market. When KLAX upgraded to high definition in 2012, KWCE was moved to a subchannel of channel 31 and affiliated with Me-TV. Pollack/Belz Broadcasting agreed to sell KWCE-LP and KLAX-TV to Lost Coast Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Northwest Broadcasting, for $3.5 million on April 6, 2018. The sale was completed on August 31.Consummation Notice, CDBS Public Access, Federal Communications Commission, Retrieved 5 September 2018 In February 2019, Reuters reported that Apollo Global Management had agreed to acquire the entirety of Brian Brady's television portfolio, which it intends to merge with Cox Media Group (which Apollo is acquiring at the same time) and stations spun off from Nexstar Media Group's purchase of Tribune Broadcasting, once the purchases are approved by the FCC.\\"EXCLUSIVE-Apollo nears $3 billion deal to buy Cox TV stations -sources\\" from CNBC (February 10, 2019) In March 2019 filings with the FCC, Apollo confirmed that its newly-formed broadcasting group, Terrier Media, would acquire Northwest Broadcasting, with Brian Brady holding an unspecified minority interest in Terrier.

He rose to fame after coming in second place to Jonatan Cerrada on the first edition of the French 'Pop Idol', √Ä la Recherche de la Nouvelle Star. ==Biography== Thierry grew up in Auriol, a town in Bouches-du- Rh√¥ne. Keen on music from a young age, in 2001 he quit his studies in Psychology and tried unsuccessfully for both R√™ve d'un soir and Popstars 2. His break came in 2003 when he competed in A La Recherche De La Nouvelle Star, losing narrowly in the final round. Shortly afterwards, his first album Paradoxes, along with his first single, Les Mots Bleus, were released, Paradoxes coming 3rd in the top 50 albums of its opening week. After three years, Thierry released his second album on the 20 November 2006, titled eponymously Thierry Amiel. The album gained 16th place in the top selling albums of France, with the single C≈ìur Sacr√© peaking at 6th place in top singles. On 1 September 2007, Thierry competed in the Sopot Festival 2007 in Poland, representing France; his rivals were other music stars like: Sophie Ellis-Bextor, September, The Cloud Room and Monrose. He placed third. In 2010, Thierry was chosen to play the lead role of Adam, in the musical comedy, Adam et Eve, La Seconde Chance (Adam and Eve, the Second Chance), by Pascal Obispo.

Recently, in May, 2013, Thierry revealed that he has been quietly working on titles for his 4th album with help from composer-producer, Axelle Renoir. After an absence of 7 years, Thierry released \\"Art√©fact\\", his 4th album, to great acclaim in September 27, 2019. Thus far, the album has been very well received.

Directed by Harry Winer, with a story by Phil Klemmer, John Enbom, and Joe Voci and a teleplay by Klemmer and Enbom, the episode premiered on The CW on February 20, 2007. The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life as a college student while moonlighting as a private detective. The episode is the second of two to deal directly with the death of Hearst's basketball coach, Tom Barry (Matt McKenzie). In this installment, Veronica and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) search for Tom's missing son Josh (Jonathan Chase) while investigating a variety of alternate suspects. In addition, they continue to question Mindy O'Dell (Jaime Ray Newman) and Hank Landry (Patrick Fabian) with regards to the death of Dean Cyrus O'Dell. Meanwhile, Logan (Jason Dohring), Parker (Julie Gonzalo), Mac (Tina Majorino), and Bronson (Michael Mitchell) attend a scavenger hunt for Valentine's Day. \\"Mars, Bars\\" marks the final appearance of series Michael Muhney, the actor of Sheriff Lamb, after the death of his character. Muhney was not informed of his character's death until the filming of the episode; he was surprised and saddened at the decision. Spoilers about the scene were not leaked prior to the episode, something about which Muhney was happy. In addition, Mac was initially scheduled to be taken advantage of by a professor in this episode, but a romantic relationship with Bronson was chosen instead. The episode garnered 2.27 million viewers and positive reviews from television critics, with many praising Muhney's performance and viewing it as a return to form for the show, while some were more critical of Logan's subplot. == Plot synopsis == At the end of the previous episode, Postgame Mortem, Veronica is arrested by Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) on the suspicion that she helped the now- missing Josh Barry to escape from prison. This episode opens with Lamb questioning her and learning little, as she had nothing to do with his disappearance. Keith, Veronica's father and owner of Mars Investigations, their detective firm, visits Veronica in jail. Cliff McCormack (Daran Norris), a local public defender, also arrives, and tells Veronica that she has been all but cleared, but Sheriff Lamb will keep her in custody for as long as he can because he still believes she was involved in Josh's disappearance. Keith returns to Mars Investigations, where Hank Landry arrives and says that he found a bugging device in his phone. Landry had been implicated in the ongoing investigation into the death of Cyrus O‚ÄôDell, dean of Hearst College where Veronica is a student. Keith denies that he or Veronica placed the device in his phone, but Hank becomes angry, telling him to stop investigating him. Keith brings his findings on the death of Cyrus to Sheriff Lamb and provides an alternate explanation; that the Dean had discovered his wife was having an affair. Lamb agrees with him that it was a murder. Lamb calls Mindy O'Dell, the dean's wife and a main suspect, to his office. Logan, Veronica's on-again, off-again boyfriend, visits Veronica in her cell and they are civil to each other. After being released from jail, Veronica is stopped on the street by Josh, who has Mason (Robert Ri'chard) in the trunk of his car, frantically telling Veronica that Mason is the culprit. When Veronica disproves this claim, she tells Josh to call her using a disposable phone within 24 hours. Veronica releases Mason from the trunk. Logan takes a wireless card to Mac as a favor, and she, Parker, and Bronson invite him on a night out. Logan, Mac, Bronson, and Parker take part in a Valentine's Day scavenger hunt. The quartet find their last clue at a beach. Mac and Bronson kiss, while Parker and Logan bond while swimming. The scavenger hunt ends, and they come in third place. Logan and Parker leave, and Mac and Bronson have sex for the first time. While reviewing the O'Dell case, Veronica notices that the TV station the dean was watching the night he was murdered had moved its programming back an hour, meaning their estimated time of death was wrong. The forensic results about the prints in O'Dell‚Äôs room come back, and they are the fingerprints of Steve Botando (Richard Grieco). Steve Botando is investigated by Sheriff Lamb. Keith investigates the Coach Barry case more, finding that the Coach had Creutzfeldt‚ÄìJakob disease. His wife took out a life insurance policy several days before his death with a double indemnity clause. Keith talks to Coach Barry's wife, who pulls out a gun on him. It is a Colt .45, the gun that was used to kill Coach Barry. However, she claims that she was not intending to shoot Keith and that it is a relic of the Coach's army days. Sheriff Lamb receives a call about a robbery at the O'Dell house. It is Steve Botando, who bludgeons Lamb until he is mortally wounded. Veronica gives Josh a new ID, and he successfully unlocks his safe-deposit box at a bank. Inside is a DVD of Coach Barry telling Josh about his condition and that he was planning to have a friend kill him to avoid futile medical expenses and give his family the insurance money. Josh flees the country until he is old enough to receive the money his father left aside. Veronica shows Keith the DVD. Keith calls the Sheriff's office and finds that Sheriff Lamb has just died from his wounds. Veronica sees Logan and Parker talking. Keith, now acting Sheriff, questions Mindy with new evidence, claiming that Mindy is protecting Hank or Hank is protecting Mindy. The story continues in the next episode, Papa's Cabin. == Production  Writing and filming === \\"Mars, Bars\\" features a story by Phil Klemmer, John Enbom, and Joe Voci and a teleplay by Klemmer and Enbom, marking Klemmer's fourteenth installment of the series, Enbom's fifteenth episode for the show, and Voci's second and final writing credit (after \\"Postgame Mortem\\"). It was directed by Harry Winer, marking his fifth and final directing credit for Veronica Mars, after \\"Meet John Smith\\", \\"Blast from the Past\\", \\"Wichita Linebacker\\", and \\"Of Vice and Men\\". The scene on the beach was the work of Winer, whom Thomas referred to as a \\"visual stylist\\". He enjoyed the scene for showing Neptune as a California beach town while distinguishing itself due to the cold weather, a visual characteristic that he felt was not portrayed often enough. \\"Mars, Bars\\" features the reappearance of the character of Bronson, who had previously appeared in \\"Show Me the Monkey\\". Mac loses her virginity to Bronson in the episode. However, the writers had initially planned a storyline in which Mac would be taken advantage of by a professor due to her fragile emotional state following her romance with Beaver (Kyle Gallner). However, the storyline was removed, partially due to the fact that Thomas and the crew wanted Mac to have something positive happen to her. Prior to the filming of this episode, Thomas counseled Jason Dohring and Julie Gonzalo, who play Logan and Parker, respectively, on the two characters' interpersonal chemistry in the episode. Specifically, he did not want them to make their flirting obvious, but rather give \\"a whiff of connection\\". === Acting === This episode marks the final appearance of series regular Michael Muhney, who plays Don Lamb on the show, after his character is bludgeoned to death by Steve Botando, played by Richard Grieco. Muhney did not know about his character's death until receiving the script for the episode. This was roughly six weeks before the episode's airing and during filming. Muhney did not know the rationale for killing the character, but when he found out, he stated that \\"I felt like a piece of me was dying as well.\\" He also stated that he was also heartbroken because he had grown attached to the character over the course of three years playing him. Muhney also expressed surprise over the writing decision. Because the crew shoots scenes out of order, the last scene that Muhney filmed was the one in which Keith offers to help Lamb in investigating the break-in at the O'Dell residence. He enjoyed acting with Grieco, calling him \\"very approachable.\\" He was also pleased with the character's sendoff, stating that it was appropriate. He wished that he had more time to say farewells to each cast and crew member individually. Lamb's last words were \\"I smell bread\\"; Muhney explained that it was a reference to a minor character death on M*A*S*H. He stated that it was an in-joke among the crew and that the words had \\"no significance within the borders of Neptune.\\" However, Muhney thought of it as his character's last burst of sarcasm. The reveal of Sheriff Lamb's death was not leaked anywhere online prior to the airing of \\"Mars, Bars\\", something about which Muhney was happy. He stated that \\"the surprise was the best part\\" and that he disliked it when spoilers from other series were released early. After the episode's initial airing, Muhney reported that his inbox was flooded with emails from press members seeking interviews, stating that new messages came after the airing in each United States time zone. Some fans were upset about his death, and debate occurred online. However, Muhney also received messages of support for the character, commenting \\"it's nice to know that he will be missed.\\" With the announcement of the Veronica Mars film in 2013, Zap2it speculated that Muhney might return; however, this was later revealed not to be the case when the official casting was announced. Thomas praised Daran Norris's performance in the episode, particularly his voice in the scene in which he defends Steve Botando in front of Sheriff Lamb. Thomas noted that Norris was also a voice actor and that he was particularly well-liked on the set for his humorous performances. == Reception  Ratings === In its original broadcast, \\"Mars, Bars\\" received 2.27 million viewers, ranking 96th of 99 in the weekly rankings. This was a decrease of 100,000 viewers from the figures of the previous episode, \\"Postgame Mortem\\", which garnered 2.37 million viewers. === Reviews === The episode received generally positive reviews from television critics. Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10, indicating that it was \\"great\\". He referred to \\"Mars, Bars\\" as one of the finest episodes of season three, praising the Valentine's Day subplot, the development of the mystery of Dean O'Dell's death, and Muhney's performance. Regarding Logan, he opined that although he did not like him moping after his breakup with Veronica, this episode fixed that by including him in the Valentine's Day subplot and setting up a romantic relationship with Parker: \\"it's just a huge relief to see Logan in a different light and interacting with different people, finally.\\" He also praised Lamb's death scene as being devoid of clich√©s by not giving him an act of heroism for his dying moments. Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on his blog What's Alan Watching?, lauded the episode. He saw the episode and the previous episode as a return to form for Veronica Mars, writing, \\"it's episodes like these last two that remind me of what this show looks like when it's really cooking.\\" He also enjoyed the lack of a redemptive moment for Lamb at the end of his life as well as the comedic value of some scenes in the episode. BuddyTV wrote that \\"Mars, Bars\\" was an example of the best the series could get. The reviewer praised all of the interconnecting subplots, Jason Dohring's performance, and the episode's pacing, writing, \\"Anybody who was kvetching over the slow pace of the last few weeks of Veronica Mars got a huge payoff tonight.\\" Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, gave a mixed review. While he was positive towards Lamb's death, he criticized the subplot involving Mac, Logan, Parker, and Bronson. Regarding Lamb, he opined that it made him realize how much he had enjoyed the role; however, he thought that \\"knowing that the show is almost finished limits its impact.\\" He was positive towards Keith's role in the episode but referred to the Valentine's Day plot as out of character for the show for its happy feel. \\"It's cute. And cuteness in an episode with the shocking death of a recurring character seems out of place.\\" Television Without Pity graded the episode a \\"B\\". BuddyTV also ranked Sheriff Lamb's death 7th on its list of the seven saddest TV deaths of 2007. On a ranking of all 64 Veronica Mars episodes, Anais Bordages of BuzzFeed ranked the episode 13th. After the series was announced as being cancelled by The CW, fans collectively sent nearly 10,000 Mars bars to Dawn Ostroff, the president of the network as a reference to the show, but the attempt was futile. == References == == External links == * *\\"Mars, Bars\\" at Mars Investigations Category:2007 American television episodes Category:Veronica Mars (season 3) episodes ","title":"Mars, Bars"},{"id":"9135251","text":"Yuchi Chifan () or Yuchi Fanchi ()The Book of Zhou gives her given name as Chifan, while the History of Northern Dynasties gives her given name as Fanchi.

She initially married Yuwen Wen (ÂÆáÊñáÊ∫´) the Duke of Xiyang‚Äîa son of Emperor Xuan's cousin Yuwen Liang (ÂÆáÊñá‰∫Æ) the Duke of Qi. She was said to be exceedingly beautiful. Sometime in or before 580, on an occasion when the wives of imperial clan members were, pursuant to the customs of the time, in the palace to greet the Emperor Xuan, Emperor Xuan was so infatuated by her beauty that he forced her to drink, and then raped her after she fell drunk. In spring 580, Yuwen Liang, angry and fearful over the incident, was one of the generals commanding troops against rival Chen dynasty. As the army withdrew from the borders after having captured the territory between the Yangtze and the Huai River in winter 579, Yuwen Liang made the plan to ambush the commander of the entire operation, Wei Xiaokuan, and then seize the entire army and support an uncle of Emperor Xuan to be emperor. The plot, however, was revealed by his staff member Ru Kuan (ËåπÂØ¨) to Wei, and when Yuwen Liang attacked Wei, Wei was prepared and defeated him. Yuwen Liang was killed in battle, and Emperor Xuan, then carrying the atypical title \\"Emperor Tianyuan\\" (Â§©ÂÖÉÁöáÂ∏ù, Tianyuan Huangdi) as retired emperor, then executed Yuwen Wen. He then summoned Yuchi Chifan to the palace and made her an imperial consort with the title Zhangguifei (Èï∑Ë≤¥Â¶É). He soon further elevated her to the title of empress (of which his wife Yang Lihua and three other concubines already possessed) with the title Tianzuo Da Huanghou (Â§©Â∑¶Â§ßÁöáÂêé). Emperor Xuan died in summer 580, and Empress Yang's father Yang Jian became regent to Emperor Xuan's son Emperor Jing. Empress Yuchi became a Buddhist nun with the name of Huashou. Her grandfather Yuchi Jiong subsequently rose against Yang Jian, but was defeated and committed suicide. His sons, and some other members of the Yuchi clan (but not the entire clan) were executed, although Empress Yuchi was not harmed. Yang Jian subsequently seized the throne and established Sui dynasty (as Emperor Wen), and she died in 595, during Emperor Wen's reign. ==References== Category:Northern Zhou empresses Category:Northern Zhou Buddhists Category:Sui dynasty Buddhists Category:Chinese Buddhist nuns Category:6th-century Buddhist nuns Category:566 births Category:595 deaths ","title":"Yuchi Chifan"},{"id":"9135281","text":"Humboldt Township is one of twelve townships in Coles County, Illinois, United States.

It was released on September 1, 2001 by Atlantic Records, and includes the song \\"I Am\\", co-written with Koliyah White.Lost Change: Amazon.co.uk: Music The album was supported by the release single \\"I Am\\". ==Critical reception== Matt Conaway of Allmusic said the following about the album: \\"One of the early volumes in BBE's ambitious beat-suite series, will.i.am's Lost Change is a solid extension of the movement, cozily nestling between Jay Dee's \\"Welcome to Detroit\\", a more rhyme-orientated opus, and Pete Rock's Petestrumentals, a distinctly jazzy, instrumental-based endeavor. Though will has taken the instrumental-based series and put his own stamp on it, that stamp still contains occasional hues of Black Eyed Peas' early organic stylings - \\"Ev Rebahdee\\" featuring Planet Asia. Yet, BBE's progressive format frees him up to dabble in a menagerie of musical styles. And he's up to the challenge, as Lost Change fuses together aspects of jazz, electronica, funk, Caribbean, and trip-hop rhythms. While the straight-up rhyming tracks border on sublime \\"I Am\\" to humdrum \\"Money\\" featuring Huck Fynn, Oezlem, and Horn Dogs, it's the instrumental format where he truly flourishes. Showing a true knack for experimentation, the album leisurely darts back and forth between the reggae-scented \\"Possessions,\\" \\"Lost Change\\", which coalesces jazzy horns, with junkyard band riffing, and the hazy electronic fuzz of \\"Thai Arrive,\\" which unfolds like a Radiohead track. Similarly, \\"Lay Me Down\\" has the potential to be a break-out hit, as will's infectious snare claps and blissful horn snippets provide a cooled-out platform for Terry Dexter's soulful vocal scatting. On \\"Control Tower,\\" will inserts a vocal clip that states, \\"I'm on the brink of a great achievement.\\" A sophisticated and musically enthralling endeavor that still manages to be accessible, Lost Change does an admirable job of implementing a host of different styles, without losing the listener in the process.\\"Lost Change - will.i.am  Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards  AllMusic ==Track listing== ==References== Category:2001 debut albums Category:Will.i.am albums Category:Atlantic Records albums Category:Albums produced by will.i.am ","title":"Lost Change"},{"id":"9135393","text":"Bani Shaybah gatekeeper, c.1880 Ka'ba key at time of Sultan Barquq of Egypt The Bani Shaiba or the sons of Shaiba (Arabic: Banƒ´ Shaybah ÿ®ŸÜŸä ÿ¥Ÿäÿ®Ÿá) are an Arab tribe that hold the keys to the Kaaba. ==Overview== The members of the tribe greet visitors into the Kaaba during the cleaning ceremony and clean the interior together with the visitors.

The fallout from Jury Records resulted in the formation of Zero Records. ==History== In the late 1950s, Don Grashey met Charlie Chuck Williams (Chuck) in Thunder Bay. The pair later moved to Vancouver. With the financial help of Norm Burley (the majority owner) and Art Phillips, who would later become Mayor of Vancouver, Zero Records was formed.\\"Honky Tonk Make Believe\\", Don Grashy - Co. Joseph Mauro, \\"My Rambling Heart\\" (Washington. D.C., 1995), pp. 45 The company's intended market from the beginning was the United States. Grashey would run the business as President, the A&R; Department and the publishing company Trilite Music. Grashey would run the business as he saw fit, sign the acts he wanted to sign and record and promote them without interference from any of the other shareholders. He had check- signing privileges for the company bank account to prevent any recurrence of the fiasco of Jury Records. Williams served as vice-president. Agnes Mackie took over as general manager of the label in May 1960. Under the direction of Don Grashey, Zero Records produced and recorded singers like Loretta Lynn, Lucille Starr, Myrna Lorrie, and Buddy De Val. Regarding Loretta Lynn, it was on live TV over KTNT in Tacoma Washington that Vancouver businessman Norm Burley then and there decided to record and released a local talent featured, the housewife-turned singer named Loretta Lynn her first single on Zero Records entitled, \\"I'm a Honky Tonk Girl,\\" in February 1960, which was recorded in Los Angeles along with three other sides. The record was largely marketed by Lynn the hard way, driving in her personal vehicle and dropping in on radio stations unannounced. Unorthodox at the time, the marketing effort worked, and the record eventually achieved the position of #14 on the country singles chart. Lynn's contract and the master of the recording was shortly purchased from Zero by Decca. Distribution of Zero was managed by Sparton Records. Although a Canadian company, the records were manufactured and warehoused in the United States. When Zero records closed, Grashey and Williams founded the DMG Sound Studio. ==Artists== *Carroll Baker *Buddy De Val *Loretta Lynn *Gene Mack *Orella Meyers *Bob Regan *Brad Reynolds *Lucille Starr *Myrna Lorrie ==References== Category:Canadian independent record labels Category:Recording studios in Canada Category:Companies based in Vancouver Category:Music of Vancouver Category:Record labels established in 1959 Category:Record labels in Vancouver Category:Defunct record labels of Canada ","title":"Zero Records"},{"id":"9135457","text":"Colin Adams is the name of: *Colin Adams (executive), British TV executive *Colin Adams (mathematician) (born 1956), mathematician and author ==See also== *Adams (surname) ","title":"Colin Adams"},{"id":"9135458","text":"Lafcadio is the debut full-length album and second release by Long Island- based alternative band As Tall as Lions. ==Track listing== #\\"Break Blossom\\" #\\"96 Heartbeats\\" #\\"Silhouettes/Silhouetting\\" #\\"The Carousel\\" #\\"Acrobat\\" #\\"Why We Cry at Movies\\" #\\"If I'm Not Out Burning\\" #\\"My Glowing Morning Dreams\\" #\\"A Ghost in Drag\\" #\\"Blowing Out a Wish\\" #\\"Goodnite, Noises Everywhere\\" #\\"*Deep Sleeper == Band == *Dan Nigro - vocals, guitar, piano, Fender Rhodes piano, vibraphone *Brian Caesar - vocals, bass guitar, programming *Cliff Sarcona - vocals, drums, percussion, programming *Saen Fitzgerald - guitar, piano, Fender Rhodes piano, keyboard, percussion *Brian Fortune - guitar, piano, organ ;Additional personnel *Eric Remschneider - cello *Sean O'Keefe - programming ==References== Category:2004 debut albums Category:As Tall as Lions albums Category:Triple Crown Records albums ","title":"Lafcadio"},{"id":"9135459","text":"Nutana is a primarily residential neighbourhood located near the centre of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. It includes the business district of Broadway Avenue. It comprises a nearly even mixture of low-density, single detached dwellings and apartment-style multiple unit dwellings. As of 2009, the area is home to 6,261 residents. The neighbourhood is considered a middle to upper- income area, with an average family income of $67,657, an average dwelling value of $206,830 and a home ownership rate of 51.3%. According to MLS data, the average sale price of a home as of 2013 was $409,891. First established in 1883, Nutana was the original settlement of what now makes up the city of Saskatoon. ==History== Trounce House (1883) The first permanent settlement was established by the Temperance Colonization Society, a group of Toronto Methodists, under John Neilson Lake. The group moved into the area in 1883, a year after Lake and a scouting party had looked for a suitable colony site. The site chosen by Lake was on the suggestion of Chief Whitecap of the Dakota tribe. The land for the settlement was located in the Treaty 6 region. Saskatoon was officially settled on August 18, 1883. The name is thought to be derived from the Cree word \\"missaskwatoomina\\", referring to the saskatoon berry shrubs that grew along the riverbank. By 1884, ferry service across the river began, making Saskatoon the crossing point for the busy Regina ‚Äì Battleford Trail. It brought more commercial traffic and business, as well as more settlers to the region. The first post office was established October 1, 1884, with J. H. C. Willoughby as the first postmaster. By 1886, there were 29 homes constructed, and the community boasted a variety of professionals and tradesmen. Still, the planned temperance colony failed for several reasons: the group was not able to obtain a contiguous block of land; the river was too shallow to ferry supplies and settlers; the nearest railway was away in Moose Jaw; land routes were small, often unmarked trails; and fears of hostility from indigenous peoples during the 1885 North-West Rebellion dampened enthusiasm from potential settlers. Without a rail link and enduring years of drought from 1885 to 1890, the economy consisted of little but subsistence farming. The first agricultural fair, later to become the Saskatoon Exhibition, was held on October 13, 1886, at the \\"Louise Grounds\\" (now Nutana Collegiate's schoolyard). The exhibition was staged there until 1903, when it was moved to the City Park neighbourhood and later the city's exhibition grounds further south. The original Victoria School (1888), in its present location on the University of Saskatchewan campus The original Victoria School was built in 1888 by stonemason Alexander (Sandy) Marr as the first school house of the temperance colony. Located at the Five Corners crossing at Broadway Avenue and 12th Street, the school yard would eventually be home to three school buildings as the population grew, the last of which being the present-day √âcole Victoria School. The first Victoria School was dismantled and reassembled on a site at the University of Saskatchewan campus in 1911. The building is often referred to as the Little Stone Schoolhouse. When the Qu'Appelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan Railway reached Saskatoon in 1890 and crossed the South Saskatchewan River, a settlement on the west bank of the river (Saskatoon's future downtown) was established, saving the existing settlement from extinction. The area now had railway links to both Regina and Prince Albert; however, the commercial centre shifted across to the west side of the river. Broadway Avenue remained the commercial and social center for the east bank. By 1901, the west bank's population had reached 113 and it incorporated as the Village of Saskatoon. Stripped of its original name, the east bank settlement renamed itself \\"Nutana\\", a scrambled inversion of \\"Saskatoon\\". It incorporated as a town on October 3, 1903, as Saskatoon had done earlier that year on July 1. Traffic Bridge A heavy influx of people into the area over the next three years put a strain on the two new towns, as well as the new neighbouring village of Riversdale. Despite the advantages of amalgamating into a single settlement, Nutana's residents demanded that a traffic bridge be built to link the two sides of the river. Up to then, the only way across the river was an unreliable ferry, or a difficult and sometimes dangerous walk across the railway bridge. In 1906. the provincial government committed to building a bridge, and Nutana ratepayers came onside. A city charter was drawn up, and Nutana merged with the town Saskatoon and the village of Riversdale to become the city of Saskatoon on July 1, 1906. The following year on October 10, 1907, the promised bridge was opened and called the Traffic Bridge. In the following decades, three more traffic bridges would link Nutana to the downtown: University Bridge (1916), Broadway Bridge (1932), and the Idylwyld Bridge (1966), which replaced the original CN railway bridge. The period between 1910 and 1912 were particularly prosperous for Saskatoon, and many of Nutana's landmark buildings were built in this time. The economic boom turned to bust by 1913, just prior to World War I, but rebounded during the Roaring Twenties. The Great Depression saw another economic downturn, followed by another period of prosperity after World War II. However, by the end of the 1950s, the advent of newer subdivisions, chain stores and shopping malls drew commercial activity away from the traditional businesses in Nutana. Home construction also slowed during this period. The neighbourhood went into decline for several decades, as exemplified by the Broadway Theatre becoming an \\"adult\\" movie theatre. In the mid-1980s, Broadway merchants and community groups began to organize in an effort to turn the area's fortunes around. In 1984, the Broadway Theatre was turned into repertory movie house and live performance venue. With the establishment of the Broadway Business Improvement District in 1986, a revitalization program was launched to refurbish the streetscape and reintroduce the area's historic identity. These events spurred a period of gentrification in Nutana; today, Broadway Avenue is again an active commercial district and the Nutana area is again considered desirable. ===Historic buildings=== Marr Residence (1884) Fire Hall No. 3 (1911) Arrand Block (1912) Grace Westminster United Church (1928) Broadway Theatre (1947) * Trounce House (1883) ‚Äì The oldest structure in Saskatoon and the last of the original houses from the temperance colony founded by John Lake. It was purchased by Henry and Bessie Trounce in 1883 from John J. Conn. In 1920 the house was moved to the back of the lot and converted into a garage while at the front, the Gustin Residence was built. Designated a municipal heritage property on April 10, 1989. * Marr Residence (1884) ‚Äì Built by Sandy Marr, it is the oldest building in Saskatoon on its original site. It was one of several houses requisitioned as a field hospital to treat wounded soldiers during the North-West Rebellion. Designated a municipal heritage property on January 11, 1982. * Garrison House (1886) ‚Äì Built entirely of fieldstone by George Wesley Garrison. Between 1891 and 1894, Garrison leased rooms to the North-West Mounted Police ‚Äì presumably in this building ‚Äì thus giving rise to its nickname \\"the jail\\" and to stories of cells in the basement. It was dismantled to its stone foundation in 1918 and rebuilt in concrete and brick. * Victoria School (three buildings; 1887, 1905, 1909) ‚Äì The original stone one-room schoolhouse, built by Alexander Marr, was relocated to the University of Saskatchewan campus in 1911. It was designated a municipal heritage property on May 17, 1982. A second school, now demolished, was built in 1905. The third and final school, designed by Walter W. LaChance, was opened in 1909 and remains to the present day. * Bell House (1910) ‚Äì A luxury riverbank house designed by noted Regina architects Edgar Storey and William Van Egmond. While the building was divided into suites in 1942, it has now been returned to single family use. * Nutana Collegiate (1910) ‚Äì Originally named the Saskatoon Collegiate Institute when it opened in 1910, Nutana collegiate was the first secondary school in the city. At first, Nutana Collegiate housed university and normal school (teacher training) as well. Storey and Van Egmond designed the building in a French Renaissance style. * Fire Hall#3 (1911) ‚Äì A two- storey structure of yellow brick banded by a heavy bracketed wooden cornice, it served as a fire hall until 1956. From 1959, at the height of the Cold War, it was used by the Department of Civil Defence as a radiation proof communications centre. It is now a bar and restaurant featuring mementos from the now-demolished Capitol Theatre. Designated a municipal heritage property on February 25, 1991. * Thirteenth Street Terrace (1911) ‚Äì Classical in design and novel in its day, this two-storey row housing was an alternative to owning a single family home in boom-time Saskatoon. It was built in 1911-1912 by Henry A. Cook, liveryman, farmer, real estate salesman and owner of the Waldorf Caf√©. Designated a municipal heritage property on December 12, 2000. * Arrand Block (1912) ‚Äì Neo-Classical style apartment block built by cousins Richard and Walter Arrand, noted Saskatoon contractors. Designated a municipal heritage property on April 10, 1989. Richard Arrand is credited with inventing the first power cement mixer, but failed to patent his design. * Calder House (1912) ‚Äì A luxurious three-storey riverbank house built for Truman Frederick Calder, apparently to replicate a similar house in Toronto that his wife Adella liked. Unfortunately Mr. Calder was struck by lightning in 1914 and killed. The house changed ownership several times and was converted into apartments in 1942. It is now a bed & breakfast. * Sommerville/Petitt House (1912) ‚Äì It was designed by Frank P. Martin in 1912 and commissioned by Herman Pettit, about whom extremely little is known. A dentist, Dr. George Sommerville, bought the house in 1918. Designated a municipal heritage property on May 16, 1988. * Gustin Residence (1920) ‚Äì The home and studio of internationally renowned piano teacher Lyell Gustin. Designated a municipal heritage property on April 10, 1989. * F.P. Martin House (1926) ‚Äì Two-storey Cottage Vernacular house was built by architect, Frank P. Martin, to be his private residence, with a semi-detached unit available for rental purposes. Noted for its high-pitched roof with double shed dormers, interlocking tile and stucco cladding, and Gothic doorways. Designated a municipal heritage property on March 3, 1997. * Grace-Westminster United Church ‚Äì David Webster designed this church for the congregation of Grace United, which originated from the original Methodist church of the temperance colony. The tower was added in 1949, and the present name adopted as the result of a 1968 merger with the congregation of Westminster United. * St. Joseph's Catholic Church ‚Äì Designed to a Romanesque style by G. Verbeke. The taller of the towers was intended for bells which were never installed. * St. Joseph's School (1928) ‚Äì Designed by David Webster, this was built at the same time as the church of the same name. The high school was established in 1980 in an agreement between the provincial government, the school division and the Kitotiminawak (parent advisory) Council. The name was changed in 1989 to Joe Duquette High School, and again in 2007 to Oskayak High School. * Main Street Electrical Substation (1929) ‚Äì Built to satisfy increased demand for electricity, it was constructed of Redcliffe brick and Claybank dark brick in a mix of Modern Classical and Prairie styles. After being decommissioned in 1973, the building fell into disrepair until being rehabilitated and turned into an office building. Designated a municipal heritage property on December 4, 2000. * Davis Dairy (1930) ‚Äì Built by architects Webster and Gilbert in 1930 for the Davis Dairy Company, then situated on Main Street. It served as a dairy until the 1970s but went through several owners ‚Äì Purity Dairy, Silverwood Dairy, and finally the Dairy Pool. In 1994 the later exterior stucco was replaced by a fine brick facade in the style of the original and the interior was completely renovated. * Broadway Theatre (1947) ‚Äì This Art Deco style movie theatre was Broadway's entertainment destination during the post-World War II years. After falling into disrepute as an \\"adult\\" movie theatre, it was restored as an arthouse cinema and live performance venue during the 1980s. Designated a municipal heritage property on April 14, 1997. ==Government and politics== Nutana exists within the federal electoral district of Saskatoon‚ÄîUniversity.

Today, Broadway Avenue is home to mainly independently owned local businesses. Some businesses are located on side streets adjacent to Broadway, in particular Main Street, 10th Street and Dufferin Avenue. A few businesses within the 8th Street commercial district lie inside Nutana's southern boundary. There is also a small mini-mall with a grocery store at the corner of 12th Street and Clarence Avenue, and two small commercial developments at Victoria Avenue and Main Street. 87 home-based businesses exist in Nutana. ==Location== Nutana is located within the Core Neighbourhoods Suburban Development Area. It is bounded by 8th Street to the south, Clarence Avenue to the east, and the South Saskatchewan River to the west. Roads are laid out in a grid fashion; streets run east-west, avenues run north-south. Some roads close to the river are laid out in rough parallel to the riverbank. All three operational road bridges into the downtown core are located in or immediately adjacent to Nutana; a fourth bridge, the historic Traffic Bridge, was closed and decommissioned in the late 2000s. Until a replacement bridge is built, Broadway Avenue and its bridge is carrying additional traffic previously carried by Victoria Avenue and the Traffic Bridge. The original 1883 layout of Saskatoon/Nutana was similar to today's boundaries, except it extended south of 8th Street to a then-unnamed road allowance (now Taylor Street). ==References== ==External links== * Nutana neighbourhood profile ‚Äì 2007 * Nutana Local Area Plan * Nutana Community Association * Broadway Business Improvement District * Broadway 360 Category:Neighbourhoods in Saskatoon ","title":"Nutana, Saskatoon"},{"id":"9135462","text":"Garfield McConnell Langhorn (September 10, 1948 ‚Äì January 15, 1969) was a United States Army soldier and a recipient of America's highest military decoration‚Äîthe Medal of Honor‚Äîfor his actions in the Vietnam War. ==Biography== Born on September 10, 1948, in Cumberland, Virginia, Langhorn was living in Brooklyn, New York, when he joined the U.S. Army.

Provencio served as the program committee chair of the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms from 2008 to 2010. ==Biography== Provencio was born in Bitburg, Germany and attended Lebanon Catholic High School in Lebanon, PA. During his undergraduate career at Swarthmore College, Provencio became interested in neuroscience while studying crayfish, cockroaches, and fireflies under Jon Copeland.Scientific American May 2011. . April 20, 2011. From 1987 to 1989 he worked as a lab technician in Steve Reppert's research laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital, where he was introduced to the field of circadian biology. He graduated in 1987 from Swarthmore College with a B.A. in Biology and went on to earn his Ph.D. from the University of Virginia, a university with a strong network of circadian biologists, in 1996. During his postdoctoral training at Uniformed Services University, Provencio held assistant and associate professorships at Uniformed Services University, Department of Anatomy, Physiology, and Genetics where he still maintains an adjunct associate professorship. He is now a full Professor at the University of Virginia. ==WorkRole of melanopsin in photic responses=== In 1998, Provencio discovered melanopsin as a novel opsin in the photosensitive skin melanophores of the African clawed frog. In 2000, he showed that melanopsin is also present in mouse, rhesus macaques, and humans, where it is only present in the eye. The unique inner retinal localization of melanopsin indicated that melanopsin was not involved in image formation. Later, he demonstrated that the melanopsin pigment might be involved in entrainment of a circadian oscillator to light cycles in mammals. He found that blind mice lacking classic outer- retinal photoreceptors (rods and cones) still had eye-mediated responses to light. Mice with the melanopsin gene knocked out but with functional rods and cones were also able to entrain. However, when melanopsin was knocked out in blind mice without rods and cones, they exhibited ‚Äúcomplete loss of photoentrainment of the circadian oscillator, pupillary light responses, photic suppression of arylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferase transcript, and acute suppression of locomotor activity by light.‚Äù Provencio concluded that either melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells or outer-retinal photoreceptors (rods and cones) are sufficient to induce a response to light. However, in the absence of either rods and cones or melanopsin, melanopsin becomes necessary for photoentrainment of the circadian oscillator and for other photic responses. To further investigate the role of melanopsin in light-induced phase shifting in mammals, the Provencio lab studied the locomotor activities of melanopsin-null mice (Opn4 -/-) in response to light. The Opn4 -/- mice showed similar circadian behaviors as the normal mice: they entrained to light/dark cycles and free-ran under constant darkness in a way expected from the normal mice. Researchers in Provencio's lab thus concluded that melanopsin was not involved in the functioning of the master clock oscillation. On the other hand, Opn4-/- mice had difficulties adjusting to new phases in response to pulses of monochromatic light. The implication was that melanopsin was necessary for phase resetting but other mechanisms of light inputs might be involved in circadian entrainment as well. In 2008, the Provencio lab was able to specifically destroy melanopsin cells in the fully developed mouse retina using an immunotoxin made of an anti-melanopsin antibody conjugated to the protein saporin. This resulted in lowered responsiveness to light/dark cycles; a similar characteristic was observed in gene-knockout mutants lacking rods, cones or melanopsin. Furthermore, light-induced negative masking, mediated by rods, cones and/or melanopsin cells, was missing in the mice lacking melanopsin cells. Therefore, Provencio suggested that cells containing melanopsin might be required to transmit rod and/or cone information for certain non-image forming visual responses. ===Entrainment in blind patients=== Provencio's discovery of melanopsin and its function in photoentrainment supports earlier studies showing that some blind patients can entrain to a daily light cycle. Since retinal ganglion cells that express melanopsin have also been found in humans, these studies suggest that blind humans who still retain functional melanopsin cells are those who are able to entrain to daily light cycles. These studies also show that blind patients who cannot entrain and lack melanopsin cells have a significantly greater risk of suffering from circadian rhythm sleep disorders. While enucleation of blind patients and babies was a common practice for cosmetic or analgesic reasons, doctors now must make a more cautious decision on whether to enucleate blind patients, especially infants, because they may still have functioning photosensitive retinal ganglion cells that express melanopsin. In addition, there are now studies attempting to optimize light therapy for those with circadian rhythm sleep disorders that specifically try to stimulate melanopsin cells in blind patients. ===Recent studies=== Provencio's research team has found that in albino mice, the amount of melanopsin protein in various retinal cells varies based on the environmental light conditions. In constant light conditions, melanopsin cell number did not increase. However, when these constant-light mice were exposed to light-dark schedules, there was regain of melanopsin cell number. This study shows that bouts of darkness or the order of light and dark periods may control the normal development of the melanopsin system. In a 2006 study, Provencio explored the role of the protein RPE65 for photoentrainment. RPE65 is an important protein found in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) that is necessary for regeneration of visual chromophore in rods and cones. RPE65 knockout mice (Rpe65(-/-)) showed much weaker phase shifts when compared to rodless, coneless mice, which suggested that RPE65 might have other roles. To further define the functions of RPE65, Provencio took Rpe65(-/-) mice and also eliminated rods. The technique used for this was insertion of the rdta transgene, which selectively kills rods. They found that circadian photosensitivity returned in these mice without RPE65 protein and without rods, versus mice without RPE65 protein that still had rods. Provencio also took Rpe65(-/-) mice and crossed them with melanopsin knockout mice (Opn4(-/-)). This created double RPE and melanopsin knockout mice, which resulted in abnormal photoentrainment and diurnal behavior. From these results, Provencio concluded that RPE65 is not necessary for the function of ipRGCs. However, because of the interesting restoration of circadian photosensitivity in rodless, RPE-less mice, there seems to be a mechanism by which rods can influences ipRGCs and rods may interact. ==See also== * Melanopsin * Chronobiology * University of Virginia * Steven M.

Prosser Distinguished Professor at UC Hastings. He previously served as Chancellor & Dean, receiving unanimous and early renewal for a second term. Wu was also the first Asian American to serve in that position. In November 2015, he announced he would return to teaching.A High-Profile Law School Dean‚Äôs Sudden Departure, Above the Law, Nov 19, 2015. In 2013, the National Jurist ranked Wu as the most influential dean in legal education and the third in the nation among legal educators and advocates influencing the ongoing debate about legal education. He was the first Asian American professor to teach at Howard Law School,Frank H. Wu, Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White 316 (New York: Basic Books, 2002). as well as the first Asian American to serve as dean of Wayne State University Law School in Detroit, Michigan. At Wayne, he was the youngest law school dean in the nation at the time of his appointment (36). Wu is the author of Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White, which was immediately re-printed in hardcover. Arguing for a new paradigm of civil rights that goes beyond a black-white paradigm, while also addressing subtle forms of racial discrimination, the book has become canonical in Asian American Studies and is widely used in classes on the subject. Yellow appears in both the film Americanese, an adaptation of American Knees by Shawn Wong, and the book Secret Identities: The Asian American Superhero Anthology. Wu himself has appeared as a character in Asian America: The Movement and the Moment.Louie, Steve, and Glenn Omatsu, eds. Asian Americans: The Movement and the Moment.

Investigation Discovery. July 25, 2013. == Early life == Wu was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on August 20, 1967. Wu's parents were immigrants from Taiwan to the United States. Wu's father was an engineer at Ford Motor Company and his father lived in Detroit, Michigan. In his book Yellow and other writings, Wu recounts how his childhood experience of being the only Asian American among his classmates and the schoolyard taunting he endured as a result of his race alerted him to racial inequalities at an early age. He further describes how his attempts to assimilate and reject what was \\"Asian\\" only seemed to reinforce his marked difference to his peers. When Wu was a teenager, a Chinese American man, Vincent Chin, was killed by two white autoworkers in Highland Park, Michigan. The multiple criminal and civil cases that ensued throughout the 1980s have been recognized as birthing the Asian American victims and Asian American movement, and were marked as the 34th Michigan Legal Milestone in 2009.Hwang, Roland. \\"Killing Spawned Asian American Civil Rights Movement,\\" Michigan Bar Journal 30 (2009). It was the Vincent Chin case that inspired Wu to pursue an active role in civil rights advocacy and the law.Tom Kervin, WSU Law School's Dean Wu takes pragmatic approach, Detroit Legal News, July 30, 2007, at 1. == Education == Wu earned his bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1988 and his J.D. degree from the University of Michigan Law School in 1991.Kervin, p. 1.

In it, he criticised some of the new Chinese immigrants while nonetheless arguing that for both principled and practical reasons, Asian Americans should welcome rather than look down on them. The article caused a stir as it was shared in Chinese-language circles, and prompted mixed responses from mainland Chinese (as well as some American-born Chinese) readers, And other sources have reported findings that seem to contradict the accuracy of Wu's remarks. He later published a follow-up article addressing new Chinese immigrants, and suggested in a conciliatory tone that his intentions had been misinterpreted. == Awards == * 2004 Named among 20 \\"Giants in the Classroom\\" by Black Issues in Higher Education magazine in its 20th anniversary issue (now Diverse Issues in Higher Education) * 2004 National Asian Pacific American Bar Association's \\"Best Lawyers Under 40\\" * 2004 Crain's magazine \\"40 under 40\\" * 2005 Janet A.

For more than 40 years, he published scholarly yet accessible works that generally defend traditional Protestant beliefs and practices while seeking to remain in the mainstream of modern Protestant theological thought. His Christian Foundations series has brought him recognition as an important American theologian. He characterized himself a \\"progressive evangelical\\" or \\"ecumenical orthodox\\" criticizing the excesses of both the theological left and right. He often decried the abandonment of traditional values among liberals, but also the ugly, reactionary habits of some conservatives. His own denomination, in which he was an ordained minister, is the United Church of Christ (UCC). He was raised in the Evangelical and Reformed Church, now merged with the UCC, in which his father and both his grandfathers were also ordained ministers. The \\"E and R\\" was a representative of evangelical pietism, a movement that emphasized personal piety, a discerning, educated laity, a reliance on scripture, and an acceptance of the mystical side of Christianity. Bloesch's pietistic background and personal spiritual life lay at the heart of understanding his theology and how Christianity is to continue into the future. In his view, much of American Protestantism has entrenched itself into narrow intellectually based definitions of doctrine which omit, exclude and even prohibit the mystical element as the governing element of the faith (i.e., the action of the Holy Spirit). Much of his critique is in fact directed at his own denomination, the United Church of Christ; he worked with a conservative lobbying group, the Biblical Witness Fellowship, to protest against its more liberal theological and ethical streams. From 1957 until his retirement in 1992, he was a professor of theology at the University of Dubuque Theological Seminary in Dubuque, Iowa, where he continued as a professor emeritus. The seminary's library serves as the repository of his papers. Born on May 3, 1928, in Bremen, Indiana, he received his undergraduate degree from Elmhurst College in Elmhurst, Illinois. He earned his Bachelor of Divinity (BD) at Chicago Theological Seminary, and his PhD at the University of Chicago. He did postdoctoral work in Europe at Oxford, Basel, and T√ºbingen. He served as president of the Midwest Division of the American Theological Society. In 1997, a Festschrift was published in his honor called From East to West: Essays in Honor of Donald G. Bloesch.

He was educated at Westminster School and took a BA from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1863, and an MA in 1866. He was also admitted as a barrister of the Inner Temple on 17 October 1864, but never practised law. ==Political career== Lowther first entered Parliament in 1865, as Member of Parliament for York. His maiden speech was against the Reform Bill of 1866, the failure of which brought down the ministry of Lord Russell. He also vehemently opposed the Reform Act 1867, brought forward by Disraeli and Lord Derby, but Disraeli nonetheless appointed him Parliamentary Secretary to the Poor Law Board the same year. He was a strong voice in the opposition to Gladstone, particularly to the Irish Land Bill of 1870. With the return to power of Disraeli in 1874, he was appointed Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. In 1878, he was further advanced to become Chief Secretary for Ireland and sworn of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and of Ireland. However, he was beset with difficulties during his tenure in the secretaryship. His opposition to the Land Bill was held against him, and he treated with contempt the agitation of the Land League, which would soon break out in the Land War. He went out of office with Disraeli's government in 1880, and lost his seat at York as well. Lowther cultivated many interests outside politics, and had time to cultivate them while attempting to return to Parliament. He served on several public bodies in Yorkshire and County Durham, he began to breed racehorses in 1873, and regularly ran them at races in the north of England. However, he did not bet on them, and was highly scrupulous in his conduct, becoming a member of the Jockey Club in 1877. While Lowther was defeated at a by-election in Cumberland East in February 1881, he successfully captured North Lincolnshire in September of that year. Upon his return to the House of Commons, he became known for his arch-conservatism and protectionism. Upon the abolition of the North Lincolnshire constituency in 1885, he stood for Louth, but was defeated, and again in 1886 in Eskdale. He re-entered the house in 1888 at a by-election for the Isle of Thanet. Despite his uncompromising views, he enjoyed general popularity in the House of Commons, and had an excellent command of parliamentary procedure. However, by 1903, he had been forced to give over active Parliamentary work, and sold off his racehorses. ==Lowther estates== In 1882, Lowther's third cousin once removed, Hugh Lowther, succeeded as Earl of Lonsdale and to the Lowther estates, of which James was senior trustee. Lonsdale's habits were extravagant, and James was to have great difficulty in restraining his spending, which would ultimately ruin the estate. James himself inherited Wilton Castle upon his father's death in 1894, and took great interest in managing the estate. ==Personal life== He died at Wilton on 12 September 1904, and left the castle to his nephew Colonel John George Lowther. ==References== * == External links == * * Category:1840 births Category:1904 deaths Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Members of the Inner Temple Category:Members of the Privy Council of Ireland Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:People educated at Westminster School, London Category:UK MPs 1865‚Äì1868 Category:UK MPs 1868‚Äì1874 Category:UK MPs 1874‚Äì1880 Category:UK MPs 1880‚Äì1885 Category:UK MPs 1886‚Äì1892 Category:UK MPs 1892‚Äì1895 Category:UK MPs 1895‚Äì1900 Category:UK MPs 1900‚Äì1906 Category:Younger sons of baronets James Category:Chief Secretaries for Ireland ","title":"James Lowther (politician, born 1840)"},{"id":"9135700","text":"Large California mussel beds, north Moonstone beach near Cambria, California. Brown, furry-looking seaweed is Gloiopeltis furcata , both in the mid to upper intertidal zones. The California mussel (Mytilus californianus) is a large edible mussel, a marine bivalve mollusk in the family Mytilidae. This species is native to the west coast of North America, occurring from northern Mexico to the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. California mussels are found clustered together, often in very large aggregations, on rocks in the upper intertidal zone on the open coast, where they are exposed to the strong action of the surf. ==Shell description== The shell of this species is thick and is often 129 to 130 mm in length, sometimes larger still. The shell is blue on the outside with a heavy brown periostracum which is usually worn off except near the growing edge of the shell. The beaks of the shell are often eroded. The shell has coarse radial ribbing and irregular growth lines on the outer surface. The inner surface of the shell is blue and faintly pearly. Like other mytilids, the animal is attached to the substrate with a very strong and elastic byssus. == Ecology == The California mussel prefers the high salinity, low sediment conditions found on open rocky coasts. However, they do not colonize bare rock easily, instead preferring the shelter of pre-existing mussels and their biological filaments. Mussels attach themselves to the hard surfaces using their thread-like byssus. Given the right circumstances, California mussels can grow up to 200 mm (8 inches) in length and may live for more than 20 years. However, mortality in intertidal open coastal environments is often high, resulting from battering from driftwood and other debris, wave pounding, predation, desiccation, and disease. Predators of California mussels include the Pisaster starfish. They feed on plankton. == Human use == California mussels were an important food source for the Native Americans who lived on the Pacific Coast prior to European contact. On California's Northern Channel Islands, archaeological evidence shows that they were harvested continuously for almost 12,000 years. Erlandson et al. (2008) documented a decline in the average size of harvested California mussels on San Miguel Island during the past 10,000 years, a pattern they attributed to growing human populations and increased predation pressure from human fishing. Hogan (2008) notes more specific archaeological recovery from the Chumash in the period 800 to 1300 AD. California mussels continue to be harvested as sources of both food and bait up and down the Pacific Coast of North America. The flesh of the California mussel tends to be orange in color. They can be baked, boiled, or fried like other mussels, clams, and oysters. While these mussels are usually edible, care needs to be taken, because during times of red tide in any given locality, California mussels may contain harmful levels of the toxins which can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning. ==In science== The keystone species concept was coined, in 1969, by the zoologist Robert T. Paine, professor emeritus of the University of Washington, to explain the relationship between Pisaster ochraceus, a species of starfish, and Mytilus californianus. == See also == * Blue mussel, Mytilus edulis == References  Notes = Sources === * Erlandson, Jon M., T.

She joined the RAAF in 1981, and became one of its first female pilots in the early 1990s. Corbould flew transport aircraft, including during the Iraq War in 2003, and commanded No. 36 Squadron from 2006 to 2008. She retired from the RAAF in 2011, but remains an officer in the Air Force Reserve. ==Career== Linda Corbould was raised in Tasmania, Australia and joined the RAAF in 1981. At this time she wanted to become a pilot, but women were barred from this role. In a 2018 interview, Corbuld said that the recruitment officers \\"pretty much laughed at me\\" when she told them about her ambition. Instead, she served as an air traffic controller until 1990 when pilot training was opened up to women. During this period she took up skydiving, and became a national champion in the sport. In 1985 she represented Australia at the skydiving world championships which were held in Turkey. After completing flight training, Corbould became the third female member of the RAAF to gain her 'wings' and was subsequently posted to No 36 Squadron and flew C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. Corbould served as deputy commander of the C-130 Hercules detachment which formed part of the Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for planning and commanding a flight into Baghdad on the night of 12/13 April 2003. In October 2003 she met United States President George W. Bush during his visit to Australia. Corbould eventually amassed 15 years of experience as a C-130 pilot. She completed a Diploma of Military Studies at the Australian Command and Staff College during 2005. In 2006, Wing Commander Corbould oversaw the RAAF's program to accept the C-17 Globemaster III strategic transport aircraft into service. She assumed command of No. 36 Squadron RAAF on 17 November 2006 and delivered the RAAF's first C-17 from the United States to Australia on 4 December 2006. Corbould completed her posting as commander of the squadron on 8 December 2008. On this day she also led the RAAF's first all-female aircrew during a training flight. The next woman to lead a RAAF flying squadron assumed command of No. 33 Squadron in December 2018, and No. 36 Squadron did not have another all-female aircrew until August 2020. After completing her posting to No. 36 Squadron, Corbould was appointed the Senior Air Force Officer in Tasmania, a position she had requested. She retired from the RAAF on 8 May 2011 after completing 30 years of service, but remained an officer in the Air Force Reserve. In this role she works with Australian Air Force Cadets. In July 2015 Corbould was the keynote speaker at a RAAF Association reunion in Launceston. In November that year she was appointed a member of the Veterans' Review Board, which is an independent statutory authority that assesses decisions made by several Australian Government agencies concerning grants and pensions for ex-service personnel. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Royal Australian Air Force officers Category:Recipients of the Medal of the Order of Australia Category:Women in the Iraq War Category:Australian aviators Category:Women air force personnel Category:Women in the Australian military Category:People from Tasmania Category:Australian female aviators Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Linda Corbould"},{"id":"9135915","text":" The Bristol Biplane Type 'T', sometimes called the Challenger-Dickson Biplane, was a derivative of the Bristol Boxkite. It was built in 1911 by the British and Colonial Aeroplane Company and was designed as a cross-country racing aircraft for Maurice Tabuteau. ==Development== The Type 'T' was not a development of the Bristol Boxkite but did use some of the experience gained with the Boxkite. It was designed by George Challenger, with the assistance of practical advice from Captain Bertram Dickson, a prominent pilot of the day. It had the same \\"Farman\\" configuration as the Boxkite, differing principally in having an enclosed nacelle to house the pilot. The structure bearing the front elevator also differed substantially: the elevator was mounted lower down, level with the lower wing, and the undercarriage skids were continued forward and upwards to form part of the elevator mounting. The rear-mounted twin rudders were balanced, unlike those of the Boxkite. The first aircraft (Bristol No. 45) was built to compete in the 1911 Circuit de l'Europe race, with Maurice Tabuteau as pilot, and was powered by a Gnome Gamma rotary engine. Tabateau put up a creditable performance, and completed all of the race's nine stages. Four more aircraft were built for 1911 Daily Mail Circuit of Britain Air Race. These differed from the design of No. 45 in having a modified nacelle and rudders placed further out, away from the slipstream of the engine. *No. 51 was to be flown by Graham Gilmour in the race but he was unable to compete because his licence had been suspended. After the race the aircraft was fitted with a 50 hp Gnome and sold to Gerald Napier but on 2 August 1911 it crashed at Brooklands, killing Napier. *No. 52 had a 70 hp Gnome engine and was flown by Collyns Pizey. *No. 53 had a 70 hp Gnome engine and was flown by Gordon England, and was withdrawn with engine problems. *No. 54 had a 60 hp Renault engine and was to be flown by Howard Pixton, who crashed during the race and did not finish. Maurice Tabuteau also entered the race in the original Type T No. 45 but none of Type Ts finished the race. After the crash of No. 51 none of the Type Ts were flown again. An additional machine, No. 59, was modified by Gordon England as the Challenger-England biplane. One more aircraft, No. 78, was to be fitted with a 100 hp Gnome engine but was never completed. ==The Challenger-England biplane== Under the direction of Gordon England one aircraft was later converted to a tractor configuration, powered by a E.N.V.

(also known as Toy Story Mania!) is an interactive 4-D theme park attraction, located at three Disney theme parks: Disney's Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida, Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort and Tokyo DisneySea at Tokyo Disney Resort. Designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and inspired by Disney¬∑Pixar's Toy Story franchise, the attraction was first unveiled during a press conference at Walt Disney World in January 2007. The Florida version opened officially on May 31, 2008, on the same date that the Buzz Lightyear action figure launched onboard Space Shuttle flight STS-124 (whose objective was to deliver the largest module of the space station - the Japanese Experiment Module pressurized section.), while the California version officially opened on June 17, 2008. The Japan version of the attraction opened on July 9, 2012. ==Concept== Park guests wear 3-D glasses (Carnival Games Goggles) aboard spinning vehicles that travel through virtual environments based on classic carnival midway games. Ride vehicles seat up to eight in four back-to-back pairs. Small children are also able to ride on an adult's lap if they are facing forward with their legs securely underneath the safety bar. ===Mini-games=== The attraction features five mini-games after a practice round, each of which includes at least one \\"Easter egg\\" that can trigger additional targets or gameplay changes. In order, the games are: # Pie Throw Practice Booth (pie toss target practice game, a no points introduction) # Hamm & Eggs (egg throw game featuring Hamm and Buttercup from Toy Story 3) # Rex and Trixie's Dino Darts (dart throw game; replaced Bo Peep's Baa-loon Pop) # Green Army Men Shoot Camp (baseball throw / plate breaking game) # Buzz Lightyear's Flying Tossers (ring toss game) # Woody's Rootin' Tootin' Shootin' Gallery (suction cup shooting game) Each guest's score is recorded by an onboard display screen as points are acquired with individual toy cannons firing simulated projectiles at virtual targets. Toy Story characters including Woody, Hamm, Buzz Lightyear, Rex, Trixie and many more characters appear during the attraction's different games. Similar technology had been used in Disney attractions such as Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for Buccaneer Gold at DisneyQuest and several Buzz Lightyear attractions. According to Disney, it is the first attraction created simultaneously by Walt Disney Imagineering for two theme parks. The line at both parks features a large Mr. Potato Head Audio-Animatronics figure that interacts with guests through pre-recorded snippets of dialogue performed by comedian Don Rickles, who voiced the character in the Toy Story films. The sophisticated figure identifies people in the audience, sings and tells jokes. ===Former mini- games=== Only five mini-games can be used at a time. So far, only one game has left the attraction. On May 21, 2010, the original dart throwing game, Bo Peep's Baaa-loon Pop, was replaced with \\"Rex and Trixie's Dino Darts\\" (updated with the release of Toy Story 3). ==Timeline== *January 2007: Toy Story Midway Mania is announced at a press conference for Disney's Hollywood Studios.

It marks the company's first use of industrial ethernet for a ride's control system. Many of the parts for the attraction's control system came from two of Disney's corporate sponsors from Disney's second park Epcot, Siemens AG (from Spaceship Earth) and Hewlett-Packard (from Mission: Space) The ride is the biggest system that has been built, and runs on one of Disney's most advanced automation systems to date. The control system is divided into three components: one for the ride vehicles, one for the games and one more for the attraction's special effects. Programmable logic controllers in the vehicles alert the control system wirelessly via ProfiNET RT to the vehicle's speed and location. The central controller then sends its instructions back to the vehicles using a hard-wired network within the track. The one-way communications flow adds a factor of safety, even though the wireless network is protected against outside interference, such as a denial-of-service attack. The attraction features more than 150 PCs, which includes one HP Windows XP PC for each of Midway Mania's 56 game screens, as well as others that control the special effects at each game. At the game screens, two tracking systems provide the game control system with the vehicle's exact location, making sure that gameplay is not affected by even minor differences in vehicle position. According to Jody Gerstner, executive director of show and ride controls, \\"The game doesn‚Äôt care if the car parks in the same spot every time. It just needs to know where each car has actually parked, and it can compensate.\\" Additional sensors in the spring-action shooter provide information on its orientation, which is fine-tuned using data on the position of the ride vehicle at the screen and the rotation of the seats on the vehicle base. All three sub- systems work together to handle any contingency. For example, if a delay or other vehicle stoppage is detected (such as might occur if the loading and unloading of the ride vehicles is taking longer than expected), the control system can command the affected game screens to launch a non-scoring practice round, so that guests may continue to shoot targets while they wait. Similarly, it can instruct the show control system to play an audio spiel telling guests about the delay. As the games are software-based, changes can be made to the attraction's lineup of games without significant effort. In April 2010, Disney Parks announced plans to replace Bo Peep's Baaa-loon Pop with Rex and Trixie's Dino Darts. The change took place on May 21, 2010. The new game includes one of the new characters from the Toy Story 3 feature film, which was released in June 2010. ==Locations== Toy Story Midway Mania at Disney California Adventure in 2009 * Disney California Adventure: Pixar Pier, beneath the Incredicoaster roller coaster, a space formerly occupied by themed midway games and food service locations. The area is designed to resemble a Victorian-era seaside carnival. Pixar Pier replaced Paradise Pier on June 23, 2018, and the attraction located in California is the main attraction of a \\"Toy Story\\" themed area in the new land. * Disney's Hollywood Studios: Toy Story Land, inside the studios' former soundstages, which were most recently used for the park's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ‚Äì Play It! attraction. The original facade, as well as the original surrounding area, resembles Pixar Animation Studios' campus in Emeryville, California. The attraction's entrance was relocated to Toy Story Land on June 30, 2018, with the Pixar Place area closing. * Tokyo DisneySea: Located in the New York area of the American Waterfront in a new area called Toyville Trolley Park. ==Operational changes== In October 2014, Disney's Hollywood Studios began testing a new procedure that would require all riders to have FastPass reservations for the attraction. The test, scheduled to last only a few days, eliminated the standby line that is used by visitors who have not already obtained a FastPass ticket for the ride, either because they had all been claimed or they were holding FastPasses for other attractions. Some analysts suggest that this process could become more common in years to come as amusement parks attempt to keep guests from getting frustrated or waiting in extremely long lines. ==Name variation== The attraction is being referred to as both Toy Story Midway Mania! and Toy Story Mania!. While the attraction marquees and some in-park signage read the former, the latter has been used in press releases to the news media, used in both resorts' advertisements, and on the disneyland.com, disneyworld.com, and official promotional website for the attraction, along with attraction merchandise. Websites for both Disneyland and Walt Disney World both identified the attraction with the registered trademark \\"Toy Story Midway Mania!\\" as of September 2014. As of February 2019, the attraction is known as \\"Toy Story Mania!\\", except for the Disney California Adventure version which is still known as ‚ÄúToy Story Midway Mania!‚Äù == Music == Music for the queue area was arranged and recorded by Jennifer Hammond at Capitol Studios with a live orchestra. More than an hour of music was recorded, all based on the first two Toy Story scores composed by Randy Newman. == Merchandising == Disney Interactive Studios released a \\"Toy Story Mania!\\" video game in September 2009 exclusively for the Nintendo Wii console. The game features gameplay and levels similar to those in the theme park attractions, along with original levels and features. Jakks Pacific also released their \\"Plug It In & Play TV Game\\" version of \\"Toy Story Mania!\\" in 2010 featuring the original levels & Infini-D technology (Infini-D glasses are included). A version for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 was released on October 30, 2012 Developed by High Voltage Software. ==See also== * 2012 in amusement parks * List of Disney California Adventure attractions * List of Disney's Hollywood Studios attractions *Toy Story Land *Buzz Lightyear attractions == References == ==External links== * Disney California Adventure - Toy Story Midway Mania! * Disney's Hollywood Studios - Toy Story Mania! * Tokyo DisneySea - Toy Story Mania!

Every time a customer purchased fuel at an Esso fuel station in Canada, they received a small packet of \\"6 - Power Players Trader's Stickers\\". These were then pasted into an album. Two albums were available, the standard (paperback) issue and a deluxe (hardcover) edition. The front cover of the softcover album read in French: \\"NHL Les Grands Du Hockey Album\\" and in English: \\"NHL Power Player Saver\\". == Overview == In the French edition, the first team listed was Montreal Canadiens; in the English version, the first team was Toronto Maple Leafs. An obvious attempt at regional marketing. Each team had space for 18 player cards, which were about half the size of a hockey card, cut horizontally. Hard cover sets retail for approximately $250, while soft cover sets are approximately $100. Along with the cards, collectors got a plastic wallet which folded in half and when opened, had four slots for storing cards. At some time later in the season, ESSO issued additional stickers for players traded during the season. At the end of the season, it was possible to write to Esso to order any cards one did not have. When one received the cards, they also came with 252 additional stickers to go below the cards in the album. These additional stickers showed the games, goals, assists, points, and penalty minutes for each player. ==References== Category:Ice hockey collectibles Category:Trading cards Category:ExxonMobil Category:Advertising campaigns Category:1970s in Canada Category:1970s in North American sport ","title":"Esso Power Players"},{"id":"9136046","text":"Frederick Osam-Duodu (4 June 1938 ‚Äì 4 October 2016) was a Ghanaian coach and a FIFA Instructor.

In mathematics, the axis‚Äìangle representation of a rotation parameterizes a rotation in a three-dimensional Euclidean space by two quantities: a unit vector indicating the direction of an axis of rotation, and an angle describing the magnitude of the rotation about the axis. Only two numbers, not three, are needed to define the direction of a unit vector rooted at the origin because the magnitude of is constrained. For example, the elevation and azimuth angles of suffice to locate it in any particular Cartesian coordinate frame. By Rodrigues' rotation formula, the angle and axis determine a transformation that rotates three-dimensional vectors. The rotation occurs in the sense prescribed by the right-hand rule. The rotation axis is sometimes called the Euler axis. It is one of many rotation formalisms in three dimensions. The axis‚Äìangle representation is predicated on Euler's rotation theorem, which dictates that any rotation or sequence of rotations of a rigid body in a three-dimensional space is equivalent to a pure rotation about a single fixed axis. ==Rotation vector== The axis‚Äìangle representation is equivalent to the more concise rotation vector, also called the Euler vector. In this case, both the rotation axis and the angle are represented by a vector codirectional with the rotation axis whose length is the rotation angle , :\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta} = \\\\theta \\\\mathbf{e} \\\\,. It is used for the exponential and logarithm maps involving this representation. Many rotation vectors correspond to the same rotation. In particular, a rotation vector of length , for any integer , encodes exactly the same rotation as a rotation vector of length . Thus, there are at least a countable infinity of rotation vectors corresponding to any rotation. Furthermore, all rotations by are the same as no rotation at all, so, for a given integer , all rotation vectors of length , in all directions, constitute a two-parameter uncountable infinity of rotation vectors encoding the same rotation as the zero vector. These facts must be taken into account when inverting the exponential map, that is, when finding a rotation vector that corresponds to a given rotation matrix. The exponential map is onto but not one-to-one. ===Example=== Say you are standing on the ground and you pick the direction of gravity to be the negative direction. Then if you turn to your left, you will rotate radians (or 90¬∞) about the axis. Viewing the axis-angle representation as an ordered pair, this would be :( \\\\mathrm{axis}, \\\\mathrm{angle} ) = \\\\left( \\\\begin{bmatrix} e_x \\\\\\\\\\\\ e_y \\\\\\\\\\\\ e_z \\\\end{bmatrix},\\\\theta \\\\right) = \\\\left( \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{bmatrix},\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}\\\\right). The above example can be represented as a rotation vector with a magnitude of pointing in the direction, : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\end{bmatrix}. == Uses == The axis‚Äìangle representation is convenient when dealing with rigid body dynamics. It is useful to both characterize rotations, and also for converting between different representations of rigid body motion, such as homogeneous transformations and twists. When a rigid body rotates around a fixed axis, its axis‚Äìangle data are a constant rotation axis and the rotation angle continuously dependent on time. Plugging the three eigenvalues 1 and and their associated three orthogonal axes in a Cartesian representation into Mercer's theorem is a convenient construction of the Cartesian representation of the Rotation Matrix in three dimensions. == Rotating a vector == Rodrigues' rotation formula, named after Olinde Rodrigues, is an efficient algorithm for rotating a Euclidean vector, given a rotation axis and an angle of rotation. In other words, Rodrigues' formula provides an algorithm to compute the exponential map from to without computing the full matrix exponential. If is a vector in and is a unit vector rooted at the origin describing an axis of rotation about which is rotated by an angle , Rodrigues' rotation formula to obtain the rotated vector is : \\\\mathbf{v}_\\\\mathrm{rot} = (\\\\cos\\\\theta) \\\\mathbf{v} + (\\\\sin\\\\theta) (\\\\mathbf{e} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{v}) \\\\+ (1 - \\\\cos\\\\theta) (\\\\mathbf{e} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v}) \\\\mathbf{e} \\\\,. For the rotation of a single vector it may be more efficient than converting and into a rotation matrix to rotate the vector. == Relationship to other representations == There are several ways to represent a rotation. It is useful to understand how different representations relate to one another, and how to convert between them. Here the unit vector is denoted instead of . === Exponential map from \\\\mathfrak{so}(3) to SO(3) === The exponential map effects a transformation from the axis-angle representation of rotations to rotation matrices, :\\\\exp\\\\colon \\\\mathfrak{so}(3) \\\\to \\\\mathrm{SO}(3) \\\\,. Essentially, by using a Taylor expansion one derives a closed-form relation between these two representations. Given a unit vector representing the unit rotation axis, and an angle, , an equivalent rotation matrix is given as follows, where is the cross product matrix of , that is, for all vectors , :R = \\\\exp(\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{K}) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{(\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{K})^k}{k!} = I + \\\\theta \\\\mathbf{K} + \\\\frac{1}{2!}(\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{K})^2 + \\\\frac{1}{3!}(\\\\theta \\\\mathbf{K})^3 + \\\\cdots Because is skew-symmetric, and the sum of the squares of its above-diagonal entries is 1, the characteristic polynomial of is . Since, by the Cayley‚ÄìHamilton theorem, = 0, this implies that :\\\\mathbf{K}^3 = -\\\\mathbf{K} \\\\,. As a result, , , , . This cyclic pattern continues indefinitely, and so all higher powers of can be expressed in terms of and . Thus, from the above equation, it follows that :R = I + \\\\left(\\\\theta - \\\\frac{\\\\theta^3}{3!} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta^5}{5!} - \\\\cdots\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{K} + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta^2}{2!} - \\\\frac{\\\\theta^4}{4!} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta^6}{6!} - \\\\cdots\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{K}^2 \\\\,, that is, :R = I + (\\\\sin\\\\theta) \\\\mathbf{K} + (1-\\\\cos\\\\theta) \\\\mathbf{K}^2\\\\ , by the Taylor series formula for trigonometric functions. This is a Lie-algebraic derivation, in contrast to the geometric one in the article Rodrigues' rotation formula.This holds for the triplet representation of the rotation group, i.e., spin 1. For higher dimensional representations/spins, see Due to the existence of the above-mentioned exponential map, the unit vector representing the rotation axis, and the angle are sometimes called the exponential coordinates of the rotation matrix . === Log map from SO(3) to \\\\mathfrak{so}(3) === Let continue to denote the 3 √ó 3 matrix that effects the cross product with the rotation axis : for all vectors in what follows. To retrieve the axis‚Äìangle representation of a rotation matrix, calculate the angle of rotation from the trace of the rotation matrix : \\\\theta = \\\\arccos\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{Tr}(R) - 1}{2} \\\\right) and then use that to find the normalized axis, : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\sin \\\\theta} \\\\begin{bmatrix} R_{32}-R_{23} \\\\\\\\\\\\ R_{13}-R_{31} \\\\\\\\\\\\ R_{21}-R_{12} \\\\end{bmatrix} ~, where R_{ij} is the component of the rotation matrix, R, in the i-th row and j-th column. Note that the axis-angle representation is not unique since a rotation of -\\\\theta about -k is the same as a rotation of \\\\theta about k. The Matrix logarithm of the rotation matrix is : \\\\log R = \\\\begin{cases} 0 & \\\\text{if } \\\\theta = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dfrac{\\\\theta}{2 \\\\sin \\\\theta } \\\\left(R - R^\\\\mathsf{T}\\\\right) & \\\\text{if } \\\\theta e 0 \\\\text{ and } \\\\theta \\\\in (-\\\\pi, \\\\pi) \\\\end{cases} An exception occurs when has eigenvalues equal to . In this case, the log is not unique. However, even in the case where Œ∏ = the Frobenius norm of the log is : \\\\ \\\\log(R) \\\\_\\\\mathrm{F} = \\\\sqrt{2}  \\\\theta  \\\\,. Given rotation matrices and , : d_g(A,B) := \\\\left\\\\ \\\\log\\\\left(A^\\\\mathsf{T} B\\\\right)\\\\right\\\\_\\\\mathrm{F} is the geodesic distance on the 3D manifold of rotation matrices. For small rotations, the above computation of may be numerically imprecise as the derivative of arccos goes to infinity as . In that case, the off-axis terms will actually provide better information about since, for small angles, . (This is because these are the first two terms of the Taylor series for .) This formulation also has numerical problems at , where the off-axis terms do not give information about the rotation axis (which is still defined up to a sign ambiguity). In that case, we must reconsider the above formula. :R = I + \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\sin\\\\theta + \\\\mathbf{K}^2 (1-\\\\cos\\\\theta) At , we have :R = I + 2 \\\\mathbf{K}^2 = I + 2(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} \\\\otimes \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} - I) = 2 \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} \\\\otimes \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} - I and so let :B:=\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} \\\\otimes \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} = \\\\frac{1}{2}(R+I) \\\\,, so the diagonal terms of are the squares of the elements of and the signs (up to sign ambiguity) can be determined from the signs of the off-axis terms of . === Unit quaternions === the following expression transforms axis‚Äìangle coordinates to versors (unit quaternions): :Q = \\\\left(\\\\cos\\\\tfrac{\\\\theta}{2}, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} \\\\sin\\\\tfrac{\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right) Given a versor represented with its scalar and vector , the axis‚Äìangle coordinates can be extracted using the following: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\theta &= 2\\\\arccos s \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8px] \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} &= \\\\begin{cases} \\\\dfrac{\\\\mathbf{x}}{ \\\\sin \\\\tfrac{\\\\theta}{2} }, & \\\\text{if } \\\\theta eq 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & \\\\text{otherwise}. \\\\end{cases}\\\\end{align} A more numerically stable expression of the rotation angle uses the atan2 function: :\\\\theta = 2 \\\\operatorname{atan2}(\\\\mathbf{x},s)\\\\,, where is the Euclidean norm of the 3-vector . == See also == * Homogeneous coordinates * Screw theory, a representation of rigid body motions and velocities using the concepts of twists, screws and wrenches * Pseudovector == References == Category:Rotation in three dimensions Category:Angle ","title":"Axis‚Äìangle representation"},{"id":"9136087","text":"Paradise Township is one of twelve townships in Coles County, Illinois, USA.

SR 15 runs over from Stonington in the south to Jackman in the north. ==Route description== SR 15 begins in the town of Stonington, at the intersection of Main Street, School Street, and West Main Street. The route proceeds north out of Stonington and through Deer Isle en route to the mainland of Maine. Upon leaving the islands to the south via the Deer Isle Bridge, SR 15 meets SR 175 and forms an approximately concurrency with it. SR 15 then splits off 175 and then joins SR 176 farther to the north. The two routes continue into Blue Hill, where SR 15 turns northward, while 176 goes to the east. Continuing north, Route 15 meets SR 199 in North Penobscot. Upon reaching Orland, SR 15 meets U.S. Route 1 (US 1) and SR 3, and joins the concurrency northbound. The road sees the ends of Routes 166 and 46 before reaching the town of Bucksport. Upon reaching the town, US 1 and SR 3 split off and SR 15 turns northward towards Bangor. SR 15 continues towards Bangor, straddling the east side of the Penobscot River, along with US-1 to the west. SR 15 enters Brewer and follows South Main Street to an interchange with Interstate 395 (I-395) at exit 4. SR 15 joins I-395 westbound and runs concurrent with the Interstate (also with US 202 between exits 3 and 2) to its terminus, where SR 15 then takes exit 1B to join I-95 northbound for approximately . SR 15 leaves I-95 via exit 185 and joins Broadway heading north out of the city. SR 15 meets SR 221 at Six Mile Falls before entering Corinth. The route intersects with SR 11 and SR 43 in Dover-Foxcroft, forming a concurrency with SR 11\\\\. SR 15 continues to the northwest, intersecting with SR 6 and SR 16, forming a lengthy concurrency. The three routes proceed due west through Guilford, intersecting SR 23 and SR 150, and then turning to the north in Abbot Village, where SR 16 splits off to the west. Routes 6 and 15 remain concurrent for the better part of about , traveling north to Moosehead Lake, and turning west to the small town of Jackman. Routes 6 and 15 finally come to an intersection with US 201, approximately from the Canadian border. SR 15 ends at this intersection, while SR 6 joins US 201 en route to the Canadian border. ===Local names=== Within the towns connected by State Route 15, the highway also is known by various local names: * Bangor, Maine: Broadway * Brewer, Maine: South Main Street * Orrington, Maine: River Road * Bucksport, Maine: Main Street * Monson, Maine: Main Street ==History== When originally designated in 1926, SR 15 ran between Ellsworth and Greenville Junction. Between 1933 and 1934, it was extended north to Rockwood, and again, in 1940, to its current terminus in Jackman. In 1946, the route was truncated to Blue Hill, but, in 1963, it was extended south to its current terminus in Stonington. In 2004, SR 15 in Bangor was removed from downtown and routed along I-395 and I-95. The old alignment through downtown became SR 15 Business (see below). ==Major intersections== ==Auxiliary route== State Route 15 Business (abbreviated SR 15 Bus. or SR 15B) is a business route of SR 15. Its southern terminus is at I-395 and SR 15 in Brewer. Its northern terminus is at I-95 and SR 15 in Bangor. SR 15 Business was designated in 2004 after SR 15 was removed from its surface alignment in downtown Bangor and Brewer, instead being routed along I-395 and I-95 to bypass the downtown areas. ;Junction list ==References== 015 Category:Transportation in Piscataquis County, Maine Category:Transportation in Hancock County, Maine Category:Transportation in Penobscot County, Maine Category:Transportation in Somerset County, Maine ","title":"Maine State Route 15"},{"id":"9136124","text":"Steve Lacey is a Southern Gospel singer from North Alabama (Sand Mountain region).

Morris was born at Madras, India, fourteenth child of John Carnac Morris, accountant-general of the British East India Company at Madras, and his wife Rosanna Curtis. Morris was educated at Rugby School and Lincoln College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1866, with final honours in classics, law and modern history and M.A. 1869. He was an assistant master at St Peter's College, Radley, and at Haileybury, and in 1871 became headmaster of the Bedfordshire middle class public school. From 1875 to 1883 he was headmaster of the Melbourne Church of England grammar school which made progress under his direction. During his period he established the prefect system in 1876, and started the first school journal and the first school library in Melbourne. Morris resigned from Melbourne Grammar in March 1882 after financial difficulties hit the school; pupil numbers were in decline, partly due to the economic environment and partly to Morris's disciplinary measures. In November 1882 Morris was appointed Hughes professor of English at the University of Adelaide. In 1883 Morris accepted an offer from the University of Melbourne for the position of professor of modern languages and literatures. Morris introduced courses in English, French and German languages and literature. Morris took a prominent part in the management of the university; for several years he was president of the professorial board, and he was also in 1876 elected to the council of Trinity College.The Age, 10 Oct. 1876, p. 5. He had also many outside interests and it was at his suggestion that a branch of the Charity Organization Society, of which he was the first president, was founded in Melbourne in 1887.\\"Charity Organisation Conference: A Society Formed,\\" The Argus [Melbourne], 13 May 1887, p. 10. The Melbourne Shakespeare Society, for many years the most flourishing literary society in Victoria, was also founded on his suggestion and was its inaugural president 1884‚Äì1888. Morris took the greatest interest in the Melbourne public library of which he was appointed a trustee in 1879. He became vice-president of the trustees in 1896. His \\"Memoirs of George Higinbotham\\" was published in 1895, and his most important work, his painstaking and valuable Austral English: A Dictionary Of Australasian Words, Phrases And Usages was published in 1898. For this, he was awarded a Litt. D. degree by the University of Melbourne.

Giovanni Battista Zelotti (; 1526 - 28th August 1578) was an Italian painter of the late Renaissance, active in Venice and her mainland territories. He appears to have been born in Verona, then part of the Venetian mainland, and trained with Antonio Badile and Domenico Riccio, as well as perhaps Titian. Bernasconi claims he trained with his uncle Paolo Farinati. He is called Battista da Verona by Vasari, and was also known as Battista Farinati. He was a contemporary of Paolo Veronese and shared work in the Villa Soranza near Castelfranco (1551) and at Venice: the ceiling of the Sala del Consiglio dei Dieci in the Doge's Palace (1553-4); the Biblioteca Marciana (1556-7), and the Palazzo Trevisan (1557) on Murano. Zelotti came to embody the Veronese tradition on the mainland. He frescoed villas designed by Andrea Palladio, notably Villa Emo and Villa Foscari, where he worked with Bernardino India and Battista Franco: the exact number of Palladian villas he frescoed is not known. With the painter Giovanni Antonio Fasolo he worked also at Villa Caldogno (about 1570) and at Palazzo Porto Colleoni Thiene. In the 1570s he decorated the Castello del Catajo of the Obizzi family at Battaglia Terme with 40 frescoes.Recently the frescoes at Castello del Catajo have been open to the public (see Out of the Shadows, a Camelot of Italian Knights and Daring Deeds, New York Times, March 13, 2008, Arts section article, by Elisabetta Povoledo).

Though the term is not formally defined, its basic principles are generally understood to include separation of functionality (the \\"behavior layer\\") from a Web page's structure/content and presentation, and progressive enhancement to support user agents that may not support certain JavaScript functionality and users that have disabled JavaScript. ==Overview== The emergence of standards-compliant browsers, JavaScript frameworks, and high- quality debugging tools have made organized, scalable JavaScript code possible, and the emergence of Ajax interfaces has made it desirable. Whereas JavaScript was once reserved for relatively simple and non-critical tasks such as form validation and decorative novelties, it is now used to write large, complex codebases that are often part of a site's core functionality. The concept of \\"unobtrusiveness\\" in relation to JavaScript programming was coined in 2002 by Stuart Langridge in the article \\"Unobtrusive DHTML, and the power of unordered lists\\". In the article Langridge argued for a way to keep all JavaScript code, including event handlers, outside of the HTML. Stuart Langridge has since expanded upon this thought in book (Reference to the first edition, since it shows how the author pioneered the concept.) and article format.E.g.: Other authors have tried to refine and define the essential elements of unobtrusiveness. David Flanagan's book JavaScript: The Definitive Guide said that while there is no specific formula, there are three main goals: * To separate JavaScript from HTML markup, as well as keeping modules of JavaScript independent of other modules. * Unobtrusive JavaScript should degrade gracefully‚Äîall content should be available without all or any of the JavaScript running successfully. * Unobtrusive JavaScript should not degrade the accessibility of the HTML, and ideally should improve it, whether the user has personal disabilities or are using an unusual, or unusually configured, browser. The Web Standards Project described four benefits of unobtrusive DOM scripting in their JavaScript Manifesto. # Usability: An unobtrusive DOM script does not draw the attention of the user‚Äîvisitors use it without thinking about it. # Graceful degradation: Unobtrusive DOM scripts never generate error messages, in any browser, even when they fail. If features cannot be presented properly, they silently disappear. # Accessibility: If any script fails, the page still delivers its core functions and information via the markup, stylesheets and/or server-side scripting. # Separation: For the benefit of other and future web developers, all JavaScript code is maintained separately, without impacting other files of script, markup or code. For the Paris Web Conference in 2007, Christian Heilmann identified seven rules of Unobtrusive JavaScript. # Do not make any assumptions: Defensive programming techniques should allow for the possibilities that JavaScript may not run, the browser may not support expected methods, the HTML may have changed, unexpected input devices may be in use and other scripts may either not be present or may be encroaching on the global namespace. # Find your hooks and relationships, such as IDs and other aspects of the expected HTML. # Leave traversing individual DOM objects to the experts, such as to the CSS handler built into the browser where possible. # Understand browsers and users, particularly how they fail, what assumptions they make, and unusual configurations or usages. # Understand events, including how they 'bubble' and the features of the \`Event\` object that is passed to most event handlers. # Play well with other scripts by avoiding global function and variable names. # Work for the next developer by using self-explanatory variable and function names, creating logical and readable code, making dependencies obvious, and commenting any code that still might confuse. ==Separation of behavior from markup== Traditionally, JavaScript was often placed inline together with an HTML document's markup. For example, the following is a typical way to register a JavaScript event handler in HTML: The purpose of HTML markup is to describe a document's structure, not its programmatic behavior. Combining the two can negatively impact a site's maintainability, like combining content and presentation. JavaScript behavior created and referenced in the HTML can be harder to use and maintain, for example when setting handlers for several events on a single element, when setting the same event handler on several elements, or when using event delegation. The unobtrusive solution is to register the necessary event handlers programmatically, rather than inline. Rather than adding an \`onchange\` attribute explicitly as above, the relevant element(s) are simply identified, for example by \`class\`, \`id\` or some other means in the markup: A script that runs when the page is first loaded into the browser can then look for each relevant element and set it up accordingly: window.addEventListener(\\"DOMContentLoaded\\", function(event) { document.getElementById('date').addEventListener(\\"change\\", validateDate); }); ==Namespaces== Unobtrusive JavaScript should add as little as possible to the global object or global namespace of the environment in which it runs. Other scripts may override any variable or function that is created in the global namespace, and this can lead to unexpected failures that are difficult to debug. JavaScript does not have a built-in explicit namespace mechanism, but the desired effects are easy to produce using the language's facilities. Flanagan suggests the use of the developer's own domain name, dotted segments reversed, as a single global name to publish that is very likely to be unique, in the style developed in the Java language. var org = org  {}; if (typeof org !== 'object') { throw new Error(\\"org already defined as non-object\\"); } org.example = org.example  {}; if (typeof org.example !== 'object') { throw new Error(\\"org.example already defined as non-object\\"); } While variables, functions and objects of all kinds can be further defined within such namespace objects, it is usually recommended to use closures within the namespace to further isolate what will become private variables and functions, as well as to export what will be the public interface of each module of functionality. The code above could be followed directly by the following, which uses an IIFE to establish its closure: org.example.Highlight = (function() { // Define private data and functions var highlightId = 'x'; function setHighlight(color) { document.getElementById(highlightId).style.color = color; } // Return public pointers to functions or properties // that are to be public. return { goGreen: function() { setHighlight('green'); }, goBlue: function() { setHighlight('blue'); } } }()); // End of closure From any other module, these public methods could be invoked in either way as follows org.example.Highlight.goBlue(); var h = org.example.Highlight; h.goGreen(); In this way, each module-writer's code is contained in private or in a unique namespace and cannot interfere with or intrude upon any other code at any time. ==Degrading gracefully== Writing an event listener that detects the loading of the HTML page and then adds relevant listeners to other events on the page, as well as other behaviors as required, can solve the problem of separating JavaScript functionality from HTML markup. The use of client-side JavaScript libraries such as jQuery, MooTools or Prototype can simplify this process and help ensure that individual browser and browser version implementation details are hidden and catered for. Keeping most of the JavaScript out of the default namespace helps ensure that it is as unobtrusive as possible in that sense. A further criterion of unobtrusive JavaScript that is often cited is to ensure that added behavior degrades gracefully on those browsers with unexpected configurations, and those on which the user may have disabled JavaScript altogether. This requirement is a basic tenet of web accessibility, to ensure that JavaScript-enhanced websites are not only usable by people of all abilities and disabilities but that all users‚Äîwhatever their computing platform‚Äîget equal access to all the site's information and functionality. Sometimes there is extra work involved in achieving this, but web accessibility is not an optional extra in many countries. For example, in the UK, the Equality Act 2010, while it does not refer explicitly to website accessibility, makes it illegal to discriminate against people with disabilities and applies to anyone providing any service in the public, private and voluntary sectors. While a lot of effort may be put into designing and implementing a slick client-side user interface in unobtrusive JavaScript, it will not remain unobtrusive to a user without client-side scripting if they find that they cannot access published information. To meet this goal, it is often necessary to implement equivalent, albeit clunkier, server-side functionality that will be available without the use of JavaScript at all. Take, for example, a webpage where thumbnail images need JavaScript behaviours so that full-size images will appear in front of the page when the mouse is rolled over them or they are clicked. First, server-side markup should ensure that the relevant full-size image is served to users without JavaScript who click on a thumbnail. In this case the basic HTML markup may look like the following, for each thumbnail: [ ![Image 1 shows... etc](image-001-thumb.png) ](fullsize-image-001.png \\"Click for full-size image\\") This will work as it is without JavaScript. Unobtrusive JavaScript, in this case, during page-load, could find all the \`a\` elements that have a class of \`manual-link\` and remove them from the page DOM. It could then find all the images of class \`thumb\` and attach an \`onmouseover\` or an \`onclick\` event handler that is specified in- line to provide the slick behaviour. For example, when invoked the event handler may send an Ajax request to the server for the full-size image, then add a \`div\` to the page DOM invoking existing CSS so it appears in front of existing content, which itself may become partially greyed out. The \`div\` will need a close button, perhaps a visual 'spinner' to show that data is loading, etc. Finally, when the Ajax data arrives, the handler hides the spinner and inserts the full-size image into the new \`div\` for display. This way, all the client-side functionality depends on the same JavaScript function. If that function succeeds, it begins by removing the basic, manual behavior, and goes on to add the client-side scripted behavior. If the script fails for whatever reason, the manual behavior remains in place and remains functional. ==Best practices== Though the essence of unobtrusive JavaScript is the concept of an added separate behavior layer, its advocates generally have subscribed to a number of related principles, such as: * DOM Scripting, i.e. adherence to the W3C DOM and event model, and avoidance of browser-specific extensions. * Capability detection, i.e. testing for specific functionality before it is used. In particular this is seen as the opposite of browser detection. * More generally, JavaScript best practices often parallel those in other programming languages, such as encapsulation and abstraction layers, avoidance of global variables, meaningful naming conventions, use of appropriate design patterns, and systematic testing. ==See also== * Graceful degradation * Progressive enhancement ==References== Category:JavaScript Category:Web accessibility Category:Responsive web design Category:Adaptive Web Design ","title":"Unobtrusive JavaScript"},{"id":"9136221","text":"St Wilfrid Church, Gilstead.

It was produced by Fernando Ayala and Luis O. Repetto, and stars Federico Luppi, Miguel √Ångel Sol√°, Ulises Dumont, H√©ctor Bidonde and V√≠ctor Laplace. ==Plot== Ricardo Guglielmini is the mayor of Colonia Vela, a small country village in an undisclosed province of central Argentina. He plots with H√©ctor Suprino, a local Peronist spin doctor, and Reinaldo, a union leader, to get the town's deputy mayor, Ignacio Fuentes, kicked out of office, due to his increasing popularity, which threatens Guglilemini's decades-long hold on the mayorship. Fuentes is told that he has to fire his assistant Mateo because of his Marxist sympathies. Fuentes, despite disagreeing with Marxist ideals himself, declines, refusing to be politically strong-armed. Taking advantage of this, Guglilemini publicly accuses Fuentes of aiding communist guerillas as an excuse to fire him or get him to resign. When Fuentes refuses, Gugliemini sends the police to arrest him, but Fuentes, rather than cave in to the pressure, takes to arms and then barricades himself in the town hall, along with his allies and friends; Mateo, Corporal Garc√≠a, Juan, Rodrigo, Moyito and Crazy Ceres. Guglielmini orders the police to storm the building, which leads to a massive stand-off between the local police force and Fuentes' men. The counter-Fuentes operation, led by Chief Llanos and Sub-Chief Rossi, initially only attempts to threaten Fuentes into surrendering, but soon evolves into a real shootout when members of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance, led by Rogelio Almeido, show up and intervene. During the shootout with the AAA, Moyito is killed and several police officers are wounded, which leads to a temporary ceasefire and a deadlock. Juan sneaks out through the back to look for the local crop duster pilot, Cervi√±o, in order to convince him to help Fuentes by conducting an aerial attack as a distraction so he can sneak more ammo and explosives into the building. As night falls, a group of delusional local leftist guerrilla youths, led by Matilda G√≥mez, gather in an abandoned warehouse and make a completely unrealistic and blatantly flawed plan to use the conflict as a means to start a civil war in Argentina, take over the government and convert the country into a communist state. They start out by kidnapping Chief Llanos and holding him for a ransom of several tons of explosives and weaponry. Not wanting to give more resources to the communists, Guglielmini abandons Llanos and declares Rossi the new police chief. Rossi leads a new attack on Fuentes, this time using bulldozers as cover to advance on the town hall. Rodrigo and Crazy Ceres are killed during this attack and Fuentes, Garc√≠a and Mateo are barely saved because Cervi√±o arrives in the nick of time and sprays pesticides all over the police with his plane, causing them to temporarily disperse. The guerrillas attack the local union with a pipe bomb, killing Reinaldo, which prompts the AAA agents to abandon the fight against Fuentes and instead attempt to kill the guerrilla troopers. Famed local Radical former senator Prudencio G√∫zman attempts to negotiate with the communists for Llanos' release, but the peace talks fall through and Llanos is ultimately executed. The police regroup and prepare for a third attack. In order to buy some time and distract Rossi, Mateo turns himself in while Fuentes, Garc√≠a and Juan prepare a bomb with the explosives the latter had previously brought in. Regardless of Mateo's surrender, the raid proceeds and, when the police storms the town hall, the bomb goes off, killing several police officers and giving Fuentes, Garc√≠a and Juan enough time to escape through the back. In retaliation, Almeido kills Mateo. Despite managing to escape the town hall, the trio are soon found by the police and Fuentes and Garc√≠a are taken captive. Juan, however, manages to escape. Desperate, he contacts the guerrillas, who promise to help free Fuentes and Garc√≠a if Juan shows them where he keeps his explosives stash. Juan additionally convinces Cervi√±o to cause one more diversion with his plane. Juan and the guerrillas, this time led by Matilda G√≥mez herself, carry out an attack on the school. First, Cervi√±o uses his plane to drop manure on the police, distracting them long enough to allow Juan and Matilda to sneak into the building. Once inside, they bust Garc√≠a free, but due to AAA reinforcements, they're forced to leave Fuentes behind. The AAA and the communists face off in a massive shootout inside the school, which ends with most people on both sides dead. Cervi√±o and his plane are followed by one of the few surviving AAA members, who shoots him when he lands. While fleeing the shootout at the school, Matilda and the other three surviving guerrillas get blown up by Almeido, who finishes them off in a suicide bombing. Suprino severely beats Fuentes and then Guglielmini tries to talk him into taking the blame for the whole ordeal. When he refuses, Guglielmini and Suprino leave, letting Rossi execute Fuentes. While leaving town, Suprino realizes Guglielmini plans to frame him for inciting the whole incident, so he runs him over with his truck before escaping. When morning finally dawns, Garc√≠a and Juan go to Cervi√±o's house, where they find him, wounded but still alive. To comfort him in his dying moments, they tell him Fuentes won the battle. Cervi√±o makes them promise to tell General Per√≥n about him if he ever returns to the country, after which he dies. Once they've buried Cervi√±o, Juan and Garc√≠a begin to head into the countryside while discussing the many ways they could convince Per√≥n to return. The song \\"Mi Buenos Aires Querido\\" begins to play as the credits start rolling. ==Cast== * Federico Luppi as Ignacio Fuentes * Miguel √Ångel Sol√° as Juan * Julio de Grazia as Corporal Garcia * Ulises Dumont as Cervi√±o * Lautaro Mur√∫a as Mayor Guglielmini * H√©ctor Bidonde as H√©ctor Suprino * Rodolfo Ranni as Police Chief Llanos * Raul Rizzo as Sub-Chief Rossi * Luis Mart√≠nez Rusconi as Rogelio Almeido * Emilio Vidal as Reinaldo * Victor Laplace as Prudencio G√∫zman * Alicia Baistrocchi as Matilda G√≥mez * Jos√© Mar√≠a Lopez as Mateo * Arturo Maly as Toto * Graciela Dufau as Mrs. Fuentes * Patricio Contreras as Police Officer Comini * Fernando Iglesias as Moyanito * Mar√≠a Socas as Girl with the JP group * Salo Pasik as Journalist * Rodolfo Brindisi as \\"Crazy\\" Pel√°ez * H√©ctor Olivera as Rebel (cameo) * Osvaldo Soriano as Rebel (cameo) ==Background== The film is based on real political event that took place in Argentina in the mid-1970s. The film depicts, sub silentio, the struggle between the Montoneros political movement and the right-wing Peronist forces. The Montonero Peronist Movement () was an Argentine left-wing Peronist guerrilla group, active during the 1970s. Its motto was venceremos (\\"we will conquer\\"). After Juan Per√≥n's return from 20 years of exile and the June 20, 1973 Ezeiza massacre, which marked the definitive split between left and right-wing Peronism, the Montoneros were expelled from the Justicialist party in May 1974 by Per√≥n. The group was almost completely dismantled in 1977, during Jorge Rafael Videla's dictatorship. ==Distribution== Funny Dirty Little War first opened in Argentina on September 22, 1983. It has been featured at various film festivals including the Toronto Festival of Festivals; the Berlin International Film Festival; the Cognac Festival du Film Policier, Cognac, France; and the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York City. ==ReceptionCritical response=== Vincent Canby, writing for The New York Times, complimented the acting, pacing, and H√©ctor Olivera's directorial style, and wrote, \\"The film has also been so cannily paced - and is so well acted - that there's never much time to consider larger meanings while the mayhem is going on.

Lowther was a benefactor of William Moon, funding the construction of his workroom in 1856 and donating to the Moon Society, which distributed literature for the blind in Moon type. He inherited the family baronetcy from his brother in 1868. Dying in 1894 at the age of ninety, Lowther was succeeded in the baronetcy by his grandson, Charles Bingham Lowther.

Demethylase enzymes are important in epigenetic modification mechanisms. The demethylase proteins alter transcriptional regulation of the genome by controlling the methylation levels that occur on DNA and histones and, in turn, regulate the chromatin state at specific gene loci within organisms. == Oxidative demethylation  Histone demethylation === Mechanisms of lysine demethylation by lysin demethylase 1A (KDM1A) and by JmjC-domain-containing histone demethylases (JHDMs). Both mechanisms involve the oxidation of a methyl group (with FAD or Œ±-ketoglutarate and molecular oxygen as oxidizing agents) followed by elimination of formaldehyde. KDM1A requires a hydrogen atom (green) bound to the methylated nitrogen to exert its demethylase activity and can therefore only demethylate mono- and dimethylated lysines. For many years histone methylation was thought to be irreversible, due to the fact that the half-life of the histone methylation was approximately equal to the half-life of histones themselves. In 2004, Shi et al. published their discovery of the histone demethylase LSD1 (later classified as KDM1A), a nuclear amine oxidase homolog. Since then many more histone demethylases have been found. Defined by their mechanisms, two main classes of histone demethylases exist: a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent amine oxidase, and an Fe(II) and Œ±-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylase. Both operate by hydroxylation of a methyl group, followed by dissociation of formaldehyde. Demethylation has implications for epigenetics. Histone demethylase proteins have a variety of domains that serve different functions. These functions include binding to the histone (or sometimes the DNA on the nucleosome), recognizing the correct methylated amino acid substrate and catalyzing the reaction, and binding cofactors. Cofactors include: alpha-keto glutarate (JmjC-domain containing demethylases), CoREST (LSD), FAD, Fe (II) or NOG (N-oxalylglycine). Domains include: :SWIRM1 (Swi3, Rsc, and Moira domain): Proposed anchor site for histone molecules; found in several chromatin modifying complexes; facilitates demethylase protein and co-factor CoREST (nucleosomal substrate binding) :Jumonji (N/C terminal domains): Binding domain of key cofactors such as alpha-keto glutarate; connected by a beta-hairpin/mixed domain :PHD-finger: hydrophobic cage of residues that acts to bind methylated peptides; plays key role in recognition and selectivity for methylated histone residues :Zinc- finger: DNA binding domain :Amine oxidase domain: catalytic active site of LSD proteins; larger than related proteins to help fit size of the histone tail Structure of JmJDA (coordinates from PDB file:2UXX); Some domains from above are highlighted: JmJ(N-terminus, red; C-terminus, yellow), Zinc finger domain (light purple), Beta-hairpin (light blue), and mixed domain linker (green). Structure of KDM1A (coordinates from PDB file:2Z5U) There are several families of histone demethylases, which act on different substrates and play different roles in cellular function. A code has been developed to indicate the substrate for a histone demethylase. The substrate is first specified by the histone subunit (H1, H2A, H2B, H3, H4) and then the one letter designation and number of the amino acid that is methylated. Lastly, the level of methylation is sometimes noted by the addition of \\"me#\\", with the numbers being 1, 2, and 3 for monomethylated, dimethylated, and trimethylated substrates, respectively. For example, H3K9me2 is histone H3 with a dimethylated lysine in the ninth position. ;KDM1:The KDM1 family includes KDM1A and KDM1B. KDM1A (also referred to as LSD1/AOF2/BHC110) can act on mono- and dimethylated H3K4 and H3K9, and KDM1B (also referred to as LSD2/AOF1) acts only on mono- and dimethylated H3K4. These enzymes can have roles critical in embryogenesis and tissue-specific differentiation, as well as oocyte growth. KDM1A was the first demethylase to be discovered and thus it has been studied most extensively. :Deletion of the gene for KDM1A can have effects on the growth and differentiation of embryonic stem cells and can lead to embryonic lethality in knockout mice, who do not produce the KDM1A gene product. KDM1A is also thought to play a role in cancer, as poorer outcomes can be correlated with higher expression of this gene. Therefore, the inhibition of KDM1A may be a possible treatment for cancer. KDM1A has many different binding partners, which may be necessary for its demethylation activity. :KDM1B, however, is mostly involved in oocyte development. Deletion of this gene leads to maternal effect lethality in mice. Orthologs of KDM1 in D. melanogaster and C. elegans appear to function similarly to KDM1B rather than KDM1A. ;KDM2:The KDM2 family includes KDM2A and KDM2B. KDM2A (also referred to as JHDM1A/FBXL11) can act on mono- and dimethylated H3K36 and trimethylated H3K4. KDM2B (also referred to as JHDM1B/FBXL10) acts only on mono- and dimethylated H3K36. KDM2A has roles in either promoting or inhibiting tumor function, and KDM2B has roles in oncogenesis. :In many eukaryotes, the KDM2A protein contains a CXXC zinc finger domain capable of binding unmethylated CpG islands. It is currently thought that KDM2A proteins may bind to many gene regulatory elements without the aid of sequence specific transcription factors. Although the role of KDM2 in eukaryotic developmental differentiation is still largely a mystery, both KDM2A and KDM2B have been shown to play roles in tumor growth and suppression. KDM2B has been shown to be over-expressed in human lymphomas and adenocarcinomas; prostate cancers and glioblastomas, however, show reduced expression of both KDM2A and KDM2B. Additionally, KDM2B has been shown to prevent senescence in some cells through ectopic expression further indicating its potential as an oncogene. ;KDM3:The KDM3 family includes KDM3A, KDM3B and JMJD1C. KDM3A (also referred to as JHDM2A/JMJD1A/TSGA) can act on mono- and dimethylated H3K9. The substrates for KDM3B (also referred to as JHDM2B/JMJD1B) and JMJD1C (also referred to as JHDM2C/TRIP8) are not known. The KDM3A has roles in spermatogenesis and metabolic functions; the roles are of KDM3B and JMJD1C are unknown. : Knockdown studies of KDM3A in mice, where the mouse produces reduced levels of KDM3A, resulted in male infertility and adult onset-obesity. Additional studies have indicated that KDM3A may play a role in regulation of androgen receptor-dependent genes as well as genes involved in pluripotency, indicating a potential role for KDM3A in tumorigenesis. ;KDM4:The KDM4 family includes KDM4A, KDM4B, KDM4C, and KDM4D. These are also referred to as JMDM3A/JMJD2A, JMDM3B/JMJD2B, JMDM3C/JMJD2C, and JMDM3D/JMJD2D, respectively. These enzymes can act on di- and trimethylated H3K9, H3K36, H1K26. KDM4B and KDM4C have roles in tumorigenesis, and the role of KDM4D is unknown. :The KDM4 family of proteins have been linked to malignant transformation. Specifically, KDM4C amplification has been documented in oesophageal squamous carcinomas, medulloblastomas and breast cancers; amplification of KDM4B has also been found in medulloblastomas. Other gene expression data has also suggested KDM4A, KDM4B, and KDM4C are over- expressed in prostate cancer. ;KDM5:The KDM5 family includes KDM5A, KDM5B, KDM5C, and KDM5D. These are also referred to as JARID1A/RBP2, JARID1B/PLU-1, JARID1C/SMCX, and JARID1D/SMCY, respectively. These enzymes can act on di- and trimethylated H3K4. :KDM5 protein family appear to play key developmental functions. The deletion of the JmjC domain of retinoblastoma binding protein related 2 (RBR-2) in C. elegans express defects in vulva formation. Mutations to the JmjC domain in Drosophila causes either lethal effects on larval or many developmental defects in those that survive. :KDM5A in cell culture systems have also shown links to regulation of differentiation, mitochondrial function, cell cycle progression. KDM5B and KDM5C have also shown to interaction with PcG proteins, which are involved in transcriptional repression. KDM5C mutations (found on the X-chromosome) have also been found in patients with X-linked mental retardation. Depletion of KDM5C homologs in D. rerio have shown brain-patterning defects and neuronal cell death. ;KDM6:The KDM6 family includes KDM6A, KDM6B, and UTY. KDM6A (also referred to as UTX) and KDM6B (also referred to as JMJD3) act on di- and trimethylated H3K27 and have roles in development; the substrate and role of UTY is unknown. On the whole, both KDM6A and KDM6B possess tumor-suppressive characteristics. KDM6A knockdowns in fibroblasts lead to an immediate increase in fibroblast population. KDM6B expressed in fibroblasts induces oncogenes of the RAS_RAF pathway. Deletions and point mutations of KDM6A have been identified as one cause of Kabuki Syndrome, a congenital disorder resulting in intellectual disability. :Other possible roles have been suggested for KDM6B. Specifically in one study, mutating homologs of KDM6B disrupted gonadal development in C.elegans. Other studies have shown that KDM6B expression is up-regulated in activated macrophages and dynamically expressed during differentiation of stem cells. :On the other hand, depletion of homologs of KDM6A in D. rerio have shown decreased expression of HOX genes, which play a role in regulating body patterning during development. In mammalian studies, KDM6A has been shown to regulate HOX genes as well. == Ester demethylation == Cartoon representation of the molecular structure of protein registered with 1A2O pdb code. Another example of a demethylase is protein-glutamate methylesterase, also known as CheB protein (EC 3.1.1.61), which demethylates MCPs (methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins) through hydrolysis of carboxylic ester bonds. The association of a chemotaxis receptor with an agonist leads to the phosphorylation of CheB. Phosphorylation of CheB protein enhances its catalytic MCP demethylating activity resulting in adaption of the cell to environmental stimuli. MCPs respond to extracellular attractants and repellents in bacteria like E. coli in chemotaxis regulation. CheB is more specifically termed a methylesterase, as it removes methyl groups from methylglutamate residues located on the MCPs through hydrolysis, producing glutamate accompanied by the release of methanol. CheB is of particular interest to researchers as it may be a therapeutic target for mitigating the spread of bacterial infections. Chemotaxis signalling. Chemoattractants or repellents are sensed by transmembrane receptors. Note the role of CheB (B) in demethylation of MCP receptors. == See also == * Chemotaxis * Esterase * Transferase * Methylase == References == Category:EC 3.1.1 Category:EC 1.14.11 Category:EC 1.5.8 Category:Signal transduction ","title":"Demethylase"},{"id":"9136344","text":"Jo Hall (born 25 June 1958) is an Australian television presenter.

Before Shinjo can punish him, the police raid the gang's office, saving Junpei's life by landing him in prison for five years. Upon release, he offers 5 million yen to the invincible professional bodyguard Kiba of the Kaito Karate dojo to escort him to the hidden loot so that he can find his girlfriend Yoko, a Taiwanese prostitute, and escape forever. Junpei is ambushed outside of the prison but Kiba fights off the attackers. Junpei grabs one of their guns, meaning that they cannot board a plane and they are forced to travel back to Okinawa by boat. Aboard the boat they are attacked by Okinawan karateka hired by Shinjo. Junpei attempts to use his gun but Kiba prevents him from using it and defeats the attackers with karate, after which Junpei throws his gun in the ocean before they arrive in Okinawa. Shinjo plants a fake quotes in the newspaper of Kiba ridiculing Okinawa Karate, causing Okinawa Karate to present a formal letter of challenge to Kiba. Tetsugen Daito, head of the Daito Karate school, accepts the challenge on Kiba's behalf defeats all of the challengers unarmed, yet others continue to attack Kiba and Junpei as they search for Yoko. They find Yoko but the Soryu Group has gotten her addicted to heroin and she works with them to fake her own kidnapping as well as the kidnapping of Tetsugen Daito's assistant Maki. Shinjo calls Junpei and demands the missing 500 million yen in exchange for the two women. Junpei retrieves the money from inside heavy bags at his old boxing gym. Later, a member of the Okinawa Karate school who is also an Okinawa police officer informs them that Maki is being held at Club Satine and that Yoko has become Shinjo's moll. The three men sneak into the club and rescue Maki, who helps them fight the other members of the Soryu Group at Shinjo's hideout. Junpei and Kiba defeat Junpei's old rival Yasunaga, then they confront Shinjo and Yoko on the roof. Shinjo gives Yoko a gun to kill Junpei but instead she shoots herself through the heart, killing herself as well as Shinjo behind her. Junpei leaves for Tokyo, promising to pay Kiba's fee when he arrives. The Okinawa cop then challenges Kiba for the honor of the Okinawa Karate school but is defeated in a battle of karate. ==Cast== *Hisao Maki - Tetsugen Daito *Masaru Matsuda *Daisuke Nagekura - Junpei *Ren Osugi - Shinjo *Megumi Sakita - Maki Kasuga *Shinobu Tanaka - Yoko *Takeshi Yamato - Naoto Kiba ==Sequels== Two sequels were released: * (also known as Bodyguard Kiba 2: Combat Apocalypse) was released on October 22, 1994. * (also known as Bodyguard Kiba 3: Second Apocalypse of Carnage) was released on February 3, 1995. ==Reception== Alexander Knoth of Asian Movie Pulse gave the film a positive review, writing that \\"Miike manages to keep a fast pace, which is sometimes a problem with his other movies.

Agnew is the son of an English father, footballer John Agnew, and a Flemish mother. He is influenced by action movies, superheroes, comic books and a great variety of music, ranging from Tom Jones and musicals to heavy metal and the new-age music his sister played. His \\"rock 'n' roll comedy\\" (as he himself calls it) is mostly a mix of blue comedy and the production of sound effects, similar to Dutch-Moroccan comedian Najib Amhali. Besides his comedy activities, he is also the lead vocalist of hard rock band Diablo Blvd. His first solo comedy show, \\"KA-BOOM!\\", spanned the whole 2005-2006 season.

Barnard was born into a large and gifted family in Sheffield, Massachusetts.Warner, 1964, p. 19 for birth date and place. His brother, Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard was a longtime educator and president of Columbia University and namesake of Barnard College in New York City.New York Times obituary, April 26, 1889 Both John and Frederick, as well as most members of their family, suffered from a hereditary form of deafness which intensified in later years.Warner, 1964, p. 19 refers to his \\"inherited deafness.\\" In early life, when stationed in New Orleans, Barnard married Jane Elizabeth Brand, of Maryland, with whom he had four children. In 1860, he married Anna E. Hall of Harford County, Maryland, with whom he had three children.Abbot, Henry L., Biographical Memoir of John Gross Barnard, 1815‚Äì1882, p. 9 (227), Read before the National Academy of Sciences, April 17, 1902. http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/jbarnard.pdf, retrieved October 12, 2010. This paper was included in a book of biographical sketches published by the National Academy of Sciences as the page number in parenthesis indicates. The exact title of the book is not given in the web download which only contains the Abbot paper of 11 pages. In 1833, at the age of 18, Barnard graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, second in a class of forty-three cadets.Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 116, Cullum, 1891, pp. 530, 533 As one of the top graduates of his class, he was posted as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army Corps of Engineers, embarking on a 48-year career in that branch.Sifakis, Stewart, Who Was Who in the Civil War p. 33. Facts On File, New York, 1988. . Barnard's first assignment after being commissioned was as an assistant to Colonel Joseph G. Totten in constructing Fort Adams in Newport, Rhode Island, from 1833 to 1834. Totten was the foremost American military engineer of his day and served as Chief Engineer of the Army for much of Barnard's career. There the two formed a close friendship as evidenced by Barnard's extensive eulogy of Totten which was published in 1866. Throughout his career, Barnard served on many garrison and fortification details, most notably participating in the construction of coastal defenses at Fort Columbus/Fort Jay, Fort Hamilton and Fort Wadsworth in New York City, New Orleans, Pensacola, Mobile, Fort Livingston, Louisiana, Fort Jackson, Louisiana, Fort St. Philip, Louisiana and on the Pacific Coast at San Francisco.Warner, 1964, pp. 19‚Äì20 refers to fortifications on the Atlantic Coast, Pacific Coast, Delaware, breakwater and New York City. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, he headed the construction of American defenses at the captured Mexican port of Tampico,Warner, 1964, p. 20 ensuring that city's safety as a vital supply line for American forces advancing on Mexico City. He also worked on the survey of Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War battlefields. and as Chief Engineer for the Exploration and Survey of the projected Tehuantepec Railroad in Mexico, in 1850‚Äì1851.Cullum, 1891, p. 530 From May 31, 1855, through September 8, 1856, Barnard served as the Superintendent of the United States Military Academy,Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 116 succeeding Robert E. Lee.Warner, Ezra J., Generals in Gray, p. 181. Louisiana State University Press, Baton Rouge, 1959. . He then returned to work on coastal defenses, especially in the New York and New Jersey area. During a leave of absence, he studied construction projects in Europe. ==Civil War== Soon after the outbreak of the Civil War, U.S. Army commander Major General and Brevet Lieutenant General Winfield Scott, bearing in mind Barnard's success at defending his Tampico-based supply lines during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, assigned then Major Barnard to the Department of Washington. This was the Union Army unit in charge of defending Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. On April 28, 1861, Colonel Joseph K. Mansfield, the department commander, a former engineer himself, attached Barnard to his headquarters as chief engineer.Sifakis, 1988, p.33; General Orders No. 11, Department Of Washington, April 28, 1861. When the Union Army moved into Northern Virginia on May 24, 1861, Barnard oversaw the erection of fortifications on the Arlington hills.Sifakis, 1988, p. 33 He also accompanied the Army to Manassas in July 1861 and was present at the Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run (Manassas). Between June 1861 and September 1861, Barnard also served on the U.S. Navy's Blockade Strategy Board. Major General George B. McClellan assumed command of the Military Division of the Potomac, the troops around Washington, D.C., on July 23, 1861.Sifakis, 1988, p. 406 On August 15, 1861, McClellan was appointed to the command of the Army and Department of the Potomac, and Barnard became chief engineer of the Military District of Washington.On August 17, all the troops in the vicinity of Washington became part of the Army of the Potomac. Three days later, General Orders No. 1, Army of the Potomac, stated that Barnard was attached to the staff as chief engineer. As McClellan formulated his thoughts for fortifications around Washington, D.C., Barnard planned, designed and oversaw their construction. In Barnard's A Report on the Defenses of Washington, published after the Civil War, he commented on the complexity and ever-changing nature of the project: > From a few isolated works covering bridges or commanding a few especially > important points, was developed a connected system of fortification by which > every prominent point, at intervals of 800 to 1,000 yards, was occupied by > an inclosed field-fort every important approach or depression of ground, > unseen from the forts, swept by a battery for field-guns, and the whole > connected by rifle-trenches which were in fact lines of infantry parapet, > furnishing emplacement for two ranks of men and affording covered > communication along the line, while roads were opened wherever necessary, so > that troops and artillery could be moved rapidly from one point of the > immense periphery to another, or under cover, from point to point along the > line.\\"A Report on the Defenses of Washington,\\" Barnard, John G. 1871 On September 23, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Barnard to the grade of brigadier general, U.S. Volunteers, to rank from September 23, 1861.Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 718 Lincoln formally nominated Barnard as brigadier general on December 21, 1861, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the promotion on March 24, 1862. Barnard was Engineer for the Army of the Potomac between August 20, 1861, and August 16, 1862. He participated in the Peninsula Campaign and directed the siege works at Yorktown, Virginia, of offensive and defensive works on the Chickahominy River. On the march to Harrison's Landing on the James River, he reconnoitered and selected positions for the Battle of Gaines Mill, the passage of White Oak Swamp and the Battle of Malvern Hill. After the conclusion of his work in that campaign, he again was engaged in working on the defenses of Washington as chief engineer of the Department of Washington until May 1864. He had certain additional special assignments such as devising the defenses of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, during this period.Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 116; Sifakis, 1988, p. 33; Cullum, 1891, p. 531 Upon the death of the Chief of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Brigadier General Joseph Totten, on April 22, 1864, President Lincoln nominated Barnard to be the next Chief of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the grade of brigadier general, U.S. Army, but Barnard immediately asked that the nomination be withdrawn.Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 116. The promotion went to 65-year-old Colonel Richard Delafield instead. Delafield had been working on New York Harbor defenses. He was promoted to Chief of the Corps of Engineers with the rank of brigadier general to rank from April 22, 1864, on May 19, 1864. Warner, 1964, p. 118. Delafield was a Regular Army colonel and as such was senior to Barnard who was a Regular Army lieutenant colonel. Henry Larcom Abbot, Barnard's aide-de-camp in the Peninsula campaign and himself a brevet brigadier general, USA, brevet major general, USV, and colonel in the Army Corps of Engineers upon his retirement in 1895, suggested in a 1902 paper that Barnard's sense of justice probably made him feel that he should not take a promotion over an officer superior in rank at the time. Abbot, 1902, p. 9 (227); for Abbot information see Abbot, 1902, p. 10 (228); Hunt, Roger D. and Brown, Jack R., Brevet Brigadier Generals in Blue, p. 1. Olde Soldier Books, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, 1990. ; Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 97 Barnard was Engineer XXII Corps, Department of Washington, between February 2, 1863, and May 25, 1864. Between May 25, 1864, and June 5, 1864, he was Chief Engineer for the Army of the Potomac. He was on the staff of General Ulysses S. Grant in the Overland Campaign between June 5, 1864, and July 4, 1864. On July 4, 1864, President Lincoln nominated and the U. S. Senate confirmed the award to General Barnard of the honorary rank of brevet major general, U.S. Volunteers, to rank from July 4, 1864, for \\"Meritorious and Distinguished Services during the Rebellion.\\"Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 710; Cullum, 1891, p. 531 Barnard was appointed Chief Engineer of the armies in the field with his appointment to General Grant's staff. He remained in this position during the Siege of Petersburg, including the capture of Fort Harrison, the Battle of Hatcher's Run and the final assault on Petersburg, until the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox, Virginia, on April 9, 1865. General Barnard served in the honor guard for President Lincoln's funeral in April 1865. He was mustered out of the U.S. Volunteers on January 15, 1866. On April 10, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated and on May 4, 1866, the U.S. Senate confirmed the award to Barnard of the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general, USA, (Regular Army) to rank from March 13, 1865, for \\"Gallant and Meritorious Service in the Campaign terminating with the Surrender of the Insurgent Army under Gen. R. E. Lee.\\"Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 732, Cullum, 1891, p. 531 On July 17, 1866, President Johnson nominated and on July 23, 1866, the U.S. Senate confirmed the award to Barnard of the honorary grade of brevet major general, USA, to rank from March 13, 1865 \\"for Gallant and Meritorious Services in the Field during the Rebellion.\\"Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 706, Cullum, 1891, p. 532 ==Postbellum career== Barnard was promoted to colonel in the Regular Army on December 28, 1865, and continued his career in the Army Corps of Engineers until January 1881.A biographical sketch on the National Park Service web site states that Colonel Barnard also was appointed \\"Chief Engineer of the Regular Army.\\" http://www.nps.gov/cwdw/historyculture/john-gross-barnard.htm. The exact meaning of this title is not clear since no other source that is not obviously derived from the NPS web page notes appointment of Barnard or anyone else to a position with this title or a similar title in peacetime. Cullum, 1891, Abbot, 1902 and Warner, 1959 give details of Barnard's post-war assignments, including appointments to numerous Boards and Commissions within the Corps of Engineers, without using this title. Cullum, 1891, p. 532 gives Barnard's positions immediately after the war as follows: \\"as Member of the Board of Engineers, June 20, 1865, to May 18, 1867, to carry out in detail the modifications of the defenses in the vicinity of New York, as proposed by the Board of Jan. 27, 1864; as Senior Engineer of the defenses of New York harbor, and in charge of the construction of the Fortifications on Staten Island, New York, August 3, 1865, to December 10, 1866; as Member of Board for the Examination of Officers of Engineers for Promotion, Nov. 28, 1865, and Dec. 28, 1866.\\" Soon after the close of the war, Barnard was made president of the permanent Board of Engineers for Fortifications and River and Harbor Improvements, a position which he held until his retirement from active service, in January, 1881.Abbot, 1902, p. 7 (225) Barnard successfully recast the approach to coastal defenses which was required because of the obsolescence of wooden ships and muzzle loading guns. He also advocated the successful use of parallel jetties to improve the mouth of the Mississippi River.Warner, 1964, p. 20; Cullum, 1891, pp. 532‚Äì533 He was a prominent member of the United States Lighthouse Board from February 20, 1870, until his retirement on January 2, 1881.Cullum, 1891, p. 532 The production of scientific literature in the USA was fostered by Barnard:Edward Mathews Crane (1948) A Century of Book Publishing, page 3, from HathiTrust It was largely through the influence of General Barnard that David Van Nostrand was brought into close association with a group of young army officers who became his friends and later his authors and editorial consultants. Numbered among them were William T. Sherman, H. W. Halleck, Silas Casey, Philip St. George Cooke, Quincy Gillmore, Hugh L. Scott, George W. Cullum, Philip Sheridan and many others known to history. Barnard was an original member of the Aztec Club of 1847 as well as the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. Barnard was a co-founder of the United States National Academy of Sciences, as were several other senior officers of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.Cullum, 1891, p. 531; Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 116. These officers included General Totten, Major General, USV and Brigadier General, USA, Andrew Atkinson Humphreys, who was General Delafield's successor as Chief of the Corps of Engineers, and Colonel and Brevet Major General Abbot. Abbot, 1902, p. 7 (225); U.S. Army Corps of Engineers web site, Commanders of the Corps of Engineers, . Retrieved October 12, 2010. General Barnard retired from the Army on January 2, 1881 and died in Detroit, Michigan, on May 14, 1882. He is interred in Sheffield, Massachusetts. ==Writings== Barnard authored several scientific and engineering treatises and Civil War history papers.Eicher and Eicher, 2001, p. 116; Warner, 1964, p. 20 Among the more notable of these were: * Phenomena of the Gyroscope analytically examined. 1858. * Dangers and Defences of New York City. 1859. * Notes on Seacoast Defence. 1861. * The C.

Before they leave, they blackmail the administration into giving them one million yen as a parting gift by threatening to expose their secrets and ruin the reputation of the school. That night they follow the boss of the Kinsu sect, into an expensive hostess club and end up spending it all. The next day they respond to a job listing from the front company Takaranoyama Trading Ltd. offering 500,000 yen per month to young men with no experience and are forcibly conscripted into the Kinsu sect through contracts signed in blood, along with Tokichi Kinoshita, a student studying animal husbandry at Yamanosato University who ends up never being invited to participate in the activities of the other yakuza. Head Captain Kaizo Daimon attempts to help Makoto and Eiji obtain money through collision insurance fraud but they end up in a collision with a police car. Sabu ends up pawning his gold-plated Kinsu sect badge as well as those of Makoto and Eiji to pay off the debt incurred from their failed used panties business. At a hostess bar, Makoto encounters Keiko as she is leaving work and walks her home as she tells him about a film she will be starring in. Daimon and the boss of the Asashi sect get into a karaoke competition over a hostess named Akemi, then Daimon sees an ad to star in a pornographic film. Sabu informs Makoto that the production company, 7 Star Productions, is just a front company for the Asashi sect that produces porn. Makoto and Eiji race to the film set, where Daimon is realizing that the actress is not there willingly, and together they beat up the Asashi sect members and rescue Keiko. Hosoda of the Asashi sect calls Amachi and demands a finger from Makoto and a finger from Eiji as well as monetary compensation as an apology but Daimon asks to be allowed to settle the dispute and the big boss allows it. Daimon, Makoto, and Eiji confront the Asashi and Daimon threatens the Asashi boss with fake dynamite he obtained from Kinoshita until they withdraw the demand for the finger and compensation. The dynamite ends up being real and explodes, yet Daimon, Makoto, and Eiji are so tough that they survive intact. ==Cast== *Sei Hiraizumi *Kentar≈ç Nakakura *Hachir≈ç Oka *Yoshiyuki Omori *Gajiro Satoh *Tadashi Sat≈ç *Shingo Yamashiro *Rikiya Yasuoka *Tetsuya Yuuki ==External links== * Category:1995 films Category:Live-action films based on manga Category:Films directed by Takashi Miike Category:Films set in Osaka Category:Japanese action comedy films Category:Japanese direct- to-video films Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese-language films Category:V-Cinema ","title":"Osaka Tough Guys"},{"id":"9136562","text":"Paul Aim√© Fleury (born 1939) is an American physicist and academic administrator.

It consists of nine interlocking triangles that surround a central point known as a bindu. These triangles represent the cosmos and the human body. Because of its nine triangles, Shri Yantra is also known as the Navayoni Chakra. When the two- dimensional Shri Yantra is represented in three dimensions, it is called a Mahameru. Mount Meru derives its name from this shape. In addition to Mount Meru, all other yantras derive from the Shri Yantra. ==Appearance== The Lalita Sahasranama in diagrammatic form, showing how its nine interlocking triangles form a total of 43 smaller triangles.In the 2009 issue of Brahmavidya (the journal of the Adyar Library), Subhash Kak argues that the description of Shri Yantra is identical to the yantra described in the shrisukta in veda. The Shri Yantra's 9 constituent triangles vary in size and shape and intersect to form 43 smaller triangles, organized in 5 concentric levels. Together they represent the totality of the cosmos and express Advaita or non-duality. In the middle, the power point (bindu) represents the cosmic center. The triangles are circumscribed by two concentric circles composed of 8 and 16 petals, representing the lotus of creation and reproductive vital force. The entire configuration is framed by the broken lines of an earth square, representing a temple with four doors open onto the regions of the universe. Tipura Sundari yantra or the Shri yantra The Shri Chakra, frequently called the Shri Yantra. ==In religion== The worship of the Shri Yantra is central to the Shri Vidya system of Hindu worship. It represents the Goddess in the form of Devi Devi Tripura Sundari, the natural beauty of the three worlds: Bhu Loka (Physical Plane, Consciousness of the Physical Plane), Bhuvar Loka (Antariksha or Intermediate Space, Sub-Consciousness of the Prana) and Swar Loka (Svarga or Heaven or Super-Consciousness of the Divine Mind). The Shri Yantra is the symbol of Hinduism, which is based on the Hindu philosophy of the vedas. The Shri Yantra is the object of devotion in Shri Vidya. The Shri Yantra represents the evolution of the multiverse as a result of the natural Divine Will of the Godhead Aadi Paraa Shakti. The four upward-pointing isosceles triangles represent the Goddess's masculine embodiment Brahm, while the five downward-pointing triangles symbolize the female embodiment Jagat jannani. The Shri Yantra is also known as the nav chakra because it can be seen to consist of nine concentric layers that radiate outward from the bindu. (\\"Nau\\" or \\"nava\\" means \\"nine\\" in Sanskrit.) Each level corresponds to a mudra, a yogini and a specific form of the deity Tripura Sundari along with her mantra. The various deities residing in the nine levels of the Shri Yantra are described in the Devi Khadgamala Mantra. These levels, listed from outermost to innermost, are: #Trailokya Mohana, the outermost square, traced in three lines and interrupted by four recessed portals; #Sarvasaa Paripuraka, the outer lotus, consisting of 16 petals; #Sarva Samkshobahana, the inner lotus, consisting of 8 petals; #Sarva Saubhagyadayaka, the outermost ring of small triangles (14 in total); #Sarvarthasadhaka, the next ring of triangles (10 in total); #Sarva Rakshakara, a smaller ring of 10 triangles; #Sarva Rogahara, a ring of 8 small triangles; #Sarva Siddhiprada, one small triangle containing the bindu at its center; #Sarva Anandamaya, the bindu. ==See also== * Mandala * Religious symbolism * Sacred geometry * Seven logas ==References== Category:Hindu symbols Category:Hindu tantra Category:Indian iconography Category:Shaktism ","title":"Shri Yantra"},{"id":"9136622","text":"Daniel Harris may refer to: *Dan Harris (American football), college football coach and athletic director *Dan Harris (screenwriter) (born 1979), American screenwriter who co-wrote Superman Returns *Dan Harris (journalist) (born 1971), American television news correspondent *Dan Harris (politician) (born 1979), Canadian Member of Parliament *Daniel Harris (footballer) (born 1982), former Australian rules footballer *Daniel Harris (cricketer) (born 1979), cricketer for Australian domestic team Southern Redbacks *Daniel Harris (architect) (c. 1761‚Äì1840), civil engineer and architect *Daniel Harris, American alleged conspirator in the Gretchen Whitmer kidnapping plot *Danny Harris (born 1965), American hurdler *Danny Harris (rugby) (born 1937), rugby union and rugby league footballer of the 1950s and 1960s Wales (RU), Pontypridd, Cardiff, and Leigh (RL) *Daniel Harris, a character in the TV series The New Adventures of Old Christine *Daniel Gibson Harris (1915‚Äì2007), writer on Swedish naval history *Daniel J.

GFT is a registered charity. It occupies a purpose-built cinema building, first opened in 1939, and now protected as a category B listed building. ==History and architecture== Glasgow Film Theatre was built as the Cosmo by George Singleton in 1939 GFT's predecessor, the Cosmo, was Scotland's first arts cinema and only the second purpose-built arthouse in Britain, after the Curzon Mayfair in London. Opened on 18 May 1939, it was also the last cinema to be built in Glasgow before the outbreak of WW2. The Cosmo arrived at the close of an important decade for British film culture. With the advent of sound in film, language became a barrier and popular films from the continent quickly disappeared from British screens. In Glasgow, audiences for world cinema were served by the Film Society of Glasgow. Founded in 1929, this was the first cultural film group in Scotland, and its growing membership demonstrated a real appetite for foreign-language film in the city. In fact, Glaswegians in this period had a healthy appetite for film in general: in 1939, they went to the cinema an average 51 times a year, compared to 35 times for the rest of Scotland, and 21 times in England. And they were well-served for cinemas ‚Äì by the close of the decade, the city could boast 114 in all, with a total seating capacity of more than 175,000. But there was, as yet, no commercial arthouse cinema. Spotting a gap in the market, and hence avoiding the major film distributors\`routine of giving preference to UK-wide circuits, up stepped George Singleton,'Obituary: George Singleton' by David Bruce (The Independent, Friday 5 May 1995) whose cinemas included elegant art deco buildings designed for him by James McKissack. He now headed one of Glasgow's illustrious cinema chain families, and would become a co-founder of the Glasgow Citizen's Theatrehttp://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/Citizens.htm alongside James Bridie and Tom Honeyman. The name chosen of Cosmo was attractively brief for signage and advertising, and stemmed from cosmopolitan. Singleton appointed his usual architects James McKissack and WJ Anderson II to work on the new cinema. Their design for the Cosmo's geometric, windowless fa√ßade was influenced by the work of Willem Marinus Dudok, a leading Dutch modernist architect. The international theme was continued outside in the choice of cladding materials ‚Äì a mix of Ayrshire brick finished with faience cornices, set on a base of black Swedish granite ‚Äì and inside, where a globe was installed over the stalls entrance. In its original layout, there was just a single auditorium, seating 850. The Cosmo opened on Thursday 18 May, with an advertisement in the Glasgow Herald the following day promising future audiences a programme of ‚Äòcontinental fiction films, revivals of British and American fiction films, documentary films, cartoons and news reels. There is only one qualification ‚Äì they must be of first rate quality.‚ÄôGlasgow Herald, Friday 19 May 1939 The opening screening was Julien Duvivier's Un Carnet de Bal (1937). The opening also saw the first appearance of Mr Cosmo, a dapper and bowler-hatted cartoon figure based on George Singleton, designed by Charles Oakley, Chair of the Film Society and the Scottish Film Council . Mr Cosmo figured on posters and adverts for the cinema, and popped up on-screen ahead of the main feature in a pose ‚Äì comic or tragic ‚Äì appropriate to each release. Over the years, he would become a familiar figure to generations of Glasgow cinema-goers and can be glimpsed around the GFT building to this day. He also lives on in the name of GFT's downstairs caf√©. Quality European cinema was central to the Cosmo's programming from the start, with pre-reading of film catalogues being undertaken by Charles Oakley to assist the selections by George Singleton. Programmes in the summer of 1939 included La Grande Illusion (1937) and La Kermesse Heroique (1935). Though supplies dried up during WW2 and the cinema fell back on more mainstream English-language fare, screenings were enthusiastically resumed shortly thereafter. In February 1946, the Cosmo became the first cinema in the UK to screen a French film made under the Occupation, and Cosmo audiences also saw wartime German features, including ‚Äì in breathtaking Agfacolour ‚Äì The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1943).‚ÄòHats off to the Cosmo‚Äô by Ian Sutherland and Rudolph Kenna, Glasgow Herald, 27 May 1989 Big hits at the cinema included Hamlet (which ran for eleven weeks in 1948), Les Enfants du Paradis (1945), Jazz on a Summer's Day (1959) and Disney's Fantasia (1941), a long-running Cosmo Christmas favourite. A ‚ÄòCosmo Club‚Äô, offering films ‚Äòunblessed by the Censor's certificate‚Äô, opened in 1960. The Cosmo ran for three decades until economic circumstances dictated that it could not survive in its original form. On 21 April 1973 it was sold to the Scottish Film Council, re-opening the following year as the Glasgow Film Theatre with the former auditorium subdivided into a 404-seat cinema (now Screen 1) in the former balcony and a conference/exhibition space in the stalls. Mr Cosmo bowed out at a gala screening of Fantasia, announcing he would ‚Äòwatch with pride an affection this new development of the old tradition.‚Äô The new cinema opened on 2 May 1974 with a screening of Fellini's Roma. In its new guise, the cinema would continue to show films beyond the commercial mainstream. The key difference lay in GFT's broader remit. Taking London's National Film Theatre as a model, GFT continued to show the latest world cinema releases, but also advanced newer trends in film culture, collaborating with the Third Eye Centre (now the CCA Glasgow) to show experimental films, screening film seasons, retrospectives and late-night cult classics, and developing educational activities. In 1986 GFT became a registered charity and embarked on a campaign to raise money for a second cinema to replace the old basement conference room. Screen 2 (with seats for 142), and the downstairs caf√©-bar Caf√© Cosmo, opened for business in 1991. Edinburgh-based architect James Doherty returned in 1998 to revamp the foyer; in a nod to the original design, the new foyer includes a mosaic globe designed by American Glasgow-based artist Todd Garner set into the floor. In the same period, new sets of curtains were commissioned from Glasgow School of Art graduate Adrienne Brennan (Screen 1) and Glasgow studio Timorous Beasties (Screen 2),‚ÄòA trip to the stars‚Äô by Maureen Ellis (Evening Times, 19 August 2009) both of which reference the ‚Äòcosmos‚Äô in their design. In 1988 the building was B-listed by Historic Scotland. In 2013 caf√© cosmo was moved to the mezzanine level to make way for a 3rd cinema screen. Over the years GFT has played host to guests including Richard Attenborough, Elmer Bernstein, John Byrne (playwright), Danny Boyle, Simon Callow, Robert Carlyle, Robbie Coltrane, Sean Connery, Willem Dafoe, Carl Davis, Bill Forsyth, Stephen Fry, Peter Greenaway, David Hayman, Jane Horrocks, Eddie Izzard, Felicity Kendal, Anthony LaPaglia, Paul Laverty, Jonny Lee Miller, Janet Leigh, Mike Leigh, Ken Loach, Baz Luhrmann, David Lynch, Ewan McGregor, Hayley Mills, Peter Mullan, David Niven, David Puttnam, Jean-Paul Rappeneau, Christopher Reeve, Nicolas Roeg, Mickey Rooney, Paul Schrader, Martin Scorsese, Tilda Swinton, Quentin Tarantino, Giuseppe Tornatore and Max von Sydow. ==Films== GFT screens a wide variety of international cinema, classic films and documentaries alongside locally made work and material aimed at a range of community groups. In total, it shows over 600 different films every year, of which 60% are foreign- language. In addition to daily screenings of films, GFT is host to a number of clubs and activities including a Film Discussion Group in the upstairs bar to discuss new mainstream and foreign-language releases. Since 2005, GFT has been home to the Glasgow Film Festival (GFF). Held annually each February, the festival presents a programme of feature films, shorts, special events and live and interactive happenings from the GFT and other cinemas, galleries and unusual venues across the city. ==References== 9 Spies At The ABC - Vampires t The Odeon - Culture At The Cosmo: What We Watched In Glasgow Cinemas In The 1960s by Jim Doyle ==External links== *GFT website *Scottish Cinemas and Theatres Project Category:Cinemas in Glasgow Category:Category B listed buildings in Glasgow Category:Charities based in Glasgow Category:1939 establishments in Scotland Category:Theatres completed in 1939 ","title":"Glasgow Film Theatre"},{"id":"9136625","text":"Aaly is a given name.

This gave the President the power to \\"regulate the distribution, export, import, purchase and storage of food.\\"Clean Plate Club http://www.charitywire.com/charity10/04303.html President Woodrow Wilson released Executive order 2679-A creating the U.S. Food Administration and appointed Herbert Hoover as the head, enforcing this act. This organization was given the task of making sure that the limited amount of food America had as a result of World War I didn‚Äôt go to waste, and to avoid importation of food as much as possible. Hoover knew that many Americans were willing to volunteer and had a strong sense of patriotism during the war, so he used that to his advantage when he advertised the idea of the ‚ÄúClean Plate‚Äù campaign. Hoover promoted this idea to children who attended school with a pledge that read, ‚ÄúAt table I‚Äôll not leave a scrap of food upon my plate. And I‚Äôll not eat between meals, but for supper time I‚Äôll wait.‚Äù Pledge This targeted children too young to understand the value of food in the difficult economic time. Many necessities such as flour and sugar were in short supply, so Hoover used a sense of American nationalism to encourage families to take appropriate rations and save food. His goal was for people to eat less, use less essential ingredients, and to finish their entire meal. By doing this, young children developed the habit of eating everything given to them, thus ‚Äúcleaning their plate.‚Äù == Creating the club == The U.S. Food Administration was terminated after the First World War, but in 1947 the ‚ÄúClean Plate‚Äù proposal came back and was encouraged by President Harry S. Truman, who aided in officially forming the ‚ÄúClean Plates Club‚Äù in elementary schools across the country. This club was officially created after the Great Depression and World War II, when food was once again scarce. In 1947, the U.S. created the Marshall Plan, in which President Truman encouraged Americans to consume less poultry, to conserve food for starving Europeans. As a reaction to his plan, the ‚ÄúClean Plate Clubs‚Äù were formed, and elementary school students were again taught to clean their plates. == Currently == This concept now puts Americans at risk of unhealthy life styles. Studies show that 64% of Americans are now in danger of being overweight or obese. AICR http://www.aicr.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id;=7598&news;_iv_ctrl=0&abbr;=pr_ The ideal of completely finishing a serving has now become a bad habit, as food (in America) is no longer in short supply, and finishing the remainder of your meal is not a crucial belief any more. Today, portion sizes have increased considerably, shown by the fact that a serving of french fries today is twice the size of a 1950s serving, UT Southwestern Medical Center http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/utsw/cda/dept16498/files/145991.html making ‚Äúcleaning your plate‚Äù an unhealthy dietary action. It has been shown that parents who push their children to eat their entire meal may interfere with the self-control of their child, thus leading them to overeat, as well as creating a misunderstanding of an appropriate serving size. Some ‚ÄúClean Plate‚Äù cases may turn into psychological problems, or lead to developing eating disorders. Health experts indicate that completely finishing meals points you in a direction that moves towards obesity and continuous health problems such as cancer, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. == References == Category:Political catchphrases ","title":"Clean Plate Club"},{"id":"9136646","text":"Psycho: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture is the soundtrack album to the 1998 remake of Psycho. The record was released on December 1, 1998 by Geffen Records. ==Background== The album includes three adaptations of Bernard Herrmann's score to the original by Danny Elfman (Elfman's adaptation was later released on a separate album. The only released recordings of the original score are new performances by other orchestras, although the 1975 recording was conducted by the composer, Bernard Herrmann.) The rest of the album is made up of songs by rock, metal, country, trip hop, and drum and bass artists. Many of the songs were recorded for the album. Five songs sample the actual film: \\"Once Is Not Enough\\" repeats a number of Norman Bates and Marion Crane's lines from the 1998 version, and \\"Honeymoon Suite\\", \\"Madhouse\\", \\"All of My Life\\", and \\"In the End\\" all sample Bernard Herrmann's score to the original film. Two songs are cover versions: \\"Psycho\\", written by Leon Payne and here performed by Teddy Thompson, was previously recorded by Elvis Costello and Beasts of Bourbon, and \\"Psycho Killer\\", performed here by James Hall, was originally performed by the Talking Heads. Only two of the songs were already released by their respective artists at the time of the album's release: Rob Zombie's \\"Living Dead Girl\\" on his album Hellbilly Deluxe, and Girls Against Boys' \\"Psycho Future\\" on their album Freak*on*ica (both also Geffen releases). \\"Screaming\\" was later released by Pet Shop Boys as a B-side to their 1999 single \\"I Don't Know What You Want But I Can't Give It Anymore\\", and \\"Fly\\" was later included on Lamb's 1999 album Fear of Fours. \\"Madhouse\\" was the last song recorded by Mono before the band broke up. == Track listing == # \\"Prelude\\" (Bernard Herrmann) ‚Äì Danny Elfman # \\"Living Dead Girl\\" (Rob Zombie, Scott Humphrey) ‚Äì Rob Zombie # \\"Once Is Not Enough\\" (Howie B.) ‚Äì Howie B. # \\"Psycho\\" (Leon Payne) ‚Äì Teddy Thompson # \\"Screaming\\" (Neil Tennant, Chris Lowe, Tom Stephan) ‚Äì Pet Shop Boys # \\"Psycho Future\\" (GVSB) ‚Äì Girls Against Boys # \\"Honeymoon Suite\\" (Rob Garza, Eric Hilton) ‚Äì Thievery Corporation # \\"The Murder\\" (Herrmann) ‚Äì Danny Elfman # \\"Madhouse\\" (Martin Virgo) ‚Äì Mono # \\"Psycho Killer\\" (David Byrne, Tina Weymouth, Chris Frantz) ‚Äì James Hall # \\"All of My Life\\" (Steve Earle) ‚Äì Steve Earle # \\"Fly\\" (Andy Barlow, Louise Rhodes) ‚Äì Lamb # \\"In the End\\" (Justin Robertson, Roger Lyons) ‚Äì Lionrock # \\"The Finale\\" (Herrmann) ‚Äì Danny Elfman ==References== Category:Horror film soundtracks Category:1998 soundtrack albums Category:1990s film soundtrack albums Category:Geffen Records soundtracks Category:Psycho (franchise) ","title":"Psycho (soundtrack)"},{"id":"9136665","text":"This article lists notable Indian Christians.

Given the absence of established trading markets for these interests, the transfer of interests in private equity funds as well as hedge funds can be more complex and labor-intensive.Lemke, Lins, Hoenig & Rube, Hedge Funds and Other Private Equity Funds: Regulation and Compliance, ¬ß5:28; ¬ß¬ß13:34 - 13:38 (Thomson West, 2014 ed.). Sellers of private equity investments sell not only the investments in the fund but also their remaining unfunded commitments to the funds. By its nature, the private equity asset class is illiquid, intended to be a long-term investment for buy-and-hold investors, including \\"pension funds, endowments and wealthy families selling off their private equity funds before the pools have sold off all their assets\\". For the vast majority of private equity investments, there is no listed public market; however, there is a robust and maturing secondary market available for sellers of private equity assets. Buyers seek to acquire private equity interests in the secondary market for multiple reasons. For example, the duration of the investment may be much shorter than an investment in the private equity fund initially. Likewise, the buyer may be able to acquire these interests at an attractive price. Finally, the buyer can evaluate the fund's holdings before deciding to purchase an interest in the fund. Conversely, sellers may seek to sell interest for various reasons, including the need to raise capital, the desire to avoid future capital calls, the need to reduce an over-allocation to the asset class or for regulatory reasons.Lemke, Lins, Hoenig & Rube, Hedge Funds and Other Private Equity Funds: Regulation and Compliance, ¬ß13:34 (Thomson West, 2014 ed.). Driven by strong demand for private equity exposure over the past decade, a vast amount of capital has been committed to secondary market funds from investors looking to increase and diversify their private equity exposure. ==Secondary market participants== The private equity secondary market features dozens of dedicated firms and institutional investors that engage in the purchase and sale of private equity interests. Recent estimates by advisory firm Evercore gauged the overall secondary market's size for 2013 to be around $26 billion,Evercore: Distressed sellers 1% of 2013 market volume PEI Media, 14 April 2014 with approximately $45 billion of dry powder available at the end of 2013 and a further $30 billion expected to be raised in 2014.Evercore: secondaries funds target $30bn PEI Media, 14 April 2014 Such large volumes have been fueled by an increasing number of players over the years, which ultimately led to what today has become a highly competitive and fragmented market. Leading secondary investment firms with current dedicated secondary capital in excess of circa $3 billion include: AlpInvest Partners, Ardian (formerly AXA Private Equity), Capital Dynamics, Coller Capital, HarbourVest Partners, Lexington Partners, Pantheon Ventures, Partners Group and Neuberger Berman.The Private Equity Analyst Guide to the Secondary Market. Private Equity Analyst, 2004 Additionally, major investment banking firms including Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley have active secondary investment programs.Source: Private Equity Intelligence Other institutional investors typically have appetites for secondary interests. More and more primary investors, whether private equity funds-of- funds or other institutional investors, also allocate some of their primary program to secondaries. As the private equity secondary market matures, non- traditional secondary strategies are emerging. One such strategy is preferred capital, where both Limited Partners and General Partners can raise additional capital at net asset value whilst preserving ownership of their portfolio and its future upside. == Types of secondary transactions == Diagram of a simple secondary market transfer of a limited partnership fund interest. The buyer exchanges a single cash payment to the seller for both the investments in the fund plus any unfunded commitments to the fund. Secondary transactions can be generally split into two basic categories: ===Sale of fund interests=== A common secondary transaction, this category includes the sale of an investor's interest in a private equity fund or portfolio of interests in various funds through the transfer of the investor's limited partnership or LLC Member ownership interest in the fund(s). Nearly all types of private equity funds (e.g., including buyout, growth equity, venture capital, mezzanine, distressed, and real estate) can be sold in the secondary market. The transfer of the fund interest typically will allow the investor to receive some liquidity for the funded investments as well as a release from any remaining unfunded obligations to the fund. In addition to traditional cash sales, sales of fund interests are consummated through a number of structured transactions:The Private Equity Secondaries Market, A complete guide to its structure, operation and performance The Private Equity Secondaries Market, 2008  Structured joint ventures  ‚Äî Includes a wide variety of negotiated transactions between the buyer and seller that typically is customized to the specific needs of the buyer and seller. Typically, the buyer and seller agree on an economic arrangement that is more complex than a simple transfer of 100% ownership of the fund interest.  Securitization  ‚Äî An investor contributes its fund interests into a new vehicle (a collateralized fund obligation vehicle) which in turn issues notes and generates partial liquidity for the seller. Typically, the investor will also sell a portion of the equity in the leveraged vehicle. Also referred to as a collateralized fund obligation vehicle.  Stapled transactions  ‚Äî (commonly referred to as \\"stapled secondaries\\") Occurs when a private equity firm (the GP) is raising a new fund. A secondary buyer purchases an interest in an existing fund from a current investor and makes a new commitment to the new fund being raised by the GP. These transactions are often initiated by private equity firms during the fundraising process.\\"Escaping PE Purgatory Through A Secondary Sale.\\" Buyouts, July 7, 2007 They had become less and less frequent during 2008 and 2009 as the appetite for primary investments shrunk. Since 2009, a limited number of spinout transactions have been completed involving captive teams within financial institutions.\\"UK GPs: It‚Äôs spin-out time .\\" PrivateEquity Online, July 15, 2010\\"Lehman to spin out European mezzanine unit.\\" Financial Times, May 10, 2010\\"Fidelity spin-out doubles in size.\\" Financial News, February 23, 2010  Low-Funded Secondary  ‚Äî A secondary transaction where an LP gains liquidity very early in the life of the fund, where the fund has called under 10% of the fund or lessJust closed a new fund and already an investor wants out?! Abe Finkelstein, Vintage, July 23, 2019] ===Sale of direct interests===  Secondary directs or synthetic secondaries  ‚Äì This category is the sale of portfolios of direct investments in operating companies, rather than limited partnership interests in investment funds. These portfolios historically have originated from either corporate development programs or large financial institutions. Typically, this category can be subdivided as follows:  Secondary direct  ‚Äî The sale of a captive portfolio of direct investments to a secondary buyer that will either manage the investments themselves or arrange for a new manager for the investments. One of the most notable examples of a corporate seller engaging into a direct portfolios sale is the two consecutive sales of direct portfolios from AEA Technology to Coller Capital and Vision Capital in 2005 and 2006 respectively.  Synthetic secondary or spinout  ‚Äî Under a synthetic secondary transaction, secondary investors acquire an interest in a new limited partnership that is formed specifically to hold a portfolio of direct investments. Typically the manager of the new fund had historically managed the assets as a captive portfolio. The most notable example of this type of transaction is the spinout of MidOcean Partners from Deutsche Bank in 2003.  Tail-end  ‚Äî This category typically refers to the sale of the remaining assets in a private equity fund that is approaching, or has exceeded, its anticipated life. A tail-end transaction allows the manager of the fund to achieve liquidity for the fund's investors.  Structured secondary  ‚Äì This category typically refers to the structured sale of a portfolio of private equity fund interests whereby the seller keeps some or all of the fund interests on its balance sheet but the buyer agrees to fund all future capital calls of the seller's portfolio in exchange for a preferred return secured against future distributions of the seller's portfolio. These type of secondary transactions have become increasingly explored since mid-2008 and throughout 2009 as many sellers did not want to take a loss through a straight sale of their portfolio at a steep discount but instead were ready to abandon some of the future upside in exchange for a bridge of the uncalled capital commitments. == History Early history=== The Venture Capital Fund of America (today VCFA Group), founded in 1982 by Dayton Carr, was likely the first investment firmContrarian : Second Helping (Dealmaker, 2007) to begin purchasing private equity interests in existing venture capital, leveraged buyout and mezzanine funds, as well as direct secondary interests in private companies.

Dow Jones Private Equity Analyst Guide to the Secondary Market (2007 Edition).A Secondary Market for Private Equity is Born, The Industry Standard, 28 August 2001 Many of the largest financial institutions (e.g., Deutsche Bank, Abbey National, UBS AG) sold portfolios of direct investments and ‚Äúpay-to-play‚Äù funds portfolios that were typically used as a means to gain entry to lucrative leveraged finance and mergers and acquisitions assignments but had created hundreds of millions of dollars of losses. ===2004 to 2007=== The surge in activity in the secondary market, between 2004 and 2007, prompted new entrants to the market. It was during this time that the market evolved from what had previously been a relatively small niche into a functioning and important area of the private equity industry. Prior to 2004, the market was still characterized by limited liquidity and distressed prices with private equity funds trading at significant discounts to fair value.\\"Buyouts Still Dominate Surging Secondaries Market: Some Say Market Is Overcapitalized Fund- of-Join The Game.\\" Buyouts, May 24, 2004 Beginning in 2004 and extending through 2007, the secondary market transformed into a more efficient market in which assets for the first time traded at or above their estimated fair values and liquidity increased dramatically. During these years, the secondary market transitioned from a niche sub-category in which the majority of sellers were distressed to an active market with ample supply of assets and numerous market participants.Private Equity Market Environment: Spring 2004 , Probitas Partners By 2006, active portfolio management had become far more common in the increasingly developed secondary market, and an increasing number of investors had begun to pursue secondary sales to rebalance their private equity portfolios. The continued evolution of the private equity secondary market reflected the maturation and evolution of the larger private equity industry. ===2008 and the credit crisis=== The secondary market for private equity interests has entered a new phase in 2008 with the onset and acceleration of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. Pricing in the market fell steadily throughout 2008 as the supply of interests began to greatly outstrip demand and the outlook for leveraged buyout and other private equity investments worsened. Financial institutions, including Citigroup and ABN AMRO as well as affiliates of AIG and Macquarie were prominent sellers. With the crash in global markets from in the fall of 2008, more sellers entered the market including publicly traded private equity vehicles, endowments, foundations and pension funds. Many sellers were facing significant overcommitments to their private equity programs and in certain cases significant unfunded commitments to new private equity funds were prompting liquidity concerns.Cash panic sweeping VC industry: The capital calls problem VentureBeat, November 7, 2008 With the dramatic increase in the number of distressed sellers entering the market at the same time, the pricing level in the secondary market dropped rapidly. In these transactions, sellers were willing to accept major discounts to current valuations (typically in reference to the previous quarterly net asset value published by the underlying private equity fund manager) as they faced the prospect of further asset write-downs in their existing portfolios or as they had to achieve liquidity under a limited amount of time. At the same time, the outlook for buyers became more uncertain and a number of prominent secondary players were slow to purchase assets. In certain cases, buyers that had agreed to secondary purchases began to exercise material adverse change (MAC) clauses in their contracts to walk away from deals that they had agreed to only weeks before.MAC uncertainty grips sellers in secondary market Private Equity Online, November 3, 2008 Private equity fund managers published their December 2008 valuations with substantial write-downs to reflect the falling value of the underlying companies. As a result, the discount to Net Asset Value offered by buyers to sellers of such assets was reduced. However, activity in the secondary market fell dramatically from 2008 levels as market participants continued to struggle to agree on price. Reflecting the gains in the public equity markets since the end of the first quarter, the dynamics in the secondary market continued to evolve. Certain buyers that had been reluctant to invest earlier in the year began to return and non-traditional investors were more active, particularly for unfunded commitments, than they had been in previous years. === 2010 to 2011 - Post Financial Crisis === Since mid-2010, the secondary market has seen increased levels of activity resulting from improved pricing conditions. Through the middle of 2011, the level of activity has continued to remain at elevated levels as sellers have entered the market with large portfolios, the most attractive funds being transacted at around NAV. As the European sovereign debt crisis hit the financial markets during summer 2011, the Private equity secondary market subsequently saw a decrease both in supply and demand for portfolios of interests in private equity funds, leading to reduced pricing levels compared to pre-summer 2011. However, the volumes on the secondary market were not expected to decrease in 2012 compared to 2011, a record yearSecondary market set to break records, Private Equity Online, February 1, 2012) as, in addition to the banks under pressure from the BASEL III regulations, other institutional investors, including pension funds, Insurances and even Sovereign wealth fund continued to utilize the Private equity secondary market to divest assets.Singapore‚Äôs GIC Said to Offer $700 Million in Buyout-Fund Stakes, Bloomberg, January 20, 2012 In terms of fundraising, secondary investment firms have been the beneficiaries of the gradually improving private equity fundraising market conditions.

Although the number of transactions was roughly the same as in 2013, the average deal size increased 34.6% year over year, reflecting the fact that more multi-hundred million / billion+ dollar transactions were completed in 2014. Indeed, the breadth and number of buyers continues to increase with total volume and activity of small and medium buyers becoming more significant. Large buyers accounted for 59.8% of the market's total volume in 2014, while mid-sized buyers accounted for roughly 34.9% of total volume and small buyers represented roughly 5.3%. Also driving the expansion of the secondary market is the number of buyers expanding their scope of interest into areas in which they were previously inactive. Approximately 31.4% of buyers broadened their secondary focus in 2014 to include buying other alternative investment types (e.g. infrastructure, real estate, portfolios of direct, etc.) ‚Äì an increase of 1.4% from 2013.Setter Capital Volume Report 2014 Setter Capital, JANUARY, 2015 === 2014-2018 === During the four-year period between 2014 and 2018, the secondaries market continued its upward trajectory, approaching $40 billion in transaction volume in the second half of 2017. The figure represents approximately five times total deal activity from 2005 levels. Market watchers attributed the rise to the growing sophistication of secondaries transactions, increased demand for liquidity on the part of institutional investors and a growing number of fund managers using the secondary market to gain access to new streams of capital. The period also gave rise to GP-led restructurings, in which a fund manager leads efforts to restructure the economics of the fund or roll existing fund commitments into a new vehicle. According to Credit Suisse, GP-led secondaries have grown from 10 percent of the market in 2012 to over a third by the end of 2017. Market insiders predict GP-led secondaries to eventually reach 50 percent of market share by the end of 2018, attributing a growing acceptance of their use among marquee private equity firms such as Warburg Pincus and BC Partners as cause for their mainstream acceptance. ===Milestones=== The following is a timeline of some of the most notable secondary transactions and other milestones: 2011 *Coller Capital acquires Cr√©dit Agricole Private Equity (CAPE) and the large majority of the funds CAPE manages. .

Poley Mountain is a known ski resort in southern New Brunswick. The town is centrally located between New Brunswick's three major cities, Moncton, Saint John, and the capital city of Fredericton. Poley Mountain is a popular destination for skiers from the southern portion of New Brunswick and also attracts visitors from Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, particularly over the Christmas and March school breaks. The Poley Mountain Lodge, a New Brunswick icon burnt to the ground Tuesday December 9, 2014. Many were saddened by the news. The mountain has had extensive upgrades over the last decade under the direction of a group of local shareholders who prevented the sale of the mountain's lift system by purchasing the assets of the mountain in the late 1990s. The mountain has been operational every season since the purchase and averages about 100 operating days every season. In the summer‚Äìfall of 2008 the Alpine Lift (fixed grip triple) was installed which gives access to six new beginner and intermediate trails on the west side of the mountain including a new gladed run, Sous-Bois Shediac, created in the fall of 2009. The t-bar lift which used to run parallel to the Chute has been removed and will now become a mogul run for advanced skiers. The addition of the Alpine Lift resulted in Poley becoming the mountain with the greatest uphill capacity in the Maritimes. Poley is often compared to Ski Wentworth near Truro, NS and Crabbe Mountain north of Fredericton, NB as these are the two mountains closest in proximity to Poley. All three ski areas share similar characteristics in terms of skiable terrain and elevation. Currently Poley is exploring the possibility of expanding into summer operations by way of a lift accessed mountain bike park. A feasibility study has been conducted by Gravity Logic of Whistler British Columbia (creators of the Whistler Blackcomb Bike Park) and the board of directors is currently discussing the possibility at length. On December 9, 2014, the iconic main lodge of Poley was burnt to the ground, as fire crews responded to a call at 6:40pm, local time, and were finally able to control the blaze at roughly 10pm local time. Early estimates of the damage reports in the $17 million plus range.

Like many of Miike's works, the film examines the underbelly of respectable Japanese society and the problems of assimilation faced by non- ethnically Japanese people in Japan. The English title refers to ley lines, the paranormal concept of geographic lines of energy based on the placement of landmarks. ==Plot== Ryuichi, his younger brother Shunrei, and their friend Chang are a trio of Japanese youths of Chinese descent who escape their semi- rural upbringing and relocate to Shinjuku, Tokyo. Their wallets are stolen by a Shanghai prostitute nicknamed \\"Killer Pussy\\" so they turn to selling bottles of the recreational inhalant toluene in order to earn money. They later make up with the prostitute, whose real name is Anita, when she quits selling her body after being abused by a client and then her pimp. The three youths buy fake passports and a gun through the black market, intending to stow away on a boat to Brazil. Together with Anita, they rob money from the Chinese crime boss Wong, during which Anita kicks her former pimp. Ikeda and Barbie of the toluene ring ambush them and shoot Chang before the others escape. Triad members arrive and Barbie tells them that Ikeda took the money before they shoot him dead. Chang dies in the car after asking the others to give his share of the money to his mother. Shunrei quickly pedals his bike to the Zhang Fu Diner and gives Chang's mother Chang's share of the money but is caught and run over by Wong's men in a truck on his way back. While Ryuichi and Anita are searching for him, Wong's men spot them and chase them in the truck before smashing into a pile of corrugated metal and dying. Ryuichi and Anita reach the port and give money to the shipowner but discover Wong waiting for them. Anita shoots Wang dead, then Ryuichi and Anita jump into the water and money goes floating everywhere as Wong's men fire repeatedly into the water. Ryuichi and Anita are then shown rowing a boat away, though they are covered in blood, presumably indicating that they are already dead. ==Cast== *Kazuki Kitamura as Ryuichi *Tomorowo Taguchi as Chan *Dan Li as Anita/Chinese prostitute *Naoto Takenaka as Wong *Michisuke Kashiwaya as Shunrei *Samuel Pop Aning as Barbie *Show Aikawa as Ikeda *Far-Long Oh as Anita's pimp *Takeshi Caesar *Yukie Itou *Y≈çzabur≈ç It≈ç as Anita's sadistic client *Ry≈´shi Mizukami *Ren Osugi as Junkyard Owner *Manz≈ç Shinra *Shun Sugata as Cop *K≈çji Tsukamoto as Passport Official *Tetsu Watanabe *Hua Rong Weng ==Release== Ley Lines was released in theatres in Japan on May 22, 1999 in Japan. ==Reception== Sight & Sound found the film to be the \\"most accomplished\\" of Miike's Black Society trilogy, where \\"Miike's stylistic flamboyance is balanced by narrative coherence.\\" The review negatively pointed out that \\"There are moments of sexual horror that play awkwardly for laughs and the immigrant experience isn't explored in great depth, but this is a highly compelling work.\\" Grady Hendrix (The New York Sun), referred to the film as \\"the most technically accomplished of the Black Society Trilogy\\". == References Footnotes=Sources=== * == External links == * Category:Films directed by Takashi Miike Category:Yakuza films Category:Triad films Category:Japanese films Category:Daiei Film films Category:Films about prostitution in Japan Category:Films set in Tokyo ","title":"Ley Lines (film)"},{"id":"9136736","text":"Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom is an animated short film produced by Walt Disney Productions, and originally released to theaters by Buena Vista Film Distribution Company on November 10, 1953. A sequel to the first Adventures in Music cartoon, the 3-D short Melody, Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom is a stylized presentation of the evolution of the four orchestra sections over the ages with: the brass (\\"toot\\"), the woodwind (\\"whistle\\"), the strings (\\"plunk\\"), and the percussion (\\"boom\\"). The first Disney cartoon to be filmed and released in widescreen CinemaScope,*Beck, Jerry (ed.) (1994). The 50 Greatest Cartoons: As Selected by 1,000 Animation Professionals. Atlanta: Turner Publishing. Pg. 130 Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom won the 1954 Oscar for Best Short Subject (Cartoons). In 1994, it was voted #29 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field. This short was the first release by Buena Vista Distribution, a distribution company established by Disney. When Disney's regular distributor RKO Radio Pictures resisted Disney's idea of releasing a feature-length True-Life Adventures nature documentary film, Disney formed his own distribution company to handle future Disney releases.Mosley, Leonard. The Disney Films. Bonanza Books, 1978, pg. 115. == Synopsis == Professor Owl, who rushes to the schoolhouse full of his fine feathered students as a drum roll is played on a snare. A brief musical section introduces us to \\"the subject for today\\": the study of musical instruments. Professor Owl explains to the class (and the viewer) that all music originates from four core sounds: toot (brass), whistle (woodwind), plunk (strings) and boom (percussion). === Toot === The film then jumps to a group of four cavemen, each of whom have discovered the nuclear form of one of the above sounds. We begin with a portly Caveman Toot who has discovered that blowing through an old cow's horn produces a pleasing \\"toot\\". We advance to ancient Egypt in 2000 BC, where Caveman Toot discovers that metal horns produce even better sounds. He celebrates by breaking into a two-note jazz solo as Egyptian characters painted on the walls boogie down. We return to Professor Owl, who explains that making a trumpet longer made its tone lower. We then visit a Roman trumpeter who crashes into a column and bends his horn into a grotesque shape... however, he soon discovers that despite this change in form, the trumpet does not sound any different: it is possible to change the horn's shape without changing the pitch. However, as Professor Owl explains, this horn can only produce certain notes; in order to get all of the notes required for even a simple tune, you would need four horns of different lengths. But if we create a horn with valves, we can effectively have four horns in one, and this fact is celebrated with another jazz solo. === Whistle === We return to the cavemen, where Caveman Whistle is trying to impress his \\"cavegirl\\" by blowing through a tube of grass; he further discovers that adding holes to the tube allows him to modify the \\"whistle\\" in interesting ways (the more holes Whistle adds the longer the grass tube gets and he invents the first flute). The cavegirl is impressed, but then a rival caveman appears, bonks the cavegirl on the head with his club, and drags her off by the hair (which makes Caveman Whistle angry). Professor Owl explains that this system of holes is the basis for every woodwind instrument, including the clarinet played by Johann Sebastian Bach and the saxophone played by a beatnik. === Plunk === Caveman Plunk has discovered that plucking on the string of his bow produces a pleasant \\"plunk\\" sound. An offscreen choir explains (as the animation shows) how to create a simple harp from Caveman Plunk's bow by adding a jar to make a resonator, adding some extra strings, changing the jar to a box of wood, sliding it down and adding tuning pegs, and rearranging it all (and Plunk invents the first harp). Professor Owl mentions that you can either pluck the harp, or play it with a bow. We then briefly visit several periods in history, where we see several stringed instruments being played in similar fashion, and finish with a string quartet, and all of them ending with the strings being broken. === Boom === Caveman Boom hits his stomach to produce a \\"boom\\", and hits other things with his hand and his club to make other sounds. Professor Owl escorts us through history and explains how a variety of percussion instruments emerged from this basic theory, ranging from rattles to complex drum kits and even the bass drums of marching bands. === Conclusion === The chorus recaps that all music, from the trombone to the calliope to the banjo to Latin percussion to \\"music oriental\\" to an orchestra in a concert hall, emerge from the four core sounds with Caveman Toot in the brass section, Caveman Whistle in the woodwind section, Caveman Plunk in the string section and Caveman Boom in the percussion section, all wearing top hats. == Alternate versions == Like many of Disney's early CinemaScope films, a \\"flat\\" version shot in 4:3 ratio was made for theaters that were not equipped for CinemaScope. This required rearranging the artwork for some shots to accommodate the smaller screen. Shots of multiple repeated characters (like the bird chorus at the end, for instance) were cut in half, using two repetitions instead of four. The most notable change comes at the transition from the end of the \\"Boom\\" section to the parade that starts the finale. In the CinemaScope version, the background and characters fade out, leaving the drum in the last scene alone; the drum then jumps from the side of the screen to the centre, and the parade fades in. In the flat version, the camera zooms in on the drum, dissolving into the parade and zooms back out. Other changes occur in the flat version. * Some of the characters like the kitchen bird band members near the beginning and the string quartet members get closer together. * Bach with his clarinet has a book of sheet music with \\"BACH\\" written on it instead of the busts around him. * Plunk morphs into the Egyptian playing the harp instead of fading out to him. * In the CinemaScope version, the grand piano also in the plunk segment stretches but in the flat version, it stays a certain size. == Theatrical release and other releases == The world premiere of Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom was first shown at the Fulton Theatre (now Byham Theater) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on its release day. On March 27th, 1959, American Broadcasting Company's Friday evening program Walt Disney Presents telecast its first television showing of Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom. Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom was reissued in 1963 as a companion short to that year's theatrical re-release of Fantasia. The short is available on two Disney DVD sets: it is a bonus feature on the Fantasia 2000 DVD, and is one of the selected shorts included in the Walt Disney Treasures set Disney Rarities: Celebrated Shorts, 1920s‚Äì1960s. In 1962, Disney issued a re-recorded and expanded version of the short's music and voices on vinyl LP entitled A Child's Introduction to Melody and the Instruments of the Orchestra. Thurl Ravenscroft provided the voice of the owl on the album. While the film was originally released into theatres as a part of a broader collection of shorts, it continues to be used today in music classrooms to provide an elementary understanding of how musical instruments work. ==Voices== * Bill Thompson as Professor Owl / Bertie Birdbrain (uncredited) * Loulie Jean Norman as Penelope Pinfeather (uncredited) * Charlie Parlato as Chorus Singer (uncredited) * Gloria Wood as Suzy Sparrow (uncredited) * The Mellomen as Singing Group (uncredited) ==Reception== Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom won the 1954 Oscar for Best Short Subject (Cartoons). The British Film Institute's magazine Sight & Sound offered it a negative review.

In 1922, he came to Hollywood to put on a knife demonstration for a disbelieving director. He was trusted to throw knives in movies that had to land an inch or two away from a celebrity. He always got right on target, and developed a good reputation for stunts. He was a known scene stealer and was famous for his villainous snarl. He later appeared in such movies as The Most Dangerous Game (1932), playing Tartar, the second henchman of Count Zarrof and played the Witch King in King Kong (1933) and its sequel Son of Kong (1933). After his last movie, Perils of Nyoka (1942), he retired from the acting scene. On May 7, 1950, he died from a cerebral hemorrhage. ==FilmographyActor=== * The Secret Man (1917) ....

The SEC states that Rule 10b5-1 was enacted in order to resolve an unsettled issue over the definition of insider trading, which is prohibited by SEC Rule 10b-5. Different courts of appeals had come to different conclusions about what constituted insider trading under Rule 10b-5 ‚Äî specifically, whether someone could be held liable for insider trading simply by trading while in possession of inside information, or whether a trier of fact must find that the person actually used that inside information when making the trade. == \\"Possession\\" versus \\"use\\" == Paragraph (a) of the Rule essentially repeats the holding of the United States Supreme Court in United States v. O'Hagan,, which defines insider trading under the misappropriation theory. It states, in full, that Paragraph (b) addresses the unsettled \\"possession\\" versus \\"use\\" issue, stating that a person violates Rule 10b-5 simply by trading while in \\"possession\\" of inside information. It states, in full, that In other words, under 10b5-1(b) a person could be liable for insider trading simply by possessing inside information regarding a given security, breaching a fiduciary duty to the source of the information, and then trading it with a self-serving intent, even if he or she would have made the trade anyway. See 'United States v. O'Hagan, 521 U.S. 642, 652 (1997). But it is unlikely the SEC will detect or particularly care about a small trade that would have occurred anyway. A large trade or series of trades that reap unusual benefits for a trader, however, will likely be detected, and it would be difficult to prove that the material non-public information did not contribute to the decision to make the trade. == Affirmative legal defense for planned trades == In paragraph (c), however, the SEC created an affirmative defense to any charge of insider trading, \\"designed to cover situations in which a person can demonstrate that the material nonpublic information was not a factor in the trading decision.\\" The provision allows an affirmative defense to insider trading when the trade was made pursuant to a contract, instructions given to another, or a written plan that \\"[d]id not permit the person to exercise any subsequent influence over how, when, or whether to effect purchases or sales\\" (10b5-1(c)(1)(i)(B)(3)), and where the plan (or contract or instructions) was created before the person had inside information. For example, a CEO of a company could call a broker on January 1 and enter into a plan to sell a particular quantity of shares of his company's stock on March 1, find out terrible news about his company on February 1 that will not become public until April 1, and then go forward with the March 1 sale anyway, saving himself from losing money when the bad news becomes public. Under the terms of Rule 10b5-1(b) this is insider trading because the CEO \\"was aware\\" of the inside information when he made the trade. But he can assert an affirmative defense under Rule 10b5-1(c), because he planned the trade before he learned the inside information. == A possible loophole: canceling plans == After Rule 10b5-1 was enacted, the SEC staff publicly took the position that canceling a planned trade made under the safe harbor does not constitute insider trading, even if the person was aware of the inside information when canceling the trade. The SEC stated that, despite the fact that 10b5-1(c) requires trades to be irrevocable, there can be no liability for insider trading under Rule 10b-5 without an actual securities transaction, based on the U.S. Supreme Court's holding in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723 (1975). This staff interpretation raises the possibility that executives can exploit this safe harbor by entering into 10b5-1 trading plans before they have inside information while retaining the option to later cancel those plans based on inside information. Although paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) does deny the affirmative defense to offsetting or hedged transactions, in that case there would still be an actual trade (whichever of the offsetting trades was not canceled) that could constitute insider trading and violate Rule 10b-5. The SEC's position is that there can be no insider trading without a trade, so that a person could cancel a planned trade based on inside information and avoid liability. Although technically any plan that is cancelable does not come under the 10b5-1 safe harbor, proving that an executed trade was hypothetically cancelable might be very difficult. A few academic commentators have written about this issue, arguing that insiders can make systematically above-market profits by using 10b5-1 plans that they are still able to cancel. One empirical study has found that insiders using 10b5-1 plans do in fact make above-market profits (the paper also alludes to other potential loopholes that might explain this result), and another has found that the presence of publicly announced 10b5-1 plans has economic effects on securities markets that are generally associated with insider trading. Others contend that rather than timing trades, executives may time news or press releases to move the stock before a 10b5-1 plan sale. == SEC reaction == Noted in a speech by Linda Chatman Thomsen, the SEC chief enforcement officer, the SEC is now investigating why 10b5-1 trades appear to outperform the market. Allegations of improper 10b5-1 trades were noted during the insider trading trial of Joseph Nacchio, former Qwest CEO. There are also preliminary investigations into 10b5-1 trades by Angelo Mozilo from Countrywide Financial. The SEC sent a Wells Notice to Mozilo in May 2009, suggesting intent to pursue civil charges in relation to alleged illegal trades through his 10b5-1 plan. On March 25, 2009, the SEC staff revised its interpretative guidance regarding the circumstances under which the affirmative defense in Rule 10b5-1(c) is available. In particular, the staff followed the approach previously urged by some commentators to clarify (1) that the cancellation of a 10b5-1 plan could call the good faith of other, executed plans into doubt and (2) that the Supreme Court's decision in Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.S. 723 (1975), did not affect the SEC's ability to bring an enforcement action against a would-be insider trader who canceled a trading plan and did not trade in a particular transaction because a subsequent decision, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., v. Dabit, 547 U.S. 71 (2006), made clear that Blue Chip Stamps dealt only with the implied private right of action for violations of Rule 10b-5 and not the \\"in connection with\\" requirement for all Rule 10b-5 violations. ==References== Rule 10b5-1 Rule 10b5-1 ","title":"SEC Rule 10b5-1"},{"id":"9136970","text":"Langhorne may refer to: == Places == * Langhorne, Pennsylvania ** Langhorne Speedway ** Langhorne (SEPTA station) * Langhorne Manor, Pennsylvania, borough in Bucks County, Pennsylvania * Langhorne Creek, South Australia == People == * Nancy Witcher Langhorne, bka Nancy Astor (1879‚Äì1964), American-born first woman British MP * Langhorne Bond (born 1937), U.S. federal administrator * Langhorne Slim (born 1980), American country singer * Algernon Philip Yorke Langhorne (1882‚Äì1945), Major-General in the British Army * Bruce Langhorne (1938‚Äì2017), American folk musician * Cary DeVall Langhorne (1873‚Äì1948), American Medal of Honor recipient * Crystal Langhorne (born 1986), American basketball player * Francis Harold Langhorne (1892‚Äì1918), Lieutenant in the 2nd Canadian Mounted Rifles killed in action at Cambrai * Harold Stephen Langhorne (1866‚Äì1932), Brigadier-General in the British Army in the First World War * James Archibald Dunboyne Langhorne (1878‚Äì1950), Brigadier in the British Army * Jeremiah Langhorne (died 1742), prominent landowner and jurist in colonial Pennsylvania * John Langhorne (poet) (1735‚Äì1779), English poet and clergyman * John Langhorne (1805‚Äì1881), mathematics master of Giggleswick School * John Langhorne (1862‚Äì1925), master of Loretto School and headmaster of the Dean Orphanage Charity School later known as the John Watson's Institution in Edinburgh * Reverend John Langhorne (1836‚Äì1911), master of Tonbridge School and headmaster of The King's School, Rochester * Michael Langhorne Astor (1916‚Äì1980), British politician * Reggie Langhorne (born 1963), American football player * Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835‚Äì1910), author, pen name Mark Twain * Reverend Thomas Langhorne (born 1797), founder of Loretto School * Sir William Langhorne, 1st Baronet (c. 1631‚Äì1715), merchant, landowner and Governor of Madras ","title":"Langhorne"},{"id":"9136992","text":"Skanky Possum was a twice-a-year poetry journal and small book-publishing imprint begun in Austin, Texas and associated with a long-running, home-based poetry reading series.

The term was first defined and used by Frank Fitch Grout during the early 1900s in describing the Duluth gabbro complex in northern Minnesota and adjacent Ontario. Lopoliths typically consist of large layered intrusions that range in age from Archean to Eocene. Examples include the Duluth gabbro, the Sudbury Igneous Complex of Ontario, the Bushveld igneous complex of South Africa, the Great Dyke in Zimbabwe, the Skaergaard complex of Greenland and the Humboldt lopolith of Nevada.

It was built in 1806 and is one of the oldest schools in Canada. The school's bicentennial in 2006 attracted over 1500 former students back to the school. ==History== Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School was founded in 1806 by John Strachan as the Cornwall Grammar School. Strachan would later go on to help found the University of Toronto. Over the years, the school has been through several structural changes, such as when the 1944 Cornwall‚ÄìMassena earthquake destroyed the middle of the building which then had to be demolished and reconstructed. In the mid-1970s, the centre core again underwent major renovations. Additional changes were made during the summer months of 2011 and 2012 to help accommodate the students from General Vanier Intermediate School for the 2011‚Äì12 school year, and later to assist with the transition of the Kinsmen-Vincent Massey school for the 2012‚Äì13 school year. In a 2002 controversial decision, the school's grade 9 and 10 students were moved to St. Lawrence and General Vanier, while grade 11 and 12 students from those schools were subsequently moved to CCVS in an effort to cut costs. This was changed back in 2010, which resulted in CCVS becoming a 7‚Äì12 school following the General Vanier Intermediate School closure at the conclusion of the 2010‚Äì11 school year. Today, CCVS is an ethnically diverse school which reflects the changing demographics in the city of Cornwall. Due to its long history, CCVS offers many scholarship, bursary and award opportunities that total more than $150,000 for its graduating students. Notable among these is the Arthur F. Battista memorial bursary. It is awarded to 30 graduates each year, 15 to college bound students and 15 to university bound students. The bursary awards the university bound students with $4,000 over two years, and $3,500 to college bound students. Currently, CCVS offers Special High Skills Majors in Arts and Culture and Communication and Technology. Students can earn a red seal on their diploma if they successfully complete a certain number of credits in these areas of study. ==See also== *List of high schools in Ontario ==References== Category:High schools in Cornwall, Ontario Category:Educational institutions established in 1806 ","title":"Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School"},{"id":"9137070","text":"Flavia de Oliveira (born 17 July 1983 in Londrina, BrazilRetrieved 31 July 2020.) is a Brazilian fashion model who participated in the 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011 Victoria's Secret Fashion Shows.

Scott appeared on a number of occasions for the Second XIs of Middlesex and Glamorgan between 1977 and 1980 before moving to Worcestershire, for whom he made his first-class debut in June 1981 against Surrey at The Oval. Opening the batting, Scott made 46 and 52, and retained his place for much of the rest of the season thanks to some solid scores including what was to prove his only first-class century, 109 against Gloucestershire in mid- July. He finished the 1981 season with 968 first-class runs at 26.08, including that hundred and six further half-centuries though his one-day form was less impressive as his top score was only 42. Scott began the 1982 season fairly well established in the Worcestershire side, but a succession of low scores saw him play only occasionally from mid-season onwards. In 1983 he forced his way back into the first team, but again did poorly, making a pair against Nottinghamshire in July in what turned out to be his penultimate first-class match (he made 23 and 21 in his last, against Essex in late August). Scott left Worcestershire for Sussex in 1984, and remained for 1985 as well, but never played a first-team game for that county and after a year out of county cricket he returned to New Road in 1987 to begin an unusual final chapter of his Worcestershire career. He never played first-team cricket for the county again, but for six seasons he captained the Second XI, often coming in at the bottom of the order despite his batting ability. Against Hampshire II in 1991 he made 2 from number 11 in the first innings, then when Worcestershire followed on he opened the batting and hit 181! He amassed 61 not outs from 94 innings during these years in the seconds. In 1993 Scott was part of the victorious Old Hill team which beat local rivals West Bromwich Dartmouth in the final of the Abbot Ale National Club Championship at Lord's, and six years later he made one final List A appearance for the Worcestershire Cricket Board XI against Hampshire Cricket Board in the NatWest Trophy. Scott is one of very few Level 4 cricket coaches in the world and is now coaching the Gresham's School First XI cricket team in Holt, a small town in Norfolk, England. He took the First XI on a tour to Barbados (#YOBO) for their pre- season in his first week with the team and that turned out to be a successful tour, in which Frankie Sutton failed to score a 100. ==External links== * * Statistical summary from CricketArchive Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:English cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:Worcestershire Cricket Board cricketers ","title":"Mark Scott (cricketer)"},{"id":"9137081","text":"Jean-Pierre Charbonneau in 2010 Jean-Pierre Charbonneau (born January 3, 1950 in Saint-Eustache, Quebec) is a journalist and a former Quebec politician. He was the Quebec MNA member under the Parti Qu√©b√©cois for the provincial ridings of Borduas and Verch√®res in the Mont√©r√©gie region. ==Life and career== After studying at Montreal's Ahuntsic College in social sciences, Charbonneau attended the Universit√© de Montr√©al in criminology and obtained a bachelor's degree in 1972. He later had a lengthy journalistic career in which he worked for several media outlets in the Montreal region including radio stations CKAC and CKVL, newspapers including Le Devoir and La Presse and various magazines and revues. He was mostly a journalist and specialist in crime news. He also published several books related to organized crime which gave him an award. On May 1, 1973, Antonio Mucci, a Montreal Mafia member, fired three times at him in the offices of Le Devoir. One shot hit him in the arm. He was back at work two months later. Charbonneau first entered politics in 1976 when he was elected in Vercheres and the Parti Qu√©b√©cois, led by Ren√© L√©vesque defeated Robert Bourassa's Liberals during that election. He was a prominent figure in attracting supporters of sovereignty during the 1980 referendum which resulted in a victory for the No side. He was re-elected in 1981 and 1985 before stepping down the first time in 1989 prior to a humanitarian trip to Africa organized by the Universit√© de Montr√©al and the criminology faculty. He was not named as a minister during his first 13 years but was the parliamentary secretary to L√©vesque in 1983 and 1984 and headed several committees. He was also briefly an administration member of Oxfam-Quebec, an NGO concentrating in international development and aid. He also taught Tai chi in his area for five years and returned to co-host a radio show on CHKL. While being away from politics he participated in Belanger-Campeau Committee which was launched by the Bourassa government in the fallout of the failure of the Meech Lake Accord which would have accorded Quebec a distinct society mention. Charbonneau re- entered politics in 1994 where he was elected as an MNA for the riding of Borduas when the Parti Qu√©b√©cois under the leadership of Jacques Parizeau, defeated the Liberals led by Daniel Johnson, Jr. He was re-elected successfully in 1998 and 2003. He was the speaker of the provincial legislative assembly of Quebec for six years, from 1996 to 2002, before being named the Deputy Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs in the Bernard Landry cabinet, until the party's defeat to Jean Charest's Liberals in the 2003 elections. He served as critic of the opposition party in public safety and health until his second retirement on November 15, 2006. At one time Charbonneau was the minister for reform of democratic institutions under the PQ government. He later became president of the Mouvement d√©mocratie nouvelle, which advocates proportional representation in Quebec. ==References== ==External links== *Biography of Jean-Pierre Charbonneau (English) * Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:French Quebecers Category:Journalists from Quebec Category:Organized crime writers Category:Parti Qu√©b√©cois MNAs Category:Universit√© de Montr√©al alumni Category:People from Saint-Eustache, Quebec Category:Presidents of the National Assembly of Quebec Category:21st-century Canadian politicians ","title":"Jean-Pierre Charbonneau"},{"id":"9137093","text":"The Priestess (Armenian: ’î÷Ä’¥’∏÷Ç’∞’´’∂ Qrmuhin) written by Chaldranian and renowned Armenian screenwriter Anahit Aghasaryan, draws inspiration from \\"an anonymous woman\\" recorded in the mysterious Fourth Century manuscript 'The History\\" by Armenian historian Agathangelos.\\"The Priestess\\" Movie from Armenia Receives Royal Post-Production Treatment for Hollywood Debut The film is set in Armenia, in present-day Yerevan, with scenes to the ancient past, circa 301 AD, a time when pagan gods and priestesses ruled the nation.

Besides fronting a number of his own bands, (Velvet Monkeys, B.A.L.L., and Gumball) Fleming has produced Sonic Youth, Screaming Trees, Teenage Fanclub and Hole. ==CareerBands=== The Stroke Band Fleming started his musical career with the art/garage/punk group The Stroke Band of Adel, Georgia in the late 1970s. They released one album, Green and Yellow, in 1978 on Abacus Records. Citizen 23 After The Stroke Band, Don relocated to Norfolk, Va. in 1979 and formed the punkish/new wave group Citizen 23 with Elaine Barnes, Mark Myers, and, Stephen Soles. Their only recorded output was on the compilation album No Room to Dance in 1980. The Velvet Monkeys Citizen 23 broke up in early 1981; all members but Mark Mayers relocated to Washington, D.C. shortly thereafter and formed the three-piece psychedelic/post-punk band The Velvet Monkeys in the fall of 1981. The Velvet Monkeys line-up featured Fleming on guitar & vocals, Barnes on keyboards and vocals, Stephen Soles on bass, and a drum machine called Dr. Rhythm providing the beat. The Velvet Monkeys would go through many incarnations over the next 10 years, with Fleming the constant factor in all versions. In July 1982 the band released their debut -- Everything is Right‚Äîon cassette tape. This album was re-released on CD in 2011. After trading in their drum machine for a live drummer (Jay \\"The Rummager\\" Spiegel) in 1981 and switching to a new bass player (Charles Steck) in early 1982, the band began to grow their following through increased gigging in the Washington, DC area and the Eastern Seaboard. This lineup released the album Future on Fountain of Youth Records in 1983. In 1985, ousting all but Spiegel and himself, Fleming brought on guitarist & keyboardist Malcolm Riviera of D.C.'s Grand Mal. The band released the single \\"Spooky\\" on Go Records in spring 1985.. Guitarist Stuart Casson, formerly of D.C.'s punk group Dove, was added as the fourth member in the fall. This lineup released the single \\"Colors (Part I&II;)\\" on Bona Fide Records that summer. In 1986, Casson left the band and Tom Kane joined as bassist. The band recorded a demo with Kane but it was not released. Kane was then replaced by bassist & vocalist Rob Kennedy, formerly of D.C.'s The Chumps and NYC's The Workdogs. The band did a three-week U.S. Tour with Half Japanese in the summer of 1986. Big Big Sun, a cassette of live recordings of both bands from that tour was released on K Records in fall 1986. In 1987, Spiegel left the band and was replaced by drummer Scott Jarvis, formerly of N.C.'s Th' Cigaretz and NYC's The Workdogs (in which he had played with Kennedy). This lineup played recorded a session at Jag Studios in Raleigh, N.C., but the recordings were not released until 1998's Houseparty CD, a compilation of various unreleased Velvet Monkeys tracks. By 1988, Fleming and Spiegel had re-located to New York City where they teamed up with former Shockabilly bass player and Shimmy Disc impresario Mark Kramer and drummer David Licht to form B.A.L.L.. After that group's acrimonious demise, the trio of Fleming, Riviera and Spiegel reunited to form the next iteration of the Velvet Monkeys. Fleming expanded the band with such indie celebrities as John Hammill of Pussy Galore, Thurston Moore, J Mascis, and Julia Cafritz. This supergroup recorded the band's final album, a soundtrack parody called Rake that paid tribute to the 1970s Blaxploitation film Shaft. The band has never officially broken up, and Fleming continues to revive the group when the time is right. Dinosaur Jr. After Fleming and Spiegel's group B.A.L.L. broke up in 1990, the duo briefly joined Dinosaur Jr. and released \\"The Wagon\\" 45 on the Sub Pop label. The two left Dinosaur Jr. shortly after the release of the single. Gumball In 1990 Jay Spiegel approached his friend Eric Vermillion, a member of Camp Hill, PA's The Stump Wizards, about playing with himself and Fleming. Vermilion agreed and subsequently quit The Stump Wizards. After less than a week's rehearsal, the new trio played its first show and Gumball was born. Their first release came our shortly thereafter: an eponymous 12 inch EP on Paperhouse Records/Sire Records in England. In 1991 the band released the album Special Kiss, also on Paperhouse, and embarked on a tour with Mudhoney, Sonic Youth, and other similar American indie bands of the early 1990s. In 1991, Gumball signed a two-album deal with Columbia Records and re-entered the studio to record their major-label debut, Super Tasty. The sessions were done in Wisconsin with producer Butch Vig (who later engineered Nirvana's major label debut Nevermind). Although Gumball recorded Super Tasty as a trio, fourth member (and longtime musical associate) Malcolm Riviera joined the band shortly after the album's release, and in 1993 the foursome toured the U.S., Europe, and Japan in support of the album. Gumball released their second album for Columbia, Revolution on Ice, in 1994 and toured in support of it throughout that year. The band left Columbia in 1994 and released the live album Tokyo Encore on their own label. By early 1995 the band called it quits rather than shopping for another label. Other Bands Fleming was also a member of the bands Dim Stars, Death Camp 2000, Half Japanese, Tabby Chinos, Idlewild, and Gravy. He has also made many guest appearance both live and in the studio with Brain Surgeons, Shotgun Rationale, Jad Fair, Los Straitjackets, Maureen Tucker, Steroid Maximus (Foetus), Tinklers, and Walking Seeds. ===Solo Work=== Don has released recordings on his personal label Instant Mayhem and on several other labels: Don Fleming 4 (a four-song EP with Fleming and artists Kim Gordon, Julia Cafritz and R. Stevie Moore); Super Bad @ 65 (compilation album released by Zero Hour records); the solo EP jojo ASS RUNne; Because Tomorrow Comes, a solo CD-3; the track \\"Adam's Fall\\" on compilation album 78 LTD (Thick Syrup Records); Telstar, featuring Thurston Moore & Fleming; the song \\"Sound as Steel\\" on the Guitarrorists CD (No. 6 Records); and the solo single \\"Real Cool Time\\" (Iridescence Records). ===Music Projects=== Don has played in and on many music projects throughout his career: Foot with Thurston Moore and Jimbo (aka Jim Dunbar); The Walter Sears with Tom Smith, Thurston Moore, Steve Shelley, Sean Lennon, Jim Dunbar and Rat Bastard; The Backbeat Band (a supergroup that recorded all the music for the film Backbeat, which focuses on The Beatles' early career); The Dripping Tap, a collaboration with R.

He is sometimes simply called the Scepsian (Strab. ix. pp. 438, 439, x. pp. 456, 472, 473, 489), and sometimes simply Demetrius (Strab. xii. pp. 551, 552, xiii. pp. 596, 600, 602).

The Annual of the British School at Athens, 22, pp 23-47. doi:10.1017/S0068245400009837. He was the author of a very extensive work which is very often referred to, and bore the title . It consisted of at least twenty-six books (Strab. xiii. p. 603 and passim; Athen. iii. pp. 80, 91; Steph. Byz. s.v. ). This work was an historical and geographical commentary on that part of the second book of the Iliad in which the forces of the Trojans are enumerated, known as the Trojan Battle Order or Trojan Catalogue (compare Harpocrat. s. vv. , ; Schol. ad Apollon. Rhod. i. 1123, 1165). The numerous other passages in which Demetrius of Scepsis is mentioned or quoted, are collected by Westermann on Vossius, De Hist. Graec., p. 179, &c.; Demetrius's work has been used by several ancient authors as important source for the Troad region. Among these authors is Strabo in Book 13 of his Geographica. Some of the fragments are also quoted by Athenaeus in his Deipnosophistae.https://hestieia.wordpress.com/biographical-details-about- demetrios/ Travelling with Demetrios of Skepsis ==References== * Category:Ancient Greek grammarians ","title":"Demetrius of Scepsis"},{"id":"9137259","text":"Private protected areas of India refer to protected areas inside India whose land rights are owned by an individual or a corporation / organization, and where the habitat and resident species are offered some kind of protection from exploitative activities like hunting, logging, etc. The Government of India did not provide any legal or physical protection to such entities, but in an important amendment introduced by the Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Act of 2002, has agreed to protect communally owned areas of ecological value. ==Private ownership== In pre-British India, and erstwhile British India and associated suzerainties, large tracts of wilderness were under private ownership, typically under the ownership of the royal families of the suzerainties. Animals and habitat in these tracts were protected by royal decree and royal forces. Later, after the advent of the British, these lands were protected by personal guards of the royal families. However, these lands were usually used as hunting grounds for the maharajahs and other noble families, so while the animals and habitat were accorded protection from external entities, hunting for sport by the owners of the land was commonly practised. Even so, some of such hunting was done on a sustainable basis, and some wildlife like the Asiatic cheetah were trained to hunt in such hunting grounds. After independence, the political integration of India caused most of the royal families to lose their ownership rights to these lands, and these were converted into reserved forests, wildlife sanctuaries and national parks. Some of India's most famous protected areas had their origins in privately owned protected lands. Some of these are listed below. ===From the Northern princely states=== *Dachigam National Park - Once the private hunting preserve of the Maharaja of Kashmir Hari Singh, it was declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1951 after the accession of Kashmir, and was designated a national park in 1981. ===From the Western princely states=== *Gir National Park - These were the private hunting grounds of the Nawab of Junagadh, who by royal decree banned the hunting of the increasingly rare Asiatic lion in 1900. It was only in 1966 that the region was protected as the Gir Forest Area, and the region received national park status in 1975 *Ranthambhore National Park - The area around the Ranthambhore Fort were the private hunting grounds of Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II of Jaipur. After integration with India, the Government of India declared the region Sawai Madhopur Game Sanctuary in 1955, making it a Project Tiger reserve in 1973, and a national park in 1980 *Keoladeo National Park - These were the private hunting grounds of Maharaja Brijendra Singh of Bharatpur. Upon joining the Union of India, the maharaja kept his hunting privileges at the grounds until 1971, when it was declared a wildlife sanctuary. It was upgraded to the status of a national park in 1982. *Sariska National Park - Sariska was the private hunting grounds of Maharaja Jai Singh of Alwar. It was given the status of a reserved forest in 1955 and became a wildlife sanctuary in 1958, before becoming a national park in 1992. *Darrah National Park - These were the hunting grounds of the Maharaja of Kota, and were declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1955 after the merger of Kota with India, and combined with two other sanctuaries a national park in 2004. ===From the Central princely states=== *Bandhavgarh National Park - The area around the overgrown Bandhavgarh Fort were the hunting grounds of the Maharaja of Rewa. After the union of Rewa with India, the maharaja still retained hunting rights to the area until 1968, when the Maharaja handed over the hunting grounds (with the exception of the fort) to be declared a national park. A special permit is still required to visit the fort. *Madhav National Park - The area around Shivpuri were the private hunting grounds of the Scindia royal family of Gwalior. Upon accession to India, the grounds were designated to be Madhya Bharat National Park (1959), later being renamed to Shivpuri National Park and finally to Madhav National Park. ===From the Southern princely states=== *Periyar National Park - The region around the Periyar lake was fashioned as a private game sanctuary by the maharaja of Travancore to stop the encroachment of tea plantations. Founded as Nellikkampatty Game Sanctuary in 1934, it was consolidated as a wildlife sanctuary in 1950 after the political integration of India, and designated as a national park in 1982. *Bandipur National Park - These were private hunting grounds of the Maharaja of Mysore. In 1930, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV declared Bandipur a game reserve of 80 km2, and in 1941 expanded it to 800 km2, reinventing it as Venugopala Wildlife Park. After the Kingdom of Mysore joined India, the park was made a Project Tiger reserve in 1973, and a national park in 1985. *Nagarhole National Park - The park area and its surrounding regions were the hunting grounds of the Maharaja of Mysore. After the merger of Mysore with India, Nagarhole first became a wildlife sanctuary in 1955, and later became a national park in 1988. *Mahavir Harina Vanasthali National Park - This region was the private hunting ground of the Nizam of Hyderabad. After the annexure of Hyderabad in 1956, it was wildlife sanctuary in 1975, and a national park in 1994. Among the other former hunting grounds of the Nizam of Hyderabad (once one of the richest persons in the world) are the Pocharam Wildlife Sanctuary and the Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam Wildlife Sanctuary. Ranganthittu Bird Sanctuary was also privately owned by the Maharaja of Mysore before he was persuaded by Salim Ali to declare it a wildlife sanctuary in 1940. ===From the Eastern princely states=== *Simlipal National Park - Initially a hunting ground for the Maharajas of Mayurbhanj. After the merger of Mayurbhanj with India in 1949, it became a reserved forest in 1956. It then became a tiger reserve (1973), wildlife sanctuary (1979), national park (1980) and finally a biosphere reserve (1994). *Manas National Park - The area was initially the hunting grounds of the Maharaja of Cooch Behar and the Raja of Gauripur. It was declared a protected area - Manas Sanctuary, as early as 1928, but the hunting rights of the royal families were not revoked. The sanctuary finally turned fully protected when it became a tiger reserve in 1973, and a national park in 1990. However, royal families were allowed to keep personal land holdings below a certain threshold area, and hence some small scale privately held protected areas still exist in India. ==Non-profit ownership== The biggest non-profit private organization which acquires wilderness tracts for development into private protected areas, the Nature Conservancy - does not operate in India, but has shown interest in expanding its operations to the country. The World Land Trust, another non-profit organization, in partnership with the Wildlife Trust of India has funded two significant privately owned protected land holdings in India. The purpose of the holdings are to provide migration corridors to herds of Indian elephants,and the corresponding project is called the Wild Lands Corridor. The two corridors are: * The Siju-Rewak corridor in the Garo Hills in the state of Meghalaya, for connection between the Siju Wildlife Sanctuary and the Rewak Reserved Forest. This is one of only four forded corridors across the Simsang River, which bisects the Garo Hills. This region also contains large omnivores and carnivores like the Bengal tiger, clouded leopard and the Himalayan black bear. * The Tirunelli-Kudrakote corridor in the state of Kerala between the Tirunelli Reserved Forest and the Kudrakote Reserved Forest acts as a migration corridor for India's largest extant elephant population. The region is part of the Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot which is home to the Nilgiri tahr, Salim Ali's fruit bat and 13 endemic bird species including the Malabar parakeet. The trust is in the process of reallocation of villages in the corridor, and is planning to register the corridor as a reserved forest once reallocation is complete, so that standard government protection is obtained.Site for the Wild lands corridor, World Land Trust website The introduction of the protected area category community reserves under the Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Act of 2002 has introduced legislation for providing government protection to community held lands, which could be used for obtaining state protection in non-profit privately held lands of ecological value.

Founding mainstays are Becky Thomas (a.k.a. Beki Thomas, Beki Colada) on vocals and keyboards, her brother Matt Thomas on guitar and vocals (a.k.a. Matt Doll) and Andrea Vendy on drums. They were joined by Nick Gill (a.k.a. Nik Daniel) on guitar in 1990, and Josh Alexander on bass guitar in 1994. They released three studio album: Venus Returning (July 1996), Pink Pills (April 1998) ‚Äì which reached No. 12 on the ARIA Albums Chart ‚Äì and Rapture (March 2003). Their synth-driven single, \\"Cry\\" (January 1998), peaked at No. 13 on the ARIA Singles Charts and was listed on the Triple J Hottest 100 for 1998. The band also performed the song on Hey Hey It's Saturday. They disbanded in December 2001 after a farewell tour of Australia after that they had to sing a song for their fans. ==History== The Mavis's were formed as a four-piece post- punk, rock band in Ballarat in 1987 by Katherine McNulty on bass guitar; Becky Thomas (a.k.a. Beki Thomas, Beki Colada) on lead vocals, keyboards, Farfisa, percussion and melodica; her brother, Matt Thomas (a.k.a. Matt Doll) on guitar, vocals, sitar, Indian banjo, Farfisa, Harmonium, percussion, keyboards and sound FX; and Andrea Vendy on drums, percussion, bells and djembe. Andrew Craw soon joined on guitar for live performances. Matt described forming the band as \\"a way to get away from Ballarat\\". They were named after a cat, Mavis, that they saw while jamming in a friend's basement. Their first gig was in a church hall with a four-song set list. In 1990 the band relocated to Melbourne and Craw was replaced on guitar by Nick Gill (a.k.a. Nik Daniel). They released their debut single, a 7\\" double A-side of \\"Rollercoaster\\" and \\"Witch Hunt\\", in the following year on the Giggle label. Note: User may have to click \\"Search again\\" and provide details at \\"Enter a title:\\" e.g. Rollercoaster; or at \\"Performer:\\" Maviss In early 1993 they released their first extended play, Spindrift, via the Slipped Discs label and Mushroom Distribution Service (MDS). Its five tracks were recorded by Dave Nelson and mixed and produced by Nelson with Paul Barker. Cameron Adams of Beat Magazine described it in February 1993 as \\"Recorded live at The Empress ‚Äì and sounding all the better for it ‚Äì The Mavis's make pop which is edgy and ace fun. From the rollicking 'Spinning Top' to the very cool 'Bless My Soul' it is a fine EP. Best of all is the opener 'Juggernaut', all harmony and melody.\\" A second EP, Poseidon, was released in May 1994, on MDS. The six-track work was recorded by the line up of Becky and Matt Thomas, Gill, Urquhart and Vendy; with Laurence Maddy producing. Jeff Jenkins of In Press Magazine described it, \\"This is pop that also rocks. It's dreamy, but it also knows when to poke you in the chest. These guys are great.\\" X-Press Magazines Lucy Morris felt that it \\"contains six refreshingly exciting, highly addictive, punchy pop songs which should at least earn them the tag of 'a band to look out for'. This is simply one of the best Australian releases for ages. It's the perfect marriage of post punk artiness and classic pop melodies with bucket-loads of energy to boot.\\" By the time the EP appeared, Josh Alexander had joined on bass guitar. Their popularity grew and they signed with Mushroom Records' White Records label in 1995, which issued their second single, \\"Moon Drone Gold\\", in December. The Mavis's released their debut album, Venus Returning, in May 1996, which was produced by Kalju Tonuma (Nick Barker). Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described how it \\"highlighted the band's brash sound, which mixed the Thomas siblings' idiosyncratic, imperfect vocal blend, crashing guitars, sugar-frosted melodies, goofy keyboard embellishments and odd instrumentation (sitar, Tibetan bells and Indian banjo).\\" It provided three singles, \\"Thunder\\" (March 1996), \\"Box\\" (August) and \\"Lost\\" (November). \\"Thunder\\" was listed on the national youth radio Triple J audience poll, Hottest 100 of 1996, at No. 92. They toured with Sydney-based pop group, Def FX. The band's next single, \\"Naughty Boy\\", was released in August 1997, which McFarlane felt was \\"raunchy\\" and an \\"aggressive rock\\" effort. It was listed on the Triple J Hottest 100, 1997 at No. 37 ‚Äì their highest ever placement. It was used in a Just Jeans ad. In April 1998 they released their second studio album, Pink Pills, which reached No. 12 on the ARIA Albums Chart.Australian (ARIA) chart peaks: *Top 50 peaks: *Top 100 peaks to December 2010: It was also produced by Tonuma for White Records. McFarlane declared that the album was \\"critically acclaimed\\" and \\"was a more diverse and ambitious release than the debut.\\" The second single from the album, \\"Cry\\" (January 1998), reached No. 13 on the ARIA Singles Chart. McFarlane opined that it was \\"infectious... glistening synth- pop... ABBA meets ELO.\\" The track was listed at No. 61 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 1998. They performed the song live on Hey Hey It's Saturday. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1998 the Mavis's received four nominations: Best Pop Release for Pink Pills and Best Cover Art for Dominic O'Brien, Matt Thomas, Rachel Boyce and Alison Smith work, Single of the Year and Song of the Year for \\"Cry\\". At the 1999 awards ceremony, their single \\"Puberty Song\\" (November 1998) earned Tonuma a nomination for Engineer of the Year ‚Äì together with his work on 28 Days' album Kid Indestructible and Felicity Hunter's \\"Hardcore Adore\\". After the album's release, the band toured in support of Kylie Minogue, and later that year they backed United States group, Green Day, on their Australian tour. The band contributed a cover version of the Burt Bacharach and Hal David song, \\"Walk on By\\", for the various Australian artists' tribute album, To Hal and Bacharach (April 1998), on WEA. This was followed by a cover of the Duran Duran song, \\"Planet Earth\\", which was featured on another tribute album, Undone: The Songs of Duran Duran in October 1999. In 2000 they contributed a cover of the ABBA song \\"Bang-A-Boomerang\\" to the soundtrack to the comedy film, The Wog Boy. In February 2000, they released the single, \\"Happiness\\", which appeared on a television advertisement for Australian Hyundai Motor Company. The company's original slogan was \\"Hyundai is happiness\\". The Mavis's also provided music for a Coca-Cola ad. This was followed in May by another cover, this time of Jim Keays' \\"The Boy from the Stars\\", which was included in the soundtrack to the film, Sample People (2000). They recorded material for a third album, Rapture, with Tonuma producing, but it was not released until March 2003 because of problems between the group and their label. The second single from the album, \\"Coming Home\\", was released in May. From July to August 2001 the group provided a farewell tour of Australia and performed tracks from the album, before disbanding in December. They issued a compilation album, Throwing Little Stones, in October 2002. After their split, Becky Thomas, Nick Gill and Josh Alexander formed Junkatique, and later, Beki and the Bullets with Beki Thomas and Nick Gill. Matt Thomas performed as Matt Doll and fronted electro-pop bands, The Blow Waves and Video Video, with Byron St John and Matthew Sigley. In February 2013 siblings, Beki and Matt re-united to perform some material by the Mavis's, and to record a six-track EP, Searching for Zero (March 2013). On 27 December 2014 the Mavis's reformed, with original members Beki, Matt and Nik joined by additional musicians, for a one-off show in Melbourne. Alexander and Vendy were unavailable. In 2018, the band reunited once again to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Pink Pills. The Thomas siblings and Gill performed the album in its entirety for the tour. ==DiscographyStudio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\" Details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"1\\" Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;AUS - ! scope=\\"row\\" Venus Returning  * Released: May 1996 * Label: White, Mushroom (D24542) * Format: CD  76 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Pink Pills  * Released: April 1998 * Label: White, Mushroom (MUSH33077.2) * Format: CD  12 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Rapture  * Released: March 2003 * Label: Mushroom (MUSH332892) * Format: CD  ‚Äî } ===Compilation albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\" Details - ! scope=\\"row\\" Throwing Little Stones  *Released: 28 October 2002 *Label: Mushroom (MUSH33587.2) *Format: CD - ! scope=\\"row\\" Kids in the Basement: Volume One  *Released: 2011 *Format: Digital download - ! scope=\\"row\\" Beaches (Demos)  *Released: 8 June 2018 *Label: The Mavis's (MAVIS0001) *Format: CD, download, streaming } ===Extended plays=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\" Details - ! scope=\\"row\\" Spindrift  *Released: 1993 *Label: MDS (SLIP0001) *Format: CD - ! scope=\\"row\\" Poseidon  *Released: May 1994 *Label: Bliss Inc.

Rubin is Professor of Psychology at Duke University. He is known for his work on the reminiscence bump as well as other topics related to autobiographical memory. He is most recognized for his research and publications regarding memory, specifically, the reminiscence bump and long term memory. Through extensive education and academic background his career and research started to flourish in the 1970s. Rubin remains active in the field of memory today. == Academic life  Academia === Rubin attended Carnegie-Mellon University for his undergraduate studies in Physics and Psychology. He received his Bachelor of Science for these two subjects and graduated in 1968. He then attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1968-1969 as a Special Student of Psychology before being accepted into graduate school at Harvard University in 1970. It was at Harvard that Rubin obtained his M.D. and his Ph.D in Psychology by 1974. === Career and honors === In 1968, Rubin worked as an Aerospace Engineer for NASA Electronics Research Center in Massachusetts. It was here that he pursued research and development in optics. From 1974-1978 he was an assistant professor of psychology at Lawrence University located in Appleton, Wisconsin. He then moved to Durham, North Carolina to continue as an assistant professor of psychology until 1981 when he became an associate professor of psychology. He remains dedicated to Duke University as he became a Professor of Psychology, Professor of Experimental Psychology, and a Professor of Neuroscience in 1987. These positions were held until 2008. In 2008, he was elected chair of the department and currently holds the position. Rubin has been awarded for his work on memory throughout the years. Some of his most notable honors are as followed: Named Chair of psychology department in 2008, Annual Distinguished Scholar Lecture Series in 2009, Honorary Doctorate at University of Aarhus in 2012, and in 2012, Rubin was elected a Fellow of the Society of Experimental Psychologists. === Current research === Rubin currently studies in the field of autobiographical memory at Duke University.

While Wong appeared in numerous films through the 1930s and 1940s, they were largely small uncredited parts. His biggest role was as Charlie the Cook in the movie King Kong (1933) and Son of Kong (1933). Wong's most memorable scene came in King Kong when he finds evidence that natives from Skull Island have been aboard the ship Venture, resulting in the kidnapping of heroine Ann Darrow. As Charlie the Cook, Wong yells, \\"All hands on deck! Everybody on deck!\\" This causes panic aboard ship which begins the quest for Ann's whereabouts and the discovery of King Kong.

The piece was Sousa's first successful operetta and his most successful stage work. The march \\"El Capitan\\" became a standard work both for brass bands and a crossover into other genres. El Capitan was first produced at the Tremont Theatre in Boston, beginning on April 13, 1896. After this tryout, it transferred to the old Broadway Theatre on 41st Street in New York on April 20, 1896, where it ran for 112 performances, starring DeWolf Hopper, Edna Wallace Hopper, John Parr, and Alfred Klein.Hischak, Thomas S.

After he secretly has the rebel leader El Capitan killed, he disguises himself as El Capitan. Estrelda, the daughter of the former viceroy, Cazzaro, impressed by tales of El Capitan's daring, falls in love with the disguised Medigua, who is already married. Meanwhile, the rebels capture the Lord Chamberlain, Pozzo, mistaking him for the viceroy. Hearing that her husband has been captured, Medigua's wife Marganza and daughter Isabel (who is being wooed by the handsome Verrada) go in search of Medigua. Medigua, still disguised as El Capitan, leads the hapless rebels against the Spaniards, taking them in circles until they are too tired to fight. The Spaniards win, the mistaken identities are revealed, the love stories are untangled after Medigua explains to his wife the flirtation with Estrelda, and the story ends happily. ==Musical numbers== Sheet music cover, 1896 Prelude ;Act I *Chorus: \\"Nobles of Castilian birth.\\" *Recitative and Solos: \\"Oh, beautiful land of Spain.\\" *Recitative Solo and Chorus: \\"From Peru's majestic mountains.\\" *Chorus: \\"Don Medigua, all for thy coming wait.\\" *Solo and Chorus: \\"If you examine human kind.\\" *Melodrama *Solo and Chorus: \\"When we hear the call for battle.\\" *Solo and Chorus: \\"Oh, spare a daughter.\\" *Chorus: \\"Lo, the awful man approaches.\\" *Solo and Chorus: \\"You see in me.\\" *Finale Act I ‚Äì \\"Bah!

She is a specialist in autism and psycholinguistics and has written and edited professional and lay books and over 100 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters on these subjects. She is currently on the advisory board of the journal Psychological Science in the Public Interest and associate editor for Cognitive Psychology, and she has previously held editorial positions for Memory & Cognition and Language and Cognitive Processes. She was also president of the Association for Psychological Science in 2007. ==Biography and research interests== Gernsbacher received a B.A. from the University of North Texas in 1976, an M.S. from University of Texas at Dallas in 1980, and a Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin in Human Experimental Psychology in 1983. She was employed at the University of Oregon from 1983-1992 before joining the faculty at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where she has remained ever since. Gernsbacher's research focuses on the cognitive processes and mechanisms that underlie language comprehension. She has challenged the view that language processing depends upon language-specific mechanisms, proposing instead that it draws on general cognitive processes such as working memory and pattern recognition. During recent years, motivated by the diagnosis of her son, Gernsbacher's research has focused on the cognitive and neurological processes of people with autism. As a result of investigating the language development of children with autism, Gernsbacher has posited that the speech difficulties associated with autism stem from motor planning challenges, not from intellectual limitations or social impairment. The implications of this perspective include a shift in focus from deficits in interpersonal communication to early sensory-motor challenges of children with autism, as well as recognition of previously unidentified competence in nonverbal children with autism. Gernsbacher is married and has one child. ==Honors (selected)== *2007 William James Distinguished Lecturer in Psychological Science, Southeastern Psychological Association *2007 John Kendall Lecturer in Psychology, Gustavus Adolphus College *2006 President of the Association for Psychological Science (formerly the American Psychological Society) *2003 Elected Fellow of the Society of Experimental Psychologists *2001 Senior Research Fellowship, National Institute of Deafness and Communication Disorders, National Institutes of Health *2000 Distinguished Scientist Lecturer, American Psychological Association *1999 Vilas Associate Research Award, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison *1998 Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education Award (POWRE), National Science Foundation *1995 Elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science *1994 Named ‚ÄúSir Frederic C.

It ranged across present-day Iraq, Palestine, Israel, Iran, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Turkey. ==Description== The Syrian wild ass, only one metre high at its shoulder, was the smallest equine, and could not be domesticated. Its coloring changed with the seasons ‚Äî a tawny olive coat for the summer months, and pale sandy yellow for the winter. It was known, like other onagers, to be untameable, and was compared to a thoroughbred horse for its beauty and strength. ==Distribution and habitat== The Syrian wild ass lived in deserts, semi-deserts, arid grasslands and mountain steppes. Native to West Asia, they were found in Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Iran, Turkey, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. ==Ecology and behaviorDiet=== The Syrian wild ass was a grazer. It fed on grass, herbs, leaves, shrubs and tree branches. ===Predation=== Syrian wild asses were preyed upon by Asiatic lions, Arabian leopards, striped hyenas, Syrian brown bears, Arabian wolves and Caspian tigers. Asiatic cheetahs may have also preyed on foals. ==History== European travelers in the Middle East during the 15th and 16th centuries reported seeing large herds. However, its numbers began to drop precipitously during the 18th and 19th centuries due to overhunting, and its existence was further imperiled by the regional upheaval of World War I. The last known wild specimen was fatally shot in 1927 at al Ghams near the Azraq oasis in Jordan, and the last captive specimen died the same year at the Tiergarten Sch√∂nbrunn, in Vienna. == Restoration == After the extinction of the Syrian wild ass, the Persian onager from Iran was chosen as the appropriate subspecies to replace the extinct onagers in the Middle East. The Persian onager was then introduced to the protected areas of Saudi Arabia and Jordan. It was also reintroduced, along with the Turkmenian kulan, to Israel, where they both reproduce wild ass hybrids in the Negev Mountains and the Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve. == Cultural references == * It is believed this may be the \\"wild ass\\" which Ishmael was prophesied to be in Genesis in the Old Testament. References also appear in the Old Testament books of Job, Psalms, Jeremiah and the Deuterocanonical book of Sirach. * The Qur‚Äôan, the main book of Islam, in Surat al-Muddaththir, refers to a scene of humur (, 'asses' or 'donkeys') fleeing from a qaswarah (, 'lion'). This was to criticize people who were averse to Muhammad's teachings, such as supporting the welfare of the less wealthy. ==Related subspecies== * Mongolian wild ass (khulan), Equus hemionus hemionus * Turkmenian kulan (kulan), Equus hemionus kulan * Indian wild ass (khur), Equus hemionus khur * Persian onager (gur), Equus hemionus onager ==References== Category:1927 in the environment Category:Equus (genus) Category:Extinct mammals Category:Extinct mammals of Asia Category:Mammal extinctions since 1500 Category:Mammals described in 1855 Category:Species endangered by warfare Category:Species made extinct by human activities ","title":"Syrian wild ass"},{"id":"9137495","text":"Journal Citation Reports (JCR) is an annual publication by Clarivate Analytics (previously the intellectual property of Thomson Reuters).

Actors are Alexander Pope, Elizabeth Younge, Mary Wells, William Farren the Elder, Thomas Hull and George Inchbald The Gamester is a Caroline era stage play, a comedy of manners written by James Shirley, premiered in 1633 and first published in 1637. The play is noteworthy for its realistic and detailed picture of gambling in its era. The play was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 11 November 1633. In his office record book, Herbert noted that on 6 February 1634, :\\"The Gamester was acted at Court, made by Sherley, out of a plot of the King's, given him by me; and well liked. The King said it was the best play he had seen for seven years.\\"Arthur Huntington Nason, James Shirley, Dramatist: A Biographical and Critical Study, New York, Columbia University Press, 1915; p. 285.Kevin Sharpe, Criticism and Compliment: The Politics of Literature in the England of Charles I, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1990; p. 44. Apart from the King's suggestion, Shirley's source for the plot of his play is the Ducento novelle of Celio Malespini. The play was performed by Queen Henrietta's Men, both at Court and at the regular theatre, the Cockpit in Drury Lane. The 1637 quarto was printed by John Norton for the booksellers Andrew Crooke and William Cooke. Shirley's play was a popular success in its own era, and in the next century was adapted by Charles Johnson into The Wife's Relief (1711) and J. Poole (The Wife's Strategem, 1827). ==Synopsis== In the main plot, the protagonist, Wilding, neglects his faithful and loving wife in favour of her ward Penelope; he even orders his wife to solicit her ward for him. Mistress Wilding appears to obey, and informs Wilding that she has arranged an assignation. When the time comes, however, Wilding is so wrapped up in his gambling that he sends his friend Hazard to keep the appointment and make his excuses. The next day, Wilding is doubly distressed to learn from Hazard that the meeting was for him, in romantic terms, a wonderful success, and from his wife that she had taken Penelope's place the night before. To conceal his shame, Wilding arranges for Hazard to marry Penelope, and doubles her dowry. (Since Hazard and Penelope were already in love, this is all to the good as far as they are concerned.) Once Wilding has repented of his shameful ways, he is told the truth: Hazard found both women waiting on the night in question, prepared to admonish the wayward husband. Together the three of them planned Wilding's comeuppance. In the play's subplot, a wealthy citizen called Old Barnacle desires his nephew (inevitably known as Young Barnacle) to acquire a reputation as a gallant and a man about town. To achieve this, Old Barnacle pays Hazard, who has just such a reputation, ¬£100 to allow Young Barnacle to strike him in a gambling house. The ploy is, if anything, too successful: Young Barnacle instantly wins a reputation as a bravo and picks quarrels wherever he goes. Old Barnacle, now frightened that his nephew will soon get himself killed, pays Hazard another ¬£100 to undo the mischief. Hazard gives Young Barnacle his required and merited beating, and then reveals the entire matter. This subplot features the candid picture of the world of tavern and gambling house for which the play is noted, with supporting characters named Little-stock, Acre-less, and Sell- Away. The third-level plot is unusual in being romantic and dramatic instead of the normal comic subplot; it involves the lovers Delamore and Leonora, and Beaumont and Violante. Beaumont is imprisoned, charged with killing Delamore in a duel. Sir Richard Hurry, Leonora's father and the judge in the case, orders his daughter to marry Beaumont, and claims that he will provide Beaumont's pardon if the marriage occurs. Beaumont, however, refuses to betray his commitment to Violante. In a final confrontation, Beaumont remains faithful to his love; Hurry condemns Beaumont...to marry Violante. It transpires that Delamore has survived the duel and is recovering. ==References== Category:English Renaissance plays Category:1633 plays Category:Plays by James Shirley ","title":"The Gamester"},{"id":"9137556","text":"aLIVE in Florida is the second live album by Rebecca St. James.

In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) is invited by Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) to speak to his business school class. When many of the students question the usefulness of paper in a computerized world, Michael attempts to inform the class of how essential paper is. Meanwhile, a bat becomes trapped in the office, leading Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) on a mission to protect the employees. The episode was written by Brent Forrester, and directed by Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly creator Joss Whedon. Whedon became involved with the show due to being a friend of series creator Greg Daniels as well as series co-star Jenna Fischer. Despite Whedon's experience with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the subplot about Dwight coming to believe that Jim Halpert is a vampire was entirely coincidental. The episode aired on NBC on February 15, 2007, and was seen by an estimated 8.84 million viewers according to Nielsen Media Research. It was positively received by television critics, with several writing positively of Joss Whedon's involvement. Carell's performance was also positively received, and several critics applauded the scene in which Michael says positive things about Pam's art. ==Synopsis== Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) invites Michael Scott (Steve Carell) to speak at his business-school class. Michael is excited, but Ryan admits in a talking head interview that he has only invited Michael because his professor promised to bump up the grade of any student who brings his boss into class. During his introduction of Michael, Ryan predicts that Dunder Mifflin will become obsolete within five to ten years. However, Michael could not hear him and proceeds to ruin the event with his antics (including tearing pages out of a student's textbook to prove you \\"can't learn from textbooks\\"). One of Ryan's classmates asks for Michael's opinion of Ryan's prediction. Infuriated and hurt, Michael screams that Ryan has not made a sale and punishes him by relocating his desk to the \\"annex,\\" where Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) works. Kelly babbles uncontrollably in excitement at the news. Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) discovers a bat in the ceiling. It flies through the office, sending the employees scurrying for cover. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) exploit Dwight's paranoia, and pretend that Jim was bitten by the bat and is turning into a vampire. Jim calls animal control, but Dwight insists on catching the bat himself even after 5 p.m. passes and the other employees go home, save Meredith (Kate Flannery), who continues to hide in the breakroom for fear of the bat. Dwight eventually catches the bat with a garbage bag after it lands on Meredith's head. Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), in the meantime, invites her co-workers to her art show after work. At the show, Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) and his partner Gil (Tom Chick) critique her art, with Gil dismissing it as \\"motel art,\\" not realizing that she is standing right behind them. None of her other co-workers show, leaving her feeling alienated and sad. Roy comes by and compliments her work, but obviously does so as a \\"boyfriend's gesture\\" with no sincere appreciation for art. The general attendees show little interest in her drawings, and she begins to doubt her abilities. As she begins to take her work down, Michael arrives, having been delayed by the trip back to the office to move Ryan's things. He expresses sincere awe for her work and asks to buy her drawing of the office building, saying that he is very proud of her. Pam embraces him as her eyes tear up. Michael hangs Pam's drawing on the wall next to his office. == Production == \\"Business School\\" was directed by Joss Whedon. \\"Business School\\" was the second Office episode written by Brent Forrester. Forrester had previously written \\"The Merger.\\" The episode was the first to be directed by Joss Whedon. Whedon, who is a friend of both producer Greg Daniels and Jenna Fischer, and also met most of the production staff prior to the episode, stated that he chose to direct the episode \\"because I already know the writing staff and a bunch of the cast, and I adore the show.\\" When informed that the episode was about a bat entering into the office and one of the characters pretending to be a vampire, Whedon thought that it was a joke; in reference to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, he quipped to the crew, \\"Didn't I just leave this party?\\" In an interview featured on the third season DVD, Whedon joked that the \\"Business School\\" episode and his former TV show were very similar because \\"Buffy‚Ä¶was sad and depressing but‚Ä¶it was funny. Especially when people died. And a lot of people do die in ['Business School'].\\" But upon completing the episode, Whedon said, \\"That was just coincidence. But that's how that happened. God, it was fun.\\" Whedon stated that he was surprised with the amount of input he was allowed with the script. \\"I wouldn't say freedom to do things with it‚Ä¶ But way more input was asked for than I would have ever anticipated.\\" At Pam's art show, the pieces which she was supposed to have painted did not suit Whedon; he explained, \\"I got to the set and saw Pam's art, and I was like, 'This is not right. Whedon said that he held up filming for more than an hour until the staff was able create new pieces of art. For the scenes which involved filming with a bat, the production team used an actual bat, an animated bat, and a mechanical bat. When around the actual bat, Kate Flannery, who portrays Meredith Palmer, stated that \\"we had to be extremely quiet around [it], basically pretending to scream.\\" California State University, Northridge served as the backdrop for Ryan's business school and the art show; the scenes at the institution were shot in January 2007. ==Reception== \\"Business School\\" first aired on February 15, 2007 in the United States on NBC. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was watched by an estimated 8.84 million viewers. The Office garnered a 4.4/11 rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. This means that it was seen by 4.4 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode received generally good reviews from critics. Brian Zoromski, of IGN, stated that Business School' was an exercise in what works best in an Office episode.\\" Zoromski also praised Joss Whedon's directorial debut for the show, stating that \\"Whedon's direction and sense of humor was both excellently put to use and alluded to in the scenes in which Jim hilariously pretended to become a vampire.\\" Zoromski went on to say that the acting of John Krasinski and Rashida Jones, who portrays Karen Filippelli, helped to make the vampire scenes the funniest parts of the episode. He gave the episode a 9.1 out of 10. Abby West, of Entertainment Weekly, stated that \\"This show has always been able to turn on a dime and take the comedy to a soul-stirring dramatic climax with just the lightest of touches, and last night was no different.\\" West went on to praise Michael and Pam's scene at the art show as one of these moments. In a retrospective review of the show's third season, Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A.\\" Adams highlighted Carell's acting, writing, \\"On this rewatch, I found myself slack-jawed at how deep Carell gets into Michael's 'saying something without saying anything' style.\\" Adams also applauded the way that Carell's character brings honesty to the final scene in which Michael praises Pam's art and offers to buy it for the office, writing, \\"The boss should keep his mouth shut more often, but every once in a while, that constant stream of bad jokes, misattributed information, and banalities produces a warm and uplifting sentiment.\\" Finally, Adams compared \\"Business School\\" with previous television episodes that Joss Whedon has written, noting that the characters' \\"triumphs over naysayers and foreboding villains\\" (e.g., Pam receiving harsh criticism about her art only to be vindicated in the end, Michael being humiliated in Ryan's business class but ultimately affirming his strength as an effective salesman) was akin to how Whedon often wrote his heroes triumphing over seasonal \\"Big Bads.\\" ==References== ==External links== * \\"Business School\\" at NBC.com * * Category:2007 American television episodes Category:The Office (American season 3) episodes Category:Television programs directed by Joss Whedon ","title":"Business School (The Office)"},{"id":"9137587","text":"Timothy Alan Kinnan (born April 24, 1948) was a Lieutenant General in the United States Air Force he retired from active duty in September 2004. ==Personal and family background== Kinnan was born in Tacoma, Washington to the late Henry Wallace (\\"Wally\\") Kinnan, and Marjorie Ahrendt.

The range is separated into three distinct areas; southeastern Nigeria; the lower part of the Congo basin; and northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo extending into western Uganda. Its typical habitat is humid lowland forest where it favours dense undergrowth. It also inhabits plantations, secondary forest, cleared areas and areas round human habitations. ==Ecology== Bates's pygmy antelope eat leaves, buds, shoots, fungus, grass, and herbs. They also eat crops, which makes them unpopular with farmers. They are often caught in snares near agricultural fields. They have a typical territory of . Males are territorial, marking their territory with scent produced in the preorbital glands. Females are friendlier with each other and sometimes live in small groups. They bark when fleeing.

He studied medicine at the University of Melbourne, graduating in 1960, and served in the Royal Australian Navy from 1962 to 1965.http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/177_03_050802/sutherland_obit_fm.html ==The CSL years== In 1966 Sutherland joined the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and was soon appointed Head of Immunology Research, a position which he held for 28 years. The death in January 1979 of a young girl, Christine Sturges, from a funnel-web spider bite prompted Sutherland to look for a funnel-web antivenom.http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s25168.htm Many previous researchers had failed to develop such an antivenom, but Sutherland persevered. In January 1980, a two-year-old boy James Cully was bitten by a funnel-web, and died three days later. This was the spider's 13th recorded victim. Later that year, Sutherland's team produced an effective antivenom and since then no deaths have been recorded from funnelweb bites. The antivenom had its first success when it was used to treat a 49-year-old Sydney man, Gordon Wheatley, who was bitten by a funnel-web on 31 January 1981. He completely recovered after 2 days in hospital. Sutherland also led research into snakebite treatment, working on antivenoms and developing venom detection kits to help hospital staff determine appropriate treatment for a bite. In the 1970s, he developed the pressure immobilisation technique (a first-aid procedure) for both snake and funnelweb bites,http://www.health.qld.gov.au/poisonsinformationcentre/bites_stings/bs_pressure.asp replacing treatments such as tourniquets that were often harmful to the patient. ==Later years== In 1994 CSL was privatised and the antivenom research program was closed, prompting Sutherland to leave the organisation for the University of Melbourne. Here he founded the Australian Venom Research Unit, where he worked until 1999 when striatonigral degeneration, a condition similar to Parkinson's disease, forced him to retire. Even in retirement he continued to work, co-authoring three books, including \\"Venomous Creatures of Australia\\", which became its publisher's (Oxford University Press) best- selling Australian book. When he died in 2002, he had already written his own death notice: \\"Struan would like to inform his friends and acquaintances that he fell off his perch on Friday, 11 January 2002, and is to be privately cremated. No flowers please. Donations to Australian Venom Research Unit, Melbourne University.\\"http://www.apesma.asn.au/newsviews/professional_update/2002/jan_feb/venomous_life.htm Sutherland's autobiography, \\"A Venomous Life\\" was published in 1998 by Highland House Publishing, Melbourne (). He also wrote \\"Hydroponics For Everyone\\", about one of his hobbies. Sutherland had a humorous interview with Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine in Last Chance to See. ==Personal== He was married three times. ==Honours== In the Australia Day honours of 2002, two weeks after his death, Sutherland was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), effective from 7 February 2000, for \\"service to science as a leading contributor to research in clinical toxicology and the biology of Australia's venomous creatures, and for the development of the funnel web spider antivenom\\".It's an Honour: AO ==References== * Struan K Sutherland, A Venomous Life: the Autobiography of Professor Struan Sutherland (Melbourne: Hyland House, 1998). * Mark Whitaker, Spiderman, Weekend Australian Magazine, 13‚Äì14 March 1999. ==External links== *Medical Journal of Australia obituary *BMJ obituary *Entry at PM&C; Awards site Category:People from Bendigo Category:Australian scientists Category:Australian medical researchers Category:1936 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Deaths from multiple system atrophy Category:Officers of the Order of Australia ","title":"Struan Sutherland"},{"id":"9137626","text":"The Brainies is a puzzle game released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System console and Atari ST, Amiga, Apple IIgs, Macintosh, and Amstrad CPC computers.

Its focus is on structural biology with a strong history in methods development and the application of X-ray crystallography in fundamental studies. ==Medical research== HWI scientists work to find the fundamental causes of many diseases. For example, cancer is being attacked by identifying new classes of anti-tumor agents including new inhibitors for hormone-dependent breast tumors. Other projects include: *Finding new ways to fight opportunistic infections in AIDS patients *Combating inflammation in arthritis and cardiovascular disease *Preventing bronchial infections in cystic fibrosis patients HWI scientists use a methodology known as structural biology, which allows them to create 3D models of the molecules that build up cells. The investigation results provide many insights into how these molecular machines work, including the starting points for the design of better drugs. HWI is also focused to developing highly trained researchers and in its role as the Department of Structural and Computational Biology for the University at Buffalo, the Institute typically trains about a dozen PhD students and sponsors internship programs for high school and college students. ==History== The Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute was founded in 1956 as the \\"Medical Foundation of Buffalo\\" and came into existence through the combined efforts of Dr. George F. Koepf, who provided the vision, and Helen Woodward Rivas, who provided generous financial support. Koepf was a physician and endocrinologist whose interest in research began during his second year at medical school and continued at Johns Hopkins University. After leaving Johns Hopkins, he returned to practice medicine in Buffalo and became a founding member of the Buffalo Medical Group. One of his patients, Helen Woodward Rivas, expressed great interest in funding a medical research effort in Buffalo. Through her $3 million () gift, the Medical Foundation (MFB) came into being. Herbert Hauptman at University of Buffalo graduation in 2009An example of the basic research carried out includes studying disease processes at the molecular scale. For example it was reportedHauptman closer to breast cancer cure that a researcher at the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute had moved a step closer to a cure, and possibly the prevention, of the most common type of breast cancer. In 1994, the Medical Foundation was renamed the Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute. The name \\"Hauptman\\" comes from Herbert A. Hauptman, who pioneered mathematical techniques for determining atomic structure from X-ray diffraction. For this discovery, Hauptman and Jerome Karle were awarded the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1985. In 1999, the Institute received a three-year $1.5 million () challenge grant from the John R. Oishei Foundation along with a $750,000 () award from the Margaret L. Wendt Foundation that established a Structural Biology Center at HWI. All aspects of structural research from isolating the gene that codes for a protein of interest to applying the latest crystallographic methods are now possible here. Through this Center, HWI scientists were able to create new and improved crystal growth methods including the development of a novel and patented high-throughput robotic crystallization technique for expediting and optimizing the crystallization process. In 2001, BWI became a founding partner of the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus \\"BNMC,\\" and created the University at Buffalo Department of Structural Biology. Dr. George DeTitta was appointed Executive Director and CEO and Dr. Walter Pangborn was appointed to Executive Vice President. Shortly thereafter, four new scientists were added. As the University at Buffalo and the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, both members of BNMC, began plans to construct new facilities, HWI joined to form the Buffalo Life Sciences Complex which is located in the heart of the BNMC adjacent to the UB and RPCI sites. CannonDesign was retained along with architect Mehrdad Yazdani to design a research and office complex and construction of the Structural Biology Research Center began in August 2003, through the support of New York State, the Federal Government, local foundations, community leaders, and individuals, as well as financing through KeyBank. BWI moved into the new facility in April 2005, and have since recruited four additional scientists to the facility. ===Leadership=== On April 1, 2008, George DeTitta stepped down as CEO to return to full-time work in the lab and on July 1, 2008, Eaton E. (Ed) Lattman, formerly a Professor of Biophysics at Johns Hopkins University became HWI's new CEO. Ed was previously the Dean of Research and Graduate Education at Hopkins. On December 1, 2014, Dr. Edward H. Snell was appointed CEO following eight years of service to HWI as a Senior Research Scientist. Before joining HWI, Dr. Snell was a staff scientist in NASA‚Äôs Structural Biology Laboratory at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. ===Awards=== The institute has sponsored the award \\"Pioneer of Science\\". It also runs a popular annual wine tasting event where Riedel glassware is coupled with quality wines and champagne and the influence of the shape of the glass on the taste demonstrated. The link between the glass, wine and research, comes from the use of crystals in the research and the rich information they supply when examined in detail. ==See also== *Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus *Herbert A.

The First Samurai was originally released in September 1991 for the Amiga and Atari ST, and was later ported to the Commodore 64, MS-DOS and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was followed by a sequel, Second Samurai. In 2011, The First Samurai was ported to iOS. ==Plot== In The First Samurai, the protagonist undertakes a quest as the first samurai in the history of feudal Japan, and must compete against rival swordsmen. ==Gameplay== Fighting some bats Eating food and drinking sake will help the player get stronger, while fire and enemy contact will weaken the samurai. The main objective in a level is to collect a set of four items which must be used to get access to the area with the end of level boss. Magic pots serve as checkpoints and are activated with the energy of the player's sword. Killing a monster releases a portion of sword energy which the player then collects automatically. Using a bell at the right place removes an obstacle blocking the player's path. The player starts out as a hermit in an ancient forest, but he eventually becomes powerful enough to fight in the villages and towns, and eventually the dungeons. ==Development== The First Samurai began development in July 1990, and was originally scheduled for a September 1991 release for Amiga and Atari ST, with a DOS port stated to be 'unplanned' at the time. In a December 1990 issue of British gaming magazine The One, The One interviewed team members from Vivid Image for information regarding The First Samurai's development in a pre- release interview. The First Samurai's samurai theme was first conceived by graphic artist Paul 'Dokk' Docherty as a 'random thought' while watching the 1954 monster film Them!, and Docherty expresses that \\"At the time we were in the middle of designing another game but we weren't very happy with it.\\" The One purported that the title The First Samurai's correlation to The Last Ninja is \\"purely coincidental\\". Docherty's proposal of a samurai theme was received by Vivid Image as \\"exactly what they were looking for\\", and Docherty states that \\"We wanted something fairly mystical so that we could put in lots of special effects. Samurai also have a very strong sense of honour - that fitted in with our plot.\\" Mev Dinc, The First Samurai's project manager, expressed that programmer Raffaele Cecco was invited to the project \\"because he's not only a very good programmer, he also comes up with lots of really good ideas. If I suggest one thing, he usually comes back with three.\\" The First Samurai's development was described by The One as \\"an ongoing creative process in which everyone is encouraged to participate\\", and Dinc expressed that \\"Deciding on sprites and backgrounds that everybody is happy with can be time-consuming. We don't argue, we just have constructive discussions.\\" User-friendly controls were a priority in the game's development, and John Twiddy, The First Samurai's map editor, stated that \\"You have to be able to pick up the joystick and just play the game.\\" The balance between easy-to-learn controls and allowing the player an array of different attacks was an important factor in The First Samurai's design, and Twiddy stated that \\"The main thing is to get lots of manoeuvres in there. They're all effective so ultimately you don't actually need to know how you've done each one.\\" The animations in response to the player's inputs were partially inspired by arcade games, and Twiddy states that ‚ÄùIn some arcade games, when your opponent's in a certain position you end up grabbing them and throwing them over your shoulder. It looks like you're doing something spectacular but in fact it's the computer showing standard joystick moves in different ways on screen. That's a feature we'd like to include.\\" The First Samurai was the first 16-bit game that Raffaele Cecco worked on, and he spent the first two months on the project learning how to program for the Amiga, stating that \\"Obviously I couldn't use any old sprite handling or scrolling routines because I didn't have any. I've had to start everything from scratch.\\" The First Samurai was programmed on a 386 PC using the Programmer's Development System (PDS) developed by Fruad Katon. Vivid Image deliberately chose a \\"fairly long\\" development period according to The One, and Cecco expressed that \\"We want to make certain there's plenty of time at the end for tweaking. This is the sort of game where it all comes down to how many enemies there are and where they're positioned.\\" The First Samurai's environment is defined by white blocks superimposed over the game's graphics; these blocks determine attributes such as the edge of a platform, the spawn point of entities, whether a wall is climbable, and collision detection. For the Atari ST port, all the blocks needed to be 'pre-shifted', and a Vivid Images team member expressed that \\"We need to know how many there are so we can calculate them in advance; the editor automatically keeps track of all the different types of blocks on screen.\\" John Twiddy created a custom map editor for The First Samurai which runs concurrently with Deluxe Paint and allows graphics to be loaded in, background graphics to be selected & positioned, and an object's depth to be defined relative to other objects. More features were incorporated into The First Samurai's map editor over the course of the game's development, and Docherty stated that \\"Whenever we want a new feature we simply phone John up and ask him to include it.\\" Prioritizing sound effect design over a soundtrack was a design decision made in part due to memory restrictions, as well as Vivid Images' belief that 'subtle' sound effects would 'add more atmosphere'. Due to memory restrictions, the protagonist's sprites are separated into pieces, e.g. the limbs, torso, and legs are stored separately; this also allows animations to be made easier, as rather than create a new sprite for a different animation, it could be created from existing sprites 'pieced together'. At the stage of development at which the interview was conducted, The First Samurai had 105 different limb sprites, and 30 different animations using those sprites. A level taking place in a sewer was scrapped before release due to memory restrictions, particularly due to the level's 'running water' sprites, stated to take up 'almost as much memory' as the protagonist's sprite. The First Samurai runs at 25 frames per second, as a Vivid Images team member expressed that \\"We decided not to go for 50 frames because it's got too many limitations. You can't have huge areas of sprites and animation if you want that kind of speed.\\" The Amiga version of First Samurai cost 'around 84' Deutschmark in 1992, and was released on two floppy disks. ==Reception== Amiga Joker gave the Amiga version of First Samurai an overall score of 82%, comparing it to other similar games such as Shadow Dancer and The Last Ninja, and expressing that \\"If someone were to say that the game isn't really original, they would be correct. However, First Samurai impresses not so much with an innovative idea, but more with technical brilliance and excellent gameplay.\\" Amiga Joker praises First Samurai's 'compelling' gameplay, noting the number of usable weapons, its \\"difficult\\" puzzles, and \\"crafty\\" level design, particularly praising the inclusion of hidden areas and items.

Critics for Electronic Gaming Monthly, GamePro, and Maximum all praised the arcade-perfect emulation of the games and the strong selection, generally concurring that all of the included games except Bubbles are classics which remain immensely fun. Mark Lefebyre of EGM called it \\"a grand compilation that takes you back to what games are meant to be... fun.\\" GamePro concluded that \\"If you're into retro gaming, this compilation of six early-'80s coin-op titles is a true collectible.\\" Maximum declared, \\"All of the games (bar the easily forgettable Bubbles) remain incredibly playable and provide a super-stiff challenge that puts a great deal of the current crop of PlayStation titles to shame.\\" Reviewing the PC version, Next Generation said the compilation contains \\"arcade-perfect\\" conversions of \\"the arcade games that made this industry what it is today\\", particularly praising the retention of the bugs, which the reviewer felt were among the best features of the arcade originals. He was also pleased with the settings modes and multimedia bonus material, and concluded, \\"If you're into the retro trip, you can't do better than this disc.\\" Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"These games are fun to play, but only for about a half hour. After that, the urge for Warcraft 2 will most certainly win out over Robotron.\\" Rich Leadbetter gave the Saturn version a strong recommendation in Sega Saturn Magazine, saying that the gameplay design, originality, and challenge of all the included games had held up well. Unlike most of the compilation's reviewers, he argued that Bubbles, though obscure, is solidly entertaining. Reviews for the Genesis version were more mixed. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly were enthusiastic about the genuinely arcade-perfect conversions and enjoyed the games, but questioned why this version took so long to come out and why Bubbles had been omitted. Sushi-X pointed out that due to the existence of the Genesis Nomad, the Genesis version was the first portable version of the games in the collection. GamePro criticized the compilation's lack of extras as compared to Namco Museum, and opined that the games are \\"average\\". However, they singled out Robotron: 2084 as the best of the five \\"with its swarming enemies that create genuine suspense.\\" Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame rated the game.com version three stars out of five and wrote, \\"Considering the inherent limitations of a black-and-white handheld system, the designers of Williams Arcade Classics for the game.com did about as good a job as could be expected with this compilation.

An entry in Compile's shooter series, Aleste, MUSHA places the player in the role of a flying mecha pilot who must destroy a large super intelligent computer threatening planet Earth. The game had a working title of Aleste 2 and featured a style similar to the first game, but it was redirected to a Japanese aesthetic and speed metal soundtrack. Initial reception for MUSHA was mixed. Critics generally agreed the game was enjoyable with great graphics, but found themselves overwhelmed by the number of scrolling shooters on the Genesis and felt the title was unremarkable and lacked challenge. The game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan in 2008, and the West in 2009. In retrospective reviews, MUSHA was cited for its challenging gameplay, strong soundtrack, and graphics that were ahead of its time. == Gameplay == MUSHA features a Japanese aesthetic, including this boss character with a Noh mask. MUSHA is a vertically scrolling shooter. The player takes on the role of Terri, a pilot who flies a specially designed mecha vehicle with advanced weaponry called a MUSHA. She is sent to fight the human-built Dire 51 supercomputer that has begun attacking Earth from space in the year 2290. The gameplay conventions are largely retained from earlier Aleste titles. The player has a main gun that can be powered up by collecting \\"Power Chips\\". There are also three different special weapons that can be picked up: piercing lasers, fire-based explosives and rotating shields. They can be upgraded if the same weapon is picked up that is currently being used. If hit while a special weapon is equipped, the player will lose the special weapon but remain alive. Getting hit without a special weapon will result in losing a life. For every three Power Chips collected, the player obtains a drone similar to those in the Gradius series. Only two drones can be equipped at any one moment; extras are stored. These drones can be set to one of six attack modes, such as aiming forward, behind, or rotating around the player. ==Development== A young team at Compile developed MUSHA in less than a year. They originally made a prototype for a new game in the Aleste series called \\"Aleste 2\\" for the Sega Genesis, but postponed the project. The team was still feeling pressure to create a game, and also wanted to change the direction of the Aleste series. Designer Kazuyuki Nakashima came up with a design that ignored most of the style of previous Aleste games and instead went with a Japanese aesthetic, including a character with a Noh mask. This change in direction motivated the team to pick up remnants of \\"Aleste 2\\" and push it into a new direction. The valley stage in MUSHA utilizes the Genesis's vertical parallax scrolling capabilities, which was later highlighted by critics as one of the game's most impressive technical features. The stage was programmed by Yuuichi Sotoyama, who also programmed the enemies that move in and out of the depths of the valley, and tiles that fall into the screen in other stages. Sotoyama worked with the sound effects programmer Masanobu Tsukamoto to modulate the frequency of the sound effects when objects moved in and out of the screen to simulate the Doppler effect. === Music === For MUSHA's soundtrack, Nakashima originally presented an idea for what he called \\"Edo Metal\\" music to composer Toshiaki Sakoda. They eventually agreed on creating a speed metal soundtrack which would match the fast scrolling action of the game. At the time MUSHA was developed, Sakoda felt most shooting game soundtracks were primarily fusion and mechanically sounding games that lacked a cohesive theme. He wanted this soundtrack to be the first heavy metal game soundtrack, or how he called it, a \\"heady metal suite\\" or \\"heavy metal rhapsody\\". To compose the music, Sakoda used real instruments, then notated the music on an MSX computer and converted it onto a PC-9800. Since he did not like mechanical sounds, he programmed the virtual instruments to sound like they were played by humans. Sakoda worked closely with sound effects programmer Masanobu Tsukamoto. Since the game had limited sound channels, or tracks, he exercised caution not to create too many simultaneous sounds so the sound effects would not cut out the music. Sakoda only had four channels to use in any given song, one of which was always fixed on drums. After the soundtrack was nearly finished, Compile leadership told Sakoda to change the music to something which fit the Japanese aesthetic. After hearing a new soundtrack with plucky Japanese instruments, leadership told Sakoda to revert to his original music. ===Release=== MUSHA was first released in Japan on December 21, 1990. It was released in North America the following year. == Reception == MUSHA received mixed reviews at release. Critics found themselves overwhelmed by the number of shoot 'em ups on the Sega Genesis, and considered MUSHA to be another standard shooter offering. Many wrote about the graphics in positive light. Richard Leadbetter from Computer and Video Games found the visuals to be smooth and highlighted the parallax scrolling effect in the canyon level. Frank Martinez Jr. from GameFan also praised the parallax scrolling in addition to the enemy and character sprite detail. The writers at Raze positively noted the game's oriental design and explosion effects. The game's difficulty was a common point of criticism. Many noted MUSHA to be too easy and too short. Some wrote that it may be fun for shooter novices, but more experienced players would find it unchallenging. The music also received mixed comments. Leadbetter concluded that \\"MUSHA is a smooth playable blast, but it's a shame it's so unoriginal and unchallenging\\" Retrospective reviews for the re-release of MUSHA on the Wii's Virtual Console in 2009 were much more positive. Both Lucas M. Thomas of IGN and Damien McFarren of Nintendo Life praised the title's detailed graphics, fast-paced soundtrack, and tough difficulty. Since the original cartridges have become rare and expensive, both reviewers also commended the release for providing players an accessible way to play it. McFarren concluded by calling it one of the best shoot 'em ups on the Sega Genesis and the 16-bit era overall. Thomas called it one of the best \\"classic shooters.\\" Levi Buchanan of IGN placed MUSHA at number five on his \\"Top 10 Classic Shoot 'Em Ups\\" list, dubbing it Compile's greatest shooter and one of the best shooters on the Genesis. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *Musha Aleste for Virtual Console Category:1990 video games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Vertically scrolling shooters Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games set in Japan Category:Virtual Console games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Toshiaki Sakoda Category:Single-player video games Category:Compile (company) games Category:Toaplan games Category:Video games set in the 23rd century Category:Sega Genesis-only games ","title":"MUSHA"},{"id":"9138042","text":"Robley Dunglison (4 January 1798 ‚Äì 1 April 1869) was an English physician who moved to America to join the first faculty of the University of Virginia.

It is a guenon of the C. mitis group, native to West Africa and living to some extent in rain forests, but more often in the transition zone between rain forest and savannah. It is primarily arboreal and often associates with monkeys of other species. Both their common names come from the monkeys' prominent white nose. The greater spot-nosed monkey lives in groups consisting of one adult male, a number of adult females, and their dependent offspring. Little recent research has been conducted into its behaviour, and most has concentrated on its auditory communication. Males use three call types which have been described as 'booms', 'pyows', and 'hacks'. These are used in a number of contexts including as alarm calls. As in some other species of monkeys, the acoustical structure of greater spot-nosed monkey alarm calls it has been argued to vary according to the kind of predator spotted. The monkey reportedly combines different sounds into a sequence, which has an entirely different meaning from the sounds out of which it is made. For instance, the sound \\"pyow\\" alone means another animal, like a leopard, is lurking nearby, and \\"hack\\" means a flying animal, like an eagle, is flying nearby, but when the two are combined, as in the sequence \\"pyow pyow hack hack hack hack\\", they have an entirely different meaning: Let's get out of here and move to another place.

He was probably a Lombard in the entourage of Charlemagne when he was sent in 788 to lead Hildeprand of Spoleto and Grimoald III of Benevento in cooperation with Frankish troops against a Byzantine invasion. In this, his first recorded action, he was successful, defeating the Greeks led by Theodoros in Apulia. Hildeprand, however, died on the campaign and Charlemagne appointed Winiges to succeed him in the Duchy of Spoleto. Winiges was appointed by Charlemagne to act as his missus dominicus in the Ducatus Romae and he was at Saint Peter's Basilica when Pope Leo III was assaulted on 25 April 799. It was then he who brought him to shelter in Spoleto until he could safely return to Rome. Winiges got involved in a war with Grimoald of Benevento, however, and was captured while being besieged at Lucera in 802. He was held captive for a year before being released in 803.Hodgkin, VIII, 256. According to Einhard, Grimaldus Beneventanorum dux captured Winigisum comitem Spoletii at Luceria and \\"held [him] in honourable captivity\\" until the next year. According to the Annales Fuldenses, he was both besieged and captured by Grimoldo in 803. While Leo III was nearing death in 815, the Roman citizens revolted, but King Bernard sent Winiges to Rome to quell the unrest.

The Court found that the federal Public Service Employment Act (PSEA), which gave preference to citizens when referring to departments, was discriminatory. The violation was saved under section 1 of the Charter as a reasonable limitation on equality rights. ==Background== Several foreign nationals applied to the federal government for employment. Section 16(4)(c) of the PSEA gave preference to Canadian citizens when allocating applicants to different departments. The foreign nationals applied to the Federal Court of Canada to strike out the provision. The Federal Court held the provision violated section 15 but was saved by section 1. The Federal Court of Appeal upheld the decision. ==Reasons of the court== Bastarache J wrote for the majority in upholding the provision. In his application of the Law test for section 15, he noted that by creating the distinction between citizen and foreign national, Parliament was placing an additional burden on already disadvantaged group. He said it was well settled that foreign nationals are a group that do suffer from stereotypes, marginalization and historical disadvantage, but the Act does not attempt to compensate for this. Bastarache J spent some time considering the element of \\"dignity\\" introduced in Law v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration). Dignity inquiry requires that the subjective view of the claimant be rationally grounded in circumstances that a reasonable would share that experience. He found that denial of professional development impacted a significant element of the fundamental right of choice. On the section 1 analysis, Bastarache J considered the positive goals of the provision. He saw merit in having a law that encouraged naturalization and increased the value of citizenship. He further observed that the negative impact of the exclusion was sufficiently small to warrant justification by the valuable objective. ==See also== *Foreign worker *List of Supreme Court of Canada cases ==External links== * Category:Section Fifteen Charter case law Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:2002 in Canadian case law ","title":"Lavoie v Canada"},{"id":"9138272","text":"Richard Gardner may refer to: *Richard Gardner (politician) (1812‚Äì1856), British Member of Parliament for Leicester *Richard Gardner (sport shooter) (born 1938), Zimbabwean sports shooter *Richard N.

Aimed at smart card applications, the algorithm is extremely simple and compact; it can be implemented in just 29 bytes of 8051 machine code. Treyfer has a rather small key size and block size of 64 bits each. All operations are byte-oriented, and there is a single 8√ó8-bit S-box. The S-box is left undefined; the implementation can simply use whatever data is available in memory. In each round, each byte has added to it the S-box value of the sum of a key byte and the previous data byte, then it is rotated left one bit. The design attempts to compensate for the simplicity of this round transformation by using 32 rounds. Due to the simplicity of its key schedule, using the same eight key bytes in each round, Treyfer was one of the first ciphers shown to be susceptible to a slide attack. This cryptanalysis, which is independent of the number of rounds and the choice of S-box, requires 232 known plaintexts and 244 computation time. ==Implementation== A simple implementation of Treyfer can be done as follows: #include #define NUMROUNDS 32 extern uint8_t const Sbox[256]; void treyfer_encrypt(uint8_t text[8], uint8_t const key[8]) { unsigned i; uint8_t t = text[0]; for (i = 0; i < 8*NUMROUNDS; i++) { t += key[i%8]; t = Sbox[t] + text[(i+1)%8]; text[(i+1) % 8] = t = (t << 1)  (t >> 7); /* Rotate left 1 bit */ } } ==See also== * Tiny Encryption Algorithm ==References== * Category:Broken block ciphers ","title":"Treyfer"},{"id":"9138334","text":"Ashure (Turkish: a≈üure) or Noah's pudding is a Turkish dessert porridge that is made of a mixture consisting of grains, fruits, dried fruits and nuts. In Turkey it is served all year around, especially during Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar, as the 10th of Muharrem corresponds to the Day of Ashure. (\\"Ashura\\" is Arabic for \\"tenth\\".) Traditionally, ashure is made in large quantities to commemorate the ark's landing and is distributed to friends, relatives, neighbors, colleagues, classmates, and others, without regard to the recipient's religion or belief system as an offering of peace and love. Ashure was traditionally made and eaten during the colder months of the year due to its heavy and calorie rich nature, but now it is enjoyed year- round. ==Etymology== The word Ashure come from Arabic word Ashura ', meaning 'tenth'. In Turkish tradition, this dish is made mostly on 10th of Muharram or after 10th of Muharram in Islamic Lunar Calendar. The association with Muharram is not only significant in Islamic beliefs, but also pre-Islamic beliefs, with some Semitic stories also referencing this month. Also in Turkish, Ash(A≈ü) represents mixed porridge. It is derived from Persian word \\"Ashur\\" meaning mixing. Evliya √áelebi defines the Ashure in his travelbook, \\"Ashure is a porridge (a≈ü) that should be cooked at the tenth of Muharram.\\" == Ingredients == Ashure porridge does not have a single recipe, as recipes vary between regions and families. Traditionally, it is said to have at least seven ingredients. Some say at least ten ingredients must be used, in keeping with the theme of \\"tenth\\", while Alevis always use twelve. Among these are wheat, barley, rice, white beans, chickpeas, sweetener, dates, pomegranates, beets, dried fruits, and nuts. However, many renditions add orange and lemon peel to add depth to the pudding. Anise seed, sesame seeds, pine nuts, black cumin seeds, prunus mahaleb, pomegranate kernels, pistachios, almonds, walnuts, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and allspice may be used as garnish, and some variations are flavored with anise liqueur, rose water and/or orange blossom water. In most cases, it is vegan, and it is one of the well-known and the most popular vegan desserts in Turkish cuisine. ==History and traditions== In anecdotal history, it is claimed that when Noah's Ark came to rest on Mount Ararat, Noah's family celebrated with a special dish. Since their supplies were nearly exhausted, what was left (primarily grains, dried fruits and the like) was cooked together to form a pudding, what is now called ashure. Turkish families make ashure pudding to commemorate this event. Ashure is distributed to the poor, as well as to neighbors, friends and relatives. The Day of Ashure is an important day in the Muslim year, corresponding to the Mosaic Yom Kippur observed by Jews, and is observed by Muslims world over in honor of the prophet Moses. The Tenth of Muharrem Day of Ashura also marks the end of the Battle of Karbala and is a special day of observance in Shia Islam. Among Turkish and Balkan Sufis (especially Bektashi), the ashure pudding is prepared with special prayers for health, healing, safety, success and spiritual nourishment. Ashure represents many cultures' beliefs, Islamic and pre-Islamic alike, and therefore is celebrated to commemorate many spiritual events believed to have happened on this day; for example, it is believed that: *The prophet Adam was accepted by God because of his repentance. *Noah's ark came to rest and the passengers survived. *The sea was divided, and the nation of Israel was delivered from captivity, while the Pharaoh's army was destroyed. *Jesus was raised to the heavens, etc. *Martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali The Armenian version is called anu≈üabur. Armenians serve it during Christmas and on New Year's Eve. Like ashure it may be garnished with pomegranate seeds and flavored with rose water, and the pudding is shared with neighbors during the Christmas season. The festive pudding is the centerpiece of the New Year's table, which is often decorated with dried fruits, nuts and pomegranates. ==Popular cultureLiterature=== Turkish author Elif ≈ûafak has scenes involving ashure in The Flea Palace and The Bastard of Istanbul. In The Flea Palace ≈ûafak writes, \\"As they boiled there on the stove, all the ingredients prattled on in unison but each in its own language,\\" and in The Bastard of Istanbul Mustafa recalls childhood memories of eating the bowls of dessert he had been entrusted to distribute to his neighbors. == References == == External links == *Annual Noah's Pudding Day Category:Turkish puddings Category:Bulgarian cuisine Category:Macedonian cuisine Category:Fruit dishes Category:Christmas food Category:Armenian cuisine Category:Food and drink in Islam Category:New Year foods ","title":"Ashure"},{"id":"9138339","text":"La √∫ltima noche del mundo (Spanish for the last night of the world) is the debut album by Mexican post-rock band Austin TV.

After spending five years in Peƒá, the family moved to Sarajevo. ==Career== Vuka≈°inoviƒá started drumming simultaneously to his primary schooling in Sarajevo, joining his first band Plavi Dijamanti in 1963 at the age of thirteen. Formed by guitarist Edo Bogeljiƒá, Plavi Dijamanti were an instrumental cover group ‚Äî somewhat of an outdated setup since the city and the rest of Yugoslavia had already been experiencing the surging popularity of the vocalist bands. Mostly playing local high school dance parties, their shining moment came in 1964 at the city's very first gitarijada (battle of the bands) held at the Second Sarajevo Gymnasium ‚Äî a competition they won largely thanks to Vuka≈°inoviƒá's memorable drum solo while covering The Shadows' \\"See You in My Drums\\". Vuka≈°inoviƒá then switched to ƒåiƒçak with Zoran Red≈æiƒá on bass, Mahmut \\"Pa≈°a\\" Feroviƒá on rhythm guitar, and Dragan Daniloviƒá on lead guitar. ƒåiƒçak folded in 1969. During spring 1970, ≈Ωeljko Bebek invited Red≈æiƒá to join his band Kodeksi on club & bar tour in southern Italy since they immediately needed someone to play bass. Red≈æiƒá in turn brought along Vuka≈°inoviƒá as well, since the struggling band that featured future Bijelo Dugme leader Goran Bregoviƒá also needed a replacement drummer. Right after arriving in Italy, Vuka≈°inoviƒá encouraged and eventually convinced his new bandmates to make a turn towards hard rock, similar to the pioneering sound that was coming out of England at the time epitomized by acts like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. The band's new style backfired as they got fired from most of the places they were regularly playing up to that point and eventually returned to Sarajevo. In late summer 1971, 21-year-old Vuka≈°inoviƒá decided to leave for London where he'd end up living for the next three years. Finding musical success in England proved elusive, and he earned a living mostly through menial jobs. Among them, working as a busboy at London's Hard Rock Cafe near Hyde Park Corner. After returning to Sarajevo in late 1974, he joined Indexi, performing with them on several singles. In October 1976, Goran Bregoviƒá offered Vuka≈°inoviƒá the drummer spot in Bijelo Dugme since their regular drummer Ipe Ivandiƒá suddenly got called up for his mandatory military service. Vuka≈°inoviƒá immediately accepted and reportedly got YUD20 million to play on the upcoming studio record and the subsequent tour. He thus appeared on their 1976 album Eto! Ba≈° hoƒáu!, but decided to leave the group in 1977 right after the album tour ended. The same year, 1977, he formed the enthusiastic power trio Vatreni poljubac. In parallel, he started working with Yugoslav commercial folk artists, composing songs for them ‚Äî in 1979 his song \\"Voljela sam, voljela\\" sung by Hanka Paldum became a huge hit.Kako su \\"rokeri\\" pre≈°li kod Cece;B92, 3 April 2013 After recording nine studio albums between 1977 and 1986, Vuka≈°inoviƒá disbanded Vatreni poljubac choosing to pursue a solo career, recording five albums. After the Yugoslav Wars he released two more albums and took part in Bijelo Dugme‚Äôs 2005 farewell tour. In 1997 he entered the Eurovision song contest for Bosnia and Herzegovina with Alma ƒåard≈æiƒá with their song \\"Goodbye\\". Since November 1997 he's been living in Belgrade where he collaborates with fellow musicians. In late 2006, he took part in a brief Vatreni poljubac reunion, the focus of which was a December 29 concert at Belgrade's SKC. After expressing interest to appear as one of the opening acts at the Rolling Stones concert in Belgrade on July 14, 2007, Vuka≈°inoviƒá was booked up until a couple of days before the show. However, at that time a row between him, Stones' management and local concert organizers came to a head and he ended up not playing. In March 2014, Vuka≈°inoviƒá released his ninth solo album entitled Nemoj pjevat'...Ma nemoj. The album was released through City Records. ==Personal life== Born in Belgrade, he moved with his family to Peƒá when he was six years old. In 1963, they moved again, this time to Sarajevo where he spent most of his time until the end of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995.

The term \\"redskin\\" is widely defined by dictionaries as pejorative, and the California State Assembly banned use of the mascot by public schools in September 2015. Principal Nunley defended the term, saying that the school had no history of racism and that the mascot honored natives. State Senator Marty Block described that as a rationalization, and said the term is a racist slur which warrants state intervention. The school had until 2017 to switch, and the district voted in June 2016 to change the name to Tribe.

Mega Bloks, a line of construction set toys, is its most popular product. Its other brands include Mega Construx, Mega Puzzles, Board Dudes and Rose Art. The company distributes a wide range of construction toys, puzzles, and craft-based products. In 2016, Mega Brands' Bloks was second in worldwide sales (11%) of toy construction building sets. ==HistoryRitvik Holdings=== In 1967, Victor Bertrand and his wife Rita founded the company as Ritvik Holdings (RH). Ritvik is a portmanteau word based on a combination of Rita and Victor. RH began by distributing toys made outside Canada and also facilitated contracts between foreign brands and Canadian manufacturers.Mega Bloks Inc. Ritvik later became a vertically integrated company as it expanded by adding plastic injection molding operations, design operations, tooling manufacturers, and marketing services. The company had a leading share of the plastic injection molded market by the early 1980s. Wanting to expand beyond Canada, Victor Bertrand took an interest in construction block sets. He saw room for growth despite them being an industry staple since the early years of the 20th century when the Batima Block was released in Belgium in 1905. With Lego being the leading construction toy, Bertrand chose to make a similar set. Bertrand ignored friends and advisors, feeling he had two advantages in launching Mega Bloks: he aimed to produce jumbo-sized bricks for toddlers, who Lego bricks were not designed for, and he considered his expertise in injection molding would give him a price advantage. At 1984 trade shows, Ritvik showed the Mega Bloks line in the US and Canada. An immediate hit, Mega Bloks had generally large sales in Canada, including a $1 million sale to Toys R Us, and were available almost anywhere in the two markets in 1985. Several multinational companies had made offers just after the trade show for distribution rights, as well as to buy either Mega Bloks or RH itself. By 1989, Mega Bloks were in 30 countries and popular in Europe, the US and Canada. Up to 30 play sets were available. A piano set with Mega Blok-compatible keys for the pre-school market was released in 1988. In 1989, Ritvik sold all of its other toy and plastics lines. A Mega Bloks \\"Micro\\" line was released in 1991; these were compatible with or a clone of Lego bricks. This finally placed Ritvik and The Lego Group in direct competition. Lego Canada soon sued Ritvik for unfair competition, claiming a likelihood of confusion between its Micro Mega Bloks and the Lego line. Since Lego's brick shape patent had expired, the lawsuit dragged on for years as sales grew worldwide (at an average 70% a year until the mid-1990s), but finally Ritvik won the case by clearly distinguishing its brand from Lego. Suits were filed in Europe and the U.S. with similar results. In 1996, a 27% share of Ritvik was sold to the Blackstone Group. Rita Bertrand and her daughter Chantal retired that year, while Marc and Victor Bertrand, Jr. were active in management. Two international subsidiaries were formed, Mega Bloks Latinoamerica S.A. de C.V. in 1997 and Mega Bloks Europe N.V. in 1998. International sales in the 1990s were at 30%, with 70% from Canada and the US; all but 10% were from four major chains: Toys 'R Us, Wal-Mart, Target, and Kmart. Ritvik followed the late 1990s licensing trend in 1998, with its first licensing agreement being for Teletubbies, followed by an agreement with Fisher-Price with its Sesame Street characters license. A NASCAR line was also introduced. Ritvik Toys, Inc. was amalgamated with Ritvik Holdings Inc. on June 30, 1998. Lego, K'Nex and Ritvik added features to their lines in 2000. Ritvik made transformable building sets that changed into vehicles, and a remote control electronic kit named the Mega Bloks RO Action Builder. Ritvik also added TV advertising that year with a $2 million campaign; the company spent $30 million on advertising, marketing, and research and development in 2002. ===Mega Bloks=== With sales having approximately doubled since 1999, Ritvik went public via an initial public offering in May 2002 on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the new name of Mega Bloks Inc. The company traded at $14.50 a share. The founders' sons, Victor Bertrand Jr. and Marc Bertrand, became chief operating officer and chief operating officer/president, respectively, while Victor Sr. remained chairman of the board. The toy market was in a down cycle from 2002 to 2003, with the construction toy segment losing 10 to 15%, but Mega Bloks experienced increased sales. Since 1986, the company had seen a run of 17 years of growth, becoming number two in the construction toy segment behind Lego. In 2003, the company formed a joint venture with the Japanese toy company Bandai for Asia. Bandai marketed Mega Blok sets with their existing licensed Japanese cartoon characters. With the success of movies of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books and J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, a Dragon series was released in 2003. Mega Play!, a block set large enough for children to fit inside, was also launched. With shares trading at almost $30, in 2005 Mega Bloks, Inc. acquired Rose Art Industries, including its Magnetix line of toys, for US$350 million. Soon, Magnetix was a source of lawsuits resulting from choking incidents, causing its share value to drop quickly. Magnetix was then recalled. The company acquired Board Dudes, Inc., makers of Board Dudes posting and marking boards and Locker Dudes locker products, in January 2006, through its Rose Art Industries subsidiary. ===Mega Brands=== On June 15, 2006, following the acquisition of several brand names not associated with construction brick toys, the company again changed its name, this time from Mega Bloks Inc. to Mega Brands Inc. with Rose Art Industries, Inc. being renamed Mega Brands America, Inc. After 23 consecutive years of growing sales and profit, Mega lost $458 million in 2008. Heading towards bankruptcy, the company refinanced. Shares were consolidated 1-for-20, with Fairfax Financial becoming a major partner in the recapitalization. Rose Art was placed on the market in March 2008 as a result of inquiries from the previous owners and others. The former owners of Rose Art, Jeffrey and Lawrence Rosen, offered to purchase it back in April 2008. They then sued company management for insider trading in September 2008, alleging shares were sold prior to the Magnetix recall. Rose Art's base operation was shut down in New Jersey, and in 2010 the company moved its stationery and activities division, with some key employees, to Irvine, California, under new executive Thomas Prichard, a former executive at Crayola, Pixar, and Hasbro. The subsidiary was not sold, and was reintegrated into Mega operations by 2012. On February 28, 2014, it was announced that Mattel, Inc. would acquire Mega Brands Inc. for approximately US$450 million. It became a wholly owned subsidiary of Mattel as of April 20, 2014. Prior to the purchase, Mega and Mattel were partners in adding Mattel brands to Mega \\"Worlds\\" plus a line for Mattel's American Girl that competes with Lego's Friends line. Three years later, on February 10, 2017, Mattel announced that it was introducing Mega Construx, a new sub-brand of construction sets designed for children four and up as well as adult collectors. Construx's first license property line was Pok√©mon, launched in mid-2017. ==Product types== Construction *Bricks ** Mega Bloks - original large size for pre-school ** Mega Bloks micro - Lego compatible bricks * Mega Construx Mega Bloks micro figures do not follow the iconic Lego modular mini figures, instead their figures allow up to 16 articulation points, i.e. poses and customization. ==Pop culture connections== Mega Bloks were featured in a commercial for the Honda Element, in which bricks fell from the sky to assemble the full-sized vehicle. The commercial clearly identifies the bricks as Mega Bloks in the opening moments of the sequence. Mega Brands currently has the licensing rights for Thomas the Tank Engine, video game franchises Call of Duty and Halo, Barbie, Hot Wheels, Power Rangers, American Girl, Monster High, Pok√©mon, Destiny, and used to have the rights for the Despicable Me franchise. Mega Brands picked up the license for Nickelodeon franchises like SpongeBob SquarePants and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles after Lego discontinued carrying their version of the licensed sets. They also have the rights to produce sets based on Nick Jr. properties like Blaze and the Monster Machines and Shimmer and Shine. ==Lego lawsuits== Mega Bloks building block (above) and Lego building brick (below) Mega Brands has won 14 cases launched by competitor Lego regarding its Mega Bloks. The Lego Group has filed lawsuits against Mega Bloks, Inc. in courts around the world on the grounds that Mega Bloks' use of the \\"studs and tubes\\" interlocking brick system is a violation of trademarks held by Lego. Generally such lawsuits have been unsuccessful, chiefly because the functional design of the basic brick is considered a matter of patent rather than trademark law, and all relevant Lego patents have expired. On November 17, 2005, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld Mega Bloks' right to continue selling the product in Canada. A similar decision was reached by the European Union's Court of First Instance on November 12, 2008 when it upheld an EU trademark agency decision following an objection by Mega Bloks against a trademark awarded to Lego in 1999. On September 14, 2010, the European Court of Justice ruled that the 8-peg design of the original Lego brick \\"merely performs a technical function [and] cannot be registered as a trademark\\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:Mattel Category:Companies formerly listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange Category:Companies based in Montreal Category:Toy companies established in 1967 Category:2014 mergers and acquisitions Category:Construction toys Category:Toy companies of Canada Category:1967 establishments in Quebec ","title":"Mega Brands"},{"id":"9138524","text":"JazzTimes is an American magazine devoted to jazz.

The dance is a staple in the Black coastal populations and it celebrates the emancipation of slaves. Festejo is recognized for its high energy and the improvisation carried out by the dancers. Some believe that its origins trace back to competitive dance circles performed by individuals playing caj√≥ns. Despite its African origins, people of all different backgrounds participate in the dance that many regards as one of the greatest representations of Peruvian culture. It is currently performed, in its most traditional form, in San Luis de Ca√±ete and El Carmen District, Chincha (Chincha). == History== There are theories that describe the Festejo as a dance that began in Lima in the mid-17th century, but they do not provide evidence to support these hypotheses. No musical example has yet been established to show that this musical form existed before 1800. However, some Festejos dating from the 19th century have been identified. Since the middle of the 20th century, old Festejos have been collected from the areas of Lima, Aucallama, Ca√±ete and Chincha. According to musicologist William Tompkins, by the early 1900s the original choreography was almost completely lost. It is from 1949, that a standard choreography for the \\"Festejo\\" begins to be generated in the \\"Peruvian Folk Music and Dance School\\" (today the Jos√© Mar√≠a Arguedas National Higher School of Folklore). It is from 1960 that this dance becomes the most widespread musical genre among Afro-Peruvian artists. In large part due to the popularity of the musical works by Jos√© Durand, Victoria Santa Cruz and Nicomedes Santa Cruz. In 1971 the \\"Black Art Festival\\" of Ca√±ete began, which for the first time included a contest where the best dancer is elected \\"Miss Festejo\\". Between 1975 and 1977, a composition contest for Festejo and similar genres was included. It is in this decade that a new style of Festejo is popularized for women that some musicians call \\"valentina style\\", for which they dress in colorful skirts and bras. == Music == The base of every festejo is rhythm, achieved through a series of melodies with the Peruvian caj√≥n, quijada de burro, cajita, conga and bongo. ==References== * Category:Peruvian music Category:Peruvian dances Category:Peruvian culture ","title":"Festejo"},{"id":"9138658","text":"Mar Addai II (; born Shlemun Giwargis () on 1 August 1946 in Iraq) is the incumbent Catholicos-Patriarch of the Ancient Church of the East. He resides in the Apostolic See of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in Baghdad, Iraq.St. Mary's Cathedral, the home of His Holiness Mar Addai II, Patriarch of The Ancient Church of the East, was bombed Sunday morning. == Tenure as Metropolitan == Prior to being elected as Catholicos-Patriarch, Mar Addai II served as Bishop of Baghdad. He was later elevated to the rank of Metropolitan of Iraq in September 1968, after the schism separating the Ancient Church of the East from the Assyrian Church of the East. Together with Mar Aprem Mooken and Mar Poulose Poulose, Mar Addai consecrated Mar Thoma Darmo as the Patriarch of the Ancient Church of the East in October 1968. Mar Thoma Darmo died the following year in September 1969, falling one month short of the first anniversary of his consecration as Catholicos-Patriarch. Mar Addai II was then selected to serve as Acting Patriarch. == Tenure as Catholicos-Patriarch == In December 1969, as Acting Patriarch, Mar Addai II elevated Mar Narsai Toma to Metropolitan of Kirkuk and Mar Toma Eramia as Metropolitan of Mosul and Northern Iraq. He was officially elected to the position of Catholicos- Patriarch in February 1970, several months after the death of Mar Thoma Darmo. Two years later, on 20 February 1972, he was consecrated as Patriarch of the Ancient Church of the East by Mar Narsai and Mar Toma. The ordination took place at St. Zaia Cathedral in Iraq.History of Eastern Christianity (Malayalam) by Dr. Mar Aphrem Metropolitan. The Theological Literature Council, Thiruvalla, Kerala, India === Expansion of the Holy Synod === The Ancient Church of the East has seen many changes during Mar Addai's tenure, namely the consecration of a number of new bishops and metropolitans. Since his elevation to the rank of Patriarch, the church has consecrated the following prelates: Mar Daniel Yakob (Auxiliary Bishop of California), Mar Yacoub Daniel (Metropolitan of Australia and New Zealand), Mar Emmanuel Elia (Bishop of Baghdad - resigned), Timothaus Mar Shallita (Metropolitan of Europe), Mar Zaia Khoshaba (Bishop of Baghdad), Mar Aprem Daweed (Bishop of Duhok - resigned), Mar Mari Emmanuel (Bishop of Australia and New Zealand), and Mar Gewargis Younan (Bishop of Chicago). === Gestures towards reconciliation === Between November and December 1995, Mar Aprem Mooken and Mar Poulose Poulose left the Ancient Church of the East for external reasons, and reunited with the Assyrian Church of the East. Mar Addai II has also shown interest in reuniting the sister churches. A meeting between both Holy Synods is expected in the near future, as the Ancient Church of the East has made gestures towards reconciliation. The most prominent of these is undoubtedly the declaration made in June 2010 in which Mar Addai II announced that the church would officially recognize Christmas on December 25 starting that year, in accordance with the Gregorian calendar. This was a historic move, as calendar issues were one of the primary reasons leading to the schism. Following this decision, some clerics created an autonomous synod. Despite this move, the Holy Synod of the Ancient Church of the East has maintained that they will continue celebrating Easter in accordance with the Julian Calendar. === Advocacy for the rights of Christians in Iraq === On Sunday, 24 September 2006, St. Mary's Cathedral, the home of Mar Addai II, was bombed. The cathedral, located in the Riyadh district of Baghdad, experienced dual bombings: A small improvised explosive device preceded a car detonation setting off a large number of explosives. The bombings occurred within minutes of each other. The bombing was carefully timed to occur just as parishioners exited the church following Sunday morning services. Two civilians were killed in the attacks, in addition to the twenty that sustained injuries.Church Bombings in Iraq The Patriarch was also attacked on another occasion in his own courtyard. Though his life was spared, he was robbed. Mar Addai II's tenure as Patriarch comes at arguably the darkest time for Assyrian Christians since the Assyrian Genocide also known as Seyfo. Mar Addai has stressed the importance of maintaining the Assyrian Christian presence in Iraq. Despite attacks against his life and the threat facing all Christians in the country, he has refused to relocate and continues to reside in Iraq. On 18 May 2007, Mar Addaii II called on the Prime Minister of Iraq and the Iraqi Parliament to put an end to the tragic situation Christians in Iraq were forced to endure as a result of constant threats and assaults against them. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *St Zaia Cathedral NSW, Australia site.

The film was backed by nationalistic figures including Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara and public donations, and was intended to expose what the filmmakers saw as propaganda aspects of the Nanking Massacre. Less than a month before the 70th anniversary of the Nanjing massacre, the director said in an interview that Japanese war criminals were martyrs who were made into scapegoats for war crimes as Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross in order to bear the sins of the world, and they died bearing all of old Japan's good and bad parts. Contrary to the scholarly consensus, he also claimed that the Nanjing Massacre was a politically motivated frame-up by China and the numerous Western eyewitnesses whose accounts form the basis of the historical understanding of the Nanjing Massacre. These accounts were, according to the filmmakers, espionage activities. Mizushima said that the project was meant to counter the film Nanking, a 2007 American documentary, which he believed was \\"based on fabrications and gives a false impression\\" and which he perceives to be a \\"setup by China to control intelligence\\". ==Plot== The Truth about Nanjing is a three-part film. * The first section was \\"Seven condemned criminals\\" (The theme is Class A war criminals.)

At that time, it paid the largest estate tax in Missouri. The estate par value was over $1.2 million in 1921. Eleven nephews and nieces contested the will, from both the Geist family and the Van Raalte family. They claimed that Rosa had poisoned the mind of Jacob against them. She offered the nephews and nieces $50,000 to share if they would not litigate, but they went ahead with the lawsuit. In the end, Rosa Lampert prevailed, and won the entire amount. There were dozens of articles in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper about the trial, including front page articles. Rosa Lampert married and became Rosa Lampert Graff.

The \\"U.S. Field Artillery March\\" is a patriotic military march of the United States Army written in 1917 by John Philip Sousa, based on an earlier work by Edmund L. Gruber. The refrain is the \\"Caissons Go Rolling Along\\". This song inspired the official song of the U.S. Army which is called \\"The Army Goes Rolling Along\\". ==Background== Sousa served in the United States Marine Corps, and was a member of the U.S. Navy during World War I. He was asked by Army Lieutenant George Friedlander, of the 306th Field Artillery, to compose a march for his regiment. Friedlander suggested it be built around a song already known as The Caisson Song (alternatively The Field Artillery Song or The Caissons Go Rolling Along). The song was thought to perhaps be of Civil War origin, and was unpublished, and its composer believed to be dead. Sousa agreed, changed the harmonic structure, set it in a different key, refined the melody, made the rhythm more snappy, and added further new material.Marshall's Civic BandBierly, Paul. The Works of John Philip Sousa, pp. 93-94 (Integrity Press, 1984). Sousa and Lieutenant Friedlander were surprised to later learn that the composer of The Caisson Song was still living and that the song had been written in 1908 by artillery First Lieutenant (later Brigadier General) Edmund L. Gruber, with some help on the lyrics from Lieutenant William Bryden, and Lieutenant (later Major General) Robert M. Danford, while stationed at Fort Stotsenburg in the Philippines.The Field Artillery Journal, July‚ÄìAugust 1926, pp. 337 and 443-444, background and original lyrics Reportedly, Gruber may have been influenced by music composed by Alfred C. Montin at Fort Sheridan in Illinois, shortly before his unit was transferred to Fort Sill in Oklahoma.\\"In Years Past\\", The Post-Journal (July 29, 2014). It appears that Gruber did not object to Sousa's use of the song, at least not initially, and that Sousa passed on his royalties to Gruber.Wigginton, F. Peter, Soldiers magazine, July 1994, p. 45 However, other sources state that Gruber became involved in a prolonged legal battle to recover the rights to the music he had written and that had been lifted (unknowingly or not) by Sousa and widely sold by sheet music publishers who reaped profits while Gruber received nothing. The music became so popular that it was also used in radio ads by firms such as the Hoover Vacuum Company. Gruber's position was rejected by the courts, which ruled that he had waited too long to complain and that his music was by that time in the public domain.EGNER v. E. C.

Son of Fulcoald of Rouergue and Senegund, daughter of Alda, sister of William of Gellone, Fredelo was related to the families of the counts of Rouergue and Toulouse. In 840, Fulcoald died, but Fredelo was not confirmed as his successor in Rouergue. But when Bernard of Septimania was captured by Charles the Bald for rebellion against his lord and executed in 844, the king bestowed his county of Toulouse on Fredelo. Pepin II of Aquitaine, who was leading the revolt against Charles, appointed Bernard's heir William to the county of Toulouse. Of the two claimants to Toulouse, William had the upper hand. In 849, however, William was in Barcelona and Charles invaded Aquitaine. Fredelo, then in control of Toulouse, taking advantage of William's absence, opened the gates of the city to his sovereign and was reconfirmed in his possession of it. Fredelo received the County of Carcassonne in 850 and died in 852, leaving his titles to his brother Raymond.

His family seat was N√©met√∫jv√°r in western Hungary (now G√ºssing in Austria). The Batthy√°ny family traces its roots as far back as the founding of Hungary by √Årp√°d in the year 896, its ancestor being one of seven princes called Urs. On 14 December 1828 Batthy√°ny married Wilhelmine von Ahrenfeld, widow of Ferdinand, Graf Bubna von Littitz (died 1825), and some twelve years older than Batthy√°ny. This came two years after the birth of their first son, Edmund, and two months after the birth of their second, but it had the effect of legitimating them both. His wife died in 1840.Almanach de Gotha (1877), p. 216 In 1838 Batthy√°ny donated his entire library, including the mysterious Rohonc Codex, to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. While still a young man Batthy√°ny emigrated to England, where he became well known as an owner and breeder of Thoroughbred racehorses. In 1843 he established his own stud. Batthy√°ny was involved in the Magyar national movement as a member of the constitutional Hungarian Ministry of 1848 led by his cousin Lajos Batthy√°ny. In 1851 he signed a letter together with Count K√°zm√©r Batthy√°ny, Bertalan Szemere, and Prince Paul Esterh√°zy to his old friends, the Duke of Wellington and Lord Melbourne, accusing Lajos Kossuth of high treason and terrorism.\\"Prince Esterh√°zy and the Hungarian Government of 1848\\", The Times (November 13, 1851). This letter exposed the divisions in the Magyar national movement to English supporters.Conference on British-Hungarian Relations since 1848 (PDF) In 1859 Batthy√°ny was elected to the Jockey Club. He hired the trainer John Dawson to condition his horses at Newmarket. In 1875 his horse Galopin won The Derby and went on to be the Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1888, 1889 and 1898. Galopin was the damsire of Bayardo and of the 1886 U.K. Triple Crown Champion, Flying Fox. Philip, 4th Prince Batthyany- Strattmann (1781‚Äì1870) In 1870 Batthy√°ny's second cousin Philipp, 4th Prince Batthy√°ny-Strattmann, died without children, and Batthy√°ny succeeded as the 5th Prince Batthy√°ny-Strattmann. At about this time he presented a small life- boat called Harbinger to the boatmen of Bridlington.Sarah Stocks, Count Gustave Batthyany: Miscellaneous Items on Count Gustav Batthyany and Harbinger Lifeboat (2003), pp. 3‚Äì10 Batthyany had a heart condition that enforced the early retirement of his horse Galopin at the end of the 1875 season, as it was feared that the excitement of watching him race again could put the Prince's life at risk.Ahnert, Rainer L.

The tower is tall and contains upscale commercial space at street level, such as Safi and D'Oro Caffe. The tower's main lobby consists of three stories, followed by the Park Suites, which are condos customly furnished by the Rockwell Group, on floors 4 through 9. The two-story tenth and twelfth floors contain hotel-esque amenities available to the tower's residents. Ascending floors contain all condos. The tower's architecture is based on the Miami Modern (abbreviated as MiMo) style, and has many design features that pay tribute to landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx's emphasis on natural aesthetics seen along the bay. The site where 50 Biscayne stands today was formerly home to the Columbus Bazaar, a shopping mall which replaced The Hotel McAllister and the Columbus Hotel in a quick fix effort to reutilize the land when both establishments closed for business. The McAllister Hotel was considered one of the city's earliest high-rises when constructed in 1917, while the taller Columbus Hotel sported a top story restaurant (called Top O' The Columbus) and retail arcade. ==Gallery== Image:50biscaynefountain.jpg50 Biscayne while under construction in early 2007, left is the One Biscayne Tower Image:Biscayne Wall 20080510.jpg50 Biscayne and neighboring skyscrapers along the Biscayne Wall Image:50 Biscayne Tower from bay.jpgSeen from the bay along with the New World Tower Image:50-Biscayne.jpgSeen from Bayfront Park File:Biscayne Towers.jpg50 Biscayne with One Biscayne Tower in February 2020 ==See also== *List of tallest buildings in Miami * List of tallest buildings in Florida ==External links== *Emporis - 50 Biscayne Category:Residential buildings completed in 2007 Category:Residential condominiums in Miami Category:Residential skyscrapers in Miami Category:2007 establishments in Florida ","title":"50 Biscayne"},{"id":"9139139","text":"Michele Mitchell (May 24, 1970) is an American filmmaker, journalist and author best known for her on-camera reporting for PBS and CNN Headline News and her documentaries Haiti: Where Did the Money Go? (PBS, 2013) and The Uncondemned (2017). == Early life == She grew up in Yorba Linda, California, and attended Esperanza High School, where she ran track and cross country, and wrote for the school newspaper and the youth section of The Los Angeles Times. She attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where she earned a BSJ and MSJ in 1992. Throughout college, she wrote for the sports section of the Chicago Tribune and was a member of Delta Zeta sorority. Her first job was on Capitol Hill, where she was the youngest congressional communications director, for Rep. Pete Geren (D-TX), who became the Secretary of the Army for Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. == Journalism career == Her journalism career began during the height of the \\"Generation X\\" political trend, which she wrote about in 1998 in her first book, A New Kind of Party Animal: How the Young Are Changing Politics As Usual (Simon & Schuster). The book led to a job at CNN Headline News as a political analyst for the 2000 election. In 2001, she became the political anchor at Headline News, covering daily political stories and, post-9/11, she filed one of the last interviews given by the mujahideen Abdul Haq. She particularly emphasized the Patriot Act, which earned her the verbal disdain of Attorney General John Ashcroft's staff and frequent appearances on Politically Incorrect. She left Headline News in 2003 after her second novel was published, but returned to television on Now with Bill Moyers on PBS. There, she filed investigative stories on the war on terror, vote fraud, women and the economy, and the Abramoff scandal. == Haiti: Where Did the Money Go? == In 2010, she began working on her own web series, tracking what happened to the money donated by private US citizens to major US charities after the earthquake in Haiti. The Haiti: Where Did the Money Go? web series debuted on social media in January 2011. She then produced and directed a television documentary, also called Haiti: Where Did the Money Go?, which was made into a film in 2012. The film, which aired over 1,000 times in the United States on PBS stations generated controversy, when the American Red Cross attacked it as \\"inaccurate.\\" However, the film was widely embraced, both critically and by the Haitian community, activists, aid workers and Members of Congress. In 2013, the film won many awards, including a Gracie Award for Outstanding Investigative Program, a CINE Golden Eagle, a CINE Special Jury Award for Best Investigative Documentary, and the 2013 National Edward R. Murrow Award for Best TV Documentary. It was also screened at the 2013 Miami Women's International Film Festival where it won Best Documentary Short. == The Uncondemned == In 2013, she began filming The Uncondemned with co-director Nick Louvel, a documentary about the first time rape was prosecuted as a war crime during the Rwanda genocide. On September 24, 2015, just a month before The Uncondemned was set to be screened at the Hamptons International Film Festival, co-director Louvel was killed in a single-car accident hours after hand-delivering the film to the festival.https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/09/rwanda-genocide- documentary-uncondemned-filmmaker-death In June 2016, the final cut of the film made its debut at the New York Human Rights Watch Film Festival. The following October, the documentary was selected by the Hamptons International Film Festival to make its world premiere. Here, it was aired in front of 700 people at the United Nations, hosted by the UN Special Representative for Rape in Conflict Zainab Bangura.

In July 2016, the Mechanism began investigating Mitchell for contempt of court.

For the Russian spy, see Earl Edwin Pitts. Earl Pitts is a fictional character performed by Gary Burbank, a radio personality from Cincinnati, Ohio in 1968. Pitts, who is almost always referred to as \\"Earl Pitts, Uhmerikun\\" (as in \\"American\\") is a stereotype of a redneck from the Southern United States. As such, Pitts presents a daily \\"editorial,\\" which always begins with a bugle call of \\"Assembly\\", and the words, \\"Ya' know what makes me sick?\\" followed by another line like, \\"You know what makes me so angry, ah just want to soak mah butt in a bucket of toxic waste?\\" Pitts then goes off on a rant, either about some cultural topic of the day as seen from a redneck point of view, or an anecdote about his home life or his job at the local tavern. His family and friends‚Äîwife Pearl, son Earl Junior, daughter Sandra Dee, and good friend Dub Meeker, among others‚Äîfigure prominently in many routines. His signature ending lines are \\"Wake Up, Uhmerika!\\" and \\"Ah'm Earl Pitts, Uhmerikun. Pitts off!\\" while \\"The Washington Post\\" march plays in the background. Burbank, whose radio career has taken him from his native Memphis to his 20-year-plus gig working afternoon drive time at WLW-AM in Cincinnati (and briefly in national syndication), began the Pitts character shortly after arriving at WLW. The daily routines became an instant hit, and a few years later Pitts' commentaries were syndicated nationally. Earl Pitts now is heard on about 200 stations and via XM Satellite Radio's WLW simulcast. Burbank says that Pitts is the second-longest running syndicated comedy program ever behind Paul Harvey News and Comment. Harvey's program was neither a comedy program nor syndicated; it was a network program heard on ABC Radio Networks for its entire 58-year run, and at least two national comedy shows date to before the introduction of Pitts', both launching nationwide in 1974: Dr. Demento, which syndicated until 2010, and A Prairie Home Companion, a comedy-centric variety series that has run continuously. As both of those shows are weekly series, the Pitts monologues, airing five episodes a week, have more episodes. Earl's Web site features items for sale including purchase rights to previous monologues. Ostensibly, hearing the program online requires a subscription to the Pitts Web site. However, many stations stream the program at a regular time, and in addition, WFLA in Tampa, Florida offers a daily podcast of the show.Earl Pitts podcastsite:spreaker.com/user/9808913/earl-pitts Despite Burbank's retirement as a host of WLW, the daily Pitts commentaries continue, and have recently expanded into television. Burbank taped several 90-second \\"commentaries\\" as Pitts to be seen on WGN America and possibly other stations owned by Tribune Company. The spots were done at the behest of Burbank's old boss at WLW, and were taped at a pub in Fort Thomas, Kentucky. ==Character background== Very little has been written seriously about Pitts's home and family life; most written references contain little but nonsense. However, Pitts does frequently mention such information in his monologues. He is of indeterminate middle age and is unhappily married to his wife of twenty-five years, Pearl, with whom he has two children: his son, Earl Jr., whose age varies between teen years and early 20s and who frequently comes to his father for advice, and his teenage daughter Sandra Dee (named after, but no relation to the actress of the same name), who is noted for her presumed ugliness and is more of a nuisance. He has a little-mentioned brother, Merle Pitts. Earl has a day job as an automotive worker and a night job as a bartender at the Duck Inn, a local tavern. His experiences and interactions with the bar patrons serve as fodder for many of his monologues. He claims to be a cousin of actor Brad Pitt.https://earlpittsamerican.com/marrying-a-pitts-man/ Earl's hometown is not explicitly stated in most cases; Pitts himself states that he hails from Water Valley, Mississippi but tries to sound like he comes from a generic small town near the listener\\"Earl Pitts and Gary Burbank fishing with Kentucky Afield.\\" Kentucky Afield. Retrieved 2011-03-26.‚Äîfor instance, KERN in Bakersfield, California, a Pitts affiliate, claimed Pitts to be from nearby Oildale, and KSCS in Arlington, Texas claimed for many years he was the former mayor of Gun Barrel City, Texas.https://web.archive.org/web/20050213120659/http://www.kernradio.com/showdj.asp?DJID=10466 Earl's website states he spent many, if not all, of his early years in Rooster Ear, Mississippi, a town that does not exist in real life. ==See also== *Gilbert Gnarley ==References== ==External links== *Earl Pitts and Gary Burbank Show Official site Category:Radio characters introduced in 1968 Category:Male characters in radio Category:Fictional characters from Cincinnati Category:Fictional characters from Mississippi ","title":"Earl Pitts (character)"},{"id":"9139273","text":"Harold John Daub Jr. (born April 23, 1941) is an American lawyer and politician from Nebraska who served four terms in the United States House of Representatives and as the 54th Mayor of Omaha, Nebraska.

He ran for the United States House of Representatives in the Omaha-based 2nd congressional district in 1978, losing to incumbent Democrat John J. Cavanaugh III. Cavanaugh declined to run for re- election in 1980 and Daub ran for the seat again, defeating Democrat Richard Fellman.\\"Election 80‚ÄîNew Faces in the House\\". Washington Post. November 23, 1980. Retrieved June 30, 2017. Daub was reelected three times, in 1982, 1984, and 1986. In March 1987, Nebraska's senior U.S. Senator Edward Zorinsky, a Democrat, died of a heart attack and Governor Kay A. Orr appointed businessman David Karnes to fill the seat. Daub challenged Karnes in the Republican primary for election to a full term in the Senate in 1988, but lost by nine points to Karnes, who then lost the general election to former Democratic Governor Bob Kerrey. In 1990, Daub challenged the state's other Democratic senator, J. James Exon, for reelection, easily winning the Republican nomination, but losing the general election by a substantial margin to Exon. In 1995, Daub won a special election for Mayor of Omaha following the resignation of Mayor P.J. Morgan, and was narrowly elected to a full term in 1997, both times defeating city councilwoman Brenda Council. In 2001, he was defeated for reelection by insurance executive Mike Fahey in a close race. Daub then served as a member of the Social Security Advisory Board from 2002 to 2006 and joined Missouri-based law firm Blackwell Sanders Peper Martin LLP (now Husch Blackwell) in 2005. In 2007, Daub briefly ran for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Senator Chuck Hagel; he exited the race to offer an early endorsement to Mike Johanns, former Nebraska governor and USDA secretary, who won the seat.\\"Hal Daub exits Senate race\\", Omaha.com, Retrieved September 29, 2007 In 2008, Daub announced he was running again for Mayor of Omaha in the 2009 election.

The use of focus mitts is said to have came about as Muay Thai and Far Eastern martial arts made its way toward the United States in the late 1700s. The concept first began with using foot tongs or slippers on hands to absorb the impact from kicks and strikes. Modern day punch mitts came into more widespread use in the mid-1960s when Bruce Lee was seen using them in his training routines. Although they have been around for decades, they were never a central part of coaching until the late ‚Äò70s and early ‚Äò80s. Now they‚Äôve become an almost irreplaceable part of a fighter‚Äôs routine. The person holding the focus mitts will typically call out combinations and \\"feed\\" the puncher good counter-force while maneuvering and working specific skills. Focus mitts are often used as an augment to sparring, with more explicit focus on the puncher than the feeder, especially to develop good punch combinations and defensive maneuvers such as \\"slipping,\\" \\"bobbing\\" and \\"weaving.\\" When wearing focus mitts it is important not merely to hold them but to actively \\"feed\\" them into the punches, to balance their force and prevent injury to both parties. Similar to a focus mitt but designed for different purposes are heavier Thai pads used in muay Thai boxing and MMA, kicking shields, body shields and uppercut shields used in a variety of martial arts to help gauge distance and practice techniques with kicks, knees, elbows and uppercuts. ==Working with focus mitts== It is often said that holding focus mitts can be as taxing as striking them. Typically, the person wearing the focus mitts will yell a number that represents a combination. For example, yelling \\"three!\\" might signify that the striker should throw a jab, followed by a cross, followed by a hook in rapid succession. Defensive maneuvers are often incorporated into the combinations as well. Improving punching technique relies upon the person wearing the focus mitts knowing where to set his/her hands, as well as knowing how to time the movement of the focus mitts. Typically the holder will comment on how the striker can improve his/her technique between combinations. ==See also== *Sting Sports ==References== ==External links== Category:Combat sports Category:Martial arts equipment Category:Terminology used in multiple sports Category:Boxing terminology Category:Kickboxing terminology Category:Martial arts terminology ","title":"Focus mitt"},{"id":"9139415","text":"Shri Guruji Gobind Singhji Institute of Engineering and Technology (SGGSIET), Nanded, is a college established in 1981.

After one of their rockets carrying wasps malfunctions and goes off course, a computer calculates that the rocket is likely to land somewhere off the coast of Africa. Some time later, in a remote part of Africa, Dr. Lorentz and his daughter Lorna perform an autopsy on a native and determine that he died of paralysis of the nerve centers caused by an injection of a massive amount of venom. Arobi, Lorentz's African assistant, then informs him that a monster is believed to be terrorizing people and animals in an area known as Green Hell. Several months later, Brady reads a newspaper account of turmoil in Central Africa caused by gigantic monsters and surmises that the wasps in the missing rocket were exposed to huge amounts of cosmic radiation because an earlier, minimal overexposure had resulted in the birth of a spider crab twice the size of its mother. Brady and Morgan request a leave of absence from Washington and head for Africa to investigate. In Libreville, equatorial Africa, the territorial agent makes plans for them to travel to meet Dr. Lorentz. Once the safari is ready, Mahri, an Arab, leads Brady and Morgan on the four-hundred mile trek to Lorentz's hospital. The safari battles brush fires, fever, drought and storms, eventually reaching the Lorentz compound where Lorna informs them that her father has not returned from a journey to Green Hell. Later, Arobi arrives with the news that Lorentz has been killed by a monster living in the cauldron of a volcano and gives Brady a giant stinger that he removed from the doctor's shoulder. After Brady analyzes the stinger, he confirms that it belongs to a giant, deadly wasp. Although Brady advises Lorna to stay at the hospital, she insists on accompanying him, Morgan, Mahri and Arobi to Green Hell. When the native bearers learn of the destination, they desert, and although Lorna is able to shame several local villagers into helping, they, too, run off when the group comes upon a deserted native village littered with dead bodies. After Brady expresses his concern that the insects may be multiplying rapidly and could eventually overrun all of Africa, he states that they must destroy the queen and her immediate colony. Brady then explains to Mahri that he has brought small grenade-like bombs, filled with a special explosive, to use against the monsters. As they move closer to the base of the volcano, which shows signs of an imminent eruption, they hear a very loud, buzzing sound. When Brady looks down from a ridge above the volcano, he finds the queen wasp and several gigantic workers. The four men toss grenades into the bowl, but the explosions only serve to anger the wasps. Lorna and the men are pursued by one of the wasps, the size of a large building, but hide in a cave that it cannot enter. The group escapes through another entrance and, just as they emerge, the volcano erupts, spewing massive lava flows that destroy all the wasps in the conflagration. Morgan then notes that nature has a way of destroying its mistakes. ==Cast== *Jim Davis as Dr. Quent Brady *Robert Griffin as Dan Morgan *Joel Fluellen as Arobi *Barbara Turner as Lorna Lorentz *Eduardo Ciannelli as Mahri *Vladimir Sokoloff as Dr. Lorentz == Production and reception == Monster from Green Hell contains stock footage from the 1939 film Stanley and Livingstone.

The current association includes 30 member agencies that provide supports to residents of their local geographic neighbourhoods, including social services, opportunities for association and enabling collective action to improve community conditions. Based on an historic \\"settlement house\\" model, these modern neighbourhood centres hold great promise for revitalizing community in a global era (see Yan, Miu Chung \\"Bridging the Fragmented Community: Revitalizing Settlement Houses in the Global Era\\", 2004 in Journal of Community PracticeVolume: 12 Issue: 1/2). The TNC was founded in 1998, emerging from a previous network named \\"TANS\\" ‚Äì Toronto Association of Neighbourhood Services. TANS was established in the early 1950s as an association of six (and later seven) multi-service settlement houses located in the former City of Toronto. The first settlement houses were established in Toronto between 1894 and 1914, and included Fred Victor Centre (1894), University Settlement Recreation Centre (1910), Central Neighbourhood House (1911) and St. Christopher House (1912). All of these organizations are still active members of the current Toronto Neighbourhood Centres association. The settlement movement began in 1883 with the establishment of the first settlement house, Toynbee Hall in London, England. == Further reading == * Addams, J.

Darby Lux I (1695‚Äì1750) was a mariner, merchant, and Justice of Baltimore County, Maryland. The son of an English clergyman, was born in Kenton Parish, Devonshire, England, on June 15, 1695. He was christened on June 30, 1696, in Kenton. Darby immigrated in the early 1720s and settled in Anne Arundel County. He was a mariner by occupation from 1720‚Äì1742. ==Marriage== Lux married Ann Saunders (1700‚Äì1785) on May 16, 1722. Ann was born May 16, 1700, and died October 30, 1784. Ann was the daughter of Robert Saunders (d. 1755) and Rebeckath Groom (d. 1752). ==Career== Baltimore in 1752. Engraved in 1851 by William Strickland, from contemporary sketch by John Moale (1731‚Äì1798) Lux became a member of the South River Club and was termed a gentleman by 1743. After the Transportation Act of 1718, Lux became involved in penal transportation. He commanded several ships contracted by Jonathan Forward to transport convicted felons (women, men, and children) from London to Maryland, where they were sold as convict bond servants for 7 or 14 years of labor. These ships included: Gilbert, 1721 & 1722; Jonathan, 1723; Patapsco Merchant, 1729, 1730, 1731, 1732, 1733, 1734, & 1735; and Genoa, 1738. (An earlier voyage of the ship Genoa, 1736, was captained by Lux's brother Capt. Francis Lux.) Typical of Lux's convict transport voyages was the \\"Patapsco Merchant\\", which arrived in Baltimore, Maryland, on March 17, 1730, with 106 prisoners from the Newgate Prison, London, Middlesex Co., England. Of the estimated 50,000 convicts transported to the British colonies, Lux carried at least 1,000 from London to Maryland on eleven voyages within seventeen years. Lux carried return cargos of tobacco on board his ships bound for Great Britain and on general consignment to Jonathan Forward, merchant of London. Retiring from the sea, Lux moved to Baltimore Town in 1743 and became a prominent merchant. Lux acted as legal representative in Maryland for mariners and for London merchants, including Jonathan Forward and James Forward of London. As a merchant, Lux imported goods from England and the Caribbean (and exported Maryland products) from his wharf on Light Street in Baltimore Town. Light Street was named in his honor (Lux is Latin for light). After his death, his son Capt. William Lux, Sr. took over and expanded his father's business by acquiring a rope walk. Lux owned the ship \\"Baltimore Town\\", the first Baltimore owned ship to sail from that port. In 1733, he sailed to London aboard the sloop \\"Baltimore Town\\", which carried twenty guns and a crew of forty. His house, located at 43-44 Light Street, and his ship are shown in the contemporary sketch \\"Baltimore In 1752\\", painted by Lt. Col. John Moale, Jr., Esq. (1731‚Äì1798), in 1752, and engraved in 1817 by William Strickland. Lux was a vestryman of St. Paul‚Äôs Parish and was a Commissioner of Baltimore town from 1744‚Äì1747, and again in 1750. He was also a Justice in Baltimore County, Maryland, and at the same time served as a delegate of the Lower House of the General Assembly from 1749‚Äì1750.Edward C.

Lux died October 14, 1750, of pleurisy, in his 53rd year, having served as a Magistrate and Representative of Baltimore County. At this time, Darby had accumulated of land in Baltimore, Frederick, and Dorchester counties, plus 2 lots in Baltimore Town (#43 & #44). Included in this were: of \\"Mactington\\"; of \\"Derbyshire\\"; of \\"Groome‚Äôs Chance\\"; and \\"Lux‚Äôs Conveniency\\". His estate was valued at 555.9.1 pounds sterling, 3,489.16.0 pounds current money, and 1,683 pounds of tobacco, including 4 servants, 11 slaves, \\"sundry European goods\\", books, the sloop \\"Baltimore Town\\", the schooner \\"Polly\\", and a vessel under construction. Lux's will specified equal distribution of his slaves, with one exception: no slave was to be given to his daughter Elizabeth Lux Bowley, or to her son Daniel Bowley II (1745‚Äì1807), because she had already received a wedding gift of one enslaved woman and one enslaved boy.Gibb, Carson. \\"Abstracts of Wills\\", Prerogative Court, MSAS538, Liber 27, 1748-1750 . ==Children== 1\\\\.

A Democrat, she last represented the 27th Senate District, which encompasses the Conejo Valley, and portions of the San Fernando and Santa Clarita Valleys. Due to term limits in California, Senator Pavley completed her legislative career in 2016. She is currently working as the Environmental Policy Director for the USC Schwarzenegger Institute. Before being elected to the State Senate in 2008, Pavley served in the California State Assembly, representing the 41st Assembly District. She was also the first Mayor of Agoura Hills. She was a middle school teacher for 29 years. Pavley is known for her pioneering work on environmental and climate change legislation. She was an author of AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which created a multi-sector emissions reduction target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and a cap-and-trade system. In 2016, she cemented her legacy by authoring and passing SB 32, which extended California's emissions reduction goals to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. ==Background== Senator Fran Pavley is a native Angeleno and grew up in Sherman Oaks. She has lived in Agoura Hills with her husband, Andy, for over 40 years, where they raised their two children, as well as four guide dogs. She received her master's degree in Environmental Planning at CSU Northridge, taught middle school for 29 years and completed her teaching career in Moorpark. In 1982, Senator Pavley became the first mayor of the City of Agoura Hills, and served four terms on the city council. In 2000, she was elected to the California State Assembly where she served three terms. ==Local politics== During Pavley's time as Mayor, she founded the \\"Disaster Response Team,\\" authored the city's \\"Transit Needs Study,\\" and helped her city establish a new community center and gym as well as an equestrian facility.

Pavley was a member of the Assembly Budget Committee, the Education Committee, the Transportation Committee, and the Water, Parks and Wildlife Committee. She was the Chair of the Budget Committee on Resources.http://www.maplight.org/map/ca/legislator/51 ===Legislation=== During her 14 years as a legislator, Pavley authored three major climate-change bills to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in California. In 2016, Governor Jerry Brown signed Pavley's SB 32, establishing a target to reduce GHG emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/15-16/bill/sen/sb_0001-0050/sb_32_bill_20160908_chaptered.pdf The law extended and expanded upon AB 32, which Pavley co-authored in 2006 and was signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, that required a reduction in GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. During her first term in the Assembly, Pavley authored AB 1493, requiring a reduction in GHG emissions from vehicle tailpipes, signed by Governor Gray Davis in 2002. In 2010 President Barack Obama implemented national clean car standards, modeled on AB 1493, also widely known as the \\"Pavley law.\\" During a special ceremony in the White House Rose Garden, the President personally thanked Senator Pavley for her work on creating a clean, safe, secure energy future for California and the United States. Some of Senator Pavley's legislative victories in the Senate included authoring laws establishing California's first statewide regulation of groundwater basins (SB 1168, SGMA) and SB 1425, the water-energy nexus law that measures the carbon intensity in the movement and treating of water;http://groundwater.ca.gov/legislation.cfm stiffening penalties for mortgage fraud; banning lead and cadmium in children's jewelry; implementing California's first regulations for oil and gas well stimulation techniques like fracking and acidizing; and setting new safety standards for gas storage wells in response to the massive gas leak at Porter Ranch, Los Angeles in her district. ==State Senate== Pavley was elected to the 23rd State Senate District in 2008 by a wide margin. In 2012, redistricting changed the legislative boundaries and she ran in the 27th State Senate District in 2012. In the Senate, Pavley served as chair of the Senate Natural Resources and Water Committee. In addition, Senator Pavley was a member of the following Senate committees: Health, Energy, Utilities and Communications; Transportation and Housing, as well as Environmental Quality. She also chaired a Select Committee on Climate Change and AB 32 Implementation, and served on the Select Committee on Autism. ==Climate policy== Pavley's role in establishing California's nation-leading policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions led syndicated columnist Joe Mathews to describe her in 2016 as \\"the mother of California climate change policy.\\" Following passage of California's clean car law in 2002, which was later adopted by 13 other states, Pavley was named by Governing magazine as one of the United States' top public officials of the year. She traveled broadly nationally and internationally to speak on climate policy, and was a member of the California delegation attending UN Climate Conferences in Copenhagen in 2009 and Paris in 2015. As the end of her final term in the Legislature approached, former Governor Gray Davis told CALmatters that she would be nearly impossible to replace as an environmental leader. \\"That's like saying, 'Who's going to be the next Babe Ruth or the next Steve Jobs?'\\" Davis said. \\"We're talking Olympian stature here with Fran.\\" ==2017-Present== Fran Pavley currently serves as the Environmental Policy Director of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute. She has also been appointed to the Wildlife Conservation Board and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Board. In addition, she continues to work with other advocates on the construction of a wildlife crossing over the busy 101 freeway.

In 1974, Sterling School was faced with closure and a small group of faculty launched the educational model that became Sterling College. In 1974, a small group of faculty established an academic year-long program similar to Outward Bound programs known as Grassroots Project in Vermont at Sterling Institute. By 1983, Sterling had developed into an accredited college offering an Associate of Arts degree in resource management with full accreditation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges granted in 1987. Since 1997, Sterling College has been accredited as a four-year college. It awards Bachelor of Arts degrees in Ecology, Environmental Humanities, Outdoor Education, and Sustainable Agriculture & Food Systems. Sterling College joined the Work Colleges Consortium in 1999.

He was the first president of the Clifton Chess Club, and publisher of a book of games from the Divan Club. His most notable result was at the 1851 London tournament, in which he defeated the celebrated British player Howard Staunton in the play-off for third place. He was accused by Staunton of taking an average of 2¬Ω hours per move during some matches, a strategy thought to cause opponents to lose their focus on the match. According to Staunton, following a particularly dilatory performance by Williams in the London 1851 tournament, a 20-minute per turn time limit was adopted for standard play the next year. However other sources contradict this viewpoint and indeed it was not uncommon for Staunton to attribute his losses to the intolerable dilatory play of his opponents. Staunton is quoted as remarking while playing against Williams, \\"... Elijah, you're not just supposed to sit there ‚Äì you're supposed to sit there and think!\\" In The Complete Chess Addict by Mike Fox and Richard James he was dubbed \\"the Bristol Sloth\\" due to his alleged extreme slowness. This sobriquet inspired a musical tune \\"The Bristol Sloth\\" by guitarist Leo Kottke (who also applied the term 'sitzkrieg' in describing Williams' playing style). Williams died in London, a victim of the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak. ==References== *http://www.chessit.co.uk/Centenary/History/1982%20-%2075th/history/1982/bristolclifton.html *https://web.archive.org/web/20091028033153/http://www.geocities.com/siliconvalley/lab/7378/history.txt *https://web.archive.org/web/20080627120750/http://www.chesshistory.com/winter/extra/staunton.html *Fox and James, The Even More Complete Chess Addict Faber and Faber. * ==External links== * Category:1809 births Category:1854 deaths Category:British chess players Category:19th-century chess players ","title":"Elijah Williams (chess player)"},{"id":"9139719","text":"Gustavo M√©ndez (born November 24, 1967) is a football (soccer) referee from Uruguay, best known for supervising two matches at the Copa Am√©rica 2004 in Peru.

He was heard daily on WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio, from June 15, 1981 until December 21, 2007, when he signed off for the last time. ==Radio career== Burbank began his radio career in his hometown at WMPS in the mid 1960s, where he was known on the air as Johnny Apollo. He continued to use that name in 1967 and early 1968 at WWUN (Jackson, Mississippi). In 1968 he moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where he became an instant hit on WAKY- AM. It was at WAKY that Billy Purser officially became Gary Burbank, a name taken from radio and television legend Gary Owens, who as a regular on Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In would announce that he was broadcasting from \\"beautiful downtown Burbank.\\" (Burbank's natural voice is remarkably similar to Owens' on-air voice, and Owens contributed announcements to Burbank's programs in later years.) Burbank left WAKY in 1973; his final program there was an elaborate prank in which he pretended to be fatally shot by a disgruntled listener. At that point, he moved to New Orleans for a brief stint as program director of WNOE. From New Orleans, Burbank went on to CKLW in Detroit/Windsor in the mid 70's, and then back to Louisville for a successful, lengthy afternoon gig on WHAS-AM. Burbank left Louisville again for a brief spell in Tampa, Florida at WDAE, but moved to the Ohio Valley in 1981 when he signed with WLW, originally doing morning drive time but later moving to afternoons. It is there that he has enjoyed his greatest success, developing his best- known characters: * Earl Pitts Uhmerikun, a full-blooded redneck who makes daily commentary on everything from politics to family to friends. * Gilbert Gnarley, a senior citizen who made crank calls to various businesses and people. * Howlin' Blind Muddy Slim, Your 60-Minute Jelly-Belly Toejam Man (a/k/a Blues Break 201), a Friday afternoon music show which featured blues artists as guest stars. * Eunice and Bernice, the \\"Siamese twins joined at the telephone\\" (\\"turr-a-bull, turr-a-bull, turr-a-bull\\") * The Right Rev. Deuteronomy Skaggs, radio preacher who encouraged listeners to \\"dig in them jeans and pull out them greens\\" (money). Skaggs and Eunice and Bernice carried over from Burbank's WHAS days. * Ranger Bob, children's show host. * Riley Gert, of the U.S. Senseless Survey, who prank calls people asking obscure and sometimes awkward questions for the Survey. Riley was not actually a characterization of Gary Burbank, but of his sidekick Doc Wolfe. * The Synonymous Bengal, a mole in the Cincinnati Bengals organization who calls in to provide anonymous rumors about the team using frequent malapropisms. * Lars Peavey, talk show host (tribute to the comedy team of Bob and Ray) * Dan Buckles, newscaster (takeoff on Dan Rather and David Brinkley); his on-air partners, Kevin \\"Doc\\" Wolfe and Leah Burns, portrayed vocal spoofs of Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer in the news segment. Buckles didn't hide the fact that he loved to dress in women's clothing and often made comments about his high heels or how tight his dress happened to be as he transitioned from one news item to the next. * Portia Lynn Commode, reporter * Ludlow Bromley, the \\"richest dude in the world\\" (named after Northern Kentucky cities) * Bass Ackwards, news commentator * Thelma Hooch, helpful hints * Maw Hirishi, advice columnist * Bruiser LaRue, football player * Big Fat, AKA, The Big Fat Balding Guy With a Stubby Cigar in His Mouth and His Pants Half-Zipped, pushy con man seller of a wide variety of worthless junk. Often joined by his mascot, Timmy the Termite who would endorse the product or pretend to be a famous celebrity endorsing the junk. Sign off line was always \\"And dis time I'm being honest wit' youse.\\" Burbank regularly satirized former Cincinnati mayor Jerry Springer, along with other local politicians, newscasters, and celebrities, such as former Cincinnati Reds owner \\"Saint CEO\\" Marge Schott. Satirical radio serials were also used to lampoon the (often struggling) Reds baseball team (\\"The Reds and the Restless\\", \\"The Hunt for Reds October\\") and the Cincinnati Bengals (\\"All My Bengals\\"). Burbank also hit the Top 100 in 1980 with the song \\"Who Shot J. R.?\\", a novelty record about the cliffhanger on that year's season finale of Dallas. Another feature of his show was the sports trivia quiz show Sports or Consequences which ran during the 4:00 hour during his afternoon show on 700 WLW. The show was unusual in that the callers asked the hosts (Burbank and his supporting cast, plus a number of other WLW on air personalities) sports trivia questions, instead of the hosts asking the callers questions. If questions were not asked in proper form, the caller could expect the call to end with a loud boom (and a sound clip: \\"sounded like a big supplosion\\"). Proper form included not asking if the panel would our could answer with the correct name or fact...\\"Can we? YES!\\" Upon expressing satisfaction that they had answered correctly, the panel broke out in chant; \\"Heyyy! We don't...we don't...we don't mess around...HEY!\\" Burbank often did his show from a home in north central Florida, while the rest of his show's cast and crew was in the WLW studios in Cincinnati. Burbank's show in the late 1990s was syndicated out of WLW to other regional stations (including WTVN in Columbus, WAKR in Akron and WERE in Cleveland). By 1999, the show would revert to being only on WLW, although a weekly \\"best-of\\" show dubbed the Weekly Rear- View - which featured mostly character bits and little-to-no Cincinnati- centric material - would run until his retirement. The network (and eventually, the program itself) was called \\"The BBC: The Broad-bank Burb- casting Corporation,\\" a send-up of Gary Owens' classic line. Today, Earl Pitts' daily \\"commentaries\\" are still syndicated throughout the country on about 200 stations. Burbank's show was also eventually heard, along with the rest of WLW's programming, on XM Satellite Radio Channel 173. Burbank has won several major awards, including back-to-back Marconi Awards as Large Market Personality of the Year in 1990 and 1991. In November 2012, Burbank was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame. ==Restaurant ownership== Burbank founded and co-owned Burbank's Real Bar-B-Q and Ribs restaurant in Sharonville, Ohio. In December 2009, the restaurant closed. The Sharonville restaurant was the first to open and last to close. There were others, including one at I-75 and US 42 in Florence, Kentucky, Louisville, KY and one on Colonel Glenn Highway in Fairborn, OH near Wright State University and WPAFB and for a brief period, one in Columbus, OH at the corner of Bethel and Sawmill Roads. There were also locations at 3300 Parkcrest Lane in Western Hills and another one in the Eastgate area of Cincinnati. ==Retirement== On March 7, 2007, Burbank announced that he would retire on December 31, at the expiration of his contract. The last show was broadcast on Friday, December 21, 2007. Despite Burbank's retirement, Earl Pitts' commentaries will continue to broadcast on its network of affiliates including WLW. On September 23, 2009, Burbank returned to the airwaves at his old time slot of 3p-6p with then hosts Eddie Fingers and Tracy Jones promoting his new book \\"Voices In My Head.\\" ==References== ==External links== * Gary's online stream * Gary Burbank's page at www.700wlw.com * Gary Burbank at WAKY retrospective site * Earl Pitts and Gary Burbank Show official site * Pirate BBC, all about The show * Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:Radio personalities from Cincinnati Category:Radio personalities from Louisville, Kentucky Category:Radio personalities from Memphis, Tennessee ","title":"Gary Burbank"},{"id":"9139755","text":"Eupraxia may refer to: * Eupraxia (mythology) * Eupraxia - the art of performing a function correctly as discussed in the Memorabilia (Xenophon) * Eupraxia or Euphrasia of Constantinople * Eupraxia of Kiev, Holy Roman Empress. ==See also== * Praxis (disambiguation) * Dyspraxia ","title":"Eupraxia"},{"id":"9139757","text":"Toll roads in Great Britain, used to raise fees for the management of roads in the United Kingdom, were common in the era of the turnpike trusts. Currently there is a single major road, the M6 Toll and a small number of bridges and tunnels where tolls are collected. In addition, there are also two UK road pricing schemes, the London congestion charge and the Durham congestion charge. ==History== Original board of Toll Road charges, from Hammerhead Toll, Fife, east of Auchtermuchty (1871) Fife Folk Museum ===Medieval period === In the 14th century, pavage grants, which had previously been made for paving the market place or streets of towns, began also to be used for maintaining some roads between towns. These grants were made by letters patent, almost invariably for a limited term, presumably the time likely to be required to pay for the required works. Responsibility for the upkeep of most roads seems to have rested with landowners, however. This was probably not easily enforced against them. The Parliament of England placed the upkeep of bridges to local settlements or the containing county under the Bridges Act 1530 and in 1555 the care of roads was similarly devolved to the parishes as statute labour under the Highways Act 1555. Every adult inhabitant of the parish was obliged to work four consecutive days a year on the roads, providing their own tools, carts and horses. The work was overseen by an unpaid local appointee, the Surveyor of Highways. It was not until 1654 that road rates were introduced. However, the improvements offered by paid labour were offset by the rise in the use of wheeled vehicles greatly increasing wear to the road surfaces. The government reaction to this was to use legislation to limit the use of wheeled vehicles and also to regulate their construction. A vain hope that wider rims would be less damaging briefly led to carts with sixteen inch wheels. They did not cause ruts but neither did they roll and flatten the road as was hoped. ===Turnpikes=== Toll Gate tickets, c.1830 The first turnpike road, whereby travellers paid tolls to be used for road upkeep, was authorised in 1663 for a section of the Great North Road in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Huntingdonshire.Statute, 15 Car. II, c.1 (private); 16 & 17 Car. II, c.6; E. Pawson, Transport and Economy: the turpike roaqds of 18th century England (Academic Press, London 1977), 77. The term turnpike refers the military practice of placing a pikestaff across a road to block and control passage. Upon payment of the toll, the pike would be \\"turned\\" to one side to allow travellers through. Most English gates were not built to this standard; of the first three gates, two were found to be easily avoided. The early turnpikes were administered directly by the justices of the peace in quarter sessions. The first trusts were established by Parliament through an Act of Parliament in 1706, placing a section of the London-Coventry-Chester road in the hands of a group of trustees. The trustees could erect gates as they saw fit, demand statute labour or a cash equivalent, and appoint surveyors and collectors, in return they repaired the road and put up mileposts. Initially trusts were established for limited periods ‚Äì often twenty one years. The expectation was that the trust would borrow the money to repair the road and repay that debt over time with the road then reverting to the parishes. In reality the initial debt was rarely paid off and the trusts were renewed as needed. Shortly after the creation of Great Britain in 1707, turnpike acts began to be passed by Parliament to encourage the construction of toll roads in Scotland in the same way they had been used successfully in England and Wales. The first turnpike act for a road scheme in Scotland was passed in 1713 for the construction of a road in Midlothian.Roads eastrenfrewshire.gov.uk, accessed 4 April 2010 Although in the south of England common carriers' carts became frequent, they were not seen for a long time north of York or west of Exeter. Long trains of packhorses still carried goods through Settle until the Keighley and Kendal Turnpike was started in 1753.Introduction To The Main Roads of Kendale British Historyac.uk. Accessed 30 Sept 2012 The decline of turnpikes The rise of railway transport largely halted the improving schemes of the turnpike trusts. The London-Birmingham railway almost instantly halved the tolls income of the Holyhead Road. The system was never properly reformed but from the 1870s Parliament stopped renewing the acts and roads began to revert to local authorities, the last trust vanishing in 1895. However, some bridges continue to be privately owned and subject to tolls. The Local Government Act 1888 created county councils and gave them responsibility for maintaining the major roads. The abiding relic of the English toll roads is the number of houses with names like \\"Turnpike Cottage\\", the inclusion of \\"Bar\\" in place names and occasional road name: Turnpike Lane in northern London has given its name to an Underground station. ===Since the 1960s=== Following the abolition of turnpikes a few private roads and toll bridges remained. Some bridges of the turnpike era were built by companies (rather than trusts) and have continued to charge tolls. Tolls on some bridges were abolished by county councils buying up the tolls and then declaring them county bridges. A recent example of this relates to the well-known Cob at Porthmadog, where tolls ceased in 2006, when it was nationalised by the Welsh Assembly. Tolls are similarly collected to finance the cost of building the Humber Bridge and Severn Bridge. In recent times, the concept of charging tolls to finance the building of roads has been revived, but so far the only new toll road is M6 Toll. Tolls for the Forth Road Bridge were removed in 2008 following a divisive three-year political debate during which it was proposed that variable congestion pricing tolls would be introduced. ==Current tollsRoads=== *M6 Toll *College Road, Dulwich http://www.dulwichestate.co.uk/tollgate/hours-of-operation-and- toll *Penmon, Anglesey *Sandwich Bay, Kent ===Bridges & Tunnels=== *Dartford Crossing (1963 and 1981) *Humber Bridge *Mersey Tunnels (1886 and 1971) *Tamar Bridge (1961) *Tyne Tunnel (1967) *Mersey Gateway (Cheshire) (2017) ===Congestion pricing zones=== *London congestion charge *Ultra Low Emission Zone *Durham congestion charge == See also == *Road pricing in the United Kingdom *Toll roads in Europe *Toll bridge *Drovers' road A route for droving livestock on foot from one place to another, such as to market or between summer and winter pasture *Causey Mounth An ancient drovers' road over the coastal fringe of the Grampian Mountains in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. ==References== ==External links== * Historical overview of old toll roads in Scotland * Planned toll road in South Wales United Kingdom Category:Roads in Scotland Category:Roads in England *Tool roads Category:Transport policy in the United Kingdom ","title":"Toll roads in Great Britain"},{"id":"9139763","text":"An Collins is an English poet, and the otherwise unknown author credited with the authorship of Divine Songs and Meditacions, a collection of poems and prose meditations published in 1653.

The difficulty in determining concrete details about Collins is made even more difficult due to the style of her writing, as any definite facts about her life are either not present, or brief and cryptic.Gottlieb 2004, Collins, An. Convention has led to referring to Collins as a woman, due to the ease of relating the name \\"An\\" to the more common, in the mid-17th century, \\"Anne\\". Additionally, though there is evidence within the verses that indicate that Collins is a female, there is, like much else of Collins, no firm evidence. In addition, some scholars have speculated that \\"An\\" could be a pseudonym, or the \\"An\\" could even refer to the indefinite article \\"an\\", indicating that the poet's first name was unknown to the publisher.Ostrovich and Sauer 2004, p. 387. One aspect that can be determined is that Collins suffered from at least some sort of physical infirmity. Numerous references within Divine Songs indicate either a physical deformity, childhood illness, or adult sickness that left Collins confined to an indoors life. This is suggested to be a heavily motivating factor in her writing of Divine Songs.Evans 2003, p. xiii ==Divine Songs and Meditacions== The volume, Divine Songs and Meditacions is, itself, divided into many semi- independent \\"songs\\" and \\"meditacions\\" that range in style and subject matter. Most deal directly with religious matters, but there are several portions, notably \\"A song composed in time of the Civill Warr, when the wicked did much insult over the godly,\\" that focus directly on the political environment of English circa the English Civil War. Scholars praise Collins' work for its diverse forms and striking language, however, Collins is predominantly studied for topical, thematic, or historical reasons, rather than her technical prowess as an artist.Evans 2003, p. xi, xii Collins' style is praised by some scholars. There has been some work done in analyzing the metric forms of Divine Songs, such as the usage of [Rime royal] in The Preface of Divine Songs.Greer et al 1988, p. 150 However, it is also true that Collins' work has an important historical significance. It is one of the first collected volumes of women's poetry from the seventeenth century, and provides a glimpse into the life of a woman writer, and especially the political, social, and religious background that one would have lived in.Evans 2003, p. xi ==Religious and political viewsReligious views=== There has been a substantial amount of writing done on the subject of An Collins' religious beliefs. As Ostovich and Sauer state it, \\"An Collins' religious beliefs have been variously defined as anti-Puritanical, Calvinist, Catholic, anti- Calvinist, and Quaker...\\" All of these can be seen as true at different points in Divine Songs. In The Discourse, Collins presents a very standard primer on Protestant teachings, and her exceptional focus on sin has led some to call her a Calvinist. However, the lack of focus on predestination makes this prospect seem unlikely. Some scholars have put forth the idea that Collins shows a tendency towards Catholicism. In particular, Collins' \\"meditacions\\" appear to follow the \\"Short Method for Meditation\\" put forth by the Catholic Bishop of Geneva, Francis de Sales. This is further evidenced by the growing popularity of de Sales' Introduction a la Vie Devote, which has three separate English editions published by 1613. Collins viewed herself as manifesting divine truth, and that her poetic skill was simply a means to communicate a divine message. Collins intends for her readers to explore \\"the scriptures touched in this book.\\"Graham, et al 1989, p. 55 ===Political views=== Similar to her religious views, there has been much study and speculation on Collins' political views. She has been described as \\"critical of sectaries and Independents, pro-Commonwealth, opposed to the radical wing of Parliament, anti-Commonwealth, and Royalist.\\" One thing is certain; Collins writes a great deal of responses to the conflicts between the Parliamentarians and Royalists of the English Civil War. Collins clearly opposes the Engagement Oath, which was similarly protested by many religious groups. While Collins clearly demonstrates a measure of dissent against the politics of her day, the language of her poems makes it difficult to pinpoint exactly what her views are on many serious issues of the day. ==Legacy and influence== Collins' relative obscurity have prevented a widespread influence, however, it has been argued that Collins provides a model for the later tradition of Puritan diary writing.Cunnar 1993, p. 49 The largest barrier to Collins' influence has been the limited availability of her works. Though the original publishing details are unknown, there is only one copy still surviving today, located at the Huntington Library. However, since the 1996 publishing of a revised edition of Divine Songs and Meditacions, edited by Sidney Gottlieb, a substantial amount of new literature has been published regarding Collins and her writing. ==Notes== ==References== *Cunnar, Eugene R. \\"An Collins\\" in Hester, M.

Set in 1980s Manhattan, the plot revolves around the intimate relationship developing between Tony, a teenage boy from Little Italy, and Tye, a teenage girl from Chinatown, while both of their older brothers become engrossed in a heated gang war against each other. It also bears some similarities to the 1957 musical West Side Story, which similarly is an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet set among rival ethnic gangs in Manhattan, and also features a male protagonist named Tony. ==Release== The film was released theatrically on September 25, 1987 in 193 theaters and grossed $531,362 its opening weekend. the film grossed a domestic total of $1,262,091 and its widest release was to 193 theaters.

Hall, headquartered in Lincoln, Massachusetts, is a nonprofit organization dedicated to \\"protecting the nature of Massachusetts\\". Mass Audubon is independent of the National Audubon Society (NAS), just as in the neighboring state of Connecticut, where Connecticut Audubon Society is independent of the NAS. Both Mass Audubon and Connecticut Audubon Society were founded earlier than the NAS. Mass Audubon protects 36,500 acres of land throughout Massachusetts, saving birds and other wildlife, and making nature accessible to all with its wildlife sanctuaries and 20 nature centers. ==History== The Massachusetts Audubon Society (or Mass Audubon) was born out of Harriet Hemenway's desire to stop the commercial slaughter of birds for women's ornamental hats. Hemenway and her cousin, Minna Hall, soon enlisted 900 women and formed a partnership with many from Boston's scientific community to form their organization. They named the organization the Massachusetts Audubon Society in honor of the bird painter John James Audubon. In 1905, a national committee of Audubon societies was developed. This committee was vital in passing the Migratory Bird Conservation Act in 1913 and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 with Great Britain. The passage of these measures effectively eliminated the commercial plume trade. Mass Audubon's first wildlife sanctuary, Moose Hill Wildlife Sanctuary in Sharon, Massachusetts, dates back to 1916 when the board accepts an offer of Sharon resident George Field to use his property as a bird sanctuary. Mass Audubon purchased the parcel in 1922. ==Wildlife sanctuaries== Gordon Hall in Lincoln, Massachusetts Mass Audubon's statewide network of wildlife sanctuaries welcomes visitors of all ages and is a home for more than 150 endangered and threatened native species. *Allens Pond Wildlife Sanctuary, Westport *Arcadia Wildlife Sanctuary, Easthampton *Blue Hills Trailside Museum, Milton *Boston Nature Center, Mattapan *Broad Meadow Brook Conservation Center and Wildlife Sanctuary, Worcester *Broadmoor Wildlife Sanctuary, Natick *Daniel Webster Wildlife Sanctuary, Marshfield *Drumlin Farm Wildlife Sanctuary, Lincoln *Felix Neck Wildlife Sanctuary, Edgartown *Habitat Education Center and Wildlife Sanctuary, Belmont *High Ledges Wildlife Sanctuary, Shelburne *Ipswich River Wildlife Sanctuary, Topsfield *Joppa Flats Education Center *Long Pasture Wildlife Sanctuary, Barnstable *Moose Hill Wildlife Sanctuary, Sharon *North River Wildlife Sanctuary, Marshfield *Oak Knoll Wildlife Sanctuary, Attleboro *Pleasant Valley Wildlife Sanctuary, Lenox *Richardson Brook Wildlife Sanctuary, Tolland *Stony Brook Wildlife Sanctuary, Norfolk *Tidmarsh Wildlife Sanctuary, Plymouth *Wachusett Meadow Wildlife Sanctuary, Princeton *Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary, South Wellfleet *Mass Audubon Museum of American Bird Art, Canton ==Camp Wildwood== Camp Wildwood, established in 1950, is the Society's only overnight summer camp, and it is accredited by the American Camp Association.

This is the camp's third location, which it moved to in 2003 after previously being a boy scout camp called Camp Quinapoxet. The property includes a central shower house, arts and crafts center, 135-seat dining hall, health center, office, camp store, seven cabin sites, an archery range, high and low ropes challenge course, playing field, and several trails and areas of forest and wetland for exploration. During the summers, Camp Wildwood hosts campers ranging from ages 7 to 17. The programs at the camp include a day camp, a three-day session for campers 7 to 8 years old, one- and two-week sessions for campers ages 9 to 16, one- and two-week off-site Treks for campers ages 14‚Äì17, and a several-week long Leadership program (called LIT/LIA, meaning Leaders in Training and Leaders in Action) for campers ages 16 and 17. The camp also hosts several three-day long \\"Family Camp\\" sessions throughout the summer for all ages.

He played college basketball for the North Carolina Tar Heels where he won the 2009 national championship his junior year. Lawson was selected with the 18th overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves and was immediately traded to the Denver Nuggets. He played six seasons for the Nuggets and later played for the Houston Rockets, Indiana Pacers, Sacramento Kings and the Washington Wizards. Lawson played three seasons in the CBA for the Shandong Golden Stars and Fujian Sturgeons until he received a lifetime ban from the league for posts on Instagram that were deemed unacceptable. ==Early life== Lawson attended sixth and seventh grade at Gwynn Park Middle School in Prince George's County, Maryland. In the eighth grade, he was recruited to the Newport School in Kensington, Maryland. Lawson attended Bishop McNamara High School in Forestville, Maryland from 2003 to 2004. He later transferred to and graduated from Oak Hill Academy in Virginia, where he was a first-team USA Today and Parade All-American. He participated in the McDonald's All-American Game, Jordan Classic and the Nike Hoop Summit. During Lawson's senior year at Oak Hill Academy, he averaged 23.8 points, 9.1 assists and five steals. His highest scoring game in high school was 55 points. ==College career== Lawson while at North Carolina. Lawson began playing for the University of North Carolina Tar Heels in the 2006‚Äì07 season. In 38 games, he led the Tar Heels with 5.6 assists per game and was fourth with 10.2 points per game, during which time he helped the Tar Heels win a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference regular season title, as well as the ACC Tournament. During his sophomore year, he averaged 12.7 points and 5.3 assists per game, although he saw much less playing time due to an ankle sprain that kept him out much of the season. In spite of this nagging injury, he eventually returned to help Carolina repeat as both ACC regular season and tournament champions and ultimately earn a berth to the Final Four. He was charged with driving after drinking on June 6, 2008 by a police officer who felt that Lawson's music was too loud. He was not charged with a DWI because he was below the legal limit of .08 BAC, but still received misdemeanors due to state law prohibiting anyone under the age of 21 from driving after drinking any amount of alcohol. He was also charged for driving with a suspended license. On the day of the deadline to withdraw from the June 16 2008 NBA draft, Lawson decided to return to North Carolina for his junior season, along with Wayne Ellington, Danny Green and All-American Tyler Hansbrough, who all spurned the NBA draft to return to UNC, leaving the starters for the 2007‚Äì08 season intact for the 2008‚Äì09 season. Lawson was voted to the All-ACC First Team his junior year and was named the ACC Player of the Year, the first time a point guard had won the ACC's highest honor since fellow Tar Heel Phil Ford won the award in 1978. Lawson was also a consensus second-team all-American as a junior, making him eligible to have his jersey honored in the rafters of the Smith Center at the conclusion of his college career. In 2009, Lawson also won the Bob Cousy Award that honors the best collegiate point guard. During the 2009 NCAA championship game, he also set a record with 8 steals against Michigan State, giving him the most steals of any player in an NCAA championship game and helping lead the Tar Heels to a national title. On April 23, 2009, Lawson announced his decision to forgo his senior season and enter the 2009 NBA draft. == Professional career  Denver Nuggets (2009‚Äì2015) === Lawson in a game for the Nuggets in 2011. Due to concerns of his height and his often-sprained ankle, Lawson slipped to 18th in the 2009 NBA draft, where he was drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves. However, they had already drafted two point guards, making Lawson expendable. This gave the Denver Nuggets an opportunity to get a quality player as they traded their future draft pick to Minnesota in exchange for Lawson. Lawson served as a backup to Chauncey Billups for one and a half seasons until Billups was traded to the New York Knicks on February 22, 2011 as part of a trade which also sent star forward Carmelo Anthony to New York. On April 9, 2011, Lawson became the first player in NBA history to make his first 10 three-point attempts to start a game. He went 10-of-11 from behind three-point range and finished the game with a career-high 37 points, 7 rebounds, and 6 assists. On August 15, 2011, Lawson signed a one-year contract with ≈Ωalgiris Kaunas. The deal included an out-clause that allowed him to return to the Denver Nuggets when the 2011 NBA lockout ended. Lawson played seven Euroleague games during his stint in Kaunas, averaging 7.4 points, 3.0 rebounds and 1.6 assists. In 2012‚Äì13, the Nuggets finished with a franchise- best record of 57-25 and earned the third seed in the Western Conference. However, they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Golden State Warriors. Lawson led Denver in both scoring and assists for the series with averages of 21.3 points and 8.0 assists. In 2013‚Äì14, with Danilo Gallinari out injured with a torn ACL, Lawson led the team in points, assists and steals. The Nuggets' 2014‚Äì15 season took a turn for the worse with their record dropping to a dismal 30-52, good for the ninth-worst win/loss record in Nuggets history, and had a coaching change mid-season with Brian Shaw being replaced by Melvin Hunt. Despite the turmoil, Lawson managed to have a solid season with 15.2 points and a career-high 9.6 assists per game. His 720 total assists broke the Nuggets' single-season assists record of 714 held by Nick Van Exel. === Houston Rockets (2015‚Äì2016) === On July 20, 2015, the Nuggets traded Lawson and a 2017 second round draft pick to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Joey Dorsey, Nick Johnson, Kostas Papanikolaou, Pablo Prigioni, a 2016 first round draft pick, and cash considerations. He made his debut for the Rockets in the team's season opener against his former team the Denver Nuggets on October 28, recording 12 points and 6 assists as a starter in a 105‚Äì85 loss. He started in the Rockets' first 11 games of the season under coach Kevin McHale. However, after McHale was fired and J. B. Bickerstaff was named interim, Bickerstaff moved Lawson to the bench for the team's November 18 game against the Portland Trail Blazers. On December 18, he was suspended for two games by the NBA based on his guilty plea in November for driving while impaired and a lane usage violation after leaving a party in Denver in January 2015. On January 7, 2016, he was suspended for a further three games by the NBA for driving under the influence of alcohol in July 2015. On March 1, he was waived by the Rockets in a buyout agreement. === Indiana Pacers (2016) === On March 7, 2016, Lawson signed with the Indiana Pacers. He made his debut for the Pacers later that night at home against the San Antonio Spurs, managing just five minutes of action before spraining his left ankle during the second quarter, which ruled him out for the rest of the game. He missed the following five games before returning to action on March 21 against the Philadelphia 76ers. === Sacramento Kings (2016‚Äì2017) === On August 31, 2016, Lawson signed with the Sacramento Kings. On April 11, 2017, in his 551st NBA game, Lawson recorded his first career triple-double with 22 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds in a 129‚Äì104 win over the Phoenix Suns. === Shandong Golden Stars (2017‚Äì2018) === On August 9, 2017, Lawson signed a one-year, $2.4 million contract with the Shandong Golden Stars of the Chinese Basketball Association. In 46 games for Shandong, he averaged 25.5 points, 4.6 rebounds, 6.5 assists and 2.2 steals per game. === Washington Wizards (2018) === On April 12, 2018, Lawson signed with the Washington Wizards for the 2018 NBA Playoffs. Lawson's Wizards debut came in game 2 of the first round series against the Toronto Raptors, where he had 14 points and 8 assists in a Wizards defeat. Washington would go on to lose in six games, with Lawson averaging 5.8 points and 3.0 assists in 19.2 minutes per game. === Return to Shandong Golden Stars (2018‚Äì2019) === On December 15, 2018, Lawson returned and signed with the Shandong Golden Stars. === Fujian Sturgeons (2019‚Äì2020) === Ty Lawson agreed to sign with the Fujian Sturgeons of the Chinese Basketball Association for the 2019-2020 basketball season. Lawson opened the season with a loss in a 22 point, 7 assist, 5 rebound effort.. On September 19, 2020, Lawson was dropped by the Fujian Sturgeons over \\"inappropriate\\" social media posts detrimental to the team and received a lifetime ban from the Chinese Basketball Association. ==Career statisticsNBA=== Regular season -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Denver  65  8  20.3  .515  .410  .757  1.9  3.1  .7  .0  8.3 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Denver  80  31  26.3  .503  .404  .764  2.6  4.7  1.0  .1  11.7 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Denver  61  61  34.8  .488  .365  .824  3.7  6.6  1.3  .1  16.4 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Denver  73  71  34.4  .461  .366  .756  2.7  6.9  1.5  .1  16.7 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Denver  62  61  35.9  .431  .356  .798  3.5  8.8  1.6  .2  17.6 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Denver  75  75  35.5  .436  .341  .730  3.1  9.6  1.2  .1  15.2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Houston  53  12  22.2  .387  .330  .700  1.7  3.4  .8  .1  5.8 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Indiana  13  1  18.1  .418  .357  .500  2.4  4.4  .8  .1  4.9 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Sacramento  69  24  25.1  .454  .288  .797  2.6  4.8  1.1  .1  9.9 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Career  551  344  29.2  .460  .359  .770  2.7  6.0  1.2  .1  12.7 Playoffs -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2010  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Denver  6  0  19.7  .429  .400  .684  1.3  2.7  1.0  .0  7.8 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2011  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Denver  5  5  33.4  .500  .455  .913  3.4  3.8  1.0  .2  15.6 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2012  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Denver  7  7  34.6  .514  .321  .632  2.6  6.0  1.0  .1  19.0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2013  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Denver  6  6  39.3  .440  .190  .848  3.3  8.0  1.7  .0  21.3 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2016  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Indiana  7  0  10.6  .333  .000  .667  1.0  1.4  .4  .0  2.3 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2018  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Washington  5  0  19.2  .346  .625  1.000  2.6  3.0  0.6  .0  5.8 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Career  36  18  25.9  .458  .333  .792  2.3  4.2  0.9  .1  12.0 ===Euroleague=== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2011‚Äì12  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" ≈Ωalgiris  19  14  19.3  .471  .333  .710  2.3  1.8  1.0  .0  8.2  7.9 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text- align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Career  19  14  19.3  .471  .333  .710  2.3  1.8  1.0  .0  8.2  7.9 ===Chinese Basketball Association (CBA)=== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2017‚Äì18  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Shandong  46  6  36.1  .548  .401  .835  4.6  6.5  2.2  .04  25.5 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2018-19  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Shandong  24  2  35.0  .511  .352  .841  3.9  8.7  1.8  .04  26.5 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"2019-20  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Fujian  33  21  35.0  .514  .428  .829  5.6  8.8  2.7  .09  27.3 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Career  103  29  36.0  .528  .397  .834  4.8  7.8  2.3  .06  26.3 ===College Basketball=== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2006-07  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" North Carolina  38  31  25.7  .500  .356  .688  2.9  5.6  1.5  .1  10.2 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" 2007-08  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" North Carolina  32  29  25.3  .515  .361  .835  2.7  5.2  1.6  .0  12.7 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2008-09  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" North Carolina  35  35  29.9  .532  .472  .798  3.0  6.6  2.1  .1  16.6 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\"  Career  105  95  27.0  .516  .402  .780  2.9  5.8  1.8  .1  13.1 ==Arrests== Lawson has been arrested multiple times for driving under the influence (DUI). In 2008, 20-year-old Lawson pleaded guilty to underage drinking and driving after registering a .03 blood-alcohol level during a traffic stop in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Additional charges of violating a noise ordinance and driving with a revoked or suspended license were dropped and Lawson was required only to complete 20 hours of community service. In April 2012 in Arapahoe County, Colorado, Lawson was cited for careless driving, driving with a restricted license and permitting an unauthorized person to drive his car. Lawson was arrested in Denver on January 29, 2013 for avoiding prosecution for these offenses. He later pleaded guilty to allowing an unauthorized person to drive and the other charges were dropped. On August 17, 2013, Lawson and his girlfriend, Ashley Pettiford, were arrested by police in Arapahoe County responding to a domestic violence call. Lawson was arrested on suspicion of committing two misdemeanors, domestic violence-related harassment and property damage. Both Lawson and Pettiford were released on $1,000 bond and charges were ultimately dropped. On January 23, 2015, Lawson was arrested in Denver after driving almost twice the speed limit while under the influence of alcohol. In that incident, he admitted to police that he had a prior arrest for DUI in Missouri. One of the conditions of his $1,500 bond was that he not drink alcohol. On July 14, 2015, Lawson was arrested in Los Angeles on suspicion of driving under the influence. On July 17, a Denver judge ruled that Lawson would be required to spend a month at a residential rehabilitation center before facing DUI charges in either Colorado or California. ==See also== * 2009 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans * 2006 high school boys basketball All-Americans ==References== ==External links== * EuroLeague profile * \\"The Potential of Lawson Exceeds the Risk\\" at nba.com Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:African-American basketball players Category:All-American college men's basketball players Category:American expatriate basketball people in China Category:American expatriate basketball people in Lithuania Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players at the 2008 NCAA Men's Division I Final Four Category:Basketball players at the 2009 NCAA Men's Division I Final Four Category:Basketball players from Maryland Category:BC ≈Ωalgiris players Category:Denver Nuggets players Category:Fujian Sturgeons players Category:Houston Rockets players Category:Indiana Pacers players Category:McDonald's High School All-Americans Category:Minnesota Timberwolves draft picks Category:North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball players Category:Parade High School All-Americans (boys' basketball) Category:People from Clinton, Maryland Category:People from Forestville, Maryland Category:Point guards Category:Sacramento Kings players Category:Shandong Heroes players Category:Washington Wizards players ","title":"Ty Lawson"},{"id":"9139883","text":"Kawake station is a railway station located in Nagahama, Shiga, on the Hokuriku Main Line of JR West in Japan. ==External links== * Kawake Station (JR West official page) Category:Railway stations in Shiga Prefecture Category:Railway stations in Japan opened in 1954 ","title":"Kawake Station"},{"id":"9139905","text":"Kenby≈çin-mae is a Hiroden station (tram stop) on Hiroden Ujina Line, located in Minami-ku, Hiroshima. ==Routes== From Kenby≈çin-mae Station, there are three of Hiroden Streetcar routes. *25px Hiroshima Station - Hiroshima Port Route *25px Hiroden-nishi-hiroshima - Hiroshima Port Route *25px Hiroshima Station - (via Hijiyama-shita) - Hiroshima Port Route ==Connections== ;‚ñà Ujina Line :25px 25px 25px ::Hirodaifuzokugakk≈ç-mae ‚Äî Kenby≈çin-mae ‚Äî Ujina 2-ch≈çme ==Around station== *Hiroshima Prefectural Hospital *Prefectural University of Hiroshima *Ujina Post Office *JUSCO Miyuki ==History== *Opened as \\"Koryo- chugaku-mae\\" on November 27, 1935. *Renamed to the present name \\"Kenbyoin-mae\\" in 1948. ==See also== *Hiroden Streetcar Lines and Routes *List of railway stations in Japan ==External links== Kenbyoin-mae Station Category:Railway stations in Japan opened in 1935 ","title":"Kenbyoin-mae Station"},{"id":"9139907","text":"The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) is the governing body for cricket in the Indian state of West Bengal.

They are featured in many highway systems; most are found in the Interstate Highway System, U.S. highway system, and several state highway systems. Each type of special route possesses generally defined characteristics and has a defined relationship with its parent route. Typically, special routes share a route number with a dominant route, often referred as the \\"parent\\" or \\"mainline\\", and are given either a descriptor which may be used either before or after the route name, such as Alternate or Business, or a letter suffix that is attached to the route number. For example, an alternate route of U.S. Route 1 may be called \\"Alternate U.S. Route 1\\", \\"U.S. Route 1 Alternate\\", or \\"U.S. Route 1A\\". Occasionally, a special route will have both a descriptor and a suffix, such as U.S. Route 1A Business. ==Nomenclature== Truck Business US 17 ends at its parent in Elizabeth City, North Carolina In the field, the special route is typically distinguished from the parent route with the use of auxiliary words or suffix letters placed on the route shield or on an adjacent sign, known as a \\"banner\\" or \\"plate\\" or according to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, a \\"route sign auxiliary sign\\". A common roadfan synonym for special route is \\"bannered highway\\" or \\"bannered route\\", terms coined from the presence of these companion signs. The term is not all-encompassing however, as not all special routes have these sign plates. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) sets the nationwide precedent for special routes, particularly for U.S. Numbered Highways. As of 2009, the standards organization only advocates four types of special routes: business, bypass, alternate, and temporary. AASHTO suggests that transportation authorities of the United States remove other types of special routes and/or replace such obsolete designations with another type of route. Some old alignments of routes may also be informally known as special routes (despite some that do not intersect the parent route). These older alignments may be given street names like \\"Old U.S. Highway 52\\", or in some rare cases, be signed with route shields attached to \\"Old\\" or \\"Historic\\" sign plates (such as decommissioned sections of former U.S. Route 66 that are still driveable). In the case of U.S. state route systems, special routes are generally restricted to primary state routes, not secondary state routes, though Missouri has three supplemental routes with short spur routes, and the 500-series county routes in New Jersey have alternate, bypass, spur, and truck routes. A few highways have two special route designations. Some of these doubly designated special routes are: * Alternate Business US 66 in Springfield, Missouri * Business US 1A in downtown Bangor, Maine * Truck Business US 17 in Elizabeth City, North Carolina * Business US 77 Alternate in Yoakum, Texas *U.S. Route 202 Alternate Truck in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania (Many Pennsylvania highways use this \\"Alternate Truck\\" pattern) * Business Alternate US 58 in Norton, Virginia and Big Stone Gap, Virginia. There is also an example of a route with three special route designations. U.S. Route 30 Business Alternate Truck provides an alternate truck bypass of U.S. Route 30 Business in Downingtown, Pennsylvania. ==Special route types and respective behavior== SH-9 in Hobart, Oklahoma ends at its parent route. The center SH-9 shield is topped with a typical \\"BUSINESS\\" plate. Routes with special designations in the U.S. have typical behavior that distinguishes them from other routes. There are, however, many exceptions to the common behavior, depending on the situation. ===Business, City, and Bypass routes=== Business routes (also known as city routes) can be loops or spurs and generally traverse through or near population centers (usually towns and small cities). They are usually signed with \\"\\" or \\"\\" auxiliaries or a \\"B\\" suffix. Most business routes are the former alignments of their parent. Bypass routes (rarely known as \\"Relief routes\\") typically go around population centers and are newer and faster than their mainline and/or business route counterparts. In some cases, due to urban sprawl over time, land around bypasses can become developed, expanding the population center outward and creating a misnomer with the term \\"bypass\\" (e.g. U.S. Highway 17 Bypass in Myrtle Beach). Approaching a population center, it is common for the parent route to split between a business route and a bypass route and rejoin to form the parent on the other side. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) defines a business route for U.S. highways as > ...a route principally within the corporate limits of a city which provides > the traveling public an opportunity to travel through that city, passing > through the business part of the city; while the regular number is used to > obviate passing through the congested part of the city. This \\"Business > Route\\" connects with the regular numbered route at the opposite side of the > city limits. AASHTO defines bypass or relief routes for U.S. highways as: > ...a route which is established for the purpose of designating a route which > entirely by-passes a city or congested area and joins in with the regular > numbered route beyond the city or congested area. Business Interstates Business Loop Interstate 85 AASHTO defines a category of special routes separate from primary and auxiliary Interstate designations known as Interstate Business routes. These routes do not have to comply to Interstate construction standards, but are routes that may be identified and approved by the association. The same route marking policy applies to both U.S. Numbered Highways and Interstate highways; however, business route designations are sometimes used for Interstate highways. Known as Business Loops and Business Spurs, these routes that principally travel through the corporate limits of a city, passing through the central business district of the city. Business routes are used when the regular route is directed around the city. They sport green Interstate shields, as opposed to the normal red and blue, with the word \\"Business\\" replacing the normal \\"Interstate\\" word on the upper portion of the shield. Truck routes U.S. Route 1/9 Truck in New Jersey Truck routes were initially known as Bypass routes, and were loops created as a means to divert through truck traffic away from population centers, but the designation was changed to \\"bypass\\" in 1959-1960 by AASHTO. Today, Truck routes exist as alternatives for the mainline routes that are ill-suited for large truck travel with obstacles (such as low clearance bridges, sharp turns, or steep grades) or with conditions that could create dangerous situations to smaller vehicles. An example of such a route is U.S. Route 1/9 Truck in New Jersey, which bypasses the segment of U.S. Route 1/9 that uses the Pulaski Skyway, a skyway on which trucks are banned. ===Alternate Truck Routes=== There are alternate truck routes in several counties in Pennsylvania. They bypass weight-restricted bridges over creeks and rivers. They are mainly routed on major highways and freeways and other roads they intersect to bypass that specific bridge. An example of an alternate truck route is Pennsylvania Route 82 Alternate Truck which bypasses a weight-restricted bridge over East Branch of Red Clay Creek. All of the alternate truck routes were signed in 2013. ===Alternate and Optional routes=== Alternate routes are loops that provide alternative alignment for a parent route. They are usually signed with an \\"\\" or \\"\\" auxiliary or an \\"A\\" suffix. They generally traverse through a different settlements or different city neighborhoods than the parent route, but roughly remain parallel to the parent. Unlike business routes and bypasses, their relationship to population centers varies from case to case. Alternates also can be quite longer than most other special routes with some spanning over 50 miles (e.g. US 1A in Maine and US 74A in North Carolina). Prior to 1960 there were \\"optional\\" routes in the United States that were synonymous with alternate routes. As a means of providing uniformity, the \\"Optional\\" term was phased out in the 1960s. AASHTO defines and specifies that alternate routes should have the following behavior: > An \\"Alternate Route\\" shall be considered a route which starts at a point > where it branches off from the main numbered route, may pass through certain > cities and towns, and then connect back with the regular route some miles > distant. Since it is the purpose of the U.S. numbered system to mark the > best and shortest route available, an alternate route should be designated > only where both routes are needed to accommodate the traffic demand, and > when the alternate route has substantially the same geometric and structural > design standards of the main marked routing. It is recommended that in case > an alternate route is marked, that the shorter and better constructed route > be given the regular number and the other section designated as the > \\"Alternate Route\\". It is further recommended that the Highway Department > erect signs at the junction points of the regular and alternate routes > giving the distance between the cities or points concerned... In no instance > should an alternate routing be used for the purpose of keeping an obsolete > section on the U.S. numbered system after a new routing has been constructed > and available to traffic. ===Spur and Connector routes=== Conn. M-44 is a Connector route. Spur routes split away from the parent route without returning. They usually end in a settlement or area not served by the parent. Connector routes are spurs that connect the parent route with a nearby prominent route, usually an Interstate highway (e.g. Connector M-44 [Conn. M-44] connects M-44 to I-96). Both Spurs and Connectors are generally very short in length, not spanning more than ten miles (16 km). ===Scenic routes=== Scenic US 412 in Kansas, OK, concurrent with US 59 Scenic routes, in terms of special routes, are loops of a parent route that traverse through an area of natural or historical significance. Only one route in the country remains with the official Scenic designation: US 40 Scenic. ===Toll routes=== Toll I-376 in Pennsylvania Toll routes, in terms of special routes, are loops that are faster than the parent route, but are tolled. The other usage with the promulgation of the 2009 MUTCD is to use a new yellow toll plate above the marker along tolled segments of highways. ===Loop routes=== Georgia Loop 10 is a loop route. Loop routes, in terms of special routes, are loops that form a complete radial around an area, having at least one intersection with the parent route. Because of their circumferential nature, inner/outer directions have been used to sign such routes, as opposed to cardinal directions, though this convention is not universally followed (Arizona Loops 101, 202, and 303 in the Phoenix metropolitan area do not follow such convention, and are signed with cardinal directions based on their local orientation). Georgia State Route 10 Loop, which is the perimeter highway around Athens, Georgia, and the former Georgia State Route 120 Loop, which encircled a section of Marietta, Georgia, are two examples. Loop routes are common throughout Texas; see List of state highway loops in Texas. ===Temporary routes=== Route 41 Temporary signage in Haddonfield, New Jersey Temporary routes complete a gap between two segments of a parent route that exists because the parent route through the area has not been fully constructed. They serve as a long-term detour until the parent route's planned path is completed, at which point the Temporary designation is either removed or replaced by another designation such as Alternate or Business. Temporary routes generally traverse along roads of a lower standard than the planned mainline. An example is US 191 through a copper mine north of Clifton, Arizona. AASHTO defines and specifies that temporary routes should have the following behavior: > In the erection of signs for numbering routes, it is necessary in some cases > to carry a number temporarily over a road that ultimately will not be the > permanent location of that number. Great care should be taken by the State > Highway Departments in seeing that when numbers of this character are > permitted, that a standard strip carrying the words \\"Temporary\\" shall be > placed on the staff above the number. This will obviate much hard feeling > when it is necessary to change a number to the permanently established > route. ===Emergency detour routes=== Emergency plate Emergency I-94 shields in Coloma, Michigan A rare type of special route, known as the Emergency Detour route, is signed with an auxiliary \\"Emergency\\" banner that is colored orange, indicating a temporary traffic control sign. The purpose of these routes is to offer an alternative in the event that the parent route is impassable, due to either a traffic jams, traffic collision, or road closure (for a variety of reasons). Emergency U.S. Route 31, which offers an alternative crossing of the Grand River in the event that the bascule bridge in Grand Haven, Michigan is unavailable for motorists, is one such route. According to the Michigan Department of Transportation, \\"This route would only be used in emergency situations and worst-case scenarios impacting the entire bridge structure.\\" Emergency Interstate 94 follows Interstate 94 throughout much of southern Michigan. Ontario, Canada is one jurisdiction outside the United States with a very prevalent system of these roads. Other governments have a variation on this concept, though not always a \\"special route\\": ===Divided routes=== US 25 splits in Tennessee into US 25E and US 25W Some U.S. Routes are given directional suffixes to indicate a split of the main route ‚Äî for instance, U.S. Route 25 splits into U.S. Route 25E (east) and U.S. Route 25W (west) between Newport, Tennessee and North Corbin, Kentucky, and U.S. Route 9W is an alternate of U.S. Route 9 between Fort Lee, New Jersey and Albany, New York. These splits were in the system of United States Numbered Highways from the beginning, and were used when two roughly equivalent routes existed. They are usually loops, but some have been spurs, though since they use directional letter suffixes, they are not generally considered \\"bannered routes\\". The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials no longer assigns these numbers, and in theory current ones are to be eliminated \\"as rapidly as the State Highway Department and the Standing Committee on Highways can reach agreement\\". This policy was adopted by 1996; however, many of these routes still exist, mostly in Tennessee. ==History== Originally in the United States, the terms used for special routes were \\"City\\", \\"Truck\\", and \\"Optional\\". In 1959-1960, the terms were changed to \\"Business\\", \\"Bypass\\", and \\"Alternate\\", respectively; however, the \\"Truck\\" banner is still used today on many routes, especially those where trucks are prohibited on the mainline (for example, U.S. Route 1/9 Truck in Jersey City, New Jersey, which routes trucks around the Pulaski Skyway, which bans them). The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) has called for the removal of \\"alternate\\" routes, though many still exist. ==See also== * List of auxiliary Interstate Highways * List of special routes of the United States Numbered Highway System * List of business routes of the Interstate Highway System ==References== Category:Roads in the United States Category:Types of roads ","title":"Special route"},{"id":"9139924","text":"is a railway station located in Nagahama, Shiga, Japan. ==Adjacent stations== ==External links== * Kinomoto Station (JR West official page) Category:Railway stations in Shiga Prefecture Category:Railway stations in Japan opened in 1882 ","title":"Kinomoto Station"},{"id":"9139944","text":"is a railway station located in Nagahama, Shiga, Japan. ==External links== * Yogo Station (JR West official page) ==Adjacent stations== Category:Railway stations in Shiga Prefecture Category:Railway stations in Japan opened in 1957 ","title":"Yogo Station"},{"id":"9139957","text":"The National Guard of Georgia (NG, , sak'art'velos erovnuli gvardia) is a branch of the Defense Forces of Georgia.

Thus, it became the first national military formation in then-Soviet Georgia which would later provide the basis for the regular armed forces.http://www.tavisupleba.org/content/article/1550279.html Almost from its birth, the National Guard became directly involved in Georgian politics. In August 1991, soon after its foundation, the GNG was split between supporters of Gamsakhurdia and Kitovani. The split happened after Kitovani announced that the president was about to dissolve the National Guard. Kitovani and his supporters left the barracks and took up positions near Tbilisi. They joined Prime Minister Tengiz Sigua and the paramilitary leader Jaba Ioseliani during the Georgian Civil War which began in December 1991. The remaining parts of the GNG retained their loyalty towards Gamsakhurdia. Units of the National Guard were a major paramilitary force to have fought in the Georgian Civil War, South Ossetian and Abkhazian conflicts in the early 1990s.Georgian National Guard, The Global Security website.

Because of this depth, engineers chose Charco Azul as the site of a port for use by supertankers. As the dock is only 300 feet long, many captains of these supertankers worried that they would run aground, but the water is deep enough to support the largest ones. In fact, one can see deepwater fish swimming just underneath the dock. Since the late 1970s, Charco Azul has unloaded oil from Alaska to be shipped to the refineries of Houston and the Gulf coast of the United States. Originally it was a stopping spot for supertankers to unload and Panamax tankers to load to carry the oil across the Panama Canal. In 1982, the Trans-Panama pipeline was commissioned to transport the oil across to isthmus, with Charco Azul at the southern end. The pipeline was closed in 1996 as Alaskan oil shipments declined, but it began being used in the reverse direction in 2009 to ship crude oil to Pacific Rim refineries. ==References== Category:Bays of Panama Category:Bays of the Pacific Ocean Category:Panamanian coasts of the Pacific Ocean Category:Chiriqu√≠ Province ","title":"Charco Azul"},{"id":"9139974","text":"Samuel Jones (born June 2, 1935, Inverness, Mississippi) is an American composer and conductor. ==Biography== Samuel Jones, a native of Mississippi (b. 1935), graduated from the Central High School in Jackson and received his undergraduate degree with highest honors at Millsaps College. He acquired his professional training at the Eastman School of Music, where he earned his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in composition under Howard Hanson, Bernard Rogers, and Wayne Barlow. His mentors in conducting include Richard Lert and William Steinberg. Jones enjoyed his earliest success as a conductor, advancing through the ranks of smaller American orchestras to become music director of the Rochester Philharmonic. He was then asked to help found a significant new music school in Houston, Texas. He served as the first dean of the Shepherd School of Music at Rice University, building its faculty and facilities over six years as dean. Jones continued to serve as professor of composition and conducting after stepping down as dean, while serving as director of graduate studies. Jones influenced a number of conductors and composers through his work as a teacher at Rice and in workshops of the Conductors Guild and League of American Orchestras. His students include a number of accomplished composers and conductors, including Gabriela Lena Frank, Larry Rachleff and Andrew Levin. In 1997 Jones was appointed Composer in Residence at the Seattle Symphony. He retired from full-time academic life after 24 years at Rice to relocate to the Pacific Northwest and dedicate more of his attention to composition. Samuel Jones's compositions include an oratorio and three symphonies as well as shorter orchestral works, works for chorus and orchestra, opera, chamber music and works for children. One of his proudest achievements, which he mentioned to a Huffington Post reporter in 2015, was the unlikely feat of persuading author Truman Capote to allow him to set Capote's iconic story, A Christmas Memory, as an opera, which debuted in Dallas in 1992 and for which he wrote the libretto. His music has been performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Seattle Symphony, the Detroit Symphony, the Utah Symphony, the Houston Symphony, the Cincinnati Symphony, the Rochester Philharmonic, the Louisville Orchestra, the New Orleans Philharmonic, the Beaverton Symphony Orchestra and many others. His violin concerto was premiered in 2015 by Anne Akiko Meyers with the All-Star Orchestra conducted by Gerard Shwarz (online). His music is published by Carl Fischer and Campanile Music Press and is recorded by Naxos, CRI, Gasparo, ACA, and Centennial Records. Jones‚Äôs work as a conductor includes serving as conductor of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra and Saginaw Symphony Orchestra. He has been engaged as a guest conductor by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Buffalo Philharmonic, the Prague Symphony Orchestra, and the Iceland Symphony Orchestra. Early in his career he founded the Alma Symphony and the Delta College Summer Festival of Music in Michigan. He serves as music advisor to the Flint Symphony Orchestra in Michigan. Samuel Jones has served as president of the Conductors Guild and received numerous awards and prizes. These include a Ford Foundation Recording/Publication Award, grants from Martha Baird Rockefeller Foundation and National Endowment for the Arts grants, ASCAP awards, an International Angel Award, three Music Awards from the Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters, and the Seattle Symphony's 2002 Artistic Recognition Award for outstanding service to the orchestra. Millsaps College awarded him an honorary doctorate in May 2000. The same year he was inducted into the inaugural class of the Mississippi Musicians Hall of Fame. He was recently named the Music Alive Composer in Residence for the Meridian Symphony Orchestra by Meet The Composer and the League of American Orchestras. ==WorksTheater=== *A Christmas Memory *The Temptation of Jesus ===Orchestral=== *Aurum Aurorae *Chaconne and Burlesque *Chorale-Overture for Organ and Orchestra *Elegy *Fanfare and Celebration *Festival Fanfare *In Retrospect *Janus *Let Us Now Praise Famous Men *Listen Now, My Children *Overture for a City *Roundings: Musings and Meditations on Texas New Deal Murals *Three Suites From Roundings **I: Hymn To The Earth **II: Machines **III: The Open Range *Symphony No. 1 *Symphony No. 3 (Palo Duro Canyon) *A Symphonic Requiem (Variations on a Theme of Howard Hanson) ===Chorus and Orchestra=== *Canticles of Time (Symphony No. 2) *Eudora‚Äôs Fable: The Shoe Bird *Gaudeo *Reunion Benediction *The Seas of God (Fanfare-Overture) *The Trumpet of the Swan ===Concerti=== *Tuba Concerto *Horn Concerto *Concerto for Trombone and Orchestra *Concerto for Violoncello and Orchestra *Concerto for Violin and Orchestra ===Solo and Chamber=== *Four Haiku *How Do I Love Thee? *Piano Sonata *Sonata for Cello and Piano *Sonata for Unaccompanied Viola (In the Style of J.S.

He received the Order of the Legion of Honour of France. ==Biography== He studied medicine in Havana and Barcelona, earning his medical licence in 1877. Afterwards, he relocated to Paris, where he studied histology with Louis-Antoine Ranvier (1835‚Äì1922). In Paris, he interned under several renowned physicians, including urologist Jean Casimir F√©lix Guyon (1831‚Äì1920), who served as an important influence to Albarr√°n's career.

Albarr√°n's early career was largely spent in the fields of microbiology and histopathology, later switching to urology, a discipline in which he made several important contributions. He performed the first perineal prostatectomy in France, and is credited with introducing the so-called \\"Albarr√°n lever\\", a device used for adjusting the movements of a cystoscope during the catheterization of the ureter.

It nests in small shallow scrapes in the ground and lays clutches of 1-3 eggs. The species is monogamous and long-lived, with a life expectancy of approximately 11 years. The vast majority of pairs that mate together stay together during the following years of breeding and retain the same territory. The white-fronted plover has a similar appearance to the Kentish plover, with a white fore crown and dark bands connecting the eyes to the bill. ==Subspecies== Four or five subspecies are recognized, which vary in the colour shade of the neck collar and breast: * C. m. arenaceus (Clancey, 1971) occurs from southern Mozambique to the south-western Cape Province in South Africa. * C. m. marginatus (Vieillot, 1818), the nominate subspecies, occurs from southern Angola to the south-western Cape Province. * C. m. mechowi (Cabanis, 1884) occurs locally in Africa south of the Sahara to northern Angola, Botswana, Zimbabwe and northern Mozambique. * C. m. tenellus (Hartlaub, 1861) is endemic to Madagascar. * C. m. pons is a subspecies that is not currently accepted by all authorities. ==Description== juvenile, Chobe National Park, Namibia The average white-fronted plover weighs approximately 45-50 g, and the two sexes differ slightly in plumage coloration. Adult male plovers show a white forecrown and supercilium, with a dark band crossing the mid crown, with the rest of the crown a sandy grey colour. The face is mainly white, with a blackish brown stripe running from behind the eye to the ear coverts. The mantle, back, and rump is light greyish brown, with pale brown to grey fringing feathers. The upper covert and central feathers of the tail are black, and the lateral feathers are white. Primaries and secondaries are dark brown with white shafts, bases, and inner webs. White-fronted plovers also have a pale dusky-brown lateral patch on the upper breast, and white underparts, occasionally with a washed chestnut lower breast and upper belly. The eyes are brown, the bill is black, and the legs are pale grey, green-grey, or pale green/olive. Adult females have a similar appearance to adult males, however the black crown band is less defined and not as thick, and may even be absent in some cases. Juveniles have similar markings to adult females, but always lack the crown band altogether, and there is no black colouration on the head- lores are brown. The lateral breast patch is very variable between individuals of this species.Urban, E.K., C.H. Fry & S. Keith 1986: The birds of Africa, Vol. II. - Academic Press, London ==Calls== The voice of a white- fronted plover is often a gentle piping ‚Äòwit‚Äô, ‚Äòwoo-et‚Äô, ‚Äòtwirit‚Äô, and ‚Äòtirit- tirit‚Äô, as well as ‚Äòpi-peep‚Äô. When a plover is defending a territory, a harsh ‚Äòchiza-chiza‚Äô can be heard, followed by a ‚Äòpurrr‚Äô or ‚Äòsqueak‚Äô. When the incomplete egg set is visited, a ‚Äòcroo‚Äô sound is called, and during incubation a short ‚Äòclirrup‚Äô sound or ‚Äòclup‚Äô is made when alarmed. Other alarm calls consist of ‚Äòkittup‚Äô and ‚Äòchirrrt‚Äô. Adult courtship is a sharp ‚Äòkrewwwwww‚Äô, and freshly hatched chicks often call a ‚Äòtsick‚Äô, to get the attention of their parent. ==Distribution, movement and habitat== White-fronted plover on the hot sands of Nosy Be, south-western Madagascar ===Distribution=== The white- fronted plover is endemic to sub-saharan Africa, and occurs at varying densities from Senegambia and Somalia to South Africa. The species is present along the entire South African coast and is also found inland, near large lakes and rivers. It also inhabits Madagascar. In Madagascar, breeding populations are resident on all coasts, and also inland.Zefania, S. and Szekely, T. (2013) ‚ÄòWhite-Fronted Plover Charadrius marginatus‚Äô, in Safford, R. and Hawkins, F. (eds.) Birds of Madagascar. Helm field guides: Christopher Helm, pp. 317‚Äì319 A genetic study reported genetic differentiation between Madagascar and the mainland population. ===Movement=== The white-fronted plover has both resident and partially migratory populations, with some birds undertaking local seasonal movements.del Hoyo, J., Elliott, A., and Sargatal, J. 1996. Handbook of the Birds of the World, vol. 3: Hoatzin to Auks. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona, Spain. The coastal populations are largely sedentary, but occasionally move to more sheltered shores from exposed areas during harsh winters. Flooding of the lakes or the shores that they inhabit might urge inland populations to migrate. Birds mostly leave from December to May, moving from their inland habitats to the East coast of South Africa. ===Habitat=== The species predominantly inhabits sandy shores, coastal dunes, estuaries, river and lake shores, intertidal mudflats or rocky coasts. It prefers to nests away from the water on open shorelines or on exposed sand among dry kelp wrack.LLOYD, P. (2007) ‚ÄòAdult survival, dispersal and mate fidelity in the white-fronted Plover Charadrius marginatus‚Äô, Ibis, 150(1), pp. 182‚Äì187 It also nests on sandy shores, near both alkaline and fresh water inland rivers and lakes.Hayman, P.; Marchant, J.; Prater, A. J. 1986. Shorebirds. Croom Helm, London. ==Feeding== The white-fronted plover forages during both day and night, using the typical plover run-stop-search technique. This consists of running around, stopping suddenly to peck at an item and then running again. Prey can be pecked from the surface of water, or caught with shallow jabs, inserting less than half of the bill into the substratum. Another method used to forage is foot-trembling, which involves vibrating the toes on substratum to disturb small insects or force invertebrates to the surface. This has not been reported in the Madagascan populations. Other feeding techniques include flying up to catch insects, and feeding on insects that wash up on shore after getting caught in water. The main prey of the white-fronted plover are sand flies, grasshoppers, termites, mosquito pupae, fairy shrimp, gastropods, bivalves, isopods, crabs, and other small crustaceans and worms. Plovers mainly forage in the upper half of the intertidal zone on sandy beaches, along high water lines and flooded depressions of dunes in summer. In winter, they forage lower on the shore. They often follow the waves in and out, foraging on the freshly wetted ground. They prefer foraging during low tide, but also in kelp wrack at high tide. In the middle of the day, they often stop foraging to preen. Some individuals defend their feeding territories year round, while others forage in non-territorial flocks, sometimes in mixed-species flocks with sanderlings (Calidris alba) and curlew sandpipers (Calidris ferruginea). ==BehaviourBreeding=== The white-fronted plover is a monogamous solitary breeder with a life expectancy of approximately 11 years. It is usually found in pairs or in small flocks, but can also appear in larger flocks during the breeding season. For example, a flock of 375 individuals was observed in Namibia. Mates generally stay faithful to each other for a long period of time, however 'divorce' has been recorded in some cases. Plovers that have lost mates have been observed to acquire new mates, without losing their territory. This monogamy may be due to a reduced availability of alternative breeding options or possibly high costs of divorce.Summers, R.W. and Hockey, P.A.R. (1980) ‚ÄòBreeding biology of the white-fronted Plover (Charadrius marginatus) in the south-western cape, South Africa‚Äô, Journal of Natural History, 14(3), pp. 433‚Äì445 Courtship displays include male plovers performing an upright posture accompanied by high stepping movements, while females lower their head. A few shallow nest scapes may be created in the breeding territory before choosing the final nest site. The white-fronted plover is very defensive of its territory. If an intruder invades the territory, the bird puffs out its plumage and chases away the intruder while uttering buzzing calls.Parra, J.E., Beltr√°n, M., Zefania, S., Dos Remedios, N. and Sz√©kely, T. (2014) ‚ÄòExperimental assessment of mating opportunities in three shorebird species‚Äô, Animal Behaviour, 90, pp. 83‚Äì90 ===Territories=== Breeding pairs may have one breeding territory close to the high water mark that they are able to feed in, or have two territories that are defended, one for feeding and one for nesting. Nesting territories have an average size of 1.6 ha, and nests can be as close as 16.2 m to each other. The size and boundaries of these territories do not appear to differ much between years of breeding, and site fidelity was recorded as 97.3% for pairs that stayed together between years. Territories are defended against neighbouring birds of the same species, and can also be defended against other species that are in the vicinity, such as sanderlings and Kittlitz's plover (Charadrius pecuarius). Defensive behaviour often consists of low-level aerial attack, running at the intruder with lowered head, or aggressive forward-hunched postures. Non-territorial birds also exist, and as long as they keep to 'ordinary' behaviour pattens (feeding at a specific point and then flying away to a roosting site), the territorial birds appear to tolerate them. ===Nesting=== The typical white-fronted plover nest consists of a small shallow scrape in sand, gravel, or shingle, depending on the environment, and is sometimes lined with shell fragments, pebbles, seaweed or twigs. However scrapes are most commonly unlined. Nests are generally more than 70 m above the high water mark.Watson, J. J.; Kerley, G. I. H. 1995. A survey of the dune-breeding birds in the eastern Cape, South Africa. Ostrich 66(1): 15-20. They are often built among beach debris or near dune vegetation. Scrapes are created by the bird pushing its breast into the ground, slowly rotating whilst kicking backwards. Pairs may create more than one crape before choosing one to nest in, as scrape building often overlaps with courtship. 1-3 eggs are laid, with mean clutch size varying for different populations. In South Africa, mean clutch size is 2.05; in Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Malawi, it is 2.53 eggs. Egg laying dates vary between populations, which nest all year round on the coast but only from December to January in inland Namibia. Eggs are laid at 2-7 day intervals and are pale cream coloured, pointed ovals marked with fine blackish brown points and lines. The average dimensions of a white-fronted plover egg are 32.1 x 22.8 mm. Before the clutch is complete, the pair often visit the nest together, and occasionally straddle the egg, however no incubation is undertaken before the final egg is laid. During this joint behaviour, ‚Äòcroo‚Äô calls are made. ===Incubation=== Incubation is assumed to start at clutch completion (however this is not confirmed). The incubation period lasts for approximately 27‚Äì29 days, but can last up to 33 days. Both sexes incubate the nest during the day, and partly or fully cover the eggs with sand during the day in response to an approaching threat. Egg covering was not found to occur during normal breaks in incubation of the nest but only in response to a threat, and rarely at night. It is therefore hypothesised that egg covering is not related to temperature and insulation of eggs, but rather to predation avoidance.Summers, R.W. and Hockey, P.A.R. (1981) ‚ÄòEgg-covering behaviour of the white-fronted Plover Charadrius marginatus‚Äô, Ornis Scandinavica, 12(3), p. 240 It is thought that the male undertakes the majority of incubation during the night. If a clutch is lost, it is highly likely that a pair will re-lay eggs. ==Parental Care== The fledging period of chicks is approximately 35‚Äì38 days, and the proportion of hatched chicks that actually fledge is estimated to be 28%. If a predator or threat is near, adults with chicks or eggs near hatching date will perform distraction displays such as ‚Äòrodent running‚Äô and ‚Äòinjury feigning‚Äô. ‚ÄòRodent running‚Äô consists of the adult running fast, with a low head and a low spread tail, similar to a fleeing rodent. Injury feigning consists of the individual running or cowering on the ground whilst flapping one or both wings, with a partly spread tail. Chicks feed for themselves immediately after hatching, however parents can lead chicks to foraging areas up to 2.2 km from the nest. The annual adult survival rate for white-fronted plovers is 89-92%. This species is considerably longer lived than their northern relatives. ==Conservation== The white-fronted plover is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN due to its extremely large range, large population size, and while total population is decreasing, it appears not to do so at a threatening rate. The Madagascar population is estimated at 5,000‚Äì15,000 individuals (coastal surveys from Analalava to Tolagnaro yielded a total count of 1,457 individuals at 119 different locations), the global population at 73,500‚Äì103,500. Low nesting success may be partially compensated by multiple clutching and repeat nesting after egg loss, but overall there are too few data to reliably estimates population trends. ===Threats=== The main threat to the white- fronted plover is habitat loss due to wetland degradation or destruction.Hockey, P.A.R., Dean, W.R.J. and Ryan, P.G. 2005. Roberts birds of southern Africa. Trustees of the John Voelcker Bird Book Fund, Cape Town, South Africa.Wearne, K.; Underhill, L. G. 2005. Walvis Bay, Namibia: a key wetland for waders and other coastal birds in southern Africa. Wader Study Group Bulletin 107: 24-30. In Zimbabwe and southern Mozambique, an extensive recession of the species‚Äô inland range has taken place due to changes to river morphologies resulting from dam constructions. Key wetland sites in southern Africa, such as Walvis Bay in Namibia, have been subject to degradation because of the reclamation of wetlands for the development of suburbs, ports and roads. In Ghana, coastal erosion as well as proposed development involving drainage and land reclamation constitute a big threat for wetlands used as breeding habitat.Johnsgard, P. A. 1981.

It provides the most comprehensive account of the Goa Inquisition held by Portuguese colonialists in Goa, India in the 16th century and details the wholesale massacres of Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Indian Jews and non-Catholic Indian Christians by the Portuguese inquisitors. ==Details== The book is divided into two parts. Part I, titled \\"The Goa Inquisition\\", is divided into ten chapters. The first two chapters detail the Spanish Inquisition and Portuguese Inquisition in Europe providing background material and context that would lead to the inquisition in India. It explains the anti-Semitic hatred developed for Marranos Jewish people in Europe by the Inquisitors that would lead them to slaughter the Indian Jews during the Goa Inquisition. Chapter 3 begins with the advent of the Inquisition in India, with discussion of Dr. Dellon's account of the inquisition in Chapter 4. The chapters describe the wars that led to the establishment of Portuguese colonial rule in Goa, and the massacres of Hindus and Muslims during the war, typically involving mass-murders in villages, mass drownings of Muslims in rivers and other similar acts. Successive chapters in Part I describe the forced conversion of Hindus to Christianity by the Inquisition, the evolution of the policy of Christian persecution in India. The book details the organization and procedures of the Inquisition and the anti-Hindu laws that were passed in Goa during the inquisition banning Hindu religious ceremonies and customs, as well as reducing the status of Hindus to second-class citizens by banning them from public gatherings and so on. The 9th chapter discusses the various methods of torture used on Hindus, Muslims and Jews by the Inquisition, such as burning by Sulphur, Water-torture, rape, the use of pulleys to stretch victims and the \\"strappado\\" method of torture. Chapter 10 discusses the Jurisdiction and Authority of the Inquisition of Goa. Part II discusses the accounts of the Inquisition given by Dellon and Buchanan in two separate chapters. ==Peer reviews== The book was very well-reviewed by his peers. Gerald M. Moser of Penn State University said that the book was an authoritative work on the event based on accounts of European travellers and Portuguese historians.Review of The Goa Inquisition, Being a Quatercentenary Commemoration Study of the Inquisition in India by Gerald M Mosser, Journal of the American Oriental Society,84.4 (1964) The book was written one year prior to the liberation of Goa from Portuguese occupation by India, so it \\"reopened old wounds, recalling the dismal record of European religious intolerance\\" in India \\"through the most pitiless inquisition of Christendom\\".

The Central Zoo Authority (CZA) is the body of the government of India responsible for oversight of zoos. It is an affiliate member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). The CZA was formed to bring Indian zoos up to international standards. Before the CZA was formed, many zoos were poorly managed, with unsuitable animal enclosures and little or no breeding records of animals, which caused inbreeding and hybridization (genetic pollution, as in one case where an Asiatic lion were cross-bred with an African lion). The Central Zoo Authority has been constituted under the section 38A of Wild Life (Protection) Act 1972,. The Authority consists of a Chairman, ten members and a Member Secretary. The main objective of the authority is to complement the national effort in conservation of wild life. Standards and norms for housing, upkeep, health care and overall management of animals in zoos has been laid down under the Recognition of Zoo Rules, 1992. Every zoo in the country is required to obtain recognition from the Authority for its operation. The Authority evaluates the zoos with reference to the parameters prescribed under the Rules and grants recognition accordingly. Zoos which have no potential to come up to the prescribed standards and norms may be refused recognition and asked to close down. Since its inception in 1992, the Authority has evaluated 347 zoos, out of which 164 have been recognized and 183 refused recognition. Out of 183 zoos refused recognition, 92 have been closed down and their animals relocated suitably. Cases of the remaining 91 derecognized zoos are currently under review. The Authority‚Äôs role is more of a facilitator than a regulator. It, therefore, provides technical and financial assistance to such zoos which have the potential to attain the desired standard in animal management. Only such captive facilities which have neither the managerial skills nor the requisite resources are asked to close down. Apart from the primary function of grant of recognition and release of financial assistance, the Central Zoo Authority also regulates the exchange of animals of endangered category Listed under Schedule-I and II of the Wildlife Protection Act among zoos. Exchange of animals between Indian and foreign zoos is also approved by the Authority before the requisite clearances under EXIM Policy and the CITES permits are issued by the competent authority. The Authority also coordinates and implements programmes on capacity building of zoo personnel, planned breeding programmes and ex-situ research including biotechnological intervention for conservation of species for complementing in-situ conservation efforts in the country. Some of the major initiatives undertaken by the Authority since its inception include establishment of a laboratory for conservation of endangered species at Hyderabad for carrying out research in biotechnology, planned breeding of red panda and its restocking into the wild, upgrading diagnostic facilities for disease diagnosis at selected veterinary institutions and their networking with zoos on regional basis for better health care of animals. ==See also== *List of Botanical Gardens in India and the \\"Indian portion\\" of the international List of botanical gardens *Laboratory for the Conservation of Endangered Species ==Notes\\"The official List of Animals at individual Zoos in India\\", this list is maintained by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA).

The picture is a sequel to Tugboat Annie (1933). Marjorie Rambeau took over the late Marie Dressler's role, and the supporting cast features Alan Hale, Sr., Jane Wyman, and Ronald Reagan. ==Plot== Lobby card from original 1933 Tugboat Annie with Marie Dressler and Wallace Beery In this sequel in the series about \\"Tugboat\\" Annie Brennan, skipper on the Narcissus, she is still feuding with her arch-rival, Captain Bullwinkle, a Washington State tugman. Annie's volatile personality makes her come very close to losing her job as captain. The company she works for, Secoma Towing and Salvage Company, gets into real financial trouble when it fails to pay a due invoice of $25,000. Annie has to run the company while the president, Alec Severn, is at the bank trying to fix things. Annie gets explicit orders to steer clear of the new shipyard owner, millionaire J.B. Armstrong, but she still goes into negotiations with him, trying to get him to sign a profitable contract with the company. Of course the attempt turns into a complete failure, when Annie mistakes the millionaire for another man, treating him harshly and even manages to throw him into a heap of fish. The result is that the shipyard owner cancels the already existing contract with the company altogether. On top of this, Annie's rival Bullwinkle tricks her into going out to sea to salvage a ship that turns out to be a whale. She manages to save the day after all when she pulls a big ship off a ground, after Bullwinkle has failed to do the same. Annie demands $25,000 as payment for the tugging, and the invoice can be paid after all. Alec's confidence in Annie is restored and he sends her to negotiate a big job of towing a dry dock all the way to Alaska for the shipyard owner Armstrong. This negotiation too ends in failure, since he doesn't want to give the job to a woman. Shrewdly, Annie goes around this obstacle, by appointing her old friend Mike Mahoney as captain temporarily. However, it turns out Mahoney has become a helpless drunk, and Annie has to step in to save the situation after all. Still, problems keep surfacing, and Annie finds Armstrong's spoiled daughter, Peggy, on the ship. She has hidden there to accompany her lover Eddie Kent, who is Annie's young ward. During a storm at sea, Annie is then forced to leave the dock on a beach to save it from breaking and sinking in the waves. She also has to go ashore to hospitalize Mahoney, who has become very sick. When she is ashore, Bullwinkle steals the dock and claims finders keepers on it, according to general salvage rules. When the contract seems to have been breached, Alec fires Annie who was in charge of letting the dock go. Before retiring entirely, Annie looks into the salvage laws, and find that a dry dock doesn't count as a ship and the salvage claim therefore doesn't apply to it. She wins the dock back from Bullwinkle, and is reinstated as captain again.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/1622/Tugboat-Annie-Sails-Again/ ==Cast== * Marjorie Rambeau as Capt.

Eisner (5 March 1896, in Berlin ‚Äì 25 November 1983, in Paris) was a German-French writer, film critic, archivist and curator. Eisner worked initially as a film critic in Berlin, then in Paris where in 1936 she met Henri Langlois with whom she founded the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise. ==Early life, education and career== She was born Lotte Henriette Regina Eisner in Berlin, the daughter of textile manufacturer Hugo Eisner and his wife Margarethe Feodora Aron. Eisner grew up in a prosperous Jewish middle-class milieu and in 1924 obtained a Ph.D. from the University of Rostock. Her dissertation was on the development of Greek vases. In 1924, she began working as a freelance theatre critic until in 1927, Hans Feld, a friend of her brother, suggested she worked for him at Film Kurier, one of many film trade papers in Berlin. She joined the Film Kurier as a staff journalist, writing a mixture of articles and interviews and the occasional film review including the premiere of M√§dchen in Uniform. Most of the premieres and major commercial feature films were reviewed by the men on the staff but occasionally she was allowed to assess them. In 1932, with the rise of National Socialism she became proof editor and reviewer-in-chief as members of staff began to leave Germany. In March 1933, just three months after Adolf Hitler became Chancellor, Eisner fled Berlin to Paris where a sister lived. Here she lived precariously taking any job she could find (translating, babysitting etc) and working whenever possible as a freelance film critic for a variety of international journals and newspapers. In 1940, she was rounded up in the first Rafle du billet vert and taken to the Vel d'Hiv with hundreds of other single Jewish women. From there they were transported to Gurs internment camp in the Pyrenees, a concentration camp run by the French for the Germans. After a few months, she managed to escape and travelled to Montpellier where she enrolled briefly as a student before finding her way to Rodez and to Pastor Exbrayat who helped her to obtain false papers - she became Louise Escoffier from the Alsace region. She remained in touch with Henri Langlois, who was in Paris, and was secreting cans of film around the country to keep them out of the hands of the Nazis. One of those places was near Figeac in central France, in the dungeons of a Chateau Beduer. Langlois instructed Eisner to go there to preserve the films (including The Great Dictator). Eisner accomplished this in freezing cold conditions for a month before running out of money. In need of help, she managed to gain a job in a girls school in Figeac. Badly treated, she began to teach German to some Spanish girls living with the local school teacher Madame Guitard, who took her in; she stayed there until the liberation of Paris in late August 1944. After the liberation of Paris, Eisner rejoined Langlois and became Chief Curator at the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise where over a period of forty years she was responsible for collecting, saving and curating films, costumes, set designs, art work, cameras and scripts for the Cin√©math√®que archive. At the same time, Eisner began to work in private on her book L'√âcran d√©moniaque later translated as The Haunted Screen which she described in a letter to Fritz Lang as \\"a book on German silent film\\". She also published essays, articles and film reviews in journals including Revue du cin√©ma, which later became Cahiers du cin√©ma. In 1952, Eisner published her most highly acclaimed book, L'√âcran d√©moniaque, translated into English as The Haunted Screen in 1969: her study of the influence of the spirit of German Expressionism on cinema. Eisner subsequently published studies of F.W. Murnau (1964) and of Fritz Lang (1976), with Lang's collaboration. Murnau was awarded the Prix Armand Tallier in 1965 In the late 1950s, she became a friend of and mentor of Werner Herzog and other leading young German film makers, including Wim Wenders, Volker Schl√∂ndorff and Herbert Achternbusch. When Eisner fell gravely ill in 1974, Herzog walked from Munich to Paris in winter. Herzog commented: \\"It was clear to me that if I did it, Eisner wouldn't die.\\" Eisner appears in Herzog's autobiographical documentary Portrait Werner Herzog (1986). In his February 2, 2016 interview at Stanford University, Herzog claims that 8 years later she complained to him of her infirmities and asked: \\"I am saturated with life. There is still this spell upon me that I must not die - can you lift it?\\" He says that he did, and she died 8 days later.http://www.openculture.com/2016/08/werner-herzog-tells-a-book-club-why- the-peregrine-is-one-of-his-favorite-books.html Wenders' film Paris, Texas (1984) is dedicated to her memory.

At least one station currently branded as Hank FM does not fall in line with the format of the other stations, using the brand name for an adult hits format more similar to the Jack or Bob formats (likewise, there are a few country stations that brand with Bob).

The movie was directed by Phil Rosen, and is also known as Tugboat Annie's Son. The original film starred Marie Dressler, Wallace Beery, Robert Young, and Maureen O'Sullivan. The first sequel, called Tugboat Annie Sails Again, was released in 1940 starring Marjorie Rambeau as Annie, Alan Hale, Sr. as Horatio Bullwinkle, Jane Wyman, and Ronald Reagan. There is also a 1957 Canadian-filmed television series, The Adventures of Tugboat Annie, starring Minerva Urecal. ==Plot== Lobby card from original 1933 Tugboat Annie with Marie Dressler and Wallace Beery Right after the war has ended, tugboats are allowed to freely operate again in the US coastal waters. The owner of Secoma Towing & Salvage, Alec Severn (Joseph Crehan), starts searching for the famous Tugboat Annie Brennan (Jane Darwell), to incorporate her back as the captain of his fleet of tugboats. Severn is unaware that captain Bullwinkle (Edgar Kennedy), Annie‚Äôs long time rival, has his own agenda and wants to take Annie‚Äôs place as captain of the fleet. Bullwinkle intentionally gives Severn the wrong address to Annie, in an attempt to put her in bad standing when she doesn‚Äôt respond to Severn‚Äôs letter and request. Somehow, Annie still gets in touch with Severn and is appointed captain. She starts hiring his crew, an experienced lot of sailors: Pinto (Mantan Moreland), Shiftless (Jack Norton), Missouri Jones (Barton Yarborough) and Johnny Webb (Hardie Albright). Work commences and Annie runs across an orphan named Susan Henley (Saundra Berkova). She is a violin virtuose, and since Annie has worked with her father before the war, and very much would like a child of her own, she wants to adopt Susan as her own. Severn disagrees and claims the child would be better off on shore with his own family. Instead Annie gets to adopt a juvenile delinquent boy, with the help of a judge. It turns out the boy, whose name is Terry Jordan (Charles Gordon), is quite hostile towards Annie, and both she and her crew have difficulties in putting up with his antics. Susan gets to play for a famous conductor, a womanizing musician, Alfred Puccini (Fritz Feld) whom Annie knew a long time ago, under a different name. Meanwhile, Annie still struggles in winning the heart of Terry, who resists all her friendly attempts. When Annie gets a very important and acute mission, Bullwinkle secretly empties her fuel tanks and sabotages her radio communication so that he can steal the job. Terry gets the blame for the sabotage, and gets into a fight with one of the crew members because of this. When Terry discovers sees that the man he‚Äôs fighting is a wounded veteran, he lets the man win. After this, he is respected by the whole crew as a decent boy. Terry finds out that Bullwinkle was the one who sabotaged the tugboat, and forces him to admit this to Annie. Terry then leaves the ship, leaving a note of explanation for his behaviour and departure. he says he will be back one day. Annie starts focusing more on Susan‚Äôs upcoming violin concert. The debut is a success, despite the fact that Susan is only eleven years old. A fire rages the tugboat when Annie returns from the concert, and Terry is back with the crew to help put it out. Even Bullwinkle helps out. When the tugboat tows an oil tanker that has caught fire, and the boat is at risk because of the huge flames, Johnny dies saving Terry‚Äôs life. The hardship makes Annie want to quit as captain, but Severn and Terry persuades her to stay on. Susan gets a contract with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and Annie makes up with Bullwinkle again.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/70253/Captain-Tugboat- Annie/ ==Cast== *Jane Darwell as Tugboat Annie *Edgar Kennedy as Captain Bullwinkle *Charles Gordon as Terry Jordan *Mantan Moreland as Pinto *Pamela Blake as Marion Graves *Hardie Albright as Johnny Webb *H.

She was soon developed into a movie character, depicted in three films and portrayed by a different actress in each (Marie Dressler in Tugboat Annie, 1933; Marjorie Rambeau in Tugboat Annie Sails Again, 1940; and Jane Darwell in Captain Tugboat Annie, 1945). ==Development== In 1954, a television series was commissioned by the independent American production company TPA. The pilot took two years to complete, at a then-record cost of $129,000. Elsa Lanchester, Jay C. Flippen, and Chill Wills were all in line for major roles at one point or another at this early stage. The series was filmed in Toronto harbor and was first shown in Canada, having attracted ratings good enough to interest American television stations. What had succeeded in Canada proved a disappointment in the United States, where the viewing audiences had presumably become accustomed to greater sophistication than the simplistic humor of this series. The show was also screened in the United Kingdom, but is now largely forgotten. ==Plot== Annie Brennan, widowed and the former skipper of a garbage scow, now captains a ship owned by the Severn Tugboat Company.

At the same time, they began conceptualizing Thee Majesty as a spoken word-based project springing from the Splinter Test project with PTV alumnus Larry Thrasher. The first major Thee Majesty performance was in 1998 in Stockholm, Sweden at an international spoken word festival that included Michael Gira and Wanda Coleman amongst other notable spoken word artists. That first Thee Majesty lineup for the Sweden show included P-Orridge, Larry Thrasher, Bachir Attar, and Chandra Shukla. Later in New York, P-Orridge met Bryin Dall (4th Sign of the Apocalypse, A Murder of Angels, Dream Into Dust) and began doing live performances in New York and San Francisco and tours with the industrial band Pigface. Thee Majesty's second major performance was at the Royal Festival Hall in London, England on 1 May 1999, which was also the \\"final\\" show of PTV. The show was called \\"Time's Up\\" which was also the name of the new project's debut CD, released on the same date by Dall's label The Order of the Suffering Clown via World Serpent Distribution. Since then, Thee Majesty has remained an intermittent project, only playing sporadic festivals, art events, and intimate venues in Europe and the US, and releasing very few original studio albums. In 2009 Thee Majesty played a critically acclaimed show expounding on a transgender creation story theme at the Centre Pompidou with P-Orridge, Thrasher, Dall and Edley in the lineup. ==Members== Besides P-Orridge and Dall, Larry Thrasher has performed several live shows including two tours of Europe. They were joined in 2004 by P-Orridge's wife, Lady Jaye Breyer P-Orridge, and briefly by Morrison Edley (Toilet B√∂ys). The project remains a vehicle for P-Orridge's semi-freeform rants and concepts, supported by Dall's guitar and sample soundscapes along with Thrasher's tabla playing and noise soundscapes, at times augmented by some combination of other players. Edley, now known as \\"Electric Eddie\\", has focused mainly on PTVIII, the latest incarnation of Psychic TV. Lady Jaye died on Tuesday 9 October 2007. ==Discography== Thee Majesty's discography is a bit confusing. As noted above, Time's Up was the name of multiple releases and events including the debut album. P-Orridge has also opted to use the name on reissues of works predating the band's inception. A Hollow Cost, At Stockholm, and Thee Fractured Garden were originally Psychic TV or Splinter Test releases, but in reissues they were given new artwork and credited to both Genesis P-Orridge and Thee Majesty. Mary Never Wanted Jesus was a special Christmas-themed limited release that contains some different tracks and running orders on the vinyl and CD versions. Vitruvian Pan is the band's second proper full-length studio album, though it contains elements from live recordings.

Katsoudas most recently released the 2015 album Under a DubWitch Moon under the moniker DubWitch. ==Biography Early life and career beginnings === Stella started in Chicago, Illinois doing back up vocals for a number of local bands including Chemlab's album East Side Militia singing on \\"Electric Molecular\\" and 16 Volt on LetDownCrush, singing on \\"Swarm\\". In 1996 Stella self-released Drown Me in You via her own label \\"Katharsis Records\\". Additional collaborations included Die Warzau as part of a side project with Van Christie which led to a collaborative effort on the album Soularium. When working on her record at Real World Studios Stella wrote two tracks with Joseph Arthur \\"Butterfly\\" and \\"Hanging Around\\" during which time she derived much inspiration from him. Peter Gabriel wanted to use a couple of producers she was working with to program a couple of tracks for him. He also worked on a song on the Soularium album called \\"Blind\\" that she had written in Chicago with Preston Klik and Thomas Cray while in the short-live trio, Juniper. There it was, like a mantra, he sang over and over \\"shine like the sun, shine like the sun.‚Äù Michael Rand former Kid Rock and Blue October manager secured the Sister Soleil recording contract with Doug Morris then CEO of Universal Music Group. When Stella got her record deal with Universal, Stella flew Corey Taylor into Real World Studios to record a song called \\"Liar\\". When Sister Soleil toured for the Soularium album in the midwest Corey would always come to do the show live with her, ending in a fist fight on the floor, their idea of an antithesis to \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\". Gaining a lot of recognition in the midwest, thanks to radio DJ Sophia John of the once 107.5 KKDM Radio Station in Des Moines, Iowa, Sister Soleil had a lot of airplay featuring top songs \\"Red\\" and \\"Torch\\". Performing at the local radio station's music festival, \\"The Dotfest\\", the band received a lot of great feedback. However, at the time of her record release there was a different scene that was more popular. ===1997-2001: Universal Records=== To gain inspiration for her next album, Stella took a two-year trek around the world, during which she read, wrote in journals, and practiced yoga while recording in five different countries. \\"I spent two years by myself,\\" she said. \\"[The label] was really supportive that I needed to go across the Atlantic to reinvent myself and to find my voice and my writing muse.\\" In 2001, Stella was transformed into \\"Stella Soleil\\" (Soleil is French for sun) a Pop princess ready to compete with Britney Spears, Mandy Moore, Jessica Simpson, and Christina Aguilera who were all very popular at the time. The record went through many different phases. While the tracks \\"Imperfect\\" and \\"Stand Up\\" were being worked on at such well known studios in London known as Milo Studios and Air Studios the track \\"Pretty Young Thing\\" was being worked on in the States. Once the tracks were finished, at last minute Universal decided to have her do a cover song. The first single released was \\"Kiss Kiss\\", the English version of \\"≈ûƒ±marƒ±k\\" originally sung by Turkish star Tarkan. The song's popularity spread after first being played on Y-100, a South Floridian radio station. \\"Kiss Kiss\\" was one of Stella's biggest hits reaching #27 on the Billboard Top 40 charts in the US. On May 1, 2001, Stella released her 2nd album Dirty Little Secret. Despite the success of 'Kiss Kiss' the album barely charted at #106 on Billboard though it did reach #2 on the Heatseekers chart. However her song \\"Stand Up\\" was featured on the WB Fall Line Up as background music. A poll was held on her official website asking what the next single should be. \\"Pretty Young Thing\\" was chosen and released to the radio though it never charted. The following year, after low chart positions and a failed follow up single, Stella and Universal parted ways. Many fans criticized Stella's sound during this time. They considered it 'selling out' and too 'poppy'. Unlike her fellow (and younger) Pop princesses, Stella was able to write her own music and had years of experience under her belt. Stella herself has expressed dissatisfaction with this era due to her lack of creative control. In her MySpace biography, it states \\"Dirty Little Secret was a hit. However, Stella decided to drop the pop act in search of something she could relate to easier.\\" ===Side projects=== In 1999, Stella remixed the Nine Inch Nails song \\"A Warm Place\\", which was intended for use on the 1999 film Stigmata soundtrack.

In April 2007, Crahan, who had known Stella since Slipknot began performing in Des Moines in 1995, invited her to become the lead vocalist for Dirty Little Rabbits. She accepted. Since then, Dirty Little Rabbits have performed in Omaha, Des Moines, Chicago, as well as being on a month-long tour with Stone Sour and Sydonia in August 2007. ===The Return of Sister Soleil=== Stella resumed working under the moniker Sister Soleil and self-released \\"Eskimo\\" in May 2011. In late 2011 Stella put together a full band line up, reuniting with original Sister Soleil member and guitarist Grey Parker on bass, and adding new members Eli Grey on Guitar and Programming, and Peter Bisinov on guitars, drums, and programming. This lineup released the single \\"Even at a Whisper (Your Voice Is Power)\\".
