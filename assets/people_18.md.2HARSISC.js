Although the song was widely perceived to be about prostitutes, Clapton has stated it was actually about three girls who lived on The Avenue in Rose Bay in Sydney when he was living the next street over. Clapton was happy for the misunderstanding to continue, saying, \\"My manager at the time simply said 'Sex sells.

As of 2019, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency describes more than 7,800 Americans as \\"unaccounted for\\" from the Korean War. The United States Armed Forces estimates that 5,300 of these troops went missing in North Korea. ==Operation Glory== After the Korean Armistice, North Korea returned the remains of more than 3,000 Americans in what was termed Operation Glory in 1954. At the same time, US Graves Registration teams recovered remains from South Korea. The US identified thousands of these remains. In 1956, 848 sets of remains that could not be identified were buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, known as the Punchbowl Cemetery, in Honolulu, Hawaii. Others were later buried there as \\"unknown soldiers\\". Another \\"unknown soldier\\" was buried in the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery. The remains of all of these \\"unknown soldiers\\" were treated with formaldehyde, which, in later decades, made their identification through DNA testing difficult. ==After the Cold War== From 1990 to 1994, North Korea uncovered and returned 208 boxes of remains. The United States Department of Defense's scientists estimate that the remains of as many as 400 people could be held in these boxes. By 2018, 182 people had been identified from the remains in these boxes. In 1996 the US Department of Defense began dispatching teams to North Korea, carrying out 33 joint operations with the North Koreans and recovering about 220 sets of remains. The US government suspended these operations in 2005, officially because of concerns relating to the safety of US personnel. From 1996 to 2005, the US paid North Korea over US$20 million, ostensibly to cover the costs of these operations. In 2007, North Korea sent home the remains of another seven US troops, at the time of the visit of an unofficial US delegation headed by US politician Bill Richardson. During the presidency of Barack Obama (whose term was 2009‚Äì2017), the issue was raised without results. In 2016, North Korean officials made an offer to return the remains of about 200 US personnel, but this was ignored. ==The Singapore Summit and beyond== In the Singapore Summit in 2018, Donald Trump of the US and Kim Jong-un of North Korea committed \\"to recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified\\". On 27 July North Korea handed over 55 boxes of human remains. The remains were saluted in a ceremony in their honor by US soldiers. The North Korean authorities reported to the U.S. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency that they couldn't be sure how many individuals were represented in the 55 boxes. There was only one dog tag among the remains. Other servicemen could be identified through matching DNA, chest X-rays, and dental records. Twenty boxes were retrieved from the site of the Battle of Unsan, and 35 from the site of the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. There were boots, canteens, and other equipment among the remains. By May 2019, six US servicemen had been identified from the remains in the 55 boxes. By October 2019, it was reported that 35‚Äì40 servicemen had been identified. After the failure of the Hanoi Summit, the US suspended the program. At the September 2018 inter-Korean summit, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un agreed to a joint operation to recover remains in part of the Korean Demilitarized Zone. The South Korean Ministry of National Defense estimated that the remains of approximately 200 South Korean soldiers, 100 American and French soldiers, and an unknown number of North Korean and Chinese soldiers are buried in the area. The remains of just over a thousand American troops are thought to be buried in or near the DMZ. On 28 July 2019, President Moon said once excavation was complete for Arrowhead Ridge, they would expand it to cover the whole of the DMZ. ==References== Category:Aftermath of the Korean War Category:American military personnel killed in the Korean War Category:Funeral transport Category:Korean War prisoners of war Category:United States in the Korean War Category:North Korea‚ÄìUnited States relations ","title":"Recovery of US human remains from the Korean War"},{"id":"61307450","text":"Towera Vinkhumbo (born 14 February 1991), also referred to as Towera Vinkhumbo-Nyirenda or Towera Nyirenda, is a Malawi netball international and a Malawi women's football international.

The name referred to its location to the south of Ru River (Ê±ùÊ∞¥), a historical river that flowed into the Huai. Runan was part of the Huaiyang Kingdom in early Western Han dynasty. In 156 BC, Runan was granted to Liu Fei, son of the reigning Emperor Jing as a principality. A year later, Fei's fief was changed to Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ), and Runan became a commandery.Book of Han, Chapter 53. In late Western Han dynasty, it administered 37 counties, Pingyu (Âπ≥Ëºø), Yang'an (ÈôΩÂÆâ), Yangcheng (ÈôΩÂüé), Liqiang (ÈÉ¶Âº∑), Fubo (ÂØåÊ≥¢), N√ºyang (Â•≥ÈôΩ), Tongyang (ÈÆ¶ÈôΩ), Wufang (Âê≥Êàø), Ancheng (ÂÆâÊàê), Nandun (ÂçóÈ†ì), Langling (ÊúóÈôµ), Xiyang (Á¥∞ÈôΩ), Yichun (ÂÆúÊò•), N√ºyin (Â•≥Èô∞), Xincai (Êñ∞Ëî°), Xinxi (Êñ∞ÊÅØ), Quyang (ÁÅàÈôΩ), Qisi (ÊúüÊÄù), Shenyang (ÊÖéÈôΩ), Shen (ÊÖé), Zhaoling (Âè¨Èôµ), Yiyang (ÂºãÈôΩ), Xiping (Ë•øÂπ≥), Shangcai (‰∏äËî°), Qin (Êµ∏), Xihua (Ë•øËèØ), Changping (Èï∑Âπ≥), Xilu (ÂÆúÁ•ø), Xiang (È†Ö), Xinqi (Êñ∞ÈÉ™), Guide (Ê≠∏Âæ∑), Xinyang (Êñ∞ÈôΩ), Anchang (ÂÆâÊòå), Anyang (ÂÆâÈôΩ), Boyang (ÂçöÈôΩ), Chengyang (ÊàêÈôΩ) and Dingling (ÂÆöÈôµ).

In 280 AD, Runan Commandery retained 15 counties with the population was 21,500 households, while the three commanderies together had a population of 46,700 households. During Emperor Hui's reign, two new commanderies, Xincai and Nandun, were established in the region.Book of Jin, Chapter 14. Under Northern Wei, the commandery consisted of 8 counties, and the Book of Wei recorded a population of 37,061, or 15,889 households.Book of Wei, Chapter 30.

The play, in which one woman is willing to sacrifice herself to save a close female friend, was described as resembling the works of Shakespeare and, while set in Savoy, had no historical basis. The work concerned the fictional Duke of Savoy and his son Prince Alvaro (the latter played by Thomas Betterton, who in the role was resplendent in the suit worn by Charles II at his Coronation earlier that year. Henry Harris played Prince Prospero and wore the Coronation suit of the James, Duke of York, while Joseph Price, who played Leonell, son of the Duke of Parma, wore a suit provided by the Earl of Oxford.Sir William Davenant, Dramatists of the Restoration: Sir William D'Avenant, Volume 3, William Paterson, Edinburgh and H.

The Duke of Savoy wishes to execute her in revenge for the death of his brother in battle against the Duke of Milan ten years before. Unbeknown to him, his brother is still alive having been captured by the Duke of Milan who holds him as a guest to prevent further wars. Alvaro, son of the Duke of Savoy, has a love for Evandra that is so strong that he can \\"march strong, through hideous gulfs, through numerous herds of angry lions\\". Alvaro orders his friend Prospero to hide Evandra in a cave at his house to protect her from the Duke, his father. Prospero comes to love her. In Prospero's house she finds a companion in Melora, the sister of Leonell; both are the children of the Duke of Parma and also are captives. Leonell also comes to love her. While the three men contest between themselves as to who will die for her (she has a price on her head), she locks two of her suitors in a cave and convinces the third, Leonell, to guard them while she hands herself in to the authorities. This causes a love/honour conflict for Leonell, who must decide whether to stay and guard his rivals or follow the object of his love. In the end honour triumphs and he stays on guard until Evandra has left. On their release Prospero wants to fight Leonell, but Alvaro reminds him that they all share a common bond through their love for Evandra and the three vow friendship. Melora, too, tries to save Evandra by claiming to be her and be executed in her place. Confused as to who is the real Evandra, the Duke decides to have them both executed. At Court two Ambassadors plead unsuccessfully for the lives of the two young women. There is an exchange of noble sentiments after which two of the love rivals stand aside, Evandra's father the Duke of Milan is revealed disguised as the First Ambassador while the Duke's supposedly dead brother turns up alive and well similarly disguised as the Second Ambassador, Alvaro marries Melora while Evandra marries Leonell.Howard S.

She owns Darjeeling Express restaurant in London's Soho and was profiled on the sixth season of the documentary series Chef's Table. In June 2019 Business Insider named her number 1 on their list of \\"100 Coolest People in Food and Drink\\". == Early life and education == Khan was born in July 1969 and grew up in Calcutta. She has an older sister and a younger brother. Her family lamented the birth of a second daughter instead of the desired son. According to Khan \\"there is a deafening silence\\" in India about the disappointment a family feels at having a second daughter. She has said that she and her siblings were treated equally by her parents, and that she and her mother \\"made peace while I was still very young.\\" Her father is Rajput from western Uttar Pradesh. Her mother is from West Bengal and had a catering business in the 1970s and 1980s. Khan moved with her husband to Cambridge in 1991. She had never learned to cook and missed the dishes she had grown up eating. She first started learning to cook from an aunt who lived in Cambridge. After her aunt died, Khan returned to India for a visit of a few months to continue lessons with her mother and the family's cook. In 1996 her husband moved to SOAS University of London to teach, and Khan started studying law at King's College London. She graduated with a PhD in British Constitutional Law in 2012. == Career == In 2012, after obtaining her PhD, Khan started offering a series of private supper clubs in her home. Vivek Singh attended one and invited her to host a pop-up at his restaurant, The Cinnamon Club. In 2015, after her family complained, she moved the supper clubs to a Soho pub, Sun and 13 Cantons, and started serving lunches instead. She struggled early on to lead her team of home cooks, mostly local immigrants working for the first time in a professional kitchen, but then a review by Fay Maschler helped bring in customers. Interior of Darjeeling Express In 2016 Simon Quayle, a regular customer and executive director of Shaftesbury, offered her the opportunity to compete for a lease in Soho. When an investor backed out, Khan's husband gave her the money she needed, although he disapproved of the business. Khan opened Darjeeling Express, which offers Indian Rajput and Bengali home cooking specialties, in 2017 in Soho. She named the restaurant after a train she rode as a child during summer holidays. Her team consisted of Asian immigrant women who all had full-time jobs and were never trained professionally; they worked for Khan on their days off but were able to cut back hours at their other jobs and eventually give them up altogether. Most of the all-female kitchen staff at the restaurant are second daughters. All are South Asian. Food & Wine called Darjeeling Express a \\"smash hit\\". In 2017, Khan was profiled by the BBC in a short documentary. Khan, about to open a dum biryani In 2018 her cookbook, Asma's Indian Kitchen, was published by Pavilion Books. The San Francisco Chronicle called it a \\"stellar debut\\". It was shortlisted for the 2018 World Gourmand award for Best Indian Cookbook. In April 2018 Khan was approached by Brian McGinn, producer of Chef's Table, to be profiled on the series. Filming started in London and India in July with Zia Mandviwalla directing. Khan recalls Mandviwalla, who was born in Mumbai and lives in New Zealand, \\"did not ask me pointless questions about my husband and marriage, I did not need to explain what my mother meant to me, she got it.\\" The programme first aired in February 2019. Khan is the first British chef to be featured. The series' sixth season's theme is \\"the journey home\\". The season, which included Khan's episode, was nominated for an Emmy in the outstanding documentary section. According to Bloomberg it became difficult to get a reservation at Darjeeling Express after the series aired. In May 2019 Khan was featured on NPR's The Splendid Table. In June 2019 Business Insider named her number 1 on their list of \\"100 Coolest People in Food and Drink\\". == Philanthropy == On Sundays, when Darjeeling Express is closed, Khan offers free use of the premises to women who are aspiring chefs and restaurateurs who would like to host supper clubs. Khan's restaurants support a non-profit, Second Daughters Fund, which encourages families in India to celebrate the births of second daughters by sending packages of sweet treats to be shared with neighbors. In July 2019, to mark her 50th birthday, Khan planned to travel to Northern Iraq to open an all- women cafe for survivors of ISIS. == Personal life == Khan is married to Mushtaq, an academic. According to Khan, he is not a fan of her food, preferring simple dishes and finding hers too complex. The couple have two sons. She is Muslim. == References == Category:Indian emigrants to England Category:British chefs Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:British restaurateurs Category:Cookbook writers Category:Women cookbook writers Category:People from Kolkata Category:Alumni of The Dickson Poon School of Law Category:Businesspeople from London Category:Indian chefs ","title":"Asma Khan"},{"id":"61307635","text":"The 2019‚Äì20 Eerste Klasse season was a season of the Eerste Klasse. ==Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic== On 12 March 2020, all football leagues were suspended until 31 March as the Dutch government forbade events due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands.

General Olinto M. Barsanti stationed the 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, in the lowlands to help South Vietnamese forces defend Revolutionary Development areas and to prevent the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and Vietcong (VC) from acquiring rice during the summer harvest. The 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division and the 3rd Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division, operating in the foothills southwest of Hu·∫ø, conducted spoiling attacks into Base Area 114 from the bases they had built along Route 547 in March and April. The division also exchanged mobile training teams with the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 1st Division. ==Operation== At 12:30 on 21 May, a PAVN battalion, augmented by personnel from a sapper demolition team, launched a ground attack against Camp Eagle, following a covering barrage of more than 400 rounds of 122mm rockets, 82mm mortars, B-40 and B-41 rocket propelled grenades (RPGs) into the Division headquarters area. The ground attack struck the southwest edge of the perimeter and was beaten back by headquarters troops of the 1st Brigade, members of the 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment and helicopter gunships. At dawn a sweep of the area revealed 54 PAVN dead and 16 weapons captured, also found were 40 satchel charges, 30 bangalore torpedoes, and 50 RPG rounds. Damage to the base area was light. Later on 21 May the 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry Regiment repulsed a probe of their night defensive perimeter with artillery and small arms. 31 enemy dead and 12 weapons were found on the perimeter the next morning. In late May the first of a series of weapons and equipment caches was unearthed deep in the triple canopy jungle west of Hu·∫ø. The 1/327th Infantry uncovered three light artillery pieces, two anti-aircraft guns and one truck near Firebase Veghel. Three days later another cache was discovered southwest of Hu·∫ø by the 2/327th Infantry, with more than 230 individual and crew-served weapons were pulled from storage bunkers dug into the jungle floor camouflaged with several feet of thick, overgrown brush. During the same period the 1/327th Infantry found and destroyed a fleet of 54 enemy trucks southwest of Firebase Veghel. At 11:30 on 30 May Company B, 2nd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, while on a reconnaissance in force, engaged an estimated enemy platoon which was shortly reinforced by a company size unit. Company B 2/502nd Infantry called for airstrikes and the action continued until 13:53 resulting in 2 US killed and 3 PAVN killed. At 12:45 on 2 June Company A 2nd Battalion, 17th Cavalry Regiment, while on a reconnaissance in force received small-arms and rocket=propelled grenade fire from an estimated enemy company in bunkers. Three airstrikes were called on the enemy and Companies B and C, 2nd Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment moved to reinforce Company A 2/17th Cavalry. The contact terminated at 16:50 with 2 US and 41 VC killed. At 07:30 on 16 June Company B, 2/327th Infantry, engaged an unknown number of enemy in bunkers. Artillery was directed upon the enemy. Results of the contact were 5 US killed and 27 PAVN killed and 21 captured. Cumulative results until the end of June were 87 US killed, 1021 PAVN/VC killed and 186 captured. On its arrival in I Corps, the 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment had been assigned security missions and areas of operation southwest of Hu·∫ø. On 8 October Company A, 1/506th found 40 decomposed enemy bodies in a stream bed at grid reference YD 764073 (), they appeared to have been killed by artillery. From 12-20 October 1/506th Infantry conducted combined operations with the Hac Bao reconnaissance company of the ARVN 1st Division in the \\"Salad Bowl\\" area at grid reference YD 718046 (). During this operation they located seven weapons caches and a PAVN/VC base and hospital area. On 23 October the reconnaissance platoon of the 1/506th Infantry found another large weapons cache with 80 individual and one crew-served weapon. On 26 October Company A 1/506th Infantry discovered a base area and over 80 bodies that had been dead for 2-3 months. On 26 October the 3rd Brigade was ordered to move north to Camp Evans to take over from the 1st Cavalry Division which was moving south to III Corps in Operation Liberty Canyon. On 1 December a unit of the 1st Brigade 101st Airborne, discovered the bodies of 15 enemy soldiers in graves while searching an area east southeast of Ph√∫ L·ªôc District. At 19:30 on 2 February, Camp Eagle, the 101st Airborne headquarters located southeast of Hu·∫ø, received 5 rounds of 122mm rockets. Aerial rocket artillery attacked the suspected firing location with unknown results. On the afternoon of 27 February an element of the 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne discovered a 4.5-ton munitions cache while searching a jungle area south of Hu·∫ø. The cache contained 453 82mm mortar rounds, 264 60mm mortar rounds, 250lbs of TNT and 7,000 rounds of small arms ammunition. ==Aftermath== The operation terminated on 28 February 1969. US losses were 175 killed while PAVN losses were 3,299 killed and 853 captured. 3,379 individual weapons and 322 crew-served weapons were captured. ==References== Category:1968 in Vietnam Category:1969 in Vietnam Nevada Eagle Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1968 Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1969 Category:History of Th·ª´a Thi√™n-Hu·∫ø Province ","title":"Operation Nevada Eagle"},{"id":"61307803","text":"The Jameh Mosque of Kabir Neyriz is related to the Seljuq dynasty and is located in the Neyriz. == Sources == Category:Mosques in Iran Category:Mosque buildings with domes Category:National Works of Iran ","title":"Jameh Mosque of Kabir Neyriz"},{"id":"61307809","text":"Pelletstown railway station is a railway station under construction on the Western Commuter line in the Cabra area of Dublin, Ireland.

Panoramic ultrasonography of a proximal biceps tendon rupture. Top image shows the contralateral normal side, and lower image shows a retracted muscle, with a hematoma filling out the proximal space. A biceps tendon rupture is a complete or partial rupture of a tendon of the biceps brachii muscle. It can affect the distal tendon, or either/both of the proximal tendons, attached to the long and short head of the muscle, respectively. ==Causes== A biceps tendon rupture may occur during athletic activities, however avulsion injuries of the distal biceps tendon are frequently occupational in nature and sustained during forceful, eccentric contraction of the biceps muscle while lifting. ==Treatment== Acute rupture of the distal biceps tendon can be treated nonoperatively with acceptable results, but because the injury can lead to 30% loss of elbow flexion strength and 30-50% loss of forearm supination strength, surgical repair is generally recommended. Complete distal biceps tears are commonly treated with re-attachment of the biceps tendon to its native insertion on the tuberosity of the radius using bone tunnels, suture buttons, or suture anchors. Proximal ruptures of the long head of the biceps tendon can be surgically addressed by two different techniques. Biceps tenodesis includes release of the long head of the biceps tendon off of its insertion on the glenoid and re-attachment by screw or suture anchor fixation to the humerus. Biceps tenotomy consists of simple release of the long head of the biceps without reattachment to the humerus, allowing the tendon to retract into the soft tissues of the proximal upper arm. Degeneration of the tendon can cause partial tears and are rarely associated with a traumatic event. Treatment of a biceps tear depends on the severity of the injury. In most cases, the muscle will heal over time with no corrective surgery. Applying cold pressure and using anti-inflammatory medications will ease pain and reduce swelling. More severe injuries require surgery and post-op physical therapy to regain strength and functionality in the muscle. Corrective surgeries of this nature are typically reserved for elite athletes who rely on a complete recovery. ==References== Category:Dislocations, sprains and strains Category:Sports injuries ","title":"Biceps tendon rupture"},{"id":"61307816","text":"Eucalyptus globulus subsp. globulus, commonly known as the Tasmanian blue gum, southern blue gum, or blue gum, is a subspecies of tree that is endemic to southeastern Australia.

The bark is mostly smooth, shedding in long strips to leave a white or greyish surface. There is sometimes rough, partially shed bark at the base of the trunk and ribbons of shedding bark in the upper branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are more or less square in cross-section, with a prominent wing on each corner. The juvenile leaves are sessile, arranged in opposite pairs, elliptic to egg-shaped, the lower surface covered by a white, waxy bloom, long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, glossy green, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged singly in leaf axils on a thick peduncle that is sessile or up to long. Mature buds are glaucous, conical and warty, long and wide with four ribs along the sides and a flattened operculum that has a central knob. Flowering occurs between May and January and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, sessile, hemispherical to conical capsule, square in cross-section, long and wide with four longitudinal ridges and the valves at about rim level. ==Taxonomy and naming== Tasmanian blue gum was first formally described in 1800 by Jacques Labillardi√®re in his book, Relation du Voyage √† la Recherche de la P√©rouse.

Born in Vienna, he began his career as an actor and singer and appeared in various provincial theatres in Germany. In 1906, he composed the first of his twelve operettas. Gfaller was married to the operetta singer Therese Wiet and often appeared with her in Leipzig where the couple were based for most of their careers. In 1943 he retired to their house in Bad Ischl where he died at the age of 89. ==Life and career== Gfaller was born in Vienna, the son of a restaurant proprietor. He began acting in children's roles at the Carltheater in the suburbs of Vienna and then attended the Dorr'sche Theatre and Music School. As an adult he worked as an actor and tenor singer in musical theatre and operetta in various provincial theatres in Germany and in what is now the Czech Republic, including Rudolfstadt, Wiesbaden, Darmstadt, Magdeburg, and Stralsund. In 1906, he composed his first operetta, Der Fr√ºhlingsonkel which premiered at the municipal theatre in Stralsund. He then relocated to Leipzig where he continued his career as an operetta singer. It was there that he met his future wife, the soprano Therese Wiet. The couple married in 1912 and would often perform together after their marriage. Gfaller's second operetta, Der Windelkavalier, premiered to considerable success in 1914 at the Neues Operetten-Theater in Leipzig. He went on to compose nine more between 1915 and 1944, many of them while staying at his country house in Bad Ischl. In 1926, he became the founding artistic director of the Leipzig theatre where both he and his wife were based until their retirement. A critic for Die Weltb√ºhne noted in 1931 that the couple could have had international careers had they not remained \\"riveted\\" to Leipzig. When the theatre was destroyed by Allied bombing in 1943, Rudi and Therese retired to their house in Bad Ischl and lived there for the rest of their lives. They were both active in the musical life of the town, which hosted an annual Operetta Week festival after the war. Gfaller also became a board member of the Gesellschaft f√ºr Operette, Musical und Unterhaltungsmusik (Society for Operetta, Musical Theatre, and Entertainment Music). Gfaller came out of retirement in the early 1960s to compose his final operetta, Der feurige Elias. The phrase in the title, \\"feurige Elias\\" (\\"fiery Elijah\\" in English), is a German colloquial term for steam locomotives. The libretto is based on the real-life closing in 1957 of the narrow-gauge railway line that had connected Bad Ischl with Salzburg since 1893. The closure led to protests, rallies, and a final silent march by the residents of the town and the railway's employees. Composed as a \\"folk operetta\\", it premiered in Bad Ischl in 1963 with a cast that included the veteran operetta singers and and was broadcast later that year on Austrian television. Therese Wiet died in 1971. Rudi Gfaller died a year later at the age of 89. They are buried together in the Bad Ischl Cemetery. ==Works== *Der Fr√ºhlingsonkel, operetta in 3 acts, libretto by Karl Schmalz; premiered Stralsund, Stadttheater. 1906 *Der Windelkavalier, operetta in 3 acts, libretto by Karl Dibbern and Martin Martin; premiered Leipzig, Neues Operetten-Theater, 1914 *Der dumme August, operetta in 3 acts, libretto by Bruno Decker and Robert Pohl; premiered Altenburg, Hoftheater, 1915 *Der Mann seiner Frau, operetta in 3 acts, libretto by Bruno Decker and Robert Pohl; premiered Frankfurt, Albert- Schumann-Theater, 1917 *Eine Walzernacht, operetta in 3 acts, libretto by Hans Bachwitz; premiered Erfurt, Stadttheater, 1918 *Wenn dich die b√∂sen Buben locken, musical farce in 3 acts, libretto by Hans Bachwitz and Hans Sturm; premiered Kassel, Residenztheater, 1919 *Der gl√ºckliche Kiebitz, operetta in 3 acts, libretto by Bruno Decker and Robert Pohl; premiered Nuremberg, Stadttheater am Ring, 1921 *Hallo, hier Garmisch, revue operetta in two parts and 11 scenes, libretto by Carl Bretschneider; premiered F√ºrth, Stadttheater, 1937 *Die Sacher-Pepi (originally titled Die Gr√§fin bittesch√∂n), operetta in 3 acts, libretto by Ernst Welisch; premiered Leipzig, Neues Operetten-Theater, 1939 *Venedig in Wien, operetta in 3 acts, libretto by Ernst Welisch; premiered Chemnitz, Central-Theater, 1941 *Die himmelblaue Stadt, operetta in 3 acts, libretto by and Ernst Welisch; premiered Ostrava, M√§hrisch- Schlesisches Theater, 1944 *', folk operetta in 3 acts, libretto by Hermann Demel and Maximilian Gottwald; premiered Bad Ischl, Kurhaus, 1963 ==ReferencesExternal links== *The grave of Therese Wiet and Rudi Gfaller in the Bad Ischl Cemetery.

Ferris Building is a former federal building, which now houses classrooms and offices for the Kendall College of Art and Design, located at 17 Pearl St. NW in Grand Rapids, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. ==History== In 1906, Congress appropriated $500,000 to construct a new post office for Grand Rapids. In 1908, the supervising architect for the Treasury, James K. Taylor, created a design for the building, visiting Grand Rapids in April to determine a suitable material for the building's exterior. On February 12, 1909, Alice Roosevelt Longworth and her husband Nicholas Longworth III laid the building's cornerstone. The building was used by the U.S. Circuit Court until 1912, as well as the U.S. District Court and the post office. In the 1950s, Gerald R. Ford had his congressional offices in the building. In 1972, the post office and the court moved out into a new building. By 1981, the bottom levels of the building were converted to house the Grand Rapids Art Museum. That same year, the federal government turned the building over to the city of Grand Rapids. The art museum moved to a new building in 2007, and the former post office building sat vacant, although occasionally used for art shows. In 2010, Ferris State University leased the building from the city, and began redeveloping the building for use by the Kendall College of Art and Design. Redevelopment was completed in 2013, and the building was renamed after the founder of Ferris State, Woodbridge N. Ferris. ==Description== The Woodbridge N. Ferris Building building is a three-and-a-half story U-shaped Academic Classic building, constructed of structural steel with exterior masonry walls. The interior of the \\"U\\" is filled with a one-story portion of the building. It measures approximately 184 feet by 124 feet. The exterior is clad with stone, and the interior has concrete floors with mosaic surfaces, and interior partitions of plastered terra cotta. The roof originally had a slate surface, but is now covered with metal. The front facade is divided into three horizontal segments. The lower portion is the half-story basement, which is covered in large, smooth, stones and has small windows. The next segment contains the first story, a Renaissance Revival-style section containing large windows with arched heads and voussoired stones. The upper section of two floors contains half-round engaged columns along the front facade, modified into pilasters on the sides. Across the top is a classic cornice with small pediments at each end of the front facade. ==ReferencesGallery== File:Image Courtesy Kendall College of Art and Design of Ferris State University .jpg File:Photo Courtesy- Matt Gubancsik Kendall College of Art and Design of Ferris State University.jpg File:Kendall College of Art and Design sign.jpg Category:National Register of Historic Places in Kent County, Michigan Category:Government buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan ","title":"Woodbridge N.

In the song's first line, \\"Notre amour est chose l√©g√®re\\", the love celebrated by Armande Silvestre's merry lass was \\"light as air\\", \\"lifted by a gauze of finest weave in the hands of the sylphs\\". \\"Notre amour est chose charmante\\", the m√©lodie continued, and the charm of that love was equalled by the singer's and the song's. Next, \\"Notre amour est chose sacr√©e\\", and von Stade darkened her tone to portray the poet's enigmatic forest where there seemed to be a message in the stillness. Lastly, \\"Notre amour est chose √©ternelle\\", and von Stade's voice rose in uninhibited joy eloquent of the rapture of the lover's soul. Catulle Mend√®s Not every interpreter of the song had expressed its different feelings so successfully. Anne-Marie Rodde, with her \\"clear, young, very French tone\\", was a \\"delightful\\" performer of Faur√©, but although her \\"amour\\" was passionately happy, it did not seem to \\"care a centime whether it was 'l√©g√®re' or 'sacr√©e'.\\" Janet Baker, usually an imaginative artist, made the song into a prosaic utterance comparatively devoid of charm.Steane, J. B.: Gramophone, March 1983, p. 91 Faur√©'s melodies were ideal material for von Stade, \\"falling easily within the loveliest part of the voice, gaining warmth of expression from that deeper note of wistfulness often latent in the tone.\\" Her interpretations served Faur√©'s music with selfless fidelity. She did not subject his music to emphases that called unwelcome attention to themselves, but did inflect his seemingly simple melodic lines to acknowledge his songs' harmonies and the words of his poets. One was seldom conscious of artifice intruding into performances that mostly sounded instinctive. Jean-Philippe Collard was for the most part a good partner at the keyboard. At times, his piano was too prominent, and there were moments - such as in the opening bars of \\"Clair de lune\\" - when his left hand sounded unduly heavier than his right. But in \\"Mandoline\\", his incisive playing gave \\"a delicious spring to the rhythms of the serenade\\", and in \\"Apr√®s un r√™ve\\", his accompaniment supported von Stade's voice like the softest of pillows beneath the head of the song's awakening sleeper. Victor Hugo in 1876, photographed by √âtienne Carjat Taken as a whole, the album's one arguable defect was that it was slower paced than some listeners might prefer (although in \\"Dans les ruines d'une abbaye\\", von Stade's reading had a greater momentum than the classic version sung by Maggie Teyte). EMI's engineers had recorded both voice and piano beautifully and balanced them judiciously. \\"The recital\\", Steane concluded, \\"provides a delightful selection of Faur√©'s songs, including some of the best known and others very rarely met. It presents this lovely singer at her best, and a composer who gives increasing pleasure as the years go by: chose charmante.\\" George Jellinek reviewed the album on LP in Stereo Review in October 1983. All of Gabriel Faur√©'s songs seemed simple on the surface, he wrote, especially those dating from the composer's early years, but hidden inside them was a world of rhythmic and harmonic sophistication. They were diverse in character and feeling. Some, like \\"Le papillon et la fleur\\", were virtually domestic salon pieces. Most, like \\"Apr√®s un r√™ve\\" or \\"Clair de lune\\", were memorable for their sensuality. A few, like \\"Prison\\" or \\"Au cimeti√®re\\", were \\"startling with their muted passion or stark despair\\". Jean Richepin Frederica von Stade presented Faure's music with \\"a luscious tone that exploits the warmth of her mid-range and with a notable sensitivity to the poetic texts.\\" Von Stade's singing had always been enjoyable, but some of her records had been marred by effects that sounded contrived. On her new disc, she had become a better artist then ever before. Her interpretations were now \\"straightforward, unmannered and, when the mood calls for it, convincingly exultant.\\" Jean- Philippe Collard's accompaniments were \\"firm and muscular\\", which was in accord with what Faur√© would have wanted - he was a musician who preferred the clear light of classicism to the mists of transcendence. Sometimes, indeed, as in \\"Au bord de l'eau\\", he was probably sterner than was advisable, and von Stade was deprived of some of the freedom that she should have been permitted. EMI's audio quality was excellent. The album was \\"a beautiful record\\" that was not just a treat but a prize.Jellinek, George: Stereo Review, October 1983, p. 66 The album was also discussed in The Complete Penguin Stereo Record and Cassette Guide, which praised von Stade as \\"a deeply persuasive interpreter of French m√©lodies\\"Greenfield, Edward, Layton, Robert and March, Ivan: The Complete Penguin Stereo Record and Cassette Guide, Penguin, 1984, p. 410, and in Fanfare, where her recital was described as \\"uptight and overblown\\"Fanfare, Vol. 13, Issue 2, 1989, p. 205. ===Accolades=== Under the title Faur√©: Eighteen Songs, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for the best classical vocal solo performance of 1983.https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/frederica-von-stade-0 Stereo Review judged the album to be the best recordings of the month, and J.

Australian police conducted searches along with helicopters, drones, dogs, trackers, divers and rock climbers. Messaging platform Whatsapp cooperated with NSW Police in the endeavour to recover chat logs from the night. However, the information Whatsapp could provide was limited due to encryption.

He started playing in 1944 when the war was approaching its end when he joined one of Zagreb¬¥s major clubs, HA≈†K.Milan Kobe at enciklopedija.lzmk.hr, retrieved 18 July 2019 When the war was over, Yugoslavia changed from monarchy to become a communist regime. Most of the Serbian pro-monarchic clubs, just as Croatian pro-Ustashe ones, were disbanded, and the new authorities formed numerous new clubs to replace them. One of them was FK Na≈°a Krila Zemun, a club formed by the Yugoslav Air Force and based in Zemun where the bulk of the Yugoslav military aviation industry and its major bases were located. Solving this way the mandatory army conscription, Kobe moved from Zagreb to Zemun, located just in the outskirts of capital Belgrade. Surprisingly, The Aviators formed a strong diversified team, which feared no opposition and recognised no inferiority. Kobe joined in 1948, when the club had achieved promotion to the Yugoslav First League and, besides, reached the Yugoslav Cup final, all in their previous season which was their inaugural one. In his first season at Na≈°a Krila, Kobe and his companions finished 5th among 10 clubs forming the 1948‚Äì49 Yugoslav First League. However, even more impressive was that Na≈°a Krila reached a second Cup final in three years of existence, and, although this time Kobe was in the team, they ended again being the losing finalist, this time against Red Star Belgrade.Yugoslavia/Serbia (and Montenegro) - Cup History 1947-2006/07 at RSSSF, retrieved 18 July 2019 Na≈°a Krila, however, suffered the destiny of the Zemun's military aircraft industry, which the authorities decided to shot down and move to Mostar, in southern SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the factories were reopened as SOKO and begin production in 1950, the year Na≈°a krila played its last season before ceasing to exist. In 1950 the players of Na≈°a Krila are released, and Kobe returned to Zagreb and joined NK Zagreb, playing at national top-level as NK Borac Zagren back then. After two seasons, he moved to another local top-flight side, NK Lokomotiva, where he played until 1955. With a status of an already experienced player, he moved to Osijek, and joined an ambitious Yugoslav Second League side, NK Osijek, known back then as NK Proleter Osijek. His link with Osijek from then on grew strong, and after 3 seasons as player, when he retired he stayed in the club and became the coordinator of the Youth teams programme. He also had later episodes of being the main coach of lower-level local teams such as Sloga ƒêurƒëenovci and TIKO Osijek. He stayed in Osijek for the rest of his life, which ended in Osijek in 1966. ==References== Category:1926 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Zagreb Category:Yugoslav footballers Category:Croatian footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:HA≈†K players Category:FK Na≈°a Krila Zemun players Category:NK Zagreb players Category:NK Lokomotiva players Category:NK Osijek players Category:Yugoslav First League players Category:Yugoslav football managers Category:Croatian football managers ","title":"Milan Kobe"},{"id":"61308891","text":"Bachia peruana, the Peru bachia, is a species of lizard in the family Gymnophthalmidae.

It's in a privileged position, next to Braz Cubas and Mogi das Cruzes Universities, Mogi Shopping Mall, Estudantes Urban Bus Terminal, and Geraldo Scavone Bus Terminus, which are terminus for many bus lines. ==History== The creation of Braz Cubas University (1940) and Mogi das Cruzes University (1962) made an increase of students traffic from S√£o Paulo, Suzano, Ferraz de Vasconcelos, among other cities, flow to the city of Mogi das Cruzes. Until then, the commuter train lines had Mogi das Cruzes as terminus station, obligating the students to take a bus to do the percourse of remaining until these two campuses; With the demand growth, RFFSA created 2 special trains to attend to this demand: Alvorada and Estudantes. While the first was an express train with a different fee, the second attended exclusively the Mogi students demand. In one of these trips, on 8 June 1972, an electrical failure caused a collision between the students' train and a diesel express train. The accident caused the death of 23 people and wounded other 100. In the aftermath of the tragedy, Mogi residents claimed for an expansion of the commuter trains until the universities region. In the end of 1975, RFFSA hired Civilia Ircos Constructions and Commerce Ltd. company to construction a new station, by the cost of 4,500,000 BRB. Construction started on 20 February 1976 and there was a promise to deliver it on mid-August. However, delays made the station to open only on 10 November 1976. On the same day, TUE Budd Mafersa-Series 1400 were delivered to the traffic. In 1994, it was transferred to CPTM, which operated the station as an extension with scheduled departures at some hours of Variante Mogi Line, as the train needed to cross 4 level crossings in downtown Mogi, causing interruptions in the transit. In the mid-2000s, this operation was abolished and trains started to operate in full commercial time (4 a.m. to 12 a.m.). ==References== Category:CPTM stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1976 ","title":"Estudantes (CPTM)"},{"id":"61309054","text":"Relebactam is a chemical compound used in combination with antibiotics to improve their efficacy.

He joined the Macedonian Struggle very early on and as a prefect of the town, he was one of the key members of the National Committee of Baldzha. His mission was to inform the Defense Center of Thessaloniki about the movements of the Bulgarian armed groups and of the Ottoman military detachments. Several times he took armed action with the Milita of Baldzha in order to defend attacks by Bulgarian komitadjis. In November 1908, while the new regime of the Young Turks had launched persecution against the Greeks, he fled to the Defense Center of Thessaloniki and then fled to Athens, along with his partner Stavros Baretis, from Balaftsa (now Kolchiko), where he came in contact with the Macedonian Committee there. In 1912, Themistoklis Sofoulis contacted the Macedonian Committee of Athens to ask for help because the situation in Samos had become dangerous. The Ottoman- appointed Prince of Samos, Andreas Kopasis, had installed an Ottoman garrison on the island and the Greeks were being persecuted. The aims of the Macedonian Committee of Athens, as well as of Sofoulis and of the Greeks of Samos, concurred, as everyone was trying to liberate their homelands from the Ottomans. So, a collaboration was developed and Stavroudis met with Stavros Baretis and Themistoklis Sofoulis in order to organize the assassination of the ruler Andreas Kopasis. Stavroudis, pretending to be a tobacco trader, went to Samos in February 1912 with Stavros Baretis and there he prepared the murder plan with locals. A little bit before the plan occurred and Kopasis got murdered by Baretis, he returned by boat to Athens. Later, he participated in both Balkan Wars and distinguished himself in the Battle of Kilkis in 1913. During the First World War, he was assigned as a spy to the French Army to investigate issues related to Greek interests. He was honored with multiple medals for his contribution to the Macedonian Struggle and the Balkan Wars, while for his contribution to the Samos case a bust was erected in the town of Samos. == Sources & References == * Œü ŒúŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒ¥ŒøŒΩŒøŒºŒ¨œáŒøœÇ ŒëŒ∏Œ±ŒΩŒ¨œÉŒπŒøœÇ Œ£œÑŒ±œÖœÅŒøœçŒ¥Œ∑œÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∑ ŒµŒ∫œÑŒ≠ŒªŒµœÉŒ∑ œÑŒøœÖ ŒóŒ≥ŒµŒºœåŒΩŒ± ŒëŒΩŒ¥œÅŒ≠Œ± ŒöŒøœÄŒ¨œÉŒ∑, ŒöœâŒΩœÉœÑŒ±ŒΩœÑŒØŒΩŒøœÇ Œ§œÉŒ±œÅŒøœçœáŒ±œÇ * John S.

In 2019, it was approved for use in the United States for the treatment of complicated urinary tract and complicated intra-abdominal infections. It is administered via intravenous injection. The most common adverse reactions include nausea, diarrhea, headache, fever and increased liver enzymes. The most common adverse reactions observed in people treated for hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) include increased aspartate/alanine aminotransferases (increased liver enzymes), anemia, diarrhea, hypokalemia (low potassium) and hyponatremia (low sodium). == Medical uses== In the United States imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam is indicated for the treatment of people with complicated urinary tract infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections who have limited or no alternative treatment options. It is also indicated to treat hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) in adults 18 years of age and older. In the European Union it is indicated for the treatment of infections due to aerobic Gram-negative organisms in adults with limited treatment options. ==History== The application for imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam was granted Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP), fast track, and priority review designations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA granted the approval of Recarbrio to Merck & Co., Inc. The determination of efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam was supported in part by the findings of the efficacy and safety of imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI). The contribution of relebactam to imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam was assessed based on data from in vitro studies and animal models of infection. The safety of imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam, administered via injection, was studied in two trials (Trial 1/NCT01505634, Trial 2/NCT01506271), one each for cUTI and cIAI. The cUTI trial included 298 adult participants with 99 treated with the proposed dose of imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam. The cIAI trial included 347 participants with 117 treated with the proposed dose of imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam. Trial 1 enrolled adult participants hospitalized with cUTI. Trial 2 enrolled adult participants hospitalized with cIAI that required surgery or drainage. In both trials, participants were assigned to either imipenem/cilastatin with varying doses of relebactam or imipenem/cilastatin with placebo intravenously, every 6 hours for 4 to 14 days. Neither the participants nor the investigators knew which treatment was being given until after the trial was completed. The trials were conducted in Europe, South America, the United States, Asia Pacific, Africa, and Mexico. It was approved for use in the European Union in February 2020. In June 2020, imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam was approved for the indication to treat hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP) in adults 18 years of age and older. The safety and efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam for the treatment of HABP/VABP were evaluated in a randomized, controlled clinical trial of 535 hospitalized adults with HABP/VABP due to Gram-negative bacteria (a type of bacteria) in which 266 participants were treated with imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam and 269 participants were treated with piperacillin-tazobactam, another antibacterial drug.

The process of such a linkage is known as protein lipidation, and falls into the wider category of acylation and post- translational modification. Proteolipids are abundant in brain tissue, and are also present in many other animal and plant tissues. They are proteins covalenently bound to fatty acid chains, often granting them an interface for interacting with biological membranes. They are not to be confused with lipoproteins, a kind of spherical assembly made up of many molecules of lipids and some apolipoproteins. Depending on the type of fatty acid attached to the protein, a proteolipid can often contain myristoyl, palmitoyl, or prenyl groups. These groups each serve different functions and have different preferences as to which amino acid residue they attach to. The processes are respectively named myristoylation (usually at N-terminal Gly), palmitoylation (to cysteine), and prenylation (also to cysteine). Despite the seemingly specific names, N-myristoylation and S-palmitoylation can also involve some other fatty acids, most commonly in plants and viral proteolipids. The article on lipid-anchored proteins has more information on these canonical classes. There exist some rarer forms of protein acylation that may not have a membrane-related function. They include serine O-octanoylation in ghrelin, serine O-palmitoleoylation in Wnt proteins, and O-palmitoylation in histone H4 with LPCAT1. Hedgehog proteins are double-modified by (N-) palmitate and cholesterol. Some skin ceramides are proteolipids. The amino group on lysine can also be myristoylation via a poorly-understood mechanism. == In bacteria == All bacteria use proteolipids, sometimes confusingly referred to as bacterial lipoproteins, in their cell membrane. A common modification consists of N-acyl- and S‚Äëdiacylglycerol attached to an N-terminal cystine residue. Braun's lipoprotein, found in gram-negative bacteria, is a representative of this group. In addition, Mycobacterium O-mycolate proteins destined for the outer membrane. The plant chloroplast is capable of many of the same modifications that bacteria perform to proteolipids. One database for such N-Acyl Diacyl Glycerylated cell wall proteolipids is DOLOP. Pathogenic spirochetes, including B. burgdorferi and T. pallidum, use their proteolipid adhesins to stick to victim cells. These proteins are also potent antigens, and are in fact the main immunogens of these two species. Products of nonribosomal peptide synthase may also involve a peptide structure linked to lipids. These are usually referred to as \\"lipopeptides\\". ==See also== * Myelin proteolipid protein == References  External links == * * GO:0006497: gene ontology term for protein lipidation Category:Lipids Category:Proteins Category:Physiology ","title":"Proteolipid"},{"id":"61309162","text":"Osasco is a train station on CPTM Lines 8-Diamond and 9-Emerald, located in the city of Osasco. ==History== The station was built by Antonio Ag√π and opened on 20 August 1895 by Sorocaba Railway.

In 1960, a new building was built in the station, which became saturated in a short period of time. Meanwhile, the then-neighbourhood of Osasco fought and got its emancipation. In 1971, Fepasa dissolved Sorocaba Railway and, at the end of that decade, rebuilt most of the West Line stations. Osasco received a new station, opened on 25 January 1979.

Vancouver Sun, November 30, 1990. The film stars Stephen Fanning as Nick, a high school basketball player who is fired from his after-school job at a video store when his boss is informed of his HIV status. As the information spreads, some of Nick's friends immediately reject him because they incorrectly assume that he is gay; however, some of his other friends rally around him and start to work on an educational video about HIV and homophobia, inserting the film's educational component as they interview real people living with HIV about the disease.\\"A fast half-hour of stereotype-busting\\".

The Numidians were led by King Jugurtha, the Mauritanians were led by king Bocchus while the Romans were under the overall command of Gaius Marius who was supported by his quaestor Lucius Cornelius Sulla as cavalry commander. The Romans were victorious routing their opponents and capturing Cirta.Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, p. 33. ==Background== The war against King Jugurtha of Numidia had been going on since 112 BC. Several Romand commanders had tried to defeat the king and failed. In 107 BC, the new commander of the Roman forces in Africa, Gaius Marius captured the Numidian capital of Cirta, he then surprised Jugurtha by capturing the treasury fortresses at Thala. The following year Marius marched west again plundering the Numidian countryside. Marius's march west provoked the Mauretanian king, Jugurtha's father-in-law Bocchus, into joining forces with Jugurtha. At the end of the campaign, near a river called the Muluccha, Marius captured another of Jugurtha's treasury fortresses. After taking the fortress at the Muluccha Marius decided to return to Cirta to put his soldiers into winter quarters.Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, pp. 27‚Äì33; Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, p. 84. ==Prelude== While marching back east the Romans were ambushed, just to the west of Setif, by the combined forces of Jugurtha and Bocchus. Marius barely managed to keep his army from being destroyed; all he could do was form defensive circles and he then led his personal cavalry squadron to help each section that came under the most pressure. The Numidian and Mauretanian cavalries kept on attacking and for a time being Marius' main force found itself pinned down on a small hill, while Sulla and his men were on the defensive on another hill nearby.Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, pp 84‚Äì85; Lynda Telford, Sulla: A Dictator Reconsidered, p. 33; Sallust, Jugurtha, 97.3‚Äì4; Orosius, Against the Pagans, 5.15. The attackers, thinking they had the Romans well in hand, considered the matter completed for the day and retired to their camp. That night they celebrated their victory prematurely. The next morning at dawn the Romans launched a fierce attack on the Africans' camp taking them by surprise. The Numidians and Mauretanians were routed and Marius resumed his march on Cirta. When the Romans resumed the march to Cirta, they formed their army into a square to protect against further ambushes. Marius put his officers throughout the marching square to ensure discipline and orders were quickly related to his soldiers. Sulla, was given command of the entire right wing of the army.Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, p. 86. ==The Battle== As the Romans neared Cirta, Marius' scouts reported Jugurtha's army advancing on them in four divisions. Since Marius was unsure about Jugurtha's tactics he decided to halt his army and let the enemy come to him. Jugurtha ordered his men to attack the Romans and the battle began. Sulla's wing came under attack first, his men withstanding the assault. At this point in the battle the Mauritanian king Bocchus and his son Vollux appeared and attacked the Roman rear. Soon the Romans were under assault from every direction. The Romans were severely outnumbered, according to ancient sources the North Africans had marshalled 90,000 soldiers, almost giving them a three to one advantage.Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, p. 87; Orosius, Against the Pagans, 5.15. Jugurtha tried to dispirit the Romans, and called out to them that he had just killed Gaius Marius, and exposed his sword dripping with blood. For a short while the trick worked and the Romans were thrown into confusion, but Sulla, who had counter-attacked and driven off the enemy in his section of the battlefield, threw his forces against Bocchus. The Mauritanians broke under Sulla's assault and Bocchus fled the battlefield. Meanwhile, Marius had restored order to his troops and went on the offensive himself; he put a Jugurthine cavalry detachment to flight and moved on to the next weak spot in his line. Marius and Sulla focused their efforts on the weakest part of their lines and slowly but surely the tide of battle turned. The Romans gained the advantage and killed or routed the bulk of Jugurtha's army. The Numidian king and his remaining troops were surrounded and all were killed except Jugurtha who somehow was able to escape. The Romans had won the battle and slaughtered their enemy.Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, pp. 87‚Äì88; Sallust, Jugurtha, 101.11. ==Aftermath== The Romans resumed their march on Cirta and Marius put his men into winter quarters.Marc Hyden, Gaius Marius, p. 88. Jugurtha continued his war against Rome reverting to guerilla warfare. Unfortunately for Jugurtha, Marius and Sulla were able to convince king Bocchus it was in his best interest to abandon his son-in-law. Bocchus conspired with Sulla, who had traveled to Mauretania on a special mission to capture Jugurtha. It was a dangerous operation from the beginning, with King Bocchus weighing up the advantages of handing Jugurtha over to Sulla or Sulla over to Jugurtha. In the end, Bocchus decided his future lay with Rome and he helped capture Jugurtha.Plutarch, Life of Sulla, 3. Although Sulla had engineered the capture of Jugurtha, as Sulla was serving under Marius at the time, Marius took credit for this feat. The publicity attracted by this feat boosted Sulla's political career. ==References== Category:106 BC Category:100s BC conflicts Category:Battles involving the Roman Republic Category:Kingdom of Numidia ","title":"Second Battle of Cirta"},{"id":"61309247","text":"Bachia talpa, Ruthven's bachia, is a species of lizard in the family Gymnophthalmidae.

In 1832, his son William Edgar Howland and nephew William Henry Aspinwall became partners in Howland & Aspinwall. Aspinwall assumed the presidency in 1835 and expanded trade to South America, China, Europe, the Mediterranean, and the East and West Indies. Howland & Aspinwall owned some of the most famous clipper ships ever built. In 1845, while the firm owned the Ann McKim which was regarded as the fastest ship afloat, it built the Rainbow, which was even faster. The Rainbow was the high-tech racehorse of its day, and is considered to be the first of the extreme clippers. Instead of the bluff bow that was customary on ships up until that time, the Rainbow had a sharp bow, prompting on-lookers to joke that maybe she would sail better backwards. The next year, Howland & Aspinwall had the Sea Witch built, which set a speed record from China to New York which still stands.Somerville, Col. Duncan S., The Aspinwall Empire, p. 22, Mystic Seaport Museum, Inc., Mystic, CT, 1983. The firm and its profits made the Howlands and Aspinwalls very wealthy, In 1840s, Aspinwall's younger brother John Lloyd Aspinwall succeeded William Henry Aspinwall as president of Howland & Aspinwall. In 1848, Howland, along with William Henry Aspinwall and Henry Chauncey, founded the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, to provide service to California. This turned out to be a rather good year in which to start a steamship line to California, since the Gold Rush started the next year. Howland & Aspinwall were also the recipients of a federal government subsidy to operate their trans-oceanic steamship line, against which they were forced to compete with the unsubsidized line owned by Cornelius Vanderbilt. The company's first vessel to make the trip was packed with passengers. Pacific Mail eventually became American President Lines,Niven, John, The American President Lines and its Forebears 1948-1984, p. 15, University of Delaware Press, Newark, NJ, 1987. which is now part of Neptune Orient Lines.Elias, Rahita, Beyond Boundaries: The First 35 Years of the NOL Story, p. 8, Neptune Orient Lines Ltd., 2004. ==Personal life== Howland was twice married. His first marriage was to Louisa Edgar (1789‚Äì1826) on December 14, 1812. Louisa was the daughter of William Edgar. Together, they were the parents of five children, including: * William Edgar Howland (1813‚Äì1885), who married Ann Walter Cogswell. After her death, he married Hortense La Periene. * Annabella Edgar Howland (1816‚Äì1899), who married Rufus Leavitt (1794‚Äì1867). * Abby Woolsey Howland (1817‚Äì1851), who married Frederick Henry Wolcott Sr. in 1838. * Robert Shaw Howland (1820‚Äì1887), who founded Church of the Heavenly Rest in 1865 on New York's Upper East Side and was married to Mary Elizabeth Watts Woolsey, a sister of Eliza Newton Woolsey (the wife of his cousin Joseph Howland). * Marie Louisa Howland (b. 1823), who married James Brown (1823‚Äì1847). After the death of his first wife in 1826, he remarried to Louisa Sophia Meredith (1810‚Äì1888) on July 7, 1829. She was the daughter of Jonathan Meredith. They were the parents of: * Rebecca Brien Howland (1831‚Äì1876), who married her second cousin James Roosevelt Sr. in 1853. After Rebecca's death, James married Sara Ann Delano and became the father of Franklin D. Roosevelt. * Meredith Howland (1833‚Äì1912), who married Adelaide Torrance, the daughter of Daniel Torrance and Sophia Johnson (n√©e Vanderbilt) Torrance. * Gardiner Greene Howland Jr. (1834‚Äì1903), who married Mary Grafton Dulany in 1856 and was the general manager of the New York Herald. * Joanna Hone Howland (b. 1842), who married Irving Grinnel (b. 1840). * Emma Meredith Howland (1847‚Äì1849), who died in infancy. * Samuel Shaw Howland (1849‚Äì1925), who married Fredericka Belmont, daughter of August Belmont. Howland died on November 9, 1851 and was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. ===Descendants=== Through his daughter Rebecca, he was a grandfather of James Roosevelt Roosevelt (1854‚Äì1927), who married Helen Schermerhorn Astor, the second daughter of businessman William Backhouse Astor Jr. and socialite Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor. Through his son Gardiner Jr., he was a grandfather of Maud Howland (1866‚Äì1952), who married banker, financier, and philanthropist Percy Rivington Pyne II; and Dulany Howland (1859‚Äì1915), who married Marguerite McClure. After Dulany's death, Marguerite married Ambassador Ogden Haggerty Hammond, the father of Millicent Fenwick. ==See also== * Howland & Aspinwall == References  External links == * Category:1787 births Category:1851 deaths Category:American merchants Category:Burials at Green-Wood Cemetery ","title":"Gardiner Greene Howland"},{"id":"61309286","text":"Leptoptilos falconeri is an extinct species of large bodied Leptoptilini stork that existed during the Pliocene, having persisted until just over 2.58 million years ago. Although not the oldest fossil species of the genus Leptoptilos (as several date to earlier times such as the Miocene) it was the first fossil species of the genus to be described (found in cave deposits in India). Furthermore, it was the largest known species of stork ever and amongst the tallest and heaviest flying birds known to have existed, having reached at least in height.Louchart, A., Vignaud, P., Likius, A., Brunet, M., & White, T. D. (2005). A large extinct marabou stork in African Pliocene hominid sites, and a review of the fossil species of Leptoptilos. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, 50(3).Harrison, C. J. O. (1974). A re-examination of material of the extinct marabou stork, Leptoptilos falconeri: with descriptions of some new species. Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club, 94, 42-50. ==Taxonomy== The genus name Leptoptilos is derived from the Greek word meaning \\"thin or slender\\", which refers to the storks slim build and the Greek word meaning \\"down or soft feather\\", referring to the soft feather down covering the frame of the members of Leptotilos stork. The species name, falconeri was named in honor of Henri Falconer, who gathered the type specimen in the Sivalik Hills of India, to be later named by Alphonse Milne-Edwards in France. ==Distribution== Leptoptilos has an extensive fossil record, extending not only to Asia and Africa but to Europe and even to South America.Noriega, J. I., & Cladera, G. (2008). First record of an extinct marabou stork in the Neogene of South America. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, 53(4), 593-601. Leptoptilos falconeri, in particular, appears to have been a widely found species. Despite its type specimen being from India, extensive fossil records show it was distributed well into Africa, from deposits within Ethiopia, Chad and Egypt as well as possibly Kenya.Miller, E. R., Rasmussen, D. T., & Simons, E. L. (1997). Fossil storks (Ciconiidae) from the late Eocene and early Miocene of Egypt. Ostrich, 68(1), 23-26.Dyke, G. J., & Walker, C. A. (2008). New records of fossil ‚Äòwaterbirds‚Äô from the Miocene of Kenya. American Museum Novitates, 2008(3610), 1-10. Analysis by Louchart, et al. (2005) suggested that an excessive number of Leptoptilos had been described and that L. falconeri is the only species for which there is strong evidence of it being present in the Pliocene, making the lineage of extant Leptoptilos species somewhat ambiguous. Given its unique osteological characteristics, it is thought to be unlikely that L. falconeri is the ancestor of any living stork. ==Description and life history== Leptoptilos falconeri was similar in adaptations to a somewhat better-known cousin from a younger insular fossil species from Flores, Leptoptilos robustus, that also grew to very large dimensions, although current estimated sizes for that species are slightly smaller than L. falconeri. It can be inferred from the recorded dimensions of the bones that L. falconeri was substantially taller and heavier than other species of Leptoptilos. Much like L. robustus, L. falconeri showed reduced forelimb size relative to its otherwise oversized, robust skeletal structure, suggesting limited flying abilities (though, perhaps unlike L. robustus, it is not currently opined to have been completely flightlessness) and a strongly terrestrial lifestyle. The most striking feature of L. falconeri fossils are its very large size. It is estimated that this species attained an average height of and weighed approximately , larger than other good-sized fossil species such as Leptoptilos titan (and the aforementioned L. robustus). L. falconeri was taller than the tallest extant flying bird, the up to sarus crane, and substantially heavier than the heaviest flying birds such as condors, swans or large bustards. While the largest members of the bustard family can weigh up to perhaps or more, these largest living flying species average only around , about 45% less heavier on average than L. falconeri.Bridge, L. K., Stroud, D., Galbraith, C. A., & Boere, G. (2006). Waterbirds around the world. The Stationery Office.Pennycuick, C. J. (1996). Stress and strain in the flight muscles as constraints on the evolution of flying animals. Journal of biomechanics, 29(5), 577-581.Alonso, J. C., Maga√±a, M., Alonso, J. A., Palac√≠n, C., Mart√≠n, C. A., & Mart√≠n, B. (2009). The most extreme sexual size dimorphism among birds: allometry, selection, and early juvenile development in the great bustard (Otis tarda). The Auk, 126(3), 657-665. All three modern species of the genus Leptoptilos are large, bulky storks which forage extensive in open areas, switching between the lifestyle of being a scavenger on carrion, unlike other storks, and then alternating usually to more nutritious small, live prey such as fish and invertebrates when feeding nestlings (although the smaller lesser adjutant more infrequently engages in scavenging that the other two species).Hancock, J., Kushlan, J. A., & Kahl, M. P. (2010). Storks, ibises and spoonbills of the world. A&C; Black. Since the specifics of the life history of fossil storks are difficult to infer, it can be more or less assumed that fossil Leptoptilos led a similar lifestyle to the modern species. However, given the much larger sizes and limited flight of large species such as L. falconeri this may have facilitated a more cursorial foraging style and more active predation on sometimes substantial prey.Boaz, N. T. (1987). Neogene paleontology and geology of Sahabi. AR Liss. While modern species are not usually actively predatory, locally marabou storks are considered the most substantial threat to colonies of lesser flamingoes and have been shown to dispatch even adult flamingoes.Brown, L. H. (1971). The breeding behaviour of the lesser flamingo Phoeniconaias minor.

He was found guilty on both charges. On 4 October 2018, 6 politicians from the Danish People's Party made a proposal to outlaw the mosque, but the motion did not carry. In December 2018, Minister of Justice S√∏ren Pape Poulsen reported that the Ministry of Justice did not find a basis for this action in the constitution: On 21 June 2019, imam Mundhir Abdallah stated in a sermon that the rulers and heads of state of Muslim countries, such as Iran, UAE, and Saudi Arabia, were serving crusader countries (United States), and that Jerusalem was occupied by Zionists. ==References== Category:Mosques in Denmark Category:Islamism in Denmark Category:Hizb ut-Tahrir Category:Islam and antisemitism ","title":"Al-Faruq mosque"},{"id":"61309428","text":"Bronze statue of Chief Noonday on Grand Valley State University's campus in downtown Grand Rapids Noahquageshik (1755‚Äì1855 or 1770‚Äì1840), also spelled Nawehquageezhik, Nawehquageezhig, or Nowgeschick, and better known as Chief Noonday, was a chief of the Grand River Band of Ottawa Nation Native Americans in what would be become the U.S. state of Michigan. ==Biography== Noonday spent much of his life in Yankee Springs Township in western Michigan.

Tecumseh was killed in this battle, and Noonday inherited his tomahawk and hat. ==Legacy== The Chief Noonday Outdoor Center and Chief Noonday Recreational Heritage Route in that area are named after him. In 2010, sculptor Antonio Tobias Mendez completed a seven-foot-tall bronze statue of Noonday. The statue was placed near Grand Valley State University's Eberhard Center, along the Grand River in Grand Rapids.

Born in Burnham-on-Crouch, in Essex, Whiting moved with his parents to Southend-on-Sea when he was three years old. He left school at the age of twelve, working as a brickmaker in the summer, and as a general labourer in the winter. Six years later, he moved to Barking and found work at the Beckton Gas Works, where he joined the National Union of Gas Workers and General Labourers, working for the union as a full-time organiser from 1917. Inspired by Will Thorne, leader of the union, Whiting joined the Social Democratic Federation in his youth, and then its successor, the British Socialist Party (BSP). He first won election to Barking Urban District Council in 1909. One of the minority in the BSP who supported World War I, he joined the National Socialist Party (NSP) split in 1916, and served on its first provisional committee. He also served two terms as chair of the Urban District Council. The NSP adopted Whiting as its candidate in Romford at the 1918 UK general election. Although the NSP was affiliated to the Labour Party, Whiting failed to be selected as the Labour candidate, and he came last in a three-way race. For the 1922 UK general election, he was selected as the Labour Party candidate for Great Yarmouth, where he lost his deposit. The Gas Workers became part of the National Union of General and Municipal Workers, and Whiting remained an organiser for the union. Barking became a Municipal Borough in 1931, and Whiting served as Mayor of Barking in 1934/35. For the 1935 UK general election, his union sponsored him as a Labour Party candidate in Chorley. This was considered a winnable seat, but Whiting ultimately took second place, with 41.4% of the vote. Whiting died in 1938, while still serving on the council and working for the union. ==References== Category:1878 births Category:1938 deaths Category:British Socialist Party members Category:English trade unionists Category:Labour Party (UK) councillors Category:Labour Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:Mayors of places in Greater London Category:People from Burnham-on-Crouch ","title":"Arthur Whiting"},{"id":"61309507","text":"Mart van Duren (born 27 October 1964) is a retired Dutch football striker.Weltfussball ==References== Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Dutch footballers Category:PSV Eindhoven players Category:Racing Jet Wavre players Category:FC Den Bosch players Category:FC Groningen players Category:FC Basel players Category:Association football forwards Category:Eredivisie players Category:Swiss Super League players Category:Dutch expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Belgium Category:Dutch expatriate sportspeople in Belgium Category:Expatriate footballers in Switzerland Category:Dutch expatriate sportspeople in Switzerland Category:PSV Eindhoven non-playing staff ","title":"Mart van Duren"},{"id":"61309511","text":"Hella Heyman (also credited as Hella Hamon) is a cinematographer and actress, known for At Land (1944), Ritual in Transfigured Time (1946) and Invocation: Maya Deren (1987). ==Life== Heyman, married to director and cinematographer Alexander Hammid his divorced in 1948 with Maya Deren.

Redston's assailant was never caught, and it remains an infamous cold case in Canberra to this day. ==Disappearance== On 27 September 1966, Redston was sent by his mother to buy ice cream for himself and his brother from the local shops. Redston however sent his brother away and headed to his friend's house, planning to spend the day at the Curtin Tip. After waiting for a short period of time, Redston left the area and was not seen again until his body was discovered the next day.

Both men were seen with Redston earlier that day, and both were seen leaving the tip where Redston is believed to have been murdered. Two boys also came forward to report incidents earlier that year where two men with the same description had bound and attempted to murder them in similar ways. The first was tied up and thrown in a lake, however he managed to free himself and swim to safety. The second was bound up similarly, but escaped with help from their friends.

Bo'ness is a site of significance to the cause of Scottish Nationalism due to a strong history of various nationalist groups like the Bo'ness Rebels Literary Society, active branches of the Young Scots National League, (a predecessor to today's Young Scots for Independence) its own local Scottish Covenant committee, as well as the foreshore in Bo'ness being the home of an independent nationalist candidates at parliamentary elections as early as the 1950 General Election, decades before the SNP itself stood candidates in every constituency in Scotland. == Founding == The first mention of the Bo'ness Branch SNP can be found in the Bo'ness Journal from Friday 22 November 1946. In the correspondence columns, a letter from a Mr Chas J. Auld of Dean Road, then the Secretary of Bo‚Äôness SNP welcomes \\"the winter session\\" on behalf of the Scottish National Party, and states that during this time, \\"besides the weekly committee meetings, we intend on running a new year dance and burns supper\\". This would come to be the first event of the Bo'ness Rebels Literary Society, just over a year later. The SNP won their first election in Bo'ness on May 3, 1949. William Horn, then 'Branch Chairman' of the Bo'ness Branch was elected for Bo'ness South Ward. The SNP did not stand candidates in any other wards, and Horn's election agent, Charles Auld is the same person who wrote the letter to the journal mentioned above. This suggests the 'Bo'ness Branch SNP' would have been a small organisation, which is of significance when considering the history of the 'branch founding' which follows. This is comparatively early for electoral success in the history of Scottish Nationalism, but when considering that at this time the Bo'ness Rebels ceilidhs would have been occurring regularly, and there had been a debate on Scottish Independence in Bo'ness Town Hall on 29 March of the same year, this adds a distinctly local dimension to the general post war discontent of British government amongst some Scots reflected in various events around this time, namely the election of the first SNP MP Dr. Robert Macintyre in 1945, the home rule protests against British PM Clement Attlee during his visit to the Cowal Highland Gathering in Dunoon in 1950, and the returning of the stone of scone. However, the Scots independent newspaper possesses a list of the dates of the founding of SNP branches based on their own archives, which states that the Bo'ness Branch was founded much later in February 1963 - which is at odds from the evidence of the Bo'ness journal from 1946. The reason for this is not particularly clear - it is possible that the 'Bo'ness Branch SNP' of the 1940s was not formally affiliated with the SNP as a party, or perhaps became an organisation whose purpose in the 1950s became solely to field candidates at election time, while its members were more focussed on the Rebels Society or the Covenant groups etc. in Bo'ness which were focussed on 'home rule' of some kind. In the late 1950s, however, a meeting was held at the Douglas Hotel in Bo'ness, now demolished, where the town clock is today. This was organised and attended by a few nationalists in the town and surrounding areas, including William Kellock, then secretary of the Bo'ness Rebels Literary Society, Jack Marshall who would later be Billy Wolfe's election agent in the 1962 West Lothian by-election - the constituency of which Bo'ness was then a part - and Angus McGillveray of Whitburn who would later run the SNPs publication department. This meeting was to be the beginning of a 'West Lothian' branch of The SNP, which over time attracted so many members that they subsequently dissolved into various smaller branches for each individual town, as is the case for SNP branches today. This fits in with the Scots independents notification that the Bo'ness Branch as it is today was founded in February 1963, so factually this is the founding date of the Bo'ness Branch. ==References== Category:Bo'ness Category:Scottish National Party ","title":"Bo'ness Branch SNP"},{"id":"61309845","text":"Cefoperazone/sulbactam is a combination drug used as an antibiotic.

Srpski Dnevnik (Serbian Daily), Danica (Morningstar) and Napredak (Progress) established its reputation and founded a tradition of independent journalism. He is credited for being the first Serbian to translate the works of Miguel de Cervantes. The son of a jurist, Djordje Popoviƒá was educated at Belgrade Lyceum (precursor to Grandes √©coles). Upon graduation, abandoning the idea of being called to the bar, he began writing on literature, theatre, and politics in Srpski dnevnik (Serbian Daily), to which he contributed literary portraits under the pseudonym \\"Daniƒçar,\\" after the name of the paper he founded. The turning point in Djordje Popoviƒá-Daniƒçar's career came on 10 March 1860 when he first started to publish Danica (Morning Star) in Novi Sad, then part of Hungary. The first issue of \\"Danica\\" came out on 20 February 1860, and the last 20 August 1872. Issues of the magazine were coming out every ten days, with an interruption from August 1871 to May 1872. ƒêorƒëe Popoviƒá initiated and edited this magazine from the first issue until August 1871. Digitalne kopije stranica svih brojeva ƒçasopisa Danica, The third paper of those times was \\"Napredak\\" (Progress, 1863-1869) supported by the pen and intellectual strength of Djordje Popoviƒá- Daniƒçar and his colleagues, Danilo Medakoviƒá, Mihailo Polit-Desanƒçiƒá and Jovan Jovanoviƒá Zmaj. The conception of the paper was not a firm one, it often vacillated and shared the fate of the differing views of its editors, who edited the paper and its trend. Daniƒçar's influence on the Serbian language at the time, while it was undergoing reforms, has been significant enough to warrant a study a century later. It wasn't until forty years later that Daniƒçar's work was completed and published. In 1864, eight chapters from Part I of Miguel de Cervantes's \\"Don Quixote\\" were rendered into Serbian. (Miguel de Cervantes who wrote \\"Don Quixote\\", a classic of Western literature, is sometimes considered both the first modern novel.) A contemporary of events, Djordje Popoviƒá-Daniƒçar once described the spirit prevailing in Serbia in one of the newspapers he was writing: \\"When it was learned in Belgrade how Serbia had fared at the Treaty of San Stefano (1878) everyone was dismayed....\\" He was a corresponding member of the Society of Serbian Letters, elected on 21 January 1862. Also, a member of the Serbian Learned Society, appointed on the date of its foundation 29 May 1864. He was elected full member on January 30, 1885, at the Committee for Philosophical and Philological Sciences. He became a member of the Serbian Royal Academy on 15 November 1892.

Rozon, Ren√©. Michael Blackwood and the Filmed Chronicle of Modern Art. Le Journal Ateliers, 1981. ==Early years== Blackwood was born in Breslau, Germany on July 15, 1934. In 1949, the family relocated to New York City. Kleihues, Josef Paul and Rathgeber, Christian. ‚ÄúBerlin and New York: A Personal Involvement: Michael Blackwood.‚Äù Berlin-New York: Like and Unlike, Essays on Architecture and Art from 1870 to the present, Rizzoli International Publications, 1993. ==Career== Blackwood‚Äôs first film experience came at the NBC Special Films Unit where he worked under the editor Isaac Kleinerman to make documentary films such as Broadway Express (1957-1959). Blackwood's fly on the wall approach in this early short film marked the starting point of the observational filmmaking style he would become known for. Later he worked as a freelance producer-director for German Television to make documentary films about cultural news subjects, which would result in ongoing collaborations with them during his independent film career. With the help of his brother Christian, Michael created Blackwood Productions in 1966, a production company dedicated to making films about art, music, and the cultural landscape in New York City. Blackwood's main aim was to document the New York art scene unfolding around him in the 1960s and 1970s. Starting with his documentation of Christo's Wrapped Coast project in Little Bay, Australia in 1969, Blackwood began a series of monographic films with artists such as David Hockney, Robert Motherwell, Philip Guston, Isamu Noguchi, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal, Jim Dine, Jasper Johns, and Robert Rauschenberg. He also directed film surveys with dozens of participants, covering subjects such as the New York School of painting, abstract expressionism, pop art, American art in the 1960s and 70s, postmodern choreography, modern sculpture and postmodern architecture. Blackwood's first film on the subject of New York City was his silent short film titled Broadway Express (1959), an intimate, action-filled portrait of the city's subway system, highlighting its diverse ridership. Staying true to his observational filmmaking style, Blackwood hit the streets and made Summer in the City (1969), a film documenting the culture of the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The film, conceived by Christian Blackwood and narrated by Uwe Johnson, followed a block party organized by the Peace and Freedom Party, protestors outside City Hall, old age home residents, two heroine addicts, drag pageant contestants, and many others, making it a diverse display of New York City life. In 1985, Michael completed his feature documentation of New York City, the monstrous Empire City (1985), a look at the political, economic, and social state of Manhattan with appearances from David Rockefeller, Norman Mailer, Ed Koch, Phillip Johnson, Keith Haring, Jane Jacobs, Joseph Papp, Donald Trump, Brooke Astor, and Herman Badillo, among others. The film took an honest look at the economic disparities between the rich and the poor, political struggles, and the ever-present art scene that defined New York City in the 1980s. The Blackwoods might be most well known for their two monographic cinema verit√© films Monk (1968) and Monk in Europe (1968), documenting legendary jazz pianist Thelonious Monk. Some of this footage was featured in the Charlotte Zwerin documentary Thelonious Monk: Straight, No Chaser (1988), which was executive produced by Clint Eastwood. The original footage of Monk, which followed him in New York, Atlanta, and on tour in Europe, is some of the only existing footage of the musician in action. The two brothers worked side by side until 1982 when Christian decided to go his own way and produce his own films. Michael renamed Blackwood Productions to Michael Blackwood Productions in 1982, and occasionally collaborated with Christian on films even after Christian‚Äôs departure. With his new production company also based in New York, Christian Blackwood made a dozen films during a ten year period before his death in 1992.Christian Blackwood, Film Maker, Dies at 50. New York Times, July 25, 1992 Michael Blackwood Productions expanded to encompass the subject of architecture with the film Beyond Utopia: Changing Attitudes in American Architecture (1983) and went on to document the works of many other architects including Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Arata Isozaki, and Richard Meier. Michael Blackwood directed and produced over 50 films between 1983 and 1999 under Michael Blackwood Productions, and since 2000, an even greater number, largely split between the subjects of Art and Architecture. ==Legacy== Michael Blackwood created over 150 films covering art, architecture, dance, music, history, and culture with such figures as Thelonious Monk, Philip Guston, Zaha Hadid, Francis Bacon, Philip Glass, Laurie Anderson, and Andy Warhol. Blackwood helped define a cinema verit√© observational style of filmmaking that was practiced by such contemporaries as Albert Maysles and D.A. Pennebaker. His diverse array of films and subjects contain a common thread of didacticism and austerity, favoring pure reporting over the art of filmmaking. Blackwood's core belief is that in the cinema lies the power to enlighten the viewer, and thus reconcile the masses with the art of the postwar world. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Michael Blackwood Productions Website * *Michael Blackwood Productions Awards and Honors Category:American documentary film producers Category:Film people from Wroc≈Çaw Category:Filmmakers from New York (state) Category:1934 births Category:Living people Category:Polish emigrants to the United States ","title":"Michael Blackwood (filmmaker)"},{"id":"61310292","text":"Cameron \\"Cammy\\" Palmer (born 15 May 2000) is a Northern Irish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for USL Championship side Orange County SC on loan from Rangers. ==Club careerEarly career=== Palmer was born in York and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He is the son of Don Palmer, a church pastor, author and speaker, currently based in Glasgow, but originally from Belfast. Cammy (Cameron) moved with his family to Canada when he was only 8 months old. He started playing competitive soccer at age 5, playing for Pickering, Ajax and eventually Whitby Iroquois Soccer clubs. Whilst playing for Whitby in Ontario, former Rangers player Andy Kennedy came across the young footballer. Kennedy contacted Rangers and told them about the youngster. His family moved back to Scotland in 2011 and Palmer went on trial and very soon joined the youth ranks of the Glasgow giants. After impressing at numerous levels at the club, Palmer was named as the reserve side‚Äôs team captain in 2018. ===Professional career=== After a solid progression at youth level for Rangers, Palmer signed a contract extension with the Ibrox side until 2021 in June 2019. On 10 July 2019, Palmer joined Scottish Championship side Partick Thistle on loan until January 2020. Three days later Palmer made his professional footballing debut in a 1-0 win in the Scottish League Cup against Airdrieonians at Firhill. Palmer scored his first professional goal scoring for Thistle in a 3-1 away win over Inverness.https://ptfc.co.uk/ptfc- fixture/inverness-caledonian-thistle-v-partick-thistle-28th-september-2019/ On 3 February 2020, Palmer joined USL Championship club Orange County SC on loan for the 2020 season. ===International=== An exciting prospect, Palmer qualifies to play for England, Scotland (through his mother‚Äôs side) and Northern Ireland (through his father‚Äôs side).

The group debuted on May 28, 2019, with Dot Point Jump. == History  2016-2018: Pre-debut references and activities === In December 2016, Blockberry Creative announced the debut of a new group called \\"8x8x8\\", which would follow up from the ongoing debut project of girl group LOONA. This name originated from the fact that they would debut on August 8, 2018. Along with this, Blockberry Creative also announced they would begin holding auditions from January 2017 to determine the lineup of this group. The next year, in April 2017, the first of these trainees was revealed, with the appearance of leader Love in the music video for ViVi of LOONA's solo album. Later, in September 2017, 8x8x8 was once again mentioned briefly in the description of LOONA ODD EYE CIRCLE's music video for 'Girl Front', stating that the B-Side \\"Chaotic\\" on their mini-album \\"Mix & Match\\" had 'initially been chosen to be the title track for 8x8x8. However, as no further mention was made of the group after this point, with LOONA releasing their lead single for their debut album on August 7, 2018, it led many to believe that 8x8x8 had either been delayed or shelved, in order for BlockBerryCreative to prioritize their main group. ===2019: Debut with Dot Point Jump and First Comeback Line Sun Goodness=== On April 30, 2019, however, Jaden Jeong (OnlyOneOf's creative director) posted the logo of OnlyOneOf to his Instagram, announcing that the group would 'finally debut in May'. It has therefore been speculated that, after the departure of Jaden Jeong from Blockberry Creative, the trainees who had been selected for the lineup of \\"8x8x8\\" were transferred to RSVP. With the release of the first group image a day later, as well as the music video teaser for \\"Savanna\\", familiar faces were soon spotted among the members. One of these was Love, who, as previously mentioned, had appeared in LOONA member ViVi's debut music video \\"Everyday I Love You\\", as well as starring as one of the male leads in the webdrama \\"Woomanna\\". It was revealed on May 24, 2019, that the group would debut with two title tracks: fan title \\"Savanna\\" and pop title \\"time leap\\", as part of a mini album titled \\"Dot Point Jump\\". Four days later, on May 28, 2019, the music videos for both title tracks \\"Savanna\\" and \\"time leap\\" were released, with each of the other tracks being unveiled individually once the hashtag '#OnlyOneOf' had been used 5,555 times on Twitter. These milestones were reached over the following days, with the full mini album being available for purchase as of June 13, 2019. On October 4, 2019, the first teaser for their second mini album \\"Line Sun Goodness\\" was uploaded to YouTube, announcing that their first comeback would take place in the same month. A week later, the individual teaser photo for YooJung was released, revealing the album would be released on October 30, 2019. OnlyOneOf made their first comeback with the title track \\"Sage\\". Due to technical difficulties, the music video was not released until 3 days later, on November 2, 2019. ===2020: Unknown art pop 2.1, Yours only 2.2, Produced by [ ] series=== On January 23, 2020, the first teaser for unknown art pop 2.1 was released, and \\"dOra maar\\" was released a week later.

He graduated from Denver (Colorado) High School in June 1902, and entered the University of Wyoming where he majored in science and the classics. He received his BA from Wyoming in 1905. In 1904 he was chosen to be a member of the first group of Rhodes Scholars. He attended Lincoln College, Oxford University, where he was enrolled in the honors school in English language and literature. He was awarded a BA from Oxford in 1907 and an MA in 1912. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. ==Career== Merriam taught at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, from 1908 to 1910. In the fall of 1910, he enrolled at Harvard University as an Austin Fellow. Merriam left Harvard, where he studied drama, after the fall term to teach a Beloit College in Wisconsin, where he remained until 1913. He then taught at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, until 1919. During World War I, Merriam took a leave of absence from his teaching career and went with YMCA to France, where he taught English to French officers. After the Armistice he was transferred to London, where he assisted American officers and enlisted men in entering British universities. The University of Montana hired him in 1919 to teach English and to chair the English department. Merriam introduced creative writing into the curriculum. To encourage his students to write, he began editing their works and publishing them in a new magazine, The Frontier. This later merged with the Midland, published in Iowa City, IA, to form Frontier and Midland. This well-respected regional literary magazine encouraged students and writers not only from Montana, but from throughout the Pacific Northwest. The publication featured the early efforts of regional writers A.B. Guthrie, Dorothy M. Johnson, Helen Addison Howard, Grace Stone Coates, and others. Publication of the journal continued until 1939. Merriam began a series of writer's conferences in Montana in the summer of 1930. These short conferences offered creative writers the opportunity to work with such nationally known writers as Struthers Burt, Mary Austin, Frank Ernest Hill, and others. The conferences continued through the summer of 1934, were suspended until 1948 and continued through the summer of 1960. Following the formation of the Montana Academy of Sciences in 1940, Merriam formulated the idea for the Montana Institute of the Arts, which was founded in 1948. He served as its first president and in 1957 became the editor of the Montana Institute of the Arts Quarterly, a position he filled until 1964. From 1907 to 1919, the University of Montana had no Rhodes Scholars. Merriam became very active in the program; with his encouragement, sixteen University of Montana students went to Oxford between 1919 and 1970. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the program and served many years on its regional and local committees. In 1933, in addition to his duties as chairman of the English department, Merriam was appointed chairman of the Division of Humanities, a new concept in University administration. He continued carrying the two assignments until his retirement in 1954. In December 1935, Merriam was appointed state supervisor of the Federal Writers' Project. His efforts culminated in the publication of Montana, A State Guide Book in 1939. He also took leave from the University of Montana in 1939 to teach at the University of Oregon in Eugene, and earned his Ph.D. in English from Columbia University. ==Legacy== Merriam was instrumental in the recognition of the importance and accomplishments of American and Northwest writers. Prior to his work and that of others, literary studies in the United States were largely confined to British authors; an individual with a college degree in English would usually have studied no American authors. In recognition of his accomplishments, the University of Wyoming awarded him an LL.D. in 1962, citing his record as \\"Rhodes Scholar, professor of literature, founder and editor of magazines for new writers in the Northwest, anthropologist of regional writing, pioneer in the discovery of the cultural potentialities of his region.\\" In 1963, an honorary LL.D. followed from the University of Montana Missoula. In 1978, he was honored at the 75th dinner celebration of the Rhodes Scholars in New York.The University of Montana Creative Writing Program gives out the annual Merriam-Frontier Award to the best submitted piece of writing in the fields of poetry, fiction, or creative nonfiction in his honor. ==Personal life== H.G. Merriam married Doris W. Foote in 1915 and they had two children: Alan and Alison. Doris Merriam died in 1970. Four years after the death of his wife, he married Frances Dummer Logan in 1974. H. G. Merriam died in Missoula, Montana, on March 26, 1980 at the age of 96. ==ReferencesExternal Links== *H.G.

Constructed in four weeks. It arrived and was installed in 12 hours by 300 workers. One ring of the lower level served as a pit for the 60-member Los Angeles Olympic Symphony Orchestra. The three other rings were filled with water 6 inches deep. The ceremony was directed by David Wolper and Tommy Walker. They also hired producer Daniel Flannery and his production company. Flannery was the conceptualist working directly with David Wolper and Tommy Walker. Once the ceremonies were conceived the LAOOC contracted Flannery to produce and his firm to supervise the special effects and special lighting of the Ceremony. This included designing the famous spaceship and alien. Flashlights were given to all 92,000 attendees. Three colors were interchangeable, red white and blue. Coliseum announcer was Charles Corsen. During a pre-recorded interview during the ABC broadcast, IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch, declared to Peter Jennings the games were a \\"10\\" out of 1-10. The Marathon began at 5:00 PM, before the start of the ceremony. The finish line was the Coliseum. A couple runners staggered in with cheers from the crowd. Marathon winners were awarded their medals with Portugal's Carlos Lopes being awarded the gold. His national anthem was played. Traditionally, the final equestrian event was also held at the Olympic Stadiums in past games, the day of the closing ceremony. Los Angeles held the event the day before, elsewhere. It was changed as to not damage the coliseum field or stage prep. Instead the three medal winners rode in on horseback, paraded to the medal podium during the pre ceremony. After the US anthem was played for gold medal winner Joseph Fargis, they took a victory lap again on horseback around the coliseum with cheers from the crowd. ==Ceremony== As in the opening ceremony, city church bells rang to commence the start of the ceremony. === Parade of Nations === In previous Olympic Games, only six athletes from each countries delegation were allowed to attend the closing ceremony. The LAOOC allowed all athletes wishing to attend. This was the first time allowed in a closing ceremony. Over 6000 athletes marched into the stadium. Los Angeles Olympic fanfare was played from the Coliseum peristyle by the 750 member \\"Olympic All American Marching Band\\". They played the 1984 Olympic theme song; John Williams' composed \\"Olympic Fanfare and Theme\\". Other songs were played while the flag bearers, country name placards and then the athletes of 140 nations marched in masse. ===Anthems and Gift Exchanges=== The National anthems of Greece by tradition, the United States the host nation, and then South Korea, the next host city were played. On center stage, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley was joined by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and the Mayor of Seoul Yom Po-Hyun, South Korea for the Antwerp flag transfer. Passed from Tom Bradley to Juan Antonia Samaranch to Mayor Yom-Po-Hyun. American children of different races gifted Korean children Silver Olympic coins and in exchange the Korean children gifted the American children traditional Korean Jewelry boxes. Ode to Joy was played by the symphony. ===Seoul performance=== Seoul, the host city of the 1988 Summer Olympic Games performed a traditional Buchaechum. The dance was performed by the Seoul City Dance Theater. The dance troupe was joined by Hodori the Asian tiger, the 1988 mascot. The Dance Theater of Harlem then performed the Stars and Stripes ballet by George Balanchine to reciprocate. ===Speeches and the Games declared closed=== LAOOG President Peter Ueberroth deliver a speech. IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch deliver a speech in English, awards the Olympic Order in Gold to Ueberroth. IOC President then declared closed the Games of the XXIII Olympiad in Los Angeles, and accordance with tradition, and call upon the youth of the world to assemble four years from now in Seoul, to celebrate the Games of the XXIV Olympiad. The Olympic flag was lowered by Los Angeles citizens chosen; while the Olympic Hymn played and was sung by the symphony. Four loud firework booms sounded. Military trumpeters appeared above the cauldron. Actor Richard Basehart, read from the Greek lyric poet Pindar's Ode to Olympians. As Basehart read the last refrain, the Olympic flame was then extinguished. ===Entertainment=== During the start of the entertainment section, the Coliseum announcers informed the audience to set their flashlights to blue and turn them on at the count of three. As the blue lights came on, the Symphony played the Introduction (Einleitung) of Thus Spoke Zarathustra by Richard Strauss. A \\"flying UFO\\" appeared above the stadium. The stage lit up and \\"spoke\\" to the spaceship with lights in dueling form, using the Los Angeles Olympic Theme notes. Similar to the film ending of Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The Coliseum arches glowed and the peristyle lit up from behind and simulated the space ship landing. A laser show within the coliseum commenced. At the end, a 7ft tall single \\"alien\\", appeared above the parapet of the cauldron and announced the city and humanity kept \\"the ideals of the Olympics\\" and declared \\"I salute you\\". ===Fireworks Show=== Fireworks show was a salute to each Olympic city. Each city was announced to the audience, with its Olympics sequence announced with a quick anecdote. Each cities national folk music was played by the Symphony to accompany the display. Examples of music: :Paris, the Can-Can. :Berlin, Ride of the Valkyries :London, The River Kwai March. :Melbourne, Waltzing Matilda. :Los Angeles, The Stars and Stripes Forever. ===Concert section=== Lionel Richie performed an extended version of, \\"All Night Long\\" along with American dance style of breakdancing. Confetti rained with large scale balloons. Athletes remained on the field and danced as American pop music played. A large display of fireworks followed and ended the show along with \\"Auld Lang Syne\\".

He discovered the vectors for relapsing fever and kala-azar. He had important administrative responsibilities in Iraq during the First World War and emerged as a leading figure in Indian medical science, public health, and tropical hygiene between the wars as director of the Haffkine Institute in Bombay (Mumbai). ==Personal life and career== Born on February 19, 1875 to Annis, n√©e Bennett, and John Mackie, rector of Filton, Gloucestershire, England, Frederick Percival (‚ÄúPer‚Äù) was the second of their four surviving children. At the time of his marriage to Annis, John already had seven children by a previous marriage, and it fell to Annis to become, with the addition of her own four, mother or stepmother to eleven children. She was a devoted parent, kept closely in touch with them, and chronicled their doings almost until the time of her death in 1927. Her family chronicles provided much of the material included in a memoir by one of her grandchildren, which contains a more detailed account of Percival Mackie's early years, his boyhood adventures and schooling, his academic successes, the women he married, his character, and career highlights as seen from her maternal perspective. ===Medical training=== Mackie showed an early interest in anatomy. Family legend has it that when the family dog died, he boiled it up in a huge cauldron on the vicarage lawn until the bones came loose so that he could take them out and dry them and reassemble the dog as a skeleton. He received his early education at Dean Close School, Cheltenham, and his basic medical training at the University of Bristol Medical School and St Bartholomew's Hospital. London. His exceptional ability was quickly recognized. As Saunders scholar (1897) and silver medallist at Bristol General Hospital, he completed his final exams in 1898 and was immediately appointed to a position as Casualty Officer and House Physician. During this time, in December 1898, he published his first of some 85 scientific papers, ‚ÄúNotes on a Case of Blackwater Fever‚Äù in The Lancet. A year later he was Junior Medical Officer at County Medical Asylum in Shrewsbury, and then spent 18 months as Superintendent at the Bristol City Isolation Hospital at Ham Green. He entered the Indian Medical Service (I.M.S.), passing out in first place in 1902, aged 27, with a gold medal in medicine. Later in his career he added the F.R.C.P and the F.R.C.S as well as the D.P.H to his professional qualifications. ===1903‚Äì1914 research on tropical diseases=== Soon after his arrival in India in 1903, Mackie joined the Younghusband expedition to Tibet as medical officer, with the military rank of Lieutenant, attached to the 38th Central India Horse Regiment. On his return, he became assistant director of the Plague Research Laboratory in Bombay (Mumbai) and began working on plague, a topic to which he returned some 20 years later. In 1905, W.B. Bannerman, the director of the laboratory, wrote that, ‚ÄúCapt. Mackie has served under me for the past 6 months. He has good intelligence, ability and self-reliance and is very pleasant to work with. His professional efficiency is of a high order and he is tactful in his dealings with his subordinates. He is zealous and diligent in the discharge of his professional duties and his conduct is excellent.‚ÄùDirector of the Plague Research Laboratory, Bombay (later the Haffkine Institute), ‚ÄúConfidential reports on Indian Medical Service Officers for 1905,‚Äù L/MIL/7/482, India Office Records (IRO) now at the British Library. Throughout his life, so far as his administrative duties permitted, Mackie devoted himself to the study of plague and other tropical disease. As he later put it in his Presidential address to the Medical Research Section of the Indian Science Congress ‚ÄúFor nearly twenty years my principal interest has been in the relationship of insects to the transmission of disease, having devoted successive periods of time to fleas and plague, bugs and lice and relapsing fever, mosquitoes and malaria, tse-tse flies and sleeping sickness, and to the insect side of the kala-azar problem.‚ÄùMackie, F. P. \\"The insect menace,\\" Ind. Med. Gaz. 1925 Apr; 60(4):172-179. ===Relapsing fever=== While at the Plague Research Laboratory he made what was probably his chief contribution to medicine, the discovery that the body louse, a blood-sucking insect, might serve as a vector for the transmission of relapsing fever. In August 1907 Mackie was sent to investigate an outbreak of relapsing fever that had broken out at a mission settlement in Nasik (now Nashik), in the state of Maharashtra. The boys and girls residing at the settlement were housed in separate, similar bungalows but many more of the boys than the girls were taken ill with the disease and Mackie's investigation pointed to the cause. The boys were found to be infested with body lice, while the girls were almost free of them. Confirmation of the body louse as vector came from microscopic examination of the lice, which showed they were carrying large numbers of the spirochetes characterizing the human disease and that they were multiplying within the insects‚Äô stomachs. It was subsequently found that transmission occurs when the louse is crushed against the victim's skin.F.

Bateman, A. E. Hamerton. Photo courtesy of Peter and Joanna Mackie A pressing issue at the time was the possibility of African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis) spreading to India via similar blood- sucking insect vectors. In September 1908, at the request of the Indian Government, Captain Mackie was attached to the Royal Society‚Äôs Sleeping Sickness Commission headed by Sir David Bruce F.R.S. Based at Mpumo, Uganda. Mackie was one of Bruce's youthful ‚ÄúThree Musketeers,‚Äù the others being Captains H.R. Bateman and Albert Ernest Hamerton. The accompanying photo shows (L to R) Mackie, Lady Bruce, Bruce, Bateman and Hamerton at their lab in Uganda, 1908. The work in Africa represented a huge step forward in the understanding of trypanosome-related diseases not only in humans (using monkeys as models) but in domestic cattle and wild animals, including elephants. Some 17 publications arose from this work in which Mackie was a co- author. Of the many species of Trypanosoma studied only T. gambiense (now T. brucei gambiense) causes sleeping sickness in humans. The disease is spread by blood sucking insects of the genus Glossina, which include tse-tse flies. The researchers studied the length of time tse-tse flies retained the parasite, how long it took to mature, how long the flies remained capable of transmitting the infection, what proportion of flies were infected, how many were required to cause sickness, whether transmission could occur \\"mechanically\\" by surface contact of the fly's mouthparts, and many other aspects. In a critical series of experiments it was found that the flies remained infective for up to 75 days after becoming infected themselves and that a tiny drop of fluid taken from the gut of the 75-day-old fly injected under the skin of a monkey gave rise to sleeping sickness after an incubation period of eight days.Bruce, D; Hamerton, AE; Bateman, HR; Mackie FP; 1909. Proc. Roy. Soc. B: 81, 405-414 The Commission's work served to reassure the Indian Government that there was no risk of sleeping sickness spreading to India as it was clear that only Glossina could carry the infection and no species of this genus were native to India. ===Kala-Azar=== Mackie was recalled to India in 1909 and appointed Special Research Officer (Government of India) for the investigation of kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis). In 1914 he studied cases of kala-azar in Nowgong, Assam, where there were many cases of the disease among the local population. He noted that anopheline mosquitoes were rare, but species of Culex and Phlebotomus (sand flies) were common. Examination of 273 patients showed an abundance of LD bodies (cells infected with a non-motile stage of the parasite Leishmania donovani) in the blood and in splenic biopsies. Mackie captured insects on fly papers and examined them for stages of the parasite. He found flagellated forms of the parasite in sand flies of the genus Phlebotomus. The topographical distribution of kala-azar closely matched the distribution of the sand flies. This pointed to sand flies as the blood-sucking insects that serve as vectors for the disease. Other workers were engaged in similar investigations elsewhere in India, and it was unclear who had priority, but it was eventually accepted that ‚ÄúF.P. Mackie was probably the first to note this association. The only insect which has given any return for the work put into it is the sandfly.‚ÄùScott, H.H. 1939.

Percival Mackie, ‚ÄúIn Mesopotamia. Up the Tigris to Amara‚Äù (Times of India, 4 February 1916) and ‚ÄúThe Road to Mosul‚Äù (The Baghdad Times, 7 and 8 February 1919). Late in 1915, the British campaign to end Ottoman control of Mesopotamia was focussed on relief of the besieged British forces at Kut, where the British 6th Army Division was engaging Turkish forces, with heavy casualties on both sides. Mackie brought a fully equipped laboratory from France to Basra. From there he was directed to proceed to Amara where there were thousands of British and Indian military personnel in hospitals, few of which had adequate pathology backup. Rather than equipping every hospital with fully equipped testing laboratories, the British established central laboratories, first in Amara and, after it was liberated, Baghdad. The larger hospitals were gradually provided with the necessary materials and trained staff to become more self-sufficient. Furthermore, mobile units were established which could be rapidly despatched to areas experiencing sudden disease outbreaks. F.P. Mackie, Major, IMS, 1918 Mackie, now Major, was Commanding Officer of the Central Bacteriological Laboratory in Amara from 1916 to 1918, when he took charge of the much larger one in Baghdad, with supervisory responsibilities over all clinical testing units in the city along with those concerned with water quality testing and veterinary pathology. The principle diseases encountered were enteric fever and dysentery, both bacterial and amoeboid. There were several outbreaks of cholera, in one of which General Sir Stanley Maude (whose forces had captured Baghdad) succumbed. Malaria was also prevalent and there were villages where ‚Äúpractically every child was diseased.‚Äù Plague epidemics had to be dealt with in all the major cities. In a 1919 address, Mackie emphasized the importance of close cooperation between pathologists in their labs and physicians on the hospital floor. At the same time, on the basis of his observations in India and Mesopotamia, he stressed that while much of the work in pathology labs was routine, the pathologist's ‚Äúgreatest work is to discover the beginnings of disease and to study the underlying processes‚Ä¶‚Äù Mackie was twice mentioned in dispatches for his war work and the award of O.B.E. was conferred upon him on June 3, 1918. ===1920‚Äì1931 administrative work=== In 1920 Mackie was professor of pathology at Calcutta University, but after a year took up the position of Director of the Pasteur Institute in Shillong, Assam, and was simultaneously appointed Honorary Surgeon to the Viceroy (VHS). Two years later, promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, he became Director of the Haffkine Institute in Bombay (previously the Plague Research Laboratory), a position he held until his retirement from the IMS in 1932. In a letter written in 1923 to his future wife Mary Owen, Mackie summarized his main responsibilities as Director of the Haffkine Institute as (a) overseeing the preparation of an anti-plague vaccine which was sent all over the Eastern world from Cape Town to Japan, about a million doses a year (b) supervision of a Pasteurian section for anti-rabies treatment (c) overseeing collection of snake venom from snakes held at the Institute's own snake farm for production of antivenoms (d) conducting his own individual research, e.g. working closely with Neil Hamilton Fairley on schistosomiasis and sprue (e) serving, effectively, as the court of appeal in all matters for the Province as regards epidemiology, pathology etc.See further in Far Cathay In 1928, Mackie was appointed chairman of the plague committee of the League of Nations and public health commissioner to the Government of India. He repeatedly represented the Government of India at the Office International d‚ÄôHygi√®ne Publique between 1919 and 1930 and at the League of Nations between 1926 and 1931. Mackie was President of the tropical diseases section at the centenary meeting of the British Medical Association in 1925 and President of the medical and veterinary section of the Indian Science Congress in 1925. These administrative jobs doubtless involved much tedious paperwork and attendance at meetings, but they also offered opportunities for travel to interesting places, including trips to distant countries, which he much enjoyed. In 1926, for instance, he visited Japan and China under the auspices of the League of Nations and came away very impressed with the quality and organization of the health care system in Japan, comparing it favourably with health care and staff training in India. One hospital in Osaka ‚Äúwould be credit to any great city in Europe or America.‚Äù Not so in China: ‚ÄúIt may be of some consolation to India to know that she is as far ahead of China in matters of public health as Japan is ahead of India.‚ÄùMackie, F.P. 1927. \\"The Interchange of Health Personnel in Japan.\\" Ind Med Gaz 62 (3) 158-164. His travels took him around the world on two separate occasions. In 1942 he recalled that he had ‚ÄúRepresented the Government on International Commissions in Paris, Warsaw, Rangoon, Bangkok, Singapore, Tokio and Peking, returning from the last by the Trans-Siberian Railway.‚ÄùTypescript biography or press release of Col.

Hamerton notes, though he did much important primary research, his major contributions lay in the administrative sphere of tropical hygiene: ‚ÄúNeither fads nor fancies nor self interest obscured his professional or social affairs. He was a good speaker, lucid, balanced and brief‚Ä¶. he was always gay and of ready wit, especially in difficulties.‚ÄùColonel A.E. Hamerton, ‚ÄúColonel F.P. Mackie.

When his Indian colleagues at the Pasteur Institute heard of his receipt of the CSI, they wrote to congratulate him. ‚ÄúWe beg respectfully to congratulate you‚Ä¶. We very much wish we could still have you in our midst. A very kind heart peeping through a stern front is what we lovingly remember of you.

Letter in private collection. ===Back in England=== Soon after leaving India, in 1932, he joined the staff of the London School of Tropical Medicine (now the London Hospital for Tropical Diseases) as pathologist and remained there for five years. He was also lecturer at the University of London. In this period he published a paper on the pathology of the brain in trypanosomiasis, and he continued to collaborate with Hamilton Fairley on a form of sprue occurring in Britain and seemingly distinct from ‚Äòtropical sprue‚Äô they had worked on earlier. In 1937 Mackie joined Imperial Airways as Medical Advisor, becoming Chief Medical Officer two years later with the fusion of Imperial and British Airways into the British Overseas Airways Corporation. An obituarist noted that ‚Äúhe surprised his friends by taking, despite his age, the appointment of chief medical officer of the British Overseas Airways Corporation. In this capacity he travelled thousands of miles from one end of Africa to the other, not apparently in any way affected by heat or fatigue, and was able to his great delight to view from the air herds of game in those vast wild regions where, as a young man, he hunted them on foot.‚Äù While at BOAC, one of his main preoccupations was to minimize the risk of insect-borne disease transmission by aeroplanes. He journeyed by air to tropical colonies in Africa and Asia to supervise the sanitary requirements of the chain of airports then being established. His particular interest was the prevention of yellow fever, and he introduced thorough fumigation of aircraft against all bloodsucking and disease-carrying insects.In January 1939, as Medical Advisor of Imperial Airways, Mackie and C.B. Symes authored a map entitled \\"Air Traffic in Africa, with Special Reference to Yellow Fever.‚Äù Private collection. In 1942, he wrote that ‚ÄúDuring his five years with Airways he has (with Mr. Crabtree) effected a method of destroying mosquitoes in aircraft, and has been a persistent advocate for using oxygen in the Corporation‚Äôs aircraft on high altitude flying. After repeated flying tours he is personally acquainted with almost all stations on the Horseshoe and Trans-African routes.‚ÄùTypescript biography of Col. F.P. Mackie, 1942. See also F.P. Mackie and H.S. Crabtree, ‚ÄúDestruction of Mosquitoes in Aircraft,‚Äù Lancet 447 (August 20, 1938). ==Marriages and children== Percival Mackie married Gladys Ball in November 1913 at St. Paul's Cathedral, Calcutta, but with the outbreak of war in 1914 the couple saw little of each other. He calculated that in the four years they had been married up to 1917, he and Gladys had spent only 19 months and 19 days together. In April 1920, Gladys gave birth to a son, Lawrence Percival, but the following year she fell seriously ill with multiple sclerosis and had to be taken back to England for treatment. After her death in 1922, Mackie took an extended leave and returned to India via the western route, visiting the United States, Canada (where two of his brothers had settled),For his 1922 visit to the Okanagan, see George Mackie, Peter Mackie, and Richard Mackie, editors, ‚ÄúOkanagan Impressions: The 1922 Diary of Percival Mackie,‚Äù Okanagan History 68 (2004), pp. 11-27. Japan, China, Mongolia, Korea, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Burma. His account of this trip has been edited and combined with his photographs in a memoir entitled Far Cathay. In 1926, he married Mary Elizabeth Haddon Owen, daughter of a Lincolnshire solicitor, who bore him two children, Richard Ernest (1927) and George Owen Mackie (1929). ===Last years and death=== During the height of the air raids in Bristol during the 1939-45 war, Percival Mackie was an active ARP (air raid precautions) warden and first-aid rescue worker in the streets. He died in a nursing home in Bristol after a series of heart attacks on July 15, 1944, and was buried at Thornbury Cemetery. A.E. Hamerton, who described himself as Mackie's ‚Äúbest friend,‚Äù suggested to his widow Mary Mackie that ‚Äúwell known & distinguished ‚Ä¶ people,‚Äù friends and former colleagues like Sir Philip Manson- Bahr, Sir Leonard Rogers, J.W.D. Megaw, Sir Neil Hamilton Fairley, and Sir Rickard Christophers should ‚Äúcontribute an obituary note on his career & work.‚ÄùA.E. Hamerton to Mary Mackie, July 18, 1944, and August 4, 1944, private collection. Appreciations of his life and work duly appeared in The Lancet, August 19, 1944 (co-written by Manson-Bahr and Hamerton); The Times, August 19, 1944; Nature; the British Medical Journal; The Indian Medical Gazette; (vol LXXX, 1945); and the Royal College of Surgeons, which concluded that, ‚ÄúMackie was one of the most distinguished medical scientists who have served in India, and after retirement from the Indian Medical Service his abilities were in demand at home. His work on plague, relapsing fever, sleeping sickness, kala-azar, enteric dysentery, cholera, schistosomiasis, hydrophobia, and sprue was original and of first rate quality; but his administrative gifts and their contribution to tropical hygiene were of almost higher value.‚Äù A scholarship in Mackie's name has been established at Bristol University. The Gr√ºbler stains he used for his histological work and for identifying blood parasites are now in the permanent collection of the Royal College of Surgeons Museum in London. The publications cited in this article are a small fraction of the total.

M. Samuel, a Sydney musician. She was working as a waitress and had only been cycling for a few months when she decided to ride from Melbourne to Sydney, a 575-mile trip, in an attempt to beat the women's world record for that distance. The record at the time was held by Elsa Barbour for her 1932 ride from Sydney to Melbourne. Samuel was trained by controversial Australian endurance cyclist Ossie Nicholson who had been banned for allegedly interfering with another record attempt. His ban was lifted eventually after Samuel completed her ride from Melbourne to Sydney in May 1934. It took her 3 days, 17 hours, and 2 minutes, which was not fast enough to beat Barbour's record of 3 days, 7 hours, and 32 minutes. Samuel crashed twice on her ride and faced inclement weather. On July 4, 1934, Samuel left Sydney to ride back to Melbourne, attempting again to beat Barbour's record. This time, the weather was fair, and Samuel succeeded in setting the new world record of 3 days, 1 hour, and 20 minutes. Samuel weighed 91 lbs. at the time, making her the lightest woman champion, a record she held until at least 1971.

On the occasion of the return of Santos Dumont, several honours were organized, including the over-flight of the SS Cap Arcona by two Dornier Do J Wal flying boats of the Condor Syndicate. == Accident== The SS Cap Arcona in 1927. The Dornier Do Js, P-BAIA Guanabara and P-BACA Santos Dumont, took off from Guanabara Bay and flew over the Cap Arcona, where they sent welcome messages to Alberto Santos Dumont. The Santos Dumont was flown by August Wilhem Paschen and was carrying nine passengers and crew, including friends of Santos Dumont and personalities of the time. Due to the error of one of the pilots, the two aircraft entered a collision course, forcing the pilots to perform evasive maneuvers. The Guanabara escaped unscathed from the near collision, but the Santos Dumont crashed into Guanabara Bay, watched by the crew and passengers of the Arcona, including Santos Dumont. Depressed, he suspended the festivities and returned to Paris. Despite rescue efforts led by the Brazilian Navy destroyers Amazonas and Par√°, only the mechanic of the aircraft, Walter Hasseldorf, survived the crash, dying hours later. Among the dead in the disaster was Dr. Amaury de Medeiros, the mathematician, Manuel Amoroso Costa, Tobias Moscoso, Ferdinando Labouriau, Frederico de Oliveira Coutinho and Paulo de Castro Maia. During the removal of the bodies and the remains of the aircraft, a Brazilian Navy diver died. ==Consequences== After witnessing the accident, Santos Dumont became depressed, canceling the festivities and returning to France.

The matches resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches, with results predetermined by WWE's writers on the SmackDown brand. Storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television show SmackDown Live. On the May 21 episode of SmackDown, Dolph Ziggler, who had been inactive since January's Royal Rumble event, made a surprise return and attacked Kofi Kingston. Ziggler, a Raw wrestler appearing via the wild card rule, later explained that it should have been him who got the opportunity to go to WrestleMania 35 and win the WWE Championship instead of Kingston. Ziggler, who was in turn moved to SmackDown, then lost to Kingston at both Super ShowDown and Stomping Grounds. On the June 24 episode of Raw, after Kingston had defeated both Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn in consecutive singles matches, Kingston was randomly attacked by Raw's Samoa Joe, who performed an \\"uranage\\" on Kingston. As referees tended to the champion, Joe returned and applied the \\"Coquina Clutch\\" on Kingston. Kingston would defeat Joe at Extreme Rules. On July 18, a WWE Championship Triple Threat match between the three wrestlers was announced for Smackville. At Money in the Bank, Bayley won the women's Money in the Bank ladder match and later that night cashed in the contract on Charlotte Flair to win the SmackDown Women's Championship. On the June 4 episode of SmackDown, Flair competed in a triple threat match against Carmella and Raw's Alexa Bliss, who appeared via the wild card rule, in order to earn a rematch against Bayley for the title at Stomping Grounds. Bliss, however, won the match, thus Bliss earned the title match at Stomping Grounds, but lost. She and Cross then faced Bayley at Extreme Rules in a two-on-one handicap match for the title, but the two were defeated by Bayley. On July 18, a SmackDown Women's Championship triple threat match between Bayley, Flair, and Bliss was announced for Smackville, though this match was not shown on the WWE Network special. During the Extreme Rules pre-show, Shinsuke Nakamura defeated Finn B√°lor to win the Intercontinental Championship. A rematch was later scheduled for Smackville; however, B√°lor was removed from the match on July 27 after suffering an undisclosed injury and was replaced by Ali.

Unlike previous albums which featured some musical writing contribution from Luke Pabich and Chuck Platt, Thoughts and Prayers was solely written by frontman Russ Rankin. ==Background== Following the band's reunion in 2012 and the performance of a few shows, Good Riddance returned to the studio. From those studio sessions came Peace in Our Time, released on April 21, 2015. Four years later, on May 16, 2019, the band announced the upcoming release of a new studio album titled Thoughts and Prayers on Instagram. With that announcement came the early release of the track \\"Don't Have Time.\\" Four weeks later, the band released \\"Our Great Divide\\" as a preview as well. On July 17, two days before the official release date, British rock magazine Kerrang! released a free stream of the album on YouTube. The early release also came with a short description of the lyrical message behind every track. ==Critical Reception== Reception towards the album is generally positive. Punknews awarded the album 7 out of 10 stars, commenting that the album starts strong and that the band \\"hasn't lost one bit of edge.

It is based on the real story of the Dozier School, a reform school in Florida that operated for 111 years and had its history exposed by a university's investigation. It was named one of TIMEs best books of the decade. It is the follow-up to Whitehead's 2016 novel The Underground Railroad, which won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. The Nickel Boys won the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Judges of the prize called the novel \\"a spare and devastating exploration of abuse at a reform school in Jim Crow-era Florida that is ultimately a powerful tale of human perseverance, dignity and redemption.\\" It is Whitehead's second win, making him the fourth writer in history to have won the prize for fiction twice. ==Plot== Set in the 1960s, the novel follows Elwood Curtis, a studious African American from Tallahassee with a sense of justice, who is adjudicated delinquent and sent to Nickel Academy, a juvenile reformatory in Eleanor, Florida, after riding in a stolen vehicle to attend university classes. He befriends Jack Turner, who goes by his family name and who has a less optimistic viewpoint. Elwood attempts to serve his time without incident, but is seriously beaten on two occasions, once for intervening to help a boy being attacked by sexual predators and once after writing a letter complaining of poor conditions. The time at the school is interspersed with accounts of an older Elwood in New York City. After Turner overhears of a plan to have Elwood killed by the administration, the two attempt an escape. Elwood is shot dead while Turner escapes; the latter had in fact falsely adopted Elwood's name to live up to his ideals and had established a business in New York City. When an investigation in the 2010s finally begins to expose the now shuttered school's secrets, Turner flies to Tallahassee to give testimony to his friend's fate. ==Characters== Whitehead has described the characters as \\"two different parts of my personality\\", with Elwood Curtis being \\"the optimistic or hopeful part of me that believes we can make the world a better place if we keep working at it\\", and Jack Turner, \\"the cynical side that says no‚Äîthis country is founded on genocide, murder, and slavery and it will always be that way.\\" ==Development and writing== After dealing with slavery in his Pulitzer-prize winning novel, The Underground Railroad, Whitehead did not want to write \\"another heavy book.\\" However, he felt the election of Donald Trump compelled him to do so. Whitehead deliberately narrowed the scope of the book and grounded it for the sake of realism, choosing not to include the speculative or fantastic elements of his other novels Zone One or The Underground Railroad. The Nickel Boys is set at a fictionalized version of the Dozier School for Boys, dubbed Nickel Academy. Whitehead first heard of the real life Dozier School on Twitter in 2014. The school opened in 1900 and closed in 2011. The state of Florida ran Dozier, in Marianna, as a reform school. After decades of allegations against the school for allowing the beatings, rapes, torture, and even murder of students by guards and employees, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement began an investigation of the claims in 2010, followed by additional investigations by the United States Department of Justice in 2011, and an ongoing forensic investigation by the University of South Florida which began in 2012. The Department of Justice investigation revealed ‚Äúsystemic, egregious, and dangerous practices exacerbated by a lack of accountability and controls.‚ÄùUnited States Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division.

Parul Sehgal, writing in The New York Times, said \\"Whitehead has written novels of horror and apocalypse; nothing touches the grimness of the real stories he conveys here.\\" The Washington Post critic Ron Charles wrote, \\"It shreds our easy confidence in the triumph of goodness and leaves in its place a hard and bitter truth about the ongoing American experiment.\\" Writing in NPR, Maureen Corrigan said \\"It's a masterpiece squared, rooted in history and American mythology and, yet, painfully topical in its visions of justice and mercy erratically denied.\\" The New Republic exclaimed, \\"The Nickel Boys is fiction, but it burns with outrageous truth.\\" Meanwhile, The Guardian wrote, \\"He demonstrates to superb effect how racism in America has long operated as a codified and sanctioned activity intended to enrich one group at the expense of another.\\" ==Awards and recognition== * Winner, 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction{https://www.pulitzer.org/news/announcement-2020-pulitzer-prize- winners} * Winner, 2019 Kirkus Prize for Fiction * Winner, 2020 Alex Award * Longlist, 2019 National Book Award for Fictionhttps://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-2019/ * Finalist, 2019 National Book Critics Circle Award for Fictionhttps://www.bookcritics.org/2020/01/11/announcing-the-finalists-for- the-2019-nbcc-awards/ * Winner, 2020 Orwell Prize for Political Fictionhttps://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell- prizes/2020-prizes/longlists/ * Finalist, 2020 Audie Award for Best Male Narratorhttps://www.audiopub.org/winners/2020-audies ==References== Category:2019 American novels Category:Novels by Colson Whitehead Category:Novels set in Florida Category:Novels set in New York City Category:Doubleday (publisher) books Category:Pulitzer Prize for Fiction- winning works ","title":"The Nickel Boys"},{"id":"61310771","text":"Deena Errampalli, Ph.

The heptathlon was first held in 1990 and became a regular fixture from 2005 onwards. A 400 m hurdles event was introduced in 1978. The women's field events reached parity with the men's after the addition of triple jump in 1990, the hammer throw in 1992 and the pole vault in 1998. From the period 1990‚Äì2004 women competed in racewalking, but this was dropped later. The women's steeplechase was the last event to be added to the schedule, with women first competing in a national championship event in 2003. ==References== Category:Athletics competitions in Turkey Category:National athletics competitions Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1922 Category:1922 establishments in Turkey Athletics ","title":"Turkish Athletics Championships"},{"id":"61311023","text":"Abashidze () is a Georgian surname == Notable people with the name == *the house of Abashidze a Georgian princely family *Ana Abashidze, Georgian princess *Aslan Abashidze, Georgian politician, separatist leader in the Ajarian Autonomous Republic in western Georgia *Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze, Georgian nobleman, became king George VI of Imereti *Grigol Abashidze, Georgian poet *Haidar Abashidze, Georgian politician, journalist, and educator *Irakli Abashidze, Georgian poet, literary scholar and politician *Ivane Abashidze, Georgian nobleman, one of the leaders of the 1819 Imeretian Uprising, claimant to the throne of Imereti *Kita Abashidze, Georgian literary critic, journalist, and politician *Levan Abashidze (died 1757), Georgian prince, maternal grandfather of Solomon I of Imereti *Memed Abashidze, Georgian politician, writer and public benefactor *Nunu Abashydze, Ukrainian athlete, bronze medalist for the Soviet Union in 1982 European Athletics Championships *Vaso Abashidze, Georgian theater actor and a founder of a realistic acting tradition in Georgia *Antoni (Abashidze), bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church of Georgian origins, active in Russian, Georgia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.

Predating the 1st Scripps National Spelling Bee in 1925 by seventeen years, this 1908 competition was the first national spelling bee in the United States. Cleveland won the team competition, and Marie C. Bolden was the individual champion. == Competition == The spelling bee was part of the forty-sixth annual convention of the National Education Association (NEA), which was held in Cleveland. The NEA invited teams to compete from across the United States and promoted the competition as the first national spelling bee. Six thousand people, including convention speaker Booker T. Washington, attended the event at the Hippodrome. Unlike the later Scripps National Spelling Bee competitions, the 1908 NEA Spelling Bee was an inter-city contest, with teams of fifteen eighth-graders each participating from Cleveland, Erie, Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh, and New Orleans. For the competition, each student took a written spelling test of one hundred words, and then spelled four words aloud on stage. The total number of spelling mistakes in both the written and verbal competitions determined the winning team. The Cleveland team won the competition with the fewest errors, followed by Pittsburgh in second place, New Orleans in third place, and Erie, Pennsylvania in fourth. Marie C. Bolden, a thirteen-year-old black girl, was the only Cleveland speller with no errors, so she was named the individual champion and received a gold medal. == Controversy == Even before the competition, some members of the all-white New Orleans team took offense at competing on the same stage with racially integrated teams such as Cleveland's. After Marie Bolden and the Cleveland team won the competition, New Orleans school superintendent Warren Easton apologized to the people of New Orleans, promised that New Orleans students would not participate in any other contests in Northern states, and was censured by the New Orleans school board for allowing white students to compete against a black speller. Also in New Orleans, after Marie Bolden's victory, the local black YMCA organized a spelling bee to be held in her honor. However, under pressure from mayor Martin Behrman due to high tensions \\"over race questions\\", the event was canceled. In the written portion of the competition, pronouncer Solomon Henry Clark gave an incorrect example for the word \\"capitol\\", causing many spellers to write it as \\"capital\\". After the second-place Pittsburgh team and others raised concerns, the spelling bee organizers re-scored the written tests. After re-scoring, the teams kept their overall rankings, but Marie Bolden no longer had a perfect score, and two other girls on the Cleveland team did. Marie Bolden was still allowed to keep her gold medal and title as champion. == References == Category:Spelling competitions Category:1908 in Ohio Category:1908 in education Category:June 1908 events Category:1900s in Cleveland Category:Education in Cleveland Category:African-American history in Cleveland ","title":"1908 National Education Association Spelling Bee"},{"id":"61311301","text":"The King Fahad Industrial Port (Yanbu) is a Saudi port located in Yanbu city of Saudi Arabia on the Red sea coast.

The album was released in Japan on December 5, 2018 by Victor Entertainment, and in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand two days later by Arising Empire. JPU Records released it in the United Kingdom on January 18, 2019. It reached number 21 on the Oricon chart and number 23 on Billboard Japan. ==Background== Lovebites started recording Clockwork Immortality before the June 6, 2018 release of their second EP, Battle Against Damnation. Several of the songs began during the making of the EP. The band created a list of what \\"qualities\\" they wanted to include on the album before Miho, Miyako, and Asami started writing in their own teams with their frequent collaborator, Light Bringer keyboardist Mao. Miyako recorded all of her guitar parts at her home studio using a Dean USA Icon guitar before re-amping, using a Peavey 6505 for the lead and solos and a Marshall for backing. Bassist and bandleader Miho described Clockwork Immortality as featuring \\"the strongest, most powerful elements\\" of Battle Against Damnation, with the \\"speedy and melodic elements\\" of their first album, Awakening from Abyss. Guitarist Midori described it as still rooted in power metal and featuring \\"notable influences from thrash metal and speed metal.\\" But she noted that they did experiment with acoustic guitars and adopted a different approach to some songs in order to add a \\"little variation\\" to their sound in addition to including their first ballad. Like all of their releases, it was mixed by Mikko Karmila and mastered by Mika Jussila at Finnvox Studios in Helsinki, Finland. Also returning, The EasyRabbit CreArtions provided the cover art of a wolf smashing through an hourglass; illustrated by Spanish artist David L√≥pez G√≥mez and designed by G√≥mez and Carlos Vincente Le√≥n. The wolf, which also appeared on the band's previous two releases, symbolizes that by playing the non-mainstream genre of heavy metal Lovebites are a \\"lone wolf\\" in the music scene. Midori described the art as visualizing the meaning of the album title; \\"treasure every moment of your time.\\" ==Themes== With this second album, Asami said that she has gotten used to writing English lyrics. Miho described the opening riff of \\"Pledge of the Saviour\\" as a good mixture between melodic power metal and the musicality from Midori and Miyako's metalcore backgrounds. For the piano and vocal part in the middle of \\"Rising\\", Miyako wanted to pay respect to Chopin. The slightly progressive metal track \\"Empty Daydream\\" was originally made for Battle Against Damnation, but did not pass the EP's final song selection and was instead kept for the album. \\"Mastermind 01\\" was the last song that Miyako wrote for the album and Miho compared it to \\"Scream for Me\\" off of Awakening from Abyss. Asami's fast vocal delivery slightly reminded both of them of rap music. \\"M.D.O.\\" was made specifically so an audience could sing along live. Its title stands for \\"Most Destructive Outset\\" and its lyrical theme was inspired by the Resurrection arc of the manga series Phoenix by Osamu Tezuka. Miho wrote the lyrics to \\"Journey to the Otherside\\" about her family, while those of \\"The Final Collision\\" seek to inspire from a personal suffering she was going through at the time. The final ballad track \\"Epilogue\\" is the first metal song Asami has ever written. Miyako admitted that despite its few notes, it was the song that took the most takes to record her guitars for as the slightest mistake was noticeable. Its outro subtly includes the theme from the opening track, \\"Addicted\\". ==Release== Clockwork Immortality was released in Japan on December 5, 2018 by Victor Entertainment. Limited editions of the album include either a DVD or Blu-ray of the concert video Battle in the East, which was recorded on June 28, 2018 at Tsutaya O-East. The album was supported by the six-date Clockwork Immortality Tour in Japan 2019, from January 12 to February 23. Victor released a limited edition 2-disc vinyl LP record version of the album, titled in Japanese, on November 6, 2019 with new liner notes by Masanori Ito. Lovebites' performance at Germany's Wacken Open Air in August 2018 earned them a contract with Arising Empire. The label released the album in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand two days after its Japanese release. While JPU Records released it in the United Kingdom on January 18, 2019. ==Reception== Clockwork Immortality reached number 21 on the Oricon Albums Chart and stayed on the chart for six weeks. It peaked at number 23 on Billboard Japans Hot Albums chart. However, it reached number 21 on Billboard Japans Top Albums Sales chart, which is based only on physical sales. Giving the album a near perfect 9.5/10, Andy Thorley of Maximum Volume Music believes it proves Lovebites are one of the finest metal bands around and suggested that Clockwork Immortality might be the greatest metal album ever recorded by an all-woman group. Dead Rhetoric's Matt Coe wrote that the album reminds him of the best of Visions-era Stratovarius, Helloween's classic Keeper of the Seven Keys records, and \\"the magnificence of early Angra.\\" He called Lovebites one of the strongest Japanese bands that \\"could seriously make a solid dent into international success based on their output.\\" Citing \\"Mastermind 01\\" and \\"Pledge of the Saviour\\" as highlights, Dannii Leivers of Metal Hammer claimed Clockwork Immortality is without a bad song as each \\"stands tall and defiant, brilliantly crafted and memorable in its own right.\\" They finished by stating \\"Believe the hype, ladies and gentlemen. Lovebites are the full package.\\" Jovan Ristiƒá of Hardwired wrote that \\"From the first notes of the opener \\"Addicted\\" down to the cheesy power ballad in \\"Epilogue\\", the album invokes the glory days of power metal, but with a fresh take.\\" Feeling that all of the songs are recognizable and catchy, he cited \\"The Final Collision\\" and \\"Rising\\" as standouts showing the musicians' musical capabilities. Calling the songs engaging, inventive and inspiring, Hysterias Audrey Gerrard believes Clockwork Immortality represents another step closer towards Lovebites finding its unique blend of power metal \\"with a range of stylistic strengths at the core of the various tracks.\\" Ali Cooper of Distorted Sound gave the album a 7/10 and praised the skills of the guitarists and Asami's vocals, but felt several aspects were predictable and \\"cookie-cutting.\\" ==Track listingPersonnel== Lovebites *Asami ‚Äì vocals *Midori ‚Äì guitars *Miyako ‚Äì guitars, acoustic guitars and keyboards *Miho ‚Äì bass guitar *Haruna ‚Äì drums Other *Mao ‚Äì keyboards and programming *Steve Jacobs ‚Äì production *Mikko Karmila ‚Äì mixing *Mika Jussila ‚Äì mastering ==ReferencesCategory:2018 albums Category:Lovebites albums Category:Victor Entertainment albums ","title":"Clockwork Immortality"},{"id":"61311391","text":"Sir Charles Frederick Richmond Brown, 4th Baronet TD DL (6 December 1902 ‚Äì 9 July 1995) was a British soldier. ==Early life== Charles Frederick Richmond Brown was born on 6 December 1902.

She is best known for her debut novel Delayed Rays of A Star, published by Doubleday in July 2019, and for being the youngest winner of the Singapore Literature Prize. == Early life  Childhood === Koe was born in Singapore, the oldest of three children to Chinese parents who both worked for Singapore Airlines, her father as a pilot and her mother as a flight stewardess. Her father took her traveling solo with him as a child, and her mother read her fairytales. Her paternal grandfather was an opium-smoking Teochew laborer from Guangdong who emigrated to Singapore. Growing up on Tsui Hark wuxia films and Disney movies in the 1990s in Singapore, Koe describes her cultural experience as \\"omnivorous\\". She said: \\"I was always most drawn to the villainess. Brigitte Lin as the Bride with White Hair, that was my favorite movie. I loved Cruella de Vil to bits.\\" Koe used to dress her younger siblings up as wuxia characters like Monkey God and the Eight Immortals, where she led them on adventures with \\"contiguous plots from day to day\\". === Teenage years === As a teenager in an all-girls school in Singapore, Koe said she hated the rote education she received and rebelled against it. Koe fell in love with a female Uyghur soccer player when her softball team went on a training trip to Shanghai, and was sent to corrective counseling when teachers found out she had a girlfriend. Koe said she had \\"zero visible queer role models\\", was labeled \\"wrong\\", \\"abnormal\\", and pressurized to change. When she was 15, Koe watched The Hours in a mall. The Media Development Authority of Singapore had censored three lesbian kisses between Nicole Kidman, who played Virginia Woolf, and Miranda Richardson; Julianne Moore and Toni Colette; Meryl Streep and Allison Janey. This act of censorship led Koe to search for the deleted scenes on YouTube, which led to her discovering a fan video of Greta Garbo kissing a woman in Queen Christina, and Marlene Dietrich kissing a woman in Morocco. The publicly bisexual Dietrich became Koe's idol. As a teenager, Koe had a poster of Dietrich on her bedroom wall. As a result, she became interested in Weimar culture, describing \\"a great affinity for Dada, Surrealism\\". She went on to major in cinema studies as an undergraduate in Singapore, where she recalled crying while watching Wim Wenders's Wings of Desire. She studied German, but after completing three modules, there were no further course offerings within her school, so she dropped the language. === Young adulthood === Upon graduation, Koe wrote to Cahiers du cin√©ma for a job, but received no response. She next applied to work as a dancer with burlesque clubs in Germany and Australia, also receiving no response. She sold vintage and handmade clothes on Etsy for a time. Koe then marketed herself as an au pair who could coach children in Mandarin on a European forum. There was interest, but her work visa application ran into issues. While working as a waitress in a Japanese restaurant and freelancing for a creative agency, Koe had a manic episode. She quit everything and started writing. == Career  Singapore === In her early career in Singapore, Koe wrote short stories and supported herself with editorial work on the side. She was the fiction editor of Esquire Singapore, and the editor of the National Museum of Singapore‚Äôs film criticism magazine, Cin√©math√®que Quarterly. The stories, written in bursts in her early 20s, became the collection Ministry of Moral Panic. Koe considers the collection to be \\"an early work (...) raw (...) but necessary for me at that time\\". The collection, Koe's first, unanimously won the Singapore Literature Prize in 2014, making her the youngest winner of Singapore's highest accolade for literature. The same year, Koe was selected for the University of Iowa's International Writing Program. Soon after, she received a scholarship to attend Columbia University‚Äôs Writing Program. === New York === Koe moved to New York in 2014. She used her $10,000 prize money from the Singapore Literature Prize to pay the rent of her Brooklyn apartment. While browsing for a Nan Goldin photobook at The Strand in Manhattan, Koe encountered an Alfred Eisenstaedt monograph with Marlene Dietrich on its cover. Inside the book was a photograph of Marlene Dietrich, Anna May Wong, and Leni Riefenstahl together. The photograph had been taken when they had met at a ball in Berlin in 1928, before all three women had achieved fame. Koe said she knew from the moment she saw this photograph that it was what she wanted to work on for her debut novel, because it was \\"the intimate gap in history, the lateral wormhole in time\\", that would allow her to \\"transcend (my) own limited time and space in a way that could be aesthetic and rigorous\\". The working manuscript for Delayed Rays of a Star won the Henfield Prize in 2017, awarded to the best work of fiction in Columbia University‚Äôs Writing Program. Koe was signed to the Wylie Agency, and the manuscript sold to Doubleday before she graduated. == Work  Fiction === Ministry of Moral Panic  Ministry of Moral Panic was published by Singaporean independent press Epigram Books in 2013. The collection caused a sensation in Singapore's literary landscape when it was published, for its uncommon and unflinching depiction of idiosyncratic characters from social peripheries told via inventive narratives that questioned the conservative Singaporean state's ideological imperatives. It was seen as \\"a subversive, artistic interpretation of how to challenge the homogenising power of a dominant discourse\\". Hannah Ming-yit Ho writes in Humanities (journal): > Koe's stories about idiosyncratic Singaporeans illustrate the way personal > experiences‚Äîof memory loss, homosexual tendencies, and emotional self- > expressions‚Äîare informed by, and in turn inform, the biopolitical regulation > of Singaporean citizens rendered objects of biopower. In this way, her > stories invite a meditation on the state, people and power. In addition to the Singapore Literature Prize, Ministry of Moral Panic was also shortlisted for the Haus der Kulturen der Welt‚Äôs Internationaler Literaturpreis, the Frankfurt Book Fair‚Äôs LiBeraturpreis, and longlisted for the Frank O‚ÄôConnor International Short Stories Award. Delayed Rays of a Star  Delayed Rays of a Star, Koe's first novel and her international debut, was published by Doubleday's Nan A. Talese imprint in July 2019. Publishers Weekly called it \\"ambitious and well-researched ... successfully melds historical fact with expansive and generous storytelling\\". Kirkus Reviews said: > For a novel so dense with historical fact and larger-than-life celebrity > cameos (everyone from John F. Kennedy to Walter Benjamin to David Bowie), > its portrayals are nuanced enough that each character comes off as deeply > human regardless of their fame or importance to the novel's plot ... It's > the steady accumulation of intimate details like these that creates a > sweeping sense of history that feels truly alive ... Expansive, complex, and > utterly engrossing. NPR said: > It is the moral tightropes each woman walks, and the razor thin edge between > fulfilling one's ambition and selling one's soul, that is at the core of the > novel (...) It is hard to summarize a sprawling and ambitious novel like > this, so I won't ‚Äî but it is expertly woven, its characters alive and full- > bodied. Blending questions about pop culture, war, and art, Delayed Rays of > a Star is that rare book that is neither high- nor low-brow, refusing such > facile dichotomies and playing, instead, in the messiness of the grey areas. === Non-fiction === Koe has advocated for the preservation of endangered modernist architecture in Singapore. She has also commented on the Singapore state's \\"value-free pragmatism\\", a ruling style put in place by the late founding father of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew. === Translation === Koe is a fluent Mandarin speaker and translator. She is working on a translation of Su Qing's Ten Years of Marriage, for which she was awarded a PEN/Heim Translation Grant. == Personal life == Koe has named S√∏ren Kierkegaard, Yasunari Kawabata, and early Vladimir Nabokov among her literary influences. She has stated the importance of cinema in her life, citing Alain Resnais and Marguerite Duras's Hiroshima mon amour, Chantal Akerman's Jeanne Dielman, Wong Kar-wai's Fallen Angels, Rainer Werner Fassbinder's The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant, and Ingmar Bergman's Cries and Whispers as films that have had a significant influence on her. Koe identifies as queer. She lives in Brooklyn with her partner, a filmmaker. == References  External links == * AmandaLeeKoe.com Category:1980s births Category:Living people Category:Singaporean people of Chinese descent Category:Singaporean emigrants to the United States Category:American women novelists Category:21st-century American novelists Category:21st-century American short story writers Category:American women short story writers Category:21st-century American women writers Category:LGBT people from Singapore Category:LGBT writers from the United States Category:Singapore Literature Prize winners Category:Iowa Writers' Workshop alumni Category:Columbia University alumni Category:LGBT American people of Asian descent ","title":"Amanda Lee Koe"},{"id":"61311523","text":"Bruzus or Brouzos () was a town of ancient Phrygia, in the Phrygian Pentapolis, inhabited during Roman and Byzantine times.

It is dedicated to the 53 Juneau residents of Japanese origin who were forcibly relocated and imprisoned in inland internment camps during World War II, as well as to recognize Juneau citizens for their helpful response when the families returned after the war. It is the first memorial in Alaska regarding the internment of Japanese Americans during the war.John Tanaka and the Empty Chair Panel - The Empty Chair: The Forced Removal and Relocation of Juneau's Japanese, 1941-1951 The title of the memorial refers to a student named John Tanaka, a Juneau High School valedictorian who was relocated a month before his graduation in May 1942. His classmates left an empty chair to recognize him, and, by extension, other local Japanese families, at their graduation ceremonies. ==Background== Much like the rest of the West Coast, Japanese immigrants began arriving at Alaska in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where they were drawn by fisheries, mining, logging, agriculture, and other labor-intensive industries. At the time of the Japanese immigration to Alaska, it was under a district status since 1884 and under a territorial status since 1912. Some migrated to Juneau, where they later operated businesses within the city. Unlike most of the West Coast, by 1941, the Japanese population in Alaska was generally small of roughly 200. Also, Japanese residents in Juneau were fairly well treated by their white neighbors. Their children were popular in school and most ethnic Japanese were well integrated into the city's community. ==Internment during World War II and aftermath== Valedictorian John Tanaka received his diploma at the Juneau High School gym during a special graduation ceremony on April 15, 1942 Following the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan and the U.S. entry into World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, which gave military commanders the authority to exclude specified persons from certain areas, paving way for the internment of Japanese Americans. Unlike California, Oregon, and Washington which were designated as military exclusion zones that evicted all Japanese residents there to inland internment camps, Alaska was not included on the list due to its small Japanese populace. Nevertheless, the territory's Japanese residents were forced to leave by the Western Defense Command, sealing the fate of all ethnic Japanese living throughout the West Coast.Education Collection Tanaka Family One of the notable ethnic Japanese from Juneau was John Tanaka, a Juneau High School valedictorian, who later served as an inspiration for the Empty Chair Memorial. His father, Shonosuke Tanaka, owned the popular City Cafe in the city for decades and was among the 15 Japanese nationals arrested by the FBI immediately after the Pearl Harbor attack, where they were incarcerated along with two German citizens for several months at Fort Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska. In April 1942, when all ethnic Japanese in Alaska were ordered to leave for internment camps inland, a special ceremony was held on the 15th at the school gymnasium where John received his diploma. During the official graduation in May 1942, Tanaka's classmates placed an empty wooden folding chair to symbolize his absence. By the end of April, a total of 53 persons of Japanese ancestry left their homes and businesses in Juneau to internment camps inland. John, his brother (William), his mother (Nobu), and his two sisters (Alice and Mary) were taken on a United States Army transport ship to Seattle for processing at Puyallup Assembly Center and then onto Minidoka War Relocation Center in Idaho, where they were incarcerated during the remainder of the war. Shonosuke would later be sent to the United States Department of Justice prison in Lordsburg, New Mexico for a few years before rejoining his family in 1944. While at Minidoka, John volunteered for the U.S. Army and served with the 442nd Infantry Regiment in Europe.Remembering John Tanaka, September 7, 2013 After the war, most Juneau Japanese families returned to the city and re-established themselves, including the Tanaka family. Welcomed back, they found that residents had watched out for their interests in their absence. Unlike Japanese elsewhere in the country, they were able to resume their prior lives without serious difficulties, a testament to the decency of the people living in Juneau in the mid 20th Century. Following his military discharge in 1946, John enrolled and graduated at the University of Washington where he later went to the St. Louis University School of Medicine and became an anesthesiologist. He died in 1978, survived by his wife, Jeanne Tanaka, and his five children. ==Memorial== In July 2012, Seattle artist Peter Reiquam submitted a preliminary proposal to the Empty Chair Project Steering Committee which has met with their approval. His design was inspired by a wooden folding chair that would have been used for John Tanaka, who left Juneau a month before the actual graduation ceremony in 1942 in which his classmates left for him to honor his absence. The project then took over a span of two years through fundraising and grants from various organizations including the National Park Service's Japanese American Confinement Sites program.The Empty Chair Project: A MEMORIAL TO THE WWII JAPANESE-AMERICAN INTERNEES OF JUNEAU, ALASKA On July 12, 2014, the Empty Chair Memorial was dedicated at Capital School Park in Juneau, with 200 people in attendance. More than 1,000 origami cranes were made for the ceremony. The memorial is a bronze reproduction of a simple folding chair and has a spartan aura, sequestered in the park with a jagged chunk of planked flooring. Reiquam said that: The names of the 53 people forced to leave their homes for internment camps during World War II are etched into the floor planks. The communal, military-style camps were ringed by barbed wire and guard towers. Mary Tanaka Abo, one of John Tanaka's sisters, attended the dedication ceremony along with her extended family, as well as Alice Tanaka Hikido, and Jeanne Tanaka, John's widow. ==See also== * Day of Remembrance (Japanese Americans) * Bainbridge Island Japanese American Exclusion Memorial * Fred Korematsu Day * Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism During World War II * Sakura Square ==ReferencesExternal links== *The Empty Chair Project: A MEMORIAL TO THE WWII JAPANESE-AMERICAN INTERNEES OF JUNEAU, ALASKA *The Empty Chair Americans for the Arts (AFTA) *The Empty Chair Project Brief History and Purpose Juneau Community Foundation Category:Buildings and structures in Juneau, Alaska Category:Internment of Japanese Americans Category:Japanese- American memorials Category:Monuments and memorials in Alaska ","title":"Empty Chair Memorial"},{"id":"61311549","text":"Brian R.

D. graduate from the Department of Soil Science at University of Manitoba. == Career == Grant worked as a research scientist at AAFC‚Äôs Brandon Research and Development Centre from 1986 to 2015. Her research investigated nutrient management for sustainable cropping in the prairies and developing practices to increase nutrients and protein concentration and reduce cadmium in crops. Grant's research includes cadmium-phosphorus work with Fertilizer Canada and a Phosphorus Fertilization Review recently completed in partnership with the University of Manitoba. Grant also worked to develop and assess beneficial management practices (BMPs) for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur and chloride to improve nutrient use efficiency, becoming one of the first Canadian researchers supported by the international Fluid Fertilizer Foundation. She has prepared dozens of technology transfer articles and presentations in North America, South America, Australia, Europe, and Asia on the usefulness of Enhanced Efficiency Fertilizers (EEFs) and 4R nutrient management practices in cropping systems. Grant has published over 180 journal articles on nutrient management with topics ranging from diversified cropping systems, crop nutrition, nutrient dynamics in tillage systems to trace element behaviour in soils and crops. As of July 2019, Grant was t he lead author of three of the ten most highly cited scientific papers in the Canadian Journal of Plant Science. In addition, she has co-authored chapters on soil fertility management in dryland agriculture and sulphur management and co-edited a book on Integrated Nutrient Management, given hundreds of extension presentations and written over 200 extension bulletins and reports for the benefit of agronomists, farmers and policy-makers. Her accomplishments have not only earned her significant respect and support from colleagues, managers, and peers, but also have led to national and international demands for her expertise and contributions to various agricultural, environmental, and health issues. Grant also served as an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Soil Science at the University of Manitoba. Grant has worked with the university as a research project leader, student supervisor or advisor, adjunct professor, mentor, co-investigator and co-author. She also served as Associate Editor of the Journal of Environmental Quality, Canadian Journal of Soil Science, and Canadian Journal of Plant Science. As of 2019, she was the only person to have served as president of both the Canadian Society of Agronomy and the Canadian Society of Soil Science. == Honours and awards == * International Fertilizer Industry Association Award for Young Professionals *The Robert E.
