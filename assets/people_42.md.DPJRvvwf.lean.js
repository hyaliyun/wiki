It was built by Fablok. ==History== The locomotive is based on a draft from the years 1927-1929; six locomotives of the factory designation T1A and T2A were built by Fablok. The technical documentation survived until after World War II and it was decided to develop it into a new class of locomotive, factory name Ferrum 47. 477 examples were delivered in the years 1948 - 1961 including to China, Romania and Hungary. The later designation were referred to as Ferrum 724. In China the locomotives were designated as XK 13 and several examples of the class were reported to be working in 1993, with at least three preserved thereafter. These locomotives worked exclusively in industry and were usually designated with TKh prefix, meaning 0-6-0T freight locomotives in PKP designation system, merged with factory numbers. Only in 1996 one locomotive was acquired by the Polish State Railways for its museum depot in Chab√≥wka, and was formally designated as TKh49 PKP class, namely TKh49-1.Pawe≈Ç Terczy≈Ñski: Najm≈Çodszy parow√≥z PKP [The youngest PKP steam locomotive], \\"≈öwiat Kolei\\" Nr. 2/1997, p.6 (in Polish) ==Preservation== A locomotive is preserved at the Museum of Vehicles and Railway Technology in Chab√≥wka, whilst three more are in other museums.

In his later work as a novelist he influenced the modernist writer James Joyce. The late 19th-century English novelist George Gissing read four of Keary's works, including three novels, in the first 31 days of 1896. He found the novel Herbert Vanlennert, \\"a long, conscientious, uninspired book\\".Pierre Coustillas, ed., London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, pp. 399 and 401‚Äì402. ==Early life== Charles was born to a Galway Irish family which had settled in the industrial Midlands borough of Stoke-on- Trent. He was the son of William Keary, who in 1874 would become the first mayor of Stoke-on-Trent. He was schooled at Marlborough College and took his degree at Trinity College, Cambridge. ==Specialisms== Keary then became fascinated by Scandinavian history and primitive mythology, then a promising new academic field, and wrote a number of scholarly books on such topics: The Vikings in Western Christendom (1890) stood as a standard work for many decades. He also became expert on Norway and the Norwegians, and knew many poets and writers there. Keary worked from 1872 to 1887 at the Department of Coins at The British Museum in London, where he wrote and published A Catalogue Of English Coins In The British Museum: Anglo-Saxon Series (1887) with Herbert Appold Grueber, and contributed scholarly articles on coins to numismatic journals. Keary was awarded the Medal of the Royal Numismatic Society in 1894. During his time at the British Museum he was the best friend of Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, the Anglo-Irish philosopher. ==Literature== Keary then turned from coins and history to writing ambitious literary novels, influenced by the Russian novelists of the time. These works were rather unusual, using a lack of conventional structure in an attempt to suggest the chaos of reality, allied to close observation and a dispassionate approach to character. His novel The Two Lancrofts (1893) follows literary life from Oxford University to the Paris of Balzac and Zola.XIX Century Fiction, Part I, A‚ÄìK. Jarndyce, Bloomsbury, 2019. Herbert Vanlennart (1896) was based on his tour of India, which he had written up in the short travel book India: Impressions (1903). His later novel Bloomsbury (1905) drew on his experience of moving amid the \\"curious neurotic intellectualism\\" (The Spectator review, 8 April 1905) of London literary circles in the Bloomsbury of the late 1880s and early 1890s. At that time, under the pseudonym H. Ogram Matuce, he had published a radically impressionistic prose work, The Wanderer: From the papers of the late H. Ogram Matuce (1888). In a 4 September 1909 Spectator review of his later novel The Mount, it is remembered that \\"for some of us the publication of Mr. C. F. Keary's The Wanderer over twenty years ago was an event.\\" Keary tried the then-fashionable form of verse drama, with \\"The Brothers: a Fairy Masque\\" (1902) and \\"Rigel: a Mystery\\" (1904), and moved with more success into philosophy with The Pursuit of Reason (Cambridge University Press, 1910). After his untimely death, from a heart attack in London on 26 October 1917, one further book appeared: The Posthumous Poems of C. F. Keary (1923). However, the timing of his death, amid the full clamour of World War One, hastened his rapid slide into almost total obscurity. His collection of short works with weird and horrific elements, Twixt Dog and Wolf (1901), is known to have influenced James Joyce's novel Dubliners (1905) ‚Äì as evinced in a letter from Joyce dated 24 September 1905 (Letters of James Joyce, Vol. 2, p. 111). Twixt Dog and Wolf was described by fantasy historian Douglas A. Anderson as containing \\"literary weird fiction of a high order.\\"Douglas A. Anderson, Late Reviews.Nodens Books, Marcellus, MI, 2018, p. 89. ==Music== Keary also wrote the libretto for the opera Koanga (1904) by the composer Frederick Delius, with whom he had detailed discussions. But the collaboration was short and fraught, and led to no further work with Delius.John White, \\"The Literary Sources of the Delius Operas\\", Delius Society Journal, Summer 2004, pp. 16‚Äì18. Keary's sister was the Staffordshire folklorist and folk-song collector Miss Alice Annie Keary, close friend of the major folklorist Charlotte Sophia Burne. Keary himself travelled in Europe and dabbled there in folk-song collecting, publishing articles such as \\"Roumanian Peasants and their Songs\\". ==Selected works== * The dawn of history, 1878 * The mythology of the Eddas, 1880 * Outlines of primitive belief among the Indo-European races, 1882 * The morphology of coins, 1886 * The vikings in western Christendom, A.D. 789 to A.D. 888, 1891 * Norway and the Norwegians, 1892 * The two Lancrofts, 1893 * Herbert Vanlennert, 1895 * The journalist, 1898 * The pursuit of reason, 1910 ==ReferencesSources== * * * Category:1848 births Category:1917 deaths Category:Decadent literature Category:Victorian novelists Category:19th-century British novelists Category:20th-century British novelists Category:Employees of the British Museum Category:English horror writers Category:Weird fiction writers Category:English opera librettists Category:19th-century male writers Category:20th-century British male writers Category:British male novelists ","title":"Charles Francis Keary"},{"id":"41963328","text":"The University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy and Practice, commonly known as Penn SP2, is a school of social policy and social work in the United States whose vision is \\"The passionate pursuit of social innovation, impact and justice.\\" Originally named the School of Social Work, the school was founded in 1908 and is a graduate school of the University of Pennsylvania.

The bus had been parked, waiting to cross into Israel at the Taba Border Crossing, when a lone suicide bomber entered the open bus and detonated his explosives. Four people - three South Koreans and the Egyptian bus driver were killed, and 17 others injured. The attack was seen as marking a potential shift in the strategy of jihadist groups in the Sinai insurgency by broadening their campaign against Egyptian security forces to include tourists. ==Victims== The bomber detonated his device on a tour bus carrying more than 30 members of a South Korean church group. They had traveled from Cairo to Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula. The bus was waiting to cross into Israel when the explosion occurred. The South Korean tourists belonged to the Jincheon Jungang Presbyterian Church. They had reportedly \\"saved for years to visit Biblical sites on the 60th anniversary of their church\\". ==Responsibility== The day following the bombing, the Sinai- based jihadist group Ansar Bait al-Maqdis claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement released on jihadist forums. In the statement, Ansar declared, \\"One of the heroes of Ansar Beit al-Maqdis carried out the attack on a tourist bus heading towards the Zionist entity (Israel).\\" The group said the attack was \\"part of our economic war against this regime of traitors ... which kills the innocent, destroys houses, ransacks properties and lays waste to land on the border with the Zionist enemy\\". On February 18, an affiliated Twitter account of Ansar told tourists to leave Egypt by February 20 or else they would be attacked.

Bligh was educated at Winchester School and Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1940. == Career == During the Second World War, Bligh served in the Royal Navy in the North Atlantic, the English Channel and the Mediterranean, and was twice wounded. He was awarded the DSC and bar and the DSO, and was appointed an OBE. Bligh joined the Civil Service in 1946 as an Assistant Principal in the Treasury, and was rapidly promoted, reaching the rank of Under-Secretary in 1959. That year he was appointed Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, whom he served until the latter's resignation in October 1963. Bligh then served Macmillan's successor, Sir Alec Douglas-Home in the same capacity, until Home's defeat in the 1964 British general election. In 1964 Bligh left the government's service to become a director of the media chain the Thomson Organisation, and became its Assistant Managing Director in 1966. He was briefly active in Conservative politics, as an alderman on the Greater London Council from 1967. Bligh died at his home on 12 March 1969, after a long illness. == Profumo affair == As the prime minister's Principal Private secretary Bligh was peripherally involved in the Profumo affair of 1963, a scandal which brought about the resignation of John Profumo as Secretary of State for War and destabilised the government. Before the affair broke, Bligh had been advised of the possibility that Profumo had compromised national security through a sexual affair with a 19-year-old showgirl, Christine Keeler, who was a known associate of the society osteopath Stephen Ward, a suspected Soviet sympathiser. Bligh interviewed Profumo, who denied any wrongdoing but asked if he should resign to avoid embarrassing the government. He was advised that he should not.Davenport-Hines, p. 267 Later, when the affair was unravelling, Bligh met Ward, who by then, at the Home Office's instigation, was under police investigation regarding possible vice charges. Ward asked Bligh if there was anything that could be done to halt the investigation, which was proving ruinous to his practice. Bligh took no action.Davenport-Hines, pp. 287‚Äì88 In June 1963 when the scandal reached its climax, Macmillan being absent in Scotland it was to Bligh that Profumo first confessed his guilt, and it was Bligh who transmitted the contents of Profumo's resignation letter to the prime minister.Knightley and Kennedy, pp. 186‚Äì87 ==Private life== Bligh married Ruth Pamela Robertson in 1945; there were two sons and one daughter from the marriage.

This marked the country's first entry into the Winter Paralympic Games. Brazil sent two athletes, snowboarder Andre Pereira in Alpine skiing and Fernando Rocha in cross-country skiing. The country's best performance in any event was 15th, achieved by Rocha in the 15 km sitting competition. ==Background== Brazil has competed in every Summer Paralympics since making their debut at the 1972 Summer Paralympics in Heidelberg, Germany. The nation made its first appearance in a Winter Olympic Games in the 1992 Albertville Games, and has participated in every Winter Olympics since, as of the conclusion of the 2018 Winter Olympics. However, the 2014 Winter Paralympics was the nation's first appearance in the winter version of the Paralympics. Andre Pereira was chosen as the Brazilian flag- bearer for the parade of nations during the opening ceremony. Fernando Rocha was chosen as the flag-bearer for the closing ceremony. ==Disability classification== Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Events with \\"B\\" in the code are for athletes with visual impairment, codes LW1 to LW9 are for athletes who stand to compete and LW10 to LW12 are for athletes who compete sitting down. Alpine skiing and cross-country skiing events grouped athletes into separate competitions for sitting, standing and visually impaired athletes. == Alpine skiing == For the 2014 Winter Paralympics, snowboard cross was considered a discipline of Alpine skiing, rather than a separate sport. Snowboarding was offered only for athletes who competed in a standing position. The men's snowboard cross event was held on 14 March 2014. Andre Pereira was 34 years old at the time of the competition. Over three runs, Pereira improved his time on each run. Only the two best runs for each rider counted, and his combined time was 2 minutes and 42 seconds, placing him 28th out of 33 competitors. The race was won by Evan Strong with a combined time of 1 minute and 43 seconds. ===Men=== { style=\\"font-size:90%\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Athlete !rowspan=\\"2\\"Event !colspan=2Race 1 !colspan=2Race 2 !colspan=2Race 3 !colspan=2Total - style=\\"font-size:95%\\" !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Rank -align=center align=leftAndre Pereira align=leftSnowboard cross 1:37.17 30 1:23.09 27 1:18.98 26 2:42.07 28 } ==Cross-country skiing== Fernando Rocha was 35 at the time of the Games. He competes in cross-country skiing from a sitting position. He was classified as LW11.5, and as such, his final times were only 97% of his real times. Athletes classified as LW12 had their full times counted, whereas athletes classified LW11 had 94% of their times count. Athletes classified LW10 had only 86% of their times count. On 9 March 2014, he competed in the 15 km sitting competition, and finished with an adjusted time of 49 minutes and 31 seconds, placing him 15th out of 21 competitors, and over 8 minutes behind the winning time of 40 minutes and 51 seconds. Three days later, on 12 March, he participated in the qualification round of the 1km sprint sitting. He finished with an adjusted time of 2 minutes, 29 seconds, good for 20th place, however, only the top 12 were allowed to advance to the semi-finals. The slowest qualifying adjusted time was 2 minutes and 20.12 seconds. His final event was on 16 March, the 10 km sitting competition. He finished with an adjusted time of 35 minutes and 37 seconds; good for 21st place out of 26 competitors who finished the race‚Äîtwo competitors did not finish.

Kodak Imaging Network, Inc., 840 F. Supp. 2d 724 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3, 2012), was a United States district court case in which the visual artist Sheila Wolk brought suit against Kodak Imaging Network, Inc., Eastman Kodak Company, and Photobucket.com, Inc. for copyright infringement. Users uploaded Wolk's work to Photobucket, a user-generated content provider, which had a revenue sharing agreement with Kodak that permitted users to use Kodak Gallery to commercially print (photofinish) images from Photobucket's site‚Äîincluding unauthorized copies of Wolk's artwork. The court held that Kodak was not liable for direct copyright infringement because its photofinishing system relied on an automated process, and liability requires volitional conduct beyond \\"mere ownership of a machine used by others to make illegal copies.\\" The court also held that Photobucket was protected under the safe-harbor provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). This case is one of the few to analyze the forms of injunctive relief available to plaintiffs suing online service providers protected from copyright liability by DMCA safe-harbor provisions. == Facts == Prior to filing suit, Wolk sent fifteen takedown notices to Photobucket relating to nine of Wolk's works which Photobucket users had uploaded. Eleven of these notices did not comply with ¬ß 512(c)(3) of the DMCA () because they neglected to include the URLs for the infringing posts. Photobucket promptly removed the infringing content in response to all of Wolk's DMCA-compliant notices and some of her non-compliant notices. However, Wolk also wanted Photobucket to proactively remove future posts containing the material she identified without the need for her to send additional notices. Photobucket's agreement with Kodak relied on an automated system which transferred images from the Photobucket website to the Kodak Gallery, where \\"prints and other items incorporating the photographs\\" would be available for purchase from Kodak. Wolk described ten incidents in which Kodak \\"allegedly made, sold and shipped products using Wolk's copyrighted images without obtaining Wolk's permission or a valid license.\\" == Court opinion  Preliminary injunction === Wolk moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent Photobucket from infringing her copyrights. To obtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff must prove either \\"a likelihood of success on the merits\\" or \\"irreparable harm, that the balance of hardships falls in her favor, or that public policy supports her sought-after relief.\\" The court held that Wolk's claims were unlikely to succeed on the merits because Photobucket qualified for safe-harbor protections under the DMCA. Specifically, Photobucket qualified for the safe-harbor protections of because (1) Photobucket fell within the statutory definition of \\"service provider,\\" (2) it implemented a policy to deal with repeat infringers, (3) it did not interfere with \\"standard technical measures,\\" and (4) under the circumstances of this case, it met the requirements for protection. Wolk argued that her notices to Photobucket identifying specific instances of infringement also served as notices of present and future infringement, effectively requiring Photobucket to police its site for user activity that infringes Wolk's copyrights. The court held that the DMCA imposes no such obligation on service providers. Because Photobucket qualified for DMCA safe-harbor protections, the injunctive relief available to Wolk was limited to the three types enumerated in : an order restraining the provider from providing access to the infringing material or activity, an order restraining access to an account engaging in infringing activity, or other relief that the court deems necessary to prevent specific instances of infringement. The court held that this section provided no relief to Wolk because Photobucket had already complied with all of her takedown notices. The court also found that Wolk failed to demonstrate irreparable harm, that the balance of hardships weighed in her favor, or that the injunction would serve the public interest. Because she failed to prove the elements necessary to obtain a preliminary injunction, the court denied Wolk's motion. === Summary judgment === On May 2, 2011, Wolk moved for summary judgment against Photobucket and Kodak. In response, both Photobucket and Kodak filed cross-motions for summary judgment against Wolk. The court denied Wolk's motions and granted the motions of Photobucket and Kodak. Courts will grant summary judgment if the evidence shows \\"that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\\" Courts ask \\"whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\\"  Kodak  In her motion for summary judgment against Kodak, Wolk argued that Kodak directly infringed her copyrights by copying her images and printing them on products for its customers. She argued that she was entitled to statutory damages of up to $150,000 for each instance of infringement because Kodak \\"wilfully infringed\\" her copyrights. To prevail on a claim of direct infringement, a plaintiff must prove that the defendant engaged in \\"volitional conduct\\" that caused the infringement. Here, the court held that \\"there is no evidence of volitional conduct, thereby preventing Wolk from establishing direct liability.\\" Kodak fulfilled orders from Photobucket through an automatic computer system without any human intervention. Since the process was entirely automated, Kodak lacked the volition necessary to hold it liable for direct infringement. Since Kodak could not be held liable for direct infringement, the court did not reach the questions of whether Kodak qualified for DMCA safe harbors, whether its infringement was \\"willful\\", or whether Wolk was entitled to statutory damages for each work of art infringed.  Photobucket  In her motion for summary judgment against Photobucket, Wolk argued that Photobucket was liable for direct, contributory, and vicarious copyright infringement. First, the court held that Photobucket was entitled to safe-harbor protections under the DMCA. It found that Photobucket satisfied the three threshold requirements for safe-harbor protections: (1) it was a \\"service provider\\" within the statutory definition, (2) it adopted and reasonably implemented a policy to block repeat infringers, and (3) it accommodated and did not interfere with \\"standard technical measures.\\" The court also found that Photobucket met the requirements for protection under , which creates a safe harbor for service providers that host \\"[i]nformation residing on systems or networks at [the] direction of users.\\" The court addressed five points in its analysis of Photobucket's safe harbor under : # Actual knowledge of the infringing activity: Wolk argued that her takedown notices imposed a duty on Photobucket to remove all present and future instances of infringement of the works she listed. The court disagreed, holding that Photobucket was only required to remove the instances of infringing material that Wolk specifically identified in DMCA-compliant notices. # \\"Right and ability to control\\" and \\"financial benefit\\": Photobucket did not have the \\"right and ability to control\\" user- generated content because it did not prescreen user submissions before publishing them. In addition, Photobucket did not receive a financial benefit specifically from the infringing activity; rather, it profited by providing its services in general. # Removal of infringing material: Photobucket promptly removed infringing material when it received takedown notices. # Designated agent: Photobucket properly designated an agent to receive takedown notices as the DMCA requires. # Duty to police: Photobucket did not have a duty to monitor its service for evidence of infringing activity. The court concluded that \\"Photobucket is able to take advantage of the 'safe harbor' provision under .\\" Thus Photobucket was not liable for direct copyright infringement. Wolk also argued that Photobucket was secondarily liable for contributory and vicarious copyright infringement. The court held that the safe harbor under protected Photobucket from these claims. Even without the safe harbor protections, however, the court noted that Wolk's claims for secondary liability would fail. == Commentary == Eric Goldman wrote that \\"this is the most detailed judicial discussion of 512(j) to date\\", offering a substantial interpretation of the DMCA's injunctive provisions. He also wrote that this case establishes \\"useful boundary-setting for service providers\\" in future scenarios when those providers might find themselves faced with \\"copyright owners who want turnkey never-infringe-my-stuff-again services.\\" Martin Schwimmer of \\"The Trademark Blog\\" pointed out that Photobucket may not have pre-screening methods in place to police infringement, but larger companies like eBay do have this technology. He also commented that \\"it will continue to be cheaper and more effective to place intermediaries on actual notice than to bring 'constructive' notice/they shoulda known' litigations.\\" Thomas Yohannan of the California Western School of Law wrote that this case is \\"a reminder that the responsibility of finding infringing works is up to the copyright holder, not the website. A website that complies with the DMCA safe harbors is responsible for removing UGC (user-generated content) only if the copyright holder notifies them of the specific illegal content at that moment (a 512(c)(3) takedown notice). It's not responsible for future occurrences.\\" Joe Mullin of GigaOm wrote that \\"the fact that Photobucket was found to easily fit into the 'safe harbor' provided by the DMCA suggests that the path for internet companies to stay safe from copyright allegations is getting clearer in the wake of recent major decisions, such as the YouTube case.\\" === Photofinishing liability === Photofinishing is the business or process of printing photographs from film negatives or digital images. This case, which released Kodak from liability associated with photofinishing, marks a possible departure from earlier cases holding photofinishers liable for creating unauthorized prints of copyrighted works. For instance, In 1999, the Professional Photographers of America sued Kmart, seeking $600,000 in damages and an injunction to prevent Kmart from violating copyright law by printing copyright protected images for their customers. Retailers have sought to avoid liability by refusing to print high-quality images without written releases from photographers. In this case, the court established that the transmission of images from Photobucket to the Kodak Gallery did \\"not constitute a volitional act\\" because it was the result of an automated process. Eric Goldman commented that \\"Kodak's system was completely automated only because Kodak's engineers designed it that way,\\", and that \\"a richer theoretical grounding for the volitional doctrine and how it interplays with strict liability\\" could add clarity to this result. Goldman added that \\"this ruling has to be encouraging for other automated photofinishers (whether they print photos or other items), such as CafePress or Zazzle.\\" == See also == * IO Group, Inc. v.

The iron concentration is 5.3 milligrams per liter and of iron flows through the stream each day. The concentration of manganese is 11.81 milligrams per liter and the daily load of manganese is . The acidity concentration is 73 milligrams per liter and the alkalinity concentration is 0.83 milligrams per liter. The daily loads of these are and , respectively. To meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's maximum allowable load requirements, the acidity load would need to be reduced by 99.5%. The total daily load of acid mine drainage in the watershed is per day. The concentration of sulfates at the stream's headwaters is 5.8 milligrams per liter, but at the mouth the concentration is 67 milligrams per liter. The concentration of sulfates at the mouth of the tributary Stony Run is 271 milligrams per liter. As is typical for streams that begin in a bog, Drury Run's the first , near Tamarack Swamp, of the stream are stained brown from tannin in the stream. The presence of tannin causes the waters in the upper part of the stream to be weakly acidic. There is a high concentration of dissolved organic compounds in the stream. Drury Run experiences acid mine drainage, mostly in the final . The tributary Stony Run is the most affected by acid mine drainage of all the tributaries of the stream. In 1990, the discharge of Drury Run upstream of Sandy Run's confluence with it ranged from 1500 to 3700 gallons per minute. ==Watershed and geology== The watershed of Drury Run is located in Clinton County. It is 11.5 square miles in area. The watershed is underlain by Pennsylvanian age sedimentary rocks of the Pottsville and Allegheny Formations. The Clarion, Lower Kittanning, and Mercer coals are all found in the watershed. A number of abandoned mines are located in the southern part of the watershed. The watershed is mostly forested. ==History== A dam was built on Drury Run in the 1800s and was replaced shortly before 1911. The first school in the community of Renovo was built at the mouth of the stream in 1864. In 1915, the population of the Drury Run watershed was 47. Around this time, the stream, along with Paddy's Run, was suspected of being the source of a typhoid fever outbreak, but it was determined that the streams were not the source of the outbreak. Until at least 1915, the Renovo Water Company used the stream as its water supply. Coal mining and clay mining has been done in the watersheds of all four of the named tributaries of Drury Run. Underground mining of coal and clay in the Drury Run watershed began in the late 1800s and went on until 1940. Surface mining in the watershed was done between the 1940s and the 1980s. ==Biology== Drury Run is a high-quality trout stream from its source at Tamarack Swamp to the mouth of Woodley Draft. Downstream of Woodley Draft, it still supports fish, but is also impaired by acid mine drainage. Brook trout and brown trout live and reproduce in the reaches of the stream that are relatively unaffected by acid mine drainage, but there are no fish in reaches that are significantly affected by mine drainage. Creek chub and eastern blacknose dace also live in the stream. The tributary Stony Run is completely devoid of fish. Upstream from acid mine inflows, Drury Creek and its tributaries have healthy macroinvertebrate communities. They exhibit high species diversity, with mayflies (an acid-intolerant group) making up more than 40 percent of the macroinvertebrate population. Below the mouth of Sandy Run, the population of mayflies on Drury Run decreases significantly, with acid-resistant stoneflies the most significant macroinvertebrates in the stream. Downstream of Woodley Draft and Whiskey Run, there is less macroinvertebrate diversity in Drury Run, with mayflies making up 2% of the macroinvertebrates. At the mouth the mayfly population makes up under 1% of the macroinvertebrates. Sandy Run is the only tributary with a mayfly population. ==See also== *Young Womans Creek, next major tributary downstream *Kettle Creek (Pennsylvania), next major tributary upstream *List of rivers of Pennsylvania ==References== Category:Tributaries of the West Branch Susquehanna River Category:Rivers of Clinton County, Pennsylvania Category:Rivers of Pennsylvania ","title":"Drury Run"},{"id":"41963553","text":"Counter Culture Coffee is a Durham, North Carolina based coffee roasting company founded in 1995.

Cinema in Kazakhstan can be traced back to the early 20th century. Today, Kazakhstan produces approximately fifteen full-length films each year. ==History1930s-1980s: the Soviet period=== The film industry in Kazakhstan has its origins in the production of documentaries in Alma-Ata (now Almaty) in the 1930s, developed to use as instruments for Soviet propaganda. The first Kazakh feature film, Amangeldy (1939), about the leader of the 1916 revolution, Amangeldy Imanov, was however the work of Lenfilm in Leningrad. Filmmaking in Kazakhstan was given a boost by the dislocations caused by World War II, as the main Soviet film studios, Mosfilm and Lenfilm, were both evacuated to Alma-Ata, where they combined with the Alma-Ata Film Studios to produce the Central United Film Studio. As a result, the Central United Film Studio, which continued working in Alma-Ata till 1944, produced 80 percent of all Soviet domestic feature films made during the war. Much of the great Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein's two part epic Ivan the Terrible was filmed in the Kazakh SSR.Perrie, Maureen. The Cult of Ivan the Terrible in Stalin's Russia (Studies in Russian and Eastern European History and Society) . New York: Palgrave, 2001 (hardcopy, ). One of the major Soviet film schools, the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography (VGIK), was also temporarily relocated to Alma-Ata during the war. This film school became an alma-mater for the most notable Kazakh filmmakers of the 1980s, known as \\"the new wave\\". On January 6, 1961, the major Kazakh film company Alma-Ata Film Studios had its name changed to Kazakhfilm by the Ministry of the Culture of the Kazakh SSR. In the post-war Soviet period, the major figure of Kazakh SSR's film industry was director Shaken Aimanov, in whose honor the Kazakhfilm film studios were renamed in 1984. Notable films of this period include a number of historical epics, such as the love tragic story Kyz-Zhibek (1970), and a trio of action films involving a secret agent, played by Asanali Ashimov, who uses all manner of derring-do to defeat the enemies of communism. The first in the trilogy, The End of the Ataman (1970), was set in 1921 and was directed by Shaken Aimanov. The second, The Trans-Siberian Express (1977), directed by Yeldar Orazbayev and set in 1927, featured a complicated plot involving the defeat of counter- revolutionaries planning to kill a Japanese businessman on a train bound for Moscow, on which our hero was masquerading as a cabaret manager. The third, The Manchurian Variant (1989), was set in 1945 Manchuria. The films, with their central hero played by a Kazakh actor, were, as well as entertainment, part of the efforts of the Soviet establishment to demonstrate that the Kazakh people fully supported communism. ===Late 1980s-early 1990s: Kazakh New Wave=== During the perestroika in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, a new wave of young Kazakh filmmakers emerged, ready to challenge the cinematic establishment. Released in 1988, The Needle provided a catalyst for this new movement in Kazakh film. The film, directed by Rashid Nugmanov, cast Viktor Tsoi as the central figure. Tsoi was the frontman of the popular Soviet rock group Kino, and considered by many to be a hero to the disaffected Soviet youth. Kino also composed the film's original soundtrack. Tsoi's character, Moro, returns to Alma-Ata to collect a debt from a lowly criminal, only to find out that his former girlfriend has become a drug addict. He decides to fight against the drug dealers, after which the film ends with him being stabbed in a snowy park at night. Another important founding work of the movement is Ermek Shinarbaev's 1989 film Revenge (–ú–µ—Å—Ç—å), which tackles on film for the first time the tragedies experienced by the Korean population in Kazakhstan and Central Asia. ===1990s-2000s: post-independence Kazakhstan=== Timur Bekmambetov is the first Kazakh director who had success in Hollywood. In 1993, Nugmanov directed The Wild East, loosely based on Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, involves a group of dwarves, runaways from the circus, who brings the magnificent seven to protects them from the predations of motorbike-riding Mongolian hoodlums. Nugmanov moved to Paris in 1993, where he has been associated with Kazakh political opposition groups. Other filmmakers of the post-independence Kazakhstan to have achieved success at international festivals include Satybaldy Narimbetov. His Biography of a Young Accordion Player (1994) is a tale of a small boy growing up in a Kazakh village during World War II. Leila's Prayer (2002) focuses on girl from a village close to the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, whose mother prayer is that her baby son should live to old age. Darezhan Omirbaev's Killer (1998), a Kazakh-French co- production, is a tragic tale highlighting the economic difficulties by Kazakhstanis in the 1990s. A young driver from Almaty causes a minor motor accident when taking his wife and newborn baby back home from the hospital. Unable to pay for the damage, he gets sucked into crime. Amir Karakulov has garnered critical praise for a number of films, including Homewrecker (1991), a tale of two brothers in love with the same girl. Again, it all ends badly. A new arrival on the scene is Rustem Abdrashev. His directorial debut was Renaissance Island (2004), a tale of the first love of an aspiring poet set against the historical backdrop of the desiccation of the Aral Sea. One problem is that very few of these films have been widely seen by audiences in Kazakhstan. Domestic distributors have preferred to rely a diet of dubbed Hollywood blockbusters and big-budget Russian movies, with the result that post-independence Kazakh cinema has developed something of a reputation a being more likely to be found in Western art houses and international competitions than on screens in Kazakhstan. However, the big-budget Kazakhstan film has arrived. Nomad: The Warriors (2005), with its international crew and cast, was an officially supported attempt to bring a film based on an exploits of Kazakh warriors of the 18th century onto international screens. Racketeer (2007), directed by Akan Satayev, about as a young Almaty in the tough economic climate of the 1990s, was billed as the first purely commercially oriented film made in the post-independence Kazakhstan, and proved a considerable box-office draw. One Kazakh director, Timur Bekmambetov, has also had success internationally in commercials cinema projects, particularly with the Russian fantasy features Night Watch (2004) and Day Watch (2006). Bekmambetov is now directing and producing movies in Hollywood. His notable works made in Hollywood includes Wanted (2008), The Darkest Hour (2011) and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (2012). A guerrilla filmmaking movement called Partisan Cinema (Partizanskoe kino) was initiated in the 2010s. Participating directors aim to work without any interference from the Kazakh government. The movement's manifesto has three pillars: no budget, social realism and finding new ways.The Partisan Movement, or Kazakhstan's New Wave Cinema by Eduardo Guillot Films and directors in the movement include: * Toll Bar (Shlagbaum, 2015) by Zhassulan Poshanov * The Plague at the Karatas Village (Chuma v aule Karatas, 2016) by Adilkhan Yerzhanov * Witness of Case No 6 (Svidetel' dela No 6, 2016) by Serik Abishev ==Cinemas== Lokomotiv Cinema in Aktobe was built in 1928 during the Soviet period. Cinemas in Kazakhstan range from draughty Soviet survivals to modern multiplex complexes. The market of cinemas is divided between the KinoPark Multiplex Cinemas, StarCinema, Arman and smaller players. Kazakhstan's new cinemas are usually located in shopping malls and entertainment centers. Ticket prices are lower than those in Western Europe and North America. In 2012, IMAX Corp. opened those two cinemas in Kazakhstan, as the result of the deal signed with KinoPark Multiplex Cinemas in 2010. Films originally made in English are almost invariably dubbed, not subtitled, but there is a little shown in English. ==Festivals== Red Carpet at the International Astana Action Film Festival in 2012. *International Astana Action Film Festival *Shaken's Stars *Eurasia International Film Festival ==Film schools== *Kazakh National Academy of Arts *Kazakh National University of Arts ==Film productionFilm studios=== Kazakhfilm Studio is a state- owned company, financed by the Ministry of Culture, which has been in Kazakhstan since Soviet Union times.

Ambler was the first scientist to publish an amino acid sequence of a bacterial protein, and had a long academic career at the University of Edinburgh. ==Early life and education== Ambler was born on 26 May 1933 in Bexleyheath, London to Anne Evans, a civil servant, and Henry Ambler, a state-employed chemist. In 1940, the family moved to Pune, India, where Ambler's father conducted wartime explosives research. Ambler later returned to England to attend boarding school at Haileybury, before heading to Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1954 to study natural sciences. He remained at Cambridge to complete his PhD on bacterial proteins, under the tutelage of the Nobel Prize-winning scientist Fred Sanger. In 1963, Ambler published the first amino acid sequence of a bacterial protein, developing new methods of protein sequencing to determine the structure of the mitochondrial cytochrome c protein. Cytochrome c remains an important object of study for modern biologists. ==Academic career and bacterial research== In 1965, Ambler joined the newly created Department of Molecular Biology at the University of Edinburgh. He began a longstanding research project on the increasing resistance of certain bacteria to penicillin and other antibiotics, making important discoveries related to bacterial gene transfer and enzyme development. In particular, Ambler found that horizontal gene transfer played a key role in the development of antibiotic resistance. He headed the Department of Molecular Biology between 1984 and 1990, helping to reorganize it into more specialized sub-departments, and became a member of the European Molecular Biology Organisation in 1985. He retired from the University of Edinburgh in the mid-1990s, and died in Edinburgh in December 2013. ==Personal life== Ambler was married twice, first to roboticist Pat Waddington and later to Susan Hewlett. He was survived by two daughters, four step-daughters and seven grandchildren. He had a keen interest in archeology, and was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. ==References *University of Edinburgh obituary of Ambler Category:1933 births Category:2013 deaths Category:English molecular biologists Category:English medical researchers Category:Members of the European Molecular Biology Organization Category:Alumni of Pembroke College, Cambridge Category:Academics of the University of Edinburgh ","title":"Richard Ambler"},{"id":"41963869","text":"Hugo Mark Gerbermann, M.M.

As inmates became more angry and belligerent they defied an attempt to lock down the facility, then 400 to 500 prisoners started breaking windows, throwing rocks, and setting fires. By the time order was restored one inmate was dead from a bullet wound, two correctional officers had been injured, and $3 million in damage had been done.On the Other Side of the Bars: Lessons Learned As a Prison Warden/Administrator, by Dan M.

He is a two-time Rolex Sports Car Series GT class champion and winner of the 2014 24 Hours of Daytona in GT Daytona. ==Ferrari Challenge== Segal became the youngest race winner in Ferrari Challenge history at the age of 17. He competed in multiple events prior to becoming a driver coach for a number of teams. ==Rolex Sports Car Series== In 2003, Segal made his series debut, finishing third in the GT class at Virginia International Raceway driving a Ferrari of Washington Ferrari 360 GT. After making select starts from 2004‚Äì07, Segal stepped up to full-time competition in 2008, claiming the GT class pole and win in the Sahlen's Six Hours of The Glen in a SpeedSource Mazda RX-8. He scored seven top-10 finishes that year. The 2009 season saw continued success, with wins at Watkins Glen and Miller Motorsports Park and one additional podium finish. In 2010, Segal won the GT Championship with two wins and ten consecutive top-four finishes, as well as a pole position at the Rolex 24 at Daytona. He shared the title with co-driver Emil Assentato in the No. 69 AIM Autosport Mazda RX-8. Segal finished fifth in the GT points standings in 2011, scoring eleven top-10 finishes in the SpeedSource Mazda. Segal earned his second GT Championship in three years, teaming again with Assentato for three class wins in AIM Autosport's Ferrari 458 Italia Grand Am for the 2012 title. He finished sixth in the GT standings in 2013, which included a class victory at Indianapolis. ==Continental Tire SportsCar Challenge== Segal joined Automatic Racing for two GS races in 2005, prior to an eighth-place finish in the GS points the following year, with three podiums in nine races and a best finish of second.

It can be considered the higher-dimensional analogue of the 4-dimensional icosahedral 120-cell and the 3-dimensional great dodecahedron. It is related to the order-5 icosahedral 120-cell honeycomb and great 120-cell honeycomb: the icosahedral 120-cells and great 120-cells in each honeycomb are replaced by the 600-cells that are their convex hulls, thus forming the pentagrammic-order 600-cell honeycomb. This honeycomb can also be constructed by taking the order-5 5-cell honeycomb and replacing clusters of 600 5-cells meeting at a vertex with 600-cells. Each 5-cell belongs to five such clusters, and thus the pentagrammic-order 600-cell honeycomb has density 5. == See also == * List of regular polytopes == References == *Coxeter, Regular Polytopes, 3rd. ed., Dover Publications, 1973. .

In the years that followed the discovery of X-rays, Jerman was one of the first people to focus on the details that created quality X-ray images, such as exposure and positioning. He served as an examiner during the initial efforts to license personnel who took X-rays. He has been referred to as \\"the father of radiography\\". ==Biography== Jerman was born on November 21, 1865 in Ripley County, Indiana. He was the son of a physician. As a child, he became interested in the study of the batteries that powered his father's medical equipment. He attended Franklin College in Indiana, but experienced health problems in his last year and was unable to finish his studies. Jerman went to work for the Physicians & Surgeons Supply Company in Cincinnati, a medical device company. He became the shop foreman there and then created the Jerman Electric Company. As part of his new enterprise, Jerman manufactured a power source for other medical equipment known as a Jerman static machine. His device was the only one available that was large enough to create X-rays. When Jerman created his first X-ray image, he created an image of his own hand. He described taping his hand down with electrical tape and exposing the hand to the radiation for 30 minutes. He worked closely with Victor Electric Company in the manufacture of his machines. Suffering from health issues again, Jerman left Cincinnati for Topeka, Kansas, in search of a more suitable climate. Jerman thought that insufficient attention had been paid to standardizing radiographic technique in the years since the discovery of X-ray. X-rays had been used largely for entertainment purposes in those early days and clinical techniques varied from provider to provider. He wrote that \\"the weakest link of the chain was technique, and the chain could be no stronger than its weakest link.\\" By 1916, he had begun offering courses in radiography to professionals. About two years later, Jerman became the head of the education division at Victor Electric Company. In that capacity, he established 12 divisions of the company that offered classes to healthcare providers. The courses lasted between five and seven days. The American Roentgen Ray Society (ARRS) made Jerman its president in 1920 and he served several terms, becoming president emeritus in 1930. Jerman wrote Modern X-ray Technic (1928), the first textbook of radiographic techniques. It was published for several editions. He was a founder of the American Association of Radiological Technicians (now the American Society of Radiologic Technologists). Jerman served as the examiner for the first 1,000 candidates for credentialing by the American Registry of X-Ray Technicians. Late in his life, Jerman became interested in the application of X-rays to fields like botany, zoology and paleontology. After retiring in 1934, Jerman died two years later. In his final months, he dealt with painful sequelae of frequent X-ray exposure. ==References *American Roentgen Ray Society *The American Registry of Radiologic Technologists Category:1865 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Radiographers ","title":"Eddy Jerman"},{"id":"41964194","text":"{  align=\\"right\\" style=\\"margin-left:10px\\" width=\\"280\\" !bgcolor=#e7dcc3 colspan=2Order-5 icosahedral 120-cell honeycomb - bgcolor=#ffffff align=center colspan=2(No image) - bgcolor=#e7dcc3TypeHyperbolic regular honeycomb - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Schl√§fli symbol{3,5,5/2,5} - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Coxeter diagram - bgcolor=#e7dcc34-faces50px {3,5,5/2} - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Cells30px {3,5} - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Faces30px {3} - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Face figure30px {5} - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Edge figure30px {5/2,5} - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Vertex figure50px {5,5/2,5} - bgcolor=#e7dcc3DualGreat 120-cell honeycomb - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Coxeter group4, [5,3,3,3] - bgcolor=#e7dcc3PropertiesRegular } In the geometry of hyperbolic 4-space, the order-5 icosahedral 120-cell honeycomb is one of four regular star-honeycombs.

The building is purported to be haunted, which the business uses in its promotional literature. Apart from being an inn, the building has also served as a tourist home and shop. ==HistoryOwnership=== Another view of the inn The land the inn was built on was previously owned by Reverend Alexander Dobbins, who subdivided a larger estate for the purpose of selling it. John F. McFarlane purchased the land and is stated to be the first recorded owner of the home. Portions of the house are said to be dated to the early 1800s and is claimed to have been built in 1810, but the exact date is unclear. McFarlane owned the home until his death in 1851, at which point it became the property of the Bank of Gettysburg. The house passed through the hands of several owners and one of the owners, the Black family, called it the \\"Sleepy Hollow Inn\\" with the hook that there were \\"135\\" bullet holes in the side of the home. The house was purchased by Loring and Jean Shultz in 1972 and after claiming to have experienced paranormal activity, the family utilized this in the promotion for the inn and conducts tours of the premise. ===Historical aspects=== The Farnsworth House Inn was also one of the stops of the Gettysburg Address campaign and was, during the Battle of Gettysburg, utilized as a makeshift hospital and resting place for some members of the Confederate army. ==Paranormal== A stone describing tour options at the inn The Shultz family claims that the inn has been haunted by as many as 16 spirits at one point in time and that each spirit has its own distinct personality and name. The identity of the ghosts range from an 8 year old boy named Jeremy to a former mid-wife nurse and several soldiers. Paranormal elements that have been reported are things such as the sound of heavy breathing, the smell of cheroot, and the sensation of the mid-wife \\"tucking\\" people into bed. The inn has several rooms that are supposed to be \\"hot spots\\" for specific spiritual activity for particular ghosts such as the \\"Sara Black Room\\", which is supposed to be one of the most active rooms and will have spirits that can be photographed from the street. ==References * Category:Reportedly haunted locations in Pennsylvania Category:American Civil War sites Category:Bed and breakfasts in Pennsylvania ","title":"The Farnsworth House Inn"},{"id":"41964288","text":"Percy Ikerd (May 4, 1890 - March 10, 1955) was an American production manager and an assistant director who was nominated during the 6th Academy Awards for the short lived Best Assistant Director categoryhttp://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1934 He was the production manager for several films including High Noon and Oklahoma!, which Oklahoma was released after his death. ==Selected filmography== *Oklahoma!

It was first observed by astronomers of the LINEAR program on 5 March 2000 and followed until 14 March 2000, by which time it had dimmed to apparent magnitude 20 and was 40¬∞ from the Moon. By 17 March 2000 it was only 4 degrees from a 90% waxing gibbous moon. It has never been listed on the Sentry Risk Table because none of the potential orbital solutions create a risk of impact in the next ~100 years. The asteroid safely passed Earth on 17‚Äì18 February 2014. Due to a then-poorly determined orbit, the asteroid may have been significantly further from Earth and dozens of degrees from where the telescope was pointed during the 2014 approach. == Observations == The 2014 approach was broadcast live (YouTube archive) on the Internet at 09:00 pm EST (02:00 UTC), 18 February 2014, by the Slooh community observatory. Slooh's observatory on Mount Teide in Spain's Canary Islands was iced over at the time, so images from the Slooh observatory in Dubai were used to attempt detection of the asteroid. At the time of the broadcast, no obvious image of the asteroid could be seen. Some viewers complained by Twitter that it was boring when the object was never shown in the images, while others said that \\"boring\\" was a good outcome for a pass-by. == Orbit == is an Aten-family asteroid, and as such is often near the glare of the Sun as the asteroid seldom travels outside Earth's orbit when the Earth is nearby. The orbit was poorly constrained in 2014 since the asteroid had an observation arc of only 9 days creating an orbital uncertainty of 7. Since the asteroid had not been observed since 14 March 2000, the uncertainty region had kept increasing. During the 2014 approach, 17 February 2014 was the first day that the nominal orbit had a solar elongation more than 90 degrees from the Sun making it easier to recover under a dark sky. Using the nominal orbit, the asteroid was expected to have an apparent magnitude of about 16 and pass from Earth. Closest approach (perigee-geocentrical) was around 00:15 UTC on 18 February plus or minus about 13 hours. Even with an observation arc of 9 days, it was known that the minimum possible close approach distance to Earth on 18 February 2014 was with a small chance that the asteroid would pass as far as from Earth. Due to the uncertainty region of the asteroid, the asteroid could have been 75 degrees from the nominal position in the sky on 18 February 2014. was recovered on 24 February 2017 at magnitude 21, extending the observation arc to 17 years. It is now known that passed from Earth on 17 February 2014. == Physical characteristics == With an absolute magnitude of 22.5, the asteroid's diameter is estimated around in diameter, for a range in albedo of 0.27 to 0.05 depending on whether the object is of stony or carbonaceous composition. For a standard albedo of 0.14, it translates to a mean-diameter of 110 meters. == See also == * List of asteroid close approaches to Earth in 2014 * List of asteroid close approaches to Earth * 2009 RR == References  External links == * List Of Aten Minor Planets (by designation), Minor Planet Center * * * # Category:Minor planet object articles (unnumbered) # * 20140217 20000305 ","title":"2000 EM26"},{"id":"41964318","text":"The 1934 Swissair Tuttlingen accident occurred on 27 July 1934 when a Swissair Curtiss AT-32C Condor II aircraft crashed near Tuttlingen, Germany while flying through a thunderstorm, killing all 12 people on board.

The accident aircraft in the background, behind Nelly Diener, who died in the crash ==Aircraft and occupants== The aircraft involved in the accident, registered CH-170, was a Curtiss AT-32C Condor II, a variant of the standard T-32 developed specifically for Swiss flag carrier Swissair, which was its only operator. CH-170 had entered service on 28 March 1934 and, by the time of the accident, had only been in service for four months. The cabin was configured with seating for up to 15 people. The aircraft's flight attendant, Nelly Diener, also known as the Engel der L√ºfte (\\"Angel of the Skies\\"), is notable for being Europe's first air stewardess. She had been working for Swissair since 1 May 1934. The other two crew members were the pilot, Armin M√ºhlematter, and the radio navigator, Hans Daschinger. On the fatal flight, there were nine passengers aboard. ==Accident== The aircraft departed Zurich for Berlin, with stopovers in Stuttgart and Leipzig. Shortly after crossing the Swiss-German border, the aircraft, cruising at an altitude of about 3,000 meters, encountered a thunderstorm, and while flying through it, the right wing eventually broke off. This resulted in an immediate loss of control and the aircraft plummeted into a forest near Tuttlingen, exploding into flames on impact. ==Investigation== Investigators found that oscillations in the wing had caused a stress fracture, the severity of which was exacerbated by the violent weather conditions in which the aircraft was flying. German investigators, however, determined that one fracture formed in the wing and engine mount structure due to defective construction and welding techniques in conjunction with the engine vibrations, while a second fracture resulted from the force of the turbulence in the storm. ==References== Category:1934 in Germany Category:1934 in Switzerland Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1934 Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by in-flight structural failure Category:Airliner accidents and incidents caused by weather 1934 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Germany ","title":"1934 Swissair Tuttlingen accident"},{"id":"41964350","text":"NGC 1501 from the 0.8m Schulman Telescope at the Mount Lemmon SkyCenter NGC 1501 is a complex planetary nebula located in the constellation of Camelopardalis, discovered in 1787 by William Herschel.

The hotel also housed the studio for the first radio station in East St. Louis; WIL broadcast from the studio from 1927 to 1935, when WTMV took over the studio. The Rotary club of East St Louis held their weekly noon meeting from 1927 for over 30 years. Rotarians were investors in the building as well. The hotel remained one of the city's most important until the 1950s, when large hotels became less popular nationally. In 1957, Southern Illinois University began renting office space in the building, as it had recently opened a satellite campus in East St. Louis; the university purchased the hotel outright in the 1970s. Since the university left the building in 2004, it has remained vacant. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 31, 2013. ==Architecture== The Widmer Engineering Company designed the hotel in the Classical Revival style. The Classical Revival style was both nationally popular in the 1920s and commonly used in hotels in the St. Louis area. The brick building is built around a concrete frame and features terra cotta facing on its front facade. The terra cotta facing marks the two outer bays of the taller central section of the building; terra cotta is also used surrounding the entrance, in multiple belt courses between stories, and in the building's cornice. The building's design is relatively plain and free of ornamentation; this both reflected the utilitarian focus of the engineering company and the cost-effective approach of the hotel's owners, who did not wish to pay for separate architectural and engineering firms. ==References== Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:East St. Louis, Illinois Category:Buildings and structures in St. Clair County, Illinois Category:National Register of Historic Places in St. Clair County, Illinois ","title":"Broadview Hotel (East St. Louis, Illinois)"},{"id":"41964568","text":"Caribe is the sixth station of the Medell√≠n Metro from north to south, serving line A, and is located in the northern part of the municipality of Medell√≠n.

Section 15 guarantees equality rights and the right to be free from discrimination on certain enumerated grounds. The analysis requires the claimant to prove that she or he has been discriminated against in comparison to another group identified by the claimant or by the Court. The appropriate comparator group was described by the Supreme Court of Canada as a group with whom \\"the claimant shares the characteristics relevant to qualification for the benefit or burden in question, except for the personal characteristic that is said to be the ground of wrongful discrimination.\\"Hodge v Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development), 2004 SCC 65. ==Background and origins== The 1989 case Andrews v. Law Society of British ColumbiaAndrews v Law Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 SCR 143. was the first Supreme Court of Canada judgment to articulate the framework for analysis of Charter equality claims. The Court formulated a test requiring that the claimant prove that differential treatment on a ground enumerated in section 15 or on an \\"analogous\\" ground had occurred and the treatment had caused harm or stereotyping. The Court described equality as a comparative concept, stating that the condition of discrimination \\"may only be attained or discerned by comparison with the condition of others in the social and political setting in which the question arises.\\" Ten years later, the Supreme Court expanded on the section 15 equality analysis in Law v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration),Law v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) [1999] 1 SCR 497. stating that identification of a comparator group was necessary to determine whether the claimant had experienced discrimination. The Court is not bound by the group chosen by the claimant but can redefine the group based on \\"biological, historical, and sociological similarities or dissimilarities\\" between the claimant and others. The Supreme Court maintained in later cases that the identification of a comparator group was crucial to being able to assess the differential treatment claimed by the claimant.Granovsky v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), 2000 SCC 28; Lovelace v Ontario, 2000 SCC 37 In Hodge v. Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development) in 2004, the Supreme Court reiterated that comparator groups were not a \\"threshold issue\\" and that the entire Law test was to be applied on the basis of comparing the claimant and his or her treatment to other groups. In R. v. KappR v Kapp, 2008 SCC 41. in 2008, however, the Court recognized that the comparator group analysis could resurface in the shape of a formal analysis \\"focussed on treating likes alike.\\" This decision marked the beginning of a shift of the Supreme Court away from the comparator group analysis. ==Recent developments and applications== The requirement to identify a comparator group is no longer necessary when making a discrimination complaint under section 15 of the Charter or section 5(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA), though it may still be employed as tool to show discrimination. In 2007, the First Nation Child and Family Caring Society (FNCFCS) brought a complaint against the Federal Government of Canada for racial discrimination in the provision of child welfare services pursuant to section 15 of the Charter and section 5(b) of the CHRA.First Nations Child and Family Caring Society v. Attorney General of Canada, 2012 FC 445. The complaint was heard in front of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, which ruled that there was no comparator group available to differentiate the welfare services on-reserve First Nations children received. Therefore, discrimination could not be proven. The FNCFCS then appealed to the Federal Court. The 2011 Supreme Court case of Withler v. Attorney General (Canada)Withler v. Attorney General of Canada, 2011 SCC 12. was a section 15 Charter class action against federal legislation for alleged age discrimination. Though the Court ruled against the claimants, it laid to rest the idea that a comparator group was necessary to make a discrimination complaint. It said \\"[i]n summary, a mirror comparator group analysis may fail to capture substantive inequality, may become a search for sameness, may shortcut the second stage of the substantive equality analysis, and may be difficult to apply. In all these ways, such an approach may fail to identify ‚Äî and, indeed, thwart the identification of ‚Äî the discrimination at which s. 15 is aimed.\\" As Withler was decided only ten days before the FNCFCS Tribunal ruling, the Tribunal did not consider it when it made its decision. However, the 2012 Federal Court appeal relied heavily on Withler. The Court clarified that requiring a comparator group was not only inconsistent with leading jurisprudence, legislation and international commitments, but also affirmed that it \\"may even thwart the objective of substantive equality ‚Äì the animating purpose of both section 15 of the Charter and the Canadian Human Rights Act.\\" ==CriticismFormal and substantive equality=== A number of scholars and organizations have criticized the comparator group analysis as favouring a formal approach to equality rather than a substantive one.Donna Greschner, \\"Does Law Advance the Cause of Equality?\\" (2001) 27 Queen's L.J. 299 at 301; Diana Majury, \\"The Charter, Equality Rights, and Women: Equivocation and Celebration\\" (2002) 40 Osgoode Hall L.J. 297, at 306 A substantive equality approach recognizes, as the Court did in Andrews, that discrimination can be prevented or remedied by differential treatment according to the specific needs of the person or group targeted. Formal equality, by contrast, analyzes whether the law in question treats the individual rationally according to his or her characteristics, without taking account of that individual's disadvantage or whether the treatment would perpetuate that disadvantage.Bruce Ryder, Cidalia C. Faria and Emily Lawrence, \\"What's Law Good For? An Empirical Overview of Charter Equality Rights Decisions\\" (2004) 24 S.C.L.R. (2d) 103. The danger of the formal equality analysis is that it \\"can readily...forgive state policies that impose subordinating differential treatment on disadvantaged groups so long as those policies have a rational basis.\\" By asking claimants to identify the relevant comparator group, analyses can then fall into an assessment of whether the claimant has been or simply should be treated \\"the same\\" as the group in question without regard to his or her disadvantage. ===Non-comparative types of discrimination=== Some forms of discrimination, such as stereotyping, may not lend themselves to an analysis by comparison with other groups.Sophia R. Moreau, \\"Equality Rights and the Relevance of Comparator Groups\\" (2006) 5 J.L. & Equal. For example, a deaf person who prefers to communicate using speech and lip-reading could be discriminated against by a government policy providing only sign-language interpretation, and no closed-captioning, during parliamentary debates. The claimant in this case is not claiming that she be treated like others based on assumptions that she is like other deaf people, but that she be treated on the basis of the personal characteristics. In this case, comparing her treatment to that of deaf people who communicate using sign-language would not resolve the discrimination, because the government could respond by taking away any interpretation for the hearing-impaired during parliamentary debates and thus treating all deaf people the same. ===Problems in choice of comparator group=== Claimants or courts may have difficulty choosing the right comparator group. For example, to assess whether a government's act had consequences in terms of equality of treatment, the claimant would need to be situated in a group that would then be compared to another group that is being treated differently. For example, in the case of Vriend v. Alberta,Vriend v Alberta [1998] 1 SCR 493 the claim was that the exclusion of 'sexual orientation' as a prohibited ground of discrimination in the Alberta Individual Rights Protection Act amounted to discrimination. To understand if this omission treated homosexuals differently from other vulnerable groups, they would need to be compared to just such groups. However, if the claim is that the failure to include homosexuals perpetuated oppression against them, then the relevant comparator group might be dominant social groups that oppress homosexuals. ===Comparator groups and disabilities=== The Supreme Court has acknowledged that requiring a comparator group for discrimination claims based on disability is problematic. Comparator groups for those with disabilities have either been drawn from those with no disabilities or those with different disabilities.Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61. Either scenario can impede access to substantive justice. In Moore v. British Columbia (Education), a complaint was brought on behalf of Jeffrey, a dyslexic child, for discrimination in education. At issue was whether Moore should be compared to the general population, to other students with disabilities or whether the comparator group analysis was \\"both unnecessary and inappropriate.\\" The Supreme Court reasoned that comparing Moore to the general student population was inappropriate on the grounds that he needed special programs, while other students did not. The Court also rationalized that comparing a dyslexic student to other special needs students would allow the province to discriminate equally against all students with disabilities and still be immune from discrimination complaints. The Court decided against using a comparator group analysis. ===Comparator groups and First Nations=== Jurisprudence suggests that because of Aboriginal peoples' unique place in Canadian society, finding an appropriate comparator group is problematic. Services that are normally provided through provincial jurisdiction are provided to First Nations peoples by the federal government, which owes a fiduciary duty to them. No other group receives the same treatment, meaning that comparator groups would be difficult to identify and could possibly bar First Nations people from making discrimination complaints on the basis of race in the provision of services. Regardless of the difficulties, the Federal Court has named a possible comparator group for on-reserve Aboriginal children, when comparing the quality of welfare services. The Federal Government has enacted various legislation that mandates all welfare services provided to on-reserve First Nations children be of the same standards as those offered by the reference province. Accordingly, children who receive off-reserve welfare services would be the comparator group. How this will affect the FNCFCS complaint is yet to be determined. ==References *First Nations and Child Caring Society Homepage *First Nations Child and Family Caring Society v Attorney General of Canada, 2012 FC 445 *Moore v British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 31 *Withler v Attorney General of Canada, 2011 SCC 12 *Andrews v Law Society of British Columbia 1989 1 SCR 143 *Granovsky v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), 2000 SCC 28 *Law v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 1999 1 SCR 497 *R v Kapp, 2008 SCC 41 *Hodge v Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development), 2004 SCC 65 *Vriend v Alberta, 1998 1 SCR 493 *Lovelace v Ontario, 2000 SCC 37 Category:Human rights in Canada ","title":"Comparator groups analysis in Canadian equality law"},{"id":"41964591","text":"Resilient is the fifteenth studio album by Running Wild, released on 4 October 2013 via Steamhammer Records. ==Track listingAlbum Information== In a 2013 interview, Rolf Kasparek described the album as audibly tougher and more compact than the previous album Shadowmaker.

The Columbia Biographical Dictionary and Portrait Gallery of the Representative Men of the United States, Wisconsin Volume, Part 1. Chicago: Lewis Publishing Company: 1895, Biographical Sketch of Winchel Bacon, pg. 194-200 == Background == Bacon was born August 21, 1816 in Stillwater, New York, son of Samuel and Lydia Barber Dailey Bacon. He worked as a clerk in Troy, New York for a couple of years. In 1836 he was baptized in the Unadilla River by Elder Jabez Swan; he would remain a lifelong Baptist. He joined his parents in their 1837 move to Butternuts, New York. On July 4, 1838, he married Delia Blackwell, a native of Butternuts. For four years he farmed in Butternuts, teaching school in the winters. On September 2, 1841, the couple left for the west, going by canal from Utica to Buffalo, New York, by steamer from thence to Milwaukee in the Wisconsin Territory, and west from there to what was then called \\"Prairieville\\" (now Waukesha), where they would settle for the rest of their lives. == In Wisconsin == Bacon farmed (as he would for the rest of his active life), and taught school, primarily in the winter, through 1844. From 1843, he engaged in the wagon-making and blacksmithing business, in partnership with either his brother-in-law Charles Blackwell or one Edmund Clinton. About 1850 he traded the shop he'd built in Waukesha for a steam-powered sawmill in Brookfield. == Politics and public office == Originally a Whig, Bacon was active in organizing the Liberty Party and then the Free Soil Party in Wisconsin. In 1852, he was elected to a single term in the Assembly from Waukesha as a Free Soiler. He was on the commission that selected a location for a reform school; with his influence, this was sited in Waukesha County, becoming the Wisconsin Industrial School for Boys. He served as its acting director, and supervised the erection of its first buildings. For years he was a trustee of the Wisconsin Hospital for the Insane, and was then appointed a trustee of the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb. He also held various local offices, including school board member and president of the village board,The History of Waukesha County, Wisconsin: Containing an Account of Its Settlement, Growth, Development, and Resources etc.... Chicago: Western Historical Company, 1880; pp. 641, 670. Bacon was an abolitionist, and active in the Underground Railroad; it was at his home that fugitive slave Joshua Glover was sheltered on the first night after he had been broken out of jail in Milwaukee in 1854. He became active in the Republican Party after it was founded in Wisconsin, publishing the Waukesha Republican, a campaign newspaper, for three months in 1856 which was credited with raising the Republican margins sufficiently to ensure the election of John F. Potter to Congress. In June 1861, after the outbreak of the American Civil War, Bacon (who was already chairman of the county's \\"Central War Committee\\" to organize and coordinate war efforts) was commissioned by Governor Randall to make purchases of military supplies in New York for Wisconsin (supplies in Wisconsin had been exhausted), a task he completed on time and under budget.Fish, Carl R. \\"The Raising of the Wisconsin Volunteers, 1861.\\" The Military Historian and Economist Vol. 1, No. 3 (July 1916), pp. 258-273 On February 26, 1863, Bacon was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln as a paymaster for the United States Army, with the rank of major. He served a while in St. Louis, Missouri but resigned, as he said that his business interests required that he return to Wisconsin (a recurrent theme throughout his career; he felt that he could not spend more than a few days away from his business[es]). == Personal, religious and civic activities == Bacon was a teetotaler, and a strong advocate of the temperance movement. He was active in the Baptist church, and served at a trustee of several Baptist-affiliated organizations, including the University of Chicago and Wayland Academy, as well as Carroll College, where he also taught for three terms. He was a long- time supporter of evangelist Dwight L. Moody. He was an active Mason. From his first arrival in Prairieville to the final illness which confined him to his home, Bacon never ceased work as a farmer; in 1853, he won prizes at the Wisconsin State Fair in the farming implements category.Wisconsin State Agricultural Society. Transactions of the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society, with Portions of the Correspondence of the Secretary Vol. III-1853. Madison: Beriah Brown, State Printer, 1854; p. 48 Between 1861 and 1871 he was several times elected President of the Waukesha County Agricultural Society, whose charter he had helped write in 1856. He held shares in the Waukesha County Bank, and from 1865-1868 served as president of the Farmers' Nation Bank in Waukesha, of which he was majority shareholder. It was liquidated in 1868, not because of lack of success, but because Bacon needed the capitol for other purposes. He and Delia (Blackwood) Bacon had five children, of whom three lived to adulthood. She died February 12, 1880. On September 15, 1883, he married Clara Campbell, of Muncy, Pennsylvania. He died March 20, 1894 at his home in Waukesha, after a lingering illness of more than three years' duration, and was buried in that city which had grown up around him.

Originally known as Evergreen City, the settlement was existent by summer 1889, due to the construction of the Belmont Tunnel. However, when the town site was surveyed in 1890, only five blocks were sold. Belmont reached its population peak of around eighty residents in the late 1920s. The trend of declining population started with the Great Depression and accelerated with changes in transportation. Improved vehicles meant that shopping and selling of farm products could be done in larger towns nearby, and the Burlington Railroad ceased passenger service in 1969. ==History== Shortly after the founding of Dawes County in 1885, two townships in its southwestern portion were designated the Evergreen Precinct. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad built a rail line through the precinct in 1888‚Äì1889, and decided the deep canyons of the area made a tunnel necessary. A construction camp was soon erected near the tunnel site, and by the time the railroad reached the temporary community, now known as Evergreen City, around two hundred men were employed working on the tunnel. When residents applied for a post office, their request was rejected, as there was already another Evergreen City in Nebraska. Ergo, the stop was renamed Belmont by the railroad, after one of its officials. The Belmont post office was established November 9, 1889; its first postmaster was Clarence L. Phelps. It continued operation for 67 years under 18 subsequent postmasters before closing on May 11, 1956. The area was hit by a drought and economic depression in 1890‚Äì1891, and over the course of the next decade, the population of the Evergreen Precinct dropped by more than 50%. As a result, after Belmont was platted in 1890, only five blocks of the survey had been sold by 1893. However, by World War I, the rural economy had started to rebound, and Belmont reached its population peak in the late 1920s, with around eighty residents. At this time it boasted two general stores, two churches, a lumberyard, a brick school, and numerous residences. Unfortunately, the Great Depression began a downward trend for Belmont. Improved vehicles meant that shopping and selling of farm products could be done in larger towns nearby; Belmont's last store burned in 1949 and was never rebuilt. Additionally, Belmont was economically dependent on the railroad, which ceased passenger service in 1969 because of society's increasing favor of the automobile for transportation. Belmont's depot was closed soon after. Today, Belmont consists of a small cluster of buildings on a gravel road. Several historic structures are still intact, including the now-bypassed Belmont Tunnel and the aforementioned Belmont School. The town cemetery also remains. ==Education== 1927 Belmont schoolhouse School District 39 was created on September 13, 1888. Its first school building was a small wooden structure located west of Belmont, built a year later. By the 1926‚Äì1927 school year the structure had deteriorated and was deemed too small for the district's student population, leading to the erection of a two-story brick school in Belmont in 1927. The old school was moved and converted into a granary. The Belmont school stopped teaching high school classes in 1948, and started teaching Kindergarten during the fall of the following year. It also served Belmont as a spot for meetings and community dinners. The institution was active until 2008, when it was consolidated into the school district of Crawford. The building was sold at auction in 2010, and currently is being converted to a private residence, despite a fire caused by lightning in 2013. ==Geography== Belmont is located at (42.549722, -103.356667). ==References== Category:Ghost towns in Nebraska Category:Populated places established in 1889 Category:Populated places in Dawes County, Nebraska ","title":"Belmont, Nebraska"},{"id":"41964695","text":"Frisk is the name of a line of breath mint candies produced by Frisk International and distributed worldwide by Perfetti Van Melle.

It is the location where Major Samuel Appleton is said to have made a speech denouncing the tyranny of Colonial Governor Sir Edmund Andros. ==Speech== On September 19, 1687, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Samuel Appleton of Ipswich, Dudley Bradstreet of Andover, and Nathaniel Saltonstall of Haverhill for being \\"persons factiously and seditiously inclined, and disaffected to his Majesty's government\\". Two additional warrants were issued on October 3 and October 5. It is believed that during this time, Appleton hid in the home of his son, Colonel Samuel Appleton, who owned the Saugus Iron Works property (in what was then part of Lynn, Massachusetts). While there, Appleton, according to tradition, delivered an address from a rocky cliff near the Iron Works in which he denounced the tyranny of Andros. The place where he is said to have delivered the speech became known as Appleton's Pulpit. ===Accuracy=== In Ipswich in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Thomas Franklin Waters disputed the traditional account of events. The October 5 warrant was issued for Samuel Appleton of Lynn for hiding from officers of the law. While it could be inferred that Samuel Appleton was hiding in Lynn and the warrant specified \\"Samuel Appleton of Lynn\\" to ensure his arrest, Appleton would testify in his sworn deposition that he was arrested on September 20 and remained in custody until his ultimate release. Therefore, the October 5 warrant was likely for his son, also named Samuel Appleton, who lived in Lynn from 1680 to 1688. Waters also stated that it is improbable that a fugitive from justice would openly harangue the public from a high ledge. However, if the event did take place, Waters contended that it was the younger Appleton who delivered the speech. ==Historical markers== Thomas Gold Appleton, a descendant of Samuel Appleton, had a tablet about two and a half feet square fastened to the perpendicular face of the cliff, just below where the speech is supposed to have been made. It was formally presented to the Town of Saugus in March 1882. The tablet read In 1930, the Massachusetts Bay Colony Tercentenary Commission erected a number of historical markers around the state.

After a year of closure starting in 2015, the facility was reopened under lease and has been operated by the Oklahoma Department of Corrections. It is from downtown Sayre. ==History== It was built for $37 million. This prison had 1,440 prisoners and 270 employees as of 2001, and that year Peter T. Kilborn of The New York Times wrote that the prison \\"is responsible for lifting Sayre's spirits and reigniting its economy.\\" The facility housed just under 1,000 prisoners from the state of Wisconsin until August 2003, when Wisconsin ended the contract over a dispute about high long- distance telephone rates involving the prison contractor, the town of Sayre, and telecommunications provider AT&T.; (The prisoners were transferred to CCA's nearby Diamondback Correctional Facility in Watonga, Oklahoma, which was subsequently closed.)

His death was ruled a homicide, and his cellmate moved to segregated housing pending an investigation. CCA closed the facility in 2015 and returned its population, about two thousand inmates, back to California via its private prisons in Mississippi and Arizona with regards to the individual inmates security rating. In 2016 the state struck a deal with CCA that provided for an eighteen-month lease at no cost, and the return of state prisoners to state management as of July 1, 2016.

He was from Tang Dynasty's capital Chang'an. His grandfather Lu Jianqiu () served as a military governor (Jiedushi), while his father Lu Siye () served as You Bujue (), a low-level consultant at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng).New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 55. == During Later Liang == At some point, Lu Wenji passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class. (It is not clear whether this was while Tang still existed, or during the succeeding Later Liang.) In any case, he eventually served as the deputy minister of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Xingbu Shilang) and imperial scholar at Jixian Hall (). == During Later Tang  During Li Siyuan's reign === In 926, during the reign of Li Siyuan, the second emperor of the succeeding Later Tang, Lu Wenji was commissioned as the deputy chief imperial censor (Âæ°Âè≤‰∏≠‰∏û, Yushi Zhongcheng). (He had, prior to that, served as the deputy minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Libu Shilang).Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 37. At that time, the customs were that the other officials would go the office of the imperial censors to congratulate the new deputy chief. The circuits' liaison officers at the capital were expected to go, present their name cards to the clerks of the deputy chief, and receive tea and wine from the deputy chief to thank them for coming, without actually meeting with the deputy chief. Lu's staff members, however, informed him that the previous Tang regulations were that the liaison officers were to actually meet with and bow to the deputy chief to congratulate him. Lu, wanting to emulate proper Tang customs, had the clerks escort the liaison officers into the hall, where Lu was seated, and bow to him. The liaison officers felt humiliated, and they complained to Li Siyuan's chief of staff (Shumishi) An Chonghui. An pointed out that he himself was unfamiliar with Tang regulations, and referred them directly to the emperor. When they went to complain to Li Siyuan, Li Siyuan, after consulting with the chancellor Zhao Feng, who pointed out that these liaison officers were merely low-level officers at their circuits entrusted to deliver messages, stated in anger, \\"These are just functionaries and soldiers. How dare they disrespect my judicial official!\\" He had them caned and ejected. At Lu's request, Li Siyuan also issued an edict reinstating the Tang regulations for performance review for officials ‚Äî which also included self-evaluations for generals, chancellors, and the emperor himself. However, the edict was not actually implemented. After about a year, Lu was made the minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Gongbu Shangshu). Thereafter (apparently in 928), the chancellor Cui Xie, with whom Lu had a contentious relationship, made the official Yu Ye () the deputy minister of public works. Lu was angered, because Yu Ye's name coincided with that of his own father Lu Siye. When Yu reported to the ministry of public works and tried to meet with him to greet him, Lu refused to receive him, and avoided meeting him by repeatedly taking off days. Thereafter, there was an occasion when Yu was sent by Li Siyuan to be an emissary to Zhangwu Circuit (ÂΩ∞Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Yan'an, Shaanxi); even before Yu departed then-capital Luoyang, however, Lu resumed his duties. Yu, in anger at this disrespect, committed suicide by hanging after he fell drunk. When this incident became known, Li Siyuan exiled Lu by demoting him to be the military advisor to the prefect of Shi Prefecture (Áü≥Â∑û, in modern L√ºliang, Shanxi).Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 39. At a later point, Lu was recalled to Luoyang, and he thereafter served successively as the director of the archival bureau (Á•ïÊõ∏Áõ£, Mishu Jian), and then the minister of worship (Â§™Â∏∏Âçø, Taichang Qing). In 933, as of which time he was again serving as the minister of public works, he and L√º Qi () were sent as emissaries to Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), then ruled by the major warlord Meng Zhixiang, to create Meng the Prince of Shu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. On their journey to Xichuan, they went through Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), where Li Siyuan's adoptive son Li Congke was then serving as military governor. Lu impressed Li Congke with his impressive appearance and ability to speak. === During Li Congke's reign === In 934, Li Congke overthrew then-emperor Li Conghou (Li Siyuan's biological son and successor), and became emperor. At that time, the leading chancellors were Liu Xu and Li Yu, but they were often arguing with each other and not getting much done in terms of governance. Li Congke was not happy about this situation and considered replacing them. When he consulted with his close associates, they recommended Yao Yi, Lu Wenji, and Cui Jujian (). Because Yao, Lu, and Cui each had their strengths and weaknesses, Li Congke could not decide on whom to commission. He therefore wrote their names on pieces of paper and placed the paper in a crystal bottle. After offering incense to heaven, he used chopsticks to take the paper out of the bottle. Lu's name was taken out first, followed by Yao. He therefore commissioned Lu and Yao as chancellors (with Lu's commission coming first). In the commission, Lu received the titles of Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé, deputy head of the legislative bureau) and the chancellor designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. In 935, there was an incident where the official Shi Zaide (), whose was said to be blunt and daring, submitted a number of petitions attacking the capabilities of a number of officials and generals, suggesting to Li Congke that he test these officials and generals and demote the ones who were not capable. This drew much anger among the criticized officials. Lu, as well as the consultants Liu Tao () and Yang Zhaojian (), all suggested that Shi be punished. Li Congke, however, believed that this would discourage open discussions about the affairs of state, issued an edict rejecting their request to punish Shi. Meanwhile, Li Congke believed that the chancellors were not giving him good advice, and was often urging them to do so. Lu and the other chancellors blamed the situation on the fact that they did not, unlike the chancellors during Tang, get a chance to meet with just the emperor at Yanying Hall (), and asked that the Yanying Hall meetings be reinstated. Li Congke, however, found this to be unnecessary, and issued an edict stating that he would be willing to meet with them whenever they wanted, and that the Yanying Hall meetings would be unnecessary. In 936, Li Congke's adoptive brother-in-law Shi Jingtang the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) rebelled, with aid from Later Tang's northern rival Khitan Empire. Li Congke sent the general Zhang Jingda against Shi, but the combined Khitan/Hedong forces defeated Zhang and subsequently put him under siege. Li Congke, distressed about the situation, stated to Lu, \\"We had previously heard that you, Lord, has the ability to be chancellor, and therefore we made you the leading chancellor despite opposition from others. Now we are facing this disaster. Where are your good strategies?\\" Lu only could apologize and had nothing further to say. Li Congke, at that time, was himself hesitant to engage Shi, and Lu, sensing this, proposed, along with Zhang Yanlang, that the chief of staff Zhao Yanshou be sent to rendezvous with his adoptive father Zhao Dejun the military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing), to combat the Khitan/Hedong forces. Li Congke agreed. The result was a disaster, however, as Zhao Dejun was more interested in gaining Khitan support for his own desire to be emperor, and did not fully intend to aid Zhang. Eventually, Zhang's army ran out of food, and Zhang's deputy Yang Guangyuan assassinated him and surrendered. The Khitan/Hedong forces then defeated Zhao. Believing that all was lost, Li Congke committed suicide with his family, ending Later Tang. Shi, whom Khitan's Emperor Taizong had declared emperor of a new state of Later Jin, entered Luoyang and took over Later Tang's territory.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. == During Later Jin == Upon Shi Jingtang's entry into Luoyang, he largely pardoned the Later Tang officials and retained them in his government. Lu Wenji, however, was removed from his post as chancellor, and made the minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu). He was later further removed from this relatively substantive post and given the ceremonial post of Taizi Shaofu (). During the reign of Shi Jingtang's nephew and successor Shi Chonggui, he was given the higher ceremonial post of Taizi Taifu (). == During Later Han == During the reign of Liu Zhiyuan, the founding emperor of the subsequent Later Han, Lu Wenji received the title of Taizi Taishi (). At that time, the capital was at Kaifeng, but many officials not directly involved in imperial governance were given offices at Luoyang. It was said that their conduct was often not proper, and that, while the branch government at Luoyang had imperial censors stationed at them, the imperial censors were not effective in correcting their behavior. Liu put Lu in charge of overseeing the situation and reorganizing these Luoyang officials more effectively. Subsequently, the imperial censor Zhao Li () submitted a list of officials that he believed were not engaged in proper behavior, including taking excessive leaves on alleged illnesses. After Liu's chief of staff Yang Bin received this list, he forced the officials Zhao accused into retirement. As Lu was also overseeing the behavior of these Luoyang officials, he ran into frequent conflicts with Yang on this issue, and therefore Lu requested a leave on account of illness ‚Äî and then was accused by the censors of improperly claiming a sick leave. He therefore was then ordered into retirement with the title of Taizi Taishi. == During Later Zhou == After Guo Wei, the founding emperor of the subsequent Later Zhou, took the throne, he sent an emissary to Lu Wenji's mansion to bestow the title of Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫, one of the Three Excellencies) on Lu. Lu died later that year and was given posthumous honors. It was said that throughout his career, Lu accumulated great wealth, but upon his death, his son Lu Guiling () spent it all within a span of several years, and that Lu Wenji thus became a cautionary tale for many, against excessive accumulation of wealth. == Notes and references == * Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 127. * New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 55. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 278, 279, 280.

In the 1950s it was named after U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower who unsuccessfully lobbied to have it taken down after it interfered with his golf game. Due to its size, history, and location on a prominent golf course, it is considered iconic of the Augusta golf course and is one of the most famous trees in American golf. It was called \\"among the most famous landmarks in golf\\" by Cindy Boren in the Washington Post and \\"arguably the most famous tree in golf\\" by Martin Dempster of The Scotsman. In February 2014, the tree was removed after suffering extensive damage from a major ice storm. ==Description and origins== The tree species was a native loblolly pine. It stood about tall and was wider than is typical. It was located on the 17th hole at the Augusta National Golf Club, approximately from the Masters tee on the left side of the fairway. It was estimated to be 100 to 125 years old at the time it died. Eisenhower was an Augusta National member who spent considerable time at the club. Indeed, in November 1952 when President-elect Eisenhower needed to be briefed by an atomic energy official on highly classified nuclear matters, including that the first successful hydrogen bomb test had been held, a secret meeting was held in the manager's office within the clubhouse at Augusta National. But as much as he liked Augusta National, Eisenhower hit the tree on the 17th fairway while playing golf so many times that, at a 1956 club meeting, he proposed that it be cut down. Not wanting to offend the president, the club's chairman, Clifford Roberts, immediately adjourned the meeting rather than reject the request. The tree was linked to Eisenhower ever since; when Ike ran for President, there were bumper-stickers that read \\"Ben Hogan For President. If We're Going To Have A Golfer--Let's Have A Good One!\\" ==Golfing history== The Eisenhower Tree has played a prominent role in the annual Masters Tournament. One year, the Tree came into play as Tommy Aaron hit a shot off the 17th tee which became known as the \\"Lost Ball Incident\\". The ball could not be located and a drop was given. The next day according to Aaron, while playing on the 17th again, the ball apparently fell from its perch within the tree. Jack Nicklaus stated \\"I'm not sure I believe it.\\" When the course was redesigned in 1999 to be more challenging, there were concerns about the tree blocking players but it proved not to be a hindrance. (Database: NewsBank, Retrieved February 18, 2014 ) In 2011, Tiger Woods was playing a shot from underneath the Eisenhower and damaged his left knee and Achilles tendon when he slipped on some pine straw. The injuries sidelined him until August 2011 and his world ranking dropped to 58th. ==Damage and replacement== In February 2014, the Eisenhower Tree was removed after suffering extensive damage during a major ice storm. \\"The loss of the Eisenhower Tree is difficult news to accept\\", Augusta National chairman Billy Payne said. \\"We obtained opinions from the best arborists available and ‚Ä¶ were advised that no recovery was possible.\\" The storm occurred two months before the Masters Tournament. A remnant of the tree was donated to the Eisenhower Presidential Library in Abilene, Kansas and is on display. The loss of the tree brought tributes. Jack Nicklaus said, \\"The Eisenhower Tree is such an iconic fixture and symbol of tradition at Augusta National. It was such an integral part of the game and one that will be sorely missed.\\" There is another tree named after Eisenhower, located at Dalmeny Golf Club in Scotland, planted by the President during a visit to Edinburgh to receive the freedom of the city in 1946. On hearing of the death in Augusta, the club offered to provide an acorn to plant a new oak tree. A few yards beyond the Eisenhower Tree, another tree was planted a number of years ago. This tree was also removed due to the ice storm. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Posnanski, Joe (February 17, 2014). \\"In Memoriam: Eisenhower's Tree\\". The Golf Channel.

As early as 2009, health researchers identified particular medical needs and health vulnerabilities amongst these populations.Newbold, B. \\"The Short-term Health of Canada‚Äôs New Immigrant Arrivals: Evidence from LSIC.\\" Ethnicity & Health 14.2 (2009): 315-36. Compared to other immigrants, they report more physical, emotional, and dental problemsNewbold, B., and M.

Canadian Medical Association, 2011. In Canada, the federal government has been responsible for the provision of health care to refugees since 1957. Under international law, this responsibility falls under Canada's human rights obligations to recognize the right to health for all, including refugees. ==Right to healthInternational law=== The concept of a ‚Äúright to health‚Äù has been recognized in a number of international rights instruments to which Canada is a party.International Human Rights instruments that acknowledge a ‚Äúright to health‚Äù to which Canada is a party include: The 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: art. 12, the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination: art. 5 (e) (iv), the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women: arts. 11 (1) (f), 12 and 14 (2) (b), the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child: art. 24, and the 2006 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: art. 25. It was first articulated in the 1946 Constitution of the World Health Organization as ‚Äúthe right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\\"Constitution of the World Health Organization (Official Records of the World Health Organization, no. 2, p. 100) and entered into force on 7 April 1948, art. 12. Article 25 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights also mentions the right to health as part of the right to an adequate standard of living.Universal Declaration of Human Rights, G.A. res. 217A (III), U.N. Doc A/810 at 71 (1948). Some international human rights instruments acknowledge a right to health by general application and others through the protection of rights of specific groups such as women or children. In 1966, the right to health was recognized as a human right in article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which imposes an obligation on state parties to the Covenant to create ‚Äúconditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness‚Äù.International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights GA res. 2200A (XXI), 21 UN GAOR Supp. (No. 16) at 49, UN Doc. A/6316 (1966); 993 UNTS 3; 6 ILM 368 (1967), art. 12. ===Canadian law=== The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms does not include any express protection of the right to health. The Canadian government has frequently argued in court that social and economic rights‚Äîincluding the right to health‚Äîare merely ‚Äòpolicy objectives‚Äô that are not subject to judicial intervention.Porter, B. \\"Judging Poverty: Using International Human Rights Law to Refine the Scope of Charter Rights.\\" Journal of Law and Social Policy 14 (2000): 139-40. The ICESCR Committee has voiced concern over Canada's lack of compliance to these international obligations. It argues that such submissions are incompatible with Canada's obligations to provide remedies to violations of Covenant rights in domestic law.United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Concluding Observations on Canada, E/C12/1993 (10 June 1993), para 15. Charter Cases Right to health claims under the Charter's section 15 equality provision have had limited success. In Eldridge v. British Columbia, in the context of the provision of sign language, the Supreme Court found that the government should ensure that disadvantaged members of society have equal access to benefits. The Court noted that any finding to the contrary would result in a ‚Äúthin and impoverished view‚Ä¶ of equality‚Äù.Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General) [1997] 2 S.C.R. 624, para 13. In a later case about the provision of autism services, Auton v. British Columbia, the Court narrowed the Eldridge approach by requiring that protected benefits be ones ‚Äúprovided by law‚Äù.Auton (Guardian ad litem of) v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [2004] 3 S.C.R. 657, 2004 SCC 78, para 27. Though a substantive equality approach to section 15 has had limited success in remedying health and other social and economic rights violations of disadvantaged groups, Colleen Flood, one of Canada's leading health law professors, argues that failed claims can contribute to furthering equality by illuminating a problem and generating political support for its resolution.Flood, Colleen. \\"Charter Rights and Health Care Funding: A Typology of Canadian Health Rights Litigation.\\" Annals Health L. 19 (2010): 479. == Interim Federal Health Programme (IFHP) == In Canada, the provision of basic health care for refugees and refugee claimants is regulated by the Interim Federal Health Programme (IFHP) before they are covered by provincial or territorial health insurance plans. The IFHP was introduced through an Order in Council by the federal government in 1957,Order in Council PC 157-11/848, June 20, 1957. and has been managed by Citizenship and Immigration Canada since 1995. Prior to June 2012, the IFHP provided refugees and asylum seekers with basic health care coverage as well as supplemental coverage including access to medication, dentistry, and vision care.Government of Canada, Citizenship and Immigration Canada, News Release, 2012: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/media/releases/2012/2012-04-25.asp. Those whose application for refugee status were denied retained coverage until they were deported. === 2012 Reform === The Canadian government introduced a series of changes in April 2012. As of its date of effect on 30 June 2012, IFHP divides asylum seekers into three categories with differing levels of health coverage depending upon the person's country of origin. There are now three baskets of services: # expanded health care coverage; # health care coverage; and # public health or public safety health care coverage. If the refugee claimant is from a designated country of origin, they will receive ‚Äúvery limited‚Äù health coverage.Government of Canada, Citizenship and Immigration Canada, IFHP Info Sheet: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/outside/ifhp-info-sheet.asp. Some of the provinces have stepped in to cover services and medication no longer provided under the IFHP.\\"Refugee Health-care Cuts by Ottawa before the Courts.\\" CBC News: Politics [Toronto] 30 Jan. 2014.  Government rationale  In defending the changes, the government explained its rationale as being to ensure equality between the health care received by refugees and that afforded to Canadians such that refugees would not receive superior benefits. Former Citizenship and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney emphasized the generosity of Canadians and Canada's immigration system, stating that the government did ‚Äúnot want to ask Canadians to pay for benefits for protected persons and refugee claimants that are more generous than what they are entitled to themselves.‚Äù In a related case, Nell Toussaint v. Attorney General of Canada, the Supreme Court cautioned that by extending universal health care regardless of immigration status, Canada ‚Äúcould become a health-care safe haven.‚ÄùSupreme Court of Canada, Judgements to be Rendered in Leave Applications, 2012: http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/news/en/item/3956/index.do. The government also made cost and deterrence arguments in favour of reforming the legislation. These changes were estimated to save $100 million over five years. The government argued that the cuts would deter claimants who are drawn to the country for its health care. Public criticism Critics of the 2012 reforms include the Canadian Medical Association Journal and the Canadian Paediatric Society.Stanbrook, Matthew. \\"Canada Owes Refugees Adequate Health Coverage.\\" Canadian Medical Association Journal 10 (2014): 1; Samson, Lindy, and Charles Hui. Cuts to Refugee Health Program Put Children and Youth at Risk. Canadian Paediatric Association, 2012. The heads of eight major professional associations including nurses, social workers, and physicians signed a letter opposing the cuts, demanding that pre-2012 refugee health provision be restored.Padmos, Andrew, Sandy Buchman, Jeff Poston, John Haggie, Robert Sutherland, Fred Phelps, and Lillian Linton. Letter to Hon. Jason Kenney. 18 May 2012. MS. Ottawa, Ontario These advocates argue that the differential treatment of refugees and refugee applicants depending on their country of origin is discriminatory. Ontario's Health Minister Deb Matthews called for the changes to be reversed stating that ‚Äúthis policy change will create a class system for health care in Canada.‚Äù\\"Kenney Defends Cuts to Extended Health-care Benefits for Refugees.\\" The Globe and Mail [Toronto] 29 June 2012: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/kenney-defends-cuts- to-extended-health-care-benefits-for-refugees/article4382382/. ===Legal challenges of right to health=== The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms does not include any express protection of the right to health, but this right has been protected indirectly by Courts through the use of other provisions, such as the section 15 equality guarantee.Cousins, Mel. \\"Health Care and Human Rights after Auton and Chaoulli.\\" McGill Law Journal 54.4 (2009). Section 15(1) provides that: > [E]very individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to > the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination > and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic > origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.Canadian > Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being > Schedule B to The Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c.11, art. 15(1). The current legal test for a section 15 equality analysis comes from Andrews as affirmed in R v Kapp. It requires that the court satisfy two conditions: (1) the law creates a distinction based on an analogous or enumerated ground; and (2) the distinction creates a disadvantage by perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping.'R v Kapp', 2008 SCC 41, 2 SCR 483, para 17.  CDRC and CARL litigation  The right to health has been litigated under Charter provisions outside of section 15. In December 2013, the Canadian Doctors for Refugee Care (CDRC) and the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers (CARL) brought a challenge to the Federal Court of Canada claiming that the government's cuts to refugee health care were unconstitutional.\\"Backgrounder: Legal Challenge to Cuts to Refugee Healthcare.\\" Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers. 2013. Specifically, CARL proposes that both ‚Äúcountry of origin‚Äù and ‚Äúimmigration status‚Äù are discriminatory grounds under section 15(1) of the Charter.Legal Challenges to Refugee Health Cuts Begin Today, Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers, 17 December 2013 http://www.carl- acaadr.ca/articles/61 The CDRC/CARL challenge to the IFHP reforms is founded on two additional Charter provisions: # the right to life and security of the person under section 7; and # the right not to be subjected to cruel and unusual treatment under section 12. =Nell Toussaint v. Attorney General= Prior to the 2012 reforms, in Nell Toussaint v Attorney General, Toussaint challenged the constitutionality of the IFHP on the basis of the proposed analogous grounds of disability and citizenship.'Toussaint v Canada (Attorney General)', 2011 FCA 213, para 79. The Court found neither of these grounds to be applicable to the claimant in question, but made a point of leaving open the question as to whether immigration status could be an analogous ground. If found to be an analogous ground, the applicant's exclusion from IFHP coverage could have been in violation of section 15(1) of the Charter.'Toussaint v Canada (Attorney General)', 2011 FCA 213, para 81. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association, in its intervenor factum, drew a comparison between immigration status and non-citizens.Nell Toussaint v. Attorney General of Canada, Memorandum of fact and law of the intervenor, the Canadian CIvil Liberties Association, http://ccla.org/wordpress/wp- content/uploads/2011/06/Factum-Toussaint-v.-Attorney-General-of-Canada- November-2011-.pdf. A number of cases have recognized that non-citizens, which capture many different types of immigration statuses, constitute an analogous ground under section 15(1). For example, in Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia, the Court held that citizenship is an analogous ground since it was a personal characteristic ‚Äútypically not within the control of the individual, and in this sense, is immutable.‚Äù'Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia', [1989] 1 SCR 143. In Lavoie v. Canada, the Court held that ‚Äúnon-citizens suffer from political marginalization, stereotyping and historical disadvantage.‚Äù'Lavoie v. Canada', [2002] 1 S.C.R. 769, 2002 SCC 23 == Quality of healthcare  Women's health === Recent studies have identified significant gaps in health care coverage for female refugees, particularly in the areas of pregnancy and mental health care. Specifically, barriers to health care access such financial difficulty have been shown to intersect with other post migration difficulties experienced by women with migrant status like downward social mobility, poor access to optimal nutrition, and limited social networks. Moreover, women with migrant status are more vulnerable to being refused care on the basis of their insurance status, thereby relying on informal networks of volunteers and willing physicians, dentists, and pharmacies.Newbold, K. Bruce, et al. \\"Access to Health Care: The Experiences of Refugee and Refugee Claimant Women in Hamilton, Ontario.\\" Journal of Immigrant & Refugee Studies, vol. 11, no. 4, Oct-Dec2013, pp. 431-449. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1080/15562948.2013.808390. Disparities have further been identified in the area of perinatal care, where uninsured migrant women are shown to receive less overall coverage than their insured counterparts, in addition to paying for diagnostic, physician, and hospital fees, leading to less than optimal outcomes. Mental health issues among female Syrian refugees have been examined, specifically instances of maternal depression. Causes for these mental health issues are varied and include lack of social support, in addition to cultural and socioeconomic factors. Further, migrant and refugee women are more likely to succumb to postpartum depression due to the additional stressors of the migratory experience. === Language barriers === Access to health care for refugees and other migrant populations has been constrained by language barriers, among other cultural factors. A 2012 study showed that roughly sixty percent of government-assisted refugees had no English or French language skills, therefore acting as a deterrent to accessing proper health care. Concerns over privacy are also significant, as some women have expressed reluctance to using interpreters within the same, small ethnic community. However, proper interpreter training may help bridge the gaps between patient and health practitioner, as is the case in British Columbia where the Provincial Health Services Authority trained thirty interpreters in anticipation of the arrival of 3,500 Syrian refugees in 2016.Lake, Stephanie. \\"Not so Universal Health Care: The Neglect of Immigrant and Refugee Health in Canada.\\" UBC Medical Journal, vol. 7, no. 2, Spring2016, pp. 38-39. === Mental health === Steady declines in migrant health have been noted to occur within a few years of arrival in Canada, a phenomenon known as the \\"healthy immigrant effect,\\"Newbold, Bruce. 2009. \\"The Short-Term Health of Canada's New Immigrant Arrivals: Evidence from LSIC.\\" Ethnicity & Health 14(3):315‚Äì36. due largely to Canadian immigration policy and medical evaluations of potential immigration candidates. In a study of Tamil and Iranian female refugees in Canada, instances of mental symptoms such as recurring nightmares, emotional detachment, hyper vigilance, and difficulty concentrating have been noted. Moreover, it has been observed that youth who have experienced living as refugees demonstrate higher levels of emotional problems and aggressive behaviors due to past traumas. It was further noted that instances of post arrival trauma, in the form of discrimination based on race or refugee status, have significant negative effects on mental outcomes for youth. ==References== Category:Healthcare in Canada ","title":"Refugee health care in Canada"},{"id":"41965647","text":"Newcastle Jets Football Club is an Australian professional association football club based in Newcastle West, New South Wales.

It has a single dark green, tube-shaped leaf and up to twenty strongly scented, yellowish-green flowers and is only known from railway reserves near Bairnsdale. ==Description== Prasophyllum correctum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped, yellowish-green leaf which is long and wide near its red to purple base. Between ten and twenty strongly scented, yellowish-green flowers are arranged along a flowering spike long, reaching to a height of . As with other leek orchids, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is linear to egg-shaped, long, about wide and turns downwards, almost to vertical. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, long, about wide and free from each other. The petals are egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long, about wide and upswept with brown striations. The labellum is oblong to egg-shaped, long, about wide, curves upwards and tapers towards a narrow tip, sometimes reaching above the lateral sepals. The edges of the labellum are usually not crinkled or wavy but there is a fleshy, green, grooved callus in its centre. Flowering occurs in October and November. ==Taxonomy and naming== Prasophyllum correctum was first formally described in 1994 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Stratford and the description was published in the journal Novon. When David Jones described an apparently new species of Prasophyllum collected in 1991 near Bairnsdale, he gave it the name P. chasmogamum. It was later found that the orchid described was in fact Prasophyllum pyriforme and another specimen of a new species collected at the same site had been overlooked. The overlooked specimen was given the specific epithet (correctum) in recognition of the earlier mistake. ==Distribution and habitat== The gaping leek orchid leek orchid grows in grassland and woodland in two locations between Stratford and Bairnsdale. ==Conservation== Prasophyllum correctum is only known from two locations with a total population of fewer than 150 plants. It is classified as Threatened under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 and as Endangered under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. The main threats to the species are competition from other plants including introduced species, grazing by rabbits and inappropriate fire regimes. ==References== correctum Category:Flora of Victoria (Australia) Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Plants described in 1994 ","title":"Prasophyllum correctum"},{"id":"41965760","text":"Beverley Minster where he lived Bercthun of Beverley (died 15 May 733) also known as Bertin and Britwin, Saint Bercthun of Beverley at Saints.SQPN.com.

He initially worked as a policeman, but was then influenced by the ideology of Vivekananda. ==Pre- monastic days== Kedarnath Moulik was born in the year 1876, though the date is not known. He was born and educated in Varanasi (Benares). His father's name was Shambhu Chandra Moulik and his ancestral home was situated in the area called Sonarpura. He lost his mother in early childhood and was brought up under the care and guidance of his grandfather, Ramachandra Moulik. Although he was a Bengali by origin, he could not write in Bengali, though he spoke and understood the language. He had a good command over Persian. Kedarnath had a large library in his house and subscribed to various journals on different subjects. He joined the police force after finishing school. About the same time he came in contact with a group of young men who were very inspired by the ideals of Vivekananda. One of them was Charuchandra Das, who later joined Ramakrishna Order and became a direct monastic disciple of Vivekananda and became known as Shubhananda. The group used to study religion and philosophy and Girish Chandra Ghosh was one of their favourite authors. Charuchandra had his friend subscribing to Udbodhan, the Bengali magazine of Ramakrishna Order. Kedarnath was inspired after listening to Vivekananda's prologue in the first issue of Udbodhan. Niranjananda, a direct disciple of Ramakrishna, was then practicing spiritual discipline in Benares. He was invited to the study circle. Kedarnath, as per his own version, was greatly inspired by seeing the photograph of Ramakrishna which he installed in his library on the occasion of Niranjananda's visit and which he saw for the first time. Niranjananda during the course of his stay in Benares would often visit and inspire the young group towards selfless service and renunciation. Under his guidance Kedarnath began his spiritual practice and since his service posed problem in spiritual path, he resigned and devoted his time fully to meditation and silent contemplation. The young group also celebrated the birthday of Ramakrishna in the company of Niranjananda, who delivered a lecture on the life and message of Ramakrishna. The study circle participants would also read the works of Vivekananda. Kalyanananda, a direct disciple of Vivekananda, who had dedicated himself to service for humanity visited Benares at this time. From him Kedarnath learnt about the philosophy of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda, of serving the God in humanity. The service work by the group began with the treatment of a poor old lady on the verge of death lying on the roadside, who was given proper medical attention and other care. The money was obtained by begging. Kedarnath next traveled to Haridwar to be with Niranjananda who was leading an austere life. Niranjananda had to return to Calcutta and Kedarnath continued his spiritual practices in Haridwar. He used to beg his food from an alms house and spent two and half months in solitude. Next he went to Calcutta upon request from Niranjananda to take his care during his illness. There he met Brahmananda, another direct disciple of Ramakrishna and the first president of the Belur Math. Brahmananda had told him that slight spiritual practices would fetch results for him. He also met Saradananda, the writer of the magnum opus Ramakrishna, the Great Master, and a direct disciple of Ramakrishna in the house of Balaram Bose. He also met Mahendranath Gupta or M, the chronicler of The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna. After returning to Benares, Kedarnath, on advice from Niranjananda went to Jayrambati to meet Sarada Devi and spent about two months with her. He also went to Kamarpukur, the birthplace of Ramakrishna. Sarada Devi had told him that he was going to become a monk. He then returned to Benares on 12 June 1900. In his absence the Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service was established by his friends Charuchandra Das (Shubhananda) and Jamini Ranjan Majumdar, both disciples of Vivekananda. They took care of the hapless pilgrims who were often exploited by local priests and landlords and treated the sick, who otherwise had to die on the roadside. The organization's motto was serving God in every human being selflessly, in line with the practical Vedanta philosophy propounded by Vivekananda. In the beginning the organization was named as Poor Men's Relief Association, but later the name was changed to Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service under request from Vivekananda himself. In 1902 Vivekananda had come to Benares and had inspired the group of young men further to dedicate themselves to serve the poor and needy sans any ego and desire. On 13 September 1900, a house for the hospital was rented for Rs 5/- per month and all activities were conducted from this house. The group of young men including Kedarnath did all the work, including cleaning the toilets, themselves. A working committee, of which Kedarnath was also a member was established under the presidency of Pramadadas Mitra, a great benefactor and well wisher of Vivekananda. At this time, the spiritual and the service work of Kedarnath had earned displeasure of his relatives and his father disowned him. As a result, Kedarnath renounced worldly life. Kedarnath went to help Swami Kalyanananda in the latter's famine relief work in Kishangarh, but his health suffered under the strain of the work. When the relief work ended, Kedarnath returned to Benares after visiting Jaipur, Virndavan and Allahabad. At this time Swami Vivekananda had returned to India and Kedarnath went to Belur Math to meet him in October 1901. Swami Brahmananda introduced him to Swami Vivekananda. He also witnessed the first Durga Puja in Belur Math. He stayed in Belur Math in the company of Vivekananda for about nine months. Vivekananda told Kedarnath, You will not have to do any spiritual practice. You will attain spiritual realization spontaneously. He used to call him affectionately as Kedar Baba. Vivekananda initiated Kedarnath on the occasion of the birthday celebration of Buddha. He was given the name of Achalananda. He was the last monastic disciple of Vivekananda. ==Monastic life== Swami Vivekananda had received a grant of Rs 500/- from Raja of Bhinga to be used for dissemination of Vedanta. He gave the amount to Swami Shivananda and Swami Achalananda to start an Ashrama in Varanasi in June 1902. On 4 July 1902, they established the Sri Ramakrishna Advaita Ashrama in Benares. On the same day, Swami Vivekananda died in Calcutta. In 1904 Swami Achalananda was sent to the Ramakrishna Math in Madras to work under Swami Ramakrishnananda. He worked there for eleven months and then returned to Benares. In 1908, the new sevashrama hospital commenced in Luxa. Achalananda supervised the construction of the hospital. The buildings were consecrated by Swami Brahmananda in 1910. Swami Brahmananda then set Swami Achalananda free to pursue his spiritual practices, shunning active work. Achalananda was also in Kothar, in company of the holy mother Sri Sarada Devi. He stayed in Puri in company of Swami Brahmananda and in 1912 he visited Ramakrishna Mission Sevashrama Kankhal. When the holy mother Sri Sarada Devi visited the Ramakrishna Mission Home of Service, Achalananda showed her the hospital.Ramakrishna Mission Varanasi On 24 August 1910, Achalananda was elected as one of the trustees of Ramakrishna Order.p291. He retired from active life in 1914. The rest of his life was spent in spreading the ideals of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda and in pursuing spiritual austerities. In February 1916 he accompanied Swami Visuddhananda to Jayrambati to meet Sri Sarada Devi. His health was shattered by severe austerities despite the instructions of Swami Brahmananda to the contrary. In November 1938 Swami Achalananda became the vice president of Ramakrishna Math and Mission. However he maintained the same austere lifestyle. He was respected as a great spiritual figure among the devotees and monks and he guided them towards spiritual life. He entreated young men to dedicate their lives for living the ideals of Swami Vivekananda. In his speech delivered at the Monk's conference held at Belur Math in 1946 he urged the monks to embrace love in performing all their work as it is one of the strong foundations of Ramakrishna Order. He also emphasized on spirituality as the life force of Ramakrishna Order and therefore strongly urged the monks to follow serious spiritual practices along with the regular work. He would address even junior monks and young men as \\"brother\\" even when he was the vice president. The repayment of debt that Belur Math had incurred for the construction of Sri Ramakrishna temple was of great concern and he would even give away a part of the money given to him by devotees to the purpose of repayment of the debt. He suffered much from physical ailments during his last few years. He developed asthma and other ailments, and died in Benares on 11 March 1947. ==Further reading== * Abjajananda Swami, Monastic Disciples of Swami Vivekananda, Advaita Ashrama, Mayavati, 2003, ==References== Category:Ramakrishna Mission Category:Swami Vivekananda Category:Monastic disciples of Swami Vivekananda Category:Hindu sages Category:1876 births Category:1947 deaths Category:Monks of the Ramakrishna Mission ","title":"Achalananda"},{"id":"41965811","text":"is a Japanese screenwriter. ==Selected works== *Ultraman: Towards the Future (1992) *Spellbound (1999) ‚Äî Nominated: Japan Academy Prize for best screenplay *Ultraman Cosmos (2002) *Lorelei: The Witch of the Pacific Ocean (2005) *Neuro: Supernatural Detective (2007) *Top Secret: The Revelation (2008) *Nobody to Watch Over Me (2008) ‚Äî Best screenplay at Montreal World Film Festival *Sequence \\"No Longer Human\\" in Aoi Bungaku (2009) *The Incite Mill (2010) *Chihayafuru (2011-2012) *Ultraman Z (2020) ==References *Official site (in Japanese) * Category:Japanese screenwriters Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Satoshi Suzuki"},{"id":"41965825","text":"Zatrephes elegans is a moth of the family Erebidae.

The murder is notable because of the claim by one of the killers, Miranda Barbour, that she had murdered at least 22 other people, triggering worldwide news coverage of the case. ==Murder== The couple met Troy LaFerrara through an ad on Craigslist, where Miranda offered to have sex with him in exchange for payment. Elytte has publicly denied that Miranda is a sex worker. He said that she met men that paid her for \\"delightful conversation.\\" Miranda has stated that she agreed to meet LaFerrara for sex, charging $100. On November 11, 2013, Miranda allegedly met LaFerrara at the Susquehanna Valley Mall parking lot in Hummels Wharf, Pennsylvania. After settling on payment, Miranda and LaFerrara then drove six miles to Sunbury, a small city located about 100 miles northwest of Philadelphia. Elytte Barbour told police that he hid under a blanket in the backseat waiting. After she allowed LaFerrara into her vehicle, Miranda signaled to Elytte, who jumped out and wrapped a cord around LaFerrara's neck as Miranda stabbed him 20 times in their Honda CR-V. LaFerrara's body was discovered the next day, November 12, 2013, in a residential backyard in Sunbury. Police said after Miranda and Elytte dumped LaFerrara's body, the couple then bought bleach wipes, towels, and cleaning liquid to remove the blood from inside the vehicle and then went to dinner. According to the arrest affidavit, Elytte said the couple killed LaFerrara because they just wanted to murder someone together. According to police, the Barbours initially denied even knowing LaFerrara, but police traced the last call from LaFerrara's phone to Miranda's phone. As the investigation developed, the couple's stories allegedly changed from Miranda's story of self-defense to a mutual confession to premeditated murder. The killing allegedly was a thrill killing, timed for three weeks after the couple's wedding, police have said. Miranda Barbour, 19, and Elytte Barbour, 22, had previously pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder charges that carried a possible death penalty upon conviction. They changed their pleas to guilty of second-degree murder at what was to have been a routine status conference in Northumberland County Court in Sunbury. == Perpetrators  Miranda Barbour === In an interview with the Sunbury Daily Item, Miranda Barbour claimed she was molested by a relative at the age of four. Barbour's mother confirmed that Miranda's uncle was charged with sexual abuse of a minor and sentenced to 14 years in prison. Barbour claimed that she joined a satanic cult at the age of 13 and soon after committed her first murder when the cult leader forced her to shoot a man indebted to their cult. She claimed to be responsible for the deaths of \\"at least 22 people\\" between 2008 and 2013. This claim triggered worldwide media attention and led to investigations of the claim by the FBI and other police forces. A Northumberland County District Attorney told The Daily Item that he was skeptical of Miranda's claims, saying \\"We have been in contact with other law enforcement agencies where she has lived and haven't received any information verifying what she said.\\"Satanic serial killer? DA skeptical about Miranda Barbour's claims she killed more than 20 others, Mark Gilger, The Daily Item, 17 February 2014 The Alaska State Troopers released a statement saying they have no evidence Barbour committed any murders during her time in Alaska.Troopers: No evidence Miranda Barbour linked to Alaska killings , Michelle Theriault Boots, Anchorage Daily News, Feb. 18, 2014 === Elytte Barbour === Elytte Barbour graduated from Triton High School in 2010. He married Miranda (n√©e Dean) on October 22, 2013 when they were residing in Dunn, North Carolina. On September 18, 2014, both were sentenced to life without parole. ==See also== * Internet homicide ==References== https://huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/26/miranda-barbour-elytte-ba_n_5718033.html Category:2013 in Pennsylvania Category:2013 murders in the United States Category:Cybercrime Category:Male murder victims Category:Murder in Pennsylvania Category:November 2013 crimes Category:November 2013 events in the United States Category:Violence against men in North America Category:Sunbury, Pennsylvania ","title":"Murder of Troy LaFerrara"},{"id":"41965859","text":"HD 185435 is a star in the constellation Cygnus.

Mills Kelly's course ‚Äì \\"Lying about the past\\", have created two popular hoaxes: the \\"Edward Owens hoax,\\" and the \\"Reddit serial killer hoax.\\" It is a goal of the course to create a sweeping internet deception. As Prof. Kelly stated in the course's syllabus: ==Edward Owens hoax== The Edward Owens hoax was a historical hoax created by students at George Mason University in 2008 as a class project for \\"Lying About the Past\\". The students created a website and a fictitious entry on English Wikipedia about Edward Owens, purportedly a Virginia oyster fisherman born in 1853 who became a pirate. The hoax was reported as true in some media outlets. ===Hoax description=== Students published a blog and videos about the fictional Owens, created by the fictional student \\"Jane Browning\\". The blog asserted that Owens fell on hard times during the Long Depression of the 1870s and took up piracy in Chesapeake Bay to survive. The students wrote that he robbed smaller commercial vessels and wealthy pleasure boaters from Maryland using a punt gun to threaten his victims. The class created a fake will, which asserted that Owens and his crew eventually went back to oyster fishing. The students later created a hoax biography of Owens on Wikipedia. After some media outlets and academics reported the hoax as factual, the class divulged the hoax.Matheson, Whitney. Pop Candy blog, USAToday.com, December 4, 2008\\"The Last American Pirate\\", December 4, 2008 ==Reddit serial killer hoax== The Reddit serial killer hoax was a second historical hoax perpetrated by \\"Lying about the past\\" class members. This one quickly failed, unlike the Owens hoax. In 2012, Professor Kelly taught the course for a second time in a similar format. The Reddit hoax, about an alleged serial killer named Joseph Scafe, was launched on the Reddit site on 28 April, and was first debunked in just over an hour. ===Hoax description=== The participating students created a sockpuppet named Lisa Quinn, and under her name opened a Wordpress.com blog entitled: \\"I think my uncle was a serial killer.\\" In her blog, Lisa wrote that she found some odd items in a Saratoga steamer trunk that she received upon the death of her grandparents. Lisa posted pictures of the trunk; ladies shoes she presumably found inside the trunk; and newspaper clippings from 1895; one of which was about the murder of Alice Walsh‚Äîlater identified as having been taken from the April 22, 1895 edition of The Evening World. According to Lisa's post, the trunk belonged to a relative, Joseph Scafe, (also called 'Uncle Joe'), and that it contained‚Äîin a false panel‚Äîladies' jewelry and a \\"disturbing\\" journal. Lisa supposedly wanted to know if‚Äîin the opinion of her readers‚Äîher uncle was a serial killer. With a new sockpuppet, DisturbedThrowaway, the students attempted to start the spread of the hoax with a posting of a question on AskReddit: \\"Do you think my uncle Joe was just weird or possibly a serial killer?\\" Through Reddit, the hoax was expected to spread. At first, the hoax aroused interest. Many posters requested more photos (which DisturbedThrowaway declined) and alluded to the commercial success the case could lead to. The name of Jack the Ripper was mentioned as well. Yet, within 26 minutes, suspicions were rising. DisturbedThrowaway, the poster of the question, claimed to have found the names of two victims, Alice Walsh and Diamond Flossie, in the documents she retrieved. She asked the redditors for assistance in research; however, a quick Wikipedia search brought forth information connected with the two names, and posters at the site wondered why DisturbedThrowaway hadn't performed such a simple search herself. ===Discovery=== Just over an hour after the initial posting, HatesRedditors suggested that the post was viral marketing. He noted that the Wikipedia entries for the victims had been created within two weeks of the posting and the pictures in the articles looked faked. The students tried to keep the deception going for several weeks, but the story was exposed. On May 14, Kelly revealed the serial killer hoax on his blog. ==Aftermath== With the latest hoax exposed, Wikipedia deleted the two entries about Alice Walsh and Diamond Flossie which had been written by the students‚Äô sockpuppets. The professor and students claimed that the subjects were factual, but Wikipedia found them to be of insufficient notability. Wikipedia administrators did raise questions about the course's situational ethics, however, as some claimed that Professor Kelly legitimized Wikipedia vandalism. Professor Kelly did not express regret in this matter, \\"I don't think there were any real victims here\\", he blogged: ==Results== Yoni Appelbaum wrote in The Atlantic an article, \\"How the Professor Who fooled Wikipedia Got Caught by Reddit,\\" in which he compared the serial killer hoax and the last pirate hoax. In his article, he wondered why the 2008 hoax was successful, while this hoax failed in minutes. One answer he suggested was that Wikipedia has a trusting community, while Reddit has a critical and skeptical community. In March 2013, Kelly announced that he would no longer be teaching the course, after the university declined to make it part of the regular curriculum of his department, however, as of February 2015 Professor Kelly continues to delve into topics dealing with editing and/or manipulating Wikipedia in his digital history classHistory 390 Digital History Class at George Mason University.The Digital Past 2015 ==See also== *List of hoaxes ==References *Hoax web site created by George Mason University class *Blog entry about the hoax by Mills Kelly, the professor teaching the course, December 18, 2008 * Category:2008 hoaxes Category:2008 in the United States Owens Category:History of Wikipedia Category:Hoaxes in the United States Category:Internet hoaxes Category:2012 hoaxes Category:George Mason University Category:Wikipedia controversies Category:2012 in the United States Category:Reddit ","title":"George Mason University's historical hoaxes"},{"id":"41965873","text":"The Champanel grape is an American hybrid developed by Thomas Volney Munson of Texas. Champanel is a cross of the two grape varieties Vitis champinii X Worden, a Concord seedling. It grows vigorously, is resistant to root rot, Pierces disease and produces clusters of fruit resistant to rot and mildew. Although well adapted to a wide range of growing conditions, Champanel produces fruit with aroma characteristic of its Concord parentage and is not often seen commercially. Rather, Champanel is most often used as grafting material for Vitis vinifera (wine grapes), to provide disease resistant root stock. Jim Kamas writes, \\"Although the cause of vine death from [Pierce disease] was not known to him, T.V. Munson realized that utilizing grape parents that survived local conditions was important in creating new, improved adapted grape varieties\\" (Power). Munson not only developed a hybrid grape that is resistant to Pierce disease but that grows well in any soil type. The Champanel grapevine grows vigorously on any type of trellis it is placed under. The vine can be placed beside a fence so that the arms of the vine can run along it. Even though the vine grows vigorously, the Champanel grapevine is great for first time growers who want to add grapevines to their garden for the berries or for aesthetics. With the berries a grower can make jelly, juice or wine. This vine is excellent for growing up an arbor to provide shade in a growers back or front yard. ==Disease resistance and Tolerances== The clusters are loose, so plenty of air can blow between the berries to dry them from the morning dew or from a heavy rain. The loose bunches help to prevent Bunch rot, Powdery mildew and Downy mildew. Champanel grapes are also not susceptible to Pierce‚Äôs disease, which is a disease caused by the glassy-winged sharpshooter. This insect is native to southeast United States. The sharpshooter has the \\"ability to spread Xylella fsatidoisa, the bacterium that causes Pierce‚Äôs disease\\" (Power 148). The Champanel grapevine can thrive in the hot humid south and can tolerate temperatures 15 to 20 degrees below zero (Munson). This vine has a good resistance to disease and because of its ability to grow in any soil type the Champanel vine is an excellent choice for graft wood. ==Vine growth: Foliage, Cane and Arms== The Champanel grapevine grows vigorously starting from early spring to later summer in to early fall, so there is no need to fertilize them more than twice. These two applications should be given when the foliage starts to grow and when the berries are about pea size. However, if the grapes are growing in rich soil one application may suffice. The leaves are large and comparatively rough, so insects are not as interested in them. The cane grows upright on the trellis with the arms extending out as far as they are allowed to grow. With these vines pruning is important if the grower‚Äôs desire is to maximize fruit production and quality. ==Description of Berries == Berries are large and black and hang in small clusters which resemble the Concord grape. Unlike the thick tough skin of the Concord grape, the Champanel grape has thin tough skin (Munson). The thin skin along with its tender pulp allows the Champanel grape to be an excellent table grape. ==Ripening== In mid spring white blooms appear on the vine and in midsummer about the same time as the Concord grape ripens the Champanel grape ripens. However, the Champanel will not have the early dropping of fruit or the uneven ripening as the Concord grapes do. The uneven ripening is not a small problem because grapes do not ripen after they are picked from the vine. The early ripen is also significant because the berry moth can be problematic especially for late season grapes. The adult moth lays eggs on the fruit or near the fruit; when the larvae hatch they are of course worm-like. They bore their way into the fruit and eat from berry to berry. These insects have generally three generations a growing season, but in the south and west they can have four (Teixeira). However, the Champanel grapes will only face at the most one to two generations that can be managed with pheromone traps. ==References== Munson, Thomas Volney. Foundations of American Grape Culture.

Sekaquaptewa used colorful stones and shell for his Hopi silver overlay, not only plain silver decorated with chisel strokes on black oxide surfaces, a Hopi-signature technique known as matting.Jacka, Jerry: Art of the Hopi , Flagstaff, Arizona: Northland Publishers, 1998. He was born in 1948 in a traditional Hopi village on Second Mesa on the Hopi Reservation, located in Northern Arizona. He learned his cultural heritage as a resident Hopi and then began silversmithing, taking up the tools after his uncle, Emory. Sekaquaptewa is internationally known for his contemporary and idiosyncratic designs which incorporate traditional Hopi pottery designs with contemporary flush stonework and inlay of bone and shell in blocky, masculine style. He does other styles as well, but the rectangular- themed composite rugged silver/stonework is his artistic signature and makes his work instantly recognizable to anyone who has encountered it before, not only experts. Sekaquaptewa died of cancer on January 21, 2003. == Career == Sekaquaptewa was a 1973 graduate of Northern Arizona University with a bachelor of Fine Arts degree and a master's degree from the University of Arizona, 1974. He gained interest in the field of jewelry from his father Wayne and from his uncle Emory Sekaquaptewa, the linguist and silversmith as well, who co-founded the Hopi Gallery on the Third Mesa, Arizona. In the early 1970s he trained in the art of traditional silver overlay jewelry at Hopicrafts, a business owned by his father and uncle Emory. Sekaquaptewa won awards for his unique silver designs at the most prestigious American Indian Art competitions in the U.S., including Red Earth, Oklahoma City, Santa Fe Indian Market, Santa Fe, New Mexico, The Hopi Show, Museum of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff, Heard Museum Indian Fair in Phoenix, Arizona, Indian Ceremonial, held annually in Gallup, New Mexico, and many others. His work has also been published and featured in Southwest Art, American Indian Art, Native Peoples' Magazine, Beyond Tradition, and is described in a book by Jerry Jacka titled Art of the Hopi, the definitive guide to silversmiths, weavers, potters, and kachina doll-makers of the Hopi Nation, also authored by Jacka, Magazine of the Southwest, and several times in Arizona Highways magazine. During the height of the Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute, he did political cartoons for the Hopi weekly newspaper Qua 'Toqti.Koehler, Rhiannon M. 2019 Two Nations, Indivisible: Unity, Discord, and the Cartoons of the Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute, 1973-1974. The Journal of Arizona History 60(2):183-216. == Art and residence == Bolo tie circa 1988. Private collection of Hopi silver overlay of Marek Wojciech ≈Åugowski (Lugowski) Sekaquaptewa used a unique combination of traditional silver or gold overlay with contemporary design of his own. Combined, his jewelry comprises stylized or preserved traditional Hopi pottery motifs, as well as lapidary texture and color inserted through the use of semi-precious stones and abalone shell. Using stone and shell is unusual for Hopi silversmiths, and is more typical of the Zuni and other Pueblo people, as well as the ethnographically disjoint Din√© (Navajo) silversmiths‚Äîusually turquoise. In sum, the main features are sterling silver, stones, and contemporary design of his authorship, all applied in a synthetic blend as new Hopi jewelry. Sekaquaptewa resided at the village of Sipaulovi (or Supawlavi) on Second Mesa in Northern Arizona, and worked at his Weseoma Studio. He lived with his family: daughter Caroline, son Wayne, and two family dogs Drexler and Bambi. He assiduously attended the children's sporting events, practiced golf extensively, and was an accomplished fly-fishing sports fisherman. He was a member of the Eagle clan, as well as on his distaff side, the Snake clan. As befits a resident Hopi, in that obligatory capacity Sekaquaptewa participated actively in observances obligatory under the traditional Hopi calendar, which comprises various public and restricted attendance ceremonies. Sekaquaptewa worked towards the preservation of the Hopi language and the Hopi tradition, while funding his Nation and making a living by creating new contemporary art uniquely informed by his heritage, silver apprenticeship, artistic creativity, and academic training. == Major exhibitions == * The Hopi Show, Museum of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff * annual: Heard Museum Indian Fair, Phoenix * annual: Indian Ceremonial, Gallup * annual: Santa Fe Indian Market, Santa Fe, New Mexico == Bibliography == * Jacka, Jerry: Art of the Hopi , Flagstaff, Arizona: Northland Publishers, 1998.

Housework may include a variety of activities, particularly those traditionally associated with housekeeping (or homemaking), along with child care and nurturing. These activities have recognizable economic and social significance, but are not included in standard economic measurements, such as the gross domestic product (GDP). While the symbolic or subjective benefits of housework are difficult to measure, various attempts have been made to attach value to economically productive household activity. ==Economic ValuationTracking Measures=== Traditional means of tracking economic activity, such as the gross domestic product (GDP), do not take account of non-exchange, nonmarket household activity. Therefore, various adjustments to GDP calculations and novel measurements have been proposed, such as the GPI or GHP. Gross domestic product (GDP) In 2012, the US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) created an adjusted measure of GDP to account for productive household activity. By using detailed time use surveys for the period 1965-2010, the BEA found that incorporating ‚Äúnonmarket household production‚Äù raises the GDP measure by 39% in 1965 and 26% in 2010. The surveys used seven categories of time use in American household production (housework, cooking, odd jobs, gardening, shopping, child care, and domestic travel) and the BEA assigned a low-end market wage to the hours spent on each activity. The declining impact on the adjusted GDP reflects the steadily decreasing number of (nonmarket) hours households spent on home production. While men increased their weekly hours of home production in the time span from 14 to 17, this increase was more than offset by the decline in women's home production from 40 to 26 hours. The BEA explains this shift by increased women's participation in the work force as well as the steadily decreasing market wages of household workers (such as cleaners and nannies), raising the opportunity costs of self-participation and encouraging outsourcing. Genuine progress indicator (GPI) The GPI is an alternative to GDP as a measure of economic growth that is generally designed to incorporate environmental and social factors that are not traditionally included. While much of the focus is typically placed on environmental costs, most GPI measurements explicitly include additions for the value of household work and parenting. One of the most well-known examples is the GPI measure used across Atlantic Canada. In a 1999 report GPI Atlantic describes the household production infrastructure as akin to the access to raw materials, labour and markets required for the business sector. The Atlantic GPI employs time use variables and assigns explicit monetary values to unpaid work according to its replacement value in the market. According to their (1999) measurements, ‚Äúunpaid work contributes $325 billion worth of services to the Canadian economy annually‚Äù and they argue that GPI analysis should be explicitly incorporated into policy considerations. Gross household product (GHP) Gross household product is a specific estimation of the economic value added by the unpaid work and capital of households. It does not include many of the additional factors typically included in GPI determinations but focuses specifically on the ‚Äúhousehold economy.‚Äù Duncan Ironmonger defines a country's Gross Economic Product as comprising both the Gross Market Product (typically defined as GDP) and Gross Household Product. Using one of the same time use surveys as the BEA study referenced above (the American Time Use Survey), Ironmonger estimates the USA's 2011 GHP at 11.6 trillion dollars (as compared to a GDP of 13.3 trillion). Approaches to the Economic Valuation of Housework The OECD report Cooking, Caring and Volunteering: Unpaid Work Around the World defines unpaid work as, ‚Äúthe production of goods and services by household members that are not sold on the market‚Äù . It uses the ‚Äúthird-person‚Äù rule to distinguish between work and leisure, claiming that if a third person can be paid to do the activity while benefiting the household, it is work. While paid work outside of the home is readily measurable, housework is much more difficult to calculate. A number of models have been created to determine the value of work in the home, each with different conceptualizations of the process. There is currently no consensus on the appropriate approach. These methods are generally divided into two main camps: the opportunity cost approach and the market value approach. The former views housework as equivalent to the amount one would make in the labour market. Housework is therefore evaluated at the wage rate that the member would otherwise have received. The market value approach bases the value of work done in the home on the cost of hiring someone to do the same job. Neither method is without criticism. The opportunity cost method is flawed in that it is difficult to pinpoint a comparator group. Not all workers have their choice of job, nor the number of hours they work. Furthermore, wages vary depending on the location of the job and the gender of the employee, and the time it takes to get to and from work is not factored into the calculation. Age, level of education, and work experience are good predictors of what one would make in the labour market, but they are simply a subset of the aspects that can be used to calculate what a house worker would make. Therefore, while many studies regarding the valuation of work in the home have attempted to come up with a standard wage and multiply it by the number of hours worked, there is no agreement as to how this standard wage should be determined. The market value approach comes with its own set of flaws. One type of approach within this category is the Direct Output Method, which is based on the value of production rather than the hours of labour performed in the household. It solves the problem of having to come up with a standard wage, but it is inherently difficult to obtain data on production output (e.g., number of pants folded) in the home. Furthermore, comparing the value of individual tasks performed to the average market price it would cost to get that same task completed may not be accurate, as multiple tasks can and are often done simultaneously in the home. To counteract this problem, one can construct a valuation based on the total wages of a housekeeper who performs a similar set of tasks. Yet, even then, the model does not take into account that men and women in the labour market often do housework, but hire housekeepers to do specific jobs that may require particular skills or expertise and demand a higher wage as a result. Overall, while these methods have attempted to create ways to determine the value of household labour, there is no accepted approach. ===Gender Disparity=== Despite women's increased participation in the work force, several North American studies show that women still engage in significantly more housework activity than men. A recent study by Statistics Canada indicates that while men and women participate (nearly) equally in the labour force, women spend far more hours on unpaid housework, such as child care and domestic work (including house cleaning, cooking, yard work and home maintenance). For example, it was found that men spend an average of 24.4 hours per week on child care, while women spend 50.1 hours on the same tasks. In the domestic work category, men conduct 8.3 hours of unpaid work, compared with 13.8 hours per week for women. According to GPI Atlantic, ‚Äú[t]ime use surveys reveal that Canadian women spend about twice as much time on total unpaid household work, including child and elder care, as men. They spend three times as long cooking and washing dishes, and nearly seven times as much time cleaning house and doing laundry‚Äù. This is despite a doubling of the female labour force from 1960-1999. The report argues that due to the invisibility of unpaid household production in traditional economic measures (like GDP), women are subject to wage and gender discrimination that has significant adverse effects on their economic well- being. By contrast, the US Department of Commerce Bureau of Economic Analysis found a smaller discrepancy between genders on productive (but nonmarket) housework. According to their May 2012 report, women spend approximately 26 hours per week on home production, as opposed to 17 hours for men. Note, however, that the tasks included vary significantly between studies. ==References== Category:Home economics ","title":"Valuation of Nonmarket Housework"},{"id":"41966059","text":"Poecilosoma eusebia is a moth of the subfamily Arctiinae.

The aircraft, an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 767-300ER, was hijacked by the unarmed co-pilot, Hailemedhin Abera Tegegn, en route from Addis Ababa to Rome, and landed at Geneva. All 202 passengers and crew were unharmed. Hailemedhin was arrested by the Swiss authorities, and after being convicted in absentia by an Ethiopian court, was granted asylum in Switzerland in May 2016. ==Incident== Flight 702 was scheduled to depart from Addis Ababa Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, at 00:30 EAT (UTC+3) on 17 February 2014. The aircraft's transponder began to emit squawk 7500 ‚Äî the international code for an aircraft hijacking ‚Äî while flying north over Sudan. When the pilot exited the cockpit to use the restroom, the co- pilot locked the cockpit door and continued to fly the aircraft. The flight was scheduled to arrive at Leonardo da Vinci‚ÄìFiumicino Airport in Rome, Italy, at 04:40 CET (UTC+1), before continuing to Malpensa Airport in Milan, Italy. Instead, the aircraft was flown to Geneva, Switzerland, where the co-pilot circled several times while communicating with air traffic control at Geneva International Airport while trying to negotiate political asylum for himself and an assurance that he would not be extradited to Ethiopia. At 06:02 CET (UTC+1), the airplane landed at Geneva International Airport with about 10 minutes of fuel remaining, and having suffered the flameout of one engine. The co-pilot exited the aircraft by scaling down a rope he threw out of the cockpit window before walking over to police; he surrendered after identifying himself as the hijacker, and was taken into custody. The airport was briefly shut down during the incident; no passengers or crew were injured.Larry Register, Co-pilot hijacks Ethiopian Airlines plane, flies to Geneva, seeks asylum, CNN (18 February 2014). The flight was escorted by Italian Eurofighter and French Mirage fighter jets while traversing their respective airspaces. The Swiss Air Force did not respond because the incident occurred outside normal office hours, which are 08:00‚Äì12:00 and 13:30‚Äì17:00 Monday to Friday; a Swiss Air Force spokesman stated: \\"Switzerland cannot intervene because its airbases are closed at night and on the weekend. It's a question of budget and staffing.\\" Switzerland relies on neighboring countries to police its airspace outside of regular business hours; the French and Italian Air Forces have permission to escort suspicious flights into Swiss airspace, but do not have authority to shoot down an aircraft over Switzerland. ==ConsequencesHijacker=== The hijacker of Flight 702 was Hailemedhin Abera Tegegn, 31, who was the co-pilot of flight 702.Swiss confirm Ethiopian plane hijack , BBC News, 17 February 2014 Last updated at 01:44 ET. In May 2014, the Swiss government declined a request by the Ethiopian government to extradite Hailemedhin to Ethiopia. Swiss authorities initially said that Hailemedhin would face trial in Switzerland. However, in November 2015, the Swiss public prosecutor determined that Hailemedhin (who had been detained in Switzerland ever since his arrest) would not be prosecuted after a panel of experts \\"unanimously decided that [Hailemedhin] was in a state of complete paranoia\\" during the hijacking and was incapable of rational thinking.Caroline Bishop, 'Paranoid' hijack pilot faces no Swiss charges, The Local (13 November 2015). Hailemedhin was then set to appear before a Swiss federal court, which would order the pilot to undergo mental health treatment. In March 2015, the Ethiopian high court in Addis Ababa convicted Hailemedhin in absentia and sentenced him to 19 years and six months in jail. ===Swiss Air Force=== The limitations of Switzerland's air defences were made apparent by this incident. Although a proposal to improve coverage was already in motion, the hijacking led to the implementation of a 24-hour readiness organisation. From 4 January 2016, a pair of Swiss F/A-18 Hornets were kept at 15 minute QRA readiness between 8.00am and 6.00pm on weekdays. This was increased as of 2 January 2017 to the same hours daily. By the end of 2020, the Swiss Air Force will maintain a pair of interceptors at 15 minute readiness 24 hours a day for 365 days a year.Praesentation Aufbau Luftpolizeidienst 24hhttp://www.20min.ch/schweiz/news/story/Kampfjets-fliegen-naechstes-Jahr- bis-18-Uhr-20057467 ==See also== *Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961 ==NotesReferences== Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2014 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Switzerland Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Boeing 767 Category:2014 in Switzerland Category:2014 in Ethiopia Category:Aircraft hijackings 702 Category:Aircraft hijackings in Africa ","title":"Ethiopian Airlines Flight 702"},{"id":"41966062","text":"Gymnelia felderi is a moth of the subfamily Arctiinae.

It is a monotypic genus and the only species is Stylaraea punctata. This coral is native to shallow tidal pools in tropical parts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. ==Description== Stylaraea punctata is probably the smallest of the zooxanthellate corals, being circular, encrusting, and usually less than in diameter. The polyps are flower-like and less than across, each having twelve tentacles. The cup-shaped corallites in which they sit have a solid central columella and poorly-developed calcareous septa in two whorls of six. The colouring of this coral is usually pale brown or purple with white septa and columella. ==Distribution and habitat== Stylaraea punctata is known from widely separated locations in the tropical Indo-Pacific region including East Africa, the Seychelles, Indonesia, the Great Barrier Reef and Guam. It is possible that it is present in other locations as it is easily overlooked. Its habitat is shallow tidal pools seldom more than half a metre deep, just above the sediment and hidden under dead pieces of coral or under massive coralline algae. In these locations it suffers little competition from other coral species. ==Status== The IUCN lists Stylaraea punctata as \\"Data deficient\\" as it has insufficient evidence to judge its status and whether any conservation measures are required. Like other corals, this species is likely to be affected by such factors as a rise in sea temperature and ocean acidification due to climate change, and as a result be more susceptible to coral diseases. ==References== Category:Poritidae Category:Taxa named by Henri Milne-Edwards Category:Cnidarian genera Category:Taxa named by Jules Haime ","title":"Stylaraea"},{"id":"41966116","text":"Montana's at-large congressional district The 2014 congressional election in Montana was held on November 4, 2014, to determine who will represent the state of Montana in the United States House of Representatives.

Its Bengali original was written by Swami Saradananda, which is based on interviews of persons who knew or interacted with him. It is therefore a first-hand source. The original Bengali version published was composed in five volumes and was the first full-scale biography of the saint. This is an eye witness account and therefore carries more credibility than later books on Sri Ramakrishna. The English translation was first published in 1952. The original Bengali book was written from 1909 to 1919, over a period of ten years in order to repay the debt incurred for constructing Udbodhan House for Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi.Reminiscences of Swami Saradanandaji, by Swami Bhuteshananda, Sri Ramakrishna Bhavadarsha, Udbodhan Publishers, Kolkata ==History== Saradananda was one of the direct monastic disciples of Sri Ramakrishna and was the first Secretary of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission. He first met Ramakrishna when he was in his teens and started writing the book almost two decades after the death of Ramakrishna in 1886. Besides Gospel of Ramakrishna, it is considered a major biographical source. However, this biography and later biographies by his disciples have been \\"heavily influenced by the later systematic reinterpretation\\" of the tradition, and should therefore be used \\"with critical caution\\" and \\"checked against the recorded sayings\\".The Transformation of Sri Ramakrisha, Walter Neevel, In: Hinduism: New Essays in the History of Religions, Bardwell L. Smith. The original Bengali book was translated to English by Swami Jagadananda in 1952 and published by Sri Ramakrishna Math Chennai. This is the original and most complete biography of Sri Ramakrishna. More recently, another English translation has been brought out by Swami Chetanananda, named Sri Ramakrishna and His Divine Play. ==Overview== The book is made up of two parts. Part 1 of the book deals with the early life of Sri Ramakrishna, including his birth and childhood and his spiritual practices, while part 2 deals with Sri Ramakrishna as a spiritual teacher, his relationship with Narendranath Dutta, later Swami Vivekananda, and the later stages of his life. ==ReferencesExternal== * , Category:Ramakrishna Category:Indian biographies Category:Translations into English Category:1952 non-fiction books Category:Indian non-fiction books Category:20th-century Indian books ","title":"Sri Ramakrishna, the Great Master"},{"id":"41966169","text":"Harald Lindberg, 1904 Harald Lindberg (2 November 1871, Helsinki ‚Äì 13 March 1963, Helsinki) was a Finnish botanist of Swedish parentage.

Bankes and her family moved from Hemel Hempstead to Puy-Saint-Vincent in the southern Alps in 1999. She had already started skiing by this time, having first tried it at the age of two, but took up snowboarding in the footsteps of her brothers William and Thomas, who have both also competed in the sport internationally. She started competing internationally for France in 2010. The following year she sustained a pelvis fracture in a crash, which left her in \\"constant pain\\" and unable to train at full intensity for several years. She made her debut on the FIS Snowboard World Cup a few months before representing France at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. She also competed at the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, where she finished 7th. After the 2018 Games she switched from representing France to competing for Great Britain, in part due to struggling to fully recover from her pelvic injury, despite the French Ski Federation paying for surgery and therapy. She took her first World Cup podium finish for Team GB in a race in Breuil-Cervinia in December 2018, where she pipped her French former team-mate Nelly Moenne-Loccoz to third place. She participated at the FIS Freestyle Ski and Snowboarding World Championships 2019, winning a silver medal in the snowboard cross competition.Snowboard cross results ==ReferencesCategory:1995 births Category:Snowboarders at the 2014 Winter Olympics Category:Snowboarders at the 2018 Winter Olympics Category:Living people Category:Olympic snowboarders of France Category:British female snowboarders Category:Sportspeople from Hemel Hempstead Category:Sportspeople from Hautes-Alpes ","title":"Charlotte Bankes"},{"id":"41966357","text":"Hits FM Music Awards is an annual music awarding event organised by Hits FM in Nepal.http://www.ekantipur.com/2013/08/04/entertainment/nominees-for-hits-fm- music-awards-announced/375864.htmlhttp://www.texasnepal.com/news/17th-hits-fm- music-awards-nominees- announcedhttp://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Hits+FM+Music+Award+nominations&NewsID;=386147 ==References== Category:Nepalese awards ","title":"Hits FM Music Awards"},{"id":"41966371","text":"is a Japanese snowboarder.

Sex Wars premiered on October 2, 2000 and aired its final episode on February 27, 2001. The show was co-hosted by Jennifer Cole and J.D. Roth. The show was produced by Lighthearted Entertainment and distributed by MGM Television and was recorded at CBS Television City in Studio 46. ==Premise== Roth and Cole, in their role as co- hosts, asked questions to their respective gender teams. The men's team was blue, the women's team was pink, and both teams consisted of three members. The audience was also divided appropriately; one side entirely had women sitting on it, while the other side had men. ===Round 1=== The first round consisted of questions with four possible answers, three of which were correct. The wrong answer was called the \\"Land Mine\\". For each correct answer a team uncovered, they received five points. If they managed to come up with all three correct answers, a bonus five points was awarded for a total of twenty for that question. If the Land Mine was picked by any team, their turn ended and five points for each remaining correct answer was given to the opponents. Two questions per side were played. This game mechanic was similar to one used on Trivia Trap in the first half of its run. ===Round 2=== The second round was referred to as \\"The List\\". The show's website conducted a series of surveys for both men and women, with up to ten answers used (a la Family Feud). The two teams alternated back and forth declaring how many answers of the ten they could give (similar to both the Challenge Round on Wipeout and the Bid-A-Note round on Name That Tune). This continued until one team challenged the other or until one of them bid the maximum number of answers. One at a time, the team members would give an answer. Giving a correct answer was worth ten points and moved play to the next player in line. Giving an incorrect answer locked that player out of the rest of the survey. If all three players were locked out, the opposing team could steal the points with giving one of the remaining answers. If the opponents did not, the points went to the team in control. Two categories, with one list each, were played. On some episodes, if there was extra time, one more list would be played with fewer answers. ===Round 3=== The third round was a toss-up question round called \\"Men or Women?\\". Each player was equipped with a buzzer that made strange noises when it was pressed. Roth and Cole would alternate asking questions based on scientific data regarding men and women, with the teams trying to determine who was more likely to do a certain thing. Buzzing in and answering correctly won the points for the team, but buzzing in and answering incorrectly awarded the points to the opponents. Questions were worth ten points up until the final question, which was worth twenty-five (similar to the scoring system used in the second round on The Newlywed Game). On the earliest taped episode, all questions were worth 20 points. ===Round 4=== The fourth and final round saw the teams each trying to answer one more question. The catch was that the men had to answer a question from a category chose by the women while the women had to do the same thing from a category chosen by the men. Both teams were required to wager at least half of their scores on the final question. Answering it correctly added the amount of the wager, while answering it incorrectly deducted it. The team leading after the final question won the game. Members of the winning team split a cash prize, with their total score multiplied by ten and converted into dollars. The top prize, however, was well below what most game shows were offering at that time (Sex Wars offered less than $5,000 cash) and many episodes saw a winning team walk away with less than $100. ==References== Category:2000s American game shows Category:2000 American television series debuts Category:2001 American television series endings Category:Television series by MGM Television Category:English-language television shows ","title":"Sex Wars (game show)"},{"id":"41966543","text":"Pituitrin is a proprietary name for an extract of bovine posterior pituitary hormones (i.e. oxytocin and vasopressin) formerly used in obstetrics and since displaced by purer preparations.http://medical- dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Pituitrin It was used for the induction of labor prior to birth and for the treatment of post-partum hemorrhage (from vasopressin's vasoconstrictive properties).http://jp.physoc.org/content/102/3/274.full.pdf ==References== Category:Hormones ","title":"Pituitrin"},{"id":"41966549","text":"Diego Dionatas Dos Santos or simply Diego (born May 5, 1986 in Valpara√≠so), is a Brazilian goalkeeper, who is currently playing for the Brazilian team Desportivo Brasil.soccerway ==References== Category:Living people Category:1986 births Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Desportivo Brasil players ","title":"Diego Dionatas Dos Santos Oliveira"},{"id":"41966550","text":"Rossiya Tournament 1990 was played in Novosibirsk under the period 26‚Äì31 January 1990, and was won by Sweden.

Though being a farmers' market, it initially supplied vegetables only, as the population of colony grew it also started supplying all kinds of dry goods and wet goods including consumables, metalwares, pots, clothing, furnitures, meat, fish, poultry, livestock and electronic gadgets and miscellaneous items. == Schedule == Initially, the market would be bustling every fortnight and on Sundays from dawn to dusk because the railway employees were paid salaries in cash twice in a month. When the fortnight payment system was scrapped and salaries were given in cash the 3rd day of each month, the market was conducted only on those days, abandoning the biweekly schedule. For the past few years, the market has been open only on Sundays, as the employees' salaries were credited directly into bank accounts. == Legacy == The market square is visited by about 30,000 people from various parts of the district including BHEL Township, OFT, K.

The series stars Kathryn Prescott as Carter Stevens, a teenage girl whose life is torn apart when she discovers that the woman she thought was her mother, Lori (Milena Govich), had in fact abducted her from her family when she was a young child. Cynthia Watros and Alexis Denisof co-star as her real parents, Elizabeth and David Wilson, along with Anna Jacoby-Heron and Zac Pullam as her siblings, Taylor and Grant Wilson. The first season focuses on Carter's return to the Wilson family and her adjustment within friendships and romances, while the second season explores the true motives behind Lori's abduction of Carter as well as focusing on Carter's struggle to belong and as the relationships between her, Taylor and their social group. The first season, which consisted of 12 episodes, finished airing in September 2014. A month after its debut, MTV renewed Finding Carter for a second season of an additional 12 episodes, which was later extended to 24 episodes. The network later cancelled the series in January 2016. ==Plot== The series follows Carter, a teenage girl who has a perfect life with her single mother Lori. After a prank lands Carter in jail, it is revealed that Lori abducted Carter as a child. Now, Carter returns to her original family and she must navigate through her new life while (initially) vowing to be reunited with Lori. However, Carter's mother, Elizabeth, is determined to find Lori and punish the woman responsible for kidnapping her child thirteen years earlier. Meanwhile, Carter's father, David, is secretly writing the sequel to his hit book about Carter's initial disappearance. Along with being reunited with her parents, she meets her goody two-shoes twin sister, Taylor, and ignored younger brother, Grant. ==EpisodesCastMain=== * Kathryn Prescott as Carter Wilson (born Lyndon Wilson, previously Carter Stevens), who was kidnapped at age 3 and is reunited with her birth parents after being arrested. Carter is very rebellious, sneaky and fun-loving. At first she despises Elizabeth for taking her away from Lori, refusing to acknowledge her as her 'mother'. She pulls stunts and different schemes to purposely annoy Elizabeth. However, after realizing the truth of all matters, Carter comes to accept Elizabeth as her mother and learns to deal with her family's chaotic ways. * Cynthia Watros as Elizabeth Wilson, Carter, Taylor, and Grant's mother and a detective with the Fairfax, VA police department. Elizabeth is very dedicated to finding common ground with Carter, sacrificing much time and resources (often at her family's expense). She was on the brink of divorce before reuniting with Carter, but ultimately decided she wanted her family together for once. She had slept with Kyle extensively before her family found out and forced her to come clean to David. * Alexis Denisof as David Wilson, Carter, Taylor, and Grant's father and a writer. He is pressured by his agent to write the book 'Finding Carter'. He lies about the book at first, reassuring Carter he would not publish anything or begin writing without her permission. However, he had already completed the memoir before even telling her the truth. He had an affair with Lori Stevens prior to Carter's abduction, revealing to Elizabeth that it was mostly his fault. David later takes a job as a professor at an academy. * Anna Jacoby-Heron as Taylor Wilson, Carter's fraternal twin sister, and Max's off and on girlfriend. Taylor is extremely intelligent, thoughtful and caring. She often gives Carter advice, eventually resulting in the two becoming very close. She later becomes romantically involved with Max, Carter's ex. They break up when she cannot accept how Max can forgive his former attacker. * Zac Pullam as Grant Wilson, Carter and Taylor's younger brother. Grant sees himself as the \\"replacement child\\", describing this in a way that everyone simply looks over him. He rarely receives attention, making him very impressionable and skeptical. He has an online relationship with a girl he Skypes with regularly. * Alex Saxon as Max Wagner (season 2; recurring, season 1), Taylor's boyfriend and Carter's best friend that she met while living with Lori. Max is compassionate and understanding, often the one his friends turn to for advice. He had a friends with benefits relationship with Carter before meeting Taylor, later becoming her boyfriend. He had a rather traumatic childhood, witnessing his mother being stabbed by his father when he was young. As a result of this, he does not let hatred build up inside of him; Max forgives Crash for almost taking his life because he wants to spare himself from any additional pain. ===Recurring=== * Milena Govich as Lori Stevens, who kidnapped Lyndon when she was three and raised her as Carter Stevens. It is revealed in the first episode of season 2 that she was an egg donor for Elizabeth and David, and is Carter and Taylor's biological mother. She is delusional and deeply convinced that she has all parental rights to Carter and Taylor. Lori is deemed insane and sent to a mental institution, later becoming suicidal. * Vanessa Morgan as Beatrix \\"Bird\\" Castro, Carter's best friend. In \\"Now You See Me\\" she reveals to Carter she was assaulted by a guy in a mask. Bird's parents are very well-off, and leave her for the most part to raise herself. After her parents skip town, their home is foreclosed on and she is forced to deal with the repercussions. She has a brief relationship with Madison before dating a guy named Seth. After he overdoses and dies, Bird finds out she is pregnant and ends up aborting the baby. * Jesse Henderson as Gabe Medeiros, Carter's friend and Taylor's best friend/former crush. He is the son of Elizabeth's partner, Kyle. Gabe has a one-sided interest in Carter, which she refuses because she thinks Taylor likes him. He lost his mother to brain cancer at a young age; Gabe firmly believes his father loved Elizabeth. * Jesse Carere as Ofe, Carter's friend and Taylor's former love interest. He was known for selling drugs that Crash supplies. He is crafty and quick- witted, considering himself a ladies' man by his own standards. He was Taylor's love interest, but decides to break up with Taylor in fear that she will break his heart. He leaves for a rehab program soon after. * Caleb Ruminer as Cameron \\"Crash\\" Mason, an ex-juvenile delinquent who was a drug dealer. He is Carter's boyfriend. He was hated by Carter's family initially, giving the wrong impressions when he shot Max in season 1 and eventually ruining his relationship with her. When the two make up later on, and after becoming friends with Max, proving he is reformed, he gets into trouble with his Uncle Shay, causing him out of fear to leave town and enlist in the army. * Eddie Matos as Kyle Medeiros, Gabe's father and Elizabeth's partner with whom she had an affair before and briefly after Carter was found. Kyle secretly hopes that Elizabeth will choose him over David and holds out hope almost relentlessly. In season 2, episode 11, he is shot by Crash's uncle, and dies from his injuries. * Meredith Baxter as Grandma Joan, Elizabeth's mother and the kids' grandmother. She is a wealthy, respected woman around town. Joan disapproves of her daughter's decision to marry David for his uncertain career and financial instability. * Robert Pine as Grandpa Buddy, Elizabeth's father, Joan's husband and the kids' grandfather. He is supportive of his daughter and caring when it comes to his grandchildren. * Stephen Guarino as Toby, literary agent of the father. * Molly Kunz as Madison, one of Carter's old \\"friends\\" from when she lived with Lori. She visited Carter after getting kicked out by her parents, who despise her for being a lesbian. Madison later tells Bird that she came because Lori sent her, feeling as if she was used to lure Carter away from the Wilsons'. She and Bird briefly date. * Erin Chambers as Hillary, David's assistant and love interest. She is upset when she finds out David goes back to Elizabeth. * Mason Dye as Damon * Elizabeth Hunter as Reagan, Grant's internet friend and love interest. * Ben Winchell as Benjamin Wallace, Lori and David's biological son. He is introduced in the midseason finale of Season 2. * Madison McLaughlin as Olivia, Ben's foster sister who Carter initially thinks is his girlfriend. Lori helps her get into rehab. * Jackson Rathbone as Jared, bartender and owner of bar who hired Carter as a waitress. He is introduced as of October 6, 2015. ==Production and development== Finding Carter was written as a writing sample by Emily Silver, who then shopped it around to networks such as ABC Family and MTV.

Sutton Salt Lake is also unique in that it lies in a region of windy cool-temperate maritime climate. This makes it different from most of the world's saline lakes, which usually form in arid continental landscapes. The total area of the lake, when the shallow depression is filled with rainwater, is nearly two hectares. The nearest coast is 50 kilometers from the lake. The area around Sutton Lake gets 500 mm of rainfall annually. Coastal hills create a minor barrier to the rain, halving the amount of rainfall that the lake receives.

He spent his youth in the rice fields of Cerano, in the Province of Novara in the Piedmont region. A self-taught artist, Bugo did not attend art or music school. In 2000 he moved to Milan, where he started his musical career. According to AllMusic, Bugo was one of the most interesting and controversial artists to emerge from the Italian independent scene of the 1990s. Although he is beloved by fans and critics, others consider him a comedy act. Blending international sound and Italian lyrics, Bugo became a cantautore (singer- songwriter) of the 2000s who moved the political songs of the 1970s into the disillusioned songwriting of the 2000s. He is considered a pioneer of the Italian singer-songwriter scene, and the neologism fantautore has been coined to describe him. ==Musical career== In 1992, Bugo left Cerano to serve in the Italian military. During his service, he learned to play the guitar and began writing songs. Bugo's first two albums, La Prima Gratta (2000) and Sentimento Westernato (2001) were released on independent labels. In 2002 he signed with Universal Music Group, and was chosen Artist of the Year. In October 2002 Bugo released his first album on Universal, Dal Lofai al Cisei. Its first single is \\"Casalingo\\" (\\"Household\\"), followed by \\"Io Mi Rompo I Coglioni\\" (\\"I Bust My Balls\\"), and they are among his most popular. In April 2004 Bugo released the double album, Golia & Melchiorre. It is divided in two parts: electric, experimental and intimate, acoustic music. The album cover shows Bugo holding his severed head by the hair like a modern Caravaggio. It was censored by the record company, which placed a picnic-basket sticker over Bugo's face. Its lead single, Carla √® Franca (\\"Carla Is Franca\\"), was also censored by the music television channels. Bugo's third album for Universal, Sguardo Contemporaneo, was released in April 2006; its single, Amore Mio Infinito (\\"My Infinite Love\\"), is a duet with actress Violante Placido. In 2008 Contatti was released on Universal, bringing Bugo into the mainstream. The album's first single, C'√® Crisi (\\"There's Crisis\\"), received airplay on national radio. In August 2008, producer-DJ Steve Aoki included \\"La Mano Mia\\" (The Bloody Beetroots remix) on a Radio-1 mix for BBC Radio. A video for Felicit√† (\\"Happiness\\") is directed by Federico Vitetta and Ty Evans and produced by Spike Jonze. Bugo performed on the main stage of the 2009 Italia Wave, celebrating the fortieth anniversary of Woodstock, re-interpreting Jimi Hendrix in Fire. In 2011 Bugo appeared in and wrote the soundtrack for the film Missione di pace (\\"Mission of Peace\\"), which premiered at the Venice Film Festival. That year he released another album on Universal, Nuovi rimedi per la miopia (\\"New Remedies For Myopia\\"). In July 2012 The Guardian published an article on current Italian music in Europe, citing Bugo, Jovanotti and Vasco Rossi. Bugo playing live in 2018 In 2013, before an Italian acoustic tour, Bugo played Comunque io voglio te (\\"However I Want You\\") for BalconyTV in New Delhi, an online music channel featuring acts on balconies around the world. In September 2013, director Andrea Caccia (who has filmed Bugo since 2001) announced that he is completing a film about Bugo's music entitled Ora Respiro (\\"Now I Breathe\\"). In February 2015 Bugo signed a contract with historic Italian label \\"Carosello Records\\" The announcement comes at the same time the inclusion of his face among the 100 of Italian music, the special celebratory by Rolling Stone Magazine, which defines Bugo \\"the irrepressible revolutionary of the Italian song\\". In April 2016 Nessuna scala da salire (\\"No ladder to climb\\") was released on Carosello, reaching Number 1 position of official vinyl chart. The promotional tour is very successful throughout Italy, with concerts in clubs and prestigious festivals like Primo Maggio in Rome and the Sziget Festival in Budapest. In 2018 \\"RockBugo\\" was released. The album is a collection of Bugo songs rearranged in rock style, following the steps of bands such as Oasis and Nirvana. He participated at the Sanremo Music Festival 2020 with the song \\"Sincero\\", performing with Morgan. On 7 February he released a new album entitled Cristian Bugatti. ==Visual arts== Between 2008 and 2014, Bugo has been working in the visual arts. In 2010 he held his first exhibition in Rome, displaying 67 people around the gallery's perimeter. Art International Radio, an online radio station based in New York City, interviewed him. In 2012 Bugo participated in MiArt, an international art fair in Milan, exhibiting three photographs of children with beards. He held his second solo exhibition at the Room Gallery, a large photographic installation of the overturned interior of the exhibition space. As part of a 2013 art series on the streets of Ghaziabad, India, Bugo displayed a billboard with a surreal phrase created from newspaper clippings against a red background. More art from newspaper clippings were included in the fourth issue of Le Dictateur, a magazine with twenty series of commissioned works by international artists at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. That year Bugo held his third solo exhibition at Wilson Project Space in Sassari, featuring a large self-portrait. A second self-portrait was displayed at \\"Art4shop\\" in September, and a third on the streets of New Delhi during the India Art Fair. ==Discography== *2000 ‚Äì La prima gratta (Snowdonia/Bar La Muerte Records) *2001 ‚Äì Sentimento westernato (Wallace Records/ Bar La Muerte Records) *2002 ‚Äì Dal lofai al cisei (Universal Music) *2004 ‚Äì Golia & Melchiorre (Universal Music) *2006 ‚Äì Sguardo contemporaneo (Universal Music) *2008 ‚Äì Contatti (Universal Music) *2011 ‚Äì Nuovi rimedi per la miopia (Universal Music) *2016 ‚Äì \\"Nessuna scala da salire\\" (Carosello Records) *2018 ‚Äì \\"RockBugo\\" (1day) *2020 ‚Äì \\"Cristian Bugatti\\" (Mescal) ==Exhibitions== *2009 ‚Äì Gemine Muse, Faraggiana Ferrandi Museum, Novara, Italy *2010 ‚Äì V.M.21 Gallery, solo exhibition, Rome, Italy *2012 ‚Äì Room Gallery, solo exhibition, Milan, Italy *2013 ‚Äì French fries killing lovers, billboard, Ghaziabad, India *2013 ‚Äì Solo exhibition at Wilson Project Space, Sassari, Italy *2013 ‚Äì Art4shop, public art project, Milan, Italy *2014 ‚Äì Untitled, billboard, New Delhi, India ==References *Official Website *Bugo at Carosello Records *Bugo Discography at Discogs *Bugo Biography at AllMusic.com *Bugo at Universal Music *Bugo at Room Gallery Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Italian contemporary artists Category:Italian male singer-songwriters Category:Italian singer-songwriters Category:21st-century artists Category:21st-century Italian singers Category:21st-century male singers ","title":"Bugo"},{"id":"41966816","text":"upright Adult Swim in a Box is a seven-disc DVD box set produced by Williams Street and released by Warner Home Video on October 27, 2009.

According to the network's now-defunct online shopping site, the set was chosen to harken to the experience of purchasing an entire album \\"because you knew you liked at least one song.\\" ==ContentsSeries=== * The second season volume release of Aqua Teen Hunger Force * The third season volume release of Space Ghost Coast to Coast * The first season volume release of Moral Orel * The second season volume release of Robot Chicken * The first season volume release of Metalocalypse * The second season volume release of Sealab 2021 ===Pilots=== The following pilots are contained on one disc: * Totally for Teens * Cheyenne Cinnamon and the Fantabulous Unicorn of Sugar Town Candy Fudge * Korgoth of Barbaria * Welcome to Eltingville * The pilot episode of Perfect Hair Forever ==Australian equivalent== A similar box set was released for Region 4 markets in Australia. Entitled the Adult Swim Meat Tray Collection, it consists of six discs containing the first and only season of Lucy, the Daughter of the Devil and the entirety of 12 oz. Mouse and Tom Goes to the Mayor. The set was released on November 28, 2012. A Region 2 version of Adult Swim in a Box had been released a year earlier on October 19. While still having the pilots DVD and Moral Orel. The first volume releases of SGC2C, ATHF, and Sealab are used instead, and Robot Chicken and Metalocalypse are not included. But Season One of Frisky Dingo, and the first volumes of Squidbillies and The Brak Show are now included. ==Critical reception== The box set received mixed critical reception; R.L. Shaffer of IGN was critical in his review of it, calling the release was \\"a complete waste\\" and the bonus disc \\"roughly 80 minutes of mediocre entertainment\\". He recommended fans purchase \\"the shows you like instead, and start in the proper place, with the first season.\\" He ultimately gave the release an eight out of ten, however, stating \\"while this set is certainly well rated\\" in its content, he could not \\"find a reason to recommend it\\". Noel Murray of The A.V. Club expressed confusion over the selection of material, suggesting to the network to release a \\"straight-up Adult Swim best-of set with rarities\\". DVD Verdict's Mac McEntire felt the set was not \\"good enough to warrant you re-buying them all\\", should buyers already own all six season volume releases. He gave the release an 85 out of 100, remarking the pilots as showing \\"just how tough it must be to create a pilot, one that not only introduces characters and settings, but also promises a potential for weeks and perhaps years of additional stories.\\" DVD Talk's Casey Burchby called the release \\"sloppy\\", stating that fans who already owned DVD releases from their favorite programming on the network \\"can safely skip the release\\", though the set \\"does fairly represent the insanely creative, off-the-wall nature of the network.\\" Jeff Niesel of the Cleveland Scene found the physical build of the set \\"a bit flimsy, but that's to be expected for such an affordably priced set.\\" The Austin Chronicle James Renovitch dubbed the release \\"the anti-box-set\\" that keeps \\"with the spirit of Adult Swim\\", while John Scott Lewinski of Wired called it \\"a sort of survival kit\\" for desperate fans of the network. Writing for Filter, Erik Nowlan rated it 90 percent, ensuring fans of Adult Swim will be \\"in pig heaven\\" upon its release. Nick Zaino of AOL TV praised the inclusion of Sealab 2021 and Metalocalypse, but called the pilots disc \\"a mixed bag, but mostly good.\\" PopMatters' W. Scott Poole felt that the selection of series was \\"odd\\", stating that while the series included \\"belong in any selection of Adult Swim bests\\", so did others, naming The Venture Bros. and Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law as deserving candidates that were not included. ==ReferencesWork cited=== * ==External links== * Box Category:Television videos and DVDs ","title":"Adult Swim in a Box"},{"id":"41966825","text":"Cho Jung-myung (born 24 December 1993) is a South Korean luger.

The role of TTPs in terrorism analysis is to identify individual patterns of behavior of a particular terrorist activity, or a particular terrorist organisation, and to examine and categorize more general tactics and weapons used by a particular terrorist activity, or a particular terrorist organisation. == Requirement to identify individual terrorism TTPs == The current approach to terrorism analysis involves an examination of individual terrorist, or terrorist organisations use of particular weapons, used in specific ways, and different tactics and strategies being exhibited. Broadly, a wide range of TTPs have been exhibited historically by individual terrorist, or terrorist organisations worldwide.Flaherty, C. (2012) Dangerous Minds: Attps://eccp.poste.dŸÉŸÉŸÉ Monograph on the Relationship Between Beliefs ‚ÄìBehaviours ‚Äì Tactics. Published by OODA LOOP (7 September 2012).URL: http://www.oodaloop.com/security/2012/09/07/dangerous-minds-the-relationship- between-beliefs-behaviors-and-tactics/ == Key concepts  Evolution of TTPs === All terrorists, or terrorist organisations, worldwide historically have exhibited an evolution in TTPs. This can be as a result of: * changing circumstances; * resource availability; or, * changing ideologies, or 'war- focus'. In the case of the Taliban, their tactics have consisted primarily of guerrilla-style improvised explosive device (IED) attacks and small-arms ambushes against international and state-level security forces and interests, such as police checkpoints and military supply convoys. However, more recently Taliban TTPs have expanded to include mass casualty attacks by suicide bombers and other suicide attacks in order to undermine the current government. === Kill-chain model === The kill-chain model, and kill-chain model variations The kill-chain model (KCM) is a conceptual tool used in terrorism analysis and studies. Sullivan, J.P., Bauer, A. eds (2008). Terrorism Early Warning: 10 Years of Achievement in Fighting Terrorism and Crime. Los Angeles, CA: Los Angeles Sheriff‚Äôs Department. All terrorists' or terrorist organisations' TTPs form part of understanding the terrorist kill chain, which is the pattern of transactional activities, link together in order for a terrorist act to take place. Broadly, this involves describing the 'hierarchy of tasks and sub-tasks that may be involved in the execution', or in making a terrorist act happen. These can include the arrangement and sequence of activities a terrorist or terrorist organisation uses in planning, organizing, mobilizing, training, equipping and staging resources and operatives. These activities make up the terrorist or terrorist organisations' modus operandi or 'attack system'. Four sets of steps make-up the full KCM: * The first set of activities are the 'attack preparation steps'. In terms of terrorism analysis, individual transactions, such as acquiring finances, acquiring expertise, acquiring materiel, munitions or capability, recruiting members, conducting reconnaissance, mission rehearsal, conducting an attack, have signatures that identify them as terrorist or criminal acts or are consistent with the operations of a specific individual, cell or group. * The second set of activities are called the 'execution timeline'. This identifies the timeline, along which the terrorist, or terrorist organisations various activities, leading up to an attack process flows time-wise. * The third set of activities is identified as 'targeting'. An individual or group would carry out some form of dedicated reconnaissance with the aim of identifying weaknesses in the site or operation; and with that information determine the best method of attack. * The fourth set of activities is identified as the 'planning stages'. These involve some type of planning activity embedded into the ‚Äòkill chain‚Äô, and is part of the process of organizing, mobilizing, training, equipping, staging, collecting resources and operatives. These make up the terrorist or terrorist organisations‚Äô modus operandi, or its system of attack. The KCM ‚Äúsequence of activities‚Äù is not linear, but discontinuous. Three additional KCM scenarios can be identified:Flaherty, C. (2012) Dangerous Minds: A Monograph on the Relationship Between Beliefs ‚ÄìBehaviours ‚Äì Tactics. Published by OODA LOOP (7 September 2012).URL: http://www.oodaloop.com/security/2012/09/07/dangerous- minds-the-relationship-between-beliefs-behaviors-and-tactics/ * An individual or group actively promote a terrorist/extremist ideology on the internet, in books, pamphlets, etc. This is then picked up by another terrorist, or terrorist organisations, who then act on this. * Two or more parallel kill chain sequence of activities (by various individuals/groups) which are only indirectly connected by intermediary individuals/groups. Sharing similar beliefs, but as well cross over into complementary beliefs/ideologies. Many such intermediaries can operate in this space, passing ideas and resources, even recruits between the various terrorist, or terrorist organisations, groups and cells. * A terrorist or terrorist organisations picks up ideas, knowledge, etc., and jump-start into various places along the ‚Äòstandard‚Äô concept of the KCM. == Transfer of Terrorist Tactics, Techniques and Procedures == Terrorist TTPs are often transferred between various terrorists, or terrorist organisations, and they often learn from each other.Hedges, M. Karasik, T. Evolving Terrorist Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) Migration Across South Asia, Caucasus, and the Middle East. INEGMA Special Report No. 7. URL: The degree to which the transfer of TTPs occurs depends on their relative success when transferred to a different conflict, and a different environment. The similarities in TTPs between various terrorists, or terrorist organisations, across conflicts and periods suggest a transfer of information. * Explicit Knowledge: This is the theoretical information which is often stored in hard copies, such as textbooks, manuals and on computers through PDF and video files. These are extremely easy to get hold of, but without the appropriate teaching or experience, this easy access information is commonly not effectively used. * Tactical Knowledge: Most commonly taught or learnt through experience and hands on teaching. This requires training establishments to be organised. For terrorists, or terrorist organisations, acquiring this information is harder, and more difficult; however, it is seen as a more effective transfer of knowledge. == Key tactical concepts related to TTPs == Several key tactical concepts can be related to TTPs, which are typically used in terrorism or insurgency operations. * Interposing tacticsFlaherty, C.

It is the second most prevalent type of lung cancer after lung adenocarcinoma and it originates in the bronchi. Its tumor cells are characterized by a squamous appearance, similar to the one observed in epidermal cells. Squamous-cell carcinoma of the lung is strongly associated with tobacco smoking, more than any other forms of NSCLC. == Signs and symptoms == Squamous-cell lung carcinoma share most of the signs and symptoms with other forms of lung cancer. These include worsening cough, including hemoptysis, chest pain, shortness of breath and weight loss. Symptoms may result from local invasion or compression of adjacent thoracic structures such as compression involving the esophagus causing dysphagia, compression involving the laryngeal nerves causing change in voice, or compression involving the superior vena cava causing facial edema. Distant metastases may also cause pain and show symptoms related to other organs. == Causes  Risk factors === Squamous-cell carcinoma of the lung is closely correlated with a history of tobacco smoking, more so than most other types of lung cancer. According to the Nurses' Health Study, the relative risk of SCC is approximately 5.5, both among those with a previous duration of smoking of 1 to 20 years, and those with 20 to 30 years, compared to never-smokers. The relative risk increases to approximately 16 with a previous smoking duration of 30 to 40 years, and approximately 22 with more than 40 years. == Mechanism  Pathogenesis === It most often arises centrally in larger bronchi, and while it often metastasizes to locoregional lymph nodes (particularly the hilar nodes) early in its course, it generally disseminates outside the thorax somewhat later than other major types of lung cancer. Large tumors may undergo central necrosis, resulting in cavitation. A squamous-cell carcinoma is often preceded for years by squamous-cell metaplasia or dysplasia in the respiratory epithelium of the bronchi, which later transforms to carcinoma in situ. Large scale studies such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have systematically characterized recurrent somatic alterations likely driving lung squamous-cell carcinoma initiation and development.  Gene mutations and copy number alterations  Squamous-cell lung carcinoma is one of the tumor types with the highest number of mutations since smoking, the main driver of the disease, is a strong mutagenic factor. Inactivating mutations in lung SCC affect many tumor suppressor genes such as TP53 (mutated in 81% of cases), MLL2 (20%), CDKN2A (15%), KEAP1 (12%) and PTEN (8%). Recurrent loss-of-function mutations have been observed also in NOTCH1 (8%), suggesting a tumor suppressive role in lung SCC for this gene, that has also been implicated as an oncogene in haematological cancers. On the other hand, recurrent gain-of-function mutations have been found in oncogenes such as PIK3CA (16%) and NFE2L2 (15%). Common oncogene copy number amplifications have been found in SOX2, PDGFRA, EGFR, FGFR1 and CCND1. Deletions were observed in tumor suppressors such as CDKN2A, PTEN and NF1. Some alterations such as the ones affecting TP53 and CDKN2A are shared by lung SCC and the other most common type of NSCLC, lung adenocarcinoma. Conversely, the two main driver oncogenes of the latter, EGFR and KRAS, are rarely mutated in lung SCC.  Somatically altered pathways  Many of the gene mutations and copy number alterations occur in pathways whose deregulation seems to be important for the initiation and progression of the tumor. Specifically, KEAP1 and NFE2L2 belong to the oxidative stress response pathways; alterations in these genes tend to occur in a mutually exclusive fashion, and therefore this pathway is overall altered in more than 30% of the cases. Similarly, the squamous cell differentiation pathway, whose components include SOX2, TP63 and NOTCH1, is altered in 44% of the tumors. Alterations in the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway are also common but not as widespread as for the adenocarcinoma type.  RNA expression profiles  Recently, four mRNA expression subtypes (primitive, basal, secretory, and classical) were identified and validated within squamous-cell carcinoma. The primitive subtype correlates with worse patient survival. These subtypes, defined by intrinsic expression differences, provide a possible foundation for improved patient prognosis and research into individualized therapies. == Diagnosis == Early squamous-cell carcinoma of the lung (generally as squamous- cell carcinoma in situ) is asymptomatic and may only appear as an incidental imaging finding on CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging as a lung nodule. Eventually, it becomes symptomatic, usually when the tumor mass begins to obstruct the lumen of a major bronchus, often producing distal atelectasis and infection. Cytopathology may detect atypical cells from cytologic smear test of sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, or samples from endobronchial brushings. Histopathology requires at least a lung biopsy. On such exams, these tumors range from well differentiated, showing keratin pearls and cell junctions, to anaplastic, with only minimal residual squamous-cell features.Entire section, if not else specified, is taken from === Classification === The 2015 WHO classification of lung tumors divided squamous cell lung carcinomas into 3 categories: keratinizing, non-keratinizing and basaloid. Keratinizing SCC harbor features of keratinization; non-keratinizing SCC lack such features but show other squamous markers, such as p40 and p63; finally, basaloid SCC is a rare subset of poorly differentiated squamous cell lung carcinoma. Previous variants such as papillary, small-cell and clear-cell SCC were discarded from the current classification as these subtypes are very uncommon. There is no clear evidence of prognostic significance to the subtyping of lung squamous cell carcinoma. == Treatment == Treatment of lung squamous-cell carcinoma depends on many factors including stage, resectability, performance status and genomic alterations acquired by the individual tumor. Therapy of early-stage SCC mimics that of other histologic types of NSCLC. Early stage (I, II and IIIA) lung SCC are typically resected surgically, and cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation may be used as an adjuvant therapy following surgery. On the other hand, advanced, metastatic or recurrent lung SCC are given first-line systemic therapy with a palliative (i.e., noncurative) intent consisting of cytotoxic chemotherapy, most commonly a platinum-based doublet. Either cisplatin or carboplatin is used as the platinum backbone. Development of targeted therapies has been less rapid for lung SCC with respect to adenocarcinoma, as ALK rearrangements and EGFR mutations targetable with receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors are much less frequent in the former compared to the latter. Immunotherapy is showing promising results for NSCLC, and anti-PD-1 agent nivolumab has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for lung SCC. == Epidemiology == Lung squamous-cell carcinoma is the second most common histologic type of lung cancer after adenocarcinoma, reaching 22.6% of all lung cancer cases as of 2012. The relative incidence of the former has been steadily decreasing in favor of the latter due to the decreasing smoking rates in the last few years. As much as 91% of lung SCC has been found to be attributable to cigarette smoking. Incidence is greater in men than in women. == References == Category:Lung cancer ","title":"Squamous-cell carcinoma of the lung"},{"id":"41966919","text":"The Green Room Award for Female Actor in a Leading Role (Music Theatre) is an annual award recognising excellence in the performing arts in Melbourne, Australia.

The house, built circa 1790, is owned by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. and located at the intersection of First Street and Old Route 3 in North Dupo. ==Description== The Martin‚ÄìBoismenue House, built about 1790 by North American frontiersman Pierre Martin in what was at the time the French village of Pierre du Pont, is one of the oldest surviving structures in Illinois. Although the house was built after the American Bottom had been ceded to the young United States of America, the house reflects the French Colonial architectural traditions of the Mississippi River valley. The region immediately around Cahokia, Illinois continued to speak French for several decades after the cession. It is one of six surviving poteaux-sur-sol ('post- on-sill') structures, and the only one owned by an upper-middle-class individual. The poteaux-sur-sol style used vertical logs to construct houses; the style, originally developed in Europe, had faded in popularity before French colonists revived it. Only 33 vertical log buildings remain in the United States; of these, the Pierre Martin House is one of only two with a dressed stone basement. The traditional French building scheme shares many elements with traditional European half timbering. Squared-log outer walls support the roof; the logs, squared off by hand-hewing or with a pit saw, rest on a log sill mounted on a stone foundation. 'Galleries,' wide porches, enclose the house's north and south facades. The house consists of a two-room first floor, a large attic, a half basement, and the two galleries. There was no shortage of firewood in the Illinois Territory during the house's early history, and the three separate fireplaces were used to heat the home and acted as places for cooking. The Martin‚ÄìBoismenue House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 9, 1990 as NRHP site #89002350.

But the justification given for this and also for a couple of other reactions, are not acceptable\\". Balaji B wrote \\"While the topic of the wayward husband lends itself to comedy, the plight of the women is not be taken lightly. Directors who stick to one tone throughout seem to be more successful while those who try to offer up a mixture of the two end up delivering neither satisfactorily. S.P.Rajakumar chooses to take the latter path and the final verdict is the same - the movie struggles between being a light comedy and a serious tearjerker\\". Chennai Online wrote \\"The plot did have the potential to make it an engaging entertainer. But the problem is that the director couldn't really decide as to what type of treatment he should give his plot. Whether it should be in the genre of a comedy or a melodrama, of a family sentiment or of a saga of a family feud. So he makes a hotchpotch of the whole thing, and it does not help matters\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20010405150614/http://www.chennaionline.com/Moviereviews/tammov108.asp ==References Category:Indian films Category:Tamil films remade in other languages Category:2001 films Category:2000s Tamil-language films Category:Indian comedy-drama films Category:Films scored by Deva (composer) Category:Films directed by S.

Following a general overhaul of Comuni√≥n command layer in 1934 the former Integrists gained a strong position and their man Manuel Fal Conde rose to J√©fe Delegado.

Major shakeup of requet√© organisation was co- ordinated by the military and Zamanillo is not credited for it, see Gonz√°lez Calleja 2011, p. 371 His key objective was to re-formatJulio Ar√≥stegui, Combatientes Requet√©s en la Guerra Civil espa√±ola, 1936-1939, Madrid 2013, , pp. 81-82 requet√© into a nationwide Frente Nacional de Boinas Rojas,technical objective of reorganisation to Frente Nacional was to detach Requet√© cells from local Carlist circulos and create a separate nationwide structure. The military aim was to inject more homogeneity, gain critical mass, enable planning above the tactical level and reinforce steerability. The political aim was to lessen the Carlist dependence on Navarre and enhance the position of national leadership the task successfully carried out in course of 1935.Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 220-221 Himself involved in logistics,on one occasion he crossed the French-Spanish frontier with a load of 400 pistols, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 223 he was however focused on recruitment,none of the sources mentions Zamanillo against the background of sending some Carlist paramilitary to Italy for training in the summer of 1934, see e.g. Robert Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠, El Carlisme Catal√† Durant La Segona Rep√∫blica Espanyola 1931-1936, Barcelona 2008, , p. 198, Gonz√°lez Calleja 2011, p. 198 with the overall Requet√© strength growing from 4,000 in late 1934Gonz√°lez Calleja 2011, p. 193 to 25,000 in mid-1936.Gonz√°lez Calleja 2011, p. 373. Geographical distribution of the requet√© was very uneven.

There is also a theory which charges Blinkhorn, Gonzalez Calleja and Ar√≥stegui with accepting Carlist post-war myths as to numerosity and strength of these units and claims that the Carlist paramilitary was of marginal importance, see Roberto Mu√±oz Bolanos, El primer intento de \\"gran coalici√≥n\\": el proyecto de sublevaci√≥n carlista (marzo/mayo de 1936), [in:] Dami√°n A, Gonz√°lez, Manuel Ortiz Heras, Juan Sisinio P√©rez Garz√≥n (eds.), La Historia, lost in translation?, Albacete 2016, , p. 1650 Carlist meeting, 1930s Politically Zamanillo remained among the Carlist hawks; though he signed the Bloque Nacional funding act,Maximiliano Garcia Venero, Historia de la Unificacion, Madrid 1970, p. 72 in 1935 he developed enmity towards the monarchist alliance advanced by the likes of Rodezno and Pradera.Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2008, p. 281 On the other hand, he remained on excellent terms with the Cantabrian Falange and its leader Manuel Hedilla.Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 181-182, 235 The policy backfired when in 1936 the Carlists were left out of the local Cantabrian Candidatura Contrarrevolucionaria;Sanz Hoya 2009, p. 68 standing on their ownSanz Hoya 2009, p. 98 they fared badly and Zamanillo lost his Cortes ticket with just 12,000 votes gathered.according to his later account, Zamanillo and his supporters \\"sab√≠amos que no hab√≠a ninguna posibilidad de obtener actas\\", Garcia Venero 1970, p. 32.

He might have enlisted to Tercio de NavarraNicolas served first in Tercio del Rey commanding 3. company (Sicilia), later led Santanderinos during formation of formed Tercio del Camino, and in 1937 later incorporated into Tercio de Navarra, commanding 1. company as teniente, Ar√≥stegui 2013, pp. 181-182, 360 or Tercio de Palencia,Gregorio was a medic in Tercio Castellano de Mola and Tercio de Palencia, Ar√≥stegui 2013, p. 636 where his brothers served, though scarce information does not allow to tell which Zamanillo was meant in the reports.Lizarza 2006, pp. 159-160 In May 1937 he was still noted in Pamplona, when dodging unification process he was issuing antedated requet√© promotions.e.g. in May 1937 he signed nominations antedating them to January 1, 37; the purpose was to ensure better standing of the requet√©s in unified structures, Ar√≥stegui 2013, p. 496 Also later Zamanillo kept sabotaging unification; in November 1937 and still in Pamplona he assisted Carlist volunteers who deserted from Falange-dominated units and re-directed them to newly formed Navarrese tercios.Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 67 Civil War Once Cantabria had been taken over by the Nationalists some young local Carlists started to form anti-unification resistance groups. The dissenters, dubbed \\"Tercio Jos√© Luis Zamanillo\\", were eventually prosecuted; it is not clear to what extent Zamanillo was involvedSanz Hoya 2009, p. 219 and whether he held any posts in the new Nationalist administration of Santander.a November 1937 press mentiond a \\"Jos√© Zamanillo\\" as alcalde of Santander, Bolet√≠n Oficial de la Provincia de Santander 08.11.37, available here. None of the sources consulted mentions Zamanillo as holding posts in the local Cantabrian administration of the time There is almost no information on Zamanillo's whereabouts during 1938, except minor pieces related to occasional Carlist feasts.e.g. in March 1938, Noticiero de Sor√≠a 10.03.38, available here In early 1939, shortly before the end of the war, he co-signed a document named Manifestacion de los Ideales Tradicionalistas, a memorandum of key Carlist politicians; delivered to Franco, it contained a lengthy discourse arguing that once the war was about to end, it was time to introduce the Traditionalist monarchy.Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Rod√≥n Guinjoan, Invierno, primavera y oto√±o del carlismo (1939-1976) [PhD thesis Universitat Abat Oliba CEU], Barcelona 2015 , p. 61 The document was left with no response. ==Carlist against Francoism (1940-1954)== Albacete In the early 1940s, Zamanillo formed the core of Falcondistas, acting as watchdogs of the Carlist orthodoxy. Fal, partially incommunicado,exiled or at home arrest considered him, Senante and Lamami√© \\"el triunvirato de los feroces integristas tachados de intemprantes\\"Mart√≠nez S√°nchez 2002, p. 422 and indeed as Fal's trustee he carried out appointments in Navarre, always keen to pursue their own policy.the mission triggered conflict with the Navarros, represented by Joaqu√≠n Baleztena. He complained that nominations should be carried out not by means of top-down appointments but rather by means of bottom-up elections, Aurora Villanueva Mart√≠nez, Organizacion, actividad y bases del carlismo navarro durante el primer franquismo [in:] Geronimo de Uztariz 19 (2003), pp. 103-104 He made sure that Comuni√≥n remained neutral towards the European war,Manuel Santa Cruz [Alberto Ruiz de Galarreta], Apuntes y documentos para la Historia del Tradicionalismo Espa√±ol, vol. 2, Madrid 1979, p. 26 that claims of the new Alfonsist claimant Don Juan were rejectedin 1940 he co- edited response to Don Juan, Santa Cruz 1979, p. 26 with pro-Juanista sympathies eradicatedMart√≠nez S√°nchez 2002, p. 422 and that there was no political collaboration with the regime. In a 1941 document he castigated Francoism as totalitarian system rejected by the society.\\"el r√©gimen totalitario, asentado en un partido √∫nico, ha de producir frutos nefastos, en la pr√°ctica, el instaurado en Espa√±a ha superado en sus desastrosos efectos a todas las previsiones\\", which \\"la sociedad entera con asombrosa unanimidad repudia y condena un sistema, que ha malogrado totalmente el fruto de la victoria sobre los rojos\\". In terms of proposals, Zamanillo and the group recommended the following: 1) stay firmly by ideals and stick to loyalty; 2) study traditionalist ideario and develop the doctrine; 3) prepare solutions at opportune time to be presented to the government, Santa Cruz 1979, p. 76 Touring the country from Sevillein 1940 he spoke in Sevilla at an Acci√≥n Cat√≥lica meetings, Mart√≠nez S√°nchez 2002, p. 371. At this opporunity he was also introduced by Fal to cardenal Segura, Mart√≠nez S√°nchez 2002, p. 412 to Barcelonain 1942 he spoke at the Montserrat rally, Alcal√° 2001, p. 52 Zamanillo delivered addresses at meetings styled as Christian or ex-combatant feasts. In 1943 he co-signed Reclamacion del poder, Carlist memorandum demanding introduction of Traditionalist monarchy;Ballestero 2014, p. 80, Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2014, p. 96, Alcal√° 2001, p. 52, full text Santa Cruz 1979, pp. 173-219 in May he was detained,Sanrta Cruz 1979, p. 227 spent a week in police dungeonsMartorell P√©rez 2009, p. 243 and was ordered exile in Albacete,Jordi Canal, El carlismo, Madrid 2000, , p. 344, Alcal√° 2001, p. 57 terminated in April 1944.having to report to a police station every 15 days, Santa Cruz 1979, p. 228 Still head of Requet√© structures he tried to prevent their disintegration.1944 regional requete jefes still reported straight to Zamanillo, Villanueva Mart√≠nez 2003, p. 108 In 1945 he was among those behind Pamplona riots; detained and trialed in early 1946,Martorell P√©rez 2009, pp. 310-312, Aurora Villanueva Mart√≠nez, Los incidentes del 3 de diciembre de 1945 en la Plaza del Castillo, [in:] Principe de Viana 58 (1997), pp. 630, 637, 640 Zamanillo was the only member of Carlist executive sentenced to unconditional incarceration.it is not clear what was the incarceration time, Villanueva Mart√≠nez 1997, p. 644. It must have not lasted longer than 4 months, as in May Zamanillo was recorded as attending another Carlist gathering By May 1946 Zamanillo was free again, speaking at the predominantly Carlist Montserrat feast.Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2014, p. 104 He used to attend the gathering systematically, present also in 1947,Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 323 though in the late 1940s his relations with Sivatte, chief personality of Catalan Carlism, deteriorated; Zamanillo's calls for discipline were largely aimed against the Sivattistas.in 1948, Alcal√° 2001, p. 88 Confirmed as member of Consejo Nacionalin 1947 and with Fal, Valiente, Saenz-Siez and Lamamie, Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2014, p. 106, Canal 2000, pp. 350-351 and attending the first gathering or regional leaders since Insua he was bent on preserving Traditionalist identity against Francoist distortions and called for setting up Centro de Estudios Doctrinales.Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 321 An awkward sign of recognition came in wake of his 1948 trip to Rome,he visited Rome with Fal and Lamamie during Easter of 1948 and was received by Pius XII, Mart√≠nez S√°nchez 2002, p. 480 when the √©migr√© PSUC periodical noted him among \\"dirigents del [Carlist] movimient\\" whose dissidence demonstrated ongoing decomposition of Francoism.Lluita 26.05.48, available here Carlists on Francoist parade, 1940s It is neither clear where Zamanillo lived in the late 1940s and early 1950s nor how he made a living; sporadically he was mentioned as related either to SantanderIn 1952 he was still noted in the press as related to Santander, Bolet√≠n oficial de la provincia de Santander 17.09.52, available here or to Madrid,in 1945 police detained him \\"in his Madrid home\\" in both cases connected to the education system.for 1952 see Bolet√≠n oficial de la provincia de Santander 17.09.52, available here, for 1957 see Hoja Oficial de Lunes 16.12.57, available here Most likely he kept practicing as a lawyer, as demonstrated by proceedings related both to minors and to politics: in 1953 he was involved in machinations to ensure that former wife of another Carlist claimant, the late Carlos VIII, would not get legal custody of their juvenile daughters. As the action was allegedly triggered by Franco himself,Francisco de las Heras y Borrero, Un pretendiente desconocido. Carlos de Habsburgo. El otro candidato de Franco, Madrid 2004, , p. 132 the episode might be indicative of Zamanillo's improving relations with the regime. On the Carlist front he remained loyal to Fal and kept fighting the increasingly vocal Sivattistas;in the early 1905s he was sent on a mission to calm Catalonia to impose measures against Catalan separatism and against the Sivattistas, Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2014, p. 127 none of the sources consulted clarifies whether he joined those pressing Don Javier to terminate the regency and to claim monarchic rights himself, what sort of happened in Barcelona in 1952;Alcal√° 2001, p. 99 it was only much later that he declared it a grave error.ABC 27.09.75, available here In 1954 he was confirmed as a member of largely inactive Junta Nacional and its day-to-day executive, a Permanent Commission.with Valiente, Saenz-Diez and Fagoaga, Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2014, p. 138, Mercedes V√°zquez de Prada, El nuevo rumbo pol√≠tico del carlismo hacia la colaboraci√≥n con el r√©gimen (1955-56), [in:] Hispania 69 (2009), p. 184 ==Carlist in collaboration (1955-1962)== Valiente (earlier pic) When Fal Conde resigned in August 1955 Zamanillo was still member of Junta Nacionalwith Valiente, Saenz-Diez and Jaime de Carlos, Mercedes V√°zquez de Prada, El final de una ilusi√≥n.

It is not clear where Zamanillo stood; for 20 years the right hand of adamant Fal,following Fal's deposition Zamanillo wrote him cordial and most likely sincere letters, Fidaldo, Burgue√±o 1980, p. 54 only some time later he emerged as supporter of the collaborative strategy, championed by Valiente. Within Carlism the anti-Francoist feelings were running high,most Carlists were firmly anti-collaborative at the time, Martorell P√©rez 2014, p. 114 with especially the Navarros and the Gipuzkoanos trying to sabotage his nomination;Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 353 during the 1956 Montejurra gathering they tried to block his access to the microphone, and when he finally succeeded, they cut the cables.Alcal√° 2001, p. 125 However, the collaborationists and Zamanillo consolidated their position; backed by the claimant,Zamanillo was at that time considered representative of Javierismo, Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2014, p. 152 who conferred Carlist honors upon him,in 1956 Zamanillo was made a Knight of the Orden de la Legitimidad Proscrita, Francisco Manuel Heras y Borrero, Carlos Hugo el Rey que no pudo ser: la lucha por el trono de Espa√±a de Carlos Hugo de Borb√≥n Parma, la √∫ltima esperanza del carlismo, Madrid 2010, , p. 77, Heras y Borrero 2004, p. 100 he was handling the link to Movimiento,Jeremy MacClancy, The Decline of Carlism, Reno 2000, , p. 92. Other authors claim rather that Zamanillo cultivated links with ministers and technocrats, V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 87 a tricky task as the Carlist rank and file booed and jeered whenever the name of the Francoist state party was mentioned.MacClancy 2000, pp. 92-93 Together with Valiente and Saenz-D√≠ez he soon emerged as member of a new triumvirate running the party.Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2014, p. 150, Javier Lavard√≠n, Historia del ultimo pretendiente a la corona de Espa√±a, Paris 1976, p. 46, Rod√≥n Guinjoan 2015, p. 144 Don Javier, 1960 The new strategy seemed to work and in 1957 Zamanillo was rumored to land a ministerial jobMacClancy 2000, p. 93 or a high position in Movimiento,allegedly in 1957 Valiente targeted a job in the government while Zamanillo had his eyes set on the Movimiento, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 20, Lavardin 1976, p. 67 the perspective which faded away once Arrese had been replaced with Solis.Rod√≥n Guinjoan 2015, p. 148 Undeterred, he kept advocating flexibility towards the regime as the best way to confront Juanistas, who should be beaten not \\"en los montes sino desde los cargos oficiales\\".V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 72 In 1958according to some sources in 1960; the position is also referred to as secretario nacional of Secretaria Nacional, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 80, Canal 2000, p. 356, V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 118 he was nominated secretario general, a new position reporting only to Valiente,Rod√≥n Guinjoan 2015, p. 203 and the same year got double-hatted as regional jefe of Castilla la Vieja.V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 79 He cautiously endorsed introduction of the Carlist prince Carlos HugoLavardin 1976, p. 43 and taking advantage of his links with the regime officials intervened to spare him trouble, be it after the 1958 Montejurra,when police intercepted Carlos Hugo on his way from Montejurra to the French frontier. An officer confiscated Carlos Hugo's French passport; it took Zamanillo, with his sense of authority and command, to arrive and corner the official, making him return the passport. The whole scene took place somewhere in the Navarrese countryside, Lavardin 1976, pp. 74-75 before the 1960 Montejurra,prior to the 1960 Montejurra Zamanillo talked with Solis to ensure Carlos Hugo's entry. When despite the agreement Carlos Hugo was stopped at the border crossing in Irun, the Carlists called Zamanillo, who unleashed his fury over the telephone and got Carlos Hugo allowed to pass, Lavardin 1976, pp. 90-91 securing his residence permit in Madrid in 1960V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 111 and 19611961 Carlos Hugo was permitted and settle in Madrid thanks to the talks that Zamanillo held with Solis, Lavardin 1976, p. 110 or launching the bid for Spanish citizenship for the Borbon-Parmas.V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 141 At the turn of the decades, Zamanillo's position in Carlism reached its climax. Though Valiente was officially nominated new Jefe Delegado, due to his requet√© past Zamanillo enjoyed more prestige;MacClancy 2000, p. 98, Lavardin 1976, p. 14 he handed over the post of requet√© leader as late as 1960.as requete jefe Zamanillo was replaced with Jos√© Arturo M√°rquez de Prado, V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 172, Lavardin 1976, p. 91 Within the party he was entrusted with disciplinary missions.in 1960 he formed part of a committee to re-organise Carlism in Valencia and Catalonia, V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 81 When addressing gatherings at Montserratin 1957 Zamanillo was present at two competitive Montserrat feasts, one organized by the Javieristas and one by the Sivattistas, Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2014, p. 155. For 1958 see Rod√≥n Guinjoan 2015, p. 201, Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2014, p. 2014 161 and MontejurraLavardin 1976, p. 74 he could have afforded to ignore suggestions of Movimientoprior to the 1958 Montejurra gathering Alonso Vega told Zamanillo he had better not attend; Zamanillo disregarded the advice, Lavardin 1976, pp. 71-72 and Carlistprior to the 1958 Montserrat Sivatte asked Zamanillo to avoid personal references; Zamanillo disregarded the request and mentioned Fal as example of loyalty. From this moment he was no longer invited to speak at the Sivattista Montserrat gatherings, Alcal√° 2001, pp. 111-112 leaders alike. During aplecs advocating \\"religious unity consubstantial with national unity\\",MacClancy 2000, p. 148 since 1959 he organized \\"marchas al Valle de los Ca√≠dos\\", an initiative providing opportunity to fraternize with the FalangistsMartorell P√©rez 2014, p. 149 and himself frequently wined and dined with the Movimiento officials,V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 107 even though he was suspicious about genuine intentions of the regime.e.g. in October 1960 Zamanillo wrote Solis a somewhat bitter letter; he claimed that while officially no claimant was preferred of privileged, in fact the regime promoted the Juanistas, Rod√≥n Guinjoan 2015, pp. 187-188 In 1961 Zamanillo was nominated to Consejo Nacional,V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 136 which guaranteed seat in the Cortes,see Zamanillo's 1961 ticket at the official Cortes service, available here and in 1962 he was admitted by Franco.Martorell P√©rez 2014, p. 150 ==Breakup (1962-1963)== Carlist standard Zamanillo's interventions facilitating Carlos Hugo's entry proved successfulin 1975 Zamanillo referred to Carlos Hugo as \\"muy simp√°tico, el cl√°sico franc√©s. El dec√≠a que era un Principe europeo, cosa que a nosotros no nos hac√≠a ninguna gracia\\", ABC 27.09.1975, available here and in January 1962 the young prince settled in Madrid. He turned a group of his young entourage into Secretar√≠a Privada,in late 1961, V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 147 which in turn embarked on a number of new initiatives. Zamanillo viewed them as part of the collaborationist strategy and supported; in 1960 Semana Nacional de Estudios of AET in Valle de los Caid√≥s he spoke about a possibilist evolution of the doctrinefull title Estudio razonado de la evoluci√≥n doctrinal del carlismo. Nuevos rumbos de la doctrina carlista: la pol√≠tica posibilista como resultado, Martorell P√©rez 2014, p. 102, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 465 and engaged in C√≠rculos V√°zquez de Mella.Circulos V√°zquez de Mella were increasingly controlled by AET and the Hugocarlistas; in 1960 Zamanillo delivered a lecture on La personalidad de Mella, Martorell P√©rez 2009, p. 464 The sympathy, however, was not reciprocal.

The other episodes of 1963 which contributed to the shift were especially departure of Traditionalist pundits Francisco El√≠as de Tejada and Rafael Gambra ==Francoist (1964-1974)== Cortes building In the early 1960s Zamanillo was already considered icon of collaborationism, as evidenced by his 1961 nomination to its Consejo Nacional.Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠ 2014, p. 255 In 1962 Franco thought him a candidate for vice-minister of justice, nomination thwarted by Carrero Blanco, who denounced him ‚Äì either erroneously or as part of own stratagem ‚Äì as supporter of Carlos Hugo.when in April 1962 the Franco entourage dwere discussing how to fill the vacancy for subsecretario de justicia, Carrero suggested Blas Pi√±ar. Franco dismissed the proposal (\\"es un exaltado\\") and went on to suggest Zamanillo. \\"Este es hugonote\\" said Carrero, and the post finally went to Antonio Maria Oriol. As at the time differences between Zamanillo and Carlos Hugo were already evident, it is not clear whether the opinion of Carrero resulted from poor intelligence or was rather a conscious attempt to against Zamanillo, perhaps related by Carrero (correctly) to the Falangist core. The account referred after Blas Pi√±ar, Escrito para la historia, Madrid 2000, , p. 167 Following expulsion from Carlism Zamanillo was welcome among the Movimiento hardliners.

In his books Bold Relief and When Movements Matter and in a string of articles, Amenta‚Äôs political mediation model proffers theory regarding interactions between the internal characteristics of movements and their external environments. Amenta argues that particular movement tactics work better in some contexts than in others, and his empirical work shows interactions between the assertiveness of movement tactics and short-term political contexts. Specifically, when elected officials and state bureaucrats are favorably disposed towards a movement, minimally-assertive tactics will suffice; but when elected officials and state bureaucrats are hostile towards a movement, assertive tactics are necessary. In addition, if elected officials are favorable but state bureaucrats are hostile, or vice versa, movement organizations must target the hostile parties rather than the favorable ones.Halfmann, Drew. 2011.

Poulanassig Waterfall is located within the wood, west of the entrance, and can be viewed from the water's edge, or from a path above. It is a beautiful and scenic place, accessible to the public, and frequented by locals and visitors alike. Mullinhassig, is an anglicised place name of the Irish Muileann an Easaigh, meaning 'Mill of the Waterfall'. Lewis describes 'the glen of Mullinassig' as having beautiful and romantic scenery, its sides adorned with wood, and at its head a little mill, below which the river forms a cascade and a little lower falls into a beautiful lake. The 'romantic glen of Mullinassig' is also said to derive its name from a mill. Milner (1975) describes the 'lovely waterfall of Mullinhassig', interpreting Muileann Easaigh as 'the mill of the waterfall'. This particular premises was a fulling mill, which in later times was converted to a creamery, and a private residence now occupies the site. The 1842 surveyed OS map depicts a cataract, and correctly gives the name as 'Poulanassig'. This is Poulanassig Waterfall, generally regarded as Mullinhassig Waterfall and incorrectly named on informational signage. Mullinhassig Waterfall actually adjoins the mill site to the north-west of Poulanassig, and is correctly depicted on the 1842 surveyed OS map. The 1901 surveyed OS map also correctly names Poulanassig waterfall, and refers to the glen as Mullinhassig. Three waterfalls have existed in this area, and two remain (Mullinhassig & Poulanassig waterfalls). The Ordnance Survey (OS) name book (c. 1840) describes a small pond of water as 2 chains () north of Poulanassig in the River Clashgorrave, and at the mouth of which is (Mullinhassig) waterfall of about 18 feet. This pond was known as Good's pond, as depicted on the 1842 surveyed OS map, and so named after the landowner who ran an irrigation stream from the pond to his land. The OS name book also describes a pond of water in the River Clashagorrave c. 10 chains () south of Poulanassig, and, at its mouth, 12 foot Poulachourane Waterfall. This pond was Bowing's (Bowen's) Pond, constructed by Bowen of Oakgrove, with an irrigation stream leading from it to his land. This pond no longer exists and is now a wet, overgrown area, with a small stream running through. Neither does Poulachourane Waterfall exist, also depicted on the 1842 surveyed OS map. The Irish Tourist Association survey of 1944 advises that (Poulanassig) waterfall is a thirty foot cascade of the Glashnagarriff river, and a popular venue with visitors, and gives some local folklore. A mermaid in the form of a salmon is said to reside in the waterfall pool, who, if approached quietly in late evening, can be seen combing her hair on a stone 'stool' to the left of the waterfall. If a stranger is sensed, she dives to the bottom of the pool. Near the brink of the waterfall is a boulder, said to be the mermaid's 'table'. Another version has the mermaid enticing unwary anglers to the bottom of the pool, where they spend the rest of their existence releasing fish from the hooks of fellow anglers. This is said to be the reason why no fish are caught there, though the pool is 'full of salmon'. At the eastern end of Mullinhassig Wood is Aghavrin Clapper Bridge. ==See also== *Aghavrin (townland) *Aghavrin House *Aghavrin Cottage *Aghavrin Clapper Bridge *Aghavrin Mass Rock *Crooke's Castle, Aghavrin *St Olan's, Aghavrin ==References * acrheritage.info Category:Waterfalls of the Republic of Ireland Category:Landforms of County Cork ","title":"Mullinhassig Wood &amp; Waterfalls, Aghavrin"},{"id":"41967434","text":"Follicular hyperplasia is a type of lymphoid hyperplasia.

The last occupational ban for females in the military, which restricted women from serving aboard submarines, was lifted in 2001. Nonetheless, women constitute a mere 2.4% of combat arms, and there are currently no women that serve in combat specialties within special operations forces.Harries-Jenkins, Gwyn ‚ÄúInstitution to Occupation to Diversity, Gender in the Military Today‚Äù in Franklin C.

Females who obtain officer status are mainly concentrated in the personnel and nursing fields. ==Historical overview of women in the Canadian Armed Forces== Women have played a role in the Canadian Forces for over 100 years. During World War II, women were restricted to non-combative positions such as nursing, cooking, communication, logistics, and administration.Franklin C. Pinch, Allister T. MacIntyre, Phyllis Browne, Alan C. Okros. ‚ÄúChallenge and Change in the Military: Gender and Diversity Issues.‚Äù (2004) Kingston, Ontario: Canadian Defence Academy Press, at p.30. In 1971, following the recommendations from the Royal Commission on the Status of Women, the Canadian Armed Forces sought to expand the range of positions women could fill. Due to this expansion, women became employable as vehicle drivers and mechanics, aircraft mechanics, air-traffic controllers, military police, and firefighters. When the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms came into force in 1985, the Canadian Armed Forces‚Äô policies were amended to allow women to serve at sea, in army service battalions, field ambulance units, and in most air squadrons. By 1987, women were permitted to occupy direct combat posts on the ground and at sea. While equality legislation was being passed, the Defense Minister conducted many trials on Service Women in Non- Traditional Environments and Roles, known as the SWINTER Trials. The minister sought to examine women's performance at positions typically reserved for males, as well as how the mixed gender group performed as a whole, in order to ascertain whether operative efficiency was undermined.Gauthier v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces) [1989] C.H.R.D. No. 3 [1989] D.C.D.P. No 3 at para 37. ==Efforts towards equalityAchieving equal opportunity through legislation=== Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms came into force in 1982, and with it came the equality rights guarantees of Section 15. To assert such a right, a claimant must allege that there was discrimination based on an ‚Äúenumerated ground‚Äù, or grounds analogous to those cited. To date, nobody has used Section 15 of the Charter to commence an action against the Canadian Armed Forces on gender discrimination charges. There was, however, a claim against the Canadian Armed Forces for discrimination based on sexual orientation.Haig v. Canada[1992] O.J. No. 1609 94 D.L.R. (4th) The Canadian Human Rights Act The Canadian Human Rights Act is considered quasi-constitutional legislation, and applies to federal government agencies and Crown corporations including the Canadian Armed Forces.Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c H-6 s.63. It acts to prohibit discrimination on specified grounds, such as race, sex, age, religion, and in the context of employment and publicly available services.Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c H-6 s.63. ===Achieving Equal Opportunity Through Litigation=== In Gauthier v. Canadian Armed Forces, three women brought claims before a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal alleging that the Canadian Armed Forces had refused them employment on the basis of their gender, and that this was inconsistent with the Human Rights Act. The Canadian Armed Forces conceded that their policies were discriminatory, but relied on section 15(1)(a) to argue that they should be granted an exception based on a bona fide occupational requirement. They claimed that including women in certain specialized roles could undermine ‚Äúoperational effectiveness‚Äù and pose too much risk.Gauthier v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces) [1989] C.H.R.D. No. 3 [1989] D.C.D.P. No 3 at para 1. Isabelle Gauthier, a claimant working for the reserves, was refused a request to transfer location, because her desired location had already reached its 10% female quota. Following the complaint, the Canadian Armed Forces modified their policy to allocate reserve force positions based on susceptibility to combat or operational duty rather than gender. The Tribunal ordered the Canadian Armed Forces pay to the complainant $1,000 for suffering and loss of dignity in being refused employment, and $5,481 for lost wages.Gauthier v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces) [1989] C.H.R.D. No. 3 [1989] D.C.D.P. No 3 at para 123. Marie-Claude Gauthier, a second claimant, was qualified to be a marine engineering technician, but was not permitted entry since the trade was not open to women. She relied on sections 5a and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which forbid denying a service and depriving employment opportunities on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination. The tribunal ordered that the marine engineering technician program be open to women who meet the required educational level and have enrolled in the CAF.Gauthier v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces) [1989] C.H.R.D. No. 3 [1989] D.C.D.P. No 3 at para 138. ===Efforts towards greater substantive equality=== By opening up all positions to female service members, the Canadian Armed Forces has taken a major step towards providing equal opportunity for women hoping to enter the military. Nonetheless, the number of females in the Canadian military falls well below their most recent target of 25.1% female representation. Other measures have been adopted that go beyond efforts aimed at achieving formal equality by accounting for biological differences between genders. The most often cited example of this differential treatment towards male and female soldiers has been with regards to the physical fitness evaluation for entry into the Canadian Armed Forces, where requirements are lowered substantially for female candidates.Government of Canada, National Defense and the Canadian Armed Forces. Online: http://cdn.forces.ca/_PDF2010/physical_fitness_en.pdfref>http://cdn.forces.ca/_PDF2010/physical_fitness_en.pdf. A number of proactive initiatives are also underway that are intended to bring about a greater substantive equality for women through \\"the elimination of discriminatory practices and attitudes, rather than granting special privileges and status\\". Recruiting The Canadian Armed Forces employs a system whereby they periodically reassess representation goals for women in different roles, and monitor progress towards achievement of those goals. They have recently begun an active recruiting campaign showing women in all Canadian Armed Forces positions in an effort to attract more women to combat roles. Efforts are also made through outreach activities to create awareness regarding potential career opportunities amongst women professionals and students. These, and other proactive measures are aimed at the recruitment, development, and retention of women in order to create a more diverse Canadian military. The Defence Diversity Council and Advisory Groups The Defence Diversity Council is a fundamental part of the effort to achieve diversity in the Canadian Armed Forces. This body is responsible for making recommendations to the Deputy Minister and Chief of Defense Staff on policies and practices pertaining to diversity. Being a federally regulated employer, the Canadian Armed Forces are subjected to the provisions of the Employment Equity Act, and have set up four diversity advisory group for each of the four groups cited in that act as being susceptible to discriminatory practices. (including women). The Defense Woman Advisory organization's primary objectives include consulting with women in the military so that they may ‚Äúprovide advice and insight to the leadership on issues relevant to their membership and implementation of employment equity‚Äù.Government of Canada, National Defense and the Canadian Armed Forces. Online: Both bodies are restricted to providing consultation and recommendations, as opposed to being direct participants in the policy and decision making process. ==Does gender discrimination still exist in the Canadian Military?== Fully integrating women into the Canadian Armed Forces has not been an easy task.Pinch, Franklin C, ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù in Franklin C. Pinch, Allister T. MacIntyre, Phyllis Browne, Alan C. Okros. Challenge and Change in the Military: Gender and Diversity Issues‚Äù (2004) Kingston, Ontario: Canadian Defence Academy Press, at p.2-4. Many of the issues still affecting female soldiers appear to be rooted in a conflict between sameness and difference. Whereas the Canadian Military has demonstrated their willingness to accommodate gender differences in some instances, this is not always the case. For example, both male and female candidates must carry a fifty-five pound rucksack for thirteen kilometres to meet the fitness requirements for basic infantry. This presents more of a challenge for women because the shape of the rucksack is ill fitted for a female's physique.Army Lessons Learned Centre. \\"Lessons Learned: Leadership in a Mixed Gender Environment.\\"(1998), Dispatches, 5(2). In this case, the Canadian Armed Forces adhered to the notion of sameness of treatment, whereby maleness was the norm and females were held to that standard. Recent Canadian studies indicate that women in combat roles are still subjected to an environment of non-acceptance.K. Davis and V. Thomas, Chief Land Staff Gender Integration Study: The Experience of Women Who Have Served in the Combat Arms, Sponsor Research Report 98-1 (Ottawa, Department of National Defence Personnel Research Team, 1998),7. One study suggests that this is the primary cause for women's attrition rates being four times higher than that of their male counterparts. Sexual harassment also constitutes a significant problem in the Canadian military, though the frequency of cited incidents has decreased since the 90's.Holden, Nicola J and Davis, Karen D. ‚ÄúHarassment in the Military: Cross-National Comparisons‚Äù, in Franklin C. Pinch, Allister T. MacIntyre, Phyllis Browne, Alan C. Okros. Challenge and Change in the Military: Gender and Diversity Issues‚Äù (2004) Kingston, Ontario: Canadian Defence Academy Press, at p.108-110.

Hometalk was listed among The Next Web's ‚Äúten of the best apps for home and work from 2012\\", and by the end of 2013, site visits increased from 2 million to over 4 million. In February, 2014, Hometalk members co-hosted live Pinterest parties at 100 Michael's stores throughout the United States, and then, two months later, Hometalk was listed as a Webby Award Honoree in the 18th annual Webby Awards. In 2016, Hometalk was voted #1 in The Next Web's list of \\"60 of the fastest growing companies in tech\\". Also in 2016, Hometalk made its first big push into Facebook video. The Wall Street Journal then featured the company's surge in video virality, citing its eco-friendly oven-cleaning video that garnered 38 million views in under three weeks. In October, another video surpassed 55 million views, and The Next Web cited a reason for the video's virality: \\"Perhaps the video embodies the very ethos of Hometalk: People empower and teach each other to make their homes better (without spending more money!).\\" Hometalk partnered with a talented group of video creators who have successfully driven well over a billion Facebook video views to over a thousand videos. (Hometalk's most popular video has 112 million views.) Hometalk has been monetizing its platform through programmatic advertising. But as for its future, Hometalk's CEO Ben Shaul explained: ‚ÄúOur mission is to become the end-to-end DIY destination, whereby we not only inspire people with awesome content, but we also empower them to do the projects themselves. This includes the ability to teach Hometalkers more DIY skills, to get them the relevant materials, and to connect them with each other to DIY together. Each of these initiatives has strong business components, too, which would enable us to diversify from our current revenue source - programmatic ads.‚Äù ==Community== Hometalk's attracts a targeted userbase of home and garden consumers: 95% are female, 94% are over the age of 35, and 85% reside in the USA. Hometalk has built a social network for DIYers. Unlike instructional videos on YouTube or the one-way communication on many how-to sites, Hometalk is a community where members can ask questions about projects and get responses within minutes. ==Media== Hometalk is often featured across various media outlets, such as Huffington Post, Country Living, Fox & Friends, NBC, and The Today Show. ==References * Category:American educational websites Category:Urban agriculture Category:How-to websites ","title":"Hometalk"},{"id":"41967894","text":"Lubero is a town in the North Kivu Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

The Historicist view follows a straight line of continuous fulfillment of prophecy which starts in Daniel's time and goes through John's writing of the Book of Revelation all the way to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.History of the Church of God, pp. 252, 253 (1876) One of the most influential aspects of the early Protestant historicist paradigm was the assertion that scriptural identifiers of the Antichrist were matched only by the institution of the Papacy. Particular significance and concern were the Papal claims of authority over both the Church, through Apostolic succession, and the State, through the Divine right of Kings. When the Papacy aspires to exercise authority beyond its religious realm into civil affairs, on account of the Papal claim to be the Vicar of Christ, then the institution was fulfilling the more perilous biblical indicators of the Antichrist. Martin Luther wrote this view, which was not novel, into the Smalcald Articles of 1537. It was then widely popularized in the 16th century, via sermons, drama, books, and broadside publication. The alternate methods of prophetic interpretation, Futurism and Preterism were derived from Jesuit writings, whose counter reformation efforts were aimed at opposing this interpretation\\"Jesuit scholarship rallied to the Roman cause by providing two plausible alternatives to the historical interpretation of the Protestants. 1. Luis de Alcazar (1554-1630) of Seville, Spain, devised what became known as the 'preterist' system of prophetic interpretation. This theory proposed that the Revelation deals with events in the Pagan Roman Empire, that antichrist refers to Nero and that the prophecies were therefore fulfilled long before the time of the medieval church. Alcazar's preterist system has never made any impact on the conservative, or evangelical wing of the Protestant movement, although in the last one hundred years it has become popular among Protestant rationalists and liberals. 2. A far more successful attack was taken by Francisco Ribera (1537‚Äì1591) of Salamanca, Spain. He was the founder of the 'futurist' system of prophetic interpretation. Instead of placing antichrist way in the past as did Alcazar, Ribera argues that antichrist would appear way in the future. About 1590 Ribera published a five hundred page commentary on the Apocalypse, denying the Protestant application of antichrist to the church of Rome.\\" M.L.

Joseph Tanner, Daniel and the Revelation, pp. 16, 17. that the Antichrist was the Papacy or the power of the Roman Catholic Church.The Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, vol. 4 [4BC], 42.) ==Origins in Judaism and Early Church== The interpreters using the historicist approach for Revelation had their origins in the Jewish apocalyptic writings such as we see in the book of Daniel, which predicted the future the time between their writing and the end of the world. Throughout most of history since the predictions of the book of Daniel, historicism has been widely used. This approach can be found in the works Josephus who interpreted the fourth kingdom of Daniel 2 as the Roman empire with a future power as the stone \\"not cut by human hands\\", that would overthrow the Romans.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 10:10, in William Whiston, trans., The Works of Josephus: Complete and Unabridged (Peabody: Hendrickson, 1988), pages = 280; cf. Froom 1:199. We also find it in the early church in the works of Irenaeus (and Tertullian) who interpreted the fourth kingdom of Daniel as the Roman empire and believed that in the future it was going to be broken up into smaller kingdoms, as the iron mixed with clay.28Irenaeus, Against Heresies, book 5, chap. 26, in Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson, eds., Ante-Nicene Fathers (Edinburgh: T & T Clark, 1885 [reprint 1989]), 1:554√ê555; cf. Froom 1:244√ê245, pages = 407. It is also found in the interpretations in the writings of Clement of Alexandria, and JeromeGleason L. Archer, trans., Jerome's Commentary on Daniel (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1958), 32 as well as other well known church historians and scholars of the early church. But it has particularly been associated with Protestantism and the Reformation, and was the standard interpretation from Lollard movement which was regarded as the precursor to the Protestant Reformation, and was known as the Protestant interpretation until modern times. ==Antichrist== Lucas Cranach, commissioned by Martin Luther.Luther's Last Battles: Politics And Polemics 1531-46 By Mark U. Edwards, Jr. Fortress Press, 2004. \\"Kissing the Pope's feet\\";HIC OSCULA PEDIBUS PAPAE FIGUNTUR German peasants respond to a papal bull of Pope Paul III. Caption reads: \\"Don't frighten us Pope, with your ban, and don't be such a furious man. Otherwise we shall turn around and show you our rears\\".\\"Nicht Bapst: nicht schreck uns mit deim ban, Und sey nicht so zorniger man. Wir thun sonst ein gegen wehre, Und zeigen dirs Bel vedere\\"Mark U. Edwards, Jr., Luther's Last Battles: Politics And Polemics 1531-46 (2004), p. 199 Passional Christi und Antichristi, by Lucas Cranach the Elder, from Luther's 1521 Passionary of the Christ and Antichrist. The Pope as the Antichrist, signing and selling indulgences. Protestant Reformers, including John Wycliffe, Martin Luther, John Calvin, Thomas Cranmer, John Thomas, John Knox, Roger Williams, Cotton Mather, Jonathan Edwards, and John Wesley, as well as most Protestants of the 16th18th centuries, felt that the Early Church had been led into the Great Apostasy by the Papacy and identified the Pope with the Antichrist. The Centuriators of Magdeburg, a group of Lutheran scholars in Magdeburg headed by Matthias Flacius, wrote the 12-volume Magdeburg Centuries to discredit the Catholic Church and lead other Christians to recognize the Pope as the Antichrist. So, rather than expecting a single Antichrist to rule the earth during a future Tribulation period, Martin Luther, John Calvin, and other Protestant Reformers saw the Antichrist as a present feature in the world of their time, fulfilled in the Papacy. Like most Protestant theologians of his time, Isaac Newton believed that the Papal Office (and not any one particular Pope) was the fulfillment of the Biblical predictions about Antichrist, whose rule was predicted to last for 1,260 years. Differently, the Church Fathers identified the Antichrist with one or more Popes, but not with the Pontifical institution itself, to say with all the Apostolic succession from St Peter onwards. Among those who interpreted the Biblical prophecy historistically there were: Justin Martyr who wrote about the Antichrist: \\"He Whom Daniel foretells would have dominion for a time and times and an half, is even now at the door\\".Dialogue with Trypho, ch. 32, in Ante-Nic. Fath. I:210. Irenaeus wrote in Against Heresies about the coming of the Antichrist: \\"This Antichrist shall ... devastate all things ... But then, the Lord will come from Heaven on the clouds ... for the righteous\\".Against Heresies, III: 7:2, in Ante-Nic. Fath. Ib., V:30:3-4. Tertullian looking to the Antichrist wrote: \\"He is to sit in the temple of God, and boast himself as being god. In our view, he is Antichrist as taught us in both the ancient and the new prophecies; and especially by the Apostle John, who says that 'already many false-prophets are gone out into the world' as the fore-runners of Antichrist\\".Against Marcion, V:16, in Ante-Nic. Fath. III:463f. Hippolytus of Rome in his Treatise on Christ and Antichrist wrote: \\"As Daniel also says (in the words) 'I considered the Beast, and look! There were ten horns behind it ‚Äì among which shall rise another (horn), an offshoot, and shall pluck up by the roots the three (that were) before it.' And under this, was signified none other than Antichrist.\\"Treatise on Christ and Antichrist, chs. 25 to 63, in Ante-Nic. Fath. V:209-18.Fragments from Commentaries, 2:1-3, in Ante-Nic. Fath. V:178. Athanasius of Alexandria clearly hold to the historical view in his many writings; in The Deposition of Arius, he wrote: \\"I addressed the letter to Arius and his fellows, exhorting them to renounce his impiety.... There have gone forth in this diocese at this time certain lawless men ‚Äì enemies of Christ ‚Äì teaching an apostasy which one may justly suspect and designate as a forerunner of Antichrist\\".The Deposition of Arius, paras. 2 & 4, in Nic. & Post-Nic. Fath., 2nd Ser., IV:69. Jerome wrote: \\"Says the apostle [Paul in the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians], 'Unless the Roman Empire should first be desolated, and antichrist proceed, Christ will not come.'\\" Jerome claimed that the time of the break-up of Rome, as predicted in Daniel 2, had begun even in his time.Jerome, Commentary on Daniel 2:40, as found in Gleason L. Archer, trans., Jerome's Commentary on Daniel (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1958), 32; cf. Froom 1:442√ê443. He also identifies the Little horn of and which \\"shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and shall think to change the times and the law\\" as the Papacy.Clarke, Adam. Commentary on the Old Testament, Vol. IV, p. 596. Some Franciscans had considered the Emperor Frederick II a positive Antichrist who would purify the Catholic Church from opulence, riches and clergy. Some of the debated features of the Reformation's Historicist interpretations reached beyond the Book of Revelation. They included the identification of: * the Antichrist (1 and 2 John); * the Beast of Revelation 13; * the Man of Sin, or Man of Lawlessness, of 2 Thessalonians 2 (); * the \\"Little horn\\" of Daniel 7 and 8; * The Abomination of desolation of Daniel 9, 11, and 12; and * the Whore of Babylon of Revelation 17. The Protestant Reformers tended to hold the belief that the Antichrist power would be revealed so that everyone would comprehend and recognize that the Pope is the real, true Antichrist and not the vicar of Christ. Doctrinal works of literature published by the Lutherans, the Reformed Churches, the Presbyterians, the Baptists, the Anabaptists, and the Methodists contain references to the Pope as the Antichrist, including the Smalcald Articles, Article 4 (1537), the Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope written by Philip Melanchthon (1537),Philip Melanchthon, Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope (full text) in the Triglot translation of the Book of Concord. the Westminster Confession, Article 25.6 (1646), and the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith, Article 26.4. In 1754, John Wesley published his Explanatory Notes Upon the New Testament, which is currently an official Doctrinal Standard of the United Methodist Church. In his notes on the Book of Revelation (chapter 13), he commented: \\"The whole succession of Popes from Gregory VII are undoubtedly Antichrists. Yet this hinders not, but that the last Pope in this succession will be more eminently the Antichrist, the Man of Sin, adding to that of his predecessors a peculiar degree of wickedness from the bottomless pit.\\"Archived copy at the Library of Congress (May 8, 2009). The identification of the Pope with the Antichrist was so ingrained in the Reformation Era, that Luther himself stated it repeatedly: and, John Calvin similarly wrote: John Knox wrote on the Pope: Thomas Cranmer on the Antichrist wrote: John Wesley, speaking of the identity given in the Bible of the Antichrist, wrote: Roger Williams wrote about the Pope: The identification of the Roman Catholic Church as the apostate power written of in the Bible as the Antichrist became evident to many as the Reformation began, including John Wycliffe, who was well-known throughout Europe for his opposition to the doctrine and practices of the Catholic Church, which he believed had clearly deviated from the original teachings of the early Church and to be contrary to the Bible. Wycliffe himself tells (Sermones, III. 199) how he concluded that there was a great contrast between what the Church was and what it ought to be, and saw the necessity for reform. Along with John Hus, they had started the inclination toward ecclesiastical reforms of the Catholic Church. When the Swiss Reformer Huldrych Zwingli became the pastor of the Grossm√ºnster in Zurich (1518) he began to preach ideas on reforming the Catholic Church. Zwingli, who was a Catholic priest before he became a Reformer, often referred to the Pope as the Antichrist. He wrote: \\"I know that in it works the might and power of the Devil, that is, of the Antichrist\\".Principle Works of Zwingli, Vol. 7, p. 135. The English Reformer William Tyndale held that while the Roman Catholic realms of that age were the empire of Antichrist, any religious organization that distorted the doctrine of the Old and New Testaments also showed the work of Antichrist. In his treatise The Parable of the Wicked Mammon, he expressly rejected the established Church teaching that looked to the future for an Antichrist to rise up, and he taught that Antichrist is a present spiritual force that will be with us until the end of the age under different religious disguises from time to time.Tyndale, William, Parable of the Wicked Mammon, c. 1526, (facsimile copy of later printing, no ISBN number, Benediction Classics, 2008) at pages 4-5. Tyndale's translation of 2 Thessalonians, chapter 2, concerning the \\"Man of Lawlessness\\" reflected his understanding, but was significantly amended by later revisers,\\"Tyndale's Doctrine of Antichrist and His Translation of 2 Thessalonians 2\\", R. Davis, New Matthew Bible Project; a shorter version of this article was also published in the Tyndale Society Journal No. 36, Spring 2009, under the title Tyndale, the Church, and the Doctrine of Antichrist). including the King James Bible committee, which followed the Vulgate more closely. Exactly as prophecy had given, in 1798 Pope Pius VI was taken prisoner by the armies of Napoleon I, and died in captivity in France, and it appeared the Papacy had been dealt a death blow, or its power taken or wounded and yet it was restored: \\"One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled as they followed the Beast\\" (). In 1870, the newly formed Kingdom of Italy annexed the remaining Papal States, depriving the Pope of his temporal power. However, the Papal rule over Italy was later restored by the Italian Fascist regime (albeit on a greatly diminished scale) in 1929 as head of the Vatican City state; under Mussolini's dictatorship, Roman Catholicism became the State religion of Fascist Italy (see also Clerical fascism), and the Racial Laws were enforced to outlaw and persecute both Italian Jews and Protestant Christians,; especially Evangelicals and Pentecostals. Thousands of Italian Jews and a small number of Protestants died in the Nazi concentration camps. Today, many Protestant and Restorationist denominations still officially maintain that the Papacy is the Antichrist, such as the conservative Lutheran ChurchesNolting, Paul F., The Antichrist (part 1) A Brief Statement of our Doctrinal Position, 1932 and the Seventh-day Adventists...... In 1988 Ian Paisley, Evangelical minister and founder of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, made headlines with such a statement about Pope John Paul II. The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod states about the Pope and the Catholic Church: ==Seven churches== The non-separatist Puritan, Thomas Brightman, was the first to propose a historicist interpretation of the Seven Churches of Revelation 2‚Äì3.. He outlined how the seven Churches represent the seven ages of the Church of Christ. A typical historicist view of the Church of Christ spans several periods of church history, each similar to the original church, as follows: # The age of Ephesus is the apostolic age. # The age of Smyrna is the persecution of the Church through AD 313. # The age of Pergamus is the compromised Church lasting until AD 500. # The age of Thyatira is the rise of the papacy to the Reformation. # The age of Sardis is the age of the Reformation. # The age of Philadelphia is the age of evangelism. # The age of Laodicea represents liberal churches in a \\"present day\\" context. The age of Laodicea is typically identified as occurring in the same time period as the expositor. Examples of this is how Brightman viewed the age of Laodicea as the England of his day. In the Millerite movement, each church represented a dateable period of ecclesiastical history. Thus, William Miller dated the age of Laodicea from 1798‚Äì1843, followed by the End of days in 1844. ==Seven seals== The traditional historicist view of the Seven Seals spanned the time period from John of Patmos to Early Christendom. Protestant scholars such as, Campegius Vitringa, Alexander Keith, and Christopher Wordsworth did not limit the timeframe to the 4th century. Some have even viewed the opening of the Seals right into the early modern period. Seventh-day Adventists view the first six seals as representing events that took place during the Christian era up until 1844. Contemporary-historicists view all of Revelation as it relates to John's own time (with the allowance of making some guesses as to the future). ==Seven trumpets== The classical historicist view of the first four trumpets are identified with the pagan invasions of Western Christendom in the 5th century AD (by the Visigoths, Vandals, Huns and Heruli), while the fifth and sixth trumpets have been identified with the assault on Eastern Christendom by the Saracen armies and Turks during the Middle Ages.. The symbolism of Revelation 6:12‚Äì13 are said by Adventists to have been fulfilled in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the dark day of May 19, 1780, and the Leonids meteor shower of November 13, 1833. ==Vision of Chapter 10== The classical historicist view of the vision of the angel with the little book, in Revelation 10, represents the Protestant Reformation and the printing of Bibles in the common languages. The Adventists take a unique view applying it to the Millerite movement; the \\"bitterness\\" of the book (Rev 10:10) represents the Great Disappointment. ==Two witnesses== The classical historicist view takes a number of different perspectives, including that the two witnesses are symbolic of two insular Christian movements, such as the Waldenses, or that the Reformers are meant, or the Old Testament and the New Testament. It is usually taught that Revelation 11 corresponds to the events of the French Revolution. ==Beasts of Revelation== The historicist views of Revelation 12‚Äì13 concern prophecies about the forces of evil viewed to have occurred in the middle ages. The first beast of Revelation 13 (from the sea) is considered to be the pagan Rome and the Papacy or more exclusively the latter.. In 1798, the French General Louis Berthier exiled the Pope and took away all his authority, which was restored in 1813, destroyed again in 1870 and later restored in 1929. Adventists have taken this as fulfillment of the prophecy that the Beast of Revelation would receive a deadly wound but that the wound would be healed. They have attributed the wounding and resurgence in to the papacy, referring to General Louis Berthier's capture of Pope Pius VI in 1798 and the pope's subsequent death in 1799. Adventists view the second beast (from the earth) symbolizes the United States of America. The \\"image of the beast\\" represents Protestant churches who form an alliance with the Papacy, and the \\"mark of the beast\\" refers to a future universal Sunday law.Seventh-day Adventists Believe (2nd ed), pp. 190‚Äì97, 382 Both Adventists and classical historicists view the Great whore of Babylon, in Revelation 17‚Äì18, as Roman Catholicism.Seventh-day Adventists believe (2nd ed). ==Number of the Beast== Passional Christi und Antichristi, by Lucas Cranach the Elder, from Luther's 1521 Passionary of the Christ and Antichrist. The Pope is signing and selling indulgences. Adventists have interpreted the number of the beast, 666, as corresponding to the title Vicarius Filii Dei of the Pope. In 1866, Uriah Smith was the first to propose the interpretation to the Seventh-day Adventist Church. In The United States in the Light of Prophecy, he wrote: Prominent Adventist scholar J. N. Andrews also adopted this view.The Three Angels of Revelation XIV. 6-12, p.109. 1877 reprint. Cited from Adventist Bible Commentary Uriah Smith maintained his interpretation in the various editions of Thoughts on Daniel and the Revelation, which was influential in the church.Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, 223 Various documents from the Vatican contain wording such as \\"Adorandi Dei Filii Vicarius, et Procurator quibus numen aeternum summam Ecclesiae sanctae dedit\\",Decree of Paul VI elevating the Prefecture Apostolic of Bafia, Cameroon, to a Diocese: Acta Apostolicae Sedis, Commentarium Officiale, vol. LX (1968), n. 6, pp. 317-319. Libreria Editrice Vaticana. . which translates to \\"As the worshipful Son of God's Vicar and Caretaker, to whom the eternal divine will has given the highest rank of the holy Church\\". The New Testament was written in Koine Greek, Adventists used Roman numerals to calculate the value of \\"Vicarius Filii Dei\\" whose word is in Latin language. \\"Vicarius Filii Dei\\" is in Latin and it does not exist in the New Testament which was written in koine greek. Samuele Bacchiocchi, an Adventist scholar, and only Adventist to be awarded a gold medal by Pope Paul VI for the distinction of summa cum laude (Latin for \\"with highest praise\\"),http://www.adventistarchives.org/docs/AAR/AAR19751027-V80-43__C.pdf#view=fit has documented the pope using such a title:http://www.biblicalperspectives.com/endtimeissues/et_145.htmhttp://www.biblicalperspectives.com/endtimeissues/et_146.htm However, that said, Bacchiocchi's general conclusion regarding the interpretation of Vicarius Filii Dei is that he, together with many current Adventist scholars,Ekkehardt Mueller, \\"The Beast of Revelation 17‚ÄìA Suggestion\\"Andrews Study Bible note on Rev. 13:18: \\"God's number in Revelation is seven, so multiples of the number six may represent and emphasize counterfeit and falling short\\" (Dybdahl, J.

He was active in sports, especially football and cricket. Hubback was promoted to brigadier general during his service in the British Army. ==Early life== Arthur Hubback was born at 74 Rodney Street, Liverpool, England, son of Joseph Hubback (1814‚Äì1882), who was Mayor of Liverpool in 1870 and a merchant, and Georgina Hubback (n√©e Benison and widow of Captain Allan Eliott Lockhart). Arthur attended Fettes College, Edinburgh, and then started work as an apprentice for the city architect in Liverpool, Thomas Shelmerdine. ==Career in architecture== Sultan Abdul Samad Building, first major work in Malaya A. B. Hubback was involved in In 1895, Hubback became chief draughtsman of Selangor public works department, which was then working on the building of government offices now known as Sultan Abdul Samad Building. The Sultan Abdul Samad Building was originally designed by A.C. Norman and R. A. J. Bidwell in a Classic Renaissance style, but Norman's plan was then reworked on by Bidwell in an Indo-Saracenic or Moorish style. After Bidwell left, Hubback also worked on the building. After the building was completed in 1897, he worked in private practice for a few years, before returning to public work in 1901. Kuala Lumpur Railway Station (right) and Malay Railway Administration Building (left), both by Hubback From then until the outbreak of World War I was a period of great construction projects, and he worked on buildings in Malaya and Hong Kong, from mosques to railway stations. An important work designed by Hubback is the Kuala Lumpur railway station. Among other major works he designed are the Jamek Mosque, Kowloon railway station, and Ipoh railway station. He designed at least 25 buildings in Malaya, and many of these are now considered an important part of the architectural heritage of Malaysia. He returned to England in 1914 and did not design any further buildings in Malaya, although some of his buildings were not completed until later. ==Military service== Hubback took charge in the Federated Malay States Volunteer Rifles Force (M.S.V.R.) in 1907. He was appointed as a major in the M.S.V.R. in 1910 and he was in command of F.M.S. Contingent to George V's coronation in 1911. He was then promoted as lieutenant colonel in the M.S.V.R. in 1912. In 1914, at the start of World War I, he became a major in the 19th battalion, London (territorial) regiment. In 1915, he was the lieutenant colonel commanding the 20th London Regiment Territorial Force, 47th Division B.E.F. He served in France, fought on the Somme and was wounded. He became brigadier general of 2nd Infantry Brigade, 1st Division in 1916, and brigadier general commanding of the 63rd Infantry Brigade, 37th Division B.E.F. in 1918. During the war he was mentioned in dispatches six times, and won the CMG and Distinguished Service Order. Following the war he continued in the military, commanding the 5th London infantry brigade of the territorial army from 1920 to 1924. He then retired, but attempted to rejoin at the outbreak of the Second world War and was turned down due to his age. He ran instead the Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's Family Association in Hertfordshire to look after the families of the armed forces. ==Family== Hubback married Margaret Rose Frances (Daisy) Voules, the sister of a colleague, in 1901 and they had two children, a son (Arthur Gordon Voules Hubback, R.N.) and a daughter (Yvonne Hubback). He had two brothers. Theodore Rathbone Hubback joined Arthur in Malaya, and was a civil engineer and contractor, as well as working for a while as a rubber planter, and after early adventures as a big game hunter became a conservationist and author. George Clay Hubback was bishop of Assam and of Calcutta. He died in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, on 8 May 1948 of heart failure. ==Buildings== Old Town Hall of Kuala Lumpur Jamek Mosque Hubback worked on the following buildings: * (1894‚Äì1897) ** Federal Secretariat (Sultan Abdul Samad Building), ground plan based on A.

One style of his architecture may be known as Indo-Saracenic, which is a blend of Mughal forms with Byzantine, Romanesque, and Gothic details. The first major work Hubback was involved in, the Sultan Abdul Samad Building, is in this style. It was largely the work by R. A. J. Bidwell following the design direction set by the State Engineer Charles Edwin Spooner, and Hubback made additions and alterations to the building under Spooner's instructions. This strand of English colonial architecture was based on Indian Islamic architecture and not native to Malaya. Hubback and Bidwell effectively introduced into the Malaysian architectural vocabulary the onion dome. The Federal Secretariat/Sultan Abdul Samad Building formed the perimeter of the Padang or Merdeka Square is as much a part of the architectural consciousness of Malaysia as the Houses of Parliament is to Britain. Many of his buildings, such as the Railway Station and Jamek Mosque, are landmarks in Kuala Lumpur. The twentieth-century quality of his architectural output is that he created a number of large buildings to house the colonial government's administrative functions, an architectural recognition of the increasing spatial demands of an official bureaucracy, but in elegant dress. While in post-independence Malaysia these functions have moved elsewhere, these buildings remain as a potent visual symbol of the country and its multicultural heritage. ==Honours== * 1905 Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects * 1909 Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects * 1913 Honorary Diocesan Architect for the Diocese of Singapore * 1916 Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George * 1918 Distinguished Service Order. ==Sports== Hubback was an active sportsman who played the following sport:A.B.

It has hanging stems, cylindrical leaves and groups of about six yellowish or orange-brown flowers with red streaks and a white labellum. It is only known from two mountainous areas north of Cairns. ==Description== Dendrobium brevicaudum is an epiphytic or lithophytic herb with pendulous stems and leaves. The stems are dark green to yellowish, wide and up to long. The leaves are cylindrical, dark green long and wide. Between five and eight flowers are arranged on a flowering stem long. The flowers are yellowish, brownish or orange-brown, long and wide with red streaks along the cente. The dorsal sepal is more or less erect, elliptic to egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped, curved long and about wide. The petals are linear to narrow lance-shaped, long and about wide. The labellum is whitish, long, wide, is covered with short hairs and has three lobes. The side lobes are triangular and upright and the middle lobe is very wavy with three dark red ridges along its midline. Flowering occurs from December to January. ==Taxonomy and naming== Dendrobium brevicaudum was first formally described in 1994 by David Jones and Mark Clements from a specimen collected on Mount Finnigan in the Ngalba Bulal National Park. The specific epithet (brevicaudum) is derived from the Latin words brevis meaning \\"short\\" and cauda meaning \\"tail\\" referring to the short tip of the labellum. ==Distribution and habitat== The Mount Finnigan pencil orchid grows on trees and granite boulders in rainforest and cloud forest at an elevation of above about on Mount Finnigan and nearby Mount Misery. ==References== brevicaudum Category:Orchids of Queensland Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Plants described in 1994 ","title":"Dendrobium brevicaudum"},{"id":"41968328","text":"Blue Eagle was a settlement founded in the 1870s on what is now the west side of Westbrook, Minnesota, United States. ==References== Category:Former populated places in Minnesota Category:Former populated places in Cottonwood County, Minnesota ","title":"Blue Eagle, Minnesota"},{"id":"41968372","text":"Barbicornis is a monotypic butterfly genus of the family Riodinidae with its single species Barbicornis basilis present in Paraguay, Brazil and Argentina.

The tribe is spread across the Middle East, and is prominent in the villages of the Golan Heights and the Quneitra countryside. Prior to the Syrian Civil War, Noeimi served as a career officer in the Syrian Army where he was Brigadier General. ==Syrian Civil War== Noeimi defected from the Syrian Army on 13 July 2012, alongside several other officers from the Noeimi tribe, including Adnan al-Rafi, Saleh al-Hammada al-Noeimi, and Saleh Bashir al-Noeimi. He was later appointed Chief of the FSA Military Council in Quneitra. Noeimi has called for support from the European Union and the United States, either through the supply of weapons, or through direct military intervention. Noeimi has also met with Iranian opposition groups such as the MEK, and has expressed his support for the overthrow of the Iranian government and the velayat-e faqih style of governance. His son, Talal, was killed during clashes with the Syrian Army in the Quneitra countryside, on 26 November 2013. Noeimi was appointed to the position of Chief of Staff on 16 February 2014, taking over from Salim Idris. His appointment was confirmed by the FSA on 8 March 2014.

At 15, he was approached by teams such as Arsenal, Everton, Tottenham and Stuttgart. Later, while still 15, he ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament. After the injury, he was offered the choice of going to Stuttgart or Germinal Ekeren, opting for the latter because he believed he would get more playing time. In 1997, he went on trial at Preston North End (which at the time was managed by David Moyes) and was offered a one-month contract which would be renewed on a monthly basis (due to Gu√∞mundur's record of injury problems). Gu√∞mundur rejected the deal, as he had a newborn (his son Albert) and needed more long- term security. After a stint at Geel in 2000, Gu√∞mundur had serious knee problems, leading him to play irregularly for KR in the subsequent years. In one season during the 2000-2004 period, he was assistant coach at KR when Willum √û√≥r √û√≥rsson coached the team. He retired from playing 2009 and he started a career as a football manager. ==National team career== He made his debut for Iceland in 1994 against the United Arab Emirates, and scored in the game.

Feminist Practice & Poststructuralist Theory. Oxford: Blackwell. pp. 195. . theories of feminist post-structuralism, and developed as a method of analysis by Judith BaxterBaxter, Judith (2003). Positioning Gender in Discourse: A Feminist Methodology. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan. pp. 215. . in 2003. FPDA is based on a combination of feminism and post-structuralism. While it is still evolving as a methodology, FPDA has been used by a range of international scholars of gender and language to analyse texts such as: classroom discourse (Casta√±eda-Pe√±a 2008;Castaneda-Pena, Harold-Andres (2008). Gender and Language Research Methodologies. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan. pp. 256-270. . Sauntson 2012Sauntson, Helen (2012). Approaches to Gender and Spoken Classroom Discourse. Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan. pp. 248. .), teenage girls' conversation (Kamada 2008;Kamada, Laurel (2008). Gender and Language Research Methodologies. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan. pp. 174-192. 2010Kamada, Laurel (2010). Hybrid Identities and Adolescent Girls: Being Half in Japan. Bristol: Multilingual Matters. pp. 258. ), and media representations of gender (Baker 2013Baker, Paul (2013). The Bloomsbury Companion to Discourse Analysis. London: Bloomsbury Academic. pp. 416. ). FPDA is an approach to analysing the discourse of spoken interaction principally. The poststructualist part of FPDA views language as social practice and considers that people's identities and relationships are 'performed' through spoken interaction. FPDA analyses the ways in which speakers are 'positioned' by different and often competing 'discourses' according to Michel Foucault's (1972: 49) definition as 'practices that systematically form the objects of which they speak'. According to this, speakers constantly move between powerful and powerless 'subject positions' as they talk and interact. FPDA is influenced by a poststructuralist rather than a Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) perspective: that is, the method is informed by the view that no speaker is wholly a victim and powerless, nor wholly dominant and powerful. Rather, speakers are constantly shifting their subject positions according to the interplay of discourses within specific settings. The feminist part of FPDA considers gender difference to be a dominant discourse among competing discourses when analysing all types of text. According to Baxter (2003), FPDA does not have an 'emancipatory' agenda for women but a 'transformative' one. This means that it aims to represent women's voices that have been 'silenced' or marginalised since FPDA considers that these have been historically absent in many cultures. For example, Kamada (2008a; 2008b and 2010) uses FPDA to show how a friendship group of half-Japanese girls, who are seen by their culture as 'less than whole', draw upon competing discourses to negotiate more positive versions of their 'hybrid' ethnic and gender identities. ==Background== The above definition of FPDA developed from the ideas of the formalist, Mikhail Bakhtin (1981)] and the poststructuralist thinkers Jacques Derrida (1987)] and Michel Foucault (1972) in relation to power, knowledge and discourses. It is also based on the feminist work of Victorial Bergvall (1998)], Judith Butler (1990), Bronwyn Davies (1997), Valerie Walkerdine (1990)] and especially Chris Weedon (1997). Adopters of FPDA include Judith Baxter in the analysis of classroom talk and business meeting interactions; Laurel Kamada (2008; 2008; 2010) in the analysis of 'hybrid' identities of half-Japanese girls, Harold Casta√±eda-Pe√±a (2008) in the examination of pupils in an EFL classroom in Brazil; Helen Sauntson in the analysis of UK secondary school classroom talk; and Paul Baker(2013) in the study of newspaper representations of predatory women. FPDA is based on the following principles, which continue to be discussed and debated by scholars: * Discourse as social practice (rather than, or additional to, ‚Äòlanguage above the sentence‚Äô or as ‚Äòlanguage in use‚Äô (Cameron, 2001) * The performative (rather than the essentialist or possessive) nature of speakers‚Äô identities; gender is something people enact or do, not something they are or characterise (Butler 1990) * The diversity and multiplicity of speakers‚Äô identities: thus, gender is just one of many cultural variables constructing speakers‚Äô identities (e.g. regional background, ethnicity, class, age), though it is still viewed as potentially highly significant * The construction of meaning within localised or context- specific settings or communities of practice such as classrooms, board meetings, TV talk shows * An interest in deconstruction: working out how binary power relations (e.g. males/females, public/private, objective/subjective) constitute identities, subject positions and interactions within discourses and texts, and challenging such binaries * Inter-discursivity: recognising ways in which one discourse is always inscribed and inflected with traces of other discourses, or how one text is interwoven with another * The need for continuous self-reflexivity: being continuously explicit and questioning about the values and assumptions made by discourse analysis. ==See also== * Post-structuralism * Discourse * Critical Discourse Analysis * Feminism * Feminist theory ==References Further reading == * Bakhtin, M.

Jewish law and custom prescribe ritual hand washing in a number of situations. This practice is generally known by the Hebrew term (), which literally means lifting up of the hands. The Talmud used the requirement of washing the hands in Leviticus 15:11 as a hint for general hand-washing law, using asmachta (a Biblical hint, rather than an explicit requirement). ==Occasions for hand washingBefore eating bread=== Halakha requires the hands to be washed before eating a meal containing bread. This washing was initially known as mayim rishonim (first waters), but is now commonly known simply as netilat yadayim (hand washing).Berachot 53b This only applies to bread made from one of the five chief grains (wheat, cultivated barley, spelt, wild barley, and oats).Shulhan Arukh (Orach Chaim 158:1) The washing is performed by pouring water from a cup over each hand. The Gemarah of the Babylonian Talmud contains homiletic descriptions of the importance of the practice, including an argument that washing before meals is so important that neglecting it is tantamount to unchastity, and risks divine punishment in the form of sudden destruction or poverty.Shabbat 62bSotah 4b Rabbinic law requires that travelers go as far as four biblical miles to obtain water for washing prior to eating bread, if there is a known water source there. This applies only to when the water source lies in one's direction of travel. However, had he already passed the water source, he is only obligated to backtrack to a distance of one biblical mile.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hil. Bikkurim 8:11; Jerusalem Talmud, Hallah 2:2; Babylonian Talmud, Pesahim 34a; ibid. 46a The one exception to this rule is when a man or a party of men are encamped while on a journey, and there is no water to be found in the vicinity of their camp, in which case the Sages of Israel have exempted them from washing their hands prior to breaking bread.Mishnah, Tractate Eruvin (end of chapter 1); cf. Maimonides' commentary there. ===After eating bread (Mayim Acharonim)=== Rabbinic sources discuss a practice to wash hands after a meal, before reciting Birkat Hamazon.Shulhan Arukh (Orach Chaim 181:1), based on the Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 53b and Hullin 105a‚Äîb. This practice is known as mayim acharonim (\\"after-waters\\"). According to the Talmud, the washing is motivated by health concerns, in order to remove the \\"salt of Sodom\\" which may have been served at the meal - as salt originating from the Sodom area allegedly causes blindness, should it be on one's fingers and they happen to touch their eyes.Chullin 105b; see also Berachot 53b where the purpose appears to be to sanctify one's hands before reciting Birkat Hamazon. The Rishonim reconcile these sources in various ways. The Talmud considered mayim acharonim obligatory,Chullin 105b and more important that washing before the meal.Yoma 83b Many, but not all, later sources agree.For example: Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 181:1 However, Tosafot ruled that mayim acharonim is not required in current circumstances, since the salt of Sodom is no longer served at meals.Tosafot, on Eruvin 17b, s.v. Similarly, R' Yaakov Emden ruled that it is not required, since nowadays it is customary to eat with forks and knives, and salt is unlikely to get on the fingers.Sefer Mor uKetziah (on the Tur) Based on these sources, in many communities nowadays mayim acharonim is not practiced.◊§◊†◊ô◊†◊ô ◊î◊ú◊õ◊î - ◊û◊ô◊ù ◊ê◊ó◊®◊ï◊†◊ô◊ù Nevertheless, many others continue to practice it. One reason to continue practicing it is the principle that if the underlying reason behind a rabbinic ruling no longer applies, the ruling is not automatically cancelled.For example: Maharal of Prague wrote as follows: \\"We entered into this discussion only to make the point that our Sages were extremely meticulous about after-meal washing and the consequence of ignoring it are worse than ignoring pre-meal washing. Therefore I declare that one must never, under any circumstance, flout the words of our Sages\\"; \\"An additional factor we must take into account that mitigates toward an after-meal washing obligation is that our Sages instructed us to eat salt (with bread) during every meal and so salt is, for us, a standard meal component\\" Another reason given the assertion that in every kor of salt, there is to be found a qurtov of salt of Sodom.This amounts to approximately 5.4 to 9.3 milliliters, a quantity still capable of blinding an individual. See HaRif on Tractate Hullin (ed. Yosef Qafih), Jerusalem 1960, p. 83 Although mayim acharonim was once not widely practiced (for example, until recently it did not appear in many Orthodox Passover Haggadahs) it has undergone something of a revival and has become more widely observed in recent years, particularly for special meals such as the Shabbat and Jewish holidays. No blessing is recited on this washing. Generally, only a small amount of water is poured over the outer two segments of the fingers,Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 181:4; Mishnah Berurah 181:10; Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 43:1 while a minority (primarily Yemenite Jews or related groups) wash the entire hand up to the wrist.Mishneh Torah, Hilkhoth Berakhoth 6:5 The water is sometimes poured from a special ritual dispenser. One should not pause between the washing and reciting birkat hamazon. Thematic interpretations Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook explained that our involvement in the physical act of eating has the potential to diminish our sense of holiness. To counteract this influence, we wash our hands after the meal. The Talmudic Sages spoke of washing away the \\"salt of Sodom\\" ‚Äì a place whose very name is a symbol of selfishness and indifference to others. \\"This dangerous salt, which can blind our eyes to the needs of others, is rendered harmless through the purifying ritual of mayim acharonim.\\" ===Before eating dipped fruit or vegetables=== Some sources speak of washing hands, prior to eating a piece of food which has been dipped in a liquid (e.g. water, honey, oil, etc.) which then clings to that piece, with the one exception of fruits, seeing that they do not require hand washing.Babylonian Talmud, Pesahim 115a While the Shulhan Arukh requires the washing of hands prior to eating fruits that are merely damp with one of the seven liquids,Orach Chaim 158:4 Maimonides does not mention this stringency in his Mishneh Torah.Hilchot Berakhot 6:1 Rabbi Hayim Kessar says that the enactment only applied to dipping fruits or vegetables in a liquid, but not when wetness merely clung to those fruits or vegetables.in his commentary \\"Baal Shem Tov\\" (ibid.) Nowadays this washing is not widely practiced, with one notable exception: During a Passover Seder, the hands are washed without reciting a blessing before eating karpas, a washing referred to as \\"Urchatz\\".Shulkhan Arukh, Orach Chayim 473:6 === Before worship === A sink for ritual hand- washing at the entrance to the Ramban Synagogue. According to the Shulchan Aruch, a person should wash both hands before prayer.Shulhan Arukh (Orach Chaim 92:4‚Äì5; 233:2), based on the Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 15a; see also: the Yemenite Jewish Prayer Book, TiklƒÅl Etz ·∏§ayim, with a commentary by Rabbi Yihya Saleh, and TiklƒÅl Qadmonim of Rabbi Yi·∏•ya al-Bashiri. This hand washing does not require the use of a cup (or similar vessel), though many have the custom to use a cup. No blessing is recited on this washing. If water cannot be obtained, the hands may be cleaned in another manner instead. As the Shacharit prayer is commonly recited shortly after awakening, many Jews rely on the handwashing upon awakening, and do not wash hands again before Shacharit. This washing is likened to the ritual purification required before entering the Temple in Jerusalem, in whose absence prayer, in Orthodox Judaism, serves in its place.Berakhot 15a === Before the Priestly Blessing === In Orthodox Judaism (and, in some cases, in Conservative Judaism), Kohanim, members of the priestly class, offer the Priestly Blessing before the congregation on certain occasions. Before performing their offices, they are required to wash their hands. Judaism traces this requirement to , which requires the priests to wash their hands before Temple service. The verse also refers to washing of feet, but this is generally not practiced in the absence of a Temple in Jerusalem. The water for this washing is commonly poured on the priests' hands by Levites, who also assist priests in other ways. In some communities priests do not wash their hands before the Priestly Blessing, the reasoning being that they have already washed hands upon awakening before the prayer.Shulhan Arukh (Orach Chaim 128:6). Cf. Rabbi Yaakov Castro's commentary, Erech Lechem (ibid.) === After sleeping === According to the Shulchan Aruch, a person who slept is required to wash upon arising, and says the netilat yadayim blessing. This ritual is known by the Yiddish term (, lit. \\"nail water\\"), and sometimes in Hebrew as Netilat Yadayim Shacharit. This Yiddish term is also used for a special cup used for such washing. The water is poured out from a vessel three times, intermittently, over each hand. Reasons given for this washing vary: to remove an evil spirit from one's fingers,Shulhan Arukh (Orach Chaim 4:2; 4:18), based on the Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 108b (end) ‚Äî 109a. or in preparation for the morning prayer, or to make the hands physically clean before reciting blessings and studying Torah.Cf. Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 11b. \\"R. Hiyya, the son of Ashi has said: 'Many times I would rise up [in the morning] to go before Rav in order to recite our readings in the Sifra of Rav's Beit Midrash. Rav would first proceed by washing his hands and blessing [over them], and only then would he recite for us the readings'.\\" Compare Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hil. Berakhot 6:2 This is performed when awaking from a full night's sleep, or even after a lengthy nap. The Talmud states God commanded Jews to wash the hands and provides the text of the netilat yadaim blessing still in use.Berakhot 60b ===Other occasions=== * After touching part of the body which is dirty or customarily covered such as the private parts, back, arm pits, inside of nose or ear, the scalp (but not if one just touched the hair), or the sweat from one's body (excluding the face), or one's shoesShulhan Arukh (Orach Chaim 4:18) * Upon leaving a latrine, lavatory or bathhouse, as a symbol of both bodily cleanliness and of removing human impurity. Handwashing after excretion is sometimes referred to as \\"washing asher yatzar\\", referring to the Asher yatzar blessing recited once the hands have been washed after excretion. * Upon leaving a cemetery * After cutting one's hair or nails * The Shulchan Aruch specifies that one must wash hands after sexual intercourse, but among many Orthodox Jews this is not accepted practice. * To remove tumat met (\\"impurity from death\\") after participating in a funeral procession or coming within four cubits of a corpse * Some have the custom of washing their hands prior to scribal work ==Laws of washing== Yemenite-Israeli boy rubs his hands after washing them (1949) Halakha (Jewish law) requires that the water used for ritual washing be naturally pure, unused, not contain other substances, and not be discoloured. === Blessing said before washing === A blessing is prescribed over hand washing before eating bread and when one wakes up from his sleep in the morning.Shulhan Arukh (Orach Chaim 4:1 and 158:1); Questions & Responsa of Rashba, vol. 1, responsum #191 Although Maimonides prescribes saying the blessing before one actually pours water over his hands,Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hil. Berakhot 6:2), in accordance with a teaching that says: \\"All of the commandments, entirely, one is to [first] make the blessing [over them prior to performing the act], and then he proceeds into their actual performance\\" (Sukkah 49a; Pesa·∏•im 7b). The author of Sefer Ha-Eshkol also required reciting the blessing before pouring water over one's hands, saying that any uncleanness which would not hinder one's prayer does not hinder the blessing said over hand washing (q.v. Sefer Ha-Eshkol, Berlin 1910, page 50 [Hebrew]). the custom has developed to recite the blessing only after he has poured water over his hands and has rubbed them together, while they are raised in the air to the height of his chin, prior to his drying them with a towel.Compare responsum of Hai Gaon quoted in Sefer Shaarei Teshuvah - 353 Geonic Responsa (Leipzig 1858), responsum 196 (Hebrew). The blessing text is as follows: \\"Blessed are you, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe, who has sanctified us through your commandments and has commanded us concerning the washing of hands\\" (). Immediately following the recital of the blessing, one must dry the hands with a towel or similar.Babylonian Talmud, Sotah 4b ===Manner of pouring the water=== In two of these hand washings, water is poured out over one's hands with the aid of a vessel: 1) upon waking from sleep, and 2) before eating bread.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Mikvaot 11:1 These hand washings are nearly always accompanied with a special blessing prior to concluding the actual act of washing (see infra). The basis of references in the Bible to this practice, e. g., Elisha pouring water upon the hands of Elijah. Water should be poured on each hand at least twice. A clean dry substance should be used instead if water is unavailable. The hand washing made when one leaves the lavatory or latrine, or when one touches his privy parts, or sweat, may be done simply with running tap water (faucet). Other methods have developed concerning over which hand one is to begin when pouring water over them. The general custom in the morning (based on a kabbalistic teaching) is to take-up the vessel in one's right hand, pass the vessel into his left hand, and only then begin to pour out water from that vessel over his right hand.Shulhan Arukh (Orach Chaim 4:10), based on the Zohar (P. Miqetz). See also Beit Yosef (section 4). Had one not followed the set order, it does not render his hand washing invalid. Then one reverses the order by taking-up the vessel in his right hand and pouring out water from that vessel over his left hand. This process is repeated altogether three times for each hand, with intermittent changing of hands after each pouring. When this is accomplished, he then takes the vessel and pours out water over both hands, simultaneously, after which he rubs his hands together and then lifts them to make the blessing over his hands, before he wipes them dry.Rabbi Yahya ·π¢ƒÅli·∏•, Tiklal ‚ÄòE·π£ ·∏§ayyim Hashalem (ed. Shimon Tzalach), vol. 1, Jerusalem 1971, p. 39a (Hebrew) In the hand washing made for eating bread, the custom differs: one takes the vessel in his right hand and pours water in abundance over his left hand. He then takes the vessel in his left hand and pours water in abundance over his right hand. In this case (for eating bread), it is not necessary to wash the hands three times, intermittently, as is customarily done in the morning. Rather, one or two pours for each hand are sufficient. ===Quantity of water=== Although the minimal quantity of water needed to fulfill one's religious duty is 1/4 of a log (a liquid measure of capacity equal to the bulk or volume of one and half medium-sized eggs),Tosefta Yadayim 1:1 and must be sufficient to cover at least the middle joints of one's fingers,Rabbi Avraham ben Nathan Hayar·∏•i, Sefer Hamanhig (the Guide), chapter \\"Halachot Se'udah\\", Jerusalem 1970, p. 57 water poured out in excess of this amount is considered praiseworthy in Jewish law. == Development of hand washing on bread == 1890 illustration of laver in the Temple The most developed and, perhaps, important of these washings is the washing of hands before eating bread. It is looked upon with such rigidity, that those who willfully neglect its practice are said to make themselves liable to excommunication,Babylonian Talmud, Berakhot 19a and bring upon themselves a state of scarcity,Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 62b and are quickly taken out of the world.Babylonian Talmud, Sotah 4b ===Hand washing in the Temple=== requires the priests to wash their hands and feet before offering sacrifices or entering the Tabernacle. According to , Solomon's Temple contained ten brazen lavers to allow for this washing. In addition, the Mishnah records that priests were required to wash hands and feet after urinating.Mishnah, Yoma 3:2; the word \\"urinating\\" is written with a euphemism, lit. \\"anyone who pours water.\\" See: Mishnah Yoma, chapter 3 The use of these lavers did not pertain to the general public, nor to their eating foods with washed hands. The Mishnah (Tractate Yadayim) is the first to describe the ritual of hand washing outside of the Temple. According to the Babylonian Talmud, King Solomon made an additional decree that priests must wash their hands before eating meat from animal sacrifices.Eruvin 21b, Shabbat 14b-15a === Hand washing for priests before eating terumah === Following the example of King Solomon, in the 1st or 2nd century CE, the Houses of Hillel and Shammai decreed the priests' hands to be ritually impure, which disqualified their eating terumah foods until washing those hands (as terumah may only be eaten while pure). This law was one of the eighteen new enactments made in the house of Hananiah ben Hezekiah ben Garon.Shabbat 13b It is recorded in Mishnah Bikkurim 2:1, which states that terumah and bikkurim \\"require the washing of the hands.\\" The Babylonian Talmud debates whether this decree was enacted by the Houses of Hillel and Shammai, or else by Hillel and Shammai themselves (in the year circa 32 BCEBased on the date given in the Talmud when Hillel emigrated from Babylon and came to Israel, being 100 years before the destruction of the Temple in 68 CE.). It concludes that Hillel and Shammai issued the decree but this was not commonly accepted; and later, the Houses of Hillel and Shammai reissued the degree and it was accepted.Shabbat 14b The Jerusalem Talmud states that Hillel and Shammai did not originate washing before eating terumah, but rather the requirement had existed in ancient times, and then was neglected and forgotten until Hillel and Shammai revived it.Shabbat 11a and Ketubbot 50b: While the law is of rabbinic origin, according to one opinion there is a hint (asmachta) to it in .Babylonian Talmud, Hullin 106a. Based on , Rava explained the verse as follows: \\"What is the meaning of that which is written, 'while he has not rinsed his hands in water?' Behold! Had he rinsed [his hands], would he be ritually clean?! Behold! He [still] requires an immersion [in a ritual bath]!! Rather, this is its meaning. After [he had immersed himself], so long as he has not yet rinsed [his hands], he is [still] unclean!\\" This enactment was made in order to instruct priests about the necessity of washing their hands after immersing their bodies in a mikveh, since the Torah requires priests to eat their consecrated foods in a state of ritual purity. Bodily purity can only be attained by, both, immersing themselves in a ritual bath as well as by washing their hands before consuming of such foods.  Grades of uncleanness  Halacha specifies a number of different levels of impurity; each level can result from touch by an object at one higher level. By this degree, all human hands automatically have second-level impurity (sheni letumah) until washed.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Avot HaTuma‚Äôot 8:2. Compare Mishnah Shabbat 1:4, Commentary of Rabbi Ovadiah da Bertinoro, ibid., s.v. the Seventh Decree. If (after washing) a person's hands touched a first-level impurity (rishon letumah), those hands become impure as far as the \\"pereq\\" (wrist), while the rest of his body remains pure.Maimonides, Mishneh Torah Hil. Avot HaTuma‚Äôot 8:1. Cf. Babylonian Talmud, Hullin 106a-b: \\"Our Rabbis have taught: 'The sanctification of the hands in the Temple precincts is unto the wrist, [but] for non-consecrated foods unto the joints [of the fingers]; for heave- offering, unto the wrist.'\\" All that is needed, therefore, is for him to wash his hands in water, and he removes thereby all uncleanness. === Hand washing for all Israelites === In subsequent years, many priests were ignoring the requirement to wash hands before touching terumah.Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 14b-15a To encourage the performance of this law, it was decreed that all Jews (priests and non-priests) must wash their hands before eating bread, even if that bread to be eaten was only ordinary non-terumah bread. According to the Babylonian Talmud,Shabbath 14a the underlying motive for this new enactment was because hands were considered \\"fidgety,\\" and apt to touch things. \\"Hence, unless their owner has taken care that they should not touch a ritually unclean object after he washed them, they are treated as unclean.\\"Hebrew- English Edition of Babylonian Talmud - Shabbath, (ed. Rabbi Dr. H. Freedman), The Soncino Press London 1987, s.v. Shabbath 14a, note 7 capable of rendering terumah invalid for consumption. This hand washing is referred to as serakh terumah ( meaning \\"[washing introduced] on account of terumah\\" and which is done for the sake of conformity);Babylonian Talmud, Hullin 106a as all Jews were now required to wash their hands before eating bread, it was expected that the delinquent priests too would wash their hands before eating 'terumah. The Jerusalem Talmud,Hagigah 13a (2:5) speaking more candidly about this subject, says explicitly: \\"Did they not decree [defilement] over the hands in order that he (i.e. the priest) might separate himself from the terumah? By saying to a man that his hands suffer a second-grade uncleanness, even so does he (the priest) separate himself from terumah.\\" Unwashed hands which suffer a second-grade uncleanness were capable of invalidating terumah given to the priests.Jacob Neusner, Eliezer Ben Hyrcanus: The Tradition and the Man, vol. 1, E.J. Brill/Leiden 1973, p. 316 (s.v. Comment) Others have explained hand washing as being merely for the sake of bodily cleanliness which, in turn, leads to ritual purity. Rabbi Hiyya the Great had commanded Rav (Abba Aricha) by saying: \\"If you are able to eat all throughout the year non-consecrated foods in a state of ritual purity, then eat! But if not, at least eat seven days out of the year [in such a state of ritual purity].\\" On account of these words, Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair would say: \\"...Bodily cleanliness leads to ritual purity.\\"Jerusalem Talmud, Shabbat 1:3 (8b) === External sources === It is unclear what sort of regulations were already in place during the late Second Temple period. A reference to hand washing is made in the Christian New Testament,Matthew 15:2; Mark 7:2 when the Pharisees asked Jesus why his disciples did not wash hands prior to eating bread. It is reported that \\"the Pharisees and all the Jews\\" considered this washing a \\"tradition of the elders\\",Mark 7:3 yet Jesus and the disciples did not do it - even though one proclaimed to be the Messiah might be expected to follow the highest standards for holy behavior. Thus, the disciples' non-observance may indicate that handwashing for bread was not universal at the time. Perhaps, handwashing was practiced by some Pharisaic schools of thought and not others (for example, by the School of Shammai and not the more lenient School of HillelTosefta Berakhot 6:3 records a similar dispute, where the School of Hillel disagrees with the School of Shammai and says that if there was a doubtful case of impure liquids on the hands, the hands are still considered pure.). == References  External links == * The Laws Upon Awakening in the Morning (Chabad) * Hand Washing, by Rabbi Louis Jacobs * A Short History of Jewish Handwashing Category:Hand Category:Hygiene Category:Jewish belief and doctrine Category:Jewish law Category:Jewish law and rituals Category:Jewish ritual purity law Category:Water and religion Category:Priesthood (Judaism) ","title":"Handwashing in Judaism"},{"id":"41968710","text":"Suphanburi Football Club Reserves and Academy () are the Reserve team of Suphanburi F.C.

The proposed complex would have replaced the former Twin Towers of the World Trade Center destroyed in the September 11 attacks, restoring the skyline of the city to its former state. The main design for the proposed complex would feature new landmark twin towers, nearly identical to the originals designed by Minoru Yamasaki, though it would feature 115 stories‚Äî5 floors taller than the originals, among other differences. Beside the towers, an above-ground memorial would have occupied the footprints of the original towers. The new site would also have featured three 12-story buildings, replacing the original 3, 4 and 5 World Trade Center. The complex was designed and developed by American architect Herbert Belton and American engineer Kenneth Gardner, and sponsored by Donald Trump. == Background (2001‚Äì2003) == After the September 11 attacks in 2001, several ideas about building new twin towers were discussed online and in the media. After the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC) launched the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition in 2002, seven architectural groups were commissioned by the organization to create a proposal to restore the Manhattan skyline. Out of the seven, four groups proposed building twin towers though they were not identical to the original design by Minoru Yamasaki. After Daniel Libeskind's Memory Foundations design was favored and then chosen by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation in 2003, the proposed twin-towered designs were rejected. The result of the competition and the design chosen by the LMDC was criticized by the public, including architectural critic Herbert Muschamp as well as Donald Trump. The twin-towered Team Twin Towers design was planned to be entered into the World Trade Center Site Memorial Competition, but was unable to complete the design before the competition closed. == Initial emergence (2004) == The initial planning of the project first surfaced in the media in 2004 with the group behind the project called Team Twin Towers, Inc., composed of activists and designers collaborating on the early design of the model. The team was initially led by television producer and co- founder of the team Randy Warner, and the design led by engineer Kenneth \\"Ken\\" Gardner and architect Herbert Belton, who was an architect for the original World Trade Center. Their spokesman was Jonathan Hakala, a venture capitalist who had been a tenant on the 77th floor of the original North Tower. The project design was called the \\"Plan of the People\\", and would be identical to the original Yamasaki design. The new design would feature a steel skin built in two layers‚Äìa tube within a tube‚Äìthat has heavier columns and better structural support than the original, and it would call for larger windows for comfort and improved fireproofing. The memorial would feature two 5-story memorials that would occupy the original footprints of the Twin Towers, made of the original steel skin of the collapsed towers and replicated steel. The victims' names etched in granite. \\"It stands for resolve, it stands for strength, it stands for renewal\\", says engineer of the project Ken Gardner. \\"To see the towers return would have an inspirational impact on the population. It's a living memorial, and I think it's more powerful than pretending 9/11 never happened.\\" The main twin towers originally would feature a 500-foot-high mast on top of the North Tower, which would bring its total height to 1,888 feet, which at the time would have made it the tallest building in the world surpassing the 1,667-foot-high Taipei 101 in Taipei, Taiwan. The two towers were planned to be 112 stories tall. Team Twin Towers was one of several groups pressuring government and development officials to alter the reconstruction plans of the Daniel Libeskind master plan chosen by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. Joanna Rose, spokeswoman for the LMDC, which is coordinating reconstruction at the site, said the organization intended to go forward with its chosen plan. Randy Warner, co-founder of Team Twin Towers said: \\"As long as we haven't started digging a hole in the ground, there's room for discussion.\\" Team Twin Towers, on February 18, 2004, unveiled their architectural model of new twin towers at a news conference at the Marriott Financial Center Hotel (now New York Marriott Downtown) near the World Trade Center site. Team Twin Towers spokesman Jonathan Hakala says the original Twin Towers \\"were among Earth's few 'instantly recognizable' landmarks.\\" and \\"It was a magnificent structure to see going up\\", recalls Artie Vignapiano, who was a Port Authority landscape planner as the original World Trade Center was built. \\"When I worked on the 74th floor of Tower One, I used to tell people, 'You know what I get paid for? To look outside my window at the Statue of Liberty.'\\" He then went on to say, 'All of the people who worked on the buildings‚Äî10 out of 10‚Äîwant them back.'\\" Later in February businessman Donald Trump appeared on CNN show Larry King Live with Larry King. During a talk radio broadcast, a caller asked whether Trump was involved or going to be involved with the \\"new twin towers\\". Though Trump at the time was not involved with the Team Twin Towers project, he became a sponsor of the project's design in the later year(s). Trump said the following about the Childs-Libeskind design of One World Trade Center: == Early development (2005‚Äì2007) == Early design for the proposed complex, circa 2007. In 2005, publicity for the project increased, with businessman Donald Trump officially supporting and sponsoring the project. Support for the project increased due to the criticism of the Childs-Libeskind design and accusations from 2002 revived against former New York Governor George Pataki, accused of cronyism for supposedly using his influence to get the winning architect's design picked as a personal favor for his friend and campaign contributor, Ron Lauder. In May 2005, Trump appeared on Hardball with Chris Matthews to discuss the proposed Childs-Libeskind Freedom Tower design. While Matthews asks Trump about whether an empty site is better than the proposed design, he quickly responds, criticizing Daniel Libeskind, one of the building's lead architects, \\"It was designed by an egghead architect who really doesn't have a lot of experience of designing something like this. And it's just a terrible design.\\" Trump later goes on to say that he doesn't \\"even blame the architect.\\" Trump, who in the later month(s) later sponsors the project, says that there is \\"not much of a role I can take.\\" in response to a question by Matthews. \\"What I want to see built is the World Trade Center stronger and maybe a story taller. And that's what everybody wants.\\" While the project was gaining publicity due to Donald Trump's sponsorship of it, former Borough president of The Bronx, Fernando Ferrer, supported the plan to build new twin towers, saying that it is \\"very interesting and it should be considered.\\" adding that the new signature building shouldn't look \\"cowardly.\\" Before the statement, Ferrer issued a rebuilding plan that called to spread out the 10 million square feet of office space around the five boroughs so it \\"decentralized.\\" Ferrer spokeswoman Jen Bluestein said that \\"The reason, he said then, was to create back-office space to help the boroughs outside Manhattan. He also didn't want to give the terrorists another target.\\" she continued to explain, \\"Fernando Ferrer has always believed that the mayor's responsibility was to both rebuild critical mass at Ground Zero and, using existing hubs, expand office space throughout the five boroughs. Unfortunately, Mayor Bloomberg has managed to do neither\\". Greg Manning, who worked in the original World Trade Center along with his wife Lauren, wrote an article in The New York Times supporting the Twin Towers II project. Greg worked for Euro Brokers on the 84th floor of the South Tower and Lauren was a partner for Cantor Fitzgerald on the 105th floor of the North Tower. Manning was late, so he was not in his office when United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the building, destroying the Euro Brokers offices. His wife Lauren was burnt by the fireball that blew out the lobby of the North Tower after American Airlines Flight 11 hit the building. Greg said the following about the project: Trump, on May 18, 2005, held a press conference at his residence on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, to address the proposed Twin Towers II design. Along with him was engineer Ken Gardner and architect Herbert Belton, Trump presented the Team Twin Towers designed twin-towered complex model. The Freedom Tower plan, according to Trump, \\"looks like a junkyard, a series of broken-down angles that don't match each other. And we have to live with this for hundreds of years? It is the worst pile of crap architecture I've ever seen in my life.\\" Though Trump was supporting the proposed twin-towered project, he was leaving the decision up to Larry Silverstein, which his company Silverstein Properties was the lease holder of the site. \\"I only have the power of persuasion\\", Trump said. At the press conference, he read from a letter sent to him by Daniel Libeskind, whose plan was planned to be built. Trump quoted Libeskind as saying the shape of the tower was \\"the product of David Childs\\", while he wanted a more slender, classical tower set back farther from the street. Libeskind added in a statement Wednesday: \\"The site plan is not just about commercial buildings. The memorial is its crucial centerpiece. It is there for a reason.\\" Trump, finishing his speech, said that \\"If we rebuild the World Trade Center in the form of a skeleton, the terrorists win.\\" and that if tenants could not be found for the project, to build a memorial park instead. A final design for the \\"Freedom Tower\\" was formally unveiled on June 28, 2005. To address security issues raised by the New York City Police Department, a concrete base was added to the design in April of that year. The design originally included plans to clad the base in glass prisms in order to address criticism that the building might have looked uninviting and resembled a \\"concrete bunker\\".\\"Prismatic glass fa√ßade for WTC tower scrapped\\" . The Huffington Post. May 12, 2011. Retrieved June 19, 2011. Construction of the Freedom Tower began in April 2006, which jeopardized the Twin Towers II project from being built on the site. == Later development (2008‚Äì2009) == One World Trade Center, the main building of the rebuilt World Trade Center complex, in 2015. Criticism arose in 2008 that the rebuilding of the World Trade Center was taking longer than expected. Though now-renamed One World Trade Center (formerly Freedom Tower) was under construction as well as the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, it was still proposed to halt One World Trade Center and build the Twin Towers II project. \\"Seeing them go up could be as powerful as seeing them go down.\\" Ken Gardner stated, engineer of the project. Members of the Twin Towers Alliance, an organization supporting the rebuilding of new twin towers, gathered in July 2008 in Central Park to rally for the cause. Margaret Donovan, a graphic designer and organizer for the Twin Towers Alliance, criticized the city for allegedly \\"not paying attention to New Yorkers' wishes for redevelopment designs.\\" Donovan worked in the South Tower the year before the attacks. Though One World Trade Center was under construction, she stated that \\"We can still have the World Trade Center we deserve\\", adding that \\"It's not wishful thinking. It's just common sense, and it's not too late.\\" == Project abandonment (2010) == Since 2008, news of the project, as well as if it could still be built, had not been mentioned. Due to the completion of One World Trade Center and Four World Trade Center, as well as the National September 11 Memorial & Museum since then, it is unlikely that the project will ever be built at the World Trade Center site. Since the project had been considered moot, Ken Gardner, the engineer of the project, made a comment that he considered voting for Donald Trump, who is now the 45th President of the United States. Bjarke Ingels, who was selected as the architect for Two World Trade Center's new design, stated that he would have rebuilt the World Trade Center if it were up to him. He commented, stating that \\"They were such a big part of the identity of Manhattan. When you watch Tony Soprano drive out of the Holland Tunnel, he can see the towers in his rearview mirror. They looked very strong.\\" == Notes  References  External links == *Make New York New York Again ‚Äì original website for the project *Twin Towers II ‚Äì website with compiled renderings of the project design *Team Twin Towers archived website ‚Äì an archived version of the original team designing the project *The Twin Towers Alliance ‚Äì an organization who promoted the project Category:Unbuilt buildings and structures in the United States Category:Proposed skyscrapers in the United States Category:September 11 attacks Category:World Trade Center Category:Financial District, Manhattan Category:Skyscrapers in Manhattan Category:Proposed buildings and structures in New York City Category:Twin towers ","title":"Twin Towers 2"},{"id":"41968747","text":"The Asean Football Federation Player of the Year is an association football award presented to the best footballer in ASEAN region.

His research is focused on methods by which tumors are able to suppress the immune system and how to develop new immune therapies to combat this ability. Dr. Gabrilovich described the defective ability of dendritic cells in induce immune responses in cancer, and was one of the discoverers of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). The Gabrilovich lab focuses on immature myeloid cell biology and its relation to cancer. MDSC have been linked to a number of signaling pathways associated with cancer, including NF-Œ∫B, Jak-STAT, Notch, Wnt, and Rb, among others. His research has found that tumor cells can go through a mechanism that produces a free radical peroxynitrite, causing them to become resistant to certain types of cancer immunotherapy. His research has also focused on monocytic-myeloid derived suppressor cells and polymorphonuclear-myeloid derived suppressor cells and what impact they might have on cancer therapy, since myeloid derived suppressor cells negatively regulate anti-tumor activity.. His group described methods of targeting suppressive myeloid cell. In 2019 he was awarded title of Research Professor by American Cancer Society . Prior to joining AstraZeneca Dr. Gabrilovich was a researcher and Christopher M. Davis professor at The Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. Prior to joining The Wistar Institute, Gabrilovich was a senior member at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa. ==Select recent publications== * Ugolini A, Tyurin V, Tyurina Y, Tsyganov E, Donthireddy L, Kagan VE, Gabrilovich DI, Veglia F.

He was an atheist who believed in communism, and he wrote several articles on anarchism and communism for Kirti. He was arrested on 8 April 1929 in connection with the Central Legislative Assembly bombing case and was sentenced to 14 years life imprisonment. He was re-arrested in connection with the murder of one Saunders, a deputy superintendent of police who was killed by Sukhdev, Rajguru, and Bhagat Singh in 1928 in retaliation for the death of Lala Lajpat Rai. In that case, the trial began and he was transferred to Lahore jail. In the jail, on 4 October 1930, Baba Randhir Singh, a religious man and member of Ghadar Party who was convicted in the first Lahore conspiracy case, met Bhagat Singh and tried to incite his belief in God; however, Bhagat Singh did not change his stand. Thereafter, Randhir Singh said \\"You are giddy with fame and have developed an ego which is standing like a black curtain between you and the God\\". As a reply to Randhir Singh, he wrote this essay on 5 and 6 October 1930. On 7 October 1930, all three of the defendants were convicted in the murder of Saunders and sentenced to death. On 23 March 1931, they were executed by hanging in the Lahore jail (present-day Shadman Chowk or Bhagat Singh Chowk). == Publication == After the death of Singh, the essay was published on 27 September 1931 in Lala Lajpat Rai's English weekly The People. === Tamil version === On the request of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy, P. Jeevanandham translated the essay to the Tamil language. The Tamil version of the essay was published in Kudi Arasu in 1935. According to Chaman Lal, \\"at one time after Partition, the English copy of this essay was not found anywhere. It was then re-translated from Tamil to English, and some websites still carry the re-translated English version of this essay\\". == Contents == In the essay, Bhagat Singh states that his atheism was not a result of vanity. He mentions that his family were firm believers in God, that he himself grew up as a religious boy who would chant prayers for hours and goes on to explain how despite this he went on to become an atheist. He mentions that his atheism was also not a result of his association with a revolutionary organization and that most of his comrades were in fact theists, citing the example of Sachindra Nath Sanyal who was a firm believer in God. An excerpt from the essay reads: He also questioned theists about the existence of God. == References == Category:1930 essays Category:Atheism publications Category:Philosophy of religion literature Category:Contemporary philosophical literature Category:Memorials to Bhagat Singh ","title":"Why I Am an Atheist"},{"id":"41969029","text":"Miguel Pedro Mundo (July 25, 1937 ‚Äì May 18, 1999) was an American-born bishop of the Catholic Church in Brazil.

Originally included in the genus Syntarsus, it has been reclassified as Coelophysis along with the African species, Coelophysis rhodesiensis. The name C. kayentakatae refers to Dr. Kathleen Smith, nicknamed \\"Kayenta Kay\\" for her extensive work in the Kayenta Formation, which included the discovery of the type specimen of this species.Rowe, (1989). A new species of the theropod dinosaur Syntarsus from the Early Jurassic Kayenta Formation of Arizona. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. 9, 125-136. ==Description== Restoration of C. kayentakatae feeding on a Scutellosaurus C. kayentakatae had two small, parallel crests which may demonstrate an evolutionary step toward later and larger neotheropods, such as the more advanced and larger Dilophosaurus. Both possess a \\"weak joint\\" between the premaxillary and the maxillary bones, creating a hooked premaxillary jaw. Specimen UCMP V128659 was discovered in 1982 and referred to Syntarsus kayentakatae by Rowe in 1989 as a subadult gracile individual and Tykoski (2005)Tykoski, 1998. The osteology of Syntarsus kayentakatae and its implications for ceratosaurid phylogeny. Unpublished Masters Thesis, University of Texas at Austin, 217 pp. later agreed. Gay (2010) classified the specimen as tetanurine Kayentavenator elysiae.Gay, 2010. Notes on Early Mesozoic theropods. Lulu Press. 44 pp. Mortimer (2010) pointed out that there was no published evidence to support Kayentavenator being the same as kayentakatae except for in Ezcurra (2012) based on an unpublished analysis. According to Tykoski and Rowe (2004) Coelophysis kayentakatae can be distinguished based on the following characteristics: *the presence of nasal crests on the skull * the frontal bones on the skull are separated by a midline anterior extension of the parietal bones Furthermore, they list a transverse groove on the anterior astragalar surface, as an additional autapomorphy, however, it's also present in Coelophysis bauri and the Shake-n- Bake coelophysid (Tykoski, 2005). Tykoski, Ronald S. (2005). Anatomy, Ontogeny, and Phylogeny of Coelophysoid Theropods (PhD). University of Texas at Austin. Marsh and Rowe (2020) retain the generic name Syntarsus for both QG 1 and MNA V2623, and the respective specimens assigned to these taxa, as opposed to Coelophysis or Megapnosaurus, due to systematic relationships within Coelophysoidea in flux. As such, congenericity or the need for Megapnosaurus would not be supported if Coelophysis bauri, Syntarsus rhodesiensis, and Syntarsus kayentakatae do not form respective clades, as evidenced by their phylogenetic analyses. ==Ecology== The holotype of C. kayentakatae (MNA V2623) was recovered in the Silty Facies Member of the Kayenta Formation in Arizona. This material was collected in 1977 from carbonaceous sandstone deposited during the Sinemurian and Pliensbachian stages of the Jurassic period.Padian, K (1997) Glen Canyon Group In: Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs, edited by Currie, P. J., and Padian, K., Academic Press. The Kayenta Formation is part of the Glen Canyon Group that includes formations not only in northern Arizona but also parts of southeastern Utah, western Colorado, and northwestern New Mexico. The formation was primarily deposited by rivers, with the silty facies created by the slower, more sluggish part of the river system. A definitive radiometric dating of this formation has not yet been made, and the available stratigraphic correlation has been based on a combination of radiometric dates from vertebrate fossils, magnetostratigraphy and pollen evidence.J.

By the Middle Jurassic period it was being encroached upon from the north by a sandy dune field that would become the Navajo Sandstone. The animals here were adapted to a seasonal climate and abundant water could be found in streams, ponds and lakes.

The Kayenta Formation has produced the remains of three coelophysoid taxa of different body size, representing the most diverse ceratosaur fauna yet known.Tykoski, R. S., 1998, The Osteology of Syntarsus kayentakatae and its Implications for Ceratosaurid Phylogeny: Theses, The University of Texas, December 1998. The formation has also yielded a small but growing assemblage of organisms. Vertebrates present in the Kayenta Formation at the time of C. kayentakatae included hybodont sharks, indeterminate bony fish, lungfish, salamanders, the frog Prosalirus, the caecilian Eocaecilia, the turtle Kayentachelys, a sphenodontian reptile, various lizards, and the pterosaur Rhamphinion. Also present were the synapsids Dinnebitodon, Kayentatherium, Oligokyphus, morganucodontans, the possible early true mammal Dinnetherium, and a haramiyid mammal. Several early crocodylomorphs were also present, including Calsoyasuchus, Eopneumatosuchus, Kayentasuchus, and Protosuchus.Jenkins, F. A., Jr., Crompton, A. W., and Downs, W. R. 1983.

The plant life known from this area included trees that became preserved as petrified wood. ==Taphonomy== The holotype (MNA V2623) of C. kayentakatae came to rest on its left side and was partially buried. This served to stabilize the bones on the left side of the skull; however, the right side of the skull was likely exposed to water currents as it began to decompose. Some of the loosely connected bones on this side drifted out of place before the entire skull was finally buried. Later, the great weight of overlying sediment served to distort the specimen. ==References== Category:Coelophysoids Category:Early Jurassic dinosaurs of North America Category:Fossil taxa described in 1989 Category:Paleontology in Arizona Category:Kayenta Formation ","title":"Coelophysis kayentakatae"},{"id":"41969044","text":"Thomas Albion Alderson (13 November 1843 ‚Äì 5 February 1902) was an organist and composer based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. ==Life== He married Elizabeth Mary Eltringham (26 April 1843 - February 1912) on 24 June 1867 in Holy Trinity Church, South Shields.

The squadron's nickname from 1958-1994 was the Black Falcons. It was the second squadron to be designated VA-85, the first VA-85 was disestablished on 29 November 1949. ==History== * May 1958: As part of an Atlantic Fleet training exercise (LANTRAEX 1-58), two of the squadron's AD-6 Skyraiders, flown by Lieutenant (jg)s Strang and Woods, flew nonstop from , operating off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida, to Naval Air Station North Island. The flight was conducted below 1000 feet to demonstrate the low level and long range capability of the squadron. Two days later the aircraft returned, nonstop, to Forrestal. * 5 February 1963: The squadron's commanding officer, Commander C. H. Mundt, was killed in an air crash. * 22 December 1965: The squadron's commanding officer, Commander B. J. Cartwright, and his bombardier/navigator, Lieutenant Ed Gold, failed to return from a strike into North Vietnam and were listed as missing in action, presumed dead until their remains were identified in November 1994. * 21 April 1966: The squadron's commanding officer, Commander J. E. Keller, and his bombardier/navigator, Lieutenant Commander E. E. Austin, were killed in action during a mission over North Vietnam. * 27 April 1966: VA-85 bombardier/navigator, Lieutenant (jg) Brian E. Westin was awarded the Navy Cross for heroism during a combat mission over North Vietnam when he risked his own life to save that of his wounded pilot, Lieutenant W. R. Westerman. * 6 September 1968: The squadron's commanding officer, Commander K. L. Coskey, was shot down over North Vietnam. His bombardier/navigator, Lieutenant Commander R. G. McKee, was rescued, but Commander Coskey became a POW. He was released on 14 March 1973. * July 1974: Following the coup that overthrew the government of Cyprus, VA-85 operated from Forrestal in the vicinity of Cyprus and provided air cover for the evacuation of Americans and foreign nationals from the island. * May‚ÄìJune 1981: Following increased military action and Israeli reprisal raids against Syrian missile positions in southern Lebanon, Forrestal was ordered to the eastern Mediterranean. VA-85 operated from the carrier while on station off the coast of Lebanon. * July 1982: Following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June and the siege of west Beirut, Forrestal operated off the coast of Lebanon with VA-85 prepared to provide air support for a possible evacuation of Americans. * August‚ÄìSeptember 1982: Forrestal and its embarked squadrons provided air cover for the landing of 800 U.S. Marines in Beirut, Lebanon. The Marines became part of the Multinational Force in Lebanon. * 4 December 1983: During ‚Äôs operations off the coast of Lebanon in support of the Multinational Force, several of the carrier's F-14 reconnaissance aircraft received hostile fire from Syrian surface- to-air missile and anti-aircraft positions on 3 December. A retaliatory strike was flown by elements of CVW-3 and aircraft from against the Syrian antiaircraft positions near Hammana, Lebanon. One of the squadron's A-6Es was lost in the attack, its pilot, Lieutenant Mark Lange, was killed and the NFO, Lieutenant Bobby Goodman, was captured by the Syrians. He was released 4 January 1985. * July 1984: The squadron operated in the Caribbean and off the coast of Central America to assist the Coast Guard with drug interdiction operations. * 10 October 1985: The squadron's KA-6D tanker aircraft refueled F-14s from en route to their intercept of an Egyptian 737 airliner that was carrying Arab terrorists who had hijacked the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro on 7 October and murdered an American citizen. The F-14s forced the airliner to land at Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily, leading to the capture of the terrorists. * 24 March 1986: Libyan missiles were fired at U.S. Naval forces operating in the Gulf of Sidra. This action precipitated a retaliation against Libya by squadrons from Saratoga, and . VA-85's A-6Es conducted a follow-up attack with Rockeye bombs on a Libyan Combattante II G-class fast attack missile craft that had been hit by a Harpoon missile fired by a VA-34 aircraft. The attack resulted in the sinking of the Combattante II. VA-85 aircraft also attacked a Nanuchka II class missile corvette with Rockeyes, damaging the corvette. * 25 March 1986: VA-55 attacked a Nanuchka with Rockeyes, damaging but not stopping the corvette. A VA-85 aircraft then launched a Harpoon against the corvette which resulted in its sinking. * 6 September 1989: Squadron aircraft flew missions in support of the evacuation of personnel from the American Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, due to the unstable situation in that country. * 17 January‚Äì28 February 1991: The squadron participated in Operation Desert Storm, combat strikes against targets in Iraq and the Kuwaiti theater of operations.

It shows wheat as the symbol of agriculture, a rising sun for the future of the Russian nation, the red star (the RSFSR was the last Soviet Republic to include the star in its state emblem, in 1978) as well as the hammer and sickle for the victory of Communism and the \\"world-wide socialist community of states\\". The Soviet Union state motto (\\"Workers of the world, unite!\\") in Russian (–ü—Ä–æ–ª–µ—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–∏ –≤—Å–µ—Ö —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω, —Å–æ–µ–¥–∏–Ω—è–π—Ç–µ—Å—å! ‚Äî Proletarii vsekh stran, soyedinyaytes‚Ä≤!) is also a part of the coat of arms. The acronym of the RSFSR is shown above the hammer and sickle, and reads PC–§CP, for –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∞—è –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∞—è –°–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞ (Russian: Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic). Similar emblems were used by the Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republics (ASSR) within the Russian SFSR; the main differences were generally the use of the republic's acronym and the presence of the motto in the languages of the titular nations (with the exception of the state emblem of the Dagestan ASSR, which had the motto in eleven languages as there is no single Dagestani language). In 1992, the inscription was changed from RSFSR (–†–°–§–°–†) to the Russian Federation (–†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∞—è –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è) in connection with the change of the name of the state.The law of the Russian Federation from April 21, 1992 ‚Ññ 2708-I ¬´About changes and additions of the Constitution (Basic law) of the Russian SFSR¬ª In 1993, the Communist design was replaced by the present coat of arms. == History  First version === On January 24, 1918, the Secretary of the Council of People's Commissars, N.P. Gorbunov, appealed to the All-Russia Union of Masters and Technicians of factory enterprises with a request to provide a sample of a new seal of the Russian SFSR for discussion by the government. By the beginning of March 1918, a print drawing was ready, and a sword was depicted in its center. The authorship of the press is attributed to the artist Alexander Nikolaevich Leo (for certain this fact is not known). On April 17, 1918, at the meeting of the Council of People's Commissars, the question of the stamp seal was discussed, the Department of Affairs of the Council of People's Commissars was asked to create a Regulation on the procedure for its use. On April 20, N.P. Gorbunov addressed the commission of the Small Council of People's Commissars with a report on the progress of printing. A print project was approved (with a sword), but the drawing still had to be approved by the Big SNK. Before putting the question to the final statement, Lenin suggested adding the word \\"socialist\\" to the press and removing the sword from the press, which was already done at the evening session on April 20. On May 15, at the meeting of the Small Council of People's Commissars, a drawing of the press was signed with the inscription: \\"Workers 'and Peasants' Government of the Russian Socialist Federative Republic,\\" but again the desire was expressed to put a sword on print. After Lenin's speeches, the Small Council of People's Commissars decided to \\"throw out a sword from the drawing.\\" On June 18, 1918, at the meeting of the Council of People's Commissars, Y. Sverdlov's report \\"On the Soviet Press\\" was heard, the print project was approved in general, and the details (the question of the sword and the exact text of the inscription) were clarified the next day, June 19. Thus, the seal had the following appearance: in the center on a shield-cartouche framed with grain ears, a crossed sickle and a hammer; below in the vignette text: \\"–ü–†–û–õ–ï–¢–ê–†–ò–ò –í–°–ï–• –°–¢–†–ê–ù, –°–û–ï–î–ò–ù–Ø–ô–¢–ï–°–¨ !\\" (instead of the \\"Council of People's Commissars\\" in the first draft), and on the circumference: \\"–†–û–°–°–ò–ô–°–ö–ê–Ø –°–û–¶–ò–ê–õ–ò–°–¢–ò–ß–ï–°–ö–ê–Ø –§–ï–î–ï–†–ê–¢–ò–í–ù–ê–Ø –°–û–í–ï–¢–°–ö–ê–Ø –†–ï–°–ü–£–ë–õ–ò–ö–ê\\" (instead of \\"Workers and Peasants .....\\"). Artist DV Emelyanov June 20, 1918 began to make a copper seal. The impression of the first press of the SNK was given by VI Lenin in a letter to Clara Zetkin.  Approval  July 10, 1918 at the closing session of the 5th All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers', Peasants', Soldiers' and Cossack deputies adopted the Constitution of the RSFSR, which formally approved the arms of the republic: \\"Chapter XVII, Section 6, ¬ß 89. The emblem of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic consists of images on a red background in the sun's rays of a gold sickle and hammer, placed criss- crosswise with handles downwards, surrounded by a wreath of ears and with the inscription: a) The Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic b) Workers of all countries, unite! \\". The coat of arms is identical to the seal which was adopted on June 19. The only difference were in the presence of sun rays and in the precise indication of colors. The coat of arms for the first edition of the Constitution was created by the artist from Petrograd minting, A.F. Vasyutinsky.  Other versions  * In parallel with the Department of Affairs of the Council of People's Commissars, the People's Commissariat for Education dealt with the development of the press. The Arts Department of the People's Commissariat for Education in May 1918 organized a competition to develop the emblem of the Russian Republic. According to the terms of the competition, s figure of a worker and a peasant, the text \\"–†–°–§–°–†\\", the tools of labor, the slogan \\"Workers of all countries, unite!\\" should be represented in the arms. According to the results of the contest, the best projects were the projects of Miturich, Altman, and S.V. Chekhonin. * On the cover of the first edition of the Constitution of the Russian SFSR, another emblem for the RSFSR was painted by the artist E. Lansere. On the figureboard there was a sickle and a hammer in the rays of the sun, around them a wreath tied with a gold ribbon, on the intercepts of which were written the red letters \\"RSFSR\\"; above the hammer and sickle the motto; behind the shield two lictor beams (a symbol of power); in the lower part of the branch of oak. === Second version === In early 1920, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee decided to improve the artistic form of the press (and the coat of arms). July 20, 1920 was approved by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, a new version of the coat of arms, designed by the artist N.A. Andreev. The motto was now placed on the red ribbon in the lower part of the coat of arms, the name of the republic was given in abbreviated form \\"RSFSR\\" and was in the upper part of the shield, on each side of the shield-cartouche surrounded by 7 ears. The image of the abbreviation \\"RSFSR\\" instead of the full name \\"Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic\\" was established by the new Constitution of the RSFSR adopted on May 11, 1925 by the XII All-Russian Congress of Soviets, article 87 of which read: \\"87. The State Emblem of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic consists of an image on a red background in the sunlight of a golden sickle and hammer, placed cross-on-the-cross, handles down, surrounded by a wreath of ears, with the inscription: a) RSFSR.R. and b) Workers of all countries, unite! \\" On December 30, 1922, the RSFSR, the Ukrainian SSR, the Byelorussian SSR and the Transcaucasian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Under Stalin's Constitution, adopted on January 21, 1937, the coat of arms remained unchanged, but the abbreviation of the RSFSR was now deciphered differently: the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. In the Constitution of 1937 the coat of arms was described as follows: \\"Article 148. The State Emblem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic consists of an image of a gold sickle and a hammer, placed cross on a cross, with handles down, on a red background in the sun and framed with ears, with the inscription:\\" RSF.S. R. \\"and\\" Workers of all countries, unite! \\"  First revision  In accordance with the \\"Rules of Russian spelling and punctuation\\" approved in 1956, abbreviations in the Russian language began to be written without dividing points, which was reflected in the description of the emblem in the Constitution of the RSFSR and in the practice of depicting the State Emblem of the RSFSR.  Second revision  On April 12, 1978, the extraordinary seventh session of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of the ninth convocation adopted a new (so-called \\"Brezhnev\\") Constitution (Basic Law) of the RSFSR, the five-pointed star was added to the description of the emblem: > Article 180. The State Emblem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist > Republic is an image of a sickle and a hammer on a red background in the sun > and framed with ears of wheat with the inscription: \\"RSFSR\\" and > \\"Proletarians of all countries, unite!\\" At the top of the emblem is a five- > pointed star. Officially, the drawing of the new coat of arms with the star was established by a new edition of the Regulations on the State Emblem of the RSFSR, approved by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of January 22, 1981, which specified that \\"in the color image of the State Emblem of the RSFSR, the sickle and the golden hammer, the red star, border \\". At the same time, on the color image of the emblem attached to the Regulations, the inscriptions \\"RSFSR\\" and \\"Proletarians of all countries, unite!\\" were depicted in a dark brown color. == Gallery == Emblem_of_the_Russian_SFSR_(1918-1920).svg1918‚Äì20: Emblem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Coat of arms of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1920-1956).svg1920‚Äì56: Coat of arms of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Coat of arms of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1956-1978).svg1956‚Äì78: Coat of arms of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Coat of arms of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.svg1978‚Äì92: Coat of arms of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Coat of arms of the Russian Federation (1992-1993).svg1992‚Äì93: Coat of arms of post-Soviet Russia ==See also== *State Emblem of the Soviet Union *Emblems of the Soviet Republics *Coat of arms of Russia ==References== Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Category:Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Russian SFSR Russian SFSR Russian SFSR Russian SFSR Russian SFSR Russian SFSR Russian SFSR Russian SFSR Russian SFSR ","title":"Emblem of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic"},{"id":"41969112","text":"Rebekah 'Bex' Wilson (born 17 March 1991) is a British former bobsleigh brakewoman. She competed at the trials for the 2010 Winter Olympics, and the two-woman bobsleigh at the 2014 Winter Olympics. == Biography == Wilson was born on 17 March 1991 in Manchester, England. She attended Navigation Road Primary School and Wellington School. When Wilson was 9 years old, she took up athletics, after trialling several events including the 100m. She was a member of Altrincham Athletics Club. At 14, Wilson changed clubs, moving to her present club of Sale Harriers. At 100 metres, she won five national titles, was a World Junior finalist at the 4 √ó 100 m relay. At 12 Wilson set a European Record for the 60m, which stands at present. Wilson was the Great British number one from the age of 18, but each year has to participate in a selection process. In 2010 Paula Walker approached Wilson's athletics coaches with regards to competing alongside Walker in the two-women bobsleigh. Wilson quit the national programme and UK Sport funding, and moved from the Great Britain bobsleigh headquarters in Bath back to her native Manchester, cutting her communications with British Bobsleigh for a year. In the year leading up to the Olympics, she didn't practice at bobsleigh, but worked in a gym. In order to pay for training, Wilson took on odd jobs, such as babysitting, waitressing, and working as a nail technician. A year after Wilson's not competing at Vancouver, Walker and Wilson won a World Junior Championship together, re-uniting after Wilson's topping the GB trials. After the 2014 Winter Olympics Wilson retired from bobsleigh due to mental health problems and the retirement of Walker, subsequently undergoing intermittent treatment at the Priory Hospital for the next 18 months. As of July 2017, Wilson is a programme manager for the Diane Modahl Foundation, and plays for Women's Super Rugby side Waterloo Ladies. === Olympics === Wilson trialled for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, but finished fifth and was not selected. Wilson and Walker were announced as GBR1 for the two-women bobsleigh at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Wilson replaced Walker's partner for the previous season Gillian Cooke. Walker and Wilson targeted a top-eight finish in the discipline, in order to preserve funding for Walker. They competed on 18 February 2014, finishing in 12th. == References == Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:British female bobsledders Category:Sportspeople from Manchester Category:Olympic bobsledders of Great Britain Category:Bobsledders at the 2014 Winter Olympics Category:English female rugby union players Category:English female bobsledders ","title":"Rebekah Wilson"},{"id":"41969121","text":"Parmanpur is a place in Mirzapur district, near Kollapur, in Uttar Pradesh state in northern India.

Will he realize his dream or will his misplaced sense of self get in the way of it?), Adi(Successful film-director Adi, who's separated from his wife thanks to his philandering ways, is desperate to redeem himself and get her back.

Though the film follows the 500-Rupee note, it actually focuses on the 5 key characters whose lives are entirely and contrastingly different from each other in the way they look at money. ==Cast== * Deepak Sundararajan as Sudalai * Shankar as Adi * Living Smile Vidya as Sundari * Chinnu Kuruvilla as Jenny * T. M.

But still, money was a big hurdle to get their scripts produced. That's when during and after several discussions about \\"Money\\", the team decided to make their film about money (a 500 Rupee note) and perceptions about it. Once the core concept \\"the journey of a 500-Rupee note\\" was decided, Director Raghu wrote the screenplay in 15 days at a single stretch. Some of the characters of the film are loosely inspired from real life like the \\"Money-less revolutionary\\" character played by TM Karthik Srinivasan, was inspired from people like Mark Boyle, Heidemarie Schwermer, Daniel Suelo among others. The Casting of the film took 2 months with intense audition sessions held in Chennai except for one character \\"Jenny\\" which took almost 4 months because of the extreme nature of the character. Several of the key cast members hail from a theater background with performances in Tamil, English and Malayalam. The entire shooting schedule took about 21 days split over 3 to 4 schedules. A one-minute trailer drew attention as soon as a promo was released on YouTube. A 5K marathon run was conducted to promote the concept of a world without money and around 150 people participated in that marathon. ==Soundtrack== The songs have been written and composed by S. Ramanujam and S. Balaji. ==ReleaseCritical reception== The film was officially selected at the International Film Festival of Kerala, Trivandrum in 2012 and at the Filmburo Baden-Wurttemberg‚Äôs Stuttgart Indian Film Festival, Germany in 2013. ==Release== The film was released unconventionally on the internet on the YouTube Channel of Accessible Horizon Films on 1 May 2016. Before the release, the makers had one special public screening at the Alliance Francaise, Madras on 29 April 2016. The producer stated that for three years, the Accessible Horizon Films team had been trying to release their film conventionally in theaters in Tamil Nadu, searching for distributors and trying to find people who might take their film and release it in theaters. The difficulty of releasing a film conventionally without financial backing or influence is just unimaginable especially when the film doesn‚Äôt conform to the norms or the ‚Äòformula‚Äô. They initially thought of going conventionally only to reach a wide audience, because the film is about money, which everyone can relate to.http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/ayynoorum-ayynthum-is-being- released-online-for-free/article8541431.ece ==ReferencesCategory:2016 films Category:Indian films Category:Tamil-language films Category:Indian independent films Category:2010s Tamil-language films ","title":"Ayynoorum Ayynthum"},{"id":"41969233","text":"Life Story is a British natural-history television series with Mike Gunton, Rupert Barrington and Tom Hugh-Jones from the BBC Natural History Unit on the production team.

It was built in 1842 on the ruins of the \\"Belles Truches\\" castle, built in 1376 (1). This building once destroyed left the place to a hotel built by Philippe Franel and inaugurated on May 3, 1842 (3) under the name \\"H√¥tel Monnet\\" (3), the name of its owner back then. Gabriel Monnet named it \\"Trois Couronnes\\" because he owned an inn of the same name, also situated on Vevey's Rue du Simplon (4). Originally built with a direct access to Lake Geneva, the building lost it in 1863 with the construction of the lakeside promenade. In 1890, several transformations occurred: two annexes were added to the main building, as well as a ballroom in the west wing and a new residential area in the east wing (5). The building is registered as a cultural property of national value (6). It was entirely renovated in 2000 and since 2003 is a Swiss historical hotel (7). Among the many celebrities who stayed at the hotel, three crowned heads allowed the hotel property to justify its name: Queen Olga of Greece, the Maharajah Holkar of Indore and King William III of the Netherlands (8). Inspired by the hotel's intrigue, the writer Henry James wrote his short story Daisy Miller. == Bibliography == * F√©dia Muller, Vevey et l'H√¥tel des trois couronnes, 1958 == References == #Fr√©d√©ric Jean Charles de Gingins-La-Sarra, Histoire de la ville de Vevey et de son avouerie: depuis son origine jusqu'au XIV√®me si√®cle ; suivie d'une Notice sur la baronnie du Ch√¢telard et de Montreux ; des tables g√©n√©alogiques des sires de la Maison d'Oron et d'un plan de Vevey au Moyen √¢ge, 1863, p. 43-44 #Dave L√ºthi, Eug√®ne Jost: architecte du pass√© retrouv√©, PPUR presses polytechniques, coll. ¬´ Les Archives de la construction moderne ¬ª, 2001 (), p. 43 #John Coindet, Vevey et ses environs: avec deux panoramas indicateurs du lac et des montagnes, F.

The group's nickname originated when New York City area residents began traveling to early Notre Dame football games around the New York area by train. The largely Irish and Catholic population began to rally around the emerging Midwestern school.Cavanaugh, Jack (2010). The Gipper: George Gipp, Knute Rockne, and the Dramatic Rise of Notre Dame Football. New York: Skyhorse Publishing In 1991, Notre Dame on NBC continued to increase and grow the size of the Subway Alumni when every Notre Dame football home game was televised nationally. For the last nine decades, the Subway Alumni has grown through generation after generation. Although born in the New York City area, the group quickly spread to Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago and the rest of the country. In Italy, where a Notre Dame Club was founded in 1944, 'subway alumni' are known as 'catacomb alumni'. ==History== In 1913, led by Coach Jesse Harper, Notre Dame football set out to expand past their mid-western roots and scheduled games with national powerhouses Texas, Penn State and Army. On November 1, 1913, led by quarterback Charles ‚ÄúGus‚Äù Dorais and end Knute Rockne Notre Dame stunned the Black Knights on the Hudson, by a final score of 35-13 at West Point. In 1918, Knute Rockne was named Head Coach of Notre Dame, then known as the Ramblers. During his 13 seasons, Rockne would become a legendary figure in Notre Dame history, winning three National Championships and finishing with an overall 105-12-5 record. By the 1919 game at West Point, there was a crowd of more than 5,000, which included hundreds ‚Äì 700, according to the Notre Dame Scholastic, the weekly student publication ‚Äì of Notre Dame supporters, many of them former players, alumni, and current students, including spectators from the New York area who would ultimately become the core of what would be called Notre Dame's ‚ÄúSubway Alumni‚Äù and whose ranks would eventually spread throughout the country. In the 1920s, Notre Dame alumnus Francis Wallace popularized the often used nickname of ‚ÄúFighting Irish‚Äù when referring to the team in his New York Daily News columns. In 1927, University President Rev. Matthew Walsh, C.S.C., officially adopted ‚ÄúFighting Irish‚Äù as the Notre Dame nickname. The victory over Army not only focused more attention on Notre Dame but boosted the spirits of tens of thousands of Irish Catholics throughout the country ‚Äì many of whom had never set foot on a college campus but had become enamored of a team and a university with which they now had a common bond. These newfound followers of Notre Dame football would come to be known as the school's ‚ÄúSubway Alumni.‚Äù Perhaps the most notable aspect of the 1921 season was Notre Dame playing three games within the span of eight days. After beating Army on Saturday, November 5, the team remained in the New York area, staying and practicing at the Bear Mountain Inn near West Point, and then made its New York City debut the following Tuesday, Election Day, by routing Rutgers, 48-0, before a crowd of less than 12,000 at the Polo Grounds, home of baseball's New York Giants and New York Yankees. Despite the short period of time between the games, Rockne had accepted an offer from Rutgers ‚Äì who Notre Dame had never played ‚Äì to play at the Polo Grounds because it would attract the attention of New York's dozen newspapers and Notre Dame alumni in the metropolitan area, along with hopefully adding to its growing ‚ÄúSubway Alumni‚Äù who had no connection with the school. In 1923, having outgrown Cullum Field at West Point, Notre Dame and Army decided to move their rivalry to New York. The first game was played before a near-capacity crowd of around 35,000 at Ebbets Field http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1133026/index.htm in Brooklyn, then home to the Brooklyn Robins of the National League, later known as the Dodgers. The second game, played in Manhattan on October 18, 1924, at the Polo Grounds, home of the New York Giants baseball team, attracted a larger crowd, a capacity gathering of 55,000. An even bigger crowd of about 65,000 turned out for the third New York City game, and the first at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. Those large crowds, which mainly seemed to be made up of Notre Dame supporters ‚Äì perhaps because of the city's large Irish population ‚Äì were an indication that the school's ‚ÄúSubway Alumni‚Äù was continuing to grow. In the early days of Notre Dame football becoming a national powerhouse, the Subway Alumni received its name because so many of them were from New York City and traveled by subway to and from Army-Notre Dame games throughout the New York City area. In years to come, the Subway Alumni would expand throughout Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston and cities all over the country and abroad. ==Alumni Associations== The University of Notre Dame Alumni Association has clubs in other cities elsewhere in the world. However, these clubs are not exclusive to only those who have graduated from the university. The Subway Alumni make up a portion of the membership in many of these clubs. The Gettysburg, Pennsylvania club is made up of ninety two percent (92%) Subway Alumni. ==Celebrity Subway Alumni== Jon Bon Jovi Vince Vaughn George Wendt Martin Sheen Jim Caviezel David Robinson Danny Boy O'Connor ==References== Category:Notre Dame Fighting Irish football Category:University of Notre Dame people ","title":"Subway Alumni"},{"id":"41969311","text":"G√°bor Palotai is a Swedish‚ÄìHungarian designer, artist, graphic designer and typographer.

Regan was a Francis Hill Professor of Local Government at the University of Nottingham and a member of the Bruges Group that rejected the idea of a 'federal' European Union. ==Death== Regan died by suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning on the university park campus of the University of Nottingham. Regan cited his treatment at Nottingham in a suicide note. A Service of Thanksgiving for his life was held at the Church of St Mary the Virgin, High Pavement, Nottingham on 22 October 1994. The church was full to overflowing. Tributes were paid by the Reverend Tom Irvine, The Rt. Honourable Baroness Blatch; County Councillor John Hayes, Sir Harry Djanogly, Professor Dennis Kavanagh and Rebecca Regan. What, perhaps, only became apparent after his death were quite how enormous and far reaching were his contributions to the spread of pluralist democracy and opposition to totalitarianism in every form, particularly in Eastern Europe. Equally, the fact that he quietly inspired generations of his students with his deeply held beliefs. ==References== Category:British political scientists Category:Suicides by carbon monoxide poisoning Category:1939 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Academics of the University of Nottingham ","title":"David Regan"},{"id":"41969331","text":"Two Japanese destroyers have been named Suzunami: * , a of the Imperial Japanese Navy * , a of the JMSDF Category:Japanese Navy ship names ","title":"Japanese destroyer Suzunami"},{"id":"41969333","text":"Chemogenetics is the process by which macromolecules can be engineered to interact with previously unrecognized small molecules. Chemogenetics as a term was originally coined to describe the observed effects of mutations on chalcone isomerase activity on substrate specificities in the flowers of Dianthus caryophyllus. This method is very similar to optogenetics; however, it uses chemically engineered molecules and ligands instead of light and light-sensitive channels known as opsins. In recent research projects, chemogenetics has been widely used to understand the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Prior to chemogenetics, researchers used methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation to study the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior. == Comparison to optogenetics == Optogenetics and chemogenetics are the more recent and popular methods used to study this relationship. Both of these methods target specific brain circuits and cell population to influence cell activity. However, they use different procedures to accomplish this task. Optogenetics uses light- sensitive channels and pumps that are virally introduced into neurons. Cells' activity, having these channels, can then be manipulated by light. Chemogenetics, on the other hand, uses chemically engineered receptors and exogenous molecules specific for those receptors, to affect the activity of those cells. The engineered macromolecules used to design these receptors include nucleic acid hybrids, kinases, variety of metabolic enzymes, and G-protein coupled receptors such as DREADDs. DREADDs are the most common G protein‚Äìcoupled receptors used in chemogenetics. These receptors solely get activated by the drug of interest (inert molecule) and influence physiological and neural processes that take place within and outside of the central nervous system. Chemogenetics has recently been favored over optogenetics, and it avoids some of the challenges of optogenetics. Chemogenetics does not require the expensive light equipment, and therefore, is more accessible. The resolution in Optogenetic declines due to light scattering and illuminance declined levels as the distance between the subject and the light source increases. These factors, therefore, don‚Äôt allow for all cells to be affected by light and lead to a lower spatial resolution. Chemogenetics, however, does not require light usage and therefore can achieve a higher spatial resolution. ==Applications== G-protein coupled receptors' usage and chemogenetics are nowadays the targets for many of the pharmaceutical companies to cure and alleviate symptoms of diseases that involve all tissues of the body. More specifically, DREADDs have been used to explore treatment options for various neurodegenerative and psychological conditions such as Parkinson‚Äôs disease, depression, anxiety, and addiction. These aforementioned conditions involve processes that occur within and outside of the nervous system involving neurotransmitters such as gamma-aminobutyric acid and glutamate. Chemogenetics has therefore been used in pharmacology to adjust the levels of such neurotransmitters in specific neuron while minimizing the side effects of treatment. To treat and relieve the symptoms of any disease using the DREADDs, these receptors are delivered to the area of interest via viral transduction. Recently some studies have considered using a new method called retro DREADDs. This method allows specific neuronal pathways to be studied under cellular resolution. Unlike classic DREADDs, this method is usually used in wild type animals, and these receptors are given to the targeted cells via injection of two viral vectors. === Animal Models === DREADDS have been used in many animal models (e.g., mice and other non-primate animals) to target and influence the activity of various cells . Chemogenetics used in animals assists with demonstrating human disease models such as Parkinson's disease. Having this information allows scientists understand whether viral expression of DREADD proteins, both in-vivo enhancers and inhibitors of neuronal function can be used to bidirectionally affect the behaviors and the activity of the involved neurons. Recent studies have shown that DREADDs were successfully used to treat the motor deficits of rats modeling Parkinson's disease. Other studies have had successes linking the usage of DREADDs and influencing drug seeking and drug sensitization behavior. The progression of chemogenetics from rodents to non-human primates has been slow due to increased demand in time and expense surrounding these projects. However, some recent studies in 2016 have been able to demonstrate successes showing that silencing the activity of neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex along with the removal of rhinal cortex, restricted the reward task performance in macaques. == Limitation and future directions == Chemogenetics and usage of DREADDs have allowed researchers to advance in biomedical research areas including many neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions. Chemogenetics have been used in these fields to induce specific and reversible brain lesions and therefore, study specific activities of neuron population. Although chemogenetics offers specificity and high spatial resolution, it still faces some challenges when used in investigating neuropsychiatric disorders. Neuropsychiatric disorders usually have a complex nature where lesions in the brain have not been identified as the main cause. Chemogenetics has been used to reverse some of the deficits revolving such conditions; however, it has not been able to identify the main cause of neuropsychiatric diseases and cure these conditions completely due to complex nature of these conditions. Nevertheless, chemogenetics has been used successfully in a preclinical model of drug-resistant epilepsy, where seizures arise from a discrete part of the brain. == References == Category:Chemical engineering ","title":"Chemogenetics"},{"id":"41969347","text":"Seaborn Networks is a developer, owner, and operator of submarine communications cables.

ATDD encompasses many of the same practices as specification by example (SBE),Adzic, Gojko. (2009) Bridging the Communication Gap: Specification by Example and Agile Acceptance Testing, Neuri Limited, behavior-driven development (BDD),Chelimsky, David, Dave Astels, Zach Dennis, Aslak Helles√∏y, Bryan Helmkamp, and Dan North. The RSpec Book: Behaviour Driven Development with RSpec, Cucumber, and Friends. The Pragmatic Bookshelf. example-driven development (EDD), and support-driven development also called story test‚Äìdriven development (SDD). All these processes aid developers and testers in understanding the customer's needs prior to implementation and allow customers to be able to converse in their own domain language. ATDD is closely related to test-driven development (TDD).Beck, Kent. Test Driven Development: By Example. Addison-Wesley Professional, 2002. It differs by the emphasis on developer-tester-business customer collaboration. ATDD encompasses acceptance testing, but highlights writing acceptance tests before developers begin coding. == Overview == Acceptance tests are from the user's point of view ‚Äì the external view of the system. They examine externally visible effects, such as specifying the correct output of a system given a particular input. Acceptance tests can verify how the state of something changes, such as an order that goes from \\"paid\\" to \\"shipped\\". They also can check the interactions with interfaces of other systems, such as shared databases or web services. In general, they are implementation independent, although automation of them may not be.Melnik, Grigori, and Frank Maurer. Koskela, Lasse. (2007) Test Driven: TDD and Acceptance TDD for Java Developers. Manning Publications === Creation === Acceptance tests are created when the requirements are analyzed and prior to coding. They can be developed collaboratively by requirement requester (product owner, business analyst, customer representative, etc.), developer, and tester. Developers implement the system using the acceptance tests. Failing tests provide quick feedback that the requirements are not being met. The tests are specified in business domain terms. The terms then form a ubiquitous language that is shared between the customers, developers, and testers.Evans, Eric. (2003) Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software. Addison-Wesley Professional. Tests and requirements are interrelated. A requirement that lacks a test may not be implemented properly. A test that does not refer to a requirement is an unneeded test. An acceptance test that is developed after implementation begins represents a new requirement.Martin, Robert C., and Grigori Melnik. === Testing strategy === Acceptance tests are a part of an overall testing strategy. They are the customer tests that demonstrate the business intent of a system. Component tests are technical acceptance tests developed by an architect that specify the behavior of large modules. Unit tests are created by the developer to drive easy-to-maintain code.[Test-driven_development] They are often derived from acceptance tests and unit tests. Cross-functional testing includes usability testing,Meszaros, Gerard, and Janice Aston. (2006) \\"Adding Usability Testing to an Agile Project.\\" Agile Conference exploratory testing, and property testing (scaling and security).Meszaros, Gerard.(2007) xUnit Test Patterns: Refactoring Test Code. Addison-Wesley. == Acceptance criteria and tests == Acceptance criteria are a description of what would be checked by a test. Given a requirement such as \\"As a user, I want to check out a book from the library\\", an acceptance criterion might be, \\"verify the book is marked as checked out\\". An acceptance test for this requirement gives the details so that the test can be run with the same effect each time. === Test format === Acceptance tests usually follow this form: Given (setup) : A specified state of a system When (trigger) : An action or event occurs Then (verification) : The state of the system has changed or an output has been produced Also, it is possible to add Statements that start with AND in any of the sections below (Given, When, Then). For the example requirement, the steps could be listed as: Given Book that has not been checked out And User who is registered on the system When User checks out a book Then Book is marked as checked out === Complete test === The previous steps do not include any specific example data, so that is added to complete the test: Given: : Book that has not been checked out {  - ! Books  -  Title  Checked out -  Great book  No } : User who is registered on the system {  - ! Users -  Name  Sam } When: : User checks out a book {  - ! Checkout action -  User  Sam  Checks out  Great book } Then: : Book is marked as checked out {  - ! Books -  Title  Checked out  User -  Great book  Yes  Sam } === Test examination === Examination of the test with specific data usually leads to many questions. For the sample, these might be: * What if the book is already checked out? * What if the book does not exist? * What if the user is not registered on the system? * Is there a date that the book is due to be checked-in? * How many books can a user check out? These questions help illuminate missing or ambiguous requirements. Additional details such as a due-date can be added to the expected result. Other acceptance tests can check that conditions such as attempting to check out a book that is already checked out produces the expected error. === Another test example === Suppose the business customer wanted a business rule that a user could only check out one book at a time. The following test would demonstrate that: Scenario: Check that checkout business rule is enforced Given: : Book that has been checked out {  - ! Books -  Title  Checked out  User -  Great book  Yes  Sam -  Another great book  No } {  - ! Users -  Name -  Sam } When: : User checks out another book {  - ! Checkout action -  User  Sam  Checks out  Another great book } Then: : Error occurs {  - ! Error occurred -  Description -  Violation of checkout business rule } === Project acceptance tests === In addition to acceptance tests for requirements, acceptance tests can be used on a project as a whole. For example, if this requirement was part of a library book checkout project, there could be acceptance tests for the whole project. These are often termed SMART objectives.

It lives in Somalia, southern Ethiopia, and northern Kenya.\\"Rare white giraffes spotted in Kenya conservation area\\". Naaman Zhou, The Guardian, 14 September 2017. Accessed 14 September 2017. There are approximately 8,500 individuals living in the wild. The reticulated giraffe was described and given its binomial name by British zoologist William Edward de Winton in 1899, however the IUCN currently recognizes only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies. Reticulated giraffes can interbreed with other giraffe species in captivity or if they come into contact with populations of other species in the wild. Together with the Rothschild's giraffe, it is by far the giraffe that is most commonly seen in zoos.ISIS (2010). Giraffa. Version 1 October 2010 Its coat consists of large, polygonal, liver-colored spots outlined by a network of bright-white lines. The blocks may sometimes appear deep red and may also cover the legs. Giraffes are the tallest mammals in the world. ==Taxonomy== The IUCN currently recognizes only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies, one of which is the reticulated giraffe. All living giraffes were originally classified as one species by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The subspecies was described and given a binomial name Giraffa reticulata by British zoologist William Edward de Winton in 1899. ==Distribution and habitat== Reticulated giraffes historically occurred widely throughout Northeast Africa. Their favored habitats are savannas, woodlands, seasonal floodplains, and rainforests. Reticulated giraffes at Samburu National Reserve, Kenya ==Conservation== To save the remaining 9,000, or so, Reticulated giraffes, several conservation organizations have been formed. One of these organizations is San Diego Zoo Global's \\"Twiga Walinzi\\" (meaning Giraffe Guards) initiative. Their work includes hiring and training local Kenyans to monitor 120 trail cameras in Northern Kenya (Loisaba Conservancy and Namunyak Wildlife Conservancy) that capture footage of wild giraffes and other Kenyan wildlife; developing a photo ID database so individual giraffes can be tracked; informing rangers of poaching incidents and removing snares; caring for orphaned giraffes; and educating communities about giraffe conservation. ==In zoos== Along with the Rothschild's giraffe, the reticulated giraffe is the most common giraffe found in zoos. The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs, Colorado is said to have the largest reticulated giraffe herd in all of North America. Reticulated and Rothschild's giraffes have been bred together in the past. This was done because it was thought that the giraffe subspecies interbred in the wild. However, new research that was done in 2016 discovered that the separate giraffe populations do not interbreed. Few zoos have distinct Rothschild's giraffe or reticulated giraffe herds. The San Diego Zoo Safari Park, Bronx Zoo, and Chester Zoo have herds of just Rothschild's giraffe. Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, Busch Gardens Tampa, The Maryland Zoo, Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo, and Binder Park Zoo all have strictly reticulated giraffe herds. However, some zoos still breed Rothschild's giraffe and reticulated giraffes. At Utah's Hogle Zoo, their giraffe herd consists of male Riley, a reticulated giraffe, and females Kipenzi, a reticulated giraffe, and Pogo, a Rothschild's giraffe. In early 2016, Willow was born to Riley and Pogo. According to the new research discovered in 2016, Willow would be a hybrid. The trend of exhibiting only reticulated giraffe or only Rothschild's giraffe is becoming more popular. ==References * Cheyenne Mountain Zoo Giraffe Cam * Saint Louis Zoo, Reticulated Giraffe * The BIG zoo * Saint Louis Zoo Article reticulated giraffe Category:Mammal genera Category:Mammals of Ethiopia Category:Mammals of Kenya Category:Mammals of Somalia Category:Fauna of East Africa reticulated giraffe reticulated giraffe ","title":"Reticulated giraffe"},{"id":"41969486","text":"Hotel King () is a 2014 South Korean television series starring Lee Dong-wook, Lee Da-hae, Im Seulong, Wang Ji-hye, Lee Deok-hwa and Kim Hae-sook.

The election was scheduled in late 2013, after the mayor Dragan ƒêilas lost a non-confidence motion in the assembly. Twenty-three parties and coalitions ran for 110 seats in the Assembly, with 5% election threshold required to win seats. According to the final results, parliamentary winner Serbian Progressive Party also won 43.62% votes in Belgrade, and an absolute majority of 63 seats. Only three more lists surpassed the threshold: Democratic Party of Dragan ƒêilas with 15.7% of votes (22 seats), Socialist Party of Serbia with partners took 11.49% (16 seats) and Democratic Party of Serbia won 6.39% (9 seats). ==Background== The aftermath of the 2012 elections was radical; then's incumbent president Boris Tadiƒá lost to the oppositions counter-opponent Tomislav Nikoliƒá. This effectively led to a change of the ruling majority with the Progressives ousting and replacing the Democrats (see for more detail: Government of Ivica Daƒçiƒá). The result of the local elections, however, were considerably in favor of the Democrats and it was easy enough for mayor Dragan ƒêilas to secure a second term with a coalition of his coalition (DS along with its minor partners, the Social Democratic Party of Serbia and the Serbian Renewal Movement) with the SPS-PUPS-JS, lacking but a single vote for a majority. Over the following months there were some serious changes within the DS, with early party elections and Tadic's stepping down from the race acceding defeat and settling with an honorary presidential title, and Djilas becoming party leader; it was quickly followed by significant party-purges of those that took part in the 2008‚Äì2012 government due to political responsibility. Subsequent changes as a result were a swift decline of the DS in the opinion polls (including withdrawal from politics of a significant number of individuals, as well as a fraction breaking off and forming a new political party under the leadership of former minister Du≈°an Petroviƒá called Together for Serbia) and SNS' plummeting. It led to after restructuring the government only PUPS remaining in support of ƒêilas by late 2013, with more and more pressure for an early election in Belgrade. In the end he was outvoted in late September 2013 and the government named a provisional team to administer the capital city until early elections, headed by acting mayor Sini≈°a Mali who is closely associated with the SNS. Many parties and individuals participated in the provisional local government, but the DS withdrew from it early on; the long- lasting enforced government was perceived by the Democrats as a tyrannical act aimed at weakening their position and strengthening the Progressives' chances. As per the constitution and according laws, elections for Belgrade were finally scheduled in early 2014 for 16 March 2014. This led to a chain of results with the Progressives deciding to go on early parliamentary elections simultaneously, bringing down Ivica Daƒçiƒá's government. ==Electoral lists== The following are the electoral lists in the capital city so far proclaimed by the City Electoral Commission:http://www.b92.net/mobilni/eng/index.php?nav_id=89545 {  ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Ballot number ! style=\\"text- align:center;\\" Ballot name ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Ballot carrier ! style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Note - 1 ALEKSANDAR VUƒåIƒÜ ‚Äî FUTURE WE BELIEVE IN (Serbian Progressive Party, Social Democratic Party of Serbia, New Serbia, Serbian Renewal Movement, Movement of Socialists)  Zorana Mihajloviƒá - Milanoviƒá  - 2 IVICA DAƒåIƒÜ ‚Äî Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), Party of United Pensioners of Serbia (PUPS), United Serbia (JS) ‚Äî Milan Krkobabiƒá Aleksandar Antiƒá  - 3 DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF SERBIA - VOJISLAV KO≈†TUNICA Aleksandar Popoviƒá  - 4 ƒåEDOMIR JOVANOVIƒÜ ‚Äî LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY ≈Ωeljko O≈æegoviƒá  - 5 SERBIAN RADICAL PARTY - DR VOJISLAV ≈†E≈†ELJ Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj  - 6 UNITED REGIONS OF SERBIA ‚Äî MLAƒêAN DINKIƒÜ Mlaƒëan Dinkiƒá  - 7 CYRILLIC FOR BELGRADE ‚Äî CIVIC GROUP Marko Mandiƒá  - 8 WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR A DEMOCRATIC BELGRADE ‚Äî DRAGAN ƒêILAS Dragan ƒêilas  - 9 DEMOCRACY ‚Äî EUROPE - SERBIA Dr Milorad Paunoviƒá  - 10 THIRD SERBIA ‚Äî FOR ALL THE HARD-WORKING PEOPLE Aleksandar Protiƒá  - 11 BORIS TADIƒÜ ‚Äî NEW DEMOCRATIC PARTY ‚Äî GREENS ‚Äî TOGETHER FOR SERBIA Boris Rankoviƒá  - 12 DVERI ‚Äî VLADAN GLI≈†IƒÜ Vladan Gli≈°iƒá  - 13 CIVIC GROUP PATRIOTIC FRONT ‚Äî DR BORISLAV PELEVIƒÜ Milica ƒêurƒëeviƒá  - 14 ALLIANCE OF VOJVODINA HUNGARIANS ‚Äî ISTV√ÅN P√ÅSZTOR Neboj≈°a Marjanoviƒá M - 15 GEPS FOR BELGRADE ‚Äî PROF.

Nothing but calm blue seas as far as the eye can see, and the soothing Scots coo of narrator David Tennant.\\" Benji Wilson of The Daily Telegraph also gave it four stars out of five and said his only criticism was its format being too similar to Penguins: Spy in the Huddle, a BBC series broadcast the previous year. The Guardian Sam Wollaston called the narration \\"punny\\". In February 2014, animal rights campaigners from Animal Defenders International accused the film-makers of exploiting a captive dolphin at a marine park in Honduras to obtain some of the footage used in the series. The claims were rejected by the BBC and John Downer Productions, as the dolphin used was a tame individual free to move in the open ocean and the marine park. ==Home media== The series was released on DVD on 10 February 2014 and on Blu-ray on 17 February 2014. ==See also== *BBC Wildlife Specials ==ReferencesCategory:2014 British television series debuts Category:2010s British documentary television series Category:English- language television shows Category:Discovery Channel original programming ","title":"Dolphins - Spy in the Pod"},{"id":"41969505","text":"Mesene is a genus in the butterfly family Riodinidae present in the Neotropical realm.

It aired on MBC from February 27 to April 24, 2014 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 16 episodes. ==Plot== Na Ae-ra grew up believing she was born to be only pretty and not smart. While working at her family's restaurant, she falls in love with Cha Jung-woo, a geeky engineering graduate student studying to enter civil service. Na Ae-ra wants to become a housewife, and after Jung-woo promises that she will be, they get married. During their 100th day wedding celebration, Jung-woo announces that he has quit his job because he has an idea for a business. Jung-woo's businesses keep failing and Ae-ra struggles to keep them afloat by working multiple jobs. After secretly suffering a miscarriage from the stress of being the sole breadwinner and living in poverty, Ae-ra divorces Jung-woo after four years of marriage. Three years after the divorce, Ae-ra discovers that Jung-woo has become fabulously successful and wealthy, while she is still paying debts that accrued during their marriage. The fun begins when Ae-ra schemes for revenge, with Jung-woo believing that Ae-ra wants him back because he has become wealthy. ==CastMain characters=== *Lee Min-jung as Na Ae-ra :Beautiful but flighty, Ae-ra initially cares more about honing her looks over her life skills. Upon marriage to Jung-woo, she dreams of becoming a housewife but finds herself shouldering the sole burden of their financial needs for four years, until frustration and exhaustion drives her to divorce him. But after learning of his success, she schemes to ostensibly win back her ex-husband by becoming an intern at his company, though what she really wants from him is a belated apology and thank you. *Joo Sang-wook as Cha Jung-woo :Despite being an engineering genius, he was initially studying to become a civil servant when he meets and marries Ae-ra. To her shock, Jung-woo suddenly announces that he's quitting to become a software developer instead. Years of his business failure lead to their divorce. Jung-woo eventually creates DonTalk, a WhatsApp-like text-over-data app that becomes Korea's No.1 social networking application. Thus Jung-woo transforms from a geeky loser into the self-made, successful president of D&T; Software Ventures, a venture capital firm. *Kim Gyu-ri as Gook Yeo-jin :Smart, elegant, and capable, Yeo-jin possesses a keen insight and determination that can be intimidating, particularly given that she was born with the disposition of a boss. She is an heiress, being the daughter of the chairman of D&T; Software Ventures, where she works as a director. She nurses painful scars from a past love, but falls for her business partner Jung-woo because of his warm personality, becoming Ae-ra's rival for his heart. *Seo Kang-joon as Gook Seung-hyun :Yeo-jin's younger brother, who was once tutored by Jung-woo when he was in high school. Good- looking, rich, and caring, Seung-hyun is seemingly a perfect guy. Upon his return to Korea from overseas, he gets hired at DonTalk despite his resistance to working a desk job at his father's company; but to avoid preferential treatment, he hides his real identity. Among his fellow interns is Ae-ra, and he becomes attracted to her, notwithstanding their eight-year age difference. ===Supporting characters=== *L as Gil Yo-han :Yo-han was the part-time clerk at the PC bang where Jung-woo practically lived when he was broke, and when he hits it big, he takes the kid along and hires him as his personal secretary.

On July 20, 2009, Christie announced that he had chosen Kimberly Guadagno, Monmouth County sheriff, to complete his campaign ticket as a candidate for lieutenant governor. Guadagno, who was elected sheriff in 2007, had previously served on the Monmouth Beach Board of Adjustment, and also as an assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. Christie faced criticism for his acceptance of $23,800 in campaign contributions (and the resulting $47,600 in public finance matching funds) from a law firm that received a federal monitor contract while Christie served as the state's U.S. Attorney. In 2006, Christie approved a deferred prosecution agreement with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey after it admitted committing Medicare fraud. He appointed Herbert Stern, a former federal judge and prosecutor, to the $500-per-hour post of federal monitor. Christie's close friend and fundraiser John Inglesino, a partner in Stern's law firm, was paid $325 per hour for his work as counsel on the monitorship. Stern's law firm, Stern and Killcullen, received reported more than $10 million in legal fees from the contract. Stern, Inglesino, a third partner, and their wives have since each made the maximum contribution of $3,400 to Christie's gubernatorial campaign. On November 3, Christie defeated incumbent Democratic governor Jon Corzine by a margin of 48.5% to 44.9%, with 5.8% of the vote going to independent candidate Chris Daggett.

In most ungrounded PV systems, the PV modules with a positive or negative voltage to the ground are exposed to PID. PID occurs mostly at negative voltage with respect to the ground potential and is accelerated by high system voltages, high temperatures, and high humidity. ==History== The term \\"potential-induced degradation\\" (PID) was first introduced in the English language in a published study by S. Pingel and coworkers in 2010.Proceedings of the 35th IEEE PVSC 20‚Äì25 June 2010 pp. 2817-2822 It was introduced as a degradation mode resulting from voltage potential between the cells in the photovoltaic module and ground. Research in this field was pioneered by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, focusing primarily on electrochemical degradation in crystalline silicon http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/adv_tech/photovol/ppr_81-85/Pred%20Electrochem%20Breakdown%20-%20PVSC1984.pdf and amorphous siliconhttp://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/adv_tech/photovol/ppr_81-85/Elechem%20Degr%20of%20a-Si%20Modules%20-%20PVSC1985.pdf photovoltaic modules.

The degradation by polarization was also covered in the trade journal Photon (4/2006, 6/2006, and 4/2007). In 2007, PID was reported in a number of solar panels from Evergreen Solar (Photon 1/2008 and 8 /2008). In this case, the degradation mechanism occurring in photovoltaic modules containing the more common front junction (n+/p) crystalline silicon solar cells when the modules were in negative voltage potential with respect to ground. PID was further discussed as a problem in ordinary crystalline modules (Photon 12/2010, lecture by solar energy company Solon SE at PVSEC in Valencia 2010).

PID of the shunting type (PID-s), which is the most prevalent and most detrimental type of PID for crystalline silicon modules, was discovered to be caused by microscopic crystal defects penetrating the p-n front junction of affected solar cells. == Detection == Although, PID usually has no visual effect on the module, different photovoltaic module analysis techniques are available for detection and analysis. First, the power degradation can become visible in IV curves. infrared thermography and luminescence imaging techniques like electroluminescence and photoluminescence are also able to detect PID. ==Prevention== The PID-s that occurs in modules in negative polarity strings can be completely prevented if an inverter is used with the possibility of grounding (or effectively grounding) the positive or negative pole. This is possible if the inverter is galvanically isolated, e.g. using a transformer, if specially designed transformerless inverter topologies are used, or by altering the electric grid potential to ground. Which pole must be grounded, is clarified with the solar module manufacturer. The easiest and very effective method to prevent PID is to install a reversal device from the first day of installation. See Anti-PID manufacturers in \\"Reversal\\" section herein below. ==Reversal== If the PID effect is present in the solar module, the effect can be reversed. Six companies, Huawei, OriSolar, VIGDU, iLumen, PADCON and Pidbull have made a device that can prevent and reverse this effect. iLumen PID BOX mini iLumen nv.PADCON PID KILLER PADCON GmbHPID Solution for String Inverters Pidbull NVPID Solution for Central Inverters Pidbull NV ==References== * ^ Huawei PID Solution * ^ PID Solution * ^ PID Solution video * * ^ PID Solution * ^ PID Solution * __NOTOC__ Category:Photovoltaics Category:Solar cells ","title":"Potential-induced degradation"},{"id":"41969620","text":"Skeletal formular of mancozeb Mancozeb is a dithiocarbamate non-systemic agricultural fungicide with multi-site, protective action on contact. It is a combination of two other dithiocarbamates: maneb and zineb. The mixture controls many fungal diseases in a wide range of field crops, fruits, nuts, vegetables, and ornamentals. It is marketed as Penncozeb, Trimanoc, Vondozeb, Dithane, Manzeb, Nemispot, and Manzane. In Canada, a mixture of zoxamide and mancozeb was registered for control of the mildew named Gavel as early as 2008. ==Mechanism== Mancozeb reacts with, and inactivates, the sulfhydryl groups of amino acids and enzymes within fungal cells, resulting in disruption of lipid metabolism, respiration, and production of adenosine triphosphate. Mancozeb is listed under FRAC code M:03 The \\"M:\\" refers to Chemicals with Multi-Site Activity. \\"M:\\" FRAC groups are defined as generally considered as a low risk group without any signs of resistance developing to the fungicides. ==Toxicology== A major toxicological concern is ethylenethiourea (ETU), an industrial contaminant and a breakdown product of mancozeb and other EBDC pesticides. It has potential to cause goiter, a condition in which the thyroid gland is enlarged and has produced birth defects and cancer in experimental animals. ETU has been classified as a probable human carcinogen by the EPA.http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/haloxyfop- methylparathion/mancozeb-ext.html ==See also== *Fungicide use in the United States *Maneb ==ReferencesExternal links == * Category:Fungicides Category:Dithiocarbamates ","title":"Mancozeb"},{"id":"41969621","text":"Hybrid oncocytoma/chromophobe renal cell carcinoma is rare subtype of renal cell carcinoma.

Three separate companies operated thousands of cable cars over 82 miles of track. The three story powerhouse was built by the North Chicago Street Railroad Company in 1886-1887 for $35,000. \\"It was a striking presence in the River North area, which was a jumble of low-scale factories, warehouses and shipyards,\\" said a Commission on Chicago Landmarks Designation Report from 2000. The railroad company was organized by Charles Tyson Yerkes, the leading transit entrepreneur in Chicago during the late 19th century. At the height of his influence, Yerkes controlled eight separate street railway companies and 250 miles of track in the city. Chicago historian Greg Borzo calls the LaSalle Street Cable Car Powerhouse, \\"the crown jewel of Chicago‚Äôs cable car remnants.\\" He also notes, \\"This powerhouse drove two cables: one that pulled cable cars through a tunnel under the Chicago River along LaSalle Street and around the downtown and another shorter cable that pulled cars along Illinois Street between Clark Street and Wells Street.\\" Those cables, in turn, pulled the thousands of cable cars that, at the peak of their operation, brought approximately 100,000 workers into downtown Chicago each day. The LaSalle Street Cable Car Powerhouse helped make possible the rapid development of the city's outlying North Side neighborhoods during one of the greatest boom periods in the history of Chicago. Cable cars operated in Chicago until 1906. The LaSalle Street Cable Car Powerhouse was designated a Chicago Landmark on June 27, 2001. Today it is a restaurant.

Directed by Catherine Scott and produced by Pat Friske for Paradigm Pictures, the film premiered at the Sydney Film Festival on 11 June 2011. Subsequently, there was a public screening and reception at the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly in Canberra. Scarlet Road was a 2011 Walkley Documentary Award finalist. == Background == Wotton is a member of Scarlet Alliance, the \\"Australian Sex Workers' Association\\". In late 2000, Wotton collaborated with other prostitutes and related organisations, such as People with Disability Australia Inc., to form the \\"Touching Base Committee\\". The committee explored the concept of providing commercial sex for people with special needs and the corresponding training that would be required for participating prostitutes. As of February 2014, Touching Base is an incorporated charitable organisation based in New South Wales and provides information, education and support for clients with disabilities, prostitutes and disability service providers. Filmmaker Catherine Scott had known Wotton for 11 years when she proposed the idea for Scarlet Road; however, Wotton was initially reluctant, due to the sensitive nature of the subject matter. They continued to discuss the idea and the documentary was eventually completed over a three-year period. Wotton later commented on the documentary approach saying: \\"This film was a collaboration thing. Cathy worked closely with me and listened not just to my voice but to those of other sex workers.\\" Wotton explained her motivation for making the film in greater depth after its launch in 2011: > Part of my reason for doing the film was to wipe away the 'us and them' > mentality. We're all one car accident away from being in the same position > as these guys. Tomorrow we could all wake up out of coma and not be able to > eat let alone have sex or touch ourselves. What I say to people is imagine > the next time you go to have sex or masturbate having to call your mum and > have her organise it all for you ... People with disabilities want to be > viewed as whole beings. Think about how important your sexuality is to how > you are perceived. These people aren't seen like that, so you can imagine > how that makes them feel. Following the release of the film, Wotton stated in an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald: \\"I am a sex worker and I make my money from clients seeing me. Some clients just happen to have a disability.\\" == Reception == The film garnered a variety of positive reviews. In a 2012 article for The Age on whether movies can help overturn stereotypes surrounding sex and disabilities, Shane Green described the film as moving and noted that it: \\"continues to win international acclaim\\". Following 2012 screenings at the SXSW festival in Texas, Badass Digest reviewer Zack Carlson concluded: \\"Scarlet Road isn‚Äôt flashy, artsy or clever. It‚Äôs better than that: a plain, old effective documentary that benefits from its simplicity and objectivity.\\" Jezebel noted that some of the most uplifting moments featured mothers discussing their sons' desire to purchase sexual services. Writing for Bitch Flicks, Erin Tatum, a reviewer with cerebral palsy, said: \\"Ultimately, the audience can recognize that there‚Äôs a great deal of intersectionality in the way that both sex workers and disabled people are policed and shamed about their sexual expression. Rachel reminds us that the two groups can work together to lessen collective stigma.\\" Notably, the film has also been shown at both the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly, Canberra and Parliament House, Sydney. Wotton also briefed MPs in Adelaide before a March 2012 screening of the film as part of a broader debate about the decriminalisation of the buying of sexual services in states beyond New South Wales, and a specific call by South Australia Dignity for Disability MP Kelly Vincent for disability services funding to pay for access to sex therapy or a prostitute. == Selected screenings == *Sydney International Film Festival, Sydney, Australia (2011) *Art Gallery of New South Wales ‚Äì cast and crew screening, Sydney, Australia (2011) *SBS TV ‚Äì Australian television premiere (2011) * SXSW, Austin, US (2012) *Sheffield Doc/Fest, Sheffield, UK (2012) * 14th Annual Thessaloniki Documentary Festival, Greece (2012) *ACT Legislative Assembly ‚Äì public screening and reception, Canberra, Australia (2012) *Documentary Edge Festival ‚Äì screened as part of human rights programme, Auckland and Wellington, New Zealand (2013) *Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival, Toronto, Canada (2013) *Clinton Street Theater Sex Workers Film Series, Portland, US (2014) *Sexuality and Disability Expo, Sydney, Australia (2014) *Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI) ‚Äì with Q&A; session, Melbourne, Australia (2014) == Accolades == The film received a 2011 Walkley Documentary Award nomination, was a finalist for the Foxtel Australian Documentary Prize and won the people's choice award at the 10th Oceania Film Festival (FIFO) in Tahiti in 2013. == References  External links == * *Touching Base Category:Australian documentary films Category:2011 films Category:Australian films Category:English-language films Category:Films about prostitution in Australia ","title":"Scarlet Road"},{"id":"41969760","text":"Sir David Dundas, 1st Baronet of Richmond Sir David Dundas, (7 December 1749 ‚Äì 10 January 1826) was a distinguished surgeon who was created 1st Baronet of Richmond.

The Crusade cycle, a group of Old French chansons de geste, had associated the legend with the ancestors of Godfrey of Bouillon (d. 1100), King of Jerusalem and the hero of the First Crusade. Godfrey had no legitimate progeny, but his wider family had many descendants among the aristocracy of Europe, many of whom after his death made use of the swan as a heraldic emblem. In England such a family was that of de Bohun, Earls of Hereford and Earls of Essex. ==Usage by de Bohun== Margaret de Bohun (1311‚Äì1391), daughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford (1276‚Äì1322) and wife of Hugh de Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon (1303‚Äì1377). On her chest tomb in south transept, Exeter Cathedral, heavily restored 19th century Surviving examples of usage of the Bohun swan by the de Bohun family include: *The Counter seal of Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford (1276‚Äì1322), attached to the Barons' Letter, 1301, shows the Bohun Swan above the escutcheon and supporting its guige strap. *Two Bohun swans collared and chained with necks entwined at the feet of the effigy of Margaret de Bohun (1311‚Äì1391), daughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford (1276‚Äì1322) and wife of Hugh de Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon (1303‚Äì1377), on her tomb chest in the south transept of Exeter Cathedral. ==Extinction of de Bohun senior line== Humphrey de Bohun, 7th Earl of Hereford (1341‚Äì1373) died without male issue leaving as his co-heiresses two daughters: *Eleanor de Bohun (c. 1366‚Äì1399), the eldest, who married Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester, the fourteenth and youngest child of King Edward III (1327‚Äì1377). *Mary de Bohun (c. 1368‚Äì1394), who married King Henry IV. ==Descent== Following the extinction of the Senior male line of the de Bohun family the Bohun swan badge was used by descendants of the two heiresses: by the royal House of Lancaster descended from Mary de Bohun and by the Stafford family descended from Eleanor de Bohun and by the Junior Branch by a female Heiress in late 14th Century. ===Lancaster=== The Dunstable Swan Jewel, circa 1400, British Museum. Possibly given to his supporters by the future King Henry V, who was Prince of Wales from 1399British Museum collection database The Dunstable Swan Jewel After the marriage in 1380 of Mary de Bohun (d. 1394) to the Lancastrian Henry Bolingbroke, the future King Henry IV (1399‚Äì1413), the swan was adopted by the royal House of Lancaster, which continued to use it for over a century.Stratford; Cherry (2003), 204 The swan gorged and chained with a crown or is especially associated with Lancastrian use and echoes the white hart similarly gorged and chained used by King Richard II (1377‚Äì1399),British Museum database deposed by Henry Bolingbroke, which he began to use as a livery badge from 1390. Richard II's treasure roll of 1397 includes, together with several of his own white hart badges, a swan badge with a gold chain, perhaps presented by one of his Lancastrian enemies mentioned above: \\"Item, a gold swan enamelled white with a little gold chain hanging around the neck, weighing 2 oz., value, 46s. 8d\\".Stratford He declared to Parliament that he had exchanged liveries with his uncles as a sign of amity at various moments of reconciliation. After Henry Bolingbroke seized the throne in 1399, the use of the swan emblem was transferred to his son, the future King Henry V (1413‚Äì1422), who was made Prince of Wales at his father's coronation, and whose tomb in Westminster Abbey displays motifs of swans. The Dunstable Swan Jewel made in about 1400 is presumed to have been intended as a livery badge possibly given to his supporters by the future Henry V of England, who was Prince of Wales from 1399. It is in the form of a white enamelled swan gorged with a gold collar in the form of a crown with six fleur-de-lys tines, held by a gold chain. The Bohun swan was also used by Henry V's grandson Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, who died in the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471. In 1459 Edward's mother Margaret of Anjou insisted that he should give swan livery badges to \\"all the gentlemen of Cheshire\\"; the type and number are unknown.Cherry (2003), 205; he mistakenly calls Edward \\"Henry\\" ===Stafford=== Standard of Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, about 1475, displays badges of the Stafford knot and Bohun swan Eleanor de Bohun, Mary's sister, had in 1376 also married into the Plantagenet royal family, in the person of Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester (d. 1397), another prominent Lancastrian supporter, the youngest son of King Edward III, and the swan badge was used by his Stafford descendants, but as a secondary badge to their own Stafford knot. The de Bohun sisters Mary and Eleanor were co-heiresses to the huge Bohun estates, and disputes over the settlement of these continued until late into the next century, when most of their descendants had been killed in the Wars of the Roses, perhaps encouraging the continued assertion of Bohun ancestry. Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, a descendant of the Beauchamps, of Eleanor de Bohun, of Thomas of Woodstock and of John of Gaunt, used the swan with crown and chain as his own badge. He was certainly active in trying to obtain possession of the Bohun lands, and appears also to have plotted to seize the throne, for which he was executed in 1483 by Richard III. ===Courtenay=== Sir Philip Courtenay (d.1463) of Powderham, showing the Bohun swan as the dexter supporter Arms of Peter Courtenay (d.1492), Bishop of Exeter and Bishop of Winchester: Or, 3 torteaux a label of 3 points azure each point charged with 3 plates in pale with supporters the Bohun swans, each collared with a crown and chained or.

Luttrell of Dunster Bohun swan supporters with arms of George Fownes Luttrell (1826‚Äì1910) impaling Hood, 19th century remodelling of main entrance door to Dunster Castle The Luttrell family, feudal barons of Dunster, of Dunster Castle in Somerset, also used the Bohun swan as supporters. This was due to their descent from the Courtenays. Sir Andrew Luttrell (d.1378/81) of Chilton, in the parish of Thorverton, Devon, married Elizabeth Courtenay (d.1395), widow of Sir John de Vere, son of the Earl of Oxford, and a daughter of Hugh de Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon (1303‚Äì1377) by his wife Margaret de Bohun (d.1391), eldest surviving daughter of Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford, by Elizabeth, daughter of King Edward I. In 1374 Elizabeth Luttrell purchased the reversion of Dunster Castle and manor, the manors of Minehead and Kilton, and the hundred of Carhampton from Lady Mohun, the wife of Sir John V de Mohun, 2nd Baron Mohun (c.1320‚Äì1375), feudal baron of Dunster. Dunster Castle continued to be held by her descendants until 1976. Bohun swan supporters survive on the Easter Sepulchre monument of Hugh Luttrell (died 1522) of Dunster, in St Mary's Church, East Quantoxhead, Somerset.

Mordecai also played the lead role in Murray Roth's 1930 film \\"Yamekraw,\\" and a minor role in Dudley Murphy's 1933 \\"The Emperor Jones,\\" which starred Paul Robeson. By 1936, Mordecai was the host and master of ceremonies at The Theatrical Grill, a Harlem nightclub on West 134th Street managed by Dickie Wells (Mordecai's former dancing partner and a notorious Harlem gigolo -- not to be confused with jazz trombonist Dicky Wells). A Jimmie Mordecai was cited, along with one Arizona Coffman, in a February 15, 1943 conviction in the City Magistrates Court of the City of New York, for selling liquor without a license from the basement of a Harlem establishment called the Frog Club, but it is unclear that this is the same Jimmy Mordecai. Mordecai died in New York City on May 7, 1966 from a heart attack. He left a wife, Lucille Graves, and three children. == References == Category:American male dancers Category:American tap dancers Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing ","title":"Jimmy Mordecai"},{"id":"41969899","text":"Kelly McGonigal (born October 21, 1977) is a health psychologist and lecturer at Stanford University who is known for her work in the field of 'science help' which focuses on translating insights from psychology and neuroscience into practical strategies that support health and well-being. Mainstream media articles about inner-conflict-related aspects of modern lifestyles regularly quote her. A longtime advocate of self-compassion and mindfulness as stress- coping strategies, McGonigal has lately altered her focus on the problematic aspects of stress; in a talk at the TEDGlobal 2013, she emphasized the importance of an individual's subjective belief in themselves as someone who is able to cope successfully as being a crucial factor in their actual response to stress. == Background and career == McGonigal, who is the identical twin of game designer Jane McGonigal, was brought up in New Jersey by public school teacher parents who emphasized intellectual attainment.ELLE Magazine, June 22, 2011 Super girl Although she is now grateful for their protectiveness, McGonigal says it seemed like \\"lockdown\\" at the time, she describes her upbringing as \\"both good and stressful\\". She received a B.A. in Psychology and a B.S. in Mass Communication from Boston University, and her Ph.D. from Stanford University, where she is a lecturer in psychology and teaching a public course on willpower. Kelly McGonigal's website About ===Advocacy=== A practitioner of meditation, McGonigal was the chief editor of peer-reviewed journal the International Journal of Yoga Therapy from 2005 to 2012 and advocated yoga and similar mindfulness practices as a way to re- charge and direct attention and mental resources so as to achieve desired outcomes. The rationale was based on studies on the effect of meditation on the brain, and the Ego depletion model, also called the 'strength' theory of self-control, proposed by a team led by Roy Baumeister. McGonigal's simple summary of the 'strength' theory of self-control: \\"Self-control is like a muscle. When used, it gets tired\\".Watson, D.L., Self-Directed Behavior: Self- Modification for Personal Adjustment, 10th ed. (2013) Cengage Learning, page 4 As a writer and researcher on self-control, McGonigal has frequently been cited for her views on how willpower can be built up and directed.New York Times, January 6, 2012, At the Table  Candle 79, You Say You Made a Resolutionwashingtonpost.com live Q and A, July 24, 2007, Debt and Stress, Kelly McGonigalMississippi Business Journal blog September 4, 2013Molbray. Scot, Huffington Post, 10/12/13 Who is thin and whyMundahl, Steven, The Alchemy of Authentic Leadership (2013) Balboa Press, page 42NBC Today show 'Willpower' is key to keep New Year resolutions Having emphasized the role of meditation practices for fighting stress to enable better functioning in challenging circumstances, McGonigal altered her standpoint somewhat in 2013, and now emphasizes the attitude taken to stress as the crucial factor.Huff post Lifestyle, Jan Bruce, 09/30/2013 Stress is good == Willpower == McGonigal defines willpower as \\"the ability to do what you really want to do when part of you really doesn't want to do it\\", and says that humans experience conflicts between impulse and self-control in personal and social contexts, giving examples such as: craving for sweet foods, the urge to be sarcastic or complaining, and the desire to procrastinate. Humans have evolved adaptations to control their instincts and successfully resist impulsive drives, because living in groups requires self-control and this‚ÄîMcGonigal says‚Äîmeans taking the harder option. According to McGonigal, willpower failure or success can spread through a group, because humans tend to mirror the behavior of those they are socially connected with. The part of the self that enables us to act in a way that is consistent with our long-term goals is based in the prefrontal cortex, and McGonigal advocates body-mind practices that she says prioritize the function of the prefrontal cortex, rather than parts of the brain that are orientated toward instant responses, which is the brain's default setting when under stress.Revive Your New Year's Resolutions. Parade Magazine February 19, 2012 According to McGonigal, the practice of meditation is an effective way to establish the primacy of the prefrontal cortex, thus enabling a choice to do the harder thing, when that is required for attaining a long-term goal. McGonigal believes exercising self-control can help build up willpower in the same way as, over time, physical exercising can increase capacity to exercise. She says: \\"If you do it with awareness and intention, it can make you stronger. The strength develops over time, even if you feel temporarily weaker. But I think this only works when you have this mindset, and feel like you are consciously choosing to \\"use\\" your willpower. If you feel like you are being drained by everything you \\"have\\" to do (or not do), that lack of autonomy is even more stressful than exercising self- control.\\"Kelly McGonigal's comment on The Willpower Instinct The promise of happiness from cravings often misleads in McGonigal's view, and she gives techniques of mindfully focusing attention on the actual experience when indulging a craving or temptation, so as to compare it with the expectation of reward that preceded it. One use of willpower that McGonigal sees as counter productive is thought suppression, or trying not think about temptations (such as cravings). McGonigal believes thoughts become more intrusive through thought suppression, and it is best to simply register that an unwanted thought has occurred without believing in it or acting on it. Energy to pursue activities is less scarce than to resisting temptation, says McGonigal, suggesting that people give their brains healthy \\"wants\\" such as vegetables or a walk after lunch, so that weight loss becomes a by-product of choice.Los Angeles Times, April 05, 2014, Lily Dayton, Sprinkling of willpower Learning to be a friend and mentor to ourselves rather than equating self-control with self-criticism is the attitude that she advocates.Kelly McGonigal website: The Willpower Instinct ==Stress as a friend== In a talk given at TEDGlobal 2013 that has more than 20 million online views on the TED website, McGonigal said she had re-evaluated her ideas about stress in the light of new research on how the beliefs held about stress, such as thinking of stress as bad, can affect health. Citing a study suggesting that those who believe stress is bad for them suffer an adverse effect on their life expectancy, she now emphasizes that choosing to view one's stress response as helpful creates the \\"biology of courage\\", while connecting with others under stress can create resilience.June 11, 2013, TED Blog, The upside of stress: Kelly McGonigal at TEDGlobal 2013Kristen Shorten, news.com.ua, October 2, 2013, Killer or saviour? Why everything we think about stress is wrong According to McGonigal, \\"[t]he old understanding of stress as an unhelpful relic of our animal instincts is being replaced by the understanding that stress actually makes us socially smart ‚Äì it's what allows us to be fully human.\\"TEDGlobal 2013, Speakers.

He was the starting quarterback of the Texas Longhorns for one game in 1989, and a backup from 1986-1989. He was the second black quarterback to ever start a game for the University of Texas. ==High school== Donovan Forbes was a three- sport star athlete at Baytown Sterling where he made all-District in football, basketball and baseball. He was voted to the 1985 Texas High School All-Star team by the Texas High School Coaches Association and was ranked as one of the top ten quarterback recruits in the South. As a sophomore, he played defensive back and he started at quarterback in both his junior and senior years of high school. He was also a starter on the basketball team where he earned All- District first team honors and a star pitcher in baseball as well. ==College Football== Forbes was a tall, strong-armed quarterback adept at running the option whose career never met up to its promise as he struggled with weight, injuries, academic issues, fumbles and limited opportunities. After redshirting for the 1985 season he spent 1986 as a back-up quarterback to Bret Stafford. He first saw playing time in the Oklahoma game in which he and Stafford combined to complete a then school record 22 of 39 passes in a losing effort. He saw limited action in 3 other games that season. Forbes played in only one game, against Oregon State, in 1987,http://stats.texassports.com/sports/m-footbl/archive/stats/87/plyr_8.htm and only two games in 1988. But he played an important, if infamous, role in the last of those 1988 games. In the final game of the season, against in- state rival Texas A&M;, Texas had come back from a 28-point deficit to trail by only 4 with 4 minutes left. With Texas threatening to score again, Forbes was brought into the game with Texas on the Aggies 34 yard line and 3:20 left in the game. On a 3rd down option play, Forbes made a bad pitch which the Aggies recovered, and Texas never got the ball back again. Texas finished the season at 4-7, its worst record since 1956. In spring practices in 1989, Forbes had performed well, and he was expected by most to compete for the starting job in the fall, but he was then dismissed from school for academic reasons in May and was only able to play in the fall after a successful appeal. He came into the summer practices still expected by some to start, but didn't get his chance until the end of the season; and then, only because of injuries to starting quarterback Peter Gardere. Late in the season against TCU, Gardere suffered a shoulder injury in the 2nd quarter and backup Mark Murdock was ineffective, giving Forbes his chance. He rallied the Longhorns from a 17-10 deficit, completing 8 of 9 passes for 117 yards including a 36-yard touchdown pass to Kerry Cash to win 31-17 and was then named the Associated Press Southwest Conference offensive player of the week. A minor quarterback controversy arose as a result, but despite Forbes' play the week before, Gardere got the start against Baylor the next week. Texas got off to a bad start and Gardere was pulled in the first half for Forbes who wasn't able to do much better as Texas lost 50-7. In the last game of the season and the final game of his career, Forbes finally got his one chance to start when Peter Gardere was ailing.http://www.michaelcorcoran.net/sports-2 Texas took an early lead in that game, and was up 10-7 at halftime, but could not overcome several miscues from every aspect including two missed field goals, a wide open A&M; receiver in the UT secondary, a penalty for too many people on the field that turned a botched A&M; punt into another TD for A&M;, and three interceptions and a fourth down pass incompletion by Forbes. == References  External links == *Career Statistics Category:Living people Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Texas Longhorns football players Category:People from Baytown, Texas Category:Players of American football from Texas Category:Sportspeople from Harris County, Texas Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Donovan Forbes"},{"id":"41969932","text":"The African Center for Economic Transformation (ACET) is a non-profit Accra- based think tank.

There were 43 reported tropical cyclones, including 27 that attained typhoon status. The first storm was observed in February, and the first typhoon formed two months later, killing three people along Mindanao. Several storms formed in June and July, including reports of a typhoon in the newspapers that killed 52 in South Korea, and another typhoon reported in newspapers that killed one person on Samar after dropping heavy rainfall. The strongest typhoon of the season originated in July and attained a minimum pressure of , as reported by a ship northeast of the Philippines. On August 18, a typhoon moved near or over northeastern Luzon, killing nine people. In early September, a typhoon passed through the Bonin Islands south of Japan and later moved near Kyushu; heavy rainfall caused a reservoir to collapse in ≈åita Prefecture, killing 50 people. On September 18, a typhoon caused a tram collision in Tokyo due to poor visibility, killing 20. Another typhoon struck southern Taiwan on September 29, causing 50 fatalities. On October 19, Wake Island recorded typhoon-force winds for the first time since observations began five years prior. A strong typhoon passed near Guam on November 3 with winds of 200 km/h (125 mph), damaging most of the buildings on the island and killing five. Three storms affected the Philippines in December, the second of which was the most notable; it killed 63 people and left 75,000 homeless on Catanduanes. The third of the Philippine storms dissipated on December 24, ending activity for the season. There was another December typhoon that killed two people on a ship to the northeast of Guam. ==Systems== Data for most of the storms were provided through the World Wide Consolidated Tropical Cyclone data file known as TD-9636. The document utilized several sources to indicate where storms were located, and as a result there were duplications. During the season, the Philippine Weather Bureau issued monthly bulletins, which later provided info for tropical cyclone tracks. The agency used weather stations that were established by Spain and the United States after each country ruled over the archipelago. The weather data ceased in August 1940, which were later rebuilt in 1945. Also in 1940, meteorology records were disrupted in Hong Kong, which were later restored in 1947, due to World War II. ===February and April=== On February 1, a tropical cyclone formed over western Mindanao in the Philippines. It moved northwestward across Palawan island and was last noted later on February 1. Historical weather maps show only a circulation near 9 N 121 E. This was a weak system, likely a depression but may have been a weak Tropical Storm. Two months later, a tropical depression developed on April 9 to the east of Yap in the western Caroline Islands. It moved west- northwestward, passing south of the island without gaining much intensity. The depression later bypassed Palau to the north, dissipating on April 13 about 400 km (250 mi) west-northwest of the island. On April 23, a tropical cyclone was observed east of Palau, moving to the west-southwest. It curved south of the island before turning to the west-northwest.

Search Sweet Country was reissued by McSweeney's in 2012, with an Introduction by Binyavanga Wainaina. Reviewing it in The Slate Book Review, Uzodinma Iweala writes: \\"Reading Search Sweet Country is like reading a dream, and indeed at times it feels like the magical landscapes of writers like the Nigerian Ben Okri or the Mozambican Mia Couto. Each page delivers an intense blast of vivid imagery, a world in which landscapes come to life when inanimate objects receive human characterization.... Laing ... is a master stylist, and Search Sweet Country delivers an absorbing, if demanding, world for both its characters and the reader.\\"Uzodinma Iweala, \\"'I Only Want a Little Authenticity!'

The film explores the brony phenomenon, the adult fan base of the children's animated show My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic that arose shortly after its premiere in 2010. The film is structured around the journey of Ashleigh Ball, one of the principal voice actresses for the show, including her initial reactions to learning of this older fanbase, and her travel as a Guest of Honor to one of the first fan conventions BronyCon held in New York City in 2012. Hodge, a close friend of and previous collaborator with Ball, was curious as she was as to this phenomenon and opted to film her travel and appearance at the convention for the documentary. Hodge's film gained interest of film producer and publisher Morgan Spurlock who helped to promote wider distribution of the documentary. Initially slated to be shown for Vancouver-area film festivals, the film was highlighted at the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City, and received critical praise. The film received a wider theater release starting in July 2014, and is currently available on DVD, Blu-ray, Digital Download and On Demand. The film's Blu-ray was sold for the first time at the 2014 New York Comic Con. The film also screened in 290 theaters across Mexico in late 2014. ==Synopsis== Ashleigh Ball, one of the lead voice actresses in Hasbro's My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, begins to notice that she is receiving fan mail for her work on the show, but is perplexed over the fact that most of it is coming from teenagers and adults. These fans, who call themselves \\"bronies\\" and are mostly male, take the show's themes and messages of personal responsibility and friendship to heart. Ball accepts an invitation to attend the Winter 2012 BronyCon, a then-semiannual fan convention held in New York City, as a guest of honor and takes the opportunity to meet the fans. Footage of Ball's interviews and travels is intercut with segments focusing on different fans of the show, including: a burly motorcycle mechanic and former college football player, a United States Army veteran who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, the producer of an Internet radio network, and a husband-and-wife team of psychologists who became interested in the show after learning about it from their son. Andrea Libman and Nicole Oliver, two other members of the voice cast, make brief appearances. The film also includes footage and interviews from the Canterlot Gardens fan convention held during mid-2012 near Cleveland, as well as footage from live performances of Ball's band, Hey Ocean! ==Production== While focusing on Ball's trip to BronyCon, the film also briefly features fellow My Little Pony voice cast members Nicole Oliver and Andrea Libman. Director Brent Hodge said that he funded the film himself, and felt it was easy to film as he personally knew Ashleigh Ball. He decided to film as a \\"fly on the wall\\" at the meetups so as to not interfere with the goings on and to see the brony world as it really is. During a panel at BronyCon 2013, Hodge went into detail on the film, and showed a trailer to the audience, and revealed that the idea had come about when Ball was asked to do the convention. In an interview with Everfree News, Hodge went into detail on the film, explaining that it was an outsider view on the brony community that had evolved from simply a documentary on Ball and her voice career. ==Promotion and release== The film was originally planned to be part of the local Vancouver DOXA Documentary Film Festival on May 11, 2014, where it was selected to close out the show. To Hodge's surprise, the film was selected as one of five special documentary screenings for the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival and was named one of the top 10 movies to see at Tribeca by Indiewire. The film premiere screening at Tribeca was sold out within hours, and its screening there has brought more attention to the film, according to Hodge. The film was picked up in April 2014 by an independent film distribution company, Morgan Spurlock Presents, a collaboration between Spurlock's Warrior Poets, Virgil Films, and Abramorama. A Brony Tale is the first film distributed under this label. Along with the Tribeca premiere and prior to the selected theatrical release, the film had film festival screenings in Vancouver, British Columbia, Seattle, Washington, Wellington, New Zealand, Auckland, New Zealand, and has screenings scheduled in Mexico City, Mexico, Monterrey, Mexico and Guadalajara, Mexico via the brony convention FluttyCon 2014 and The Brony Chef. The film was released on July 8, 2014 in at least twenty different theater markets within North America and was released for home media via Video-On-Demand and DVD/Blu-ray and cable. ==Reception== The film has received positive reviews. It currently holds an 80% score with an average rating of 6.7/10 based on reviews from 9 critics on aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes. Christopher Campbell of Movies.com praised Brent Hodge's directing, noting how Hodge \\"situates the phenomenon inside an identifiable world rather than setting it aside like it's some kind of otherness.\\" Campbell went on to say in his review, \\"They're compared to the jazz crowd of the 1920s and to the Beatniks and, most assuredly, to the hippies . . . Hodge comes closer to making those of us who can't possibly get it at least start to comprehend what is really going on here and why. If we all joined them in not necessarily watching and playing with and dressing up as My Little Pony but at least in following its message and influence, then the planet would be a much better place.\\" John Lucas of Straight.com said, \\"Brent Hodge's documentary about fans of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic suggests that there is no such thing as a typical \\"brony\\"; the subjects here include a sensitive Iraq War veteran and a burly motorcycle mechanic...A connecting thread is provided by Vancouver-based voice actor Ashleigh Ball... by the end Ball is touched by the realization that she's an integral part of something much larger than a kiddie show.\\" Marina Antunes of Row Three called the film \\"the best documentary I've seen on the subject\\", and went on to applaud the film, saying that the film \\"has the advantage of a filmmaker who understands storytelling and Hodge does an excellent job not only of capturing the energy and passion of the fans but packaging that up in a documentary that is both entertaining and informative.\\" IGN gave the film a score of 9.1, praising the portrayal of the fandom, interviews, the scientific study of bronies, and subject of gender roles. However, criticism was voiced regarding the lack of staff from the show, and the story about a military brony having no conclusion. ==Awards== The film was screened as an \\"Official Selection\\" at the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival, the 2014 New Zealand Documentary Edge Festival, the 2014 Seattle International Film Festival, the 2014 DOXA Documentary Festival, the 2014 SouthSide Film Festival and the 2014 Las Vegas Film Festival. The film won \\"Best Documentary\\" at the Las Vegas Film Festival and has been nominated for 4 Leo Awards, at the 2015 Leo Awards, in \\"Best Documentary Feature\\", \\"Best Direction in a Documentary Feature\\", \\"Best Sound in a Documentary Feature\\" and \\"Best Music in a Documentary Feature\\". The film won the 2015 Leo Award for \\"Best Sound in a Documentary Feature\\". ==See also== * Bronies: The Extremely Unexpected Adult Fans of My Little Pony, a 2012 documentary film * Hey Ocean! * My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic ==References External links == * * * Category:My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic Category:2014 films Category:2014 documentary films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian documentary films Category:American films Category:American documentary films Category:New Zealand films Category:New Zealand documentary films Category:English-language films Category:Documentary films about fandom Category:Canadian independent films Category:Films directed by Brent Hodge Category:American independent films Category:New Zealand independent films Category:2014 independent films ","title":"A Brony Tale"},{"id":"41970023","text":"Dimitar Drazhev (; 15 September 1924 ‚Äì 16 February 2014)–ü–æ—á–∏–Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ. –î–∏–º–∏—Ç—ä—Ä –î—Ä–∞–∂–µ–≤ was a Bulgarian alpine skier.
