Buckley Jr. from 1966 to 1999, and relaunched in 2018 with host Margaret Hoover. Under Buckley, 1,504 episodes over 33 years made Firing Line the longest-running public affairs show in television history with a single host. The program, which featured many influential public figures in the United States, won an Emmy Award in 1969. ==Broadcast history== Original host Buckley in 1985 Firing Line began on April 4, 1966 as an hour-long show (including breaks) for commercial television, syndicated by WOR-TV in New York City, where it ran for 240 episodes. It was mainly seen on weekends in low-rated afternoon or late-night time slots, because of the program's admitted appeal to a small, \\"high-brow\\" demographic group. In 1971, Firing Line moved to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) under the auspices of the Southern Educational Communications Association, an arm of South Carolina Educational Television. This was somewhat unusual, given the reputation among many conservatives that PBS unfairly discriminated against non-liberal viewpoints in its other programming. SECA/SCETV, however, was one of the very few public broadcasting entities of the time that was sympathetic to the conservative movement. On top of this, the program had already been carried by a number of individual PBS (and its predecessor National Educational Television) stations for a number of years. Because the program received a relatively unfavorable Sunday evening timeslot on PBS' schedule in the early 1970s, Buckley and long-time director Warren Steibel briefly attempted to return Firing Line to commercial TV, but could not find sponsors. Thus, the program would remain on PBS until Buckley and Steibel discontinued production on December 17, 1999, with Buckley's final episode airing December 26, 1999. In April 2018, PBS announced that it would begin airing a new Firing Line, hosted by Margaret Hoover. ==Buckley tenureShow format=== Although the program's format varied over the years, it typically featured Buckley interviewing, and exchanging views with, a guest, while seated together in front of a small studio audience. Standing or sitting further away in the studio, an \\"examiner\\", typically a liberal, would ask questions, generally toward the end of the show. Most guests were intellectuals or those in positions of power, being notable in the fields of politics, religion, literature and academia. Their views could either sharply contrast or be in strong agreement with Buckley's. Reflecting Buckley's talents and preferences, the exchange of views was almost always polite, and the guests were given time to answer questions at length, giving the program a leisurely pace. \\"The show was devoted to a leisurely examination of issues and ideas at an extremely high level\\", according to Jeff Greenfield, who frequently appeared as an examiner. John Kenneth Galbraith said of the program, \\"Firing Line is one of the rare occasions when you have a chance to correct the errors of the man who's interrogating you.\\" The show might be compared in politeness and style of discourse to other national public interview shows, specifically those hosted by Richard Heffner, Charlie Rose or Terry Gross, but Buckley was clearly interested in debate. In a 1999 Salon.com article, The Weekly Standard editor William Kristol summarized Buckley's approach to the show: \\"Buckley really believes that in order to convince, you have to debate and not just preach, which of course means risking the possibility that someone will beat you in debate.\\" Buckley was not averse to asking tough questions of friendly guests, either, according to Tom Wolfe who recalled the interviewer asking him whether there were really any original insights in his book The Bonfire of the Vanities. Buckley and his producer, Warren Steibel, used various methods over the years to bring extra perspectives to the show. In the early years, there would often be a panel of questioners. In 1977 the panel was replaced by an \\"examiner\\" who played a larger part in the proceedings. Examiners varied, with Jeff Greenfield, Michael Kinsley, Harriet Pilpel, and Mark J. Green appearing most frequently. When the show was shortened to 30 minutes in 1988, the role of examiner was eliminated, but there was often a moderator, whose role was similar to that of the moderator in a formal debate. The moderator would introduce both host and guest, and then ask the opening question. Starting in 1978, scattered among the regular broadcasts were occasional specials and two-hour formal debates, with opening statements, cross-examination, and closing statements. In 1988, at Buckley's request, the running time of regular program shows was reduced from one hour to a half-hour. Beginning in March 1993, the two-hour formal debates would often be followed by half-hour shows in which most or all of the participants engaged in informal discussion. In the 1980s and 1990s, the debate episodes were frequently broadcast on the Monday evenings after PBS pledge drives concluded. A recurring episode that Buckley had rebroadcast every Christmas, beginning in 1981, was an interview he did with Malcolm Muggeridge at his home in Sussex, England. The title of the episode was \\"How Does One Find Faith?\\" The episode deals with questions that are religious and spiritual in nature. ===Buckley's persona=== Buckley's distinctive mannerisms were prominently displayed by the program and were part of the public images of both the show and Buckley. Buckley was frequently seen leaning far back in his chair, a pen near his mouth and a clipboard in hand. His flicking tongue, widening eyes, and flashing smile also characterized his style, as did his multi-syllabic vocabulary. Buckley's voice was widely satirized as, for instance, by Robin Williams in the animated movie Aladdin. At the same time that guests were treated politely, Buckley might also gently mock them, particularly if he was friendly with them, as with John Kenneth Galbraith or examiner Mark J. Green. \\"You've been on the show close to 100 times over the years\\", Buckley once asked Green. \\"Tell me, Mark, have you learned anything yet?\\" When Allen Ginsberg asked if he could sing a song in praise of Krishna, Buckley acceded and the poet chanted \\"Hare Krishna\\" repeatedly as he played dolefully on a harmonium. According to Richard Brookhiser, an associate of Buckley's, the host commented that it was \\"the most unharried Krishna I've ever heard\\". Buckley's celebrated politeness sometimes wore thin: in a 1969 debate with linguist and political activist Noam Chomsky, Buckley said \\"I rejoice in your disposition to argue the Vietnam question, especially when I recognize what an act of self-control this must involve.\\" Chomsky acknowledged that \\"[s]ometimes I lose my temper. Maybe not tonight.\\" \\"Maybe not tonight\\", Buckley said, \\"because if you would I'd smash you in the goddamn face.\\" (This comment was a joking throwback to Buckley's famous response to Gore Vidal, when, during another Vietnam debate, Vidal called Buckley a \\"crypto-Nazi\\".) Buckley addressed his guests as \\"Mr.\\" or \\"Mrs.\\" He once called Margaret Thatcher \\"Margaret\\" because he thought she had addressed him as \\"Bill\\". He was embarrassed later when he saw the transcript and realized she had been referring to a legislative bill. He immediately wrote a personal letter of apology to the Prime Minister. For the show's 15th anniversary in 1981, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Vernon Jordan, Henry Kissinger, and Louis Auchincloss presided over a party for Buckley at the New York Yacht Club. ===Guests=== Prominent guests on the program included: * Politicians and statesmen: Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger, Harold Macmillan, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Enoch Powell, Ron Paul, George Wallace, Ian Smith, Jesse Jackson, Newt Gingrich, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Barry Goldwater, Clare Boothe Luce, John Kerry, George H.

The show premiered on June 2, 2018 on WNET, which serves the New York metropolitan area, and is the largest PBS market in the country. The show maintains the original format of deep exchange of ideas with a single guest on a single issue within its 26-minute runtime. It is produced weekly at the WNET Tisch Studios. ===Episodes=== The first fourteen episodes of the program featured guests representing a variety of sociopolitical ideologies, including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Ohio Governor John Kasich, Journalist Gretchen Carlson, Senator Jeff Merkley, ‚Äúthe rising star of the political Left,‚Äù Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and ‚Äúaccidental icon of the conservative movement,‚Äù Jordan Peterson. Margaret Hoover's interview with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez earned national and international attention for her comments ranging from the state of capitalism and the unemployment rate in the United States to the State of Israel. The former governor of New Jersey Chris Christie was interviewed in which he referred to the crimes that Jared Kushner‚Äôs father committed as 'loathsome'. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas declared in his interview that the U.S. could defeat Iran with, \\"two strikes. The first strike and the last strike.\\" ===Reception=== The New York Times wrote that, ‚ÄúUnder Ms. Hoover's direction, the discourse is civil and substantive.‚Äù A show review by the National Review states, ‚Äúthe reincarnation of Firing Line comes at an interesting time, and a needful one.‚Äù In the run-up to the show's television premiere Politico said, \\"It seems like a great idea, so let‚Äôs test drive it and see what happens.\\" CNN Anchor Poppy Harlow stated that Firing Line with Margaret Hoover ‚Äúis appointment television in my house‚Äù on CNN Newsroom. Hoover has made multiple television appearances for the Firing Line reboot, including ones on Good Morning America, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and Real Time with Bill Maher. In May 2019 Hoover was awarded Journalist of the Year by The Algemeiner for her work as host. ===Guests=== * Bill Nye * Ayaan Hirsi Ali * Max Boot * Gretchen Carlson * John Kasich * DeRay Mckesson * Jeff Merkley * Peter Navarro * Paul Ryan * Jeff Weaver * Randi Weingarten * Stacey Abrams * Tamika Mallory * Chris Christie * Tony Blair * Ann Coulter * Tom Cotton * Adam Schiff * Steve Bannon * Jos√© Andr√©s * Michael Bloomberg * Jim Mattis * Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez * John Hickenlooper * Oliver North * Andrew McCabe * Ted Cruz * Tulsi Gabbard * Michael Moore * Sean Penn * Elise Stefanik ==Theme music== Beginning with the move of the program to public television in 1971, the theme music of Firing Line was the Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 in F Major, Third Movement (Allegro assai), by Johann Sebastian Bach. ==Availability of Episodes: Online and DVD == A number of episodes of the show have been released on DVD by the Hoover Institution Library & Archives at Stanford University, and are sold exclusively through Amazon.com, which also makes episodes accessible via Amazon Video. As well as that, for a slightly higher price, the Hoover Archive will supply unreleased episodes on DVD through its website. Episodes with playlists by year are now available on YouTube. Digitized audiovisual recordings and transcripts of more than 1,500 Firing Line episodes were contributed to the American Archive of Public Broadcasting via external links from The Hoover Institution Library and Archives at Stanford University. ==References== ==Further reading== * On the Firing Line: The Public Life of Our Public Figures, by William F.

The parish had a population of 1,682 at the 2011 Census. It is adjacent to Weston-on-Trent and near Chellaston, very close to the border with Leicestershire. On the north bank of the River Trent, about a mile from the river on rising ground, it is out of its flood plain. The Trent and Mersey Canal runs between the village and the river. All Saints‚Äô Church is Celtic. There are two public houses, the White Hart and The Malt. ==History== In 1009 √Ü√æelr√¶d Unr√¶d (King Ethelred the Unready) signed a charter at the Great Council which recognised the position and boundaries of Westune.Aston on Trent Conservation Area History , South Derbyshire, accessed 25 November 2008 The land described in that charter included the lands now known as Shardlow, Great Wilne, Church Wilne, Crich, Smalley, Morley, Weston and Aston on Trent. Under this charter √Ü√æelr√¶d gave his minister, Morcar, a number of rights that made him free from tax and enabled his own rule within the manor.Charter of √Üthelred, The Great Council, 1009, accessible at Derby records This manor came under the control of the King again following Morcar being murdered in 1015 and the lands were later given to √Ülfgar, the Earl of Mercia, but he lost this at the Norman Conquest. Aston is in the Domesday book where it is mentioned as an outlying farm of Weston-on-Trent and listed amongst the lands given to Henry de FerrersDomesday Book: A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 2003. p. 749 by the King. The land given to HenryHenry de Ferrers held a considerable number of manors including a massive number in Nottinghamshire given to him by the King. These included obviously Aston on Trent, but also included Barrow upon Trent, Breaston, Chellaston, Etwall, Hungry Bentley, Markeaton, Normanton, Spondon and Swarkestone included of land that was valued at eight shillings. The name is of Anglo-Saxon descent ('ton' an Old English suffix meaning farm). Being in the east, the name literally means 'East Farm'. The 'On-Trent' suffix of both Aston and nearby villages simply means they are near the river Trent. Shardlow and Great Wilne were included in the parish of Aston-on-Trent until 1838, when Shardlow constructed its own church. ==Notable residents== General Sir Drury-Lowe was born here and William Darwin Fox was born nearby. Edward Holden, Joseph Greaves and James Sutton were High Sheriffs of Derbyshire. See also below for three England footballers. ==Education== The village has its own infant and junior school and is in the catchment area of Chellaston School. ==Recreation== Football in Aston is over 100 years old and in that time the village has developed at least three players who went on to play for England. Aston-on-Trent was the birthplace of three men who all played football for England within a six-year spell. They were Harry Linacre (1881‚Äì1957), who was a goalkeeper for England and Nottingham Forest, and his uncles Fred and Frank Forman.Harry Linacre, englandfootballonline.com, Retrieved 12 March 2016 Harry was picked for England twice in 1905 helping them to victory both times. All three men were also originally signed by Derby County and then sold on to Nottingham Forest. Today Aston-on-Trent F.C. consists of both a Saturday side playing in the Midlands Regional Alliance, and a Sunday side playing in the Derby Taverners League. 2013/14 saw the Sunday side win the cup double, building on many years' work to climb through the various divisions of the Long Eaton leagues, where they also won the Premier League and cup double. ==See also== *Aston Hall *Charles Paget *Edward Anthony Holden ==References== ==External links== * Aston-on-Trent website * Aston-on-Trent F.C. * Category:Villages in Derbyshire Category:Civil parishes in Derbyshire Category:South Derbyshire District ","title":"Aston-on-Trent"},{"id":"819383","text":"James Fischer (December 27, 1927 ‚Äì July 3, 2004) was an American engineer, who developed high-purity silicon technology for Texas Instruments.

The show was syndicated on PBS until 2017 and is owned by Charlie Rose, Inc. Rose interviewed thinkers, writers, politicians, athletes, entertainers, businesspersons, leaders, scientists, and fellow newsmakers. On November 20, 2017, WNET, Bloomberg Television and PBS announced the suspension of distribution of the show after former employees of Charlie Rose, Inc. alleged Rose sexually harassed them. Bloomberg Television also pulled reruns of the series within only an hour's notice. The next day, both PBS and Bloomberg cancelled distribution of the program and terminated their relationship with Rose; this effectively cancelled the show in a de facto manner. CNNMoney reported on November 29 that Rose called the show's staffers and let them know they would be paid until the end of the year and released from their contracts at the start of 2018; their access to the Bloomberg headquarters where the show recorded to remove personal effects would be terminated on December 8. On December 4, it was announced that Amanpour, a CNN International interview program hosted by Christiane Amanpour, would re-air on PBS as an interim replacement for Charlie Rose. The show was ultimately replaced by Amanpour as Amanpour & Company. ==History== The show premiered on September 30, 1991. It was formerly presented by WNET, where it first aired as a local program. The program was additionally broadcast by Bloomberg Television with a week delay, which formerly provided the show's recording facility. The set was simple, set up with an all-dark surrounding space around an oak round table used since the program debuted and purchased by Rose himself, along with accompanying chairs. Funding for the show was primarily provided by donations from various corporations and charitable foundations. The program was criticized for not disclosing their list of donors within their underwriting disclosure. In 2010, Rose and co-host Eric Kandel began The Brain Series, episodes featuring neuroscientists and other experts; the series was later released on DVD. In October 2014, a segment called \\"Al Hunt on the Story\\" was launched as a \\"regular feature interview\\"; Hunt's first interview under this banner was with Secretary of State John Kerry. The show was formerly taped at 731 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan, where Bloomberg Television and Bloomberg L.P. are based.\\"About\\", Charlie Rose.

The group was first called \\"Amenaza\\",Amenaza: Cuban rap \\"threat\\" or \\"menace\\" in Spanish, and appealed to the Cuban youth who were hungry for African-American culture consisting of hip hop and rap. The group is based in France where they made a deal with a record company, although they visit Cuba frequently. In 1999 Fidel Castro threw a party for them and had a meeting with all the musicians.Stephen Foehr, Dancing with Fidel, pg. 39 It was the first time the Cuban government showed support for hip hop music. The group was and still is popular in Europe (especially France, Italy, Spain and Portugal) and Latin America. Yotuel Romero and Ruzzo Medina, who moved from Havana to Paris as part of an international studies program, joined Rold√°n Gonz√°lez and Flaco-Pro to form the band in 1999. Their work is influenced by the hip hop movement as well as Cuban and other Latin rhythms. , they had produced a total of five studio albums and a greatest hits album; their latest album is Gourmet (released May 25, 2018). In 2009 they participated in the concert Paz Sin Fronteras II in Plaza de la Revoluci√≥n, Havana, Cuba. Orishas reunited to record new material in 2016. The name \\"Orishas\\" refers to the set of deities worshipped in African-based religions in the Americas, like Santer√≠a in Cuba and Candombl√© in Brazil, resulting from the relocation of Yoruba slaves.

The transition to Europe was critical in their musical career, as many rap groups in Cuba lacked the resources for professional recordings. In fact, of the hundreds of rappers in Cuba, Orishas is the only group that has achieved international acclaim . Their first album, A Lo Cubano, was released in Spain in May 1999 under the Orishas moniker. In the summer of 1999, Orishas began a two-year tour across Europe and the United States, which brought them international notice. In December 2000, Orishas returned to Cuba to perform two concerts, attracting tens-of-thousands of young Cubans. As one of Cuba's pioneer rap groups, Orishas garnered fame both at home and abroad. In 2006 they guested on the Track \\"14Me\\" recorded in Cuba by occasional The Black Eyed Peas producer Poet Name Life.

In some cases it is thought to come from the Welsh word ', meaning giant. ==A== * Adriane Carr (born 1952), Canadian academic, activist, & British Columbia Green Party politician * Alan Carr (born 1976), British stand-up comedian & TV presenter * Alexander Carr- Saunders (1886‚Äì1966), British biologist, sociologist and academic * Alice Comyns Carr (1850‚Äì1927), British costume designer * Allan Carr (aka Allan Solomon; 1937‚Äì1999), American film producer and manager of actors & musicians * Allen Carr (1934‚Äì2006), British author of books on how to quit smoking * Amanda Carr (disambiguation), multiple people * Andrew J.

The CDC consists of national civic leaders from a multitude of political orientations and has an advisory board composed of over fifty civic organizations that it claims broadly reflects the composition and concerns of the electorate. The CDC states that it was formed because the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) fails to adequately serve voters' interests and charges that the CPD, which was created by the Republican and Democratic parties, secretly awards control of the presidential debates to the Republican and Democratic candidates, thereby limiting voter choice and restricting subject matters of political discourse. The CDC claims to aim to host presidential debates that serve American voters, not political parties, first. The CDC promises to set fair candidate selection criteria, feature innovative and engaging formats, and resist anti-democratic demands of participating candidates. The CDC also promises to operate with full transparency and reverse the decline in debate viewership (Under the tenure of the CPD, debate viewership has dropped by over 25 million viewers.) ==Participant selection criteria== The Citizens' Debate Commission (CDC) employs criteria developed by the Appleseed Citizens' Task Force on Fair Debates, a project of the Appleseed Electoral Reform Project at American University's Washington College of Law. The Appleseed Task Force criteria includes all candidates on enough state ballots to win an electoral college majority who either 1) register at five percent in national polls or 2) register a majority in national polls asking eligible voters which candidates they would like to see included in the presidential debates. The Appleseed criteria attempts to ensure that popular third party challengers are allowed to participate without drowning out the voices of the two leading contenders for the presidency. In 1984 and 1988, only the major party candidates fulfilled the Appleseed criteria; in 1996 and 1992, only H. Ross Perot and the major party candidates managed to meet the Appleseed threshold; and in 2000, only Ralph Nader, Pat Buchanan and the major party candidates satisfied the criteria. The CDC says the two prongs of the Appleseed criteria that trigger inclusion, five percent and majority support, are sensible because they are rooted in democratic principles and federal law. The five percent threshold matches the public financing threshold for minor parties, which is the only legislative standard for measuring the viability of non-major parties. Elected officials codified five percent in the Federal Election Campaign Act, and taxpayers finance candidates whose parties attract five percent of the popular vote. ==Format== The Citizens' Debate Commission advocates the following format stipulations for future presidential debates: #Follow-up questions must be permitted in every debate. #At least one debate must include candidate-to- candidate questioning. #At least two debates must include rebuttals and surrebuttals. #Response times must not be overly restrictive. #Candidates may only exercise a limited number of vetoes concerning the selection of moderators and panelists. The Citizens' Debate Commission also proposes the following four basic formats for future presidential debates: #Two single- moderator debates. #Authentic town-hall debate. #Youth debate. #Panel debate. ==External links== * Citizens' Debate Commission * Commission on Presidential Debates * Open Debates * Some documentation of limited debate topics under CPD control, compiled by a CDC advocate. * The Appleseed Citizens' Task Force on Fair Debates Category:Organizations established in 2004 Category:United States presidential debates ","title":"Citizens' Debate Commission"},{"id":"819439","text":"June Gloom conditions prevailing at Seal Beach in late morning, June 2013. June Gloom is a California term for a weather pattern that results in cloudy, overcast skies with cool temperatures during the late spring and early summer. While it is most common in the month of June, it can occur in surrounding months, giving rise to other colloquialisms, such as \\"May Gray\\", \\"No-Sky July\\", and, rarely, \\"Fogust\\". Low-altitude stratus clouds form over the cool water of the California Current, and spread overnight into the coastal regions of Southern California. The overcast skies often are accompanied by fog and drizzle, though usually not rain. June Gloom usually clears up between mid- morning and early afternoon, depending on the strength of the marine layer, and gives way to sunny skies. On a strong June Gloom day, the clouds and fog may extend inland to the valleys and Inland Empire and may persist into the mid-afternoon or evening. A combination of atmospheric and oceanic conditions must be just right in order for June Gloom to form, and these conditions usually align only around May and June of each year. These include the marine layer effect common to the West Coast of the United States, an atmospheric inversion caused by subsidence of high-pressure air from the subtropical ridge, and sufficiently cool ocean water off the coast. The June Gloom pattern is also enhanced by the Catalina eddy local to southern California. May and June together are usually the cloudiest months in coastal Southern California. June Gloom is stronger in years associated with a La Ni√±a, and weaker or nonexistent in years with an El Ni√±o. This weather pattern is relatively rare, and occurs only in a few other parts of the world where climates and conditions are similar. Scientists study the cloud fields that make up June Gloom to increase understanding of cloud behavior at the onset of precipitation. ==Description== Satellite image of a strong June Gloom day, showing marine layer clouds covering the coastal regions of the counties of Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego. The San Fernando Valley and San Gabriel Valley also are covered, with clouds spilling inland as far eastward as San Bernardino. A Catalina eddy is visible near the center. A typical June Gloom morning consists of marine stratus clouds covering the coast of southern California, extending a varying distance inland depending on the strength of the June Gloom effect that day. The clouds, which are formed by the marine layer, move in at night, usually after midnight, and typically dissipate in the late morning, giving way to clear, sunny skies. During a heavy June Gloom season, the condition may persist into the afternoon, or even all day during an exceptionally strong event. Often, the air is saturated with moisture, and fog also develops, along with frequent light mist and occasional drizzle. Fog and drizzle normally are found near the furthest inland extent of the gloom, where the cloud deck is closest to the ground. By late morning to early afternoon, solar heating usually is sufficient to evaporate the clouds, and the sun emerges. The phenomenon forms earliest and lasts longest at the coast, with weaker effects as it moves further inland. When the marine layer is strong and deep, clouds can fill the Los Angeles Basin and spill over into the San Fernando Valley and San Gabriel Valley, even extending into the Santa Clarita Valley and Inland Empire on exceptionally strong June Gloom mornings. If conditions are not as strong, the Basin may be filled while the valleys may be clear. It is not uncommon for motorists to drive over the Sepulveda Pass from the clear, sunny San Fernando Valley and plunge into a cloudy, fog-filled Los Angeles. On a weak June Gloom morning, the clouds and fog may only be present within a mile or two of the coastline, affecting only the beach cities. ==Climate effects== The months of May and June are typically the cloudiest months of the year in coastal southern California, having only 59% and 58% sunny days, respectively, on average in San Diego.San Diego Union Tribune, June 8, 2004 The number of days in May and June that are \\"gloomy\\" vary from year to year. Anomalies in sea surface temperature can be used to forecast the length and intensity of the June Gloom phenomenon in a given season. Years with warmer ocean temperatures, referred to as El Ni√±o, may result in fewer gray days in May and June.San Diego Union Tribune, May 7, 2010 Cooler ocean temperatures, associated with La Ni√±a, usually foretell a more gray period. The climate charts below show a clear drop in the mean monthly sunshine hours and percent possible sunshine for the months of May and June, which are the two months when the June Gloom pattern is the strongest. June Gloom has been reported by some Californians to bring on symptoms consistent with seasonal affective disorder, although this is not well-supported by evidence. However, the normally-very-sunny Los Angeles climate also is home to people who thrive during the brief seasonal respite the gloom provides from the unending sunshine and clear skies. In the early 20th century, this phenomenon was sometimes known as the high fog. A long June Gloom season, extending late into the summer, is known as Summer Bummer. The negative effects of a long June Gloom on the coastal California tourism industry is often reported in the local news media. The phenomenon can be especially disorienting to visitors from inland areas who, coming from the summer heat, would not expect cool temperatures and clouds and fog at the beach. ==Formation== A weak, shallow layer of clouds hovering over the coast of California, typical of the dissipation of the marine layer later in the day. A very well-formed and distinct Catalina eddy directly west of San Diego. The marine layer clouds over the land have dissipated. 400px The low-altitude stratus clouds that make up the June Gloom cloud layer form over the nearby ocean, and are transported over the coastal areas by the region's prevailing westerly winds. The sheet-like stratus clouds are almost uniformly horizontal, covering large areas but having relatively shallow depth of . These clouds begin to form when wind mixes moisture from the ocean surface into the air. The air cools and expands as it is mixed and moves upward, and this cooling increases the relative humidity. When the relative humidity reaches 100%, the water vapor condenses into liquid water droplets and the clouds begin to form. The stable top of the marine layer, a result of the temperature inversion, prevents any dry, warm air from above the inversion from mixing with the stratus deck. This confines the stratus deck to a relatively narrow vertical band in the atmosphere, allowing it to strengthen. The inversion layer is crucial to the formation of the marine stratus that produce June Gloom. Compression and warming of air sinking out of the North Pacific High-pressure system (which is strongest during the summer) meets with the rising, cooling air from the sea surface, producing a very stable layer of air that caps the cool air from rising any further. The strength of this subsidence inversion affects the strength of the marine layer, and how long it will take the clouds to dissipate. Additionally, the cool ocean water of the California Current, which flows out of the cold Gulf of Alaska, enhances the contrast between the cool air below the inversion layer and the warm air above it. A stronger inversion layer ‚Äì one with a greater difference in temperature between the air above and the air below ‚Äì often results in more and deeper marine layer clouds that persist longer into the day. Upwelling of colder-than-normal ocean water, associated with a La Ni√±a, can strengthen this effect even more. Once this marine layer has formed, the prevailing westerly winds advect the clouds over the coastal lands. The extent of inland advection is limited by southern California's coastal mountain ranges. The winds will continue to push the cloud layer onshore until they encounter mountains at or above the altitude of the clouds themselves, with the mountains then preventing any further inland progress of the marine layer. The foothill regions of these mountains experience some of the thickest fog and drizzle, as they are essentially in the clouds at this point. The marine layer clouds of a June Gloom day usually are at their maximum at dawn, when the surface air is at a minimum temperature and the temperature difference in the inversion layer is at its maximum. The air beneath the inversion base being at its coolest also makes it likely that it will be saturated with a relative humidity of 100%. A sea breeze, which is caused by the temperature and pressure difference between warm areas inland and the cool air over the ocean, often develops on warm summer days as well, increasing the on-shore flow pattern and maintaining a constant flow of marine stratus clouds onto the coastal areas. A strong low pressure system passing over southern California will produce the deepest and most extensive June Gloom marine layer. The marine layer effect is weakened when a weak high pressure system is in place over the region, and the marine layer will be very weak or nonexistent when there is a strong high-pressure system affecting southern California. The National Weather Service graphic on the right explains the effects of atmospheric conditions upon the marine layer and local weather conditions in more detail. ==Similar weather elsewhere in the world== While many parts of the world commonly have an offshore marine layer of stratus or stratocumulus clouds, other locations matching the daily and seasonal effects of Southern California's June Gloom are relatively rare. These include the western coast of Peru, the Macaronesian Islands, the western coasts of Morocco and Portugal, and Namibia in southern Africa. ==Actinoform clouds and drizzle prediction== Actinoform clouds imaged by the MODIS instrument on board the Terra satellite. Researchers have discovered that the cloud fields forming June Gloom and related phenomena from other west-coast marine-influenced climates are excellent places to find and study actinoform clouds. These clouds have been found to be present more often than expected in common stratocumulus layers. These clouds are persistent year-round off the coast, but are only drawn inland during June Gloom events and related phenomena elsewhere in the world. Observations suggest that when marine stratus is present alone, drizzle is minimized. However, scientists believe that the presence of actinoform clouds within the marine stratus is indicative of an increase in drizzle and the onset of precipitation. Observation and computer modeling have shown that the shape of the cloud fields actually rearrange themselves when the clouds start to rain. ==See also== *Climate of Los Angeles *Inversion (meteorology) *Marine stratocumulus *San Francisco fog ==Notes== ==References== Category:Weather lore Category:Fog Category:Climate of California Category:Rain Category:Southern California Category:Weather events in the United States ","title":"June Gloom"},{"id":"819465","text":"Rainier Brewing Company (1878‚Äì1999) was a Seattle, Washington, company that brewed Rainier Beer, a popular brand in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Although Rainier was founded in 1884, the Seattle site had been brewing beer since 1878. The beer is no longer brewed in Seattle, nor is the company owned locally. In the late 1990s, the company was sold to Stroh's, then to Pabst Brewing Company, though Miller contract brews most of Pabst's beers. The brewery was closed by Pabst in 1999 and sold. The brewery itself is a well-known fixture in the south end of town, adjacent to I-5 just north of the Spokane Street Viaduct. The plant is also home to the Tully's Coffee headquarters, Bartholomew Winery, Red Soul Motorcycle Fabrications, as well as artist lofts, band practice spaces, and a recording studio. The trademark red neon \\"R\\" that sat atop the building was replaced with a green \\"T\\" built by Western Neon, when Tully's was using the plant to roast coffee. The neon \\"R\\" is now on display at Seattle's Museum of History and Industry which was refurbished by local Seattle sign company Western Neon. The green \\"T\\" was removed on September 30, 2013 by Tully's, and a red neon replica \\"R\\", built by Western Neon, returned to the top of the brewery on October 24, 2013. The brand is currently owned and operated by Pabst Brewing Company. In Canada, it is brewed and distributed by Sleeman Breweries as Rainier Lager. ==HistoryOrigins=== 1912 Rainier ad in The Seattle Republican newspaper. The original brewery dates all the way back to 1854 when A.B. Rabbeson opened Washington Brewery, which was Seattle‚Äôs first commercial brewing company. In 1872, Rabbeson renamed his brewery Seattle Brewery. They launched Rainier beer in 1878 and would produce and distribute Rainier for the next decade. Concurrently, John Kopp and Andrew Hemrich founded Seattle Brewing and Malting in 1883. In 1888, Rabbeson sold his brewery, along with the Rainier brand, to Kopp and Hemrich. ===The Prohibition era=== Kopp and Hemrich produced Rainier beer in Washington until 1916, when the state of Washington enacted its own prohibition, 4 years before the 18th amendment enacted the nationwide prohibition.Greg Lange, Saloons close on the eve of Prohibition in Washington state on December 31, 1915., HistoryLink, November 6, 2003. Accessed 1 December 2007. During this time they opened a brewery in San Francisco where they brewed Rainier beer until 1920 when the 18th amendment was ratified. The company survived prohibition by producing a variety of different nonalcoholic products. ===Post-Prohibition relaunch=== Following the repeal of the Prohibition, the brewery was purchased by Lethbridge, Alberta brewers Fritz and Emil Sick, who then repurchased the Rainier brand and began brewing Rainier in 1935. The brewery went through several names, such as Sick's Seattle Brewing and Malting and Sicks Rainier Brewing Company, during the 1935‚Äì1977 period. Sick's Seattle Brewing & Malting Co. Brewery, also known as Bayview Brewery or simply as \\"The Brewery\\", now the headquarters of Tully's Coffee. After Rainier Brewing Company resumed producing \\"Rainier Beer\\" after the end of Prohibition and its advertisements became ubiquitous in the Seattle-Tacoma area, a rumor began circulating that the brewery's owner, Emil Sick, had bribed a Washington state committee with free beer to name the local mountain \\"Rainier\\". This, however, is an urban legend and can still be heard today among Tacoma residents who preferred the alternate name of \\"Mount Tacoma\\". Sick did, however, purchase the local baseball team and named them the Seattle Rainiers for this purpose. Sick's also brewed Rainier at a branch brewery in Spokane. The Spokane brewery closed in 1962. ===Creative packaging=== From 1952 to 1964, Rainier came packaged in a series of decorative beer cans known as the Rainier Jubilee Series. First in the series were a set of Christmas cans marketed in late 1952 and again in late 1953; these cans are rare and highly collectible today. The Christmas cans proved such a success that Rainier's use of decorative Jubilee Series cans continued for over a decade, with thousands of different designs. Most of these are not as rare and collectible as the Christmas cans, but the \\"reindeer\\" cans (which were sold only in Alaska), and the first pull tab Jubilee cans (made only in the last couple of years of the Jubilee Series) are also considered rare. Other brands of beer brewed by Sick's Rainier Brewing during this time included Rheinlander and Sick's Select. Later, the Rainier brewery would also take over brewing Heidelberg beer after its brewery in Tacoma, Washington, closed. Each of these brands (as well as rival Northwest brands Lucky Lager, Olympia, and Blitz-Weinhard) were once staples in the Pacific Northwest beer market, but starting in the 1960s and 1970s began losing market share to the major national brands. ===1970s and 1980s advertising campaigns=== 1907 Rainier Beer advertisement During the 1970s, Rainier ran a number of memorable television ads in the Pacific Northwest, largely conceived by Seattle designer Terry Heckler,Paul Dorpat and Walt Crowley, Rainier Beer -- A Snapshot History, HistoryLink, February 18, 1999, revised February 8, 2001. Accessed 1 December 2007. assisted by several of his staff, especially Ed Leimbacher, writer/producer for Rainier print, radio and TV for a dozen years. Sound man Joe Hadlock of Bear Creek Studio joined the colleagues of Heckler Bowker for 14 years of creating noise and music for these advertisements. Some of these surrealist advertisements noted by Seattle Magazine included the Running of the MFRs (Mountain Fresh Rainiers) (a parody of Running of the Bulls featuring bottles with legs), and frogs that croaked \\"Rainier Beer\\" (a motif appropriated many years later by Budweiser). Mickey Rooney appeared in several TV ads, most notably a parody of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald's \\"Indian Love Call\\" from the 1936 MGM film Rose Marie. Mickey was dressed in a Mountie costume alongside his wife Jan as they sang. (Most airings of this commercial ended with Rooney pouring a bottle of Rainier into her proffered glass, but occasionally a version was aired in which he poured the beer into her cleavage.) A commercial ad featured a motorcycle that revved \\"Raiiiiiiiii- nieeeeeeeer-Beeeeeeeer\\" while zooming by along a mountain road was notable in the early 80s. A version of this commercial that played on radio featured the sounds of different brands of motorcycles making the \\"Rainier Beer\\" revving sound.) Other ads featured a Lawrence Welk double (played by actor Pat Harrington, Jr.) leading his band in \\"The Wunnerful Rainier Waltz\\", complete with bubble machine and soloists blowing on beer bottles; and a performance of a parody of the song \\"You're the Tops\\" while thousands of Rainier bottle caps fell like dominoes in a giant \\"R\\" frame. (The whole commercial was reportedly shot on the first take, a great relief since it took all day to set up.) Rainier also produced humorous posters such as a \\"National Beergraphic\\" parody of a National Geographic Magazine cover depicting tourists encountering an MFR in the forest, and a Flash Gordon/Star Wars poster, \\"Fresh Wars\\", that recalled the bar scene in Star Wars: Episode 4. There were even costumed MFRs that made promotional appearances at supermarkets during this period. Several commercials were parodies of movies, TV shows and famous spokespeople of the time. For example, a couple made references to popular Saturday Night Live skits: one with a Gilda Radner lookalike in her role as Roseanne Roseanneadanna in a Weekend Update skit for Rainier Lite commercial; another had characters called the R-Heads, which was a reference to the Coneheads, with Rainier 'R' logos on the top of their heads. Two commercials featured a Tarzan character where his yell is \\"Raaaiiinn-iiieeer!\\". A commercial featured a silhouette of Alfred Hitchcock who would morph into a beer bottle. Another commercial featured a John Houseman imitator when Houseman at the time was a spokesperson for Smith Barney. Another series of commercials featured a Lee Iacocca impersonator walking through stacks of beer cans. One final series of commercials was the Rambo like character called \\"R-bo\\", played by Dan Roland. The \\"R-bo\\" commercials were filmed in three parts; only two of those commercials aired, however. The third commercial was never seen, because Rainier Brewery was bought out by another brewing company. ===Demise=== In 1977 the brewery was sold to G. Heileman Brewing Company, and passed through several more hands before finally winding up owned by Pabst, which closed it in 1999. The Rainier brand was sold to General Brewing Company, which moved production to the Olympia brewery in nearby Tumwater, Washington. The Olympia Brewing Company closed in 2003. Rainier Beer is now brewed under contract in Irwindale, California. In 1999, Sleeman Breweries of Guelph, Ontario, a division of Sapporo Breweries, acquired Stroh Canada which owned the Canadian rights to a folio of brands, including Rainier. Sleeman then became the Canadian manufacturer and distributor. In 1987, Rainier was awarded a silver medal by the Great American Beer Festival in the category of Best American Light Lager. The GABF recognized Rainier again in 1990, 1998, and 2000 with the gold medal for Best American-Style Lager as well as silver medals in the same category in 2003 and 2005. Both Rainier Light and Rainier Ice have received medals, in their respective categories, from the GABF. ==Rainier \\"R\\" logo== Rainier Beer on Washington State's Mt. Saint Helens with Mount Rainier in the background The red Rainier \\"R\\" logo has become an icon of the Rainier Brewing Company, dating back to the 1900s. The logo has gone through a few redesigns, having adopted the current \\"R\\" logo since the 1950s. Before that, the logo contained baseball style word mark with the \\"R\\" logo, shown in early 1900s advertisements up until the 1950s. After that, the word mark changed to go with the revised \\"R\\" logo, and it is still being used today. In 1953, a large red neon \\"R\\" logo sign was created and placed atop the brewery. After Tully's leased the brewery in 2000, they replaced the iconic \\"R\\" with a green neon Tully's \\"T\\" sign. The original red \\"R\\" sign was sold to the Museum of History & Industry (MOHAI), in which it is now on display at its new location at South Lake Union, Seattle. On September 18, 2013, Tully's (under new owners) decided to replace the green \\"T\\" with a replica of the red \\"R\\" sign. The green \\"T\\" sign was removed on September 30, 2013, and the new red \\"R\\" sign was installed on October 24, 2013. The replica \\"R\\" sign is different from the original \\"R\\" sign; along with the new \\"R\\" having lights on both sides, the new sign is made of lighter aluminium, and it has LED lights, requiring them to only replace the lights every five to seven years.

After gaining access to a cooler of beer that belonged to campers, the bear avoided cans of Busch beer and used its claws and teeth to open and then consume the cans of Rainier. A wildlife agent said at the time that \\"this is a new one on me ... I've known them to get into cans, but nothing like this. And it definitely had a preference.\\" * In the A&E; 2012 television series Longmire, the series' main character Sheriff Walt Longmire exclusively drinks Rainier beer, and can be seen drinking it throughout the series. In the pilot episode, a colleague accuses Longmire of drunk driving after empty beer cans are found in his car; Longmire explains the presence of the empty beer cans by saying \\"Every man who's ever had a beer with me will tell you the same thing‚ÄîI drink Rainier, always have, always will. Those beer cans, they weren't Rainier, none of them. I picked 'em up because I hate looking at litter.

The term is primarily used to characterize such schools in Japan. Juku typically operate after regular school hours, on weekends, and during school vacations. ==History== Juku attendance rose from the 1970s through the mid-1980s; participation rates increased at every grade level throughout the compulsory education years. This phenomenon was a source of great concern to the Ministry of Education, which issued directives to the regular schools that it hoped would reduce the need for after-school lessons, but these directives had little practical effect. Some juku have branches in the United States and other countries to help children living abroad catch up with students in Japan. While new media have been introduced into juku as instructional and delivery methods, traditional teaching is increasingly shifting to individual tutoring. This shift is partly a response by the supplementary education industry to declining numbers of children in Japan and the threat this decline poses to their industry. ==Structure and curriculum== There are two types of juku, academic and nonacademic. ===Academic juku=== Academic juku can be roughly divided into categories. * Locally based middle- or small-sized cram schools * Schools for salvaging dropouts or children who avoid regular school (free schools, etc.) * Franchising cram schools * Other miscellaneous types of cram schools As of 2011, almost one in five children in their first year of primary school attended after-class instruction, rising to nearly all university-bound high schoolers. The fees are around ¬•260,000 ($3,300) annually. Academic juku offer instruction in the five required subjects: mathematics, Japanese language, science, English, and social studies. They are best known and most widely publicized for their role as \\"cram schools\\", where children (sent by concerned parents) can study to improve scores on upper-secondary school entrance examinations. However, as seen above, there are also juku that provide supplementary education, whether remedial courses to help children falling behind in their studies, refresher courses to explain material in further detail, or courses that cover material on a higher level and thus appeal to children bored by the standardized class structure. ===Nonacademic juku=== Many other children, particularly younger children, attend nonacademic juku for piano lessons, art instruction, swimming, and abacus (soroban) lessons. ==Social influence== Juku also play a social role, and children in Japan say they like going to juku because they are able to make new friends. Many children ask to be sent because their friends attend. Some children seem to like juku because of the closer personal contact they have with their teachers and, for students in crowded spaces like Tokyo in particular, the relief jukus can provide from small homes, family, television, Internet, and other distractions. To some observers, juku represent an attempt by parents to exercise a meaningful measure of choice in Japanese education, particularly for children attending public schools. ==ControversyCriticism=== Because of the commercial nature of most juku, some critics argue that they have profit rather than education at heart. Shares in five juku chains are traded publicly, and 25 others were as of 1992 ready to issue stock as well. Not all students can afford to attend juku, but school and university test scores rise in direct proportion to spending on juku. The average fee is $160 a month for elementary school and $175 a month for junior high school, but the best ones are several times that amount. Japan spent $10.9 billion on tutoring and cram schools in 1991 alone, including $9 billion on juku for students in the ninth grade or below \\"almost double the figure spent [in 1985].\\" With poor students therefore at risk of falling behind, the social and economic inequality in what had been a relatively egalitarian approach to education, at least in public schools through ninth grade, is why Japan's powerful teachers' union does not support the juku institution. In response to these accusations, > \\"juku teachers and administrators say that since their schools are profit- > making enterprises, they have to guarantee results to succeed. The results > are easy to measure since they depend on how many graduates pass the > examinations for private school. The profit motive, in other words, provides > an incentive to create an atmosphere in which students want to learn.\\" > \\"The rise of juku is praised as a secret of Japanese success, a healthy > reflection of a system of advancement based on merit. It is also criticized > as forcing a new generation to surrender its childhood out of an obsession > with status and getting ahead. 'Juku are harmful to Japanese education and > to children,' said Ikuo Amano, professor of sociology at the University of > Tokyo. 'It's not healthy for kids to have so little free time. It is not > healthy to become completely caught up in competition and status at such a > young age.'\\" For some, \\"the schools are also seen as reinforcing a tradition of rote learning over ingenuity.\\" ===Merits=== In many ways, juku compensate for the formal education system's inability or unwillingness to address particular individual problems. \\"In a 2008 government survey, two-thirds of parents attributed the growing role of juku to shortcomings in public education,\\" such as the abolition of Saturday schooling (which therefore reduces the number of hours available to cover course material) and the reduction of curricular content (see Yutori education). Juku offer a more personalized service \\"and many encourage individual inquisitiveness when the public system treats everyone alike.

During his career he won the top division championship on three occasions and came close to becoming the first foreign-born grand champion, or yokozuna, prompting a debate as to whether a foreigner could have the necessary cultural understanding to be acceptable in sumo's ultimate rank. At a peak weight of he was also at the time the heaviest wrestler ever in sumo, earning him the nicknames \\"Meat Bomb\\" and \\"Dump Truck\\".Franz Lidz \\"Meat Bomb\\", 05.18.92 - Sports Illustrated ==Early career== Atisano'e entered sumo in July 1982 at the age of 18, recruited by another Hawaiian-born wrestler, Takamiyama of the Takasago stable. A promising student at the University High School in Honolulu, he initially wanted to be a lawyer and was also offered a music scholarship to Syracuse University. His father had regular work with the US Navy but had to support eight children. Atisano'e regarded Takamiyama as a local hero and found the opportunity to join sumo too good to resist. Due to his potential he was given the name Konishiki, after the 17th Yokozuna, Konishiki Yasokichi I (see List of yokozuna) who came from the same training stable at the end of the 19th Century (during the Meiji period in Japan) and Konishiki Yasokichi II (a komusubi in the beginning of the 20th century). Atisano'e was the sixth \\"Konishiki\\" in history, though he was the third to reach the top division. He rose to the privileged sekitori ranks in just eight tournaments, a remarkably rapid rise. He made his debut in the top makuuchi division in July 1984, and in the following tournament in September he defeated two yokozuna, Chiyonofuji and Takanosato, and was runner-up with a 12‚Äì3 record. He was promoted to komusubi for the first time in May 1985 and sekiwake in July 1985. However, he suffered an injury to his coccyx (caused by a stool collapsing underneath him) and had to sit out all the next tournament. In May 1986 he suffered another injury, this time in competition, during a bout with Futahaguro. Konishiki came back strongly from this setback and three consecutive double figure scores in 1987 earned him promotion to ≈çzeki. ==≈åzeki== Many people expected Konishiki to quickly make his push for yokozuna promotion. His stablemaster, the 46th Yokozuna Asashio Tar≈ç III had predicted Konishiki would reach the top rank by his 25th birthday. However, his increasing weight caused a strain on his knee, exacerbated by previous high-school football injuries, which badly affected his performances. After a string of mediocre 8‚Äì7 scores he turned in a disastrous 3‚Äì12 in September 1988. His problems continued in 1989 and a 5‚Äì10 mark in September left him in danger of demotion from ≈çzeki once again. He made a spectacular comeback in November 1989, taking his first tournament championship with a 14‚Äì1 record. He was the first foreigner to win a top division title since Takamiyama in 1972. In March 1990 he took part in a three-way playoff for the title but he was outshone by Asahifuji, who earned promotion to yokozuna in July. In May 1991 Konishiki won 14 consecutive bouts but was beaten in a playoff on the final day by Asahifuji. ===Close to yokozuna=== By late 1991 Konishiki was a strong yokozuna candidate. He had overcome his injuries and showed much more consistency. Yokozuna Chiyonofuji and ≈ånokuni had both recently retired, and Asahifuji and Hokutoumi were struggling with illness and injury. Konishiki took advantage by winning two championships (his 2nd and 3rd overall) in November 1991 and March 1992, with a record in the last three tournaments of 38 wins and 7 losses. However, he was denied promotion to yokozuna, with the chairman of the Yokozuna Deliberation Committee, Hideo Ueda, announcing, \\"We wanted to make doubly sure that Konishiki is worthy to be a grand champion. Therefore, we decided to wait for another tournament.\\" Another member of the committee, Noboru Kojima, said in an interview that Konishiki did not possess hinkaku, a word derived from hin meaning \\"grace, elegance and refinement.\\" His remarks were given the headline, \\"We Don‚Äôt Need a Foreign Yokozuna\\" by a newspaper. The New York Times subsequently quoted Konishiki as saying, \\"If I were Japanese, I would be yokozuna already.\\" The Japan Sumo Association demanded an apology. Konishiki held a press conference in which he tearfully denied making the remarks, insisting that one of his personal attendants had impersonated him, but the damage had been done. The media furor hampered his preparations for the forthcoming tournament which resulted in a mediocre 9‚Äì6 record. Konishiki never came close to promotion again. ==Later career== Konishiki and his entourage, May 1996 Konishiki retained his ≈çzeki ranking for 39 tournaments over more than six years, but he eventually lost it in November 1993 after two consecutive losing records. However, he continued to compete in the top division as a maegashira for another four years. Now weighing over , he was very susceptible to belt throws and slap downs by lighter and more agile opponents. Even though he enjoyed less success, he became progressively more popular with Japanese fans due to his continuous fighting spirit, distinctive bulk and amiable personality. In November 1997, he faced demotion to the second j≈´ry≈ç division and announced his retirement after 15 years in sumo. In addition to his chronic knee problems he had been suffering from gout and a stomach ulcer. He said that in spite of his setbacks \\"I'm glad that I've continued with sumo, because I've learned a lot from sumo, and I've also learned the Japanese language and life style.\\" He had spent 81 consecutive tournaments in the top division and won 649 bouts there. ==Fighting style== Early in his career, under the instruction of his first stablemaster, Konishiki was primarily oshi-sumo specialist, preferring pushing and thrusting techniques such as oshi-dashi and tsuki-dashi that would win the bout as quickly as possible. Following his knee problems in 1988 and 1989, his balance suffered and as his weight continued to increase he began to change his style, preferring to bide his time by grabbing the opponent's mawashi and rely on his huge weight advantage to wear them out. By 1992 he was winning virtually all his matches by yori-kiri (force out), and his lack of ability to change tack once he had been sidestepped was one of the concerns raised by the Yokozuna Deliberation Committee when he was up for promotion. His peak weight of recorded in March 1996 was the heaviest ever for a sumo wrestler until surpassed by ≈årora in 2017. ==Life after sumo== Konishiki remained in the Japan Sumo Association as an elder for a short time under the name of Sanoyama, before branching out as a Japanese entertainer under the name \\"KONISHIKI\\" (the capitalization is an effort to reflect the association's requirement to write his name in the Roman alphabet, after prohibition of spelling it out in Japanese characters after his retirement from sumo). In 2000 Shinichi Watanabe, director of Excel Saga and Puni Puni Poemy, created an anime series called Dotto! Koni-chan, in which Koni, the protagonist, is a fat child who strongly resembles KONISHIKI. In January 2004 he married his girlfriend of two years, former medical worker Chie Iijima. He had previously married former model Sumika Shioda in 1992, but they divorced amicably in December 2000. In 2006, he played in the film \\"Check It Out, Yo\\" Chekeraccho!! and also made a short appearance in the movie The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. He is the host of an NHK children's program called Nihongo de Asobo („Å´„Åª„Çì„Åî„Åß„ÅÇ„Åù„Åº) which teaches children traditional and colloquial Japanese. He is known as \\"Koni-chan\\" on the show. Although he continued to DJ for his FM Yokohama show Kony Island, he took a hiatus from Japanese celebrity life for a year in 2007, returning to Hawaii to prepare for gastric bypass surgery. Although he did not have high blood pressure or any heart problems, he had not lost much weight since his retirement, and underwent the operation in February 2008. He announced on his website that the operation went smoothly and that he has since lost . He returned to Japan in May 2008. After sumo, he began to turn his talents to music, most notably with his collaboration with Rimi Natsukawa as well as L-Burna on the song 'Livin Like Kings'. He often sings and raps in a mixture of English and Japanese. Konishiki can also play the ukulele. Following the 2011 earthquake, Konishiki has been a high-profile fund-raiser for disaster relief in the stricken regions of Japan.

The term \\"neoclassical ballet\\" appears in the 1920s with Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, in response to the excesses of romanticism and post-romantic modernism.Serge Diaghilev: Ballet Impressario It draws on the advanced technique of 19th-century Russian Imperial dance, but strips it of its detailed narrative and heavy theatrical setting while retaining many key techniques, such as pointe technique. ==History and development== Neoclassical ballet is a genre of dance that emerged in the 1920s and evolved throughout the 20th century. Artists of many disciplines in the early 1900s began to rebel against the overly dramatized style of the Romantic Period. As a result, art returned to a more simplistic style reminiscent of the Classical Period, except bolder, more assertive and free of distractions. This artistic trend came to be known as Neoclassicism. The ballet choreographer who most exemplified this new, clean aesthetic, was George Balanchine. As a child, the importance of classicism was imprinted on him when he was a student at the famed Imperial Ballet School, which was (and remains) steadfast in its firm commitment to classical ballet technique. Upon his graduation, Balanchine earned the privilege of choreographing for the Ballets Russes, where he had the opportunity to collaborate with Picasso, Matisse, Chanel, Debussy, Stravinsky and Prokofiev, who were all at the forefront of Neoclassicism. Rather than turning away from his classical training, Balanchine built upon the traditional ballet vocabulary. He extended traditional ballet positions, played with speed and freedom of movement, and incorporated new positions not traditionally seen in ballet. Balanchine's first foray into the neoclassical style was Apollon Musegete, choreographed in 1928 for the Ballets Russes, and set to a score by Stravinsky. Unlike many of his later neoclassical works, this ballet tells a story, which indicates that Balanchine had not yet completely broken free from the Romantic tradition. Moreover, when this ballet first premiered it featured large sets, costumes and props. However, Balanchine continually revised it as his neoclassical style evolved. For example, later versions of the ballet utilized white practice leotards and minimal sets and lights. Balanchine even renamed the ballet simply Apollo. The transformation of Apollo exemplifies Balanchine‚Äôs transformation as a choreographer. As Balanchine‚Äôs neoclassical style matured, he produced more plotless, musically driven ballets. Large sets and traditional tutus gave way to clean stages and plain leotards. This simplified external style allowed for the dancers‚Äô movement to become the main artistic medium, which is the hallmark of neoclassical ballet. Balanchine found a home for his neoclassical style in the United States, when Lincoln Kirstein brought him to New York in 1933 to start a ballet company. He famously decided to start a school, where he could train dancers in the style he wanted, and so the School of American Ballet was founded in 1934. Many of his most famous neoclassical ballets were choreographed in the United States, on both his school eventually his own company, the New York City Ballet, which he founded in 1948 and still exists today. Well-known neoclassical ballets like Concerto Barocco, (1941), Four Temperaments, (1946), Agon, (1957), and Episodes, (1959) were all choreographed in New York. ==Significant choreographers and works== Although much of Balanchine's work epitomized the genre, some choreographers like the British Frederick Ashton and Kenneth MacMillan were also great neoclassical choreographers. *George Balanchine **Apollo (1928) **The Prodigal Son (1929) **Serenade (1934) **Concerto Barocco (1941) **Symphony in C (1947) **Agon (1957) **Jewels (1967) *Serge Lifar **Les Cr√©atures de Prom√©th√©e (1929) **Le Spectre de la rose (personal version) (1931) **L'Apr√®s-midi d'un faune (personal version) (1935) **Icare (1935) **Istar (1941) **Suite en Blanc (1943) *Frederick Ashton **Symphonic Variations (1946) **Cinderella (1948) **Sylvia (1952) **Romeo and Juliet (1956) **Ondine (1958) **La Fille Mal Gardee (1960) **The Dream (1964) *Roland Petit **Le jeune homme et la mort (1946) **Carmen (1949) **Notre-Dame de Paris (1965) **Proust, ou Les intermittences du coeur (1974) **Clavigo (1999) *Kenneth MacMillan **Romeo and Juliet (1965) **Anastasia (1967) **L'histoire de Manon (1974) *Jerome Robbins **Dances at a Gathering (1969) *John Cranko **Onegin (1965) **The Taming of the Shrew (1969) == Notes == Category:Ballet styles Category:Ballet terminology ","title":"Neoclassical ballet"},{"id":"819575","text":"Benny Peter Agbayani, Jr. (; born December 28, 1971) is an American retired professional baseball player. He attended Saint Louis School, Hawaii Pacific University and the Oregon Institute of Technology. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets, Colorado Rockies and Boston Red Sox and Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Chiba Lotte Marines. ==CareerMinor leagues=== He was originally drafted by the California Angels but did not sign. Agbayani was later drafted in the 30th round by the New York Mets on June 3, 1993. He became a local star at the Triple-A minor league team, the Norfolk Tides. He has since been part of the Boston Red Sox, Colorado Rockies, Cincinnati Reds, and Kansas City Royals organizations. He last played for the Chiba Lotte Marines in the Japanese Pacific League. ===New York Mets=== Agbayani made his major league debut with the New York Mets on June 17, 1998, as part of an 8th-inning double-switch in which he defensively replaced center fielder Butch Huskey during a 5-4 loss to the Montreal Expos. He made his first start and picked up his first big league hit on June 19. Agbayani led off the bottom of the first inning by singling to second base off Florida Marlins pitcher Brian Meadows. Agbayani at Shea Stadium His 11 home runs prior to the All Star break in 1999 was the second-most by a Mets rookie, behind Ron Swoboda (15, in 1965); Ike Davis also had 11 in 2010. Swoboda's record was subsequently annihilated by Peter Alonso in 2019. On August 12, 2000 while a member of the Mets, Agbayani was involved in a particularly memorable play. In the fourth inning, with the Mets leading 1-0, the Giants loaded the bases after a double, an error, and a hit batsman. With one out, Giants catcher Bobby Estalella hit a fly pop to Agbayani in left field. Agbayani, thinking that the catch made three outs, gave the ball to a child in the stands and began to trot toward the dugout. Upon realizing his mistake, Agbayani sprinted back to the stands, pulled the ball from the hands of the young fan he had given it to, and fired a throw toward home plate. Unfortunately for Agbayani, once the ball left the field, the play was dead, and all three runners were awarded two bases‚Äîcausing Jeff Kent and Ellis Burks to score, and the Giants to take the lead, 2-1. The Mets went on to win the game, 3-2, and Agbayani gave another ball to the fan who had given the previous one back. Agbayani is also fondly remembered by Mets fans for two clutch home runs hit during the 2000 season, earning him the nickname \\"Hawaiian Punch\\" (after the popular fruit drink). On March 30, his 11th inning grand slam against the Chicago Cubs gave the Mets their first win of the season, and a split in the two-game series the Mets and Cubs played in Tokyo, Japan. (It remained the only regular-season MLB grand slam ever hit in Japan until Domingo Santana hit a grand slam for the Seattle Mariners vs the Oakland Athletics on March 20, 2019.) Later that year, on October 7, he hit a game-winning home run in the 13th inning of Game 3 of the National League Division Series against Aaron Fultz of the Giants. Agbayani also drove in the winning run in the only game the Mets won in the 2000 World Series. ===Colorado Rockies=== On January 21, 2002, Agbayani was part of a 10-player, three-team trade between the Mets, Rockies and Milwaukee Brewers, that sent him from New York to Colorado. He struggled in 48 games with the Rockies, hitting .205 with four home runs and 19 RBI before he was placed on waivers in late August. ===Boston Red Sox=== The Boston Red Sox selected Agbayani off waivers from the Rockies on August 26, 2002, as the club made a drive for the playoffs. He played relatively well down the stretch, hitting .297 and driving in eight runs in 37 at-bats over 13 games with Boston. In his final MLB game, September 29, Agbayani went 1-for-4 with a walk and a strikeout as the Red Sox defeated the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Fenway Park. ===Nippon Professional Baseball=== On October 26, 2005, Agbayani and the Chiba Lotte Marines swept the Hanshin Tigers in 4 games during the Japan Series. This was the Marines' first title in 31 years. On November 13, 2005, they won the inaugural Asia Series after defeating the champions of South Korea, China, and Taiwan. They defeated the Samsung Lions in the championship and Agbayani was named MVP of the series. Agbayani's manager with Chiba Lotte was his manager with the Mets, Bobby Valentine. He retired following the 2009 season, his sixth in Japan. == Personal life == Agbayani and his wife Niela have three children; daughters Aleia and Ailana and son Bruin. Aleia currently attends UC Berkeley and plays for their softball team. Following his retirement, Agbayani was hired as an educational assistant at Mililani High School in Oahu in 2010.McCarron, Anthony (April 10, 2010) Former New York Mets OF Benny Agbayani coming up big once again New York Daily News.

He drew upon the collections of David Malo, Samuel Kamakau, and Abraham Fornander to popularize Hawaiian folklore in his Legends of Maui (1910), Legends of Old Honolulu (1915), Legends of Gods and Ghost-Gods (1915), Hawaiian Legends of Volcanoes (1916) and Hawaiian Historical Legends (1923). ==Biography== Rev. William D. Westervelt was born in Oberlin, Ohio. He graduated from Oberlin College in 1871 with a B.A. degree, and from Oberlin Theological Seminary in 1874 with a B.D. degree. Pastor of churches in Cleveland, Ohio and Colorado, he settled in Hawaii in 1899, marrying a missionary descendant, Caroline Dickinson Castle (1859‚Äì1941). After the Hawaiian Historical Society was re-formed, he served as the Corresponding Secretary starting in 1908. He would later serve as treasurer and president. Westervelt's interest in Hawaiian mythology was an avocation that led to numerous magazine and newspaper articles, many reprinted in his several collections. He is noted as one of Hawaii's foremost authorities on island folklore in the English language. His anthologies of Hawaiian myths, legends and folk tales are considered among the best of the English versions of a Hawaiian view of the sacred and profane.

After passing up a potential professional football career, he played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman from to for the Boston Red Sox. Born in Lynn, Massachusetts to Greek immigrants, Georgios Agganis and Georgia Papalimperis, Agganis first gained notice as a college football player at Boston University, becoming the first person in school history to be named All-American. He passed up a professional career with the Cleveland Browns in order to play his favorite sport, baseball, close to his hometown. Agganis was signed to a bonus baby contract, and after one season playing minor league baseball, Agganis became the starter at first base for the Red Sox. In 1955, Agganis became gravely ill early in the season and was hospitalized for two weeks for pneumonia. He rejoined the Red Sox for a single week before being rehospitalized with a viral infection. After showing some signs of recovery, Agganis died of a pulmonary embolism on June 27. Agganis' sudden death is considered one of the greatest tragedies to hit Boston's sporting community. ==Early life== Agganis' Greek immigrant family were from Longanikos, Sparta, Greece. He was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, to a large family which includes four brothers and two sisters. He was a star football and baseball player at Lynn Classical High School as well as a strong student, being named as \\"All-Scholastic\\" from the state of Massachusetts. == College career == Agganis enrolled at Boston University, where he became a starter, primarily at quarterback. After his sophomore season in 1949, when he set a school record by tossing fifteen touchdown passes, he entered the Marine Corps. Agganis played for the Camp Lejeune (N.C.) football and baseball teams. He received a dependency discharge from the Marines to support his mother and returned to college to play in 1951-52. Around the same time, Agganis was participating in summer baseball leagues in Augusta, Maine. Agganis became the school's first All-American in football and Boston coach Buff Donelli named Agganis the \\"greatest football player he ever coached\\". He also played basketball and baseball in the school. Agganis set another Boston University mark by passing for for the season and won the Bulger Lowe Award as New England's outstanding football player. Coach Paul Brown of the Cleveland Browns thought he could be the successor to Otto Graham and drafted the college junior in the first round of the 1952 NFL Draft, offering him a bonus of $25,000. Boston Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey outbid Brown, however, and signed Agganis to play Major League Baseball for the Red Sox as a first baseman for $35,000. At the time of his death, Agganis was spending his off-season at his alma mater as an assistant coach, tutoring Tom Gastall, another quarterback who decided to play professional baseball and died young. == Baseball career == Following his 1953 college graduation, Agganis played with Triple-A Louisville where he hit .281 with 23 home runs and 108 RBI. He made his major league debut on April 13, 1954. Agganis had a modest rookie campaign, although he did lead American League first basemen in assists and fielding percentage. He hit 11 home runs that year, with 57 RBI and a .251 batting average. ==Death== Pine Grove Cemetery in Lynn. In 1955, Agganis lost his starting position to rookie Norm Zauchin but regained his spot not long afterwards. On June 2, he was hospitalized with pneumonia after complaining of severe fever and chest pains. Though he rejoined the Red Sox ten days later and played two games against the Chicago White Sox, he fell ill again in Kansas City on June 5. He was diagnosed with a viral infection and was flown back to Sancta Maria Hospital in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where the doctor on duty stated that Agganis played too soon after his first illness, which was probably the reason for the second. The Red Sox placed him on the voluntary retired list until he recuperated, an early version of the disabled list. He began showing signs of improvement, but suffered a fatal pulmonary embolism on June 27, 1955. Baseball was in a state of shock upon hearing of Agganis' death. Red Sox general manager Joe Cronin told the Associated Press that everyone related to the Red Sox organization was \\"grieved and shocked\\", saying that Agganis was a \\"grand boy\\", while stating that the team would be wearing #6 black armbands to honor Agganis. American League president Will Harridge commented that his office was \\"saddened and shocked\\" by Agganis' death, while Red Sox owner Tom Yawkey stated that he was \\"stunned,\\" calling Agganis a \\"man of great character\\". Ten thousand mourners attended his wake, where his body lay in state at St. George's Greek Orthodox Church in his home city of Lynn. ==Legacy== Agganis was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1974. Gaffney Street, near the former site of Braves Field in Boston, was renamed Harry Agganis Way in 1995. Agganis Arena is a multipurpose sports facility at Boston University. The Harry Agganis Stadium located on Camp Lejeune was named in his honor. The Agganis Foundation has awarded more than $1.1 million in college scholarships to 780 student-athletes from Boston and the North Shore, including Lynn. Scholarships are awarded for academic and athletic achievement. The Foundation was started in 1955 by the Boston Red Sox and owner Thomas A. Yawkey, the (Lynn) Daily Item newspaper and Harold O. Zimman, a mentor of Agganis for whom the football field at Tufts University is named. ==See also== *Boston University athletics *List of baseball players who died during their careers ==References== ==External links== * *Agganis Arena page * Category:1929 births Category:1955 deaths Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Deaths from pulmonary embolism Category:American people of Greek descent Category:Major League Baseball first basemen Category:Baseball players from Massachusetts Category:Sportspeople from Lynn, Massachusetts Category:Sportspeople from Boston Category:Boston University Terriers baseball players Category:Boston University Terriers football players Category:Infectious disease deaths in Massachusetts Category:Deaths from pneumonia ","title":"Harry Agganis"},{"id":"819617","text":"Ghum may refer to: * Another spelling for the city Qom in Iran * Ghum, West Bengal, a small hilly locality in the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region of West Bengal, India ** Ghum Monastery, Buddhist * GHUM, the London-based post punk band ","title":"Ghum"},{"id":"819619","text":"Bloc Party are an English rock band, composed of Kele Okereke (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards, sampler), Russell Lissack (lead guitar, keyboards), Justin Harris (bass guitar, keyboards, saxophones, backing vocals) and Louise Bartle (drums, percussion). Former members Matt Tong and Gordon Moakes left the band in 2013 and 2015 respectively. Their brand of music, whilst rooted in rock, retains elements of other genres such as electronica and house music. The band was formed at the 1999 Reading Festival by Okereke and Lissack. They went through a variety of names before settling on Bloc Party in 2003. Moakes joined the band after answering an advert in NME magazine, while Tong was picked via an audition. Bloc Party got their break by giving BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq and Franz Ferdinand's lead singer, Alex Kapranos, a copy of their demo \\"She's Hearing Voices\\". In February 2005, the band released their debut album Silent Alarm. It was critically acclaimed and was named Indie Album of the Year at the 2006 PLUG Awards and NME Album of the year which both honour indie music. That year, the record was also certified platinum in Britain. The band built on this success in 2007 with the release of their second studio album, A Weekend in the City, which reached a peak of number two in the UK Albums Chart and number twelve in the Billboard 200. In August 2008, Bloc Party released their third studio record, Intimacy which entered the UK Albums Chart at number eight and number eighteen on the Billboard 200. The band went on a hiatus in October 2009 to focus on side projects. They reunited in September 2011, and shortly thereafter released their fourth album, Four, which entered the UK Albums Chart at number three. In 2013, Bloc Party released their third EP titled The Nextwave Sessions in August; the band then began an indefinite hiatus to continue with their respective side projects. The band's fifth studio album, Hymns, the first to involve Harris and Bartle, was released on 29 January 2016. Bloc Party have sold over 3 million albums worldwide. ==HistoryFormation and rising popularity (1999‚Äì2004)=== Russell Lissack and Kele Okereke first met in 1998 in London. Lissack had attended Bancroft's School, while Okereke attended Ilford County High School, then Trinity Catholic High School, Woodford Green for sixth form. They bumped into each other again in 1999 at Reading Festival and decided to form a band. Bassist Gordon Moakes joined after answering an advert in NME, and drummer Matt Tong joined after an audition. After going through a variety of names, such as Union, The Angel Range, and Diet, the band settled on Bloc Party in September 2003, a play on block party. The band has said that the name was not intended to be an allusion to the Soviet Bloc or the Canadian political party Bloc Qu√©b√©cois. However, Moakes said on the group's official Internet forum that it was more a merging of the eastern \\"Blocs\\" and the western \\"parties\\", in the political sense. He also notes that the name was not explicitly driven by politics, but rather it \\"looked, sounded, seemed fine so we went with it.\\" In November 2003, Bloc Party had their track \\"The Marshals Are Dead\\" featured on a compilation CD called The New Cross released by Angular Recording Corporation. They then released their debut single \\"She's Hearing Voices\\" on the then fledgling record label Trash Aesthetics. Also in 2003 Bloc Party personally mailed Steve Aoki a 7-inch of the track ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Hearing Voices‚Äù and signed to Dim Mak shortly thereafter. Dim Mak teamed up with VICE, a subsidiary of Atlantic Records, and entered a major label deal for the first time. Dim Mak and Atlantic later released Bloc Party's critically acclaimed and commercially successful Silent Alarm in 2005. The band got their break after Okereke went to a Franz Ferdinand concert in 2003, and gave a copy of \\"She's Hearing Voices\\" to both lead singer Alex Kapranos and BBC Radio 1 DJ Steve Lamacq. Lamacq subsequently played the song on his radio show, labelling the track \\"genius\\", and invited them to record a live session for the show. The buzz generated off the back of the single led to another release, \\"Banquet/Staying Fat\\", this time through Moshi Moshi Records, and to the eventual signing with independent label Wichita Recordings in April 2004. ===Silent Alarm (2004‚Äì2006)=== Bloc Party's Lissack and Okereke on stage in Cardiff in October 2005 Bloc Party's debut album, Silent Alarm, was released in February 2005 and was met with universal critical acclaim. It was voted 'Album of the Year' for 2005 by NME, and reached number 3 on the UK Albums Chart before being certified platinum. Note: Search for \\"Bloc Party\\". The first single from the album, \\"So Here We Are/Positive Tension\\", made the top 5 on the UK Top 40 chart. Further singles \\"Banquet\\" (which reached number 13 in NME's 'Top 50 Singles of 2005'), \\"Helicopter\\", and \\"Pioneers\\", whilst failing to repeat this success, still managed to reach the UK top 20. The animated video for \\"Pioneers,\\" made by the Shoreditch-based Minivegas design agency, was top of the NME video charts for four weeks. NME tagged them as \\"art-rock\\" at that time but the band felt it was too limited. The band received positive reviews from critics in the United States and they toured there heavily in the 18 months that followed the release of Silent Alarm. In early 2006, they finished their tour with sold-out shows in Los Angeles, Miami and Berkeley. The album went on to sell more than 350,000 copies in North America and over a million worldwide. After this success, the established electronic group, The Chemical Brothers, soon collaborated with Okereke for \\"Believe\\", a track on their Push the Button album. An album of remixes of tracks from Silent Alarm had also been released at the end of August 2005 in the UK. This remix album, entitled Silent Alarm Remixed, retained the album's original track list and includes remixes from the likes of Ladytron, M83, Death from Above 1979, Four Tet, and Mogwai. During July 2005, Bloc Party recorded two new tracks with Silent Alarm producer Paul Epworth. The songs were released as a single with a B-side, titled \\"Two More Years\\", to coincide with the band's October 2005 UK tour. The tour was also accompanied by a re-issue of Silent Alarm, which included \\"Two More Years\\" and former single \\"Little Thoughts\\" as bonus tracks. A remix of \\"Banquet\\" by The Streets, as well as a music video for the song, were included in the \\"Two More Years\\" single. Bloc Party also contributed the track \\"The Present\\" to the Help!: A Day in the Life compilation, the profits of which benefited the War Child charity. ===A Weekend in the City (2006‚Äì2008)=== Bloc Party's second album, A Weekend in the City, was produced by Garret \\"Jacknife\\" Lee. It was released in February 2007, although it was leaked in November 2006. It became available for download on the UK iTunes Store before the physical release, and reached the number 2 spot on the UK Albums Chart. The album also reached number 2 on the Australian and Belgian charts, and debuted at number 12 in the Billboard 200, with 48,000 copies sold. The first single, \\"The Prayer\\", was released on 29 January, and became the band's highest charting single in the British Top 40, reaching number 4.

In October 2007, it was announced that Bloc Party would release a new single, \\"Flux\\", on 13 November‚Äîahead of their end of year gigs. The electronic song, also produced by Jacknife Lee, was very different from previous singles released by the band. The band's first gig following the release of A Weekend in the City was on 5 February 2007, in Reading, and was broadcast live on BBC 6 Music. On 20 May 2007, Bloc Party headlined on the In New Music We Trust stage at the BBC Radio 1 Big Weekend in Preston. They also performed at the UK leg of Live Earth on 7 July 2007 at Wembley Stadium.

An album of remixes of all tracks on Intimacy, Intimacy Remixed, was released in May 2009. The band undertook their first UK tour since December 2007 in October 2009, dubbing it \\"Bloctober\\". ===One More Chance and hiatus (2009‚Äì2011)=== In July 2009, Okereke stated that the band did not have a current recording contract and had no obligation or pressure to release a new album in the foreseeable future; he went on to suggest that the release of a fourth album was on an indefinite timescale. A new single, \\"One More Chance\\", was released in August 2009. The song did not appear on Intimacy and was produced by Jacknife Lee. After this, the group went on a hiatus, with the members unsure as to whether they would carry on. During this period of hiatus Lissack revived his project Pin Me Down and joined the live line-up of Irish rock-band Ash as guitarist and synthesiser player on their touring for the A‚ÄìZ Series.Bloc Party's Russell Lissack to join Ash for UK tour NME, 16 March 2010 Moakes formed the group Young Legionnaire with Paul Mullen, vocalist & guitarist of The Automatic, and William Bowerman, drummer for La Roux, releasing a single, \\"Colossus\\" in August 2010. Okereke released a solo album, The Boxer, in June 2010. Produced by Hudson Mohawke and XXXChange, its release was preceded by the single \\"Tenderoni\\". Rumours throughout 2011 suggested Okereke had left the group to focus on solo work, though these were denied by other band members. ===Four and The Nextwave Sessions (2011‚Äì2013) === Bloc Party performing songs from Four at HARD Summer 2012. Bloc Party started writing material for a fourth album in 2011, but decided not to play live. In the meantime Okereke finished an EP titled The Hunter. The group stated they intended to release a new album in 2012. In May 2012, Bloc Party announced Four, which was released on 20 August 2012, after being made available to stream in its entirety for over a week preceding release. The album was recorded with Alex Newport, who had previously worked with At The Drive In and The Mars Volta, in New York City. Bloc Party released \\"Octopus\\" that July and later released another single entitled \\"Day Four\\". The band released \\"Kettling\\" on 12 November 2012, followed by \\"Truth\\" on 25 February 2013. Four peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and at number 36 on the Billboard 200.

Lissack later confirmed the band's plans to release a new EP in \\"northern hemisphere summer\\". He told Marc Zanotti of Australian website MusicFeeds that the new material was \\"not like a continuation of the record we've just made, it's a completely separate thing [...] the next step; the next progression\\". \\"French Exit\\" was given its debut live performance at Crystal Ballroom on 24 May. Some of the new material would feature on The Nextwave Sessions, an EP announced on 25 June and for release on 12 August via Frenchkiss Records. === Hiatus and line-up changes (2013‚Äì2015) === During the summer tour of 2013, drummer Matt Tong left the band. Lissack told a Canadian newspaper, the National Post that the band were planning to take an indefinite hiatus following their appearance at the Latitude Festival on 19 July. In October 2013, Kele assembled a DJ Mix for !K7's Tapes mix series, released under the Bloc Party name. In September 2014, Okereke stated that Bloc Party were working on a fifth album. In March 2015, bassist Gordon Moakes tweeted he had parted ways with Bloc Party. Following the departure of their former members, Okereke and Lissack started to work on new songs on their own in late 2014. Bloc Party unveiled their new line-up at two intimate gigs in the Los Angeles area (19 August 2015 at The Glass House in Pomona and 20 August 2015 at The Roxy in Los Angeles). Following these performances, Bloc Party also subheadlined FYF Fest in Los Angeles on 22 August 2015. At these shows, the band confirmed that they've finished recording their next album. The shows marked the live debut for new bassist Justin Harris of the Portland, Oregon, indie rock outfit Menomena, who had previously opened several Bloc Party U.S. tour dates in April 2009; and Louise Bartle, who was accidentally announced a month earlier as Bloc Party's drummer by instrument manufacturer Natal Drums in a since-deleted tweet, leading to fan speculation regarding her membership that was ultimately proved correct. These shows also included the first performances of two new songs called \\"Eden\\" and \\"Exes\\" according to the setlist. ===Hymns and Silent Alarm Live (2015‚Äì2019)=== In a performance at Maida Vale, Bloc Party gave \\"The Good News\\" its live debut; hours later, \\"The Love Within\\" was featured as \\"Hottest Record in the World\\" by Annie Mac on BBC Radio 1. Okereke revealed the band's upcoming fifth album is set to be titled Hymns. The album's release was later confirmed on social media as 29 January 2016. Later in 2016, the band released the standalone single 'Stunt Queen' to mark their performance at the Hollywood Bowl, which Okereke claimed was a \\"significant milestone\\" for the band. It marks some of the first new material that featured Justin and Louise as co- writers. March 2018 saw the band announce a series of shows touring their 'Silent Alarm' album which would be played in full. Due to the success of this short tour, Bloc Party announced further dates in 2019 again playing tracks from the whole of their debut. ===Untitled new album (2020‚Äìpresent)=== On 22 January 2020, Okereke announced on his personal social media accounts that Bloc Party had begun writing a new album. ==Musical style== Kele Okereke Bloc Party's musical style has been described as indie rock, post-punk revival, post-Britpop,I. Collinson, \\"Devopop: pop Englishness and post-Britpop guitar bands\\", in A. Bennett and J. Stratton, eds, Britpop and the English Music Tradition (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2010), , pp. 163‚Äì178. alternative rock, art punk, art rock, dance-rock, and alternative dance. Bloc Party's brand of guitar rock draws on influences such as The Chemical Brothers, Pixies, Joy Division, Sonic Youth and The Smiths. Okereke has also stated that Mogwai's album Mogwai Young Team changed his life by being his musical \\"year zero\\". Okereke also cites Suede as a major influence, he says Dog Man Star was the first record he fell in love with.Hanman, Natalie. \\"Portrait of the artist\\". The Guardian. 10 April 2007 Particular parallels were made between Bloc Party and Gang of Four upon their arrival on the music scene, yet the band were \\"mildly infuriated\\" at such references, claiming they had never \\"particularly liked\\" Gang of Four. To achieve their unique style, numerous delay and other effects pedals are implemented. During the recording of second album A Weekend in the City, the band suggested it would contain \\"some truly R&B; styled beats, a song where [Tong] and [Moakes] play drums simultaneously [with] both eggshell-thin fragility and trouser-flapping hugeness\\", as opposed to their typical sound. The style has been compared to and inspired by such bands as Radiohead, U2, Depeche Mode, and Bj√∂rk. Some of the most noticeable changes between debut Silent Alarm and A Weekend in the City are that the songs became more layered and less raw due to inclusion of string arrangements. With the release of \\"Flux\\", Bloc Party's style became even more diverse with the inclusion of electronic music. \\"Mercury\\" saw Bloc Party distance themselves even further from the traditional guitar band set-up by experimenting with dark electronic sounds and a brass section inspired by Siouxsie and the Banshees. The band's third album Intimacy also features synths, processed drum beats and loops, vocal manipulation, and choral arrangements. Even though the album was influenced by electronic music, the band still had not lost their feel for guitar music. For example, in an interview, Okereke said that the band was starting to miss their more traditional sound, and confirmed that may have been the way fourth album was headed. However, Tong contradicted this, stating: \\"There's every chance we might go back to more orthodox arrangements or things that resemble a traditional band but I don't think we'll ever write songs like we did on Silent Alarm again.\\" A 2009 Vice Records mix lists the following songs Bloc Party are influenced by: Eagle Boston's \\"Wild Wild Ost\\", Pylon's \\"Working Is No Problem\\", Delta 5's \\"Mind Your Own Business\\", John Foxx's \\"Underpass\\", Prince's \\"I Would Die 4 U\\" (also covered live), Sonic Youth's \\"Youth Against Fascism\\", Dinosaur Jr.'s \\"Freak Scene\\", La Roux's \\"Quicksand (Nightrunners Edit)\\", and Bruce Springsteen's \\"57 Channels (And Nothin' On)\\". ==Members== Current * Kele Okereke ‚Äì lead vocals, rhythm guitar, sampler, electric piano (1999‚Äìpresent) * Russell Lissack ‚Äì lead guitar, sampler, synthesiser, programming (1999‚Äìpresent) * Justin Harris ‚Äì bass guitar, backing vocals, synthesiser, glockenspiel, saxophone (2015‚Äìpresent) * Louise Bartle ‚Äì drums, percussion, backing vocals (2015‚Äìpresent) Former * Gordon Moakes ‚Äì bass guitar, backing vocals, occasional lead vocals, keyboards, synthesiser, drums, glockenspiel (2002‚Äì2015) * Matt Tong ‚Äì drums, percussion, backing vocals (2002‚Äì2013) Former touring * Sarah Jones - drums, percussion (2013) Timeline ==Discography== Studio albums * Silent Alarm (2005) * A Weekend in the City (2007) * Intimacy (2008) * Four (2012) * Hymns (2016) ==Awards and nominations== Bloc Party have had several nominations from a number of different awarding bodies during their recording career.

There are no other mentions of the name anywhere else in the Bible. ==HHaahashtari=== Haahashtari or Ahashtari was one of the sons of Naarah, one of the two wives of Asshur (1 Chronicles 4:6).

According to Cheyne and Black, the presence of this clan name in the genealogies of Reuben and Midian may indicate that the clan Hanoch was considered a part of the Tribe of Reuben but had a Midianite origin. === Haran === Haran or Aran refers to three minor characters in the Hebrew Bible: # Haran ( ‚Äì HƒÅrƒÅn), son of Terah, from Ur of the Chaldees.

Because the name often appears in lists without any detailed description, it is sometimes difficult to tell whether different verses that use the name are referring to the same Hashabiah or to distinct persons. The following list of nine individuals is the number listed in the Encyclopaedia Biblica, although the encyclopedia does not claim that precisely nine people of this name are mentioned: # A Levite of the Merarite group, mentioned 1 Chronicles 6:45 (verse 30 in some Bibles). # Hashabiah son of Bunni, a Merarite Levite listed as living in Jerusalem in 1 Chronicles 9:14 and Nehemiah 11:15. # A leader of a large group of people in the time of David.1 Chronicles 26:30 # A musician, one of the musicians appointed by David for the musical service of the Temple.1 Chronicles 25:3, 19 # Hashabiah son of Kemuel, identified as the leader of the Levites in the time of David.1 Chronicles 27:17 # A Levite leader in the time of Josiah.2 Chronicles 35:9 # A Levite identified as having signed the covenant between Ezra and God.Ezra 8:19 # A ruler listed as one of the people responsible for repairing the wall of Jerusalem in Nehemiah 3:17. # The ruler of the clan of Hilkiah, according to Nehemiah 12:21. === Hashabnah === Hashabnah is the name given for one of the men who signed the covenant between the people of Judah and God in Nehemiah 10:25 (verse 26 in some Bibles).

According to the Encyclopaedia Biblica, it should most likely be given alternate vowels as Holdai or Huldai. # Heldai son of Baanah the Netophathite is listed as one of David's Mighty Warriors, and also in a list of military leaders given in 1 Chronicles 27:15. He is called \\"Heled\\" in 1 Chronicles 11:30, and \\"Heleb\\" in 2 Samuel 23:29. # A Jew living in Babylonia, mentioned in Zechariah 6:10.

Binnui reappears later, where he is described as a Levite and as one of the signatories of the covenant between Ezra, God, and the people of Judah.Nehemiah 10:9 The \\"sons of Henadad,\\" though without any specific individuals named, are mentioned in also in Ezra 3:9, a \\"difficult passage\\". ===Hepher=== Hepher was a son of Manasseh according to Numbers 26:32 and Joshua 17:2. See List of minor biblical places ¬ß Hepher. ===Hezekiah=== This section is about the minor biblical figures named Hezekiah. For the king Hezekiah, see Hezekiah. Hezekiah is the name of three minor figures in the Hebrew Bible. In some Bibles the variant spellings Hizkiah and Hizkijah occur. * A son of Neariah and descendant of David mentioned in the royal genealogy of 1 Chronicles 3.Verse 22. * A figure mentioned in passing in Ezra 2:16 and Nehemiah 7:21, as the ancestor of some of the exiles who returned from the Babylonian captivity. * An ancestor of the prophet Zephaniah.Zephaniah 1:1 ===Hezron=== Hezron or Hetzron () is the name of two men in Genesis. * In , Hezron is a son of Reuben and the founder of the Hezronites. * In , Hezron is grandson of Judah and the son of Pharez. ===Hiel=== Hiel the Bethelite (Heb. ◊ê÷≤◊ó÷¥◊ô◊ê÷µ◊ú, ◊ó÷¥◊ô◊ê÷µ◊ú; \\"the [divine] brother, or kinsman, is God\\")) rebuilt Jericho during the reign of King Ahab.

The relevant part of Numbers 10:29 reads: \\"And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law\\". Reuel (or Raguel) and Jethro were different persons from different narratives of the same events (the Bible isn't coherent). That of Judges 4:11 reads: \\"Now Heber the Kenite had severed himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses\\". Moses invited Hobab to take part in the Exodus journey into the Promised Land, wanting to make use of his local knowledge, but Hobab preferred to return home to Midian (). Briefly, Hobab, Reuel/Raguel, and Jethro were all Moses' father-in-law. === Hod === Hod is a biblical name which appears only in 1 Chronicles 7:37.

It is a shortened version of the name \\"Jehoshama.\\" === Hotham === Hotham is the name for two individuals found in the BIble.

In a passage in which Nahum is predicting the fall of Nineveh, the prophet says, \\"Huzzab shall be led away captive\\" in the King James Version. However, a number of more contemporary versions since the late nineteenth century have interpreted the word as a verb, meaning \\"and it has been decreed.\\"See also the New International Version and New Living Translation. ==I Ibhar === Ibhar was one of the sons of David. The name Ibhar means \\"Chosen\\".2 Samuel 5:151 Chronicles 3:6 === Ibneiah === Ibneiah is the name given in Chronicles to a leader of a clan in the Tribe of Benjamin which returned to Yehud Medinata after the Babylonian captivity.1 Chronicles 9:8 The same character is referred to as \\"Gabbai\\" in the parallel passage in Nehemiah.Nehemiah 11:8 === Ibnijah === Ibnijah is a figure who is mentioned indirectly in 1 Chronicles 9:8, by way of his descendant \\"Meshullam, son of Shephatiah, son of Reuel, son of Ibnijah.\\" He was a Benjamite. === Ibsam === According to Chronicles, Ibsam was the son of Tola, who in turn was the son of Issachar.1 Chronicles 7:2 He is called Jibsam in the King James Version. === Idbash === Idbash, according to 1 Chronicles 4:3, was one of the sons of Etham, a figure who appears in the Chronicler's genealogy of the Tribe of Judah. ===Igal=== Igal is the name of three biblical figures. * Igal son of Joseph of Issachar, a scout sent to Canaan prior to the crossing of the Jordan River according to Numbers 13:7. * Igal son of Nathan of Zobah is mentioned only in 2 Samuel 23:36 in a list of David's Mighty Warriors. * Igal son of Shemaiah is listed as a descendant of Zerubbabel in 1 Chronicles 3:22.

In the Masoretic Text as it now stands, Iram is identified as a \\"tribal leader\\" (Hebrew alluph) of Edom.

Qere is the term for the version of the text traditionally read aloud in synagogues. The Ketiv, the version written but not read aloud, reads somewhat differently, in a manner that suggested to Thomas Kelly Cheyne that the opening words of the verse were not the name of the giant, but words that indicated that David and his soldiers stayed in (the city of) Nob. Whatever the case with the Ketiv, the Qere as it now stands asserts that Ishbi-benob was the name of a Philistine giant, who was killed by Abishai son of Zeruiah.2 Samuel 21:16‚Äì17 Gesenius interprets his name as meaning \\"dweller upon the height\\".Pulpit Commentary on 2 Samuel 21, accessed 19 August 2017 In Brenton's Septuagint Translation, his name is given as Jesbi, the progeny of Rapha.Brenton's Septuagint Translation, 2 Samuel 21:16 === Ishhod === Ishhod (King James Version Ishod) is a figure mentioned only once in the Hebrew Bible. 1 Chronicles 7:18 lists Ishod as a son of Hammoleketh in a genealogy of the Tribe of Manasseh. === Ishiah === See Jesiah. === Ishijah === See Jesiah. === Ishmaiah === Ishmaiah (KJV Ismaiah) is the name of two biblical figures. * Ishmaiah son of Obadiah was the leader of the Tribe of Zebulun in the time of David, according to 1 Chronicles 27:19.

Albright, the \\"definitive solution\\" to the problem is that the text should read mlk rb or mlky rb, meaning \\"the great king\\", a Hebrew translation of the common Assyrian royal title sharru rabu. The proposed emendation to \\"great king\\" has been accepted in a number of biblical translations.For example, NIV, NLT, ESV, Holman, and NET === Jaresiah === See Jaareshiah. ===Jarha=== Jarha was an Egyptian slave of Sheshan who was married to Sheshan's daughter according to 1 Chronicles 2:34‚Äì35. === Jarah === See Jehoaddah. === Jasiel === See Jaasiel. === Jathniel === Jathniel is a minor biblical figure who appears only in 1 Chronicles 26:2, in a list of Korahite porters. === Jaziz === Jaziz the Hagrite, according to 1 Chronicles 27:31, was in charge of king David's flocks of sheep and goats. === Jeatherai === See Ethni. === Jecamiah === See Jekamiah. ===Jecholiah=== Jecholiah (Hebrew: ◊ô◊õ◊ú◊ô◊î◊ï, yekhalyahu) of Jerusalem was the wife of the King of Judah, Amaziah, and the mother of King Azariah.2 Kings 15:2 Depending on translation used, her name may also be spelled Jechiliah, Jecoliah, or Jekoliah.

Hinduism in South America is found in several countries, but is strongest in the Indo-Caribbean populations of Guyana and Suriname. There are about 550,000 Hindus in South America, chiefly the descendants of Indian indentured laborers in the Guianas. There are about 270,000 Hindus in Guyana, 120,000 in Suriname, and some others in French Guiana. In Guyana and Suriname, Hindus form the second largest religion and in some regions and districts, Hindus forms the majority. ==Hinduism in Argentina== Argentina has 2,030 persons of Indian origin (PIOs) and 1,300 non- resident Indians (NRIs). Some of them still refer to ayurveda, practice yoga, enjoy Indian classical music and speak the Hindi language. They have established an Indian Association in the northern provinces and organise social and cultural events to celebrate Indian festivals. Unfortunately, there is little interaction between them and those who have settled down in other parts of the extensive country. A large number of the Indian diaspora living in Buenos Aires are businessmen, doctors, financial or business executives and employees of multinational corporations. Most of them have retained their Indian citizenship. Many Hindus are Indo-Caribbeans from Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Suriname. ==Hinduism in Brazil== According to the 2011 census, there are about 9500 Hindus in brazil constituting 0.005% of the population of brazil. Most of the Brazilian Hindus are ethnic East Indians. However, there are new converts due to the missionary effects of Hare Krishnas. A small number of Sindhis that arrived from Suriname and Central America in 1960 to set up shop as traders in the city of Manaus is considered to be the first wave of immigration. The second wave consisted of university professors who arrived in the 1960s and also in the 1970s. ==Hinduism in Chile== A few Indians had gone to Chile in the 1920s. The others migrated there about 30 years ago -- not only from India, but also from Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Nigeria, Panama, the Philippines and Singapore. The Hindu Community in Chile comprises more than 1400 members. Among these ,400 people (90 families) lives in the Capital city Santiago. Most of the Hindus in Chile are Sindhis. There is a Hindu Temple in Punta Arenas which provide services in both Sindhi and Spanish. Besides Punta Arenas, the Indian business community is also present in Santiago, the capital of Chile, and Iquique. The activities of businessmen in Santiago are mainly confined to imports and retail stores. Source *Hindus in Chile * Indian Diaspora in South America ==Hinduism in Colombia== Hinduism in Colombia was mainly introduced with the arrival of Indians, especially Indian migrant workers from Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname. There are ISKCON (The Hare-Krishnas) centers in the capital, Bogota.http://news.iskcon.org/node/3365 ==Hinduism in French Guiana== Most of the Hindus in French Guiana are of Surinamese origin. According to the 2000 census 1.6% of the total population (3,200 out of 202,000) were Hindu. ==Hinduism in Guyana== Central Vaidik Mandir in Georgetown About 84% of the East Indian immigrants were Hindu. During the indenture period, the East Indian caste system broke down. Hinduism was redefined, and caste-distinguishing practices were eliminated. Christian missionaries attempted to convert East Indians during the indenture period, beginning in 1852, but met with little success. The missionaries blamed the Brahmins for their failure: the Brahmins began administering spiritual rites to all Hindus regardless of caste once the Christian missionaries started proselytizing in the villages, hastening the breakdown of the caste system. After the 1930s, Hindu conversions to Christianity slowed because the status of Hinduism improved and the discrimination against Hindus diminished. In areas where there are large percentage of Indo Guyanese residing together ‚Äî Mandirs of various sizes can be found, according to the population. All main Hindu occasions are observed ‚Äî Basant Panchami in January to Gita Jayanti in December. Since the late 1940s, reform movements caught the attention of many Guyanese Hindus. The most important, the Arya Samaj movement, arrived in Guyana in 1910. Arya Samaj doctrine rejects the idea of caste and the exclusive role of Brahmins as religious leaders. The movement preaches monotheism and opposition to the use of images in worship as well as many traditional Hindu rituals. The Arya Samajis often did not get along with the SanƒÅtanƒ´s (orthodox Hindus), but today many have put those differences aside. Approximately between 216,000 and 230,000 identified themselves as Hindus in the 2002 census. ==Hinduism in Paraguay== In the 2002 census, it was estimated that about 551 Hindus live in Paraguay. They make up 0.01% of Paraguay's population. Paraguay's ambassador to India, Mr Pappalardo, gave Punjab farmers a high opportunity to invest the country.Paraguay's agreement with India Most of the Hindus live in Asunci√≥n. ==Hinduism in Peru== The first ‚ÄòIndian Indians‚Äô to have arrived in Peru were businessmen who had gone there in the early 1960s. Later on, the community grew in number marginally until the early 80s, after which many of its members left due to the severe local economic crises and the prevailing terrorism. Those with relatives in other Latin countries joined them. In the recent past, the size of the community has remained stable. There is a small remnant of the original ‚Äònative Indians‚Äô in this country who still maintain their traditional culture and religious beliefs. Most members of the local Indian community are Sindhis. They are reasonably well-off, but very few can be regarded as prosperous. Their general level of education is low. Most of them speak only their mother tongue and Spanish, with a smattering of English. There is also here a small number of professionals from other parts of India. Residence permits are not difficult to obtain in Peru. But citizenship is more complicated and only a small number of Indians have obtained it ‚Äì not more than 10 out of a total number of almost forty persons. While a few cultural activities are organized by the more enterprising PIOs, in general they maintain a low profile. Considering the vast distance that separates the community from India, its interest in its country of origin is limited to major events, mainly derived from occasional browsing on the internet. But being invariably first generation migrants, many of them do occasionally visit India. ==Hinduism in Suriname== Arya Dewaker Hindu temple in Paramaribo. The story of Hinduism in Suriname is broadly parallel to that in Guyana. Indian indentured labourers were sent to colonial Dutch Guiana by special arrangement between the Dutch and British. The difference is that the Netherlands' more liberal policy toward Hinduism allowed the culture to develop stronger. Examples are the lack of a rigid caste system and the almost universal reading of Gita and Ramayan. According to the 2012 census of Suriname, Hindus constitute 22.3% of the population.2012 Suriname Census Definitive Results . Algemeen Bureau voor de Statistiek - Suriname. Hindus are mostly concentrated in Northern coastal regions of Suriname: Nickerie, Wanica and Saramacca, where they constitute the largest religious group. There are several Hindu temples in Suriname. ==Hinduism in Uruguay== There are a few Yoga organizations in Uruguay, which spread Indian thought and philosophy-prominent among them are, Sivapremananda Ashram of the Divine Society. A portion of the beach in Montevideo has been named after Mahatma Gandhi and a bust of Gandhiji installed in one of the parks along the beach. There is a school named after him in Montevideo, a street and another school named after Republic of India. There is a small Indian community in Uruguay consisting of 300 members approx. == Hinduism in Venezuela== During the oil-related high-income years of the 1970s, there were around 400 NRIs in this country. There are also several thousand of Indo-Caribbeans from Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, and Guyana in the cities of Ciudad Guayana and Caracas. The Indian community consisted of personnel from the petroleum and petrochemical sectors, as well as a large number of traders. Many of them had taken their families with them to Venezuela, whether from India or elsewhere. Most of the traders belonged to the Sindhi community but there were also some persons from Gujarat, Punjab and the southern Indian States. When the oil boom ended in 1982, followed by devaluation of the local currency, many of the NRIs decided to seek their fortunes elsewhere. Currently, the Diaspora has been whittled down to half its former size. There are now only about 45 Indian families in Venezuela who are mainly engaged in retail trade. There are also a small number of experts in high tech. industries such as telecommunications. All of them have adapted themselves very well to their country of residence and are generally held in high regard by the local people on account of their hard work, expertise and non-political nature. The Venezuelan Constitution guarantees equal rights without discrimination to all expatriate personnel. This has facilitated the Indian community‚Äôs life. Another interesting feature is that many local persons are interested in Indian religions and spirituality. Some members of the Indian community also attend their functions. Most of the NRIs are well educated. However, given their small numbers, they have not formed themselves into an active representative body. But they remain in touch with one another and with the Indian Embassy in Caracas. Even though they have little time to engage in numerous cultural activities, they do get together to celebrate Indian festivals like Diwali. On the whole, the Indian community in Venezuela is quite prosperous and has a per capita income that is above the national average that is itself as high as US$8,300 in terms of PPP. They take an active part in mobilising donations to help in alleviating distress at times of national calamities in India.

The field can be broadly divided into a classical period and a contemporary one, known as \\"New economic sociology\\". The classical period was concerned particularly with modernity and its constituent aspects, including rationalisation, secularisation, urbanisation, and social stratification. As sociology arose primarily as a reaction to capitalist modernity, economics played a role in much classic sociological inquiry. The specific term \\"economic sociology\\" was first coined by William Stanley Jevons in 1879, later to be used in the works of √âmile Durkheim, Max Weber and Georg Simmel between 1890 and 1920. Weber's work regarding the relationship between economics and religion and the cultural \\"disenchantment\\" of the modern West is perhaps most iconic of the approach set forth in the classic period of economic sociology. Contemporary economic sociology may include studies of all modern social aspects of economic phenomena; economic sociology may thus be considered a field in the intersection of economics and sociology. Frequent areas of inquiry in contemporary economic sociology include the social consequences of economic exchanges, the social meanings they involve and the social interactions they facilitate or obstruct. ==Classical== Economic sociology arose as a new approach to the analysis of economic phenomena; emphasizing particularly the role of economic structures and institutions that play upon society, and the influence a society holds over the nature of economic structures and institutions. The relationship between capitalism and modernity is a salient issue, perhaps best demonstrated in Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905) and Simmel's The Philosophy of Money (1900). Economic sociology may be said to have begun with Tocqueville's Democracy in America (1835‚Äì40) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). Marx's historical materialism would attempt to demonstrate how economic forces influence the structure of society on a fundamental level. √âmile Durkheim's The Division of Labour in Society was published in 1922, whilst Max Weber's Economy and Society was released in the same year. ==Contemporary== Contemporary economic sociology focuses particularly on the social consequences of economic exchanges, the social meanings they involve and the social interactions they facilitate or obstruct. Influential figures in modern economic sociology include Fred L. Block, James S. Coleman, Paula England, Mark Granovetter, Harrison White, Paul DiMaggio, Joel M. Podolny, Lynette Spillman, Richard Swedberg and Viviana Zelizer in the United States, as well as Carlo Trigilia, Donald Angus MacKenzie, Laurent Th√©venot and Jens Beckert in Europe. To this may be added Amitai Etzioni, who has developed the idea of socioeconomics, and Chuck Sabel, Wolfgang Streeck and Michael Mousseau who work in the tradition of political economy/sociology. The focus on mathematical analysis and utility maximisation during the 20th century has led some to see economics as a discipline moving away from its roots in the social sciences. Many critiques of economics or economic policy begin from the accusation that abstract modelling is missing some key social phenomenon that needs to be addressed. Economic sociology is an attempt by sociologists to redefine in sociological terms questions traditionally addressed by economists. It is thus also an answer to attempts by economists (such as Gary Becker) to bring economic approaches ‚Äì in particular utility maximisation and game theory ‚Äì to the analysis of social situations that are not obviously related to production or trade. Karl Polanyi, in his book The Great Transformation, was the first theorist to propose the idea of \\"embeddedness\\", meaning that the economy is \\"embedded\\" in social institutions which are vital so that the market does not destroy other aspects of human life. The concept of \\"embeddedness\\" serves sociologists who study technological developments. Mark Granovetter and Patrick McGuire mapped the social networks which determined the economics of the electrical industry in the United States. Ronen Shamir analyzed how electrification in Mandatory Palestine facilitated the creation of an ethnic-based dual-economy. Polanyi's form of market skepticism, however, has been criticized for intensifying rather than limiting the economization of society. ===New economic sociology=== A contemporary period of economic sociology, often known as new economic sociology, was consolidated by the 1985 work of Mark Granovetter titled \\"Economic Action and Social Structure: The Problem of Embeddedness\\". These works elaborated the concept of embeddedness, which states that economic relations between individuals or firms take place within existing social relations (and are thus structured by these relations as well as the greater social structures of which those relations are a part). Social network analysis has been the primary methodology for studying this phenomenon. Granovetter's theory of the strength of weak ties and Ronald Burt's concept of structural holes are two best known theoretical contributions of this field. ==Marxist sociology== Modern Marxist thought has focused on the social implications of capitalism (or \\"commodity fetishism\\") and economic development within the system of economic relations that produce them. Important theorists include Georg Luk√°cs, Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, Guy Debord, Louis Althusser, Nicos Poulantzas, Ralph Miliband, J√ºrgen Habermas, Raymond Williams, Fredric Jameson, Antonio Negri, and Stuart Hall. ==Socioeconomics== Economic sociology is sometimes synonymous with socioeconomics. Socioeconomics deals with the analytical, political and moral questions arising at the intersection between economy and society from a broad interdisciplinary perspective with links beyond sociology to political economy, moral philosophy, institutional economics and history. ==Academic associations== The Society for the Advancement of Socio-Economics (SASE) is an international academic association whose members are involved in social studies of economy and economic processes. The Socio-Economic Review was established as the official journal of SASE in 2003. The journal aims to encourage work on the relationship between society, economy, institutions and markets, moral commitments and the rational pursuit of self-interest. Most articles focus on economic action in its social and historical context, drawing from sociology, political science, economics and the management and policy sciences. According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2015 impact factor of 1.926, ranking it 56th out of 344 journals in the category \\"Economics\\", 21st out of 163 journals in the category \\"Political Science\\" and 19th out of 142 journals in the category \\"Sociology\\". The American Sociological Association's Economic Sociology section became a permanent Section in January 2001. According to its website, it has about 800 members. Another group of scholars in this area works as Research Committee in Economy and Society (RC02) within the International Sociological Association. Economic Sociology and Political Economy (ES/PE), founded in 2011, is an online scholarly society that gathers researchers interested in economic sociology and related topics. ==See also== * Behavioral economics * Cultural economics * Economic anthropology * Economics empiricism * Industrial sociology * Political economy ==Notes== ==References== * Gary S.

His pin-up art appeared primarily in Esquire and Fawcett Publications's True but was also in calendars marketed by Esquire, True and Ridgid Tool Company. Petty's Esquire gatefolds originated and popularized the magazine device of centerfold spreads. Reproductions of his work, known as \\"Petty Girls,\\" were widely rendered by military artists as nose art decorating warplanes during the Second World War, including the Memphis Belle. == Birth and early career== George Petty was born in Abbeville, the seat of Vermilion Parish in south Louisiana to George Brown Petty III and his wife, Sarah. George, IV, was the couple's second child; his sister Elizabeth had been born in 1891. The Petty family moved to Chicago, Illinois, just before the turn of the century, where George, III, a photographer of some note, enjoyed considerable success with images of young women, madonnas, and nudes. Petty was not a particularly good student in high school, spending a great deal of time on extracurricular activities instead of schoolwork. His artistic bent first became obvious in high school, where he was the staff artist for the school newspaper. During his high school years, he enrolled in evening classes at Chicago Academy of Fine Arts under the tutoring of Ruth VanSickle Ford, where he taught his own art course, charging classmates $5.00 per session. He also worked in his father's photo shop where he learned how to use an airbrush. In Paris, Petty studied art at the Acad√©mie Julian with Jean- Paul Laurens and others until 1916, when World War I caused Myron T. Herrick, ambassador at that time, to order all Americans to return home. Petty returned to Chicago, and worked as an airbrush retoucher for a local printing company. He was able to establish himself as a freelance artist, painting calendar girls and magazine covers for The Household. By 1926, he was able to open his own studio. == Artistic influences == George Petty never discussed in detail those artists who influenced him, other than J. C. Leyendecker (an artist for The Saturday Evening Post during George's high school days) for his interpretation of men, Coles Phillips for his technique, and Maxfield Parrish for his use of light. However, it can be inferred from his later work that other influences included artists who were extremely popular in Paris at the time, such as Alfons Mucha, George Barbier and, in particular, the watercolor technique of England's William Russell Flint. == \\"The Petty Girl\\" == Petty is especially known for \\"the Petty Girl\\", a series of pin-up paintings of women done for Esquire from the autumn of 1933 until 1956. Petty frequently depicted these women with the relative lengths of their legs being longer‚Äîand the relative sizes of their heads being smaller‚Äîthan those of his actual models. Petty appeared as a guest on the popular TV program What's My Line on November 20, 1955. Petty died in San Pedro, California, on July 21, 1975. ==In popular culture== Crew of the Memphis Belle with the Petty Girl nose art * An image of a Petty Girl talking on a phone was used as the \\"nose art\\" on the famous World War II B-17 Flying Fortress, Memphis Belle. * Two images of Petty Girls were used in the crowd on The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover. * Robert Cummings portrayed George Petty in the imaginary musical comedy The Petty Girl (Columbia, 1950), directed by Henry Levin and featuring the film debut of Tippi Hedren as one of the Petty Girls. Nat Perrin's screenplay was based on a story by Mary McCarthy. The film is also notable for several lilting, lighthearted songs composed by Harold Arlen (music) and Johnny Mercer (lyrics), including \\"Fancy Free\\" and \\"I Loves Ya\\". The large production number at the finale is \\"The Petty Girl\\" by Arlen and Mercer, performed by Joan Caulfield (dubbed by Carole Richards), the Petty Girls and a male quartet. == Sources == Reid Stewart Austin (The Best of Gil Elvgren) examined the life and art of George Petty in the 192-page Petty: The Classic Pin-Up Art of George Petty. Published by Gramercy in 1997, the lavish volume features a foreword by Hugh Hefner and an introductory essay by Petty's daughter, Marjorie Petty, who was his main model. In The New York Times Book Review, famed designer George Lois praised this collection of Petty's creations, commenting: > Just as the cool, unapproachable Gibson Girl was the feminine ideal of young > men at the turn of the century, the voluptuous Petty Girl became the ideal > of their wide-eyed sons.

He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball for the Chicago White Sox for the majority of his career. Known for his fine handling of pitchers and outstanding defensive ability, Schalk was considered the greatest defensive catcher of his era. He revolutionized the way the catching position was played by using his speed and agility to expand the previously accepted defensive capabilities for his position. Schalk was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1955. ==Early life== Born in Harvel, Illinois to German immigrant parents, Schalk grew up in Litchfield, Illinois.Nokomis' baseball ties on display at museum.

When career advancement proved difficult in that trade, he began to play professional baseball. ==Baseball career== By the age of 18 in 1911, Schalk split time between the Class D Taylorville Christians in the Illinois‚ÄìMissouri League, where he hit .387, and the Class A Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association. In 1912, he posted a .271 batting average in 80 games for Milwaukee and attracted the attention of the Chicago White Sox because of his aggressive approach to the catching position. The White Sox purchased him from the Brewers for $10,000 and two other players. Schalk made his major league debut the day before his twentieth birthday on August 11, 1912. He appeared in 23 games that season, batting .286, but it was his defense behind the plate that impressed the most. White Sox coach Kid Gleason helped him hone his skills and, by the following year, Schalk had become the starting catcher in place of Billy Sullivan, and led the American League catchers in putouts. He soon developed a reputation as one of the best defensive catchers in major league baseball. Before Schalk, most catchers were large and slow of foot. Schalk was a small, agile man ‚Äî he was only tall ‚Äî who caught with the energy and mobility of a fifth infielder. Due to his small size and youthful appearance, he was often the butt of jokes from opposing players. One time, a policeman refused to let him into the locker room at Comiskey Park, mistaking Schalk for a child. 1914 E145-1 Cracker Jack baseball card In 1914, he batted .270 in 136 games and once again led the league in putouts by a catcher. Despite the White Sox's sixth-place finish, he ranked sixth in voting for the 1914 American League Most Valuable Player Award. He continued to improve in 1915, batting .266 with a .366 on-base percentage, and leading American League catchers in fielding percentage, caught stealing percentage and putouts as the White Sox rose to third place. In 1916, Schalk had a career-high 30 stolen bases (a record for a catcher, until John Wathan broke it in 1982) and led the league in fielding percentage, putouts assists and range factor as the White Sox finished in second place, only two games behind the Boston Red Sox. His pitch-calling skills were evident as he guided the White Sox pitching staff to the lowest earned run average in the league. He batted only .226 in 1917, but his on-base percentage was .331 and he led all American League catchers in putouts for a fifth consecutive year. He once again guided the White Sox pitching staff to the lowest earned run average in the league as they won 100 games to win the American League pennant by 9 games over the Boston Red Sox, and went on to defeat John McGraw's New York Giants in the 1917 World Series, four games to two, for their last world championship until 2005. In 1918, he recorded his first putout at second base against the St. Louis Browns. On a hit and run play, the Browns' Ray Demmitt ran past second base as Shoeless Joe Jackson made a catch in deep left field off the bat of Joe Gedeon. Schalk, in the middle of the diamond, ran to second base to take the relay from White Sox shortstop Swede Risberg and tagged Demmitt out. The White Sox fell to sixth place in the 1918 season, however, as Schalk batted only .219. They rebounded in 1919 to recapture the American League pennant, with Schalk hitting a career-high .282 and leading the league in putouts for a seventh consecutive season. The 1919 World Series, which the White Sox lost to the Cincinnati Reds, was shrouded in a controversy which became known as the Black Sox Scandal. Several White Sox players were accused of intentionally throwing games. This was in sharp contrast to Schalk, who played to win, hitting for a Series .304 batting average and later being absolved from any wrongdoing. He told investigators he knew something was wrong when pitchers Eddie Cicotte and Lefty Williams didn't throw the pitches he had called for. The White Sox lost the series five games to three, and eight of their players were banned for life from major league baseball as complicit in the scandal, but not Schalk. Years later, Schalk said that the conspirators caught a break when one of the \\"Clean Sox,\\" pitcher Red Faber, was forced to sit out the Series with the flu. Schalk believed that had Faber been available, there would have never been a fix (since Faber would have likely gotten starts that went to Cicotte and Williams). He had another good year in 1920, hitting .270 with a .362 on-base percentage and a career-high 61 runs batted in. He led the American League for an eighth consecutive year in putouts as the White Sox finished in second place. The 1922 season was one of his finest. On April 30, 1922, he caught Charlie Robertson's perfect game against the Detroit Tigers, the last perfect game in the major leagues until Don Larsen's in the 1956 World Series. Two months later, on June 27, he hit for the cycle. He ended the season with a .281 average, hit 4 home runs and drove in 60 runs. He led the league in putouts, and tied the American League record for fielding percentage for a catcher at .989. He finished third in voting for the 1922 American League's Most Valuable Player Award. By 1924, the wear and tear of catching began to catch up with him. He had played in 100 games or more in 11 consecutive seasons, but injured three fingers on his throwing hand which limited him to 57 games and a career-low .197 batting average in 1924. He rebounded in 1925 to play in 125 games, bat .274 with a career-high .382 on-base percentage, and lead the league in baserunners caught stealing. In November 1926, he succeeded Eddie Collins as the White Sox player-manager at the age of 33. His playing time diminished in 1927, as he appeared in only 16 games while concentrating on managing the team. Over the two seasons he played and managed, he won 102 and lost 125 for a .449 won-lost percentage. He then had a salary disagreement with team owner Charles Comiskey, and left the White Sox to become a player- coach with the New York Giants in 1929, but appeared in only five games before retiring as a player at the age of 36. ==Career statistics and legacy== Schalk's plaque at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum In an 18-year major league career, Schalk played in 1,762 games, accumulating 1,345 hits in 5,306 at bats for a .253 career batting average along with 11 home runs, 594 runs batted in, 579 runs, 177 stolen bases, an on-base percentage of .340 and a .981 fielding percentage. He established himself as one of the American League's outstanding defensive catchers by leading AL catchers in fielding percentage eight times, putouts nine times, double plays four times and assists twice. He set major league catching records for putouts, and still holds the major league career record for double plays (217) and the American League career mark for assists. No catcher has approached Schalk's record for career double plays, and none has led the league in fielding percentage eight times. He held the record for most no-hitters caught (four), until a rules change in the early 1990s disallowed one of them. Schalk's 51.32% career caught stealing percentage ranks eighth all-time among major league catchers. He caught 144 shutouts in his career, ranking third all-time among catchers behind Yogi Berra and Carlton Fisk. He set standards for longevity for catchers, catching 100 or more games for 11 straight seasons. His major league record of 1,726 games caught stood until 1945 when it was broken by Rick Ferrell. He also established himself as one of the finest baserunning catchers, setting a single-season stolen base record for the position in 1916 with 30, which stood until John Wathan stole 36 bases in 1982. His record for 177 career stolen bases as a catcher still stands. Schalk helped revolutionize the way the catcher's position was played. He is credited with being the first catcher to back up infield throws to first base and outfield throws to third base. He claimed to be the only major league catcher to have made a putout at every base, and once made three assists in one inning. He also became known for his handling of the White Sox pitching staff and his pitch-calling skills. His reputation as a defensive standout is enhanced due to the era in which he played: in the deadball era, catchers played a much greater defensive role than subsequently, given the large number of bunts and stolen base attempts, as well as the difficulty of handling the spitball pitchers who dominated pitching staffs. He had to catch every type of pitch imaginable, including shine balls, spitballs, knuckleballs and emory balls from pitchers such as, Ed Walsh, Eddie Cicotte, Dickie Kerr, Urban Faber and Ted Lyons. Schalk's career batting average of .253 is the lowest of any position player in the Hall of Fame. That he was selected by the Veterans Committee for enshrinement in is largely a tribute to his outstanding defensive skills and to the fact that he played to win the infamous 1919 World Series for the White Sox.James, Bill (1995). Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?, p.111-117. Free Press. . ==Post-playing career== Schalk became a coach for the Chicago Cubs in 1930 and 1931, and later managed the Buffalo Bisons in the Double-A International League from to . He also managed the Indianapolis Indians, the Oklahoma City Indians and the Milwaukee Brewers minor league teams. In , he became a scout for the Chicago Cubs. He was assistant baseball coach at Purdue University for 18 years before retiring from baseball at 72. In 1955, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee. He was invited to catch the first ball of the 1959 World Series‚Äìthe White Sox' first appearance in the World Series in 40 years‚Äìthrown out by fellow Hall of Fame member and former White Sox pitcher Red Faber. A museum in Nokomis, Illinois, is dedicated to Schalk and two other Hall of Famers, Jim Bottomley and Red Ruffing. The Little League ball fields in Litchfield, Illinois, near his birthplace of Harvel, are named for him. He died of cancer on May 19, 1970, at the age of 78, and is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Evergreen Park, Illinois. ==In popular culture== Schalk was portrayed by Gordon Clapp in the 1988 film Eight Men Out. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders *List of Major League Baseball player-managers * List of players who have hit for the cycle == References == == Further reading == * == External links == * : Category:1892 births Category:1970 deaths Category:People from Litchfield, Illinois Category:People from Christian County, Illinois Category:National Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Category:Major League Baseball catchers Category:Major League Baseball player-managers Category:Baseball players from Illinois Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Chicago Cubs coaches Category:Chicago Cubs scouts Category:Chicago White Sox managers Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Indianapolis Indians players Category:Milwaukee Brewers (minor league) managers Category:Milwaukee Brewers (minor league) players Category:New York Giants (NL) players Category:Buffalo Bisons (minor league) managers Category:Indianapolis Indians managers Category:Taylorville Christians players Category:American people of German descent Category:Deaths from cancer in Illinois Category:Purdue Boilermakers baseball coaches ","title":"Ray Schalk"},{"id":"819847","text":"Doughnut production line A production line is a set of sequential operations established in a factory where components are assembled to make a finished article or where materials are put through a refining process to produce an end-product that is suitable for onward consumption Typically, raw materials such as metal ores or agricultural products such as foodstuffs or textile source plants like cotton and flax require a sequence of treatments to render them useful. For metal, the processes include crushing, smelting and further refining. For plants, the useful material has to be separated from husks or contaminants and then treated for onward sale. ==History== Early production processes were constrained by the availability of a source of energy, with wind mills and water mills providing power for the crude heavy processes and manpower being used for activities requiring more precision. In earlier centuries, with raw materials, power and people often being in different locations, production was distributed across a number of sites. The concentration of numbers of people in manufactories, and later the factory as exemplified by the cotton mills of Richard Arkwright, started the move towards co-locating individual processes. ===Introduction of the steam engine=== With the development of the steam engine in the latter half of the 18th century, the production elements became less reliant on the location of the power source, and so the processing of goods moved to either the source of the materials or the location of people to perform the tasks. Separate processes for different treatment stages were brought into the same building, and the various stages of refining or manufacture were combined. ===Industrial revolution=== With increasing use of steam power, and increasing use of machinery to supplant the use of people, the integrated use of techniques in production lines spurred the industrial revolutions of Europe and North America. ==Assembly line== Thus, from the processing of raw materials into useful goods, the next step was the concept of the assembly line, as introduced by Eli Whitney. This was taken to the next stage at the Ford Motor Company in 1913, where Henry Ford introduced the innovation of continuously moving the cars being assembled past individual workstations. This introduced the idea of standardization. The assembly line was a contraption of many chains and links that moved to place different parts into various places throughout the car. The chassis of the car was moved along the 45-metre line by a chain conveyor and then 140 workers applied their assigned parts to the chassis. Other workers brought additional parts to the car builders to keep them stocked. The assembly line decreased the assembly time per vehicle. The production time for a single car dropped from over twelve hours to just 93 minutes. ==See also== *Conveyor *J√≥zsef Galamb *Mass production *Pilot plant == External links == *production line - examples Category:Industrial Revolution Category:Manufacturing Category:Mass production de:Flie√übandfertigung ","title":"Production line"},{"id":"819850","text":"Perentie (Varanus giganteus) Ngi·πâ·πØaka (pronounced nin-taka), also spelled Ngintaku, is a giant perentie lizard spirit being of Australian Aboriginal \\"Dreaming\\" Creation mythology. == Summary == The Ngi·πâ·πØaka is one of several Creation Ancestor Beings of the A·πâangu Pitjantjatjara Western Desert Speaking Original people of Central Australia. It is associated with Angatja, an area along an important Tjukurpa or Dreaming Songline. It is one of the two great reptiles of Uluru (Ayers Rock), Ngi·πâ·πØaka and Milpali. Ngi·πâ·πØaka Songline is the major creation story in the Angatja area. Pitjantjatjara land is criss-crossed by the tracks of many Creation Ancestor Beings; the lizard, carpet python, snake, dingo, emu, tjala (honey ant) and maku (witchetty grub), among many others. == Myth Summary == The story of Ngi·πâ·πØaka is one of theft, vengeance and the uselessness of possessions. The saga is told with the \\"Inma Ngi·πâ·πØaka\\", a dance of Ngi·πâ·πØaka's journey of creation that includes a song whose stanzas follow his travels through the land, thus the 500 km trail is called a Songline. The Ngi·πâ·πØaka Man travelled from his home near the Western Australia border to the camp of another lizard tribe, near Oodnadatta, in search of a special grindstone. == Myth details == Ngintaka Tjukurpa alatji - paluru ngura parari nyinangi tjiwa wiya, paluru tjiwa kurakuratjara nyinangi munu paluru mai wakati rungkaningi, munu rungkara uninypa uninymankula ngalkuningi. This is the story of the Perentie Man - he was living in a distant place without a grindstone, he only had a very poor quality grindstone and he was trying to grind the seed from wild pigweed, and he was having to eat these rough seedcakes. Munu paluru kulinu: \\"Ay, tjiwa kutjupa ruulmananyi, ruultjinga rungkani ngura parari.\\" Munu kulira paluru mapalku anu ngura kutjupakutu. Munu paluru ankula nyangu, tjiwa palunya. Munu mantjinu, munu kutitlura ngalya- katingu. And he thought: \\"Ah, someone is grinding, there is the sound of grinding coming from a long way away.\\" And having heard he quickly travelled to that other place. And he travelled and travelled and then he saw that other grindstone. And he took it, he stole it and carried it back to his camp. As the Ngi·πâ·πØaka travelled he created many landforms in the Musgrave and Mann Ranges and he vomited up many different kinds of grass seeds and vegetable food as he went. == Geography == According to the mythology, Mount Woodroffe, the highest mountain in South Australia, is also the Ngi·πâ·πØaka Man as he rears up to look over the country. He is returning to his home in the west. The significance of these cultural routes is central to Pitjantjatjara spiritual connection to land. Each individual is custodian of the land they are born in and the Creation Ancestor who walked and sung that land into being in the beginning. If the land and songline is destroyed people are severed from the core of their being, they get sick and die. == External links == * MAKING TRACKS.

It was converted to a U.S. Army Air Corps airfield just weeks after the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. It was renamed Dover Army Airbase on April 8, 1943; *Dover Subbase on June 6, 1943, and Dover Army Airfield on February 2, 1944. With the establishment of the United States Air Force on September 18, 1947, the facility was renamed Dover Air Force Base on January 13, 1948. ===World War II=== The origins of Dover Air Force Base begin in March 1941 when the United States Army Air Corps indicated a need for the airfield as a training airfield and assumed jurisdiction over the municipal airport at Dover, Delaware. Once the airport came under military control an immediate construction program began to turn the civil airport into a military airfield. Construction involved runways and airplane hangars, with three concrete runways, several taxiways and a large parking apron and a control tower. Several large hangars were also constructed. Buildings were ultimately utilitarian and quickly assembled. Most base buildings, not meant for long-term use, were constructed of temporary or semi-permanent materials. Although some hangars had steel frames and the occasional brick or tile brick building could be seen, most support buildings sat on concrete foundations but were of frame construction clad in little more than plywood and tarpaper. Initially under USAAC, the name of the facility was Municipal Airport, Dover Airdrome and the airfield opened on 17 December 1941. The airfield was assigned to First Air Force. On 20 December the first military unit arrived at Dover's new airfield: the 112th Observation Squadron of the Ohio National Guard which flew anti-submarine patrols off the Delaware Coast. In early 1942 three B-25 Mitchell bomber squadrons arrived with the 45th Bombardment Group from I Bomber Command, later part of Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command, assumed the anti-submarine mission. On 8 April 1943, the name of the airfield was changed to Dover Army Air Base. The antisubmarine mission ended on 6 June and construction crews moved back to the base for a major upgrading project that lengthened the main runway to 7,000 feet. During the construction period and continuing into June 1944, Dover AAB became a sub- base of Camp Springs Army Airfield, Maryland. Full operational capability was restored to Dover in September, and seven P-47 Thunderbolt squadrons arrived for training in preparation for eventual involvement in the European Theater. The 83d Fighter Group was assigned to Dover as the Operational Training Unit. The 83d was redesignated the 125th Base Unit on 10 April 1944 with little change in its mission. It was further redesignated as the 125th Army Air Force base Unit on 15 September 1944. In 1944 the Air Technical Service Command chose Dover as a site to engineer, develop, and conduct classified air- launched rocket tests. The information collected during these experiments resulted in the effective deployment of air-to-surface rockets in both the European and Pacific combat theaters. On 1 September 1946 as a result of the drawdown of United States forces after World War II, Dover Army Airfield, was placed on temporary inactive status. A small housekeeping unit, the 4404th Base Standby Squadron, remained on the airfield for care and maintenance of the facility. ===Cold War and Vietnam=== left Dover Airfield was reactivated on 1 August 1950 as a result of the Korean War and the expansion of the United States Air Force in response to the Soviet threat in the Cold War. On February 1, 1951, the 148th Fighter Interceptor Squadron of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard arrived with P-51 Mustangs. During the 1950s problems developed with many of the facilities in Dover, which had been hastily constructed to support its World War II mission. As a result, a massive Civil Engineering project was undertaken to modernize the base. On April 1, 1952, Dover was transferred to the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) and became home to 1607th Air Transport Wing (Heavy) (1607 ATW(H)). A full function hospital was completed in 1958 and base housing was expanded to handle 1,200 families in 1961. On January 1, 1966, the Military Air Transport Service was redesignated the Military Airlift Command (MAC). Along with the reorganization, the 1607 ATW was discontinued and the 436th Military Airlift Wing (436 MAW) activated and assumed the mission at Dover. The 436 MAW started replacing C-141 Starlifters and C-133 Cargomasters with the new C-5 Galaxy in 1971. Two years later Dover became the first all C-5 equipped wing in the Air Force, trading the last of its C-141 to Charleston AFB, South Carolina. During the Vietnam War, more than 20,000 dead American soldiers were brought back to the United States via Dover. The Vietnam War dead comprise over 90% of all the remains processed at Dover before 1988. When war broke out between Israel and the combine forces of Egypt and Syria on October 13, 1973 (the Yom Kippur War) the 436 MAW responded with a 32-day airlift that delivered 22,305 tons of munitions and military equipment to Israel. The 436 MAW also assisted in the evacuation of Americans from Iran on December 9, 1978, following the Islamic Revolution. That year, Dover Air Force Base was also used to store hundreds of bodies from the mass murder and suicide of the Jonestown community in Guyana.http://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=33020 Some of the more memorable flights during the post-war period included the airdrop and test firing of a Minuteman I intercontinental ballistic missile and the delivery of a 40-ton superconducting magnet to Moscow during the Cold War, for which the crew received the Mackay Trophy. After the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, the remains of the seven astronauts were transferred to Dover AFB. It is one of only seven airports in the country that served as launch abort facilities for the Space Shuttle.Space Shuttle Emergency Landing Sites In March 1989, C-5s from Dover delivered special equipment used to clean up the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound. On June 7, 1989, while attending the Airlift Rodeo, a 436 MAW C-5 set a world record when it airdropped 190,346 pounds and 73 paratroopers. In October 1983, the wing flew 24 missions in support of Operation Urgent Fury, the Grenada rescue operation and later flew 16 missions to support Operation Just Cause, the invasion of Panama, in December 1989 ‚Äì January 1990. During Desert Shield, the wing flew approximately 17,000 flying hours and airlifted a total of 131,275 tons of cargo in support of combat operations to free the Kingdom of Kuwait. Southern Air Transport leased a hangar at the south east end of the base in the 1980s,during Iran Contra. ===Modern era=== Aerial view of Dover Air Force Base in 1995 In 1992, with the disestablishment of Military Air Command, Dover AFB was transferred to the newly established Air Mobility Command (AMC) and the 436 MAW and 512 MAW (Associate) were redesignated as the 436th Airlift Wing (436 AW) and the 512th Airlift Wing (512 AW), respectively. Dover also served as a major port of entry and exit for the conflicts in the Balkans and Somalia during the latter half of the 1990s. Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, the 436 AW and 512 AW became major participants in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. An aircrew from Dover's 3rd Airlift Squadron landed the first C-5 in Iraq in late 2003 when they landed at Baghdad International Airport and the two wings continue to support operations in the region. Also following September 11, 2001, Army mortuary specialists organized support for Pentagon recovery efforts out of the Base. This effort evolved into the Joint Personal Effects Depot, which supports recovery and redistribution of the personal effects of wounded and killed personnel from all arms of the military. In 2003, the Depot was transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Dover AFB is also where service members, from all five branches of service, killed in combat are repatriated. Their remains are processed, inspected for unexploded ordnance, cleaned, and prepared for burial before being escorted to the point of interment decided by the family. The Depot returned to Dover in 2011, when in April a new US$14 million custom-built facility officially opened. On April 3, 2006, a C-5 Galaxy crashed short of a runway, skidding into a farm field. There were no fatalities. By 2008, the air traffic tower serving the airfield, built in 1955, was the oldest such tower in use in the United States Air Force. In 2009 the base received a new 128-foot tall tower, overlapping the original 103-foot one which was donated to the AMC museum, accessible to visitors. Dover Air Force Base is the first Air Force Base to receive a C-5M \\"Super Galaxy\\", receiving the aircraft on February 9, 2009 (named \\"The Spirit of Global Reach\\"). On February 2, 2015 the 9,600 foot runway 01-19 was closed for repairs. The runway was re-opened for operation on September 23, 2016. During the repair, the 12,900 foot runway 14‚Äì32 was temporarily cut in half so that the intersection of the two runways could be repaired. C17s could land on either half of runway 14‚Äì32. == Role and operations == Dover AFB is home to the 436th Airlift Wing (436 AW) of the Air Mobility Command (AMC), known as the \\"Eagle Wing\\", and the AMC-gained 512th Airlift Wing (512 AW) of the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), referred to as the \\"Liberty Wing\\". It was previously the only base to solely operate the massive C-5 Galaxy and now operates both that aircraft plus the C-17 Globemaster III. The 436 AW has two active flying squadrons (the 3rd Airlift Squadron, which now operates the C-17 Globemaster III, and 9th Airlift Squadron), and the 512 AW has two Air Force Reserve flying squadrons (the 326th Airlift Squadron and the 709th Airlift Squadron). Dover AFB is also the home for the largest military mortuary in the Department of Defense, and has been used for processing military personnel killed in both war and peacetime; the remains of those killed overseas are traditionally brought to Dover AFB before being transferred to family. The Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs has also been used to identify remains of civilians in certain exceptional circumstances: in 1978 for the victims of the Jonestown mass murder/suicide, in 1986 for identifying the remains of the crew of the Space Shuttle Challenger, and in 2003 for the crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia. It was also a major site for identifying the remains of military personnel killed in the 9/11 attacks. During the night of October 28, 2009, before making a decision on the committal of further troops to Afghanistan, President Barack Obama visited the base to receive the bodies of several American soldiers killed in Afghanistan. Two sections of the 436th Aerial Port Squadron warehouse collapsed on February 18, 2003, as a result of a record snow storm. No one was injured in the collapse that caused more than an estimated $1 million in damages. The damage covered two of the six cargo processing bays in the facility. Dover AFB is also home to the Air Mobility Command Museum. ===Air Show=== Dover Air Force Base holds an annual air show, with the most recent occurring in August 2017.https://amcmuseum.org/events/2017-dover-afb- airshow/ The show includes static displays of military aircraft and equipment, and flight demonstrations of the United States Air Force Thunderbirds or Blue Angels demonstration teams. == Based units == Flying and notable non-flying units based at Dover Air Force Base. === United States Air Force === Air Mobility Command (AMC) * Eighteenth Air Force ** 436th Comptroller Squadron ** 436th Airlift Wing (Host wing) *** 436th Operations Group **** 3rd Airlift Squadron ‚Äì C-17A Globemaster III **** 9th Airlift Squadron ‚Äì C-5M Super Galaxy **** 436th Operations Support Squadron *** 436th Maintenance Group **** 436th Aerial Port Squadron **** 436th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron **** 736th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron **** 436th Maintenance Operations Squadron **** 436th Maintenance Squadron **** *** 436th Mission Support Group **** **** 436th Civil Engineer Squadron **** 436th Communications Squadron **** 436th Contracting Squadron **** 436th Force Support Squadron **** 436th Logistics Readiness Squadron **** 436th Security Forces Squadron *** 436th Medical Group **** 436th Aerospace Medicine Squadron **** 436th Medical Operations Squadron **** 436th Medical Support Squadron Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) * Fourth Air Force ** 512th Airlift Wing *** 512th Operations Group **** 326th Airlift Squadron ‚Äì C-17A Globemaster III **** 512th Airlift Control Flight **** 512th Operations Support Squadron **** 709th Airlift Squadron ‚Äì C-5M Super Galaxy *** 512th Maintenance Group **** 512th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron **** 512th Maintenance Squadron **** 712th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron *** 512th Mission Support Group **** 46th Aerial Port Squadron **** 71st Aerial Port Squadron **** 512th Civil Engineer Squadron **** 512th Force Support Squadron **** 512th Logistics Readiness Squadron **** 512th Memorial Affairs Squadron **** 512th Security Forces Squadron **** 512th Aerospace Medicine Squadron === United States Army === US Army Human Resources Command * The Adjutant General Directorate ** Casualty & Mortuary Affairs Operations Center *** Joint Personal Effects Depot === Department of Defense === Defense Health Agency * Research and Innovation Directorate ** Armed Forces Medical Examiner System === Department of the Air Force === Field Operating Agencies *Air Force Mortuary Affairs Operations (AFMAO) ** Charles C.

Volume 1: Active Air Force Bases Within the United States of America on 17 September 1982. USAF Reference Series, Office of Air Force History, United States Air Force, Washington, D.C. , ==Geography== The base is treated as a census-designated place named \\"Dover Base Housing.\\" It is part of the Dover, Delaware Metropolitan Statistical Area. Dover Base Housing had a population of 3,450 at the 2010 census. According to the United States Census Bureau, Dover Base Housing has a total area of 0.7 square miles (1.7 km2), all of it land. Dover Base Housing consists of a development called Eagle Heights Family Housing, which is made up of 980 homes in single-family, duplex, triplex, and fourplex configurations. The development features a community center, multiple neighborhood centers, picnic areas, fitness center, and golf course. Eagle Heights Family Housing contains a total of of greenbelt paths for walking, jogging, and biking. Students in the development attend public schools in the Caesar Rodney School District. Since 1997, the base has been served by three highway exits with Delaware Route 1, allowing quick access to Dover and to southern Delaware from the complex. Dover AFB provides almost $470 million a year in revenue to the city of Dover, making it the third largest industry in Delaware. ==Demographics== As of the census of 2000, there were 3,394 people, 1,032 households, and 1,017 families residing in the base. The population density was 5,061.6 people per square mile (1,955.9/km2). There were 1,245 housing units at an average density of 1,856.7 per square mile (717.5/km2). The racial makeup of the base was 72.57% White, 16.59% African American, 0.77% Native American, 1.86% Asian, 0.12% Pacific Islander, 2.80% from other races, and 5.30% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 7.75% of the population. There were 6,032 households, out of which 76.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 90.2% were married couples living together, 5.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 1.4% were non-families. 1.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 0.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.29 and the average family size was 3.30. In the base the population was spread out, with 40.2% under the age of 18, 16.5% from 18 to 24, 41.5% from 25 to 44, 1.7% from 45 to 64, and 0.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 23 years. For every 100 females, there were 103.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.5 males. The median income for a household in the base was $34,318, and the median income for a family was $34,659. Males had a median income of $26,322 versus $20,444 for females. The per capita income for the base was $12,119. About 5.2% of families and 4.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.5% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over. ==Air Mobility Command Museum== C-54 with visitors at the AMC museum Hangar 1301 at Dover Air Force Base is home to the Air Mobility Command Museum. The museum is dedicated to military airlift and air refueling aircraft and the people who maintain them. It has a large collection of fully restored cargo and tanker aircraft. Tours are conducted during the day by volunteers, many of whom are retired pilots, navigators, flight engineers and loadmasters who provide first-person narratives of actual events. The hangar encloses over of aircraft display gallery plus of exhibit rooms. An attached building houses a theater, museum store, exhibit workshop, and various offices. A aircraft parking area allows close-up inspection of the outside aircraft. The museum also maintains archives related to the history of the Air Mobility Command and Dover AFB. Building 1301, Dover Air Force Base was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. There are 33 airframes in the collection in 2015, and a staff of more than 170 volunteers. A single battered Douglas C-47A Skytrain, salvaged in 1986 off of a dump at Olmsted Air Force Base, near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, after being used for target practice, was the museum's modest beginning. Airlifted to Dover AFB by a Pennsylvania National Guard helicopter, \\"It was the first aircraft restored for the newly conceptualized museum that would form here.\\" Founded as the Dover AFB Historical Center on 13 October 1986, it originally was housed in three hangars within the main area of the base. It was officially recognized with museum status in 1995 and moved to its current location in 1996. On 5 February 1997, Air Mobility Command officially named the Dover AFB Museum as the AMC Museum.Cacicia, Zachary, Airman 1st Class, \\"AMCM: It all started with one wrecked airplane\\", Hangar Digest, The AMC Museum Foundation Inc., Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, January ‚Äì March 2015, Volume 15, Number 1, page 12. ==See also== * Delaware World War II Army Airfields * Dover test * Eastern Air Defense Force (Air Defense Command) * 436th Airlift Wing * 512th Airlift Wing ==References== * * * ==External links== * Aviation: From Sand Dunes to Sonic Booms, a National Park Service Discover Our Shared Heritage Travel Itinerary * Civil Air Terminal at Dover AFB (official site) * Dover Air Force Base at GlobalSecurity.org * * Air Mobility Command Museum Official Website * Air Mobility Command Museum Photos of the aviation museum at Dover Air Force Base * * Dover AFB Directory Category:1941 establishments in Delaware Category:Bases of the United States Air Force Category:Airports in Delaware Category:Census-designated places in Kent County, Delaware Category:Military installations in Delaware Category:Military Superfund sites Category:Airfields of the United States Army Air Forces in Delaware Category:Military facilities on the National Register of Historic Places in Delaware Category:Superfund sites in Delaware Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Delaware Category:Census-designated places in Delaware Category:National Register of Historic Places in Dover, Delaware ","title":"Dover Air Force Base"},{"id":"819950","text":"C130 or C-130 may refer to : * Lockheed C-130 Hercules, a large aircraft, mainly used to transport cargo * C130J, an upgraded version of C130 * Bombardier CSeries-130, a 130-seat variant of the Bombardier CSeries aircraft family * Medical Care and Sickness Benefits Convention, 1969 code ","title":"C130"},{"id":"819958","text":"A medal in honor of Fra Mauro, \\"an incomparable cosmographer\\", produced soon after his death, probably by the artist Giovanni Bold√π Fra Mauro, O.S.B. Cam., (c.1400-1464) was an Italian cartographer who lived in the Republic of Venice. He created the most detailed and accurate map of the world up until that time, the Fra Mauro map. Mauro was a monk of the Camaldolese Monastery of St. Michael, located on the island of Murano in the Venetian Lagoon. It was there that he maintained a cartography workshop. He also was employed by some very powerful men like Prince Henry the Navigator. == Biography == Fra Mauro was born before or around the year 1400. In his youth, Mauro had traveled extensively as a merchant and a soldier. He was familiar with the Middle East. He is recorded in the records of the Monastery of St. Michael from 1409. As a lay member of the monastery, Mauro was employed as mapmaker. In the records of the monastery his main job was recorded as collecting the monastery's rents, but from the 1450s he is also mentioned as the creator of a series of world maps. Although he was no longer free to travel, due to his religious status, he would frequently consult with merchants of the city upon their return from overseas voyages. By 1450 he composed a great mappa mundi - a world map - with surprising accuracy, including extensive written comments reflecting the geographic knowledge of his time. The map is known today as the \\"Fra Mauro map\\". ==The Fra Mauro world map== The 1450 ca. Fra Mauro map (inverted, South is normally at the top). The map is a world map that depicts Asia, Africa and Europe. The Fra Mauro world map, or mappa mundi, was a major cartographical work that compiled much of the geographical knowledge of the time. The map covers over five square meters. The map is extremely detailed and contains many thousands of texts and illustrations. The world map took several years to complete and was the most detailed and accurate world map that had been produced up until that time. Fra Mauro created the map under a commission by King Afonso V of Portugal. Andrea Bianco, a sailor-cartographer, is recorded as having collaborated with Fra Mauro in creating the map, as payments made to him between 1448 and 1459 testify. The map was completed on 24 April 1459, and sent to Portugal, but that copy didn't survive. Along with the map was a letter from the Doge of Venice. It was intended for Prince Henry the Navigator, Afonso V's uncle. It encouraged the prince to continue funding exploratory journeys. Fra Mauro died the following year, while he was making a copy of the map for the Signoria of Venice. The copy was completed by Andrea Bianco. A commemorative medal of the period struck in honor of his cartographic work describes Fra Mauro as \\"chosmographus incomparabilis\\". ==Other works== Two copies of maps by Fra Mauro are known to survive. One is a portolan chart in the Vatican Library, (Codice Borgiano V) published by Roberto Almagi√† in 1944.Almagi√†, discussing the copy of another map by Fra Mauro, in the Vatican Library: Roberto Almagi√†, Monumenta cartographica vaticana, (Rome 1944) I:32‚Äì40; Heinrich Winter, \\"The Fra Mauro Portolan Chart in the Vatican\\" Imago Mundi 16 (1962), pp. 17‚Äì28. The other was recognized by Antonio Ratti as a copy signed by Giorgio Callapoda at Candia and dated 1541, of a lost chart by Fra Mauro, sold at auction in Milan in 1984Galleria Salomon Agustoni Agrati, 24 October 1984, 40,000,000 lire and now in a private collection, probably in France.Antonio Ratti, \\" A Lost Map of Fra Mauro Found in a Sixteenth Century Copy\\" Imago Mundi 40 (1988), pp. 77‚Äì85. ==Tributes== The crater Fra Mauro and associated Fra Mauro formation of the Moon are named after him. The Apollo 13 lunar mission was intended to explore the Fra Mauro formation, but ‚Äì due to the explosion aboard the spacecraft ‚Äì Apollo 13's crew had to return to Earth without landing on the Moon. The formation was instead explored by astronauts Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell of the Apollo 14 mission in February 1971. == Bibliography == Cattaneo, Angelo, Il mappamondo di Fra Mauro.

The pass is at a strategic location near at the southern end of the Sangre de Cristos in east central Santa Fe County southeast of the city of Santa Fe. Historically, the pass provided the most direct route through the mountains between the upper valley of the Pecos River to the east and the upper valley of the Rio Grande to the west. In the 19th century, it furnished the route of the westernmost leg of the Santa Fe Trail between Santa Fe and the High Plains. The Battle of Glorieta Pass, the decisive battle of the New Mexico Campaign of the American Civil War, was fought near the pass in March 1862. The victory by the Union Army (primarily in the form of the Colorado Militia) prevented the breakout of the Confederate Army forces onto the High Plains on the east side of Sangre de Cristo Mountains, halting the intended Confederate advance northward along the base of the Rocky Mountains. The battle is commemorated at Pecos National Historic Park on the east side of the pass. In the 20th century, the pass became used as the route of U.S. Highway 84 and later Interstate 25. The town of Glorieta is located on the eastern side of the pass. The stairwells of the Colorado State Capitol Building display cannonballs from the battle as ornaments. In 1879, the New Mexico and Southern Pacific Railroad constructed a railroad through the pass, which became part of the second North American transcontinental railroad in March 1881. The NM&SP; was absorbed into its parent company, the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad in 1899, and the Santa Fe used the route for their Chicago to Los Angeles trains, including the famed El Capitan and Super Chief. Now part of the BNSF system, this remains the route of Amtrak's Southwest Chief, with one passenger train each direction daily, but little freight. It is one of the last places where semaphore signals are still in use on a major United States railroad.Myrick, David F.

It was proposed by and named for Senator Arthur Vandenberg. Negotiations over the nature and degree of US commitment to the defense of its North Atlantic allies were complicated by the conflicting desire of the allies for an iron-clad assurance of immediate US intervention in case of a Soviet attack and the insistence of the U.S. Senate that its constitutional prerogatives be preserved, especially the power to commit the United States to war. State Department officials, after assuming a common position of support for the idea of a treaty, patiently wove together a text that balanced the concerns of its European allies, the Senate, and the US military. Domestic US politics, particularly those arising from the presidential election of 1948, played an important role in the international and congressional negotiations. In keeping with practices worked out during the congressional debate over the Marshall Plan, discussions between administration and Republican leaders over collective security arrangements in Europe were held between April and June 1948. The talks reflected the likelihood of a Republican (GOP) presidential victory in the November elections. Republican Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and President pro tempore of the Senate, was a leading candidate for the GOP presidential nomination before dropping out of the contest. In friendly and candid talks with Secretary of State Marshall and Under Secretary Lovett, Vandenberg embraced the concept of a North Atlantic alliance and agreed to support it in the Senate only if substantive negotiations were delayed until after the elections and the UN Charter was more clearly affirmed and invoked in the prospective treaty. The role of personal relations in foreign policy was demonstrated by Lovett's informal discussions with Vandenberg. The senator, now a convinced internationalist, wanted to be helpful but was mindful of political realities, which he sought to impress on the Under Secretary and the Truman administration. In an April 11 meeting, Lovett tactfully probed Vandenberg's thinking on a number of key issues, including the type of aid Congress would approve; the form of a pact, particularly the willingness of the Senate to approve a slightly modified version of the Rio Treaty with regard to Europe; the role of the United Nations in collective security arrangements; and the legislative preparation needed for eventual conclusion of a long-term European security agreement. A week later Vandenberg and Lovett discussed the wording of a resolution that would provide the legislative groundwork for a long-term pact. On May 11, Vandenberg presented a resolution that he had drafted with Lovett to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which approved it. On June 11 Vandenberg introduced and the Senate passed by a vote of 82 to 13 a resolution advising the President to seek US and free world security through support of mutual defense arrangements that operated within the UN Charter but outside the Security Council, where the Soviet veto would thwart collective defense arrangements. Paragraph 3 of the resolution referred to issues of military assistance or alliance, encouraging \\"association by the United States, by constitutional process, with such regional and other collective arrangements as are based on continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, and as effects its national security.\\" The Vandenberg Resolution was the landmark action that opened the way to the negotiation of the North Atlantic Treaty. While it is clear that the concept of such an alliance first arose during the Pentagon Talks in Washington in March, American action would have been stymied without the Senate action endorsing an internationalist role for the United States. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he asserted that \\"politics stops at the water's edge\\" and cooperated with the Truman administration in forging bipartisan support. Francis O. Wilcox, first chief of staff of the Foreign Relations Committee, recalls that Vandenberg's Senate career stands as a monument to bipartisanship in American foreign policy: \\"his legacy continues.\\" Recently, \\"the Senate bestowed a unique honor on the Michigan senator,\\" voting to add his portrait to a \\"very select collection\\" in the United States Senate Reception Room. \\"Arthur Vandenberg: A Featured Biography\\" United States Senate Historical Office.

It lies between Totton and Hythe on the western shore of Southampton Water and directly east of the New Forest. The population of the village in the 2011 census was 6,141.http://www.ukcensusdata.com/marchwood-e05004602#sthash.mu9tIVyT.dpbs ==History== Marchwood has seen human activity since Roman times. The Roman road from the Calshot/Lepe area passed through here on its way to Nursling (Onna as it was called). Roman coins have been found at Bury Farm. The name \\"Marchwood\\" is most probably from the Old English \\"merecewudu\\" meaning \\"smallage wood\\" (\\"smallage\\" is a term for wild celery). It is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \\"Merceode\\", when the manor was held by Alwin, whose father Wulfgeat held the manor before 1066.Domesday Map ‚Äì Marchwood The manor of Marchwood eventually became known as Marchwood Romsey.Victoria County History, (1912), A History of the County of Hampshire: Volume 5, Eling John de Romsey held the vill of Marchwood in 1316. He was succeeded by Sir Walter Romsey of Rockbourne, who died in 1403‚Äì4 holding land in Marchwood. The manor then passed in the same way as the manor of Romsey Horseys, until the death of Thomas Horsey in 1477. John Romsey of Tatchbury died in 1494 holding the manor from John Horsey, as did his son, another John Romsey who died in 1503. His son William Romsey sold the manor to Henry White. The manor passed from Robert White to his son William in 1564‚Äì5. In 1587 William White sold the manor to Nicholas Venables. William Rickman died in possession of the manor in 1599, leaving his daughter Katherine wife of David Urry his heir. A hundred years later, David Urry, described as of St. James, Westminster, sold the manor to Gilbert Serle of Leghorn, and it subsequently passed to Sir William Oglander. The manor afterwards passed into the Saunders family. One other manor close to Marchwood was called Bury (also Newton Bury). It occurs in a deed of the 13th century as the \\"manor of Eling called Burylond.\\" In the 16th century it was absorbed into Colbury manor, and it is now represented by Bury Farm just north of Marchwood. Marchwood was at one time in the parish of Eling, and is situated in that part of the ancient parish which lies low at the mouth of the River Test, southeast of Eling village. Cracknore, in Marchwood, was the landing place of the ferry from Southampton long before the Hythe Ferry. There was an important beacon site here at Beacon Hill, receiving and sending messages to both ends of the Isle of Wight. Marchwood became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1843, and a civil parish in 1894. The church was built and endowed by Horatio Francis Kingsford Holloway in 1843. By the beginning of the 20th century, there were Government gunpowder magazines and a Metropolitan Police barracks in Marchwood. Marchwood Military Port was built here during World War II, which played a vital role in the Normandy landings.\\"Marchwood: An unknown hero\\", BBC News, 16 April 1999 The Royal Navy Ordnance Depot was where the famous Mulberry harbours were made. The port continues to service Britain's overseas military interests. ==Demographics== ==Industry== Despite being a village, Marchwood is the home of a refuse incinerator known as Marchwood Incinerator (the remains of a previous incinerator, closed in the 1990s were finally pulled down in 2012), a sewage works, a large military port and a natural gas fuelled combined cycle power station known as Marchwood Power Station.Marchwood Power Limited replacing an older station which was dismantled during the 1980s. The 842 megawatt facility is one of the most efficient generators of electricity in the UK at 58% fuel efficiency. Until privatisation, Marchwood was home to one of the three principal research facilities of the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), concentrating on heavy plant ‚Äì the other facilities were at Leatherhead and at Berkeley. ==Education== Marchwood has two schools, an infant school situated in Twiggs Lane and a junior school in the village centre. The nearest secondary schools are Applemore College in Dibden Purlieu and Hounsdown School in Totton. The village does not have a public library. Nearby libraries are in Totton and Hythe. ==TransportRoad=== Marchwood is most easily accessed by road via the A326 road (Marchwood Bypass) which runs from the M27 motorway, past Totton, Marchwood and Hythe, as far as the village of Holbury. This then lets down the Access roads of Jacobs Gutter Lane, Staplewood Drive and Twiggs Lane. The main point of access from the south (towards Hythe) is Hythe Road. Bluestar operates one daytime bus route through Marchwood every hour Monday to Saturday. The 8 service goes to Southampton via Totton in one direction and to Hythe and Calshot in the other. There is limited public transport from the village in the evenings. Marchwood railway station and level crossing gates, c.1996. ===Rail=== Marchwood railway station opened on the Fawley Branch Line beside Main Road on 20 July 1925. The station was closed by the Beeching Axe on 14 February 1966 and has remained closed since. Freight trains still operate on the line and a set of manual level crossing gates are still used on Main Road. Hampshire County Council have agreed to fund a study into reopening the Waterside line between Totton and Hythe, with a stop at Marchwood.Daily Echo: Move to reopen former rail line ==Religious sites== Marchwood has four Christian churches. The Parish Church of St. John's; The Gospel Church; New Forest Community Church; and Fijian church, which meets in the army estate, mainly for those from Fiji posted in the military houses and barracks. The churches are active in the community: The New Forest Community Church run a local coffee shop in the village centre, the \\"sweet soul cafe\\"; The Gospel Church runs a Friday afternoon cafe \\"refreshers\\", ladies' and men's social groups, and various youth and children's clubs, meeting on Sundays at 10.30am at the Infant school; and the Parish church has strong links with the local schools. ==Sport== Marchwood is home to Staplewood Training Ground the training facilities of Southampton F.C. There is also Lloyds recreation ground which is home to a host of football clubs, as well as two tennis courts. ==Twin settlements== * Saint-Contest, near Caen, Normandy, France. ==References== == External links == *Marchwood Parish Council *Marchwood Fete *Marchwood in the Domesday Book *BBC News ‚Äì Marchwood: An unknown hero * Marchwood Guides Category:Villages in Hampshire ","title":"Marchwood"},{"id":"820041","text":"Cissoid of Diocles traced by points M with OM = M1M2. 462x462px In geometry, the cissoid of Diocles is a cubic plane curve notable for the property that it can be used to construct two mean proportionals to a given ratio. In particular, it can be used to double a cube. It can be defined as the cissoid of a circle and a line tangent to it with respect to the point on the circle opposite to the point of tangency. In fact, the curve family of cissoids is named for this example and some authors refer to it simply as the cissoid. It has a single cusp at the pole, and is symmetric about the diameter of the circle which is the line of tangency of the cusp. The line is an asymptote. It is a member of the conchoid of de Sluze family of curves and in form it resembles a tractrix. The word \\"cissoid\\" comes from the Greek Œ∫ŒπœÉœÉŒøŒµŒπŒ¥ŒÆœÇ kissoeidƒìs \\"ivy shaped\\" from Œ∫ŒπœÉœÉœåœÇ kissos \\"ivy\\" and -ŒøŒµŒπŒ¥ŒÆœÇ -oeidƒìs \\"having the likeness of\\". The curve is named for Diocles who studied it in the 2nd century BCE. ==Construction and equations== Let the radius of C be a. By translation and rotation, we may take O to be the origin and the center of the circle to be (a, 0), so A is (2a, 0). Then the polar equations of L and C are: :r=2a\\\\sec\\\\theta :r=2a\\\\cos\\\\theta. By construction, the distance from the origin to a point on the cissoid is equal to the difference between the distances between the origin and the corresponding points on L and C. In other words, the polar equation of the cissoid is :r=2a\\\\sec\\\\theta-2a\\\\cos\\\\theta=2a(\\\\sec\\\\theta-\\\\cos\\\\theta). Applying some trigonometric identities, this is equivalent to :r=2a\\\\sin^2\\\\\\\\!\\\\theta/\\\\cos\\\\theta=2a\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\tan\\\\theta. Let t=\\\\tan\\\\theta in the above equation. Then :x = r\\\\cos\\\\theta = 2a\\\\sin^2\\\\\\\\!\\\\theta = \\\\frac{2a\\\\tan^2\\\\\\\\!\\\\theta}{\\\\sec^2\\\\\\\\!\\\\theta} = \\\\frac{2at^2}{1+t^2} :y = tx = \\\\frac{2at^3}{1+t^2} are parametric equations for the cissoid. Converting the polar form to Cartesian coordinates produces :(x^2+y^2)x=2ay^2 ===Construction by double projection=== Mechanism to generate the cissoid A compass-and- straightedge construction of various points on the cissoid proceeds as follows. Given a line L and a point O not on L, construct the line L' through O parallel to L. Choose a variable point P on L, and construct Q, the orthogonal projection of P on L', then R, the orthogonal projection of Q on OP. Then the cissoid is the locus of points R. To see this, let O be the origin and L the line x = 2a as above. Let P be the point (2a, 2at); then Q is (0, 2at) and the equation of the line OP is y=tx. The line through Q perpendicular to OP is :t(y-2at)+x=0. To find the point of intersection R, set y = tx in this equation to get :t(tx-2at)+x=0,\\\\ x(t^2+1)=2at^2,\\\\ x=\\\\frac{2at^2}{t^2+1} :y=tx=\\\\frac{2at^3}{t^2+1} which are the parametric equations given above. While this construction produces arbitrarily many points on the cissoid, it cannot trace any continuous segment of the curve. ===Newton's construction=== Newton's construction The following construction was given by Isaac Newton. Let J be a line and B a point not on J. Let BST be a right angle which moves so that ST equals the distance from B to J and T remains on J, while the other leg BS slides along B. Then the midpoint P of ST describes the curve. To see this,See Basset for the derivation, many other sources give the construction. let the distance between B and J be 2a. By translation and rotation, take B = (‚àía, 0) and J the line x=a. Let P = (x, y) and let œà be the angle between SB and the x-axis; this is equal to the angle between ST and J. By construction, PT = a, so the distance from P to J is a sin œà. In other words a-x = a sin œà. Also, SP = a is the y coordinate of (x, y) if it is rotated by angle œà, so a = (x+a) sin œà + y cos œà. After simplification, this produces parametric equations :x=a(1-\\\\sin\\\\psi),\\\\,y=a\\\\frac{(1-\\\\sin\\\\psi)^2}{\\\\cos\\\\psi}. Change parameters by replacing œà with its complement to get :x=a(1-\\\\cos\\\\psi),\\\\,y=a\\\\frac{(1-\\\\cos\\\\psi)^2}{\\\\sin\\\\psi} or, applying double angle formulas, :x=2a\\\\sin^2{\\\\psi \\\\over 2},\\\\,y=a\\\\frac{4\\\\sin^4{\\\\psi \\\\over 2}}{2\\\\sin{\\\\psi \\\\over 2}\\\\cos{\\\\psi \\\\over 2}} = 2a\\\\frac{\\\\sin^3{\\\\psi \\\\over 2}}{\\\\cos{\\\\psi \\\\over 2}}. But this is polar equation :r=2a\\\\sin^2\\\\theta/\\\\cos\\\\theta given above with Œ∏=Œ®/2. Note that, as with the double projection construction, this can be adapted to produce a mechanical device that generates the curve. ==Delian problem== The Greek geometer Diocles used the cissoid to obtain two mean proportionals to a given ratio. This means that given lengths a and b, the curve can be used to find u and v so that a is to u as u is to v as v is to b i.e. a/u=u/v=v/b, as discovered by Hippocrates of Chios. As a special case, this can be used to solve the Delian problem: how much must the length of a cube be increased in order to double its volume? Specifically, if a is the side of a cube, and b=2a, then the volume of a cube of side u is :u^3=a^3(\\\\tfrac{u}{a})^3=a^3(\\\\tfrac{u}{a})(\\\\tfrac{v}{u})(\\\\tfrac{b}{v})=a^3(\\\\tfrac{b}{a})=2a^3 so u is the side of a cube with double the volume of the original cube. Note however that this solution does not fall within the rules of compass and straightedge construction since it relies on the existence of the cissoid. Let a and b be given. It is required to find u so that u3=a2b, giving u and v=u2/a as the mean proportionals. Let the cissoid :(x^2+y^2)x=2ay^2 be constructed as above, with O the origin, A the point (2a, 0), and J the line x=a, also as given above. Let C be the point of intersection of J with OA. From the given length b, mark B on J so that CB=b. Draw BA and let P = (x, y) be the point where it intersects the cissoid. Draw OP and let it intersect J at U. Then u=CU is the required length. To see this,Proof is a slightly modified version of that given in Basset. rewrite the equation of the curve as :y^2=\\\\frac{x^3}{2a-x} and let N = (x, 0), so PN is the perpendicular to OA through P. From the equation of the curve, :PN^2=\\\\frac{ON^3}{NA}. From this, :\\\\frac{PN^3}{ON^3}=\\\\frac{PN}{NA}. By similar triangles PN/ON=UC/OC and PN/NA=BC/CA. So the equation becomes :\\\\frac{UC^3}{OC^3}=\\\\frac{BC}{CA}, so :\\\\frac{u^3}{a^3}=\\\\frac{b}{a},\\\\, u^3=a^2b as required. Diocles did not really solve the Delian problem. The reason is that the cissoid of Diocles cannot be constructed perfectly, at least not with compass and straightedge. To construct the cissoid of Diocles, one would construct a finite number of its individual points, then connect all these points to form a curve. The problem is that there is no well-defined way to connect the points. If they are connected by line segments, then the construction will be well-defined, but it will not be an exact cissoid of Diocles, but only an approximation. Likewise, if the dots are connected with circular arcs, the construction will be well- defined, but incorrect. Or one could simply draw a curve directly, trying to eyeball the shape of the curve, but the result would only be imprecise guesswork. Once the finite set of points on the cissoid have been drawn, then line PC will probably not intersect one of these points exactly, but will pass between them, intersecting the cissoid of Diocles at some point whose exact location has not been constructed, but has only been approximated. An alternative is to keep adding constructed points to the cissoid which get closer and closer to the intersection with line PC, but the number of steps may very well be infinite, and the Greeks did not recognize approximations as limits of infinite steps (so they were very puzzled by Zeno's paradoxes). One could also construct a cissoid of Diocles by means of a mechanical tool specially designed for that purpose, but this violates the rule of only using compass and straightedge. This rule was established for reasons of logical -- axiomatic -- consistency. Allowing construction by new tools would be like adding new axioms, but axioms are supposed to be simple and self-evident, but such tools are not. So by the rules of classical, synthetic geometry, Diocles did not solve the Delian problem, which actually can not be solved by such means. On the other hand, if one accepts that cissoids of Diocles do exist, then there must exist at least one example of such a cissoid. This cissoid could then be translated, rotated, and expanded or contracted in size (without changing its proportional shape) at will to fit into any position. Then one would readily admit that such a cissoid can be used to correctly solve the Delian problem. ==As a pedal curve== The pedal curve of a parabola with respect to its vertex is a cissoid of Diocles. The geometrical properties of pedal curves in general produce several alternate methods of constructing the cissoid. It is the envelopes of circles whose centers lie on a parabola and which pass through the vertex of the parabola. Also, if two congruent parabolas are set vertex-to-vertex and one is rolled along the other; the vertex of the rolling parabola will trace the cissoid. A pair of parabolas face each other symmetrically: one on top and one on the bottom. Then the top parabola is rolled without slipping along the bottom one, and its successive positions are shown in the animation. Then the path traced by the vertex of the top parabola as it rolls is a roulette shown in red, which is cissoid of Diocles. ==Inversion== The cissoid of Diocles can also be defined as the inverse curve of a parabola with the center of inversion at the vertex. To see this, take the parabola to be x = y2, in polar coordinate r\\\\cos\\\\theta = (r\\\\sin \\\\theta)^2 or: :r=\\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\theta}{\\\\sin^2\\\\\\\\!\\\\theta}\\\\,. The inverse curve is thus: :r=\\\\frac{\\\\sin^2\\\\\\\\!\\\\theta}{\\\\cos\\\\theta} = \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\tan\\\\theta, which agrees with the polar equation of the cissoid above. ==References== * * * \\"Cissoid of Diocles\\" at Visual Dictionary Of Special Plane Curves * \\"Cissoid of Diocles\\" at MacTutor's Famous Curves Index * \\"Cissoid\\" on 2dcurves.com * \\"Cisso√Øde de Diocl√®s ou Cisso√Øde Droite\\" at Encyclop√©die des Formes Math√©matiques Remarquables (in French) * \\"The Cissoid\\" An elementary treatise on cubic and quartic curves Alfred Barnard Basset (1901) Cambridge pp. 85ff Category:Algebraic curves Category:Articles containing proofs Category:Roulettes (curve) ","title":"Cissoid of Diocles"},{"id":"820079","text":":The City in the Sea is also the title of a science fiction novel by Wilson Tucker Publication with \\"Annabel Lee\\" in The Poets and Poetry of America, Philadelphia, Carey and Hart, 1850.\\"The City in the Sea\\" is a poem by Edgar Allan Poe. The final version was published in 1845, but an earlier version was published as \\"The Doomed City\\" in 1831 and, later, as \\"The City of Sin\\". The poem tells the story of a city ruled by a personification of Death using common elements from Gothic fiction. The poem appeared in the Southern Literary Messenger, The American Review, the Broadway Journal, as well as in the 1850 collection The Poets and Poetry of America. Poe drew his inspiration from several works, including Kubla Khan by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. ==Analysis== The city is one in the west ruled by Death who is revered above all: ‚ÄòWhile from a proud tower in the town, Death looks gigantically down.‚Äô This is another classic Poe poem in that it deals with death and presents it in a non-conventional way. It is seen as a god that rules over a glorious, peaceful city in the west. There are ‚ÄòDomes and spires and kingly halls, and fanes and Babylon like walls‚Ä¶‚Äô That the city is in the west is appropriate, because the west, in which the sun sets, has traditionally been associated with death. At the end of the poem a ‚Äòstir in the air‚Äô or a wave moves the towers so that they create ‚ÄòA void within the filmy heaven.‚Äô Poe speaks in the last part of the poem of the end of days when ‚Äòthe waves now have a redder glow, the hours are breathing faint and low.‚Äô The waves turning red is a sign of hell's coming, because red is the color of fire and hence the color of hell and the devil. ‚ÄòAnd when, amid no earthly moans, Down, down the town shall settle hence, Hell rising from a thousand thrones, shall do it reverence.‚Äô The last lines of the poem speak of the devil's gratitude to death in allowing him to come forth and rule over Earth. In addition, the end suggests that this city is more evil than Hell for it will hold the city of Death in reverence. It is suggested, that Death may be worse than the Devil.

Mitchell studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1849 at the age of 18. When the American Civil War began, Mitchell resigned from his post as Florida Attorney General and enlisted in the Confederate States Army. Mitchell was such a strong supporter of Southern nationalism that he had two members of his Masonic lodge expelled for fighting in the Union Army. In July 1863, Mitchell left the Confederate Army to take a seat in the Florida House of Representatives, to which he had been elected while serving. He was reelected after the war, in 1873 and 1875. His brother Charles Mitchell later became the Florida Commissioner of Land and Immigration, the modern equivalent of the Commissioner of Agriculture. In 1888, Mitchell was appointed to the Florida Supreme Court, serving as an associate justice until 1891, when he resigned to start campaigning for governor. He won the election. During his term as governor, Mitchell was paid $3500 per year. After he left office, Mitchell returned to Hillsborough County, where he was elected as clerk of the circuit court and subsequently county treasurer there. He died in Tampa on October 14, 1903 and was buried at Oaklawn Cemetery.

After military service there he was rotated to Lae, Morobe, Igam Barracks Joint Officer Service College where he trained as a commissioned officer. Singirok trained and lectured in Duntroon military academy in Australia on Land Warfare Tactics in Military Science before being requested back to the PNGDF on strict orders during the height of the sandline crisis with the rank of Captain. In the mid-1990s, he was promoted to Brigadier-General, and given the rank of commander.He was later promoted to the rank of Major-General of the PNGDF in the late 1990s during his second stint as commander. In 1996, Tim Spicer, an ex-Colonel in the Scots Guards, who had recently founded the mercenary firm Sandline International, met with Singirok. Spicer attempted to persuade Singirok to support a package of military support that Spicer had negotiated with then-defence minister Mathias Ijape. Singirok declined, but the deal went ahead anyway, with the support of Ijape, Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan and Deputy Prime Minister Chris Haiveta. It is unclear just how much Singirok knew of the events in between that meeting and the leaking of the affair to the international media on 10 February 1997. When the story broke in The Australian newspaper, Singirok was in the Philippines, and the mercenaries were already in Port Moresby. When he returned on 27 February, his mind was made up. He condemned the government for leaving him, as head of the PNGDF, out of the loop, and condemned Spicer for having more access to the government than he did. Over the next week, he made plans for Operation Rausim Kwik (Tok Pisin for 'get rid of them fast'). On 8 March, he asked Major Walter Enuma to command the operation. Enuma agreed. ==Sandline affair== On the night of 16 March, Singirok's soldiers swooped. They arrested Spicer, the mercenaries, and their support staff. The next morning, Singirok went on national radio, and accused Prime Minister Chan, Defence Minister Ijape, and Deputy Prime Minister Haiveta of corruption, and gave them 48 hours to resign. He also fiercely denied allegations that he was aiming to take power himself. Chan refused to resign, and the same day, sacked Singirok as Commander of the PNGDF, replacing him with the controversial Colonel Alfred Aikung. That was the end of Singirok's direct role in the crisis that followed. However, Enuma carried out Singirok's plans in his absence. In the days that followed, the mercenaries were deported, the parliament was surrounded, and Chan, Ijape and Haiveta were all forced to stand down. Following Sir Julius Chan's decision to stand down, Singirok went public with several serious corruption allegations against Chan's government. Chan stood again at the following election, but in the wake of the affair and Singirok's allegations, not only lost power, but also his seat in parliament. ==Dismissal and subsequent inquiry== Following the affair, Singirok was dismissed from his position. He faced several inquiries into the events. He was subsequently reappointed in 1998, but dismissed again in 2000 over the same events, after another inquiry. The 2000 inquiry found Singirok guilty of secretly receiving $US52,000 through his Visa card account in the London-based Lloyds Bank. He was also found guilty of failing to obtain exemption from the Ombudsman Commission of the payments he received. Singirok also faced criminal sedition charges, stemming from his radio broadcast of 17 March 1997, stating that he had launched a military revolt to get the mercenaries out of the country. Finally, in March 2004, he was cleared of all other charges. In recent times, he has spoken out against Australian intervention in the Pacific, particularly the deployment of forces to the Solomon Islands, accusing the country of imperialism. He has also suggested that Papua New Guinea risks becoming a failed state. ==Legacy== Though his name has been sullied somewhat by the bribery allegations, many still accredit Singirok with the end of the Bougainvillean war, which occurred soon after the ousting of the Chan government. In a June 2004 interview with the Port Moresby newspaper The National, he stated \\"Even to this day, I believe strongly as a professional military officer that there was no military solution to bring an end to the civil war on Bougainville.\\" Singirok now operates a taxi company & security firm in Port Moresby. He has suggested that after taking a break, he may return to public life. He stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in the 2007 general election, in the Sumkar constituency in Madang Province, where he was defeated by Ken Fairweather.\\"Triumphant Somare\\", Islands Business ==References== Category:Living people Category:Papua New Guinean military personnel Category:Commanders of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force Category:1956 births ","title":"Jerry Singirok"},{"id":"820136","text":"A street in Little Five Points Hallowe'en Parade The Vortex restaurant A mural in Little Five Points Junkman's Daughter novelty shop A new age shop in Little Five Points Little Five Points (also L5P or LFP or Little Five or Lil' Five) is a district on the east side of Atlanta, Georgia, United States, east of downtown.

Two points are provided by Euclid Avenue, which runs northeast/southwest. The fifth point was originally Seminole Avenue, which met the intersection from the northwest, but the Seminole point was converted to a plaza and there is no longer a five- point intersection, though some regard McLendon Avenue, extending east from Euclid's southern intersection at Moreland, as the new fifth point. ==History== The first Atlanta streetcars were constructed just south of the Little Five Points in the 1890s. According to the National Park Service, as the population grew on Atlanta's east side, the area where the trolley lines converged became one of the earliest major regional shopping centers. Little Five Points thrived until the 1960s, when a proposed freeway through the heart of the district drove residents out of the neighborhood.Little Five Points in Fulton County (30307) ajchomefinder. By the 1970s, Little Five Points had fallen into disrepair. A revitalization began as urban pioneers moved into the then-cheap neighborhood and restored the Victorian-style homes. By 1981, local merchants formed the Little Five Points Partnership to continue the restoration and expansion of the retail area, turning what was formerly a gas station into the \\"484 retail area\\" ‚Äî several retail shops aligned in strip- mall style.Little Five Points: Atlanta's Alternative Neighborhood city- data.com. ==Geography== Little Five Points is surrounded by the Inman Park, Edgewood, Candler Park and Poncey-Highland neighborhoods of Atlanta.

Pope Francis announced his canonization on 17 December 2013. ==LifeEarly life=== Faber was born in 1506 to a peasant family in the village of Villaret, in the Duchy of Savoy (now Saint-Jean-de-Sixt in the French Department of Haute-Savoie). As a boy, he was a shepherd in the high pastures of the French Alps. He had little education, but a remarkable memory; he could hear a sermon in the morning and then repeat it verbatim in the afternoon for his friends. Two of his uncles were Carthusian priors. At first, he was entrusted to the care of a priest at Th√¥nes and later to a school in the neighboring village of La Roche-sur-Foron. In 1525, Faber went to Paris to pursue his studies. He was admitted to the Coll√®ge Sainte-Barbe, the oldest school in the University of Paris, where he shared his lodgings with Francis Xavier. There Faber's spiritual views began to develop, influenced by a combination of popular devotion, Christian humanism, and late medieval scholasticism. Faber and Xavier became close friends and both received the degree of Master of Arts on the same day in 1530. At the university, Faber also met Ignatius of Loyola and became one of his associates. He tutored Loyola in the philosophy of Aristotle, while Loyola tutored Faber in spiritual matters. Faber wrote of Loyola's counsel: \\"He gave me an understanding of my conscience and of the temptations and scruples I have had for so long without either understanding them or seeing the way by which I would be able to get peace.\\" Xavier, Faber, and Loyola all became roommates at the University of Paris and are all recognized by the Jesuits as founders of the Society of Jesus. ===Jesuit preacher=== Saint Peter Faber, S.J. Faber was the first among the small circle of men who formed the Society of Jesus to be ordained. Having become a priest on 30 May 1534, he received the religious vows of Ignatius and his five companions at Montmartre on 15 August.Michael Servetus Research Website that includes graphical documents in the University of Paris of: Ignatius of Loyola, Francis Xavier, Alfonso Salmer√≥n, Nicholas Bobadilla, Peter Faber and Simao Rodrigues, as well as Michael de Villanueva (\\"Servetus\\") Upon graduation, Loyola returned to Spain for a period of convalescence, after instructing his companions to meet in Venice and charging Faber with conducting them there. After Loyola himself, Faber was the one whom Xavier and his companions esteemed the most. Leaving Paris on 15 November 1536, Faber and his companions rejoined Loyola at Venice in January 1537. When war between Venice and the Turks prevented them from evangelizing the Holy Land as they planned, they decided to form the community that became the Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuit Order. The group then traveled to Rome where they put themselves at the disposal of Pope Paul III. After Faber spent some months preaching and teaching, the Pope sent him to Parma and Piacenza, where he brought about a revival of Christian piety. Recalled to Rome in 1540, Faber was sent to Germany to uphold the position of the Catholic Church at the Diet of Worms and then at the Diet of Ratisbon in 1541. Another Catholic theologian, Johann Cochlaeus, reported that Faber avoided theological debate and emphasized personal reformation, calling him \\"a master of the life of the affections\\". Faber was startled by the unrest that the Protestant movement had stirred up in Germany and by the decadence he found in the Catholic hierarchy. He decided that the remedy did not lie in discussions with the Protestants but in the reform of the Roman Catholic, especially of the clergy. For ten months, at Speyer, at Ratisbon, and at Mainz, he conducted himself with gentleness with all those with whom he dealt. He influenced princes, prelates, and priests who opened themselves to him and amazed people by the effectiveness of his outreach. Faber possessed the gift of friendship to a remarkable degree. He was famous not for his preaching, but for his engaging conversations and his guidance of souls. He crisscrossed Europe on foot, guiding bishops, priests, nobles, and common people alike in the Spiritual Exercises. As a lone Jesuit often on the move, Faber never felt alone because he walked in a world whose denizens included saints and angels. He would ask the saint of the day and all the saints \\"to obtain for us not only virtues and salvation for our spirits but in particular whatever can strengthen, heal, and preserve the body and each of its parts\\". His guardian angel, above all, became his chief ally. He sought support from the saints and angels both for his personal sanctification and in his evangelization of communities. Whenever he entered a new town or region, Faber implored the aid of the particular angels and saints associated with that place. Through the intercession of his allies, Faber could enter even a potentially hostile region assured of a spiritual army at his side. As he desired to bring each person he met to a closer relationship through spiritual friendship and conversation, he would invoke the intercession of the person‚Äôs guardian angel. Called to Spain by Loyola, he visited Barcelona, Zaragoza, Medinaceli, Madrid, and Toledo. In January 1542 the pope ordered him to Germany again. For the next nineteen months, Faber worked for the reform of Speyer, Mainz, and Cologne. The Archbishop of Cologne, Hermann of Wied, favored Lutheranism, which he later publicly embraced. Faber gradually gained the confidence of the clergy and recruited many young men to the Jesuits, among them Peter Canisius. After spending some months at Leuven in 1543, where he implanted the seeds of numerous vocations among the young, he returned to Cologne. Between 1544 and 1546, Faber continued his work in Portugal and Spain. Through his influence while at the royal court of Lisbon, Faber was instrumental in establishing the Society of Jesus in Portugal. There and in Spain, he was a fervent and effective preacher. He was called to preach in the principal cities of Spain, where he aroused fervor among the local populations and fostered vocations to the clergy. Among them there was Francis Borgia, another significant future Jesuit. King John III of Portugal wanted Faber made Patriarch of Ethiopia. Sim√£o Rodrigues, co-founder of the Jesuit order, wrote that Faber was \\"endowed with charming grace in dealing with people, which up to now I must confess I have not seen in anyone else. Somehow he entered into friendship in such a way, bit by bit coming to influence others in such a manner, that his very way of living and gracious conversation powerfully drew to the love of God all those with whom he dealt.\\" He then worked in several Spanish cities, including Valladolid, Salamanca, Toledo, Galapagar, Alcal√°, and Madrid. ===Death=== In 1546, Faber was appointed by Pope Paul III to act as a peritus (expert) on behalf of the Holy See at the Council of Trent. Faber, at age 40, was exhausted by his incessant efforts and his unceasing journeys, always made on foot. In April 1546, he left Spain to attend the Council and reached Rome, weakened by fever, on 17 July 1546. He died, reportedly in the arms of Loyola, on 1 August 1546.Favre, Pierre Manus online Faber's body was initially buried at the Church of Our Lady of the Way, which served as a center for the Jesuit community. When that church was demolished to allow for the construction of the Church of the Ges√π, his remains and those of others among the first Jesuits were exhumed. His are now in the crypt near the entrance to the Ges√π. ==Writings== Faber kept a diary of his spiritual life known as his Memoriale. Most of it dates from June 1542 to July 1543, with some additional entries from 1545 and a final brief entry made in January 1546. It begins with a quotation from Psalms: \\"Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits.\\" It takes the form of a series of conversations, mostly between God and Faber with occasional contributions on the part of various saints and Faber's colleagues. Peter Faber authored \\"The Blessed Sacrament\\" which proffers a convincing argument for the existence and nature of God. ==Veneration== Those who had known Faber in life already invoked him as a saint. Saint Francis de Sales, whose character recalled that of Faber's, never spoke of him except as a saint. He is remembered for his travels through Europe promoting Catholic renewal and his great skill in directing the Spiritual Exercises. Faber was beatified on 5 September 1872. His feast day is celebrated on 2 August by the Society of Jesus. Faber was honored as part of the 2006 Jesuit Jubilee Year which celebrated the 500th anniversary of the birth of Francis Xavier, the 500th anniversary of the birth of Peter Faber, and the 450th anniversary of the death of Ignatius Loyola. Pope Francis, on his own 77th birthday, 17 December 2013, announced Faber's canonization. He used a process known as equipollent canonization that dispenses with the standard judicial procedures and ceremonies in the case of someone long venerated. Faber is regarded as one of Pope Francis' favorite saints. A few weeks earlier, Francis had praised Faber's \\"dialogue with all, even the most remote and even with his opponents; his simple piety, a certain na√Øvet√© perhaps, his being available straightaway, his careful interior discernment, the fact that he was a man capable of great and strong decisions but also capable of being so gentle and loving.\\" Francis also gave thanks for Faber's canonization when he celebrated Mass on 3 January 2014, at the Church of the Ges√π. ==Legacy== The Saint Peter Faber Jesuit Community at Boston College is a residence for priests in formation. Creighton University confers the Blessed Peter Faber Integrity Award on a student, faculty or staff member who is involved in activities that promote integrity, social justice, peace, and religious, racial, and cultural harmony and is able to inspire and lead others to distill their values and integrity. Saint Peter Faber House at Gonzaga University is an extension of the University Ministry office reserved for preparing retreats and further developing University Ministry programs. The Faber Center for Ignatian Spirituality was adopted as a ministry of Marquette University in November 2005. The St. Peter Faber conference room in Loyola Hall at Manresa House of Retreats, Convent, Louisiana, is the location where men on retreat are directed through the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of LoyolaSpiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola The School of Business at Australian Catholic University is known as the Peter Faber School of Business. Faber Hall at Fordham University in the Bronx, New York, is a residence hall and administrative building.

He studied literature and philosophy at Alcal√° and then philosophy and theology at the Sorbonne in Paris. Here, through Diego Laynez, he met St. Ignatius of Loyola and with Laynez, St. Peter Faber and St. Francis Xavier, he enlisted as one of the first companions of Loyola in 1534.Michael Servetus Research Website that includes graphical documents in the University of Paris of: Ignatius of Loyola, Francis Xavier, Alfonso Salmer√≥n, Nicholas Bobadilla, Peter Faber and Simao Rodrigues, as well as Michael de Villanueva (\\"Servetus\\") The small company left Paris on 15 November 1536, reached Venice on 8 January 1537 and during Lent of that year went to Rome. He delivered a discourse before the Pope and was, in return, granted leave to receive Holy orders so soon as he reached canonical age. About 8 September, all the first companions met at Vicenza and all, save St. Ignatius, said their first Mass. The plan of a pilgrimage to the Holy Land was abandoned. Salmeron devoted his ministry in Sienna to the poor and to children. On 22 April 1541, he pronounced his solemn vows in St. Paul's-Outside-the-Walls basilica as a professed member of the newly established Society of Jesus. In the autumn of 1541 Pope Paul III sent Salmeron and Paschase Bro√´t as Apostolic nuncios to Ireland. They landed by way of Scotland on 23 February 1542. Thirty-four days later they set sail for Dieppe and went on to Paris. For two years Salmeron preached in Rome; his exposition of the Pauline Epistle to the Ephesians thrice a week in the church of the Society effected much good (1545). After preaching during Lent at Bologna, he went with Diego Laynez to the Council of Trent (18 May 1546) as theologian to Paul III. The Dogma of Justification was under discussion. The two Jesuits at once reportedly won the hearts and respect of all; their discourses had to be printed and distributed to the bishops. Both set out for Bologna (14 March 1547) with the Council. After serious sickness at Padua, Salmeron once again took up his council work. The next two years were in great part spent in preaching at Bologna, Venice, Padua and Verona. On 4 October 1549, Salmeron and his companions, Claude Le Jay and Peter Canisius, took their doctorate at the University of Bologna, so that they might, at the urgent invitation of William IV of Bavaria, accept chairs in Ingolstadt. Salmeron undertook to interpret the Pauline Epistle to the Romans. Upon the death of Duke William, at the instigation of the Bishop of Verona, much to the chagrin of the faculty of the Academy of Ingolstadt, Salmeron was returned to Verona (24 September 1550). That year he explained the Gospel of St. Matthew. In 1551 he was summoned to Rome to help St. Ignatius in working up the Constitutions (statutes) of the Jesuit Society. Other work was in store. He was soon (February, 1551) sent down to Naples to inaugurate the Society's first college there, but after a few months was summoned by Ignatius to go back to the Council of Trent as theologian to pope Julius III. It was during the discussions preliminary to these sessions that Laynez and Salmeron, as papal theologians, gave their vota first. When the Council once again suspended its sessions, Salmeron returned to Naples (October, 1552). Pope Paul IV sent him to the Augsburg Diet (May, 1555) with nuncio Lippomanus, and thence into Poland and in April, 1556 to Belgium. Another journey to Belgium was undertaken in the capacity of adviser to Cardinal Giovanni Pietro Caraffa (2 December 1557). Laynez appointed Salmeron first Jesuit Provincial of Naples in 1558 and vicar-general in 1561 during the former's apostolic legation to France. The Council of Trent was again resumed (May, 1562) and a third pontiff, Pius IV, chose Salmeron and Laynez for papal theologians. The subject to be discussed was very delicate: the Divine origin of the rights and duties of bishops. During the years 1564-82, Salmeron was engaged chiefly in preaching and writing; he preached every day during eighteen Lenten seasons; his preaching was fervent, learned and fruitful. His writings during this long period were voluminous; Saint Robert Bellarmine spent five months in Naples reviewing them; each day he pointed out to Salmeron the portions that were not up to the mark, and the next day the latter brought back those parts corrected. He died at Naples on 13 February 1585. ==Works== The chief writings of Salmeron are his sixteen volumes of Scriptural commentaries: eleven on the Gospels, one on the Acts, and four on the Pauline Epistles. Southwell says that these sixteen volumes were printed by Sanchez, Madrid, from 1597 till 1602; in Brescia, 1601; in Cologne, from 1602‚Äì04, Sommervogel (Biblioth√®que de la C. de J., VII, 479) has traced only twelve tomes of the Madrid edition - the eleven of the Gospels and one of the Pauline commentaries. The Gospel volumes are entitled, Alfonsi Salmeronis Toletani, e Societate Jusu Theologi, Commentarii in Evangelicam Historiam et in Acta Apostolorum, in duodecim tomos distributi (Madrid, 1598‚Äì1601). The first Cologne edition, together with the second (1612‚Äì15), are found complete. These voluminous commentaries are the popular and university expositions which Salmeron had delivered during his preaching and teaching days. In old age, he gathered his notes together, revised them, and left his volumes ready for posthumous publication by Bartholomew P√©rez de Nueros. Hartmann Grisar (Jacobi Lainez Disputationes Tridentinae, I, 53) thinks that the commentary on Acts is the work of Perez; Braunsberger (Canisii epist., III, 448) and the editors of Monumenta Historica S. J. (Epistolae Salmeron, I, xxx) disagree with Grisar. He was noted for his devotion to the Church, his fortitude, prudence, and magnanimity. The Acts of the Council of Trent show that he wielded tremendous influence there by his vota on issues including justification, Holy Eucharist, penance, purgatory, indulgences, the Sacrifice of the Mass, matrimony and the origin of episcopal jurisdiction. ==References== ;Attribution * Category:1515 births Category:1585 deaths Category:University of Paris alumni Category:University of Bologna alumni Category:Spanish Jesuits Category:Spanish Roman Catholic priests Category:Spanish biblical scholars Category:16th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:16th-century Spanish people Category:Participants in the Council of Trent Category:16th-century Spanish theologians ","title":"Alfonso Salmeron"},{"id":"820170","text":"Fresco of Approving of bylaw of Society of Jesus depicting Ignatius of Loyola receiving the papal bull Regimini militantis Ecclesiae from Pope Paul III.

Regimini militantis Ecclesiae (Latin for To the Government of the Church Militant) was the papal bull promulgated by Pope Paul III on September 27, 1540, which gave a first approval to the Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuits, but limited the number of its members to sixty. ==History== Ignatius of Loyola and his companions had made their way to Rome in October 1538, to offer their priestly services to the pope. As they were about to be dispersed by the various missions given them by the pope, the question arose as to whether they wished to remain spiritually \\"one\\". After prayer and discussion they decided positively: since Christ had brought them together, they felt it was His will they remain united.

The papal text of 1540 included what is known as the Formula Instituti.

This first General Congregation also elected his successor. ==Text== Regimini militantis Ecclesiae reflects the first Jesuits' vision of themselves, approved by the pope.

Bridgeheads typically exist for only a few days, the invading forces either being thrown back or expanding the bridgehead to create a secure defensive lodgement area, before breaking out into enemy territory, such as when the U.S. 9th Armored Division seized the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen in 1945 during World War II. In some cases a bridgehead may exist for months. ==Etymology== Huningue's former fortifications. Built by Vauban (1679‚Äì1681) with a bridge and bridgehead across the Rhine. It was demolished under the terms of Article III of the Treaty of Paris (1815). Bridgehead (French t√™te de pont) is a High Middle Ages military term, which before the invention of cannons meant the military fortification that protects the end of a bridge. Like many older terms, the meaning of the word drifted with the passage of time, becoming used for something not exactly true to its initial usage. With the introduction of cannons, the term was morphed to a generalized term for field fortifications lying some distance beyond the ends of the bridge that were emplaced to protect both the bridge and any troops crossing it to the far bank, so became in that era a term used when referring to both the fortifications and the small lodgement on the bank that was closest to the enemy. As the process of moving an army over bridges is slow and complicated, it is usually necessary to secure it from hostile interruption, and the works constituting the bridge-head must therefore be sufficiently far advanced to keep the enemy's artillery out of range of the bridges‚Äîhence as artillery grew in power, so did the size of the lodgements necessary. In addition, room is required for the troops to form up on the farther bank. Formerly, with short- range weapons, a bridgehead was often little more than a screen for the bridge itself, but modern conditions have rendered necessary far greater extensions of bridge defenses. Then armies and military formations grew, so needed more lodgement area to organize a force large enough to stage a break out against a determined enemy, and again the technical meaning of the term expanded, again referring to a large fortified area about at bridge end. With the advent of modern warfare capabilities, including long-range tube artillery and high- powered rifles with effective ranges measured in the thousands of yards (metres), the term of art again had to expand in area, but now morphed to be just an area defended and controlled by ample firepower, with or without constructed fortifications. The term in colloquial usage refers to any kind of defended area that is extended into hostile territory ‚Äì also called a foothold and sometimes the technically incorrect 'beachhead', which is frequently mistaken colloquially as synonymous terminology. The technical term refers in particular to the specific area on the far side of a defended river bank or a segment of a lake or riverine coastline held by the enemy forces, such as the Bridge at Remagen. The term is especially applied when such a territory is initially seized by an amphibious assault with the tactical intent of establishing a supply line across the geographic barrier feature to allow further operational manoeuvring. In that sense, it has much in common with the popular misconception of a beachhead. ==See also== * Airhead (warfare) * Beachhead * Lodgement ==References== ==External links== * Category:Military geography Category:Military terminology ","title":"Bridgehead"},{"id":"820248","text":"Ocean floor disposal is a method of sequestering radioactive waste in ocean floor sediment where it is unlikely to be disturbed either geologically or by human activity. Several methods of depositing material in the ocean floor have been proposed, including encasing it in concrete and as the United Kingdom has previously done, dropping it in torpedoes designed to increase the depth of penetration into the ocean floor, or depositing containers in shafts drilled with techniques similar to those used in oil exploration. Ocean floor sediment is saturated with water, but since there is no water table per se and the water does not flow through it the migration of dissolved waste is limited to the rate at which it can diffuse through dense clay. This is slow enough that it could potentially take millions of years for waste to diffuse through several tens of meters of sediment so that by the time it reaches open ocean it would be highly dilute and decayed. Large regions of the ocean floor are thought to be completely geologically inactive and it is not expected that there will be extensive human activity there in the future. Water absorbs essentially all radiation within a few meters provided the waste remains contained. One of the problems associated with this option includes the difficulty of recovering the waste, if necessary, once it is emplaced deep in the ocean. Also, establishing an effective international structure to develop, regulate, and monitor a sub-seabed repository would be extremely difficult. Beyond technical and political considerations, the London Convention places prohibitions on disposing of radioactive materials at sea and does not make a distinction between waste dumped directly into the water and waste that is buried underneath the ocean's floor. It remained in force until 2018, after which the sub-seabed disposal option can be revisited at 25-year intervals. Depositing waste, in suitable containers, in subduction zones has also been suggested. Here, waste would be transported by plate tectonic movement into the Earth's mantle and rendered harmless through dilution and natural decay. Several objections have been raised to this method, including vulnerabilities during transport and disposal, as well as uncertainties in the actual tectonic processes. http://www.nwmo.ca/uploads_managed/MediaFiles/1287_baird- submissiononthetopic_cho.pdf ==See also== *Horizontal drillhole disposal *Ocean disposal of radioactive waste * Deep borehole disposal * Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository * Waste Isolation Pilot Plant * Nuclear fuel cycle * Radioactive waste == References == Category:Radioactive waste Category:Waste treatment technology Category:Ocean pollution ","title":"Ocean floor disposal"},{"id":"820253","text":"In physics and mathematics, in the area of vector calculus, Helmholtz's theorem,On Helmholtz's Theorem in Finite Regions.

Chelsea Publishing Company, 1922. states that any sufficiently smooth, rapidly decaying vector field in three dimensions can be resolved into the sum of an irrotational (curl-free) vector field and a solenoidal (divergence-free) vector field; this is known as the Helmholtz decomposition or Helmholtz representation. It is named after Hermann von Helmholtz.See: * H. Helmholtz (1858) \\"√úber Integrale der hydrodynamischen Gleichungen, welcher der Wirbelbewegungen entsprechen\\" (On integrals of the hydrodynamic equations which correspond to vortex motions), Journal f√ºr die reine und angewandte Mathematik, 55: 25‚Äì55. On page 38, the components of the fluid's velocity (u, v, w) are expressed in terms of the gradient of a scalar potential P and the curl of a vector potential (L, M, N). * However, Helmholtz was largely anticipated by George Stokes in his paper: G. G. Stokes (presented: 1849; published: 1856) \\"On the dynamical theory of diffraction,\\" Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, vol. 9, part I, pages 1‚Äì62; see pages 9‚Äì10. As an irrotational vector field has a scalar potential and a solenoidal vector field has a vector potential, the Helmholtz decomposition states that a vector field (satisfying appropriate smoothness and decay conditions) can be decomposed as the sum of the form - abla \\\\phi + abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{A}, where \\\\phi is a scalar field called \\"scalar potential\\", and is a vector field, called a vector potential. ==Statement of the theorem== Let \\\\mathbf{F} be a vector field on a bounded domain V\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}^3, which is twice continuously differentiable, and let S be the surface that encloses the domain V. Then \\\\mathbf{F} can be decomposed into a curl-free component and a divergence-free component: :\\\\mathbf{F}=- abla \\\\Phi+ abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{A}, where : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{r}) & =\\\\frac 1 {4\\\\pi} \\\\int_V \\\\frac{ abla'\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{F} (\\\\mathbf{r}')}{\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}'} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}V' -\\\\frac 1 {4\\\\pi} \\\\oint_S \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}}' \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{F} (\\\\mathbf{r}')}{\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}'} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}S' \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] \\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{r}) & =\\\\frac 1 {4\\\\pi} \\\\int_V \\\\frac{ abla' \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{r}')}{\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}'} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}V' -\\\\frac 1 {4\\\\pi} \\\\oint_S \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{n}}'\\\\times\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{F} (\\\\mathbf{r}')}{\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}'} \\\\, \\\\mathrm{d}S' \\\\end{align} and abla' is the nabla operator with respect to \\\\mathbf{r'}, not \\\\mathbf{r} .

For higher dimensional generalization, see the discussion of Hodge decomposition below. ===Another derivation from the Fourier transform=== Note that in the theorem stated here, we have imposed the condition that if \\\\mathbf{F} is not defined on a bounded domain, then \\\\mathbf{F} shall decay faster than 1/r. Thus, the Fourier Transform of \\\\mathbf{F}, denoted as \\\\mathbf{G}, is guaranteed to exist. We apply the convention :\\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\iiint \\\\mathbf{G}(\\\\mathbf{k}) e^{i\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r}} dV_k The Fourier transform of a scalar field is a scalar field, and the Fourier transform of a vector field is a vector field of same dimension. Now consider the following scalar and vector fields: :\\\\begin{align} G_\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{k}) &= i \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{G}(\\\\mathbf{k})}{\\\\\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{k}) &= i \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{k} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{G}(\\\\mathbf{k})}{\\\\\\\\mathbf{k}\\\\^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ [8pt] \\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{r}) &= \\\\iiint G_\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{k}) e^{i \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r}} dV_k \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{r}) &= \\\\iiint \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{k}) e^{i \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r}} dV_k \\\\end{align} Hence :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{G}(\\\\mathbf{k}) &= - i \\\\mathbf{k} G_\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{k}) + i \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{k}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ [6pt] \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{r}) &= -\\\\iiint i \\\\mathbf{k} G_\\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{k}) e^{i \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r}} dV_k + \\\\iiint i \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{G}_\\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{k}) e^{i \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r}} dV_k \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= - abla \\\\Phi(\\\\mathbf{r}) + abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{A}(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\end{align} ==Fields with prescribed divergence and curl== The term \\"Helmholtz theorem\\" can also refer to the following. Let be a solenoidal vector field and d a scalar field on which are sufficiently smooth and which vanish faster than at infinity. Then there exists a vector field such that : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F} = d \\\\quad \\\\text{ and } \\\\quad abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F} = \\\\mathbf{C}; if additionally the vector field vanishes as , then is unique. In other words, a vector field can be constructed with both a specified divergence and a specified curl, and if it also vanishes at infinity, it is uniquely specified by its divergence and curl. This theorem is of great importance in electrostatics, since Maxwell's equations for the electric and magnetic fields in the static case are of exactly this type. The proof is by a construction generalizing the one given above: we set : \\\\mathbf{F} = - abla(\\\\mathcal{G} (d)) + abla \\\\times (\\\\mathcal{G}(\\\\mathbf{C})), where \\\\mathcal{G} represents the Newtonian potential operator. (When acting on a vector field, such as , it is defined to act on each component.) ==Differential forms== The Hodge decomposition is closely related to the Helmholtz decomposition, generalizing from vector fields on R3 to differential forms on a Riemannian manifold M. Most formulations of the Hodge decomposition require M to be compact. Since this is not true of R3, the Hodge decomposition theorem is not strictly a generalization of the Helmholtz theorem. However, the compactness restriction in the usual formulation of the Hodge decomposition can be replaced by suitable decay assumptions at infinity on the differential forms involved, giving a proper generalization of the Helmholtz theorem. ==Weak formulation== The Helmholtz decomposition can also be generalized by reducing the regularity assumptions (the need for the existence of strong derivatives). Suppose is a bounded, simply-connected, Lipschitz domain. Every square-integrable vector field has an orthogonal decomposition: :\\\\mathbf{u}= abla\\\\varphi+ abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{A} where is in the Sobolev space of square-integrable functions on whose partial derivatives defined in the distribution sense are square integrable, and , the Sobolev space of vector fields consisting of square integrable vector fields with square integrable curl. For a slightly smoother vector field , a similar decomposition holds: :\\\\mathbf{u}= abla\\\\varphi+\\\\mathbf{v} where . ==Longitudinal and transverse fields== A terminology often used in physics refers to the curl-free component of a vector field as the longitudinal component and the divergence-free component as the transverse component.Stewart, A. M.; Longitudinal and transverse components of a vector field, Sri Lankan Journal of Physics 12, 33‚Äì42 (2011) This terminology comes from the following construction: Compute the three-dimensional Fourier transform \\\\hat\\\\mathbf{F} of the vector field \\\\mathbf{F}. Then decompose this field, at each point k, into two components, one of which points longitudinally, i.e. parallel to k, the other of which points in the transverse direction, i.e. perpendicular to k. So far, we have : \\\\hat\\\\mathbf{F} (\\\\mathbf{k}) = \\\\hat\\\\mathbf{F}_t (\\\\mathbf{k}) + \\\\hat\\\\mathbf{F}_l (\\\\mathbf{k}) : \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\cdot \\\\hat\\\\mathbf{F}_t(\\\\mathbf{k}) = 0. : \\\\mathbf{k} \\\\times \\\\hat\\\\mathbf{F}_l(\\\\mathbf{k}) = \\\\mathbf{0}. Now we apply an inverse Fourier transform to each of these components. Using properties of Fourier transforms, we derive: : \\\\mathbf{F}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\mathbf{F}_t(\\\\mathbf{r})+\\\\mathbf{F}_l(\\\\mathbf{r}) : abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{F}_t (\\\\mathbf{r}) = 0 : abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{F}_l (\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\mathbf{0} Since abla\\\\times( abla\\\\Phi)=0 and abla\\\\cdot( abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{A})=0, we can get :\\\\mathbf{F}_t= abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{A}=\\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi} abla\\\\times\\\\int_V\\\\frac{ abla'\\\\times\\\\mathbf{F}}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}'\\\\right}\\\\mathrm{d}V' :\\\\mathbf{F}_l=- abla\\\\Phi=-\\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi} abla\\\\int_V\\\\frac{ abla'\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{F}}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}'\\\\right}\\\\mathrm{d}V' so this is indeed the Helmholtz decomposition.Online lecture notes by Robert Littlejohn ==See also== * Clebsch representation for a related decomposition of vector fields * Darwin Lagrangian for an application * Poloidal‚Äìtoroidal decomposition for a further decomposition of the divergence-free component abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{A} . * Scalar-vector-tensor decomposition ==Notes== ==ReferencesGeneral references=== * George B.

In 2006, the Island Corridor Foundation acquired the railway's ownership from the Canadian Pacific Railway and RailAmerica. Both freight service and the crown corporation Via Rail passenger service have been suspended indefinitely due to deferred maintenance on the rail line. ==HistoryVancouver Island joining Canada=== The history of an island railwayMacLachlin, p12-16 and a functioning island railway in perpetuity, started with the colony of Vancouver Island joining British Columbia in 1866, and the Canadian Confederation of 1867, and the incorporation of British Columbia into Canada in 1871. The terms of union required that within two years, the federal government was to start the construction of a railway from the \\"seaboard of British Columbia\\" joining the new province and Victoria with the railway system of Canada. On its part, British Columbia was to grant a band of public land of up to in width along either side of the railway line to the federal government for it to use in furtherance of the construction of the railway. The Pacific terminus of the railway was not specific but the proposed plan would have the railway cross the Rockies by the Yellowhead Pass and reach the BC coast at Bute Inlet. It would cross Sonora Island and Quadra Island and reach Vancouver Island by a bridge across Seymour Narrows. Through the influence of then BC Premier Amor de Cosmos, this plan was adopted by Order in Council by the federal government on 7 June 1873. Two shipments of rail were even delivered to Victoria from the United Kingdom. In 1873, Prime Minister of Canada Sir John A. Macdonald had stated that Esquimalt, British Columbia, the site of a naval base, would be the terminus of the \\"Pacific Railway\\". However, both the federal government and the Canadian Pacific Railway placed a low priority on construction of an island railway, as it had low traffic potential and would duplicate an existing steamer service. Port Alberni Station is today only used by the heritage Alberni Pacific Railway In 1874 British Columbia threatened to withdraw from Confederation and Premier Walkem petitioned the Queen for relief from these delays. Then Prime Minister Alexander Mackenzie and Walkem agreed to accept arbitration of the dispute by the Earl of Carnarvon, the Colonial Secretary. His award, given 17 November 1874 gave an extension of time for the construction and required that a railway be built from Esquimalt to Nanaimo. Despite the promises of both parties to be bound by his ruling, the federal government bill approving the award failed in the Senate of Canada. British Columbians were indignant and withdrawal from Confederation was raised again. In 1879 Lord Dufferin was sent to BC to assess the situation. His efforts produced no resolution. Governor General Dufferin arriving in Victoria had to take an alternate route rather than pass below an arch across the main street that bore a banner reading \\"Carnarvon Terms or Separation.\\"Carnarvon Terms - KnowBC - the leading source of BC information Walkem, although no longer premier, was sent to Ottawa to press for the Esquimalt to Nanaimo section. This issue was pressed again in 1880 by Amor de Cosmos and when that failed another petition to London was presented in 1881. The father of Canadian Confederation Sir John A. Macdonald in the House of Commons in 1881 gave a speech on the CPR and criticized Alexander Mackenzie for tinkering with the preconditions of British Columbia and Vancouver Island uniting with Canada.Read the ebook A history; British Columbia by R. E. (R. Edward) Gosnell The old chieftain said, \\"Both the Government of which I was the head and the Government of which he was the head were bound by the original resolutions.\\" Macdonald said,\\"It was admitted that it was a sacred obligation; it was admitted that there was a treaty made with British Columbia, with the people and the Government of British Columbia, and not only was it an agreement and a solemn bargain made between Canada and British Columbia, but it was formally sanctioned by Her Majesty's Government. It was a matter of Colonial policy and Imperial policy in England that the road should be constructed.\\"http://canadachannel.ca/HCO/index.php/John_A._Macdonald,_Speech_on_the_CPR ===The Land Grants=== Coal Baron Robert Dunsmuir Robert Dunsmuir, the Nanaimo coal baron and a member of the provincial legislature, was interested in owning the railway project and in the province's coal reserves. The fact that Dunsmuir was a member of the provincial government that was making the deal aroused some suspicion about corruption. Dunsmuir and three partners (Charles Crocker, Collis P. Huntington and Leland Stanford of California) incorporated the Esquimalt & Nanaimo Railway with Dunsmuir president and owner of one half of the shares. The company estimated that it would cost $1.5 million to construct. Dunsmuir planned to integrate the railway with the systems being built in Washington and Oregon with a ferry link from Victoria. Lewis M. ClementThe first Prime Minister gave British Columbia the choice of Dunsmuir or Lewis M. ClementLewis M. Clement of San Francisco, Chief Engineer of the Western Division of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, for the contract. Dusmuir travelled to Ottawa in 1882 with letters of introduction from John Hamilton Gray, one of the Fathers of Confederation and Joseph Trutch the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, both men in favour with Macdonald.Reksten, p 58. After a visit to Ottawa, to present himself directly for this project, Dunsmuir went off to Scotland. While in Scotland, Dunsmuir received the news that the provincial government had chosen the Vancouver Land and Railway Company controlled by Clement for the job. Dunsmuir was surprised that Clement would take the contract without a cash grant in addition to the land and commit to building the railway to Seymour Narrows, near Campbell River.Reksten p 59. When Clement and his company failed to come up with the necessary financial security, Macdonald quickly moved to accept Dunsmuir's terms.  Settler rights  The court ruled that this grant did not entitle the railway to dispossess existing settlers, the company applied for compensation and received a further grant of between Crown Mountain and Seymour Narrows. In 1883, the British Columbia provincial government signed a contract with Dunsmuir to build a railway between Esquimalt and Nanaimo in exchange for the same grant of land that Clement had negotiated, amounting to plus a cash grant of $750,000 from the federal government. Based on an average value of $10 per acre for the land the E&N; received, it cost the government $626,660 per mile to build the railway, which, when complete, was in private hands. The railway was given a massive amount of old-growth forests.MacLachlin, p 55. Proceeds from the land grants helped build Craigdarroch Castle. The grant amounted to almost 10% of Vancouver Island and included mineral rights and all known coal deposits. All the land grants to the E&N; railroad from 1884 to 1925 amounted to 20% of Vancouver Island.Taylor, WA. Crown Land Grants, A History of the E&N; Rail, 1975 The company was to receive a grant with the following boundaries: > :On the south by a straight line drawn from the head of Saanich Inlet to > Muir Creek, on the Straits of Fuca: :On the west, by a straight line drawn > from Muir Creek, aforesaid, to Crown Mountain: :On the north, by a straight > line drawn from Crown Mountain to Seymour Narrows: and :On the east, by the > coast line of Vancouver Island to the point of commencement.MacLachlin, p > 15. The grant was facilitated by BC's introduction of the Settlement Act (An Act relating to the Island Railway, the Graving Dock and the Railway Lands of the Province) in December 1883, in which surface rights of existing \\"squatters\\" were acknowledged and protected.Black, Kelly.

This cantilever suspension bridge was built in England in 1883 and first used in Canada crossing the Fraser River at Cisco where it became known as the Cisco Bridge. It was moved to Vancouver Island for the present crossing in 1910. The last spike was gold and the hammer was silver.The Last Spike On 13 August 1886, the last spike was driven at Cliffside, about north of Victoria. Construction of the island railway took three and a half years. Prime Minister Macdonald drove the last spike, during his only visit to British Columbia. The railway was extended to Dunsmuir's mine at Wellington in 1887, and into Victoria in 1888. It was extended west to Port Alberni in 1911, west to Lake Cowichan in 1912, and north to Courtenay in 1914. The E&N; Railway was to have been built all the way to Campbell River, but that plan fell through due to the outbreak of World War I. The present-day bridge north of Victoria, BC, over Niagara Creek Canyon (), formerly crossed the Fraser River at Cisco, BC, and was moved here ca.1910. The cantilever suspension bridge was pre-fabricated in England in 1883 and shipped to Canada.Turner, R. D.: West of the Great Divide, page 74. It replaced the original wooden trestle bridge, which was damaged in a washout on 12 November 1886.Cathedral Grove  British Columbia  Habitat Desecration ===The CPR years=== In 1905, Robert Dunsmuir‚Äôs son James sold the E&N; Railway to the Canadian Pacific Railway. The CPR built the railroad to Lake Cowichan, Port Alberni, Parksville, Qualicum Beach, and Courtenay. At its peak, the railroad had 45 stations on the main line, 36 stations on the Cowichan line, and 8 stations on the Port Alberni line.http://www.islandrail.ca/archives/history- of-the-en-railway/ Between 1905 and 1999, the E&N; Railway was owned and operated by the Canadian Pacific Railway. Via Rail took over operation of CPR's passenger train service, called The Malahat, in 1978, while CPR demarketed its freight operation, claiming that freight traffic was declining. In 1996, CPR reorganized the E&N; as an \\"internal short line\\" named E&N; Railfreight while the railbarge operations were sold to Seaspan Intermodal. In early 1999, shortline operator RailAmerica purchased the route from Nanaimo to Port Alberni, and leased the balance of the line. At that time, approximately 8,500 carloads of forest and paper products, minerals, and chemicals were transported by the Southern Vancouver Island Railway each year. ===RailAmerica=== A Budd RDC train operated by Via Rail at Qualicum Beach In 1998, CPR sold the middle part of the corridor to RailAmerica. Despite the purchase by RailAmerica, freight traffic continued to decline and the future of the E&N; was still in doubt. RailAmerica sought a sale for its acquisition due to unprofitably and deferred maintenance issues. Restrictions from Canadian Pacific on the lease/sale agreement, and major reconstruction of Highway 1 from Victoria to Nanaimo and the new freeway from Nanaimo to Campbell River, led to reduced driving times for the full length of the E&N.; This development also affected the privately owned rail line, which did not have the benefit of the provincial subsidies accorded to its competing highways. Freight traffic dropped to about 2000 carloads a year after the loss of their largest freight customer, a Catalyst Paper pulp mill in Port Alberni. RailAmerica ceased to operate the E&N; on 30 June 2006, with the Washington Group's Southern Railway of British Columbia taking over operations the following day under the name Southern Railway of Vancouver Island.  Pacific Wilderness tourist train  In the summers of 2000 and 2001, Ross Rowland managed on Vancouver Island the Pacific Wilderness Railway, which operated on the tracks of the E&N; Railway from Victoria, BC to the top of the nearby Malahat summit. The operation consisted of a few coach cars, which were moved through Esquimalt, View Royal and Langford by a couple of GP 20s, which would then make their way up to the top of the Malahat, before turning around and heading back to Victoria. Despite PAW's ad campaign promising grand views and stunning scenery, riders were often disappointed to discover that the views of Saanich Inlet were largely obscured by thick old growth forest along most of the route's right of way. Rowland attempted to remedy this situation by chopping down large portions of old growth trees along the Malahat portion of the right of way, but this only succeeded in incurring the wrath of area residents , without having much effect on the overall view. Questions were also raised about the Malahat being chosen as the northern terminus, due to its isolation . Apart from a crude shelter/platform that Rowland built in the wilderness with untreated lumber, the terminus lacked even basic service such as refreshments or washrooms. The nearest location that offered these services was a tiny gas station over 10 kilometres away. ===Via Rail=== In 1978, Via Rail assumed operational responsibility for the E&N; Railway passenger service. Post ICF ownership, the rail operator agreement had the private company Southern Railway operate the daily inter-city passenger service from Victoria to Courtenay on behalf of Via Rail. Train tickets had to be purchased three days in advance to avoid an increase in the cost of the fare. In 2011, due to the disrepair of the railway, Via Rail and Southern Railway suspended indefinitely the Dayliner passenger service, the Victoria ‚Äì Courtenay train. The train had scheduled stops at Duncan, Nanaimo, and Parksville, with many other flag stops (stops on request) along the way. Via and Southern Railway did offer a bus service for several months after the closure, but the service was discontinued August 7, 2011. Via's bus tickets had to be bought three days in advance and fewer than ten people a day used their temporary bus service.VIA Rail Canada Inc.  Travel Advisory - Temporary Bus Replacing VIA's Victoria to Courtenay Train Service To Make Last Trip August 7 The Via passenger service used Budd-built Rail Diesel Cars. Those rail cars are no longer on Vancouver island, and at least one is now owned by Rapido Trains, a model railroad company === Names of island railway === Until 1996, it was called the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway (which it is still called by people living on the Island). It then spent three years as E & N Railfreight, an internal short line within then owner Canadian Pacific Railway. Operations were then sold to RailAmerica. The RailAmerica subsidiary was named E&N; Railway Co (1998) Ltd. , thus maintaining the historic name associations for the Vancouver Island line. ==Island Corridor Foundation== A Via Rail RDC in Nanaimo ===Tax gift=== The not for profit Island Corridor Foundation is a partnership between the Cowichan Tribes and local governments along the SVI line. After years of work and negotiations, the ICF came to agreements with the Canadian Pacific Railway and with RailAmerica to hand over its Island rail assets to the foundation for tax credits.http://www.islandrail.ca/the- owner/en-line-donated-to-islanders/ In February 2006, the Canadian Pacific Railway donated its portion of the SVI right-of-way, which averages in width between Victoria and Courtenay, to the Island Corridor Foundation. The donation tax credit exchange was estimated to be valued at Cdn$236 million and encompasses of land, six historic railway stations and a number of trestles. In addition, CPR also supplied $2.3-million in \\"seed money\\" to the Foundation. Lands were also given that produce non-rail revenue generated by property leases and encroachments on the line.http://www.islandrail.ca/land-inquiries/ On 22 March 2006, RailAmerica donated ownership of the Port Alberni to Nanaimo portion of the SVI to the Island Corridor Foundation. === No trespassing policy === More people are starting to walk, hike and use off-road vehicles on the right of wayParksville Qualicum News - Railway officials, police, warn pedestrians - Mobile Edition Railway and ICF officials are asking people to stay off the tracks for their own safety. === Freight business === ICF chose Southern Railway of Vancouver Island (SVI) to operate the Island railway on Vancouver Island, after ICF‚Äôs acquisition of the railroad.http://www.islandrail.ca/freight/fact-sheets/the-operator/ The operator agreement started on July 1, 2006. In January 2010, the Southern Railway of British Columbia new train ferry terminal started operating in the Fraser River on Annacis Island shipping to Nanaimo via the Seaspan train ferry. The new train marine terminal was built with the help of $4.6 million in federal funding and cost $11 million. It increases the mainland's capacity and speed to load and unload railcar barges from the island.Terminal aids Island rail system The amount of freight traffic in 2008 and 2009 was about 1,000 cars per year. According to the Rule of 100,Blanchard Co Rule of 100 a generally accepted economic formula for short-line railways, a minimum of 100 freight cars per mile a year is required before a line is profitable due to depreciation accounting. The old E&N; route averages about 6.6 cars per mile. The ICF has estimated there is a potential business of 22,000 rail cars of freight each year on Vancouver Island. An ICF development strategies report estimated that 35,000 to 40,000 carloads per year, as the amount of business that would be required to bear the full capital cost of upgrading the railroad and maintain operations on a sustainable basis. If the capital costs of upgrading the railway are excluded, the business of 8,000 carloads per year would be required to pay for basic operating and maintenance costs. The most significant potential revenue is the Raven coal mine (west of Fanny Bay) needing up to 10,000 carloads per year. The foundation report noted the market potential for sourcing of aggregates like gravel for the Victoria market from alternative reserves up-Island. However, this market would be extremely competitive due to the availability of shipments of aggregate by barge from Lehigh‚Äôs facility in Sechelt and the new Johnson Street Bridge providing barge access to downtown Victoria.http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/publications/reports_and_studies/Evaluation_ENRailway/Final_Report/Phase_2-Development_Strategies.pdf In November 2014, SVI freight service along the entire Duncan-to-Parksville segment of the line was suspended following a risk assessment after the disrepair of the track had been continuously slowing train speeds down. No timeline was known for when service will resume. As of 2018, the only operational trackage left is a truncated 7-mile strip in the Nanaimo area, servicing the Superior Propane spur in north Nanaimo. The ICF is a partnership of the various local governments and First Nations communities along the railway, including 14 municipalities, 5 regional districts and 12 First Nations. ==SVI Rail operator of railway== The Washington company Southern Railway of Vancouver Island (SVI) is the operating railway for Vancouver Island freight and passenger services, and works under a haulage arrangement with Southern Railway of British Columbia (SRY). SVI provides rail freight services to various customers on Vancouver Island railway offering connections to the continental railway network. It also operates daily intercity passenger service from Victoria to Courtenay by arrangements with Via Rail Canada. SVI employs 22 people and has a wage bill of 1.25 million a year, as well as spending another 1 million for rail operations as part of the Island economy.http://www.sryraillink.com/vancouver_isl_service.htm ==Rail line closure and delayed re-openings== Alberni Pacific excursion train, June 2013 Beginning March 18, 2011 passenger service between Victoria and Courtenay was suspended indefinitely, due to safety concerns about the poor condition of the tracks. In April 2012 the Federal Government announced that it would match a $7.5 million grant offered by the BC Provincial Government, providing the required $15 million for basic repairs and upgrades to reopen the rail line. The line was expected to reopen, and rail services re-commence in 2013, as early the spring, but was delayed due to failed negotiations between the Island Corridor Foundation and Via Rail. In July 2014, an agreement was signed by Via Rail to resume operations with plans to have services resume in the summer of 2015, but in April 2015, the ICF stated that the resumption of service has been put on hold while the BC Ministry of Transportation and provincial government review the funds for covering repair costs. , passenger rail still has yet to reopen. ==Bike path beside E&N; in Victoria and Nanaimo== A bike path is being built beside the E&N; tracks from Vic West to Six Mile, while allowing rail service to continue. In April 2007 the Island Corridor Foundation agreed to lease its land in Greater Victoria to the CRD for the development of the bike trail.Parks - E&N; Rail Trail Project In Nanaimo an trail was built in the 1990s. The E & N Trail is a multi-purpose paved trail for cycling, walking, roller blading and wheelchairs. It stretches from Townsite Road in the south to Mostar in the north where it connects to the Parkway trail. In the fall of 2013 a partnership of various community groups interested in moving the E&N; Rail trail forward was formed and the Nanaimo Regional Rail Trail Partnership was born. The NRRTP comprises the Downtown Business Improvement Association (DNBIA), Tourism Nanaimo, Regional District of Nanaimo, the City of Nanaimo, Greater Nanaimo Cycling Coalition (GNCC), and the Island Corridor Foundation (ICF). As of 2015 the group has raised funds and is building the E&N; extension trail from the old Nanaimo train station to 7th Avenue in the south. It planned to have that multi-use trail finished by 2019. Concurrently, north of Nanaimo, the Regional District of Nanaimo (RDN) started with two new sections in 2018. The first sections of trail will total approximately and will connect the City of Parksville with Coombs and with French Creek. ==Rapid transit on E&N; in Victoria== In 1996 a BC Transit reporthttp://www.llbc.leg.bc.ca/public/pubdocs/bcdocs/295688/vic_ssr648.pdf proposed renewing the track and enhancing road crossing, to travel 13.3 km (8.3 miles) to arrive over the bridge into downtown Victoria from Station Avenue, Langford. The travel time was 24 minutes, using the existing track, including stops, and restricting the speed to 25 km/h (16 mph) due to the condition of the railway and street crossings. In 2008, a report by the BC Ministry of Transportation put the travel time at 36 minutes, using the existing track, and having a train travelling a further distance of 17.2 km (10.7 mi) from West Langford. This includes six stops and stopping at each station for half a minute. The speed varies from 8 to 65 km/h (5 to 40 mph). ==Sources== * * * == See also == * Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Roundhouse * List of heritage railways in Canada * SRY ==References== ==External links== *Island Corridor Foundation *Southern Railway of Vancouver Island *History of the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway *Via Rail Victoria ‚Äì Courtenay train *Via Rail Victoria ‚Äì Courtenay train schedule *Lewis Metzler Clement: A Pioneer of the Central Pacific Railroad *1925 Railway Schedule from Waghorn's Guide *Video clips of the E&N; from Youtube *Crown Land Grants: A History of the E&N; includes a map of Vancouver Island showing the boundaries of the land grant *Pictures and documents from the islands Railways, Streetcars and Steamships Category:British Columbia railways Category:History of Vancouver Island Category:Transport on Vancouver Island Category:Companies operating former Canadian Pacific Railway lines Category:Companies based in British Columbia Category:Nanaimo ","title":"Southern Railway of Vancouver Island"},{"id":"820281","text":"Hans RƒÅm Singh Rawat,Hans Ji Maharaj, Ram Navami (Basaki) Festival, Sarojini Nagar, New Delhi, April 1965. \\"My name is Hans Ram Singh\\" called Shrƒ´ Hans Jƒ´ MahƒÅrƒÅj and by various other honorifics (9 November 1900 ‚Äì 19 July 1966), was born in Gadh-ki-Sedhia, north-east of Haridwar in present-day Uttarakhand, India.

From that time he was raised by his aunt. As a young adult he visited many holy men in the nearby mountains and pilgrimage towns in the area now the Pakistani provinces of Sindh, Baluchistan and Punjab. He was reportedly disenchanted with these and turned to the Arya Samaj, a popular movement formed to remove caste prejudices and idolatry from Hinduism. The search for work led Hans to Lahore, the capital of the former Sikh kingdom. During this time he made his first contact with Swami Swarupanand, a guru in the lineage of Advait Mat, from Guna.Melton, J. Gordon, Bauman, Martin. Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices (2002), p.427, . Hans was a disciple of Sarupanand, a guru in the lineage of Shri Paramhans Advait Mat centered in Guna, a district in the state of Madhya Pradesh In 1923, Swami Swarupanand taught Hans the techniques of Knowledge or kriyas, an experience of which Hans later said: \\"I was given no mantra, but experienced Knowledge. I experienced the music and light of my heart. My mind was focused within\\". Three years later, in 1926, Swami Swarupanand asked him to start teaching others the techniques of Knowledge, and for the subsequent 10 years Hans traveled through what is today Pakistan and northern India.Melton, J. Gordon. Encyclopedia Handbook of Cults in America, p.143 A strong bond of teacher/disciple was formed between them which Swami Swarupanand reportedly referred to as follows: \\"I am in Hans' heart and Hans is in my heart\\". In 1936, Swami Swarupanand took mahasamadhi in Nangli Sahib, a village near the north town of Meerut. Reported indications from Swami Swarupanand about Hans' succession were later contested by a group of mahatmasMelton, Gordon J. Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America,(1986), pp.141‚Äì2 Garland Publishing, Early in life he encountered Sarupanand a guru of the Sant Mat tradition. Though Sarupanand Ji had told his disciples to follow Hans Maharaj Ji, after the guru's death another disciple, Vairaganand, claimed the succession and took control of the guru's property. who noted that Hans had married Sinduri Devi from a neighboring village in the district of Garwal, making him a \\"householder\\", a status that in their view as renunciates was not acceptable.Geaves, Ron, From Totapuri to Maharaji: Reflections on a Lineage (Parampara), paper delivered to the 27th Spalding Symposium on Indian Religions, Regents Park College, Oxford, 22‚Äì24 March 2002 After the rift, Hans was left with only a handful of people to help him continue his work. Hans branched out on his own with the understanding that he had his teacher's blessings, and continued teaching throughout the Indian sub-continent. That same year, he started presenting his message and teaching in the small town of Najibabad, near Haridwar. His talks at the time were strongly influenced by the egalitarian and reformist philosophy of the Arya Samaj, and he reportedly accepted anyone as his student, irrespective of caste, religion or status. This was an unusual stance for an Indian teacher, and it drew its share of criticism from traditional Hindus. During this year he published a book Hans Yog PrakashHans Ji Maharaj, Hans Yog Prakash (1936) (Unknown publisher), New Delhi as a first step to broadening the dissemination of his message. During the next years, Hans traveled by foot and by train to towns and villages across north India, speaking at small, impromptu gatherings at train stations, or under a tree in the village grounds. By the late 1930s, Hans had begun visiting Delhi, teaching workers at the Delhi Cloth Mills. He traveled constantly between Haridwar and Delhi, often staying at followers' houses at Paharganj and Connaught Place, behind the new Delhi center. In 1944, as the number of students grew, Hans purchased a small, two-floor house on the bank of the Ganges canal outside Haridwar, and named it \\"Prem Nagar\\" (\\"Town of Love\\"). The mahatmas who were helping him in a full-time capacity lived there with him in the tradition of the gurukul. Four years later, he reportedly purchased his first car, a green Austin Somerset, that assisted him in visiting nearby towns and villages in his effort to reach more people. Hans and his first wife, Sinduri Devi, had a daughter, Savitri, but after that Sinduri Devi was unable to have more children. As a consequence of that, and based on an understanding that Swarupanand reportedly had told him that \\"one day he [Hans] will have a son who would play an important role\\", he took a second wife in Rajeshwari Devi in 1946. Unlike his first wife, Rajeshwari Devi would in time become known as Mata Ji and play a prominent role in her husband's work. In 1951, their first son was born (SatpƒÅl), followed by three more in 1953 (Mahi PƒÅl), 1955 (Dharam PƒÅl), and 1957 (Prem PƒÅl), affectionately nicknamed \\"Sant Jƒ´\\" by Hans. As Hans RƒÅm's message was spreading throughout northern India, several initiatives were taken to facilitate his work, including the publishing of a monthly magazine named Hansadesh in 1951, and the formation of the Divine Light Mission (DLM).Melton, J. Gordon. Encyclopedia of American Religions:5th Edition, pp. 890‚Äì891 For nearly 30 years Hans disseminated his message without any formal organisation. After resisting suggestions for such an organisation, he finally gave in to growing pressure, and the Divine Light Mission was registered in Patna in 1960,C.L. Tandon, (secretary of the DLM) Satgurudev Sri Hans Ji Maharaj, (1970) Albion Press to develop and structure the growing activities across India.Geaves, Ron, \\"From Divine Light Mission to Elan Vital and Beyond: An Exploration of Change and Adaptation\\" (2004), Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions, Volume 7, Issue 3, pages 45‚Äì62, ISSN 1092-6690 (print), University of California Press. Note: Ron Geaves, a Senior Lecturer, Programme Leader and Chair in religious studies at the University of Chester in England, is a student of Prem Rawat. The mission aims discussed are that \\"in principle all religions are one\\" and that the understanding that \\"peace is indivisible\\" and achievable by individuals and that \\"disgruntled individuals and dissatisfied nations can never promote lasting peace in the world.\\" It also discusses some humanitarian initiatives. By the early 1960s there were students in most large cities, towns and villages in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan, as well as within the Indian communities in South Africa. Meetings were still small, and Hans' close relationship with his students continued. In 1963, the first of many large public programs was held in the Ram Lila grounds in New Delhi, reportedly attended by 15,000. In 1964, an event took place on Gandhi Maidan in the heart of old Delhi that attracted even larger crowds. Several ashrams were opened during that time, including a small one in Rajasthan and another larger one called Satlok (\\"Place of Truth\\") located between Delhi and Haridwar. In 1965, Hans attended a religious conference in New Delhi's Constitution Club that was chaired by the then Speaker of the India Parliament, Mr. Ayengar. That year Hans flew for the first time when he visited his students in Jammu, Kashmir. On 18 July 1966, while visiting a small ashram in Alwar, Hans fell ill, and the same day returned to Delhi by car. It is reported that he died at 3 a.m. the following morning. Three days later, in a procession led by his family and many grieving mahatmas, his ashes were taken to his home in Haridwar. ==Succession== During the customary 13 days of mourning following Hans's death, the succession was discussed by DLM officials. The youngest son, 8-year-old Prem Rawat, addressed the crowd and was accepted by them, as well as by his mother and brothers, as the \\"Perfect Master\\".Aagaard, Johannes. Who Is Who in Guruism?

In May 1974, Maharaj Ji married an American girl, Marolyn Johnson (now called Durga Ji), in direct defiance of his mother's wishes and the event shook the mission to its foundations. This marriage brought about an exodus from the ashrams, the stable core of the mission which had been a vital means of social control, as premies flocked to get married and began to produce their own children, within customary marriage structures. It was an important turning point for the mission. The followers seemed to grow up overnight into adults with normal family responsibilities and ties. The base of support inevitably shifted from the ashrams to the wider premie community. This meant that central control was very much weakened and that the ordinary, non-ashram premie began to play a more important role in determining the mission's fortunes. At the same time, many premies were shaken by the marriage and felt almost betrayed by their leader. It is apparent that the marriage was responsible for a loss of morale and therefore of support for the mission by many premies. \\"Richardson, James T., in Encyclopedia of Religion and Society, William H.

Members in these living arrangements made their own rules and regulations rather than accepting dictates from the Divine United Organization. For example, many premie houses across the country in 1975 did not adhere to the celibate life, one of the requirements of ashram life. Satpal became the new head of the organisation in India and later also became a prominent INC politician, being elected to the 11th and 15th Lok Sabha; he is considered a satguru by his followers. ==References== ==External links== Category:Prem Rawat Category:Indian Hindu religious leaders Category:1900 births Category:1966 deaths Category:People from Haridwar district Category:Advait Mat gurus Category:20th-century Hindu religious leaders ","title":"Hans Maharaj"},{"id":"820283","text":"William Albert Stanley \\"Bert\\" Oldfield (9 September 1894, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia ‚Äì 10 August 1976, Sydney, New South Wales) was an Australian cricket player. He played for New South Wales and Australia as wicket-keeper. ==Life and career== In World War I, Bert Oldfield served with the first Australian Imperial Force as a Corporal in the 15th Field Ambulance. He was wounded and knocked unconscious at Ypres Salient in 1917, and spent six months recovering from shell shock.The Oxford Companion to Australian Cricket, Oxford, Melbourne, 1996, p. 401. At the conclusion of the war he was selected to be part of the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team which played 28 first-class matches in Britain, South Africa and Australia between May 1919 and February 1920. Oldfield made his first-class debut in England in 1919, and played his first Test match against England in his hometown of Sydney in the 1920‚Äì21 season. In 1921 it was reported that he entered into negotiations to play for Lancashire as an amateur. He had injured himself on the passage to the UK in 1921, giving Carter the chance to restore his position, although Oldfield replaced him for the last two tests. He was dropped for several matches over the next few years, but established himself as Australia's automatic selection for wicket-keeper in the 1924-25 Ashes series against England. Portrait He missed only one other Test in his career, the fourth Test of the 1932-33 Bodyline series. In the notorious third Test at Adelaide, the English Bodyline tactic of bowling fast balls directed at the Australian batsmen's bodies reached its most dramatic moment when a ball from fast bowler Harold Larwood hit Oldfield in the head, fracturing his skull (although this was from a top edge off a traditional non-Bodyline ball and Oldfield admitted it was his fault). Oldfield was carried from the ground unconscious. He recovered in time for the fifth Test of the series. Always an easy-going personality, Oldfield immediately forgave Larwood for the incident, and the two eventually became firm friends when Larwood later emigrated to Australia. A ball from Harold Larwood hits Bert Oldfield in the head. Oldfield played Test cricket for four more years, ending his career in 1937. He was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year for 1927. Oldfield played 54 Tests for Australia, scoring 1,427 runs at an average of 22.65, and taking 78 catches and 52 stumpings. His tally of 52 stumpings remains a Test career world record; 28 were off Clarrie Grimmett alone. In first-class cricket he played 245 matches, scoring 6,135 runs at an average of 23.77, and taking 399 catches and 263 stumpings. After retiring from cricket he coached, taking several schoolboys teams on overseas tours. In 1964 he spent a month coaching cricketers in Ethiopia, and met Haile Selassie.Wisden 1965, p. 127. He was awarded an MBE in 1970. In 1988 a public school in Seven Hills, NSW was renamed as Bert Oldfield Public School to commemorate his life.http://www.bertoldfie-p.schools.nsw.edu.au/our-school/school-history An oval in the Sydney suburb of Killara is named in Oldfield's honour. left Autograph written at Bert Oldfield's Sports Store in 243 thumb ==See also== * List of New South Wales representative cricketers ==References== Category:1894 births Category:1976 deaths Category:Australia Test cricketers Category:Australian cricketers Category:Australian cricket coaches Category:New South Wales cricketers Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:Cricketers from Sydney Category:Australian Imperial Force Touring XI cricketers Category:Australian Members of the Order of the British Empire ","title":"Bert Oldfield"},{"id":"820289","text":"London Convention signatories The Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter 1972, commonly called the \\"London Convention\\" or \\"LC '72\\" and also abbreviated as Marine Dumping, is an agreement to control pollution of the sea by dumping and to encourage regional agreements supplementary to the Convention. It covers the deliberate disposal at sea of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft, and platforms. It does not cover discharges from land-based sources such as pipes and outfalls, wastes generated incidental to normal operation of vessels, or placement of materials for purposes other than mere disposal, providing such disposal is not contrary to aims of the Convention. It entered into force in 1975. As of September 2016, there were 89 Parties to the Convention. ==Background== The Convention was called for by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (June 1972, Stockholm), the treaty was drafted at the Intergovernmental Conference on the Convention on the Dumping of Wastes at Sea (13 November 1972, London) and it was opened for signature on 29 December 1972. It entered into force on 30 August 1975 when 15 nations ratified. As of 1 October 2001, there were 78 Contracting Parties to the Convention. International Administration of the Convention functions through Consultative Meetings held at International Maritime Organization (IMO) headquarters in London. The London Convention consists of 22 Articles and three Annexes. It follows a \\"black list/grey list\\" approach to regulating ocean dumping; Annex I materials (black list) generally may not be ocean dumped (though for certain Annex I materials dumping may be permissible if present only as \\"trace contaminants\\" or \\"rapidly rendered harmless\\" and Annex II materials (grey list) require \\"special care\\". Annex III lays out general technical factors to be considered in establishing criteria for issuance of ocean dumping permits. The main objective of the London Convention is to prevent indiscriminate disposal at sea of wastes that could be liable for creating hazards to human health; harming living resources and marine life; damaging amenities; or interfering with other legitimate uses of the sea. The 1972 Convention extends its scope over \\"all marine waters other than the internal waters\\" of the States and prohibits the dumping of certain hazardous materials. It further requires a prior special permit for the dumping of a number of other identified materials and a prior general permit for other wastes or matter. ==Implementation== A spray-painted sign above a sewer in Colorado Springs, Colorado warning people to not pollute the local stream by dumping. Since its entering into force in 1975, the convention has provided a framework for international control and prevention of marine pollution within which the contracting parties have achieved continuous progress in keeping the oceans clean. Among its milestones are the 1993 ban on ocean disposal of low-level radioactive wastes and the resolutions to end the dumping and incineration of industrial wastes. The efforts of the Parties are supported by a permanent secretariat hosted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The consultative meeting of the contracting parties to the London convention is the governing and political decision-making body of the convention. It takes advice on issues needing multidisciplinary expertise from the Joint Group of Experts on Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP) which is composed of specialised experts nominated by the IMO, FAO, UNESCO, IOC, WMO, WHO, IAEA, UN, and UNEP. A scientific group on dumping, composed of government experts from the parties to the convention a responsible to address any scientific requests from the consultative meeting, including the preparation of lists of hazardous substances, developing guide-lines on the implementation of the convention, and maintaining awareness of the impacts on the marine environments of inputs from all waste sources. The convention is implemented in the United States through Title I of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) which directs that implementing regulations are to apply binding requirements of LC to the extent that this would not relax the MPRSA. ===1996 Protocol=== On 17 November 1996, a special meeting of the Contracting Parties adopted the \\"1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972\\" which is to replace the 1972 Convention, subject to ratification. In line with UNCED's Agenda 21, the 1996 Protocol reflects the global trend towards precaution and prevention with the parties agreeing to move from controlled dispersal at sea of a variety of land-generated wastes towards integrated land-based solutions for most, and controlled sea disposal of few, remaining categories of wastes or other matter. Among the most important innovations brought by the 1996 protocol is the codification of the \\"precautionary approach\\" and the \\"polluter pays principle.\\" Reflecting these principles, the protocol embodies a major structural revision of the convention the so-called \\"reverse list\\" approach. Now, instead of prohibiting the dumping of certain (listed) hazardous materials, the parties are obligated to prohibit the dumping of any waste or other matter that is not listed in Annex 1 (\\"the reverse list\\") of the 1996 protocol. Dumping of wastes or other matter on this reverse list requires a permit. Parties to the protocol are further obligated to adopt measures to ensure that the issuance of permits and permit conditions for the dumping of reverse list substances comply with Annex 2 (the Waste Assessment Annex) of the protocol. The substances on the reverse list include dredged material; sewage sludge; industrial fish processing waste; vessels and offshore platforms or other man-made structures at sea; inert, inorganic geological material; organic material of natural origin; and bulky items including iron, steel, concrete and similar materials for which the concern is physical impact, and limited to those circumstances where such wastes are generated at locations with no land-disposal alternatives. In addition, the 1996 protocol prohibits altogether the practice of incineration at sea, except for emergencies, and prohibits the exports of wastes or other matter to non-Parties for the purpose of dumping or incineration at sea. The 1996 protocol has effectively moved the scope of the original London convention landwards, relating it to the policy and management issues of land as well as sea wastes disposal. Indicative for this shift are such elements as the codification of the precautionary approach and the establishment of requirements such as the \\"waste prevention audit,\\" the identification and control of the sources of contamination for certain materials, and the collaboration with relevant local and national agencies that are involved in point and non-point source pollution control. In this context, Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) comes as a natural framework for effective implementation of the objectives of the protocol. Relaying on its vast ICM technical expertise, the National Ocean Service (NOS) is to contribute to the creation of the necessary foundation for the US accession to the 1996 Protocol and, further on, to the protocol's implementation. Through its International Program Office, NOS would also contribute to the international co-operation efforts towards meeting the objectives of the 1996 Protocol. ==Parties== State parties - (87 as of

February 3, 1998) was an American woman sentenced to death for killing two people with a pickaxe during a burglary. She was the first woman to be executed in the United States since Velma Barfield in 1984, and the first in Texas since Chipita Rodriguez in 1863. She was convicted of murder in Texas in 1984 and executed by lethal injection after 14 years on death row. Due to her gender and widely publicized conversion to Christianity, she inspired an unusually large national and international movement that advocated the commutation of her sentence to life without parole, a movement that included a few foreign government officials. ==Early life== Karla Tucker was born and raised in Houston, Texas, the youngest of three sisters. Her father Larry was a longshoreman. The marriage of her parents was troubled, and Tucker started smoking cigarettes with her sisters when she was eight years old. During her parents' divorce proceedings when she was 10 years old, Tucker learned that her birth was the result of an extramarital affair.Karla Faye Tucker: Texas' Controversial Murdress, \\"Chapter 2: Early Days, Dark Days\\" from Crime Library By age 12, she had begun taking drugs and having sex. She dropped out of school at age 14 and followed her mother Carolyn, a rock groupie, into prostitution and began traveling with the Allman Brothers Band, The Marshall Tucker Band, and the Eagles. At 16, she was briefly married to a mechanic named Stephen Griffith. When she was in her early 20s, she began hanging out with bikers and met a woman named Shawn Dean and her husband Jerry Lynn Dean. The couple introduced her in 1981 to a man named Daniel Ryan Garrett (Danny Garrett). Then 21 years old, Tucker started dating 35-year-old Garrett.Death in Texas from the New York Review of Books. ==Murders== After spending the weekend using drugs with Garrett and their friends, Tucker and Garrett entered Jerry Dean's apartment in Houston, Texas around 3 a.m. on Monday, June 13, 1983, intending to steal a motorcycle that Dean was restoring there. James Liebrandt, a friend, went with them to Dean's apartment complex. Liebrandt reported that he went looking for Dean's El Camino while Tucker and Garrett entered the apartment with a set of keys that Tucker claimed Shawn Dean had lost and Tucker had found. During the burglary, Tucker and Garrett entered Dean's bedroom, where Tucker sat on him. In an effort to protect himself, Dean grabbed Tucker above the elbows, whereupon Garrett intervened. Garrett struck Dean numerous times in the back of the head with a ball-peen hammer that he found on the floor. After hitting Dean, Garrett left the room to carry motorcycle parts out of the apartment. Tucker remained in the bedroom. The blows Garrett had dealt Dean caused him to begin making a \\"gurgling\\" sound. Tucker wanted to \\"stop him from making that noise\\" and she then picked up a three-foot pickaxe that was laying against the wall and began hitting Dean. Garrett then re-entered the room and dealt Dean a final blow in the chest. Garrett left the bedroom again to continue loading Dean's motorcycle parts into his Ford Ranchero. Tucker was once again left in the room and only then noticed a woman who had hidden under the bed covers against the wall. The woman, Deborah Ruth Thornton, had argued with her husband the day before, went to a party and ended up spending the night in Dean's bed. Upon discovering Thornton, Tucker grazed her shoulder with the pickaxe. Thornton and Tucker began to struggle, but Garrett returned and separated them. Tucker proceeded to hit Thornton repeatedly with the pickaxe and then embedded the axe in her heart. Tucker would later tell people and testify that she experienced intense multiple orgasms with each blow of the pickaxe. The next morning, one of Dean's co-workers who had been waiting for a ride entered the apartment and discovered the victims' bodies. Police investigation led to the arrests of Tucker and Garrett, five weeks after the killings.Lowry, Beverly. Crossed Over: A Murder, A Memoir, New York: 1992, ===Trial=== In September 1983, Tucker and Garrett were indicted for murder and tried separately for the crimes. Tucker was charged with the murders of both Dean and Thornton, but after she testified against Garrett at his trial, the charge for the murder of Thornton was dropped. Garrett was not charged with Thornton's death, either. Tucker entered a plea of not guilty and was jailed awaiting trial. Soon after being imprisoned, Tucker took a Bible from the prison ministry program and read it in her cell. She later recalled, \\"I didn't know what I was reading. Before I knew it, I was in the middle of my cell floor on my knees. I was just asking God to forgive me.\\" Tucker became a Christian in October 1983. She later married by proxy her prison minister, Reverend Dana Lane Brown, in 1995 and held her Christian wedding ceremony inside the prison. === Conviction === Mountain View Unit, where Tucker was held Though the death penalty was hardly ever sought for female killers, Tucker, along with Garrett, was sentenced to death in late 1984. Garrett died of liver disease in 1993 while awaiting execution. Tucker shared her death row cell at the Mountain View Unit with Pam Perillo, whose own sentence was eventually commuted. Between 1984 and 1992, requests for a retrial and appeals were denied, but on June 22, Tucker requested that her life be spared on the basis that she was under the influence of drugs at the time of the murders. Tucker said that she was now a reformed person, and if she had not taken the drugs the murders would never have been committed. Her plea drew support from abroad and also from some leaders of American conservatism. Among those who appealed to the State of Texas on her behalf were Bacre Waly Ndiaye, the United Nations commissioner on summary and arbitrary executions; the World Council of Churches; Pope John Paul II; Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi; the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich; televangelist Pat Robertson; and Ronald Carlson, the brother of Tucker's murder victim Debbie Thornton. The warden of Texas's Huntsville prison testified that she was a model prisoner and that, after 14 years on death row, she likely had been reformed.American Justice ‚Äì Dead Woman Walking: The Karla Faye Tucker Story The board rejected her appeal on January 28, 1998. Hours before the execution, Texas Governor George W. Bush refused the final 11th-hour appeal to block her execution. ===Execution=== While on death row, Tucker was incarcerated in the Mountain View Unit in Gatesville, Texas.Geringer, Joseph. \\"Legal Tactics, Back and Forth.\\" Karla Faye Tucker: Texas' Controversial Murderess.

She selected four people to watch her die, who included her sister Kari Weeks, her spouse Dana Brown, her close friend Jackie Oncken, and Ronald Carlson. At one time, Carlson had supported the execution, but after a religious conversion he decided that he was now opposed to all executions. The witnesses for the murder victims included Thornton's husband Richard, Thornton's only child William Joseph Davis and Thornton's stepdaughter Katie. Tucker's execution was also witnessed by members of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Warden Bagget, and various representatives of the media. Her last words were:\\"Last Statement ‚Äì Karla Faye Tucker.\\" Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Retrieved on September 29, 2010. She was executed by lethal injection on February 3, 1998. As the deadly chemicals were being administered, she praised Jesus Christ, licked her lips, looked at the ceiling, and hummed. She was pronounced dead at 6:45 p.m. C.S.T., eight minutes after receiving the injection. She was buried at Forest Park Lawndale Cemetery in Houston. Tucker was the first woman executed in the State of Texas in 135 years, when Chipita Rodriguez was executed by hanging in 1863 during the American Civil War, and the second woman executed in the United States since the reinstatement of capital punishment in 1976. ==Aftermath== In the year following her execution, conservative commentator Tucker Carlson questioned Governor Bush about how the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles had arrived at the determination on her clemency plea. Carlson alleged that Bush, alluding to a televised interview which Karla Faye Tucker had given to talk show host Larry King, smirked and spoke mockingly about her.Carlson, Talk, September 1999, p. 106 Carlson later reviewed the Larry King interview transcript and discovered that nowhere did it show Tucker asking Bush to stay the execution, calling into question the accuracy of his claim. [citation needed] A full-length movie was released in 2004 about the life of Tucker entitled Forevermore starring actress Karen Jezek. The captain of the \\"Death House Team,\\" Fred Allen, was interviewed by Werner Herzog for the 2011 documentary Into the Abyss. Within days after Tucker's execution, one of over 120 he managed, he suffered an emotional breakdown. He resigned his job, giving up his pension, and changed his position on the death penalty. \\"I was pro capital punishment.

Such theories are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider rape to be a behavioral adaptation. Some object to such theories on ethical, religious, political, or scientific grounds. Others argue that a correct knowledge of the causes of rape is necessary to develop effective preventive measures. == A Natural History of Rape == The idea that rape evolved under some circumstances as a genetically advantageous behavioral adaptation was popularized by biologist Randy Thornhill and anthropologist Craig T. Palmer in their book A Natural History of Rape (2000). == Animal coercive sex == It has been noted that behavior resembling rape in humans is observed in the animal kingdom, including ducks and geese, bottlenose dolphins,Connor, Richard and Vollmer, Nicole (ed. Buss, David). 2005. Sexual Coercion in Dolphin Consortships: A comparison with Chimpanzees, pp 218. and chimpanzees.Akiko Matsumoto-Oda, Miya Hamai, Hitosige Hayaki, Kazuhiko Hosaka, Kevin D. Hunt, Eiiti Kasuya, Kenji Kawanaka, John C. Mitani, Hiroyuki Takasaki, and Yukio Takahata. 2007. Estrus Cycle Asynchrony in Wild Female Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii. Indeed, in orangutans, close human relatives, copulations of this nature may account for up to half of all observed matings.Wrangham, R., & Peterson, D. 1996. Demonic males. New York: Houghton Mifflin. Such behaviors, referred to as 'forced copulations', involve an animal being approached and sexually penetrated as it struggles or attempts to escape. These observations of forced sex among animals are not controversial. What is controversial is the interpretation of these observations and the extension of theories based on them to humans. \\"Thornhill introduces this theory by describing the sexual behavior of scorpionflies. In which the male may gain sex from the female either by presenting a gift of food during courtship or without a nuptial offering, in which case force is necessary to restrain her.\\"Wilson, Glenn. The Science of Sex: Glenn Wilson on Rape. The Great Sex Divide, pp. 128‚Äì131. http://www.heretical.com/wilson/rape.html == Human rape == It is hypothesized that rape is homologous to similar behavior in other animals. \\"Human rape appears not as an aberration but as an alternative gene-promotion strategy that is most likely to be adopted by the 'losers' in the competitive, harem- building struggle. If the means of access to legitimate, consenting sex is not available, then a male may be faced with the choice between force or genetic extinction.\\" Thornhill and Palmer write that \\"In short, a man can have many children, with little inconvenience to himself; a woman can have only a few, and with great effort.\\" Females therefore tend to be more selective with partners. Rape is seen as one potential strategy for males for achieving reproductive success. They point to several other factors indicating that rape may be a reproductive strategy. It is during the potentially childbearing years that women most often are rape victims. Rapists usually do not use more force than necessary to subdue their victims which is argued to be the case since physically injuring the victims would reduce the chance of reproduction. Furthermore, \\"In many cultures rape is treated as a crime against the victim's husband.\\" Anthropologist Edward H. Hagen states in his Evolutionary Psychology FAQ from 2002 that he believes there is no clear evidence for the hypothesis that rape is adaptive. He believes the adaptivity of rape is possible, but claims there is not enough evidence to be certain one way or the other. However, he encourages such evidence to be obtained: \\"Whether human males possess psychological adaptations for rape will only be answered by careful studies seeking evidence for such cognitive specializations. To not seek such evidence is like failing to search a suspect for a concealed weapon.\\" He also describes some conditions in the ancestral environment during which the reproductive gains from rape may have outweighed the costs: *\\"High status males may have been able to coerce matings with little fear of reprisal.\\" *\\"Low status women (e.g., orphans) may have been particularly vulnerable to being raped because males need not have feared reprisals from the woman's family.\\" *\\"During war, raping enemy women may have had few negative repercussions.\\" *\\"Men who were low status, who were likely to remain low status, and who had few opportunities to invest in kin may have realized reproductive benefits that outweighed the considerable costs (e.g., reprisal by the woman's family).\\"Is rape an adaptation? McKibbin et al. (2008) argue that there may be several different types of rapists or rape strategies. One is rape by disadvantaged men who cannot get sex otherwise. Another is \\"specialized rapists\\" who are more sexually aroused from rape than from consensual sex. A third type is opportunistic rapists who switch between forced and consensual sex depending on circumstances. A fourth type is psychopathic rapists. A fifth type is partner rape due to sperm competition when the male suspects or knows that the female has had sex with another male. There are varying degrees of empirical support for the existence of each of these types. More generally they mention research finding that at least one- third of males \\"admit they would rape under specific conditions\\" and that other surveys find that many men state having coercive sexual fantasies. They, as have others, \\"propose that rape is a conditional strategy that may potentially be deployed by any man.\\" === Women's defenses === Women may have developed several defenses against and strategies to avoid rape. One is a partner preference for men that are effective bodyguards against other men such as physically and socially dominant men (although there may also be other evolutionary reasons for such a preference). Another is great psychological pain which according to some research is greatest during the childbearing years. Other researchers have argued that the emotional pain may cause the women to focus on the social circumstances that enabled the rape with the aim to prevent future rapes. Other research has found that during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle women perform fewer behaviors that may increase the risk of an assault. Studies have also found that sensitivity for potential coercive behaviors in males as well as handgrip strength (but only in a simulated coercive situation) increase during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle. On the other hand, a 2003 study found that the frequency of pregnancy from rape is significantly higher than that of pregnancy in non- coercive intercourse, and advanced the hypothesis that male rapists disproportionately target women exhibiting biological indications of fertility. === Naturalistic fallacy === Thornhill and Palmer write that \\"Rape is viewed as a natural, biological phenomenon that is a product of the human evolutionary heritage\\". They further state that by categorizing a behavior as \\"natural\\" and \\"biological\\" they do not in any way mean to imply that the behavior is justified or even inevitable. \\"Biological\\" means \\"of or pertaining to life,\\" so the word applies to every human feature and behavior. But to infer from that, as many critics assert that Thornhill and Palmer do, that what is biological is somehow right or good, would be to fall into the so- called naturalistic fallacy. They make a comparison to \\"natural disasters as epidemics, floods and tornadoes\\". This shows that what can be found in nature is not always good and that measures should be and are taken against natural phenomena. They further argue that a good knowledge of the causes of rape, including evolutionary ones, are necessary in order to develop effective preventive measures. Evolutionary psychologists McKibbin et al. argue that the claim that evolutionary theories are justifying rape is a fallacy in the same way that it would be a fallacy to accuse scientists doing research on the causes of cancer, that they are justifying cancer. Instead, they say that understanding the causes of rape may help create preventive measures. Wilson et al. (2003) argue that evolutionary psychologists like Thornhill and Palmer use the naturalistic fallacy inappropriately to forestall legitimate discussion about the ethical implications of their theory. According to Thornhill and Palmer, a naturalistic fallacy is to infer ethical conclusions (e.g., rape is good) from (true or false) statements of fact (e.g., rape is natural). Wilson et al. point out that combining a factual statement with an ethical statement to derive an ethical conclusion is standard ethical reasoning, not a naturalistic fallacy, because the moral judgment is not deduced exclusively from the factual statement. They further argue that if one combines Thornhill and Palmer's factual premise that rape increases the fitness of a woman's offspring with the ethical premise that it is right to increase fitness of offspring, the resulting deductively valid conclusion is that rape has also positive effects and that its ethical status is ambiguous. Wilson et al. state that Thornhill and Palmer dismiss all ethical objections with the phrase 'naturalistic fallacy' although \\"it is Thornhill and Palmer who are thinking fallaciously by using the naturalistic fallacy in this way.\\" === Preventing rape === Thornhill and Palmer (2000) suggest a number of possible strategies for preventing rape. One example is explaining to males that they may have predispositions to misread the female invitation of sex. They believe that viewing rape as being due to a desire for domination, and not related to sexual desire, is generally harmful. One example being the claim that the way women dress will not affect the risk of rape. They argue that the much greater societal freedom of dating without supervision, and removal of many barriers between males and females, have created an environment that has also removed many earlier societal controls against rape. It is recommended that \\"men and women interact only in public places during the early stages of their relationships\\". === Victim counseling === Counseling of rape victims may also be improved by evolutionary considerations, according to Thornhill and Palmer, and they argue that the view that rape is due to a domination desire, cannot explain to the victim why the rapist seemed to be sexually motivated. Evolutionary considerations can also help explain the emotional pain felt, as well as the form it takes. They may also help the rape victim understand why the rape victim's partner may see the rape as a form of infidelity. They also argued that the victim's partner may be helped by such understanding, and be more able to change his or her reaction. == Criticism == The 2003 book Evolution, Gender, and Rape, written in response to A Natural History of Rape, compiles the views of twenty-eight scholars in opposition to sociobiological theories of rape. One contributor, Michael Kimmel, criticizes Thornhill and Palmer's argument that female rape victims tend to be sexually attractive young women, rather than children or older women, contrary to what would be expected if rapists selected victims based on inability to resist. Kimmel argues that younger women are the least likely to be married and the most likely to be out on dates with men, and therefore are the most likely to be raped because of opportunity arising from social exposure and marital status. Palmer and Thornhill responded to these critics in an article in the journal Evolutionary Psychology. Smith et al. (2001) criticized Thornhill and Palmer's hypothesis that a predisposition to rape in certain circumstances is an evolved psychological adaptation. They developed a fitness cost/benefit mathematical model and populated it with estimates of certain parameters (some parameter estimates were based on studies of the Ach√© in Paraguay). Their model suggested that generally only men with a future reproductive value of 1/10th or less of a typical 25-year-old man would have a net positive cost/benefit fitness ratio from committing rape. On the basis of their model and parameter estimates, they suggested that this would make it unlikely that rape generally would have net fitness benefits for most men.Why Do We Rape, Kill and Sleep Around? , Sharon Begley, The Daily Beast While defending the evolutionary psychology theory of rape against its more vehement critics, Vandermassen (2010) provides a critique of some aspects of the view. She characterises the view of Thornhill and Palmer as \\"extreme\\" (p. 736), as they fail to allow for the influence of any non-sexual motivations in the crime of rape. Vandermassen also notes two problems with the data cited by Thornhill and Palmer regarding the psychological trauma caused by the violence associated with rape: firstly, the data is inaccurately and confusingly presented in the book, often obscuring the fact that they do not support Thornhill and Palmer's \\"counterintuitive hypothesis\\" (p. 744) that more physical violence during rape is associated with less psychological pain. Secondly, more recent research has failed to support this hypothesis. A more moderate position, integrating the evolutionary psychology and feminist theories on rape, is presented by Vandermassen, based in part on the work of feminist evolutionary researcher Barbara Smuts. Hamilton (2008) has criticized Thornhill and Palmer's definition of rape as the coerced vaginal penetration of women of reproductive age. He has suggested that the exclusion of male rape, rape of women outside the reproductive age range, murderous rape, and non-vaginal forms of rape virtually guaranteed the confirmation of their hypothesis that rape is an evolved reproductive strategy and not a crime of violence. Hamilton has argued that evolutionary psychology fails to explain rape because, by evolutionary psychology's own criteria, an adaptation to rape children or men, or non-vaginal rape, would have been eliminated in the course of evolution because it did not confer reproductive advantage on our ancestors. Evolutionary psychologist David Buss states that clear-cut evidence for or against rape as an adaptation is lacking. He states that rape may instead be a non-adaptive by-product of other evolved mechanisms, such as desire for sexual variety and for sex without investment, sensitivity to sexual opportunities, and a general capacity for physical aggression. == See also == * Violence against women * Animal sexual behaviour: coercive sex * Sexual selection * Sexy son hypothesis == References == == Further reading == ;Forced sex in animals: * * ;Theories regarding rape in humans: * * Thornhill, R. and Palmer, C.

Perc√© Rock appears from a distance like a ship under sail. It is one of the world's largest natural arches located in water and is considered a geologically and historically rich natural icon of Quebec. It is a major attraction in the Gasp√©sie region. ==Etymology== The massive rocky cliff is called by several names, such as le Rocher Perc√©, Pierced Rock, Pierced Island, Split Rock or Perc√© Rock. The name is attributed to the pierced rock that formed an arch high on its seaward southern end, as though a needle had cut through the rock. It was named Perc√© (\\"pierced rock\\") by Samuel de Champlain in 1607, in reference to the holes he had seen in the massive block of limestone, which over the years has become a major attraction in the province of Quebec. ==Legend== The Perc√© Rock, described as \\"the monstrous giant; pierced through by an immense eye, now green, now gray, now blue or violet, according to the moods of the sea\\", is linked in legend to a young man of a noble French family. Another version of the legend, which is also narrated by the local people of Perc√© town, is that they see the rock in the shape of a \\"phantom\\" during storms and hence call it \\"Le G√©nie de l'Isle Perc√©e\\". This, however, could be interpreted to mean that the vapoury clouds that engulf the \\"vast flocks of water fowl\\" could give such an impression when viewed from a distance. ==Geography== Northern gannets on Bonaventure Island and also seen on Perc√© Rock Perc√© Rock is part of the range of cliffs, bays and hills on the southwest side of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, which are formed of reddish-gold limestone and shale. It is linked to mainland (at Rue du Mont Joli) by a sandbar at low tide. The Bay of Perce is situated between this rock and the High Head. There is a reef to the SW of Perc√© Rock, about away from the shore. The town of Perc√© is located on the shores of the bay. Its main industry is fishing. Perc√© reef is about from the centre of the town where small vessels can be moored. Midway across the rock is a shoal that stretches over a length of . The rock formation has about 150 fossil species. In Bonaventure Island where the park is situated, conglomerates from the Carboniferous period of more than 310 million years are recorded. Next to the rock is Bonaventure Island, and together they form Parc national de l'√éle- Bonaventure-et-du-Rocher-Perc√© (Bonaventure Island and Perc√© Rock National Park), founded in 1985, which covers an area of about . The tip of the Gasp√© Peninsula has five geological formations, and Perc√© Rock is the only one located within the park. The park extends over a stretch of the coastline, and exhibits a wide variety of flora and fauna. It is a migratory bird sanctuary for the northern gannet, and has over 110,000 nesting birds, the second largest in the world. (The Municipal website of Perc√© mentions that the population of northern gannets is 121,000, which exceeds the figures mentioned for the archipelago of St Kilda in Scotland)- Other birds found on the island include puffins, razorbills, black guillemot and kittiwakes, as well as over 200 other species. From May to December, some species of blue whale, humpback whale, minke whale or fin whale can be seen along the coast near Perc√©, Bonaventure Island and Forillon National Park. At low tide, the rock is approachable on foot. The rock and the bird colony in Bonaventure Island is about a 75-minute trip from Perc√© by boat. Visits to the rock are restricted to the period from May 28 to October 12. During such visits, park guides provide information on beach creatures, the geology of Perc√© Rock, also called the \\"cathedral of limestone that rose from the Equator\\", and the fossils found there. The rock mass is a monolith estimated at 5 million tonnes. It has been inferred that at the current erosion rate (about 300 tonnes of mass per year lost to the action of water and wind), it will disappear in about 16,000 years. In view of its tendency to collapse, it is dangerous to venture close to the rock on foot during low tide. The top of the rock is not accessible because of its height. Snowy gannets, silvery gulls, black cormorants and other species of birds perch there. An interpretation centre in Perc√©, housed in Le Chafaud, an elegant restored building, has a thematic exhibition titled \\"Un rocher, une √Æle, un parc national\\", meaning \\"one rock, one island, one national park\\", which recounts the bird life, marine life, geology, history and ecosystem of the park and the rock. ==Description== Perc√© Rock is a massive siliceous limestone stack formation, with sandstone and siltstone veins, with steep rock faces on all sides. It is long, wide, and high at its highest point. It is described as a narrow bluff emerging out of the sea, \\"resembling a beached supertanker from some angles\\". For four hours at a time during low tide, the water recedes from a wide spit that allows the rock itself to be visited. ==History== Print title: \\"A view of the Pierced Island, a remarkable rock in the Gulf of St. Laurence‚Äîtwo leagues to the southward of Gasp√©e Bay\\" drawn by Captain Hervey Smyth, 1760; engraved by Pierre Charles Cannot 1768. Note there are two arches Perc√© Rock's huge limestone formation is geologically dated to the Devonian period of more than 400 million years ago (375 million years is also mentioned). However, Perc√© Rock is only a small component of the large areas of Devonian rocks that occupy the interior that were first mapped in 1844 by Sir William Edmond Logan, known as the father of Canadian geology. Fossils in such rocks show a variety of animal and plant communities from both terrestrial and marine habitats from the Devonian period. The Perc√© Rock contains 150 species of different fossils such as brachiopod, trilobites, dalmanites, corals and marine worms from the Devonian period. Originally, the Perc√© Rock was inferred as connected to the main land. When Jacques Cartier, the first colonist arrived here in 1534, he reported three arches in the massive rock formation. In time, two of the arches disappeared, with the last one collapsing on June 17, 1845, leaving a separated pillar. When it was seen in 1603 by the French geographer and founder of Quebec City, Samuel de Champlain, it had only one arch. However, in 1760, a picture of Perc√© Rock drawn by an English officer, Captain Hervey Smyth, showed two arches, one of which collapsed in June 1845. Perc√© rock's two large holes were cut through by the sea waves. One of the holes seen now is an arch described as \\"gothic arch of rock\\", which is about high. A small boat can pass through the arch during high tide. Of the two arches, the outer arch, which collapsed with great force in 1845, remains in the form of an \\"obelisk\\". In early 1900s, enchanted by the beauty of the Perc√© Rock, travellers started visiting the area of Gaspe, Perc√© and Bonaventure Island. ==In popular culture== Perc√© village, Perc√© Rock and the Parc national de l'√Æle-Bonaventure-et-du-Rocher-Perc√© (Bonaventure Island and Perc√© Rock National Park) Perc√© Rock is a major tourist attraction in Quebec, with picturesque views of the rock from both Perc√© and nearby Bonaventure Island. French surrealist poet Andr√© Breton (1896‚Äì1966) visited Gasp√© in October 1944 and recorded his impressions of the visit in Arcanum 17, \\"a hymn of hope, renewal, and resurrection\\". The name of the poem stands for the 17th tarot card in the Major Arcana, called the Star, which symbolizes a woman pouring lunar forces into a mundane world and represents negative connotations of loss or abandonment of hope or bright prospects. During the visit, Breton was attracted to the Perc√© Rock and drew inspiration from it. In contrast to his unhappy personal life in war-torn Europe, the Rock provided him with the inspiration and reminder that \\"nature renews herself and that death is only transitory.\\" He called Perc√© Rock a \\"razor blade rising out of the water, an image very imperious and commanding, a marvelous iceberg of moon stone ... to a distracted observer though to a common man it is just but a resting place of birds\\". ==See also== Durdle Door ==References== ==External links== *Perc√© Rock at The Natural Arch and Bridge Society Category:Gasp√© Peninsula Category:Coastal islands of Quebec Category:Natural arches Category:Stacks of Canada Category:Landforms of Gasp√©sie‚Äì√éles-de-la-Madeleine Category:Tourist attractions in Gasp√©sie‚Äì√éles-de-la-Madeleine Category:Rock formations of Canada ","title":"Perc√© Rock"},{"id":"820517","text":"Cross Canadian Ragweed was an American country rock band formed in Yukon, Oklahoma in 1994. The band consisted of Cody Canada (lead guitar/vocals), Grady Cross (guitar), Randy Ragsdale (drums), and Jeremy Plato (bass guitar). The group released seven studio albums and three live albums from 1994 until 2010. The band was at the forefront of the rise of the red dirt music scene in Oklahoma and the Texas Music scene. After almost 15 years together, the group disbanded in 2010. == Formation == Cross Canadian Ragweed started when Randy Ragsdale and original bass guitar player Matt Weidemann, who had been playing in local bands together, met Cody Canada and Grady Cross who had also been playing together. The 4 had known each other since grade school and started playing together in Ragsdale's home 7 nights a week under the tutelage of Ragsdale's father Johnny, who had worked with musical artists in the area. After playing together, the band officially formed by combining a part of every band member's last name, coming up with the name Cross Canadian Ragweed. Weidemann left the group shortly after and Jeremy Plato joined to play the bass guitar. After finishing high school, the band moved to the College Town of Stillwater, Oklahoma, where acts like Mike McClure's The Great Divide and singer-songwriter Jimmy LaFave had established enough of a local scene to earn Stillwater the nickname North Austin. ==Carney and Live And Loud at the Wormy Dog Saloon== The group had already received significant college radio airplay before it released its first album, Carney in 1998 on their own independent label. Initially, selling the band in the market it was based in, was considered by music observers to be far-fetched; however, the fan base's passion and loyalty to the band allowed them to find success in releasing that first album. Carney was well received, then the band released Live and Loud at the Wormy Dog Saloon in 1999, which was also well received, especially in the local scene. ==Highway 377== Ragweed released its second studio album Highway 377 in 2001, though it was recorded in 1999. It propelled them into wider audience and into Texas, where Canada was born and also where the band had been touring heavily. Though not a released single, the song \\"Long Way Home\\" was featured on several Dodge Truck Commercials in both Texas and Oklahoma which added to the popularity of the band. The band paid tribute to drummer Randy Ragsdale's father Johnny, who has passed away from cancer in 1997 with the track \\"Johnny's Song.\\" ==Live and Loud at Billy Bob's Texas== In 2002 Ragweed recorded the popular live album Live and Loud at Billy Bob's Texas in Fort Worth, Texas. The songs were mainly live versions of songs off Carney and Highway 377, with a handful of cover songs. ==Cross Canadian Ragweed (Purple Album)== In 2002, the group then signed with Universal South records and released a self-titled album also alternately known as 'The Purple Album'. It was a tribute to the band's \\"little sister\\" Mandy Ragsdale, the younger sister of the band's drummer Randy Ragsdale, who had died in an auto accident near College Station, Texas, and whose favorite color was purple. The album produced charted singles \\"17\\" and the ballad \\"Constantly\\", and released a music video for the hard rock track \\"Don't Need You.\\" ==Soul Gravy== Ragweed's 2004 album, Soul Gravy, debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard charts. Lee Ann Womack provided background vocals on the popular single \\"Sick and Tired\\". The project also saw the re-release of the song \\"Alabama\\" (off of 2001's Highway 377) with a heavier electric sound, which appeared on the Billboard Charts as well. ==Garage== In October 2005 the band released Garage, described by both the band and raters at AllMusic as the group's \\"grungiest album ever.\\" Two songs, \\"Fighting' For\\" and \\"This Time Around\\" both became hits off the album. The album charted higher than any studio album the band ever released and for the first time, the band broke into rock radio airplay across the United States duo to the song \\"Dimebag\\", a tribute to former Damageplan and Pantera guitarist \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell Abbott, who had been killed months earlier during a concert, in addition to a heavier rock sound overall. ==Back To Tulsa: Live And Loud At Cain's Ballroom== In late 2006, Ragweed released their third and final live album, Live and Loud At Cain's Ballroom in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The band's 24 song project was well received and featured songs from their previous projects The Purple Album, Soul Gravy, and Garage. It also featured a handful of covers as well such as Neil Young's The Needle and the Damage Done and Robert Earl Keen's \\"Lonely Feeling.\\" ==Mission California== Cross Canadian Ragweed recorded Mission California, their fourth studio album, at the end of March 2007. The namesake of the album was due to the recording taking place in San Diego, California. The band spent 25 days in the studio; the first 5 cutting 15 tracks, the next 20 polishing each. Lee Ann Womack once again laid down background vocals on 4 of the tracks to include the Chris Knight cover \\"Cry Lonely.\\" Mission California was released on October 2, 2007. AllMusic reviewed the Album and found that the project was \\"name appropriately, the band sounds much more a progressive West Coast sound in many of the tracks and less rural rock.\\" ==Happiness and All the Other Things== The band's tenth and final album, Happiness and All the Other Things was released on August 31, 2009, commemorating the band's 15th Anniversary. It featured 12 new studio tracks and three live tracks. Recorded in California, this album includes a track entitled \\"51 Pieces\\", which Canada penned with Mickey Braun. The song was based on an incident where Ohio State police ransacked the band's bus after a stop in Cleveland at the House of Blues. It also featured \\"Blue Bonnets\\" which is dedicated to Cody's oldest son Dierks. Happiness and All the Other Things was officially dedicated to the late Randall Locke (Willie Nelson's long-time stage manager) who suddenly died on May 6, 2009. Other popular tracks were \\"To Find My Love\\", \\"Burn Like The Sun\\", and \\"Kick In The Head.\\" == Hiatus and band break-up == In May 2010, Cross Canadian Ragweed announced a hiatus from touring. In a band press release, Ragsdale explained, \\"Right now, I need to be at home for my family, particularly my son JC, who has autism. He's 10 years old now and still struggling in his development. I feel the only way I can help him is to be more hands on and close to home.\\" Despite Ragsdale wanting to \\"get another drummer and press on,\\" Canada stated \\"We‚Äôve always said from the start, we‚Äôre Ragweed as the four of us, or not Ragweed at all.\\" In September 2010, Canada officially announced the band was calling it quits by announcing their \\"Last Call Show\\" in October 2010 at Joe's Bar in Chicago, IL, stating \\"as far as that‚Äôs concerned, Oct 24 is the last one, the last gig.\\" == Post break-up == Since Cross Canadian Ragweed, Canada and Plato formed The Departed with fellow Yukon-native Dave Bowen (drums), Seth James (guitar), and Steve Littleton (keyboards), releasing their debut album \\"This Is Indian Land\\" in June 2011. Ragsdale and Cross both returned to Yukon. Ragsdale played with Stoney LaRue until 2013 and now works in the oil and natural gas industry, while Cross purchased and operates the bar that was the very first venue Cross Canadian Ragweed performed in 1994. In 2019 Grady Cross and Randy Ragsdale joined singer-songwriter Jason Young to form the band Cross Rags and Young. ==Influences and sound== The band was influenced by grunge, alternative rock of the 1990s along with early southern rock acts as well as outlaw country. Canada said that rock bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, AC/DC, and Soundgarden all were a part of the influence on the band's sound as well as country music influences Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, and Robert Earl Keen, in addition to southern rockers Marshall Tucker Band, and Lynyrd Skynyrd, among others. Due to their unique sound, the band often had a hard time getting radio airplay on either mainstream rock or country stations. == Notable appearances == The band frequently played with other stars of the Red Dirt and Texas Music scene including Stoney Larue, Micky & The Motorcars, Reckless Kelly, (Canada's brother-in-law) Wade Bowen, No Justice, Johnny Cooper, Seth James, and Brandon Rhyder. The band played with country music star Dierks Bentley numerous times. Bentley referenced the band in his song \\"Free and Easy (Down the Road I Go)\\", singing that \\"Ragweed's rockin' on the radio\\".

Maia is the daughter of AtlasHesiod, Theogony 938. and Pleione the Oceanid,Pseudo- Apollodorus, Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheke 3.10.1. and is the oldest of the seven Pleiades.Bibliotheke 3.10.2. Maia is the only one of the Pleiades named by this source to appear also in the rather idiosyncratic list given by the Scholiast to Theocritus (13.25), who says they were the daughters of the Amazons; see the note of J.G. Frazer in his 1921 Loeb Classical Library edition and translation of what was then assumed to be the work of Apollodorus of Athens, the Bibliotheca, vol. 2, p. 2. They were born on Mount Cyllene in Arcadia,Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheke 3.10.1. and are sometimes called mountain nymphs, oreads; Simonides of Ceos sang of \\"mountain Maia\\" (Maiados oureias) \\"of the lovely black eyes.\\"Simonides, Fragment 555. Because they were daughters of Atlas, they were also called the Atlantides.Diodorus Siculus 3.60.4. ==Mother of Hermes== Mercury and MaiaAlthough the identification of Mercury is secure, based on the presence of the caduceus, the one-shouldered garment called the chlamys, and his winged head, the female figure has been identified variously. The cup is part of the Berthouville Treasure, found within a Gallo-Roman temple precinct; see Lise Vogel, The Column of Antoninus Pius, Loeb Classical Library Monograph (Harvard University Press, 1973), p. 79 f., and Martin Henig, Religion in Roman Britain, Taylor & Francis, 1984, 2005, p. 119 f. In Gaul, Mercury's regular consort is one of the Celtic goddesses, usually Rosmerta. The etymology of Rosmerta's name as \\"Great Provider\\" suggests a theology compatible with that of Maia \\"the Great\\". The consort on the cup has also been identified as Venus by M. Chabouillet, Catalogue g√©n√©ral et raisonn√© des cam√©es et pierres grav√©es de la Biblioth√©que Imp√©riale, Paris 1858, p. 449. Maia is suggested by the concomitant discovery of a silver bust, not always considered part of the hoard proper but more securely identified as Maia and connected to Rosmerta; see E. Babelon, Revue arch√©ologique 24 (1914), pp. 182‚Äì190, as summarized in American Journal of Archaeology 19 (1915), p. 485. inside a silver cup dedicated by the freedman P. Aelius Eutychus (late 2nd century AD), from a Gallo-Roman religious site According to the Homeric Hymn to Hermes, Zeus in the dead of night secretly raped Maia, who avoided the company of the gods, in a cave of Cyllene. She became pregnant with Hermes. After giving birth to the baby, Maia wrapped him in blankets and went to sleep. The rapidly maturing infant Hermes crawled away to Thessaly, where by nightfall of his first day he stole some of his half-brother Apollo's cattle and invented the lyre from a tortoise shell. Maia refused to believe Apollo when he claimed that Hermes was the thief, and Zeus then sided with Apollo. Finally, Apollo exchanged the cattle for the lyre, which became one of his identifying attributes. ==As nurturer== Maia also raised the infant Arcas, the child of Callisto with Zeus. Wronged by the love affair, Zeus' wife Hera in a jealous rage had transformed Callisto into a bear. Arcas is the eponym of Arcadia, where Maia was born.Bibliotheke 3.101. The story of Callisto and Arcas, like that of the Pleiades, is an aition for a stellar formation, the constellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, the Great and Little Bear. Her name is related to ŒºŒ±·øñŒ± (maia), an honorific term for older women related to ŒºŒÆœÑŒ∑œÅ (mƒìtƒìr) 'mother', also meaning \\"midwife\\" in Greek.Vivian Nutton, Ancient Medicine (Routledge, 2004), p. 101. ==Roman Maia== Vulcan and Maia (1585) by Bartholom√§us Spranger In ancient Roman religion and myth, Maia embodied the concept of growth,Robert Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome: Religion in Everyday Life from Archaic to Imperial Times, Routledge, 2001, p. 70. as her name was thought to be related to the comparative adjective maius, maior \\"larger, greater\\". Originally, she may have been a homonym independent of the Greek Maia, whose myths she absorbed through the Hellenization of Latin literature and culture.Pierre Grimal, The Dictionary of Classical Mythology, Blackwell, 1996, p. 270 (originally published in French in 1951). In an archaic Roman prayer,Preserved by Aulus Gellius, Attic Nights 13.10.2. Maia appears as an attribute of Vulcan, in an invocational list of male deities paired with female abstractions representing some aspect of their functionality. She was explicitly identified with Earth (Terra, the Roman counterpart of Gaia) and the Good Goddess (Bona Dea) in at least one tradition.By Cornelius Labeo, as recorded by Macrobius, 1.12.20; H.H.J. Brouwer, Bona Dea: The Sources and a Description of the Cult, Brill, 1989, pp. 232, 354. Her identity became theologically intertwined also with the goddesses Fauna, Ops, Juno, Carna, and the Magna Mater (\\"Great Goddess\\", referring to the Roman form of Cybele but also a cult title for Maia), as discussed at some length by the late antiquarian writer Macrobius.Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.12.16‚Äì33. This treatment was probably influenced by the 1st- century BC scholar Varro, who tended to resolve a great number of goddesses into one original \\"Terra\\".Brouwer, Bona Dea, p. 354. The association with Juno, whose Etruscan counterpart was Uni, is suggested again by the inscription Uni Mae on the Piacenza Liver.In Mario Torelli's diagram of this haruspicial object, the names Uni and Mae appear together in a cell on the edge of the liver; see Nancy Thompson de Grummond, Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend, University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology, 2006, p. 44 (online). The month of May (Latin Maius) was supposedly named for Maia, though ancient etymologists also connected it to the maiores \\"ancestors\\", again from the adjective maius, maior, meaning those who are \\"greater\\" in terms of generational precedence. On the first day of May, the Lares Praestites were honored as protectors of the city,Ovid, Fasti v. 73; Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome, p. 70. and the flamen of Vulcan sacrificed a pregnant sow to Maia, a customary offering to an earth goddessMacrobius, Saturnalia 1.12.20; Juvenal, Satires ii.86; Festus 68. that reiterates the link between Vulcan and Maia in the archaic prayer formula. In Roman myth, Mercury (Hermes), the son of Maia, was the father of the twin Lares, a genealogy that sheds light on the collocation of ceremonies on the Kalends of May.T.P. Wiseman, Remus: A Roman Myth, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 71. On May 15, the Ides, Mercury was honored as a patron of merchants and increaser of profit (through an etymological connection with merx, merces, \\"goods, merchandise\\"), another possible connection with Maia his mother as a goddess who promoted growth.Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome, p. 70 f. == See also == * 66 Maja, asteroid * Bona Dea * Maia (star) * Maiasaura * Rosmerta ==References== ==Bibliography== * Grimal, Pierre, The Dictionary of Classical Mythology, Wiley-Blackwell, 1996, . \\"Maia\\" p. 270 *Harry Thurston Peck, Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities, 1898 * Smith, William; Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, London (1873). \\"Maia\\" *Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1911. ==External links== * Theoi Project ‚Äì Nymphe Maia Category:Divine women of Zeus Category:Greek goddesses Category:Nature goddesses Category:Pleiades (Greek mythology) Category:Roman mythology Category:Harvest goddesses Category:Mythological rape victims ","title":"Maia"},{"id":"820567","text":"Day of the Viper is a first-person adventure video game published by Accolade in 1989.

Water from an infiltration gallery has the advantage of bank filtration to reduce the water treatment requirements for a surface withdrawal. An infiltration gallery may also be the best way to withdraw water from a thin aquifer or lens of fresh water overlying saline water. ==Storm water disposal== Infiltration galleries may be used to supplement a storm sewer, by directing storm runoff from non-road areas. While the catchbasins under sewer grates work well on swift-flowing surfaces like asphalt and concrete, heavy storm water flow on grass lawns or other open areas will pool in low areas if there is no outlet. An infiltration gallery serves this purpose in two ways. Primarily, upright plastic pipes capped with simple grates are placed every 5‚Äì8 metres along the low point of a slope, to handle heavy surface runoff. The pipes proceed straight down, about two metres, to a horizontal cross-pipe; this pipe is the secondary system. About ten per cent of the surface area of a horizontal pipe is then perforated slightly and surrounded by gravel. Initially, runoff will exit the pipe and infiltrate the gravel to the soil beyond, dissipating naturally. As flow increases, the water will eventually fill the pipe and need to be dissipated more quickly. Thus, a catchbasin is placed at the lowest point of the sloping ground, which is connected to the storm sewer system at large. Such galleries are a relatively new development in urban planning, and are thus found in newer housing developments.*http://www.wateraid.org/documents/plugin_documents/ifg_guidelines.pdf ==References== Category:Drainage Category:Hydraulic engineering Category:Subterranea (geography) ","title":"Infiltration gallery"},{"id":"820575","text":"Maia , designated 20 Tauri (abbreviated 20 Tau), is a star in the constellation of Taurus. It is a blue giant of spectral type B8 III, a chemically peculiar star, and the prototype of the Maia variable class of variable star. Maia is the fourth-brightest star in the Pleiades open star cluster (Messier 45), after Alcyone, Atlas and Electra. It is surrounded by one of the brighter reflection nebulae within the Pleiades, designated NGC 1432 and sometimes called the Maia Nebula. == Nomenclature == The name Maia originates with the and . Maia is one of the seven daughters of Atlas and Pleione in Greek mythology--stars which are also included in the Pleiades star cluster. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Maia for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. 20 Tauri is the star's Flamsteed designation. Although it is about the 15th brightest star in Taurus, Maia does not have a Bayer designation, but does have the Bright Star Catalogue designation HR 1149 and the Henry Draper Catalogue designation HD 23408. It has been listed as double star WDS J03458+2422; one companion is a 14th magnitude star nearly away that is probably an unrelated background object. The primary is listed as being double following observations of a lunar occultation, but later observations have failed to find any evidence of it being double. == Description == NGC 1432 surrounding Maia The distance to Maia has been measured by the Gaia spacecraft using the annual parallax method. In Gaia Data Release 2, the parallax is given as , corresponding to a distance of . The 2007 new Hipparcos reduction gives a statistically more accurate parallax of , indicating a distance of . Analysis of Gaia parallaxes for the whole Pleiades cluster give an average distance of , while VLBI measurements of multiple members give a distance of . Maia's visual magnitude is 3.87, requiring darker skies to be seen. Its bolometric luminosity is 501 times solar, mostly in the ultraviolet, thus suggesting a radius that is 3.6 times that of the Sun and a mass that is 3.8 times solar. Interferometric measurements give an angular diameter of , suggesting a radius of assuming a distance of . These measurements also allow the effective temperature to be estimated at . Maia is a chemically peculiar star, meaning it has an unusual surface abundance of some elements as shown by its spectral lines. It is classified as a helium-weak star, but it also shows an excess of some elements including manganese. Maia was thought to be a variable star by astronomer Otto Struve. He proposed a class of stars known as Maia variables, which included Gamma Ursae Minoris, but Maia and some others in the class have since been found to be stable. Intense study of large numbers of stars suggest that 6.7% of stars with temperatures between and show rapid small-amplitude pulsations but are not members of other variable star classes. These are potentially Maia variables. Maia is surrounded by the Maia Nebula (also known as NGC 1432), a reflection nebula that is one of the brightest patches of nebulosity within the Pleiades star cluster. It is the only member of the New General Catalogue discovered photographically. ==Mythology== Hermes with his mother Maia. Detail of the side B of an Attic red-figure belly-amphora, ca. 500 BC. Maia was the oldest of seven beautiful sisters known as the Pleiades. She was impregnated by Zeus, thereby conceiving Hermes, the messenger god. As Maia and the Pleiades are visible in the winter night sky along with the constellation Orion, the Greek myths tell of Maia and her sisters being pursued by the giant huntsman and turned into doves to preserve their safety.Hesiod, Works and Days 619ff. == See also == * Maia in fiction == References == == External links == *Jim Kaler's Stars, University of Illinois:Maia (20 Tauri) *High-resolution LRGB image based on 4 hrs total exposure: NGC 1432 - Maia Nebula *APOD Pictures: **1) Orion, the giant huntsman, in pursuit of the Pleiades **2) Young Moon and Sister Stars **3) Pleiades and Stardust Category:B-type giants Tauri, 020 Category:Pleiades Open Cluster Category:Taurus (constellation) Maia Category:Suspected variables 1149 023408 017573 Category:Durchmusterung objects Category:NGC objects ","title":"Maia (star)"},{"id":"820580","text":"John Frost may refer to: *John Frost (aviator), member of Early Birds of Aviation *John Frost (British Army officer) (1912‚Äì1993), British army officer, served in Operation Market Garden **John Frost Bridge, Arnhem, named after the army officer *John Frost (Chartist) (1784‚Äì1877), Welsh Chartist **John Frost Square, Newport, named after the Chartist *John Frost (cricketer) (1847‚Äì1916), English cricketer *John Frost (footballer) (born 1980), Irish footballer *John Frost (politician) (1818‚Äì1918), Anglo-South African cabinet minister and landowner *John Frost (producer) (born 1952), Australian theatre producer *John Frost (republican) (1750‚Äì1842), English radical and secretary of the London Corresponding Society *John Frost (SAAF officer) (1918‚Äì1942), highest scoring air ace with a South African Air Force unit *Sir John Frost (physician) (1803‚Äì1840), founder of the Medico-Botanical Society of London, concerning the medical application of plants *John Carver Meadows Frost (1915‚Äì1979), British aircraft designer for the Avro Aircraft Company amongst others *John K.

They play a style of music they call \\"Texican Rock n' Roll,\\" combining elements of rock and roll, Texas blues, brown-eyed soul, country, and Tejano. The band consisted of three brothers: Henry (guitar, vocals), Jojo (bass, vocals), and Ringo (drums, vocals) Garza. They follow the tradition of their father, Ringo Garza, Sr., who formed a band with his brothers called the Falcones. The Falcones played conjunto music in South Texas during the 1970s and 1980s. The debut single for Los Lonely Boys, \\"Heaven\\", was a number-one hit on the Billboard adult contemporary chart and reached the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2004. In 2009, they signed to an Austin-based indie label, Playing in Traffic Records, and released an EP, \\"1969\\" and three albums under their LonelyTone imprint, Keep On Giving: Acoustic Live!, Rockpango, and their newest release, Revelation. ==Musical career== The three brothers emerged as a group in Nashville in the 1990s. After moving back to their home state of Texas, they recorded an album in 2003 in Austin at Willie Nelson's Pedernales recording studio. The album was initially released by Or Music and later acquired by Epic Records for distribution in March 2004. The group's first single, \\"Heaven\\", reached number one on the Adult Contemporary chart, and number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 11 at top 40. \\"Heaven\\" was featured in Guitar Hero: On Tour. In 2005, the song won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Other songs nominated for Grammys include \\"More Than Love\\" and \\"Onda,\\" both in 2006. In 2005, the group recorded \\"I Don't Wanna Lose Your Love\\" with Carlos Santana for the Santana album All That I Am. In June of that year, the group appeared in an episode of CMT's \\"Crossroads\\" show with country music legend Ronnie Milsap. Their 2006 album, Sacred, features the song \\"Outlaws\\". In a \\"closing of the circle\\", Enrique Garza, Sr., sings the verse about the \\"missing outlaws, just like me\\". Willie Nelson, who is credited on the 2004 album, also provided a verse which makes reference to his hit \\"On the Road Again\\". In 2007, Los Lonely Boys participated in Amnesty International's Make Some Noise project. Their cover of John Lennon's \\"Whatever Gets You thru the Night\\" is the second single from the Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The song was released on iTunes on April 17, with the entire album available on June 12 courtesy of Warner Bros. Records. \\"Whatever Gets You thru the Night\\" is noteworthy as John Lennon's only US number-one solo single while he was alive. Their third studio album, Forgiven, was released on July 1, 2008. The album was recorded at East Side Stages in Austin and was produced by Steve Jordan. On October 23, 2008, Los Lonely Boys sang the national anthem to open game two of the 2008 World Series in St. Petersburg, Florida. In March 2009, Los Lonely Boys left Sony/Epic and signed with Austin-based Playing In Traffic Records. In March 2010, the group was awarded \\"Best Rock Band\\" in the Austin Music Awards. The trio released a tribute EP titled \\"1969\\" on October 13, 2009, paying homage to the 40th anniversary of the titular year with covers of Santana's \\"Evil Ways\\", The Doors' \\"Roadhouse Blues\\", Blind Faith's version of Buddy Holly's \\"Well All Right\\", The Beatles' \\"She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\\", and Tony Joe White's \\"Polk Salad Annie\\". The EP was produced by Andy Johns and marked the first release on their new label. Following their 2009-2010 tour, which included roughly 200 shows seen by over 350,000 fans, Los Lonely Boys headed back to the studio to complete their fourth full-length studio album. It was announced on January 14, 2011, that the new album, entitled Rockpango (a Spanglish word that means \\"rock party\\"), would be released on March 29. Rockpango, which features 11 original tracks, marks the first full-length studio album released by the band on their LonelyTone imprint for Playing in Traffic Records. A deluxe edition of the album will include three bonus songs, a behind-the-scenes video, and a fold-out poster of the cover art. In early 2014, Los Lonely Boys released their fifth studio album, Revelation. The album represents new territory for the Boys, with the conjunto touches on \\"Blame It On Love\\" and the reggae groove of \\"Give A Little More\\", among many other new sonic elements. In 2016, the band recorded a cover version of John Fogerty's \\"Born on the Bayou\\", to be included in the project Quiero Creedence. This album, scheduled for July 2016 release, is a tribute to Creedence Clearwater Revival by various Latin recording artists. In October 2019, Los Lonely Boys canceled all upcoming performances after Jojo Garza announced he was leaving the group. The future of the band is uncertain. ==Members== * Henry Garza (b.

This routine‚Äîwhich appeared both on his 1996 HBO special Bring the Pain and as track 12 on his 1997 album Roll with the New‚Äîis widely considered to be the breakthrough routine that established his status as a comedy fixture after he left Saturday Night Live. The routine is a twelve-minute monologue about behaviors that Rock sees in a subset of the country's blacks. He describes \\"niggas\\" as a cohort whose behavior‚Äîwhich embodies many stereotypes‚Äîis usually detrimental to the image of other black people. \\"Niggas\\", he says, glorify ignorance and laziness, and brag about fulfilling any minor responsibility. Rock rejects the view that this image of Blacks is purely cultivated by the media. For instance, in the routine, he says: \\"When I go to the money machine tonight, alright, I ain't looking over my back for the media, I'm looking for niggas! Shit, Ted Koppel ain't never took shit from me. Niggas have, so, you think I've got three guns in my house 'cause the media outside?\\" ==Inspiration== In a 2007 interview, Rock explained that the inspiration for the bit came from the song \\"Us\\" from the 1991 Ice Cube album Death Certificate. ==Retirement== The controversy caused by Rock's constant use of the word \\"nigga\\" led him to remove the rant from his show. In a 2005 60 Minutes interview, Rock said: \\"By the way, I've never done that joke again, ever, and I probably never will.

Woodcut by Johann Christoph Weigel, 1695. Micaiah (Hebrew: ◊û◊ô◊õ◊ô◊î◊ï Mikay'hu \\"Who is like Yah?\\"Peter J. Leithart 1 & 2 Kings 2006 - Page 161 \\"Pressed by Jehoshaphat, Ahab reluctantly brings Micaiah, whose name means ‚Äúwho is like Yah?\\"), son of Imlah, is a prophet in the Hebrew Bible.

Hupat Etivahu, part four, number 47 and not to be confused with Micah, prophet of the Book of Micah. ==Prophecy== The events leading up to the appearance of Micaiah are illustrated in 1 Kings 22:1-12. In 1 Kings 22:1-4, Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah goes to visit the King of Israel (identified later, in 1 Kings 22:20, as Ahab), and asks if he will go with him to take over Ramoth-gilead which was under the rule of the king of Aram. Jehoshaphat the Judahite requests that Ahab the Israelite, ‚ÄúInquire first for the word of the Lord‚Äù (1 Kings 22:5). Ahab then calls on his prophets and asks if he should go into battle against Ramoth-gilead. The prophets responded by telling the king of Israel to go into battle, stating that the Lord (Adonai) will deliver Ramoth-gilead into the hand of the king (1 Kings 22:6). Jehoshaphat asks if there are any other prophets of whom to inquire the word of the Lord (YHWH). Ahab mentions Micaiah the son of Imlah, but expresses dislike for him because his past (1 Kings 20:13-43) prophecies have not been in favor of him (1 Kings 22:7-8). A messenger is sent to bring Micaiah to the king to give his prophecy. The messenger tells Micaiah to give a favorable prophecy to Ahab (1 Kings 22:12-13). Micaiah replies to the messenger that he will speak whatever the Lord says to him (1 Kings 22:14). Micaiah appears before the king of Israel, and when asked if Ahab should go into battle at Ramoth-gilead Micaiah initially responds with a similar prophecy to that of the other prophets in a mocking manner (1 Kings 22:15b). Ahab then questions Micaiah, and insists that he speak nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord. Micaiah then gives a true prophecy, in which he illustrates a meeting of Yahweh with the heavenly hosts. At this meeting Yahweh asks who will entice Ahab to go into battle so that he may perish (1 Kings 22:19-20). A spirit comes forward, and offers to ‚Äúbe a lying spirit in the mouth of the prophets‚Äù (1 Kings 22:22). Therefore, the prophecies of the other prophets were a result of the lying spirit. Zedekiah leader of the 400 prophets who spoke in favor of Ahab strikes Micaiah and claims God speaks through him. As a result of Micaiah's prophecy, Ahab ordered Micaiah imprisoned until he returned from battle, unharmed (1 Kings 22:27). Perhaps concerned about the prophecy, Ahab disguised himself in battle rather than lead his troops openly as their king. However, Ahab was killed in battle after being struck by a randomly shot arrow. Micaiah's prophecy was fulfilled, contrary to the word of 400 false prophets, all of whom encouraged Ahab to attack with a prediction of victory. This account is also recorded in 2 Chronicles, Chapter 18. ==InterpretationRabbinical interpretation=== The Babylonian Talmud (b.Sanhedrin 89a) accepts that the scene literally occurred in heaven. Against this Judah Halevi (Kuzari 3.73) considered the \\"prophecy\\" to be an example of the prophet's own rhetoric.M. Z. Cohen Three Approaches to Biblical Metaphor: From Abraham Ibn Ezra and ... 2003 -Page 159 \\"This role emerges in Radak's comment on I Kgs 22:20, where the prophet Micaiah describes a vision of God on His throne ...

Jewish Bible Quarterly. Jul-Sep 2013, Vol. 41 Issue 3, p. 156-162. David Kimhi argues that \\"prophecy is true by definition\\", the spirit of Lord is often represented as an irrational and emotional response unlike the word of Lord, and following Judah Halevi also critically assesses that Micaiah might have himself presented the vivid scene, using poetic dramatization to frighten and convince Ahab - \\"not that he saw these things, nor did he hear them.\\"Magne Saebo Hebrew Bible, Old Testament: The History of Its Interpretation. 2000, Page 400 \\"On 1 Kgs 22: 19-23, Radak adopts a bolder strategy to avoid a rational dilemma that never distressed the Rabbis. In that passage, the prophet Micaiah, responding to Ahab's false prophets who predicted military success against Aram, describes a vision of God sending a \\"lying spirit\\" to mislead the king. Radak rejects the rabbinic view (b. Sanh. 89 a) that this scene occurred in heaven, arguing that God could not have sent false prophecy, since \\"prophecy is true by definition\\". ... Instead, he argues that Micaiah actually fabricated this vivid scene, using poetic dramatization (divre meliza . . . derekh haza'at devarim) to frighten and thereby prevail upon Ahab.\\" Footnote 39: \\"Radak's (unnamed) as qtd. in Judah Halevi, Kuzari 3.73.\\" Pseudo-Epiphanius (\\"Opera,\\" ii. 245) makes Micah an Ephraimite. Confounding him with Micaiah, son of Imlah (I Kings xxii. 8 et seq.), he states that Micah, for his inauspicious prophecy, was killed by order of Ahab through being thrown from a precipice, and was buried at Morathi (Maroth?; Mic. i. 12), near the cemetery of Enakim (ŒàŒΩŒ±Œ∫Œµ·Ω∂Œº Septuagint rendering of ; ib. i. 10). According to \\"Gelilot Ere·∫ì Yisrael\\" (quoted in \\"Seder ha-Dorot,\\" i. 118, Warsaw, 1889), Micah was buried in Chesil, a town in southern Judah (Josh. xv. 30).Micah Jewish Encyclopedia Naboth's soul was the lying spirit that was permitted to deceive Ahab to his deathAish.com The Lying spirt which deceived Ahab ===Modern scholarly interpretation=== Micaiah prophesies as though he was present at the meeting between Yahweh and the heavenly hosts. Michael Coogan of Harvard compares the prophecy of Micaiah to that of several other prophets, including Isaiah's vision of the Divine Council (Isaiah 6:1-8).Coogan, M. A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in its Context. (Oxford University Press: Oxford 2009), p. 247. In Jeremiah 23, Yahweh warns against false prophecies. However, Coogan argues that unlike Isaiah 6 and Jeremiah 23, in 1 Kings 22 Yahweh's actions to allow false prophecy to be given are deliberate and intentional. It appears as though Yahweh has an ulterior motive, and that is for Ahab to die, in this case at the battle at Ramoth-gilead.Coogan, M.

Dependency dynamics and will of the Lord rooted in foreknowledge is revealed in 1 Kings 21:27-29. ==Heavenly throne room== The prophecy is probably the earliest example in the Hebrew Bible of a representation of a heavenly throne room. It is not clear whether the heavenly throne room represents Micaiah's own belief or a depiction of Ahab's court prophets without discrediting them entirely like the prophet Zedekiah ben Chenaanah, who struck him after his non-populist prophecy (1 Kings 22:24). The focus of voice from the heavenly throne is concerned for the people while Ahab the earthly king's response is self-centered, it reflects the difference in the both approaches, a characteristic of post-exile exemplification in the scripture.Moberly, R.W.L. ‚ÄúDoes God Lie to His Prophets?

The firm was established in 1884 in New York City by Lewis Waterman,\\"pen\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 15th Edition (1998) being one of the few remaining first-generation fountain pen companies, as \\"Waterman S.A.\\" Since 2000 Waterman has been owned by the American group Newell Brands, through its subsidiary, Sanford L.P.. ==History== Lewis Waterman's entry into fountain pen manufacturing has only recently been properly researched. Waterman was working as a pen salesman in New York for a new company founded in the spring of 1883 by a volatile inventor named Frank Holland. Holland abandoned his company after only six weeks; Waterman stepped in and took over, fitting the pens with a simplified feed of his own design. It was for this \\"three fissure feed\\" which his first pen-related patent was granted in 1884. Fountain Pen, February 12, 1884 From the beginning, competition in the fountain pen industry was fierce, both in the marketplace and the courtroom. Despite later company literature that depicts Lewis E. Waterman as a golden-hearted innocent, all evidence indicates that he was a tough, savvy, and innovative businessman. In 1899 the L.E. Waterman Company developed the \\"spoon Feed\\" system which prevented overflow of ink, which also led to the company receiving the gold medal of excellence at the \\"Exposition Universelle\\" in Paris in 1900. Nonetheless, it was after L.E. Waterman's death in 1901 that the company took off. Under the leadership of Waterman's nephew, Frank D. Waterman, the Waterman Pen Company expanded aggressively worldwide. While Waterman introduced its share of innovations, the company's main selling point was always quality and reliability. In 1905 Waterman patented their first permanently attached pen clip, allowing a pen to be held directly in a pocket. In 1908 Waterman released their first retractable-nib \\"safety\\" pen. As the 20th century wore on, Waterman's conservatism allowed its younger and more innovative competitors to gain market share‚ÄîParker, Sheaffer, and Wahl- Eversharp in particular. By the later 1920s, Waterman was attempting to catch up; it continued to struggle through and beyond World War II before finally shutting down in 1954. Waterman's French subsidiary, Waterman-JIF (Jules- Isidore Fagard) later Waterman S.A., continued to prosper, and eventually absorbed what remained of the American company and its British arm. The Waterman company was acquired by the Bic company which went public in 1958 with a reverse merger; Bic would later sell off the Waterman division. Successfully weathering the challenge of the ballpoint pen, it was acquired by The Gillette Company in March 1987 which grew overall sales by 40% with its aggressive North American sales https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/16/business/waterman-rift-a-tearful- farewell.html and later sold to Sanford, a division of Newell Rubbermaid (now known as Newell Brands), along with the Parker Pen Division, which Gillette acquired in 1993. == Pens == Waterman pens made for Air France's Concorde Early Waterman pens were made of hard rubber and were equipped with 14K gold nibs. From early on, precious metal trim and overlays were offered. Many are still in use today, and their nibs are prized for their smoothness and flexibility. Waterman's high production volume from c. 1900 on means that vintage examples are comparatively easy to find today. The most common models from the hard rubber era are the #12 slip-cap eyedropper, the #52 screw-cap lever-filler, and the #42 retracting-nib safety pen. Though largely ignored by present-day collectors, the Waterman C/F of 1953 introduced the modern plastic ink cartridge. In 1983 and celebrating the company's 100th anniversary, Waterman created the Le Man 100, aiming its products at the luxury writing market. Former French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand was known for carrying two wherever he went. Other designs that went on to be a landmark in luxury writing were the Lady Elsa and Lady Patricia contemporary writing pens. As Waterman progressed into the modern era, it produced many of the pens that are still available today including the Edson, the Exception, the Phil√©as, the H√©misph√®re, the Expert, the Harmonie, the Charleston, the Ici et L√†, the Audace, the S√©r√©nit√©, the Liaison, and the Car√®ne. ==See also== * Waterman H√©misph√®re * Waterman Phil√©as * Marcel Bich ==References== ==External links== * Category:Newell Brands Category:Fountain pen and ink manufacturers Category:Ink brands Category:Luxury brands Category:Manufacturing companies based in New York City Category:Manufacturing companies based in Paris Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1884 Category:1958 mergers and acquisitions Category:1987 mergers and acquisitions Category:2000 mergers and acquisitions Category:French brands ","title":"Waterman Pen Company"},{"id":"820638","text":" The Myasishchev M-4 Molot (), USAF/DoD reporting name \\"Type 37\\",http://www.designation-systems.net/non- us/soviet.html#_DOD_Typehttp://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/history/q0070.shtml NATO reporting name Bison\\"Non-US Bomber listings.\\" designation-systems.net. Retrieved: 19 May 2010.) was a four-engined strategic bomber designed by Vladimir Mikhailovich Myasishchev and manufactured by the Soviet Union in the 1950s to provide a Long Range Aviation bomber capable of attacking targets in North America. ==Design and development== A Soviet Myasishchev 3MD in 1982 Following World War II, the Soviet Union prioritized developing a long-range strategic bomber capable of delivering atomic weapons. Their first aircraft was the Tupolev Tu-4, a reverse-engineered version of the American B-29 Superfortress. The Tu-4 was only ever a stop-gap solution, as unlike the American strategic bomber force that could operate from bases in allied countries close to the USSR, it lacked the range to reach the continental United States, and experiences in the Korean War demonstrated piston engine bombers were extremely vulnerable to jet fighter interception. With the advancement of Western jet bombers like the B-47 Stratojet and Vickers Valiant, Vladimir Mikhailovich Myasishchev was directed to construct a strategichesky dalny bombardirovshchik (SDB, \\"strategic long-range bomber\\") in spring of 1951. The first M-4 (Bison-A) prototype flew on 20 January 1953, and was handed over to state acceptance trials in March 1954, with production beginning later that year. It entered service in 1955, with 34 being built including two prototypes.The Myasishchev M-4 / 3M \\"Bison\\" & M-50 \\"Bounder\\". Air Vectors.net. The M-4 was made mostly of aircraft aluminum alloys with some steel and magnesium components. It had wings swept at 35-degrees and powered initially by four Mikulin AM-3A engines with a maximum thrust of 85.8 kN (8,750 kgp; 19,290 lbf), but later upgraded to RD-3M-500 turbojets with a maximum thrust of 93.2 kN (9,500 kgp; 20,940 lbf). There were 18 bladder fuel tanks in the fuselage and wings, providing a total fuel capacity of 123,600 liters (32,610 US gallons); this gave the aircraft a range of , although this fell short of the range initially specified. It had a payload of 24 tonnes (26.4 tons) in various configurations. Defensive armament consisted of six AM-23 23 mm cannons with a rate of fire of 1,250 rpm each in a manned twin tail turret with 400 rounds per gun and two twin remote controlled turrets in the top and bottom fuselage with 300 rounds per gun each. The aircraft had a crew of eight: a navigator/bombardier in the nose; pilot and copilot in the cockpit; radar operator/navigator, flight engineer/gunner, radio operator/gunner, and dorsal turret gunner in a compartment behind the cockpit; and a tail gunner. ===3M=== While the M-4 had less range than the Tupolev Tu-95, it had greater speed and payload, sufficient advantages to continue improving on the design. In 1954, approval was granted for a redesign of the M-4, which flew on 27 March 1956 and began state trials in early 1958. The 3M \\"Bison-B\\" was powered by four Dobrynin RD-7 turbojets, which had the same thrust as the RD-3M but were 25% more fuel efficient; a nose inflight refueling probe was also added to further increase range. The center fuselage was considerably redesigned to reduce weight and improve aerodynamics, and the wings were updated with a wider span and area. 74 Bison-Bs would be built. ===Tanker=== From the outset when the M-4's range shortfall became apparent, Myasishchev began investigating inflight refueling. In 1955, the second production aircraft was modified to a hose-&-drogue tanker configuration and the first production aircraft was fitted with an IFR probe above the nose, with two more converted for trials the following year. From the late 1950s, the M-4 fleet was converted to the tanker configuration through the fit of a hose-drum unit (HDU) and fuel tanks in the bomb bay and removal of all defensive armament. Similar conversions were performed to the 3M fleet in the 1970s and 1980s, the 3MS-1 \\"Bison-B\\" becoming the \\"3MS-2\\" tanker and the 3MN-1 becoming the \\"3MN-2\\" tanker. ==Operational history== Tomcat intercepting a Myasishchev 3M, 1983 The M-4 was first displayed to the public in Red Square, on May Day, 1954. The aircraft was a surprise to the United States, which had not known that the Soviets had built a jet bomber. However, it soon became clear that the bomber had an insufficient range to attack the United States and still return to the Soviet Union. Only a few of the original production M-4s were actually put into service. To remedy this problem, the Myasishchev design bureau introduced the 3M, known to the West as the 'Bison-B', which was considerably more powerful than the previous version. This new model first flew in 1955. Among other things, two of the five original gun barbettes were removed to lighten the aircraft. In July 1955 American observers saw 28 Bisons in two groups during a Soviet air show. The United States government believed that the bomber was in mass production, and the Central Intelligence Agency estimated that 800 would be available by 1960. The display was a hoax; the first group of ten repeated the flyby with eight more. The classified estimates led, however, to American politicians warning of a \\"bomber gap\\". This time, it was not the Soviet Air Force (VVS) that wanted the 3M, but rather Naval Aviation (AV-MF). Though it could still not bomb Washington, D.C., the 3M had a sufficient range to fulfill the need for a long-range maritime patrol aircraft. In 1959, the 3M broke numerous world records for payload to height, including to and to . However, it was thought by the West (and would continue to be thought until 1961) that the 3M was the original M-4, meaning that the capability of the M-4 was vastly overestimated by Western intelligence agencies. In the early 1960s, the 'Bison-C', with a specialized search radar, was introduced. By this time, many of the original M-4s had been converted to M-4-2 fuel tankers for aerial refueling. Later, 3Ms were converted to 3MS-2 and 3MN-2 tankers as well. Neither the M-4 nor the 3M ever saw combat, and none were ever converted for low-altitude attack, as many American B-52s were, nor were any ever exported to the Soviet Union's allies. Production of the Bison aircraft stopped in 1963, by which time 93 of them had been built. The last aircraft, an M-4-2 fuel tanker, was withdrawn from service in 1994. The three VM-T heavy lift aircraft were converted from 3MN-2 tankers, with very large loads carried piggy-back above the fuselage. The single vertical fin/rudder was replaced with two large rectangular fin/rudders at the tips of the horizontal stabilizers to improve control due to the turbulence caused by the cargo pod. With the withdrawal of the Myasishchev bombers and tankers the vast majority of the retired airframes were broken up under the terms of the relevant arms limitation treaty. ==Variants== Ukrainka Airbase, Amur Oblast A Myasishchev 3M in 1968 Side-view silhouette scraps of Myasishchev M-4 / 3M variant noses * Izdeliye M (Product M) ‚Äì the in-house designation for the SDB, Project 25, M-4 aircraft.Gordon 2003 * SDB (Strategichesky Dalny Bombardirovshchik ‚Äì strategic long-range bomber) ‚Äì The government designation for the M-4 programme. * [Tema Dvadtsat Pyat] Subject 25 ‚Äì The VVS designation for the strategic bomber program. * Myasishchev M-4 ‚Äì The designation used for production aircraft. 35 built including two prototypes and a static test article.

He retired from the army in 1968. ==Early life and military career== John Dutton Frost was born in Poona, British India, on 31 December 1912. He was the son of Frank Dutton Frost, a British Army officer, and his wife, Elsie Dora (n√©e Bright). He was educated, initially, at Wellington College, Berkshire, before transferring to Monkton Combe School, Somerset, due to lack of progress at the former, and followed in his father's footsteps and joined the British Army on 1 September 1932, when on graduation from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles). He was promoted on 1 September 1935 to lieutenant. Frost served with his regiment's 2nd Battalion, then commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Riddell-Webster, in the United Kingdom before the battalion, now commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas Graham, was sent to Palestine during the early stages of the Arab revolt. From 1938 to 1941 Frost worked with the Iraq Levies, receiving a promotion to captain on 1 September 1940, ==Second World WarReturn to the United Kingdom=== Returning to the United Kingdom in September 1941, Frost initially served with the 10th Battalion, Cameronians, a Territorial Army (TA) unit which formed part of the 45th Brigade of Major-General Philip Christison's 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, before later volunteering to join the Parachute Regiment in the same year. He was posted to the 2nd Parachute Battalion, part of Brigadier Richard Gale's 1st Parachute Brigade, itself forming part of the 1st Airborne Division, whose General Officer Commanding (GOC) was Major-General Frederick Browning. ===Operation Biting=== Frost distinguished himself in Operation Biting, a raid to dismantle and steal the radar dish or components of the German W√ºrzburg radar at Bruneval. The raid was the second time the fledgling British parachute regiment was called on. C Company under the then Major Frost was given the task and on 27 February 1942 120 men landed. They met stiff opposition but succeeded in stealing the component as well as capturing a German radar technician. The operation lost three men killed and seven badly wounded. Prime Minister Winston Churchill applauded the raid and guaranteed further wartime operations for the paratroopers.Battle of Arnhem Frost was awarded the Military Cross. ===North Africa=== During the Allied landings in North Africa British airborne units landed in Tunisia, which included the 1st Para Brigade, which was detached from the rest of the division and now commanded by Brigadier Edwin Flavell. At this time Frost, who was now an acting lieutenant-colonel and in command of his battalion, was tasked to attack enemy airfields near Depienne 30 miles south of Tunis. The airfields were found to be abandoned and the armour column they were supposed to meet up with at Oudna never arrived, leaving Frost's battalion 50 miles behind enemy lines. Heavily outnumbered and continuously attacked on their route out, they managed to fight their way back to Allied lines but lost 16 officers and 250 men. The battalion carried on fighting with the British First Army through to Tunis. For this action he was awarded his first Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 11 February 1943. ===Sicily and Italy=== In 1943 Frost's battalion, with the rest of the 1st Parachute Brigade, now under Brigadier Gerald Lathbury, was landed in Sicily during Operation Husky with orders to capture a road bridge called Ponte di Primosole. The brigade was hopelessly scattered and the 295 officers and men who reached the bridge found themselves facing the German 4th Parachute Regiment and lost the bridge until the arrival of other Eighth Army units. Frost's last action in this theatre was in Italy when the entire 1st Airborne Division, now commanded by Major-General Ernest Down (but replaced in January 1944 by Major-General Roy Urquhart) after Major- General George F. Hopkinson was killed in September 1943, landed at Taranto by sea. ===Operation Market Garden=== Frost is best known for his involvement in the Battle of Arnhem during Operation Market Garden. During this battle Frost was to spearhead the 1st Airborne Division's assault on the bridge at Arnhem and hold it while the rest of the division made its way there. If all had gone to plan there would have been almost 9,000 men1st Airborne Division Constitution holding Arnhem bridge for the two days it was supposed to take Lieutenant-General Brian Horrocks's XXX Corps to reach them. On 17 September 1944, as commander of the 2nd Parachute Battalion, Frost led a mixed group of about 745 lightly armed men who landed near Oosterbeek and marched into Arnhem. The battalion reached the bridge capturing the northern end, but Frost then found that his force was surrounded by the II.SS-Panzerkorps and cut off from the rest of 1st Airborne. Frost was in command during the fierce four-day battle that followed, in which the Germans rained artillery fire onto the paratroopers' positions, and sent tanks and infantry into some of the most intense fighting seen by either side, with very little mercy given. The Germans were greatly surprised by the airborne forces' refusal to surrender and their continuous counterattacks. After a short truce on the third day, when 250 wounded were removed, the battle continued until the remaining paratroopers had run out of ammunition. There were around one hundred paratroopers left. As a result of this action, during which he was wounded by shrapnel in his feet, Frost became a legendary figure in the Parachute Regiment and the British Army. > In action, Frost was a tough leader whose clear head in battle won the > respect of every Paratrooper in the battalion. \\"He didn't mix his words and > seemed to inject confidence in everyone, even if you didn't like what he > said. We would have followed him anywhere\\" said one Para. Following capture, Frost was held as a prisoner of war in Oflag IX-A/H at Spangenberg castle. He was later moved to a hospital in Obermassfeldt. Frost was liberated when the area was overrun by American troops in March 1945. On 20 September 1945, he awarded a Bar to his DSO for his leadership at Arnhem. ==Later life== Frost remained in the army after the war, during which time he commanded the 1st Airborne Division's Battle School and returned from Norway with the division, still under Major-General Urquhart, back to the United Kingdom, where it was disbanded. He later returned to the 2nd Parachute Battalion, which still formed part of the 1st Parachute Brigade but was transferred to the 6th Airborne Division. Frost led his old battalion during the Palestine Emergency (see 6th Airborne Division in Palestine). While in Palestine he met his future wife, Jean McGregor Lyle, who was there as a welfare worker; they married on 31 December 1947 and had two children, a son and a daughter. Returning to England in late 1946, he attended the Staff College, Camberley, and, after graduating, became a General Staff Officer Grade 2 (GSO2) with the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, a TA formation, before serving as a GSO1 with the 17th Gurkha Division during the Malayan Emergency. Returning to the United Kingdom, he was, from 1955 to 1957, in command of the Support Weapons Wing of the School of Infantry. He then commanded the 44th Parachute Brigade, another TA formation, composed of part- time soldiers, before receiving promotion to temporary major-general on 11 October 1961, and returning to the 52nd Division, this time as its GOC, a post he would hold for nearly three years. By the time of his retirement from the army in 1968, Frost had attained the permanent rank of major-general and in addition to his wartime decorations, had been appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1964 New Year Honours. In 1982, Frost was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant in the County of West Sussex. He was the subject of an episode of the television programme This Is Your Life on 6 April 1977. Frost died on 21 May 1993 at the age of 80. He was buried at Milland Cemetery, in West Sussex. ==Biographies, memorials and depiction in the media== The John Frost Bridge, as seen from the memorial. In 1945, the British Army Film and Photographic Unit (AFPU) and J. Arthur Rank Organisation initiated production on a documentary feature film, under the title Theirs is the Glory, about Operation Biting/the Battle of Arnhem, directed by Brian Desmond Hurst. The film included fictionalised recreations of events from the battle. John Frost was among 120 Arnhem veterans who played themselves in many scenes.Middlebrook, p.446 In 1974, Frost's role at Arnhem featured prominently in Cornelius Ryan's best-selling non-fictional book A Bridge Too Far. In 1976, Frost acted as a military consultant to Richard Attenborough's film adaptation of Ryan's book. In the film Frost was portrayed by Anthony Hopkins. The bridge over the Rhine at Arnhem was renamed John Frostbrug (\\"John Frost Bridge\\") in his honour in 1978, despite Frost's reported reluctance. ==Other works== *1980: A Drop Too Many ‚Äì autobiography (part 1) *1983: 2 PARA Falklands: The Battalion At War *1991: Nearly There ‚Äì autobiography (part 2) ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== *1st British Airborne Division officers *Imperial War Museum Interview from 1979 *Imperial War Museum Interview from 1987 *John Frost's appearance on This Is Your Life Category:1912 births Category:1993 deaths Category:British Army generals Category:British Army personnel of the Malayan Emergency Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:British military personnel of the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine Category:British military personnel of the Palestine Emergency Category:British Parachute Regiment officers Category:British World War II prisoners of war Category:Cameronians officers Category:Companions of the Distinguished Service Order Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:Deputy Lieutenants of West Sussex Category:Graduates of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst Category:Graduates of the Staff College, Camberley Category:People educated at Monkton Combe School Category:People educated at Wellington College, Berkshire Category:People from Pune Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:World War II prisoners of war held by Germany ","title":"John Frost (British Army officer)"},{"id":"820695","text":" USS Ganges was a man-of-war in the United States Navy during the Quasi- War with France. She was originally a fast sailing merchantman, built in Philadelphia in 1794 for the East Indies trade and named for the Ganges, India's principal river, which flows into the Bay of Bengal. Ganges regularly sailed to Calcutta and Canton. Apparently she returned to civilian service after serving in the U.S. Navy between 1798 and 1801. ==Service history== She retained her merchant name when the U.S. Navy purchased her from the firm of Willing and Francis of Philadelphia on 3 May 1798. She cost $58,000 or $80,665, depending on the source. With hostilities with France imminent, the Navy hastily fitted her out, making her the first man-of-war to fit out and get to sea under the second organization of the Navy. In Navy service she is described as being of 504 tons, and carrying 24 guns and a crew of 220 men. Her first captain was Captain Richard Dale, who had returned in her from a voyage to China.Hobart, John Henry. (1911) The correspondence of John Henry Hobart. (New York: Merrymount), Vol. II, p. 82. ===1798=== Ganges sailed from Philadelphia on 24 May 1798 under Richard Dale, whose orders directed him to \\"seize, take and bring into a port of the United States\\" French armed ships \\"committing depredations\\" within one marine league of the coast between the Capes of Virginia and Long Island. On 13 July, further orders authorized her to take any French armed ship wherever found, but she continued patrol between Cape Henry and Long Island for the protection of the large seaport cities. On 30 July, Ganges was directed to return to Philadelphia for refitting, but put into New York City instead because of fever and plague at Philadelphia. In mid-September 1798, Captain Thomas Tingey relieved Captain Dale and, on 7 December, his ship was ordered to the Windward Passage between Cuba and Hispaniola to join the squadron protecting the Jamaican trade. Cruising in these waters with General Pinkney and South Carolina, she guarded American merchantmen from seizure by French naval vessels, privateers, and \\"all armed vessels acting without commission.\\" ===1799=== On 6 January 1799, off the Island of Tortuga, Ganges fell in with the sloop Ceres, off her course for no apparent reason and suspected of heading for illegal trade at Cap Fran√ßais. Tingey detained the captain of Ceres, questioned him, and reported to intelligence. The incident occasioned the following passage from Tingey's letter of concern to Benjamin Stoddert, the Secretary of the Navy: On 21 February, officers of the 28-gun English frigate boarded Ganges off Cape Nichola Mole, Hispaniola, and demanded all Englishmen aboard. Tingey firmly replied: The crew gave three cheers, ran to quarters, and called for \\"Yankee Doodle\\". Surprise departed. Having returned home for repairs in March, Ganges convoyed Kingston, carrying American Consul General Dr. Edward Stevens, to talk with Toussaint Louverture in Haiti. She then cruised the Caribbean from Havana to Puerto Rico, St. Thomas, St. Kitts, St. Bartholomew's, Santo Domingo, Barbuda, and Jamaica. On 21 April off Cape Isabella she seized the American sloop Mary, of Norwich, for illegal trading. That same day she recaptured the American ship Eliza of Charleston. The French privateer Telemaque, Captain Arnault, had captured her and she was sailing under a prize crew. Ganges sent the two vessels together to Philadelphia. On 16 June, Ganges, with Norfolk, captured the 8-gun French privateer Vainquere (formerly British Harlequin) off Saint Bartholomews after a 90-mile chase lasting more than eight hours and requiring the expenditure of some 40 cannon shot. The privateer's crew numbered some 85 men. The prize sailed to Norfolk under Captain Pitcher. The hurricane season approached and it was thought Ganges should return to the United States, but Tingey proudly reported his ship could withstand the Caribbean storms: On 5 August, Ganges captured the 6-gun schooner La Rabateuse after a 12-hour chase in which the privateer threw overboard all her guns and endured 13 cannon shot before surrendering. On 16 August Ganges retook the American schooner John, laden with sugar and cotton, from the French. Three days later, Ganges captured a small French \\"letter of marque\\" off St. Thomas. She later captured L'Eugene with 28 men and on 2 October recaptured the American schooner Laurel, which the French had renamed L'Esperance. Ganges returned to Philadelphia in the fall and Captain John Mullowny relieved Captain Tingey on 16 November. That December, she sailed for the West Indies, again convoying American merchantmen until May 1800, when she returned to the States. ===1800=== On 25 May 1800, Captain Mullowny received orders to proceed to Havana, and Ganges shortly departed Philadelphia for another eventful cruise. On 19 July, she captured the schooner Prudent off the coast of Cuba; on the 20th recaptured American brigantine Dispatch; and the 21st, the third successful day in a row, took schooner Phoebe. On 28 July, Ganges captured French privateer La Fortune et Louis. In September, her crew ridden with fever, she returned to the United States. The Phoebe and the Prudent were two illegal U.S. slave schooners. Ganges brought them to Fort Mifflin in Philadelphia as prizes. Mullowny chose Philadelphia because of the city's strong anti-slavery sentiments. The 135 Africans on board were detained at the Lazaretto for 31 days while their legal status was established. During their stay, the staff of the Lazaretto nursed the emaciated and diseased slaves back to health. The Pennsylvania Abolition Society took guardianship of the Africans, gave them the last name \\"Ganges\\" and dispersed them locally via indentures. Apparently most eventually became part of Pennsylvania's population of free blacks. ===1801=== Sailing again 31 January 1801, Ganges proceeded with a convoy for Havana. En route she was severely damaged by a storm and put into Basseterre, St. Christopher. Here, Commodore John Barry surveyed the ship on 2 March and found her \\"unfit for sea.\\" Being unable to continue her voyage, Ganges remained on the Guadeloupe station until May, then proceeded north with a convoy that reached Philadelphia early in June. On 10 June 1801, under provision of the Peace Establishment Act, the Navy agent at Philadelphia prepared Ganges for sale. She was sold prior to 8 December for $21,000. The Navy was reduced to thirteen vessels and the Ganges again became a merchant ship. ==People associated with Ganges== One of the passengers abroad the Ganges when it arrived at Philadelphia on 31 March 1806 had an Indian surname, Singh.The History of the Early Arrivals of Asian Indians to America Officers and midshipmen of Ganges included several future heroes such as Thomas Macdonough, James Lawrence, Jacob Jones, and Daniel Carmick. ==References== * Category:Sloops of the United States Navy Category:Quasi-War ships of the United States Category:1794 ships ","title":"USS Ganges (1794)"},{"id":"820698","text":"Deuteros: The Next Millennium is the sequel to the sci-fi strategy video game Millennium 2.2, published by Activision for the Amiga and Atari ST. Ian Bird designed and wrote the game, with graphics by Jai Redman and music by Matt Bates. == Overview == While the game shares themes of space exploration and resource gathering - plus some elements of its interface - with its predecessor, the two are different in gameplay. The object of Deuteros is to mine and manage resources, explore the Solar System and beyond. For this, 3 categories of civilians are trained: Producers, Researchers and Marines, out of a pool of 6000 population. The longer these teams are used, they are advanced in three levels, required for some later action (some inventions can be manufactured only by a producer who is at \\"Expert\\" level while Pilots with the rank of \\"Admiral\\" will be more effective in battles). New bases built on other planets must be manned with new teams of Producers in order to construct the shuttles and derricks needed for supply. Some of these events are \\"milestones\\" which will trigger new technology to be researched by the scientists. The player has to take care mostly of the transaction between the planets and the factories and distribute their supply with shuttles and long- range spacecraft. New technology (such as automation computers or teleport) will replace some of the player's involvement, as the player must later concentrate on war. ==Scenario== The game is set some 800 years after Millennium, in a time when mankind has won the struggle to make the Earth habitable again but lost its spacefaring capabilities, when the Martians, moments before they were defeated in Mars, hid a small robotic fleet just when Earth was re-settled, and destroying the Moon Base moments before humans returned to earth as a final deed of vengeance. 8 centuries later, the humans attempt to reach space travel again and rediscover old secrets. Initially the player has Earth resources with which he can build ships and orbital factories. The first factory will give the player the technology to make IOSs (interplanetary operations spacecraft) which he can build orbital factories over selected planets and moons of the solar system. First the player can use the IOS to extract material from asteroids not found on Earth (such as silver, platinum etc.), and later build bases on the selected planets with the orbital factories so that exotic material is steadily produced. In the process the player will meet the Methanoids, colonists from the first game who declared independence when Earth was re-settled. Now they dominate Trans-Neptunian space and act secretively, only allowing the player to swap mined goods for materials they need. ===War=== Once the player builds a sixth orbital factory (or gets the methanoid laser from trading a lot with the methanoids), the Methanoids will declare war, and in the process the player will have to research and manufacture battle drones and also copy the self-destruct mechanism of the enemies. A teleport system (for inanimate objects) will be discovered that will eliminate the need for supply IOSs. Once the player conquers all of the solar system, they will discover some alien messages and a blueprint for faster-than-light travel. New technology will allow the player to construct SCGs (star-class galleons) and travel to Proxima Centauri, the first of the seven star systems that have to be conquered. In the process the technology \\"Hyperspace travel\\" will be acquired. Winning requires conquering 8 systems and collecting of 8 parts of a mysterious machine scattered by Methanoids. Upon winning, the game ends with a mini video clip that shows three picture-slots with icons and pictures of in-game objects changing every 3 seconds accompanied by the main music of the game. ==Critical reception== Deuteros was critically well received. Amiga Format awarded 95%, Amiga Power gave 89%, CU Amiga gave 70% and Zero awarded 92%. ==Remakes== A PC remake exists in the beta stage of development.http://bartfernhout.magix.net/public/deuteros.html/ ==References== == External links == * * Deuteros at dixiak.com Category:1991 video games Category:Activision games Category:Amiga games Category:Atari ST games Category:Cancelled DOS games Category:Strategy video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"Deuteros"},{"id":"820730","text":"Josef Gingold (Russian: –ò–æ—Å–∏—Ñ –ì–∏–Ω–≥–æ–ª—å–¥; January 11, 1995) was a Belarusian- Jewish-born classical violinist and teacher, who lived most of his life in the United States.

His health was reportedly poor and he was often sent to the hill station of Landour near Mussoorie in the Lower Himalaya for convalescence, at the time about 4 days' journey. He would remain for weeks at a time in Landour at a grand hilltop building called The Castle, which had been lavishly furnished to accommodate him. ===Conversion to Christianity=== Duleep Singh, in ceremonial dress, 1852, by the English painter George Duncan Beechey Maharaja Duleep Singh in durbar on a terrace with Labh Singh and Tej Singh and an attendant Lahore, circa 1850 In 1853, under the tutelage of his long-time retainer Bhajan Lal (himself a Christian convert), he converted to Christianity at Fatehgarh with the approval of the Governor-General Lord Dalhousie. His conversion remains controversial, and it occurred before he turned 15. He later had serious doubts and regrets regarding this decision and reconverted to Sikhism in 1886. He was also heavily and continuously exposed to Christian texts under the tutelage of the devout Sir John Spencer Login. His two closest childhood friends were both English Anglican missionaries. In May 1854 he was sent into exile in Britain. ==Life in exileLondon=== Duleep Singh (1838‚Äì1893) in 1854; portrait by Franz Xaver WinterhalterDuleep Singh's arrival on the shores of England in late 1854 threw him into the British court. Queen Victoria showered affection upon the turbaned Maharaja, as did the Prince Consort. Duleep Singh was initially lodged at Claridge's Hotel in London before the East India Company took over a house in Wimbledon and then eventually another house in Roehampton which became his home for three years. He was also invited by the Queen to stay with the Royal Family at Osborne, where she sketched him playing with her children and Prince Albert photographed him, while the court artist, Winterhalter, made his portrait.Maharaja Dalip Singh in London Victoria & Albert Museum. He eventually got bored with Roehampton and expressed a wish to go back to India but it was suggested by the East India Company Board he take a tour of the European continent which he did with Sir John Spencer Login and Lady Login. He was a member of the Photographic Society, later the Royal Photographic Society, from 1855 until his death.http://rpsmembers.dmu.ac.uk/rps_results.php?mid=540 Accessed 6 July 2014 ===Castle Menzies=== Sir Duleep Singh in the 1860s On his return from Continental Europe in 1855 he was given an annual pension, and was officially under ward of Sir John Spencer Login and Lady Login, who leased Castle Menzies in Perthshire, Scotland, for him. He spent the rest of his teens there but at 19 he demanded to be in charge of his household. Eventually, he was given this and an increase in his annual pension. In 1859 Lt Col James Oliphant was installed as Equerry to the Maharaja at the recommendation of Sir John Login. Oliphant was to be a possible replacement should anything happen to the Maharaja's most trusted friend Sir John Login (who did indeed die four years later in 1863).Sir John Login and Duleep Singh ===Reunion with his mother=== Maharaja Sir Duleep Singh in ceremonial dress, 1861 When he was 18, Singh wrote to his mother in Kathmandu, suggesting that she should join him in Great Britain, but his letter was intercepted by the British in India and did not reach her. He then sent a courier, Pundit Nehemiah Goreh, who was also intercepted and forbidden to contact the Maharani. Duleep Singh then decided to go himself. Under cover of a letter from Login he wrote to the British Resident in Kathmandu, who reported that the Maharani had 'much changed, was blind and had lost much of the energy which formerly characterised her.' The British decided she was no longer a threat and she was allowed to join her son on 16 January 1861 at Spence‚Äôs Hotel in Calcutta and return with him to England. ===Auchlyne and Aberfeldy=== In 1858 the lease of Castle Menzies expired and Duleep Singh rented the house at Auchlyne from the Earl of Breadalbane. He was known for a lavish lifestyle, shooting parties, and a love of dressing in Highland costume and soon had the nickname \\"the Black Prince of Perthshire\\".On the trail of the Sikh heritage BBC News, September 30, 2008. (At the same time, he was known to have gradually developed a sense of regret for his circumstances in exile, including some inner turmoil about his conversion to Christianity and his forced departure from the Punjab). His mother stayed in Perthshire with him for a short time, before he rented the Grantully Estate, near Aberfeldy. Following the deaths of his mother and Sir John Login in 1863, he returned to England. \\"The 'Black Prince' of Perthshire\\", Highlander Web ===Elveden Estate=== Maharaja Duleep Singh (as he became in June 1861) bought (or the India Office purchased for him) a 17,000 acre (69 km¬≤) country estate at Elveden on the border between Norfolk and Suffolk, close to Thetford, in 1863. He enjoyed living in Elveden Hall and the surrounding area and restored the church, cottages, and school.

Though previous efforts were thwarted by his handlers, he reestablished contact with his cousin Sardar Thakar Singh Sandhawalia, who on 28 September 1884 left Amritsar for England along with his sons Narinder Singh and Gurdit Singh and a Sikh granthi (priest), Pratap Singh Giani. He also brought a list of properties held by Sir Duleep Singh in India. All this renewed his connection with Sikhism.He prepared the exiled Maharaja to seek to wrest back his lost empire The Tribune, September 21, 2002. The British Government decided in 1886 against his return to India or his re- embracing Sikhism. Despite protests from the India Office, he set sail for 'home' on 30 March 1886. However, he was intercepted and arrested in Aden, then part of Aden Settlement, where the writ of the Viceroy of India began. He could not be stopped from an informal re-conversion ceremony in Aden, far less grand and symbolic than it would have been in India, done by emissaries sent by Sardar Thakar Singh Sandhawalia, who was earlier planning the Pahaul ceremony at Bombay. Sir Duleep was forced to return to Europe. ==Death== H.H. Maharaja Maharaja Duleep Singh on Butten Island, Thetford Maharaja Duleep Singh died in Paris in 1893 at the age of 55, having seen India after the age of fifteen during only two brief, tightly controlled visits in 1860 (to bring his mother to England) and in 1863 (to cremate his mother's body). Maharaja Duleep Singh's wish for his body to be returned to India was not honoured, in fear of unrest, given the symbolic value the funeral of the son of the Lion of the Punjab might have caused and the growing resentment of British rule. His body was brought back to be buried according to Christian rites, under the supervision of the India Office, in Elveden Church beside the grave of his wife Maharani Bamba, and his son Prince Edward Albert Duleep Singh. The graves are located on the west side of the Church. A life-size bronze statue of the Maharaja, showing him on a horse, was unveiled by H.R.H.

Maharani Bamba M√ºller was an Arabic-speaking, part-Ethiopian, part-German woman, whose father was a German banker and whose mother was an Abyssinian Coptic Christian slave. She and Sir Duleep met in Cairo in 1863 on his return from scattering his mother's ashes in India; they were married in Alexandria, Egypt, on 7 June 1864. The Maharani died in London on 18 September 1887. ===Ada Douglas Wetherill=== Some sources describe Ada Douglas Wetherill as a French princess. Wetherill had been Duleep's mistress before he decided to return to India with his family, and upon being stopped in Aden by the British authorities he abandoned his family and moved to Paris, where she joined him. She stayed with him through his years in Paris and also travelled with him to St. Petersburg, Russia, where he failed to persuade the Czar of the benefits of invading India through the north and reinstalling him as ruler.Russia‚Äôs onward march; progress in Asia and India is her goal.

Gaydon has one pub called the Malt Shovel. The Gaydon Inn, which is being redeveloped for housing, stands close to the point of intersection of the two roads. The village centre is situated along a short loop south of the junction. The Gaydon Inn was famous in the 18th century for its association with violent highwaymen. The Malt Shovel pub, together with the adjacent community shop, is located off Church Road and is now the only commercial enterprise in the village. The Manor House on Kineton Road dates back to the 17th century. Although Gaydon has become something of a commuter village because of its proximity to the M40, which was completed in January 1991, it is undergoing a revival by looking back at its roots, agriculture and community spirit.

While not officially recognized as a sport, it is typically an outdoor activity. The equipment consists of a stationary metal pole, from which is hung a volleyball from a rope or tether. The two players stand on opposite sides of the pole. Each player tries to hit the ball one way; one clockwise, and one counterclockwise. The game ends when one player manages to wind the ball all the way around the pole so that it is stopped by the rope. It must not bounce. An early variant described in Jessie H. Bancroft's 1909 book Games for the Playground... involves a tethered tennis ball hit by racquets, with similar rules of the game. The game begins when one player enters the court and yells \\"Sides and ways\\" then serves the ball in the direction he or she chooses (provided that person yelled it first), usually by hitting it off the post, or after the opposing player serves it, he or she cannot touch it until the other player touches it. The opposing player then attempts to return the serve by hitting it in the opposite direction. The object is to hit the ball in such a way that one's opponent will be unable to alter the ball's direction. This gives the server an advantage since the server has more control over the ball from the beginning. It is generally acceptable to hit the ball with either the fist or the open hand or swing. A player commits a violation if he/she steps onto his opponent's half of the pole, by touching the rope instead of the ball, hitting the ball before it has either circled the pole or been returned by the opponent or, in some variants, struck the pole. Generally, after a violation occurs, the game pauses and the person who committed the violation is out; the number of wraps around the pole is re-created (or a penalty-wrap is awarded to the player who did not commit the foul). The player who did not commit the violation then serves the ball. If, however, the violation appears to be intentional, it may result in loss of game. One variation legalizes throws and double hits. The game ends when one player hits the ball around the pole in their own direction as far as it will go, so that the ball hits the pole. In addition, the ball must strike the pole with the final wrap above a line marked on the pole. A mark is satisfactory, though a lower mark might be used for younger players. A match can go on for at least 2 or more games. If a player breaks any of these rules he/she is out and it is the next person's turn to play the winner. If played with only two people, the \\"loser\\" now gets his/her turn to serve to even out the odds for their win. ==Equipment== Georgetown neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, 2013 Tetherball requires a stationary pole, a rope, and a ball. The ball is roughly the size and weight of a volleyball, but is somewhat firmer unless a soft tetherball is specifically purchased. Tetherballs usually have a bar recessed in the top that the rope is tied to. Some simply have loops that protrude out, but this is less common as striking the loop with the hand can be painful. The pole is often high, and can be as low as high depending upon the height of the players.http://www.livestrong.com/article/170030-tetherball-pole-regulations/ To keep the pole stationary, it is either anchored down by using a concrete- filled tire or a blow molded plastic base filled with sand or water or in some cases concrete, or is embedded in the ground. The rope is generally slender nylon, and is long enough so that the ball hangs about above the ground. Tetherball is played on many surfaces, including sand, gravel, lawn, and asphalt. ==See also== *Totem tennis or swingball, a similar game with a tethered tennis or sponge ball hit with racquets. ==References== Category:Ball games Category:Individual sports Category:Playground equipment Category:1970s fads and trends ","title":"Tetherball"},{"id":"820883","text":"Queensborough Bridge is a highway bridge in New Westminster, British Columbia.

They are often recognized as one of the first bands of the grunge era.Tad biography. Allmusic ==HistoryFormation and Sub Pop years (1988‚Äì1991)=== Led by Tad Doyle (b. Thomas Andrew Doyle) on vocals and guitar, Tad was formed in early 1988 by Doyle, a drummer turned guitar player/singer, who asked bassist Kurt Danielson to play bass for the band. Danielson's band Bundle of Hiss played with Doyle's previous band (in which he played drums) H-Hour. Tad recruited drummer Steve Wied (formerly of Skin Yard) and guitarist Gary Thorstensen to complete the original lineup. Tad was among the first bands to be signed to the independent label Sub Pop Records. In 1988, Doyle had released the \\"Daisy/Ritual Device\\" single on Sub Pop, produced by seminal Seattle producer Jack Endino, for which Doyle wrote and performed all music. Tad's debut album God's Balls appeared in early 1989 and was also produced by Endino. In March 1990 the band released the Salt Lick EP, recorded by Steve Albini. It contained the song \\"Wood Goblins\\", for which a music video was produced. After a European tour with Nirvana, Tad returned to Seattle and recorded their second album 8-Way Santa (1991), named after a type of blotter acid. Produced by Butch Vig, the album was far more pop-oriented than its predecessors, and featured the singles \\"Jinx\\" and \\"Jack Pepsi\\". \\"Jack Pepsi\\" was released as a single, but Pepsi filed a lawsuit against the band due to the cover art on the single, which was the Pepsi logo with \\"Tad\\" in place of \\"PEPSI.\\" However, the so-called \\"Pepsi logo\\" was missing the left and right colorations in the actual Pepsi logo, one being of a light blue color; said light blue color never appeared on the Tad artwork, making this at best an attempt at \\"folk art\\", not even coming close to \\"copyright infringement\\". Another lawsuit was filed due to the cover of 8-Way Santa (which was a found picture of a man fondling a woman's breast). The couple in the photograph, one of whom had since become a born-again Christian and remarried, took exception and sued. Sub Pop subsequently changed the album cover to a shot of the band. ===Major label years, turmoil and breakup (1992‚Äì1999)=== After a very brief acting stint in Singles, Tad was offered its first major-label opportunity by Warner Music Group's Giant Records. However, Steve Wied had left, joining Willard, and later Foil. Rey Washam (formerly of Scratch Acid) briefly filled on drums in 1991 but was later replaced by Josh Sinder, previously of The Acc√ºsed. Sinder debuted with Tad on their last Sub-Pop release, the \\"Salem/Leper\\" single (which featured \\"Mud-Man,\\" Josh's apparently mumps-afflicted brother, on the cover). Their major label debut Inhaler appeared later in the year to positive reviews. The record failed to break the band however, even though they were chosen to open for Soundgarden on their 1994 Superunknown tour. Giant Records quickly got cold feet and dropped the band when a poster promoting Inhaler surfaced featuring Bill Clinton smoking a joint with the caption reading \\"It's heavy shit\\". In 1995, the band released Live Alien Broadcasts on Futurist Records, which was a best-of live studio recording. Thorstensen left but they secured a second major-label deal with East West/Elektra Records, another Warner label, in 1995. They released their fifth album Infrared Riding Hood. However, within a month of the release, the band's Artists and repertoire representative was fired. As a result of that representative's termination, all of their signed bands were released and their albums ceased production, regardless of content. They continued to gig for the remainder of the year before Sinder left to form the Hot Rod Lunatics. He was replaced on drums by Mike Mongrain of Foil. Tad's final single \\"Oppenheimer's Pretty Nightmare/Accident on the Way to Church\\" appeared in 1998 on Up Records. A year later the band dissolved. ===Post- breakup (2000‚Äì2012)=== Following Tad's breakup, Doyle formed Hog Molly in 2001 with Willard bassist Ty Garcia and 50 Paces guitarist Martin Chandler, releasing the album Kung-Fu Cocktail Grip late the same year. Willard guitarist Mark Spiders had recommended Ty, and Martin in a conversation with Doyle. Hog Molly then broke up and its members other than Doyle formed a band called The Ones. Tad later formed the band Hoof. Tad's current (2008) band Brothers of the Sonic Cloth has been playing in Seattle night clubs. Kurt Danielson went on to form Valis, a project that included members of Screaming Trees and Mudhoney. Then he formed The Quaranteens, a post-punk/new wave band with Craig Paul, before moving to France. He is back in Seattle since 2008, and has started to write a novel. Danielson has also played in other local Seattle-based bands including Misericords (with fellow ex-Tad member Mike Mongrain on drums) and Vaporland (featuring ex members of Love Battery and The Fluid). Josh Sinder has gone on to play drums in The Insurgence and also plays with Marky Felchtone from Zeke in new band Hellbound For Glory. A documentary of the band titled Busted Circuits and Ringing Ears was released in February 2008. In July 2009 taddoyle.com announced plans by Brothers of the Sonic Cloth to release a split 10\\" vinyl record with Seattle-area sludge metal band, Mico de Noche. The Brothers of the Sonic Cloth/Mico de Noche split 10\\" vinyl record was released in October 2009 as an edition of 500 copies and featured two songs by Mico de Noche and one song by Brothers of the Sonic Cloth, \\"Fires Burn Dim in the Shadows of the Mountain\\". The record received several positive reviews and appeared on multiple \\"Best of 2009\\" lists. In 2009 Tad Doyle performed with the members of Soundgarden and Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine at Seattle. Chris Cornell the original vocalist was not present and Doyle took on the vocal duties.

Calpurnius Piso Pontifex from the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum. Lucius Calpurnius Piso (PW 99) (48 BC ‚Äì AD 32) was a prominent Roman senator of the early Empire. His tenure as pontifex led him sometimes to be called Lucius Calpurnius Piso Pontifex, to differentiate him from his contemporary, Lucius Calpurnius Piso the Augur, consul in 1 BC. He was a confidant of the emperors Augustus and Tiberius. ==Biography== He was the son of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, consul in 58 BC, and brother of Calpurnia, the third and last wife of Julius Caesar. Piso was consul in 15 BC, and shortly thereafter engaged in Mediolanum as proconsul.Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus, De Claris Rhetoribus 6. Cassius Dio refers to him as governor of Pamphylia in the years 13 to 11 BC; his province probably included Galatia. In 11 BC, he was sent to Thrace as legatus pro praetore in order to put down a revolt. For his successes there, the senate honoured him with the ornamenta triumphalia.Lucius Cassius Dio Cocceianus, Roman History liv. 34.7.Publius Cornelius Tacitus, Annales, vi. 10. Piso may have also been proconsul of Asia and legate of Syria, but this is disputed. He was praefectus urbi from AD 13 to 32, and a trusted adviser to both Augustus and Tiberius. He was a member of the pontifical college and of the Arval Brethren. He died in 32, and was honoured with a state funeral.Publius Cornelius Tacitus, Annales, vi. 10. Piso's achievements and independence were highly regarded. Horace dedicated his Ars Po√´tica to him (cf. Carmen 2.12), and several epigrams by Antipater of Thessalonica are dedicated to Piso. ==Name== Piso's full nomenclature is somewhat uncertain. Tacitus simply refers to him as Lucius Piso, while the Fasti Albenses call him Lucius Calpurnius Piso.Fasti Albenses, . He is sometimes called Lucius Calpurnius Piso Pontifex, to distinguish him from his contemporary, Lucius Calpurnius Piso Augur, although both Pontifex and Augur are simply nicknames, rather than true cognomina.PW, \\"Calpurnius\\", No. 99. Drumann assigned Piso the agnomen Caesoninus, which had been borne by his ancestors for four generations; but in later editions he is assigned the name Frugi instead.Drumann, Geschichte Roms, vol. II, pp. 65, 66 (2nd edition, 1902). There are two grounds for the latter identification. First, Cassius Dio assigns him the surname Fourtios, which is supposed to be a corruption of Frugi. Secondly, Theodor Mommsen identified his sons, to whom the Ars Po√´tica is addressed, with Lucius Calpurnius Piso and Marcus Licinius Crassus Frugi, consuls in AD 27.Horace, Ars Po√´tica, 366.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 373 (\\"Calpurnius\\", No. 8). However, Klebs doubted this interpretation of Fourtios, and it is not at all certain that the consuls of AD 27 were the sons of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Pontifex. They might instead have been the sons of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, consul in 7 BC.Tacitus, Annales, iii. 16.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, pp. 375, 376 (\\"Calpurnius\\", Nos. 23‚Äì25). In this instance, Marcus Licinius Crassus Frugi would be identified with the Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso whom the senate compelled to change his praenomen. As a result, the question of whether Piso the pontifex was surnamed Caesoninus or Frugi is unresolved. ==See also== * Bierzo Edict * Calpurnia (gens) * Villa of the Papyri * List of Roman consuls ==References== ==Sources== * Seneca, Epistulae 83.14 Category:48 BC births Category:32 deaths Category:1st-century BC Romans Category:1st-century Romans Category:Ancient Roman generals Category:Senators of the Roman Empire Category:Roman governors of Galatia Category:Roman governors of Thracia Category:Roman Republican consuls Category:Urban prefects of Rome Category:Calpurnii Pisones Category:Generals of Augustus ","title":"Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 15 BC)"},{"id":"820919","text":"Spies Like Us is a 1985 American comedy film directed by John Landis and starring Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Steve Forrest, and Donna Dixon. The film presents the comic adventures of two novice intelligence agents sent to the Soviet Union. Originally written by Aykroyd and Dave Thomas to star Aykroyd and John Belushi at Universal, the script went into turnaround and was later picked up by Warner Bros. with Aykroyd and Chase starring. The film is an homage to the famous Road to ‚Ä¶ film series which starred Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. Hope himself makes a cameo in one scene. Other cameos in the film include directors Terry Gilliam, Sam Raimi, Costa-Gavras, Martin Brest, and Joel Coen, musician B.B. King, and visual effects pioneer Ray Harryhausen. ==Plot== Austin Millbarge is a basement-dwelling codebreaker at the Pentagon who aspires to escape his under-respected job to become a secret agent. Emmett Fitz-Hume, a wisecracking, pencil-pushing son of an envoy, takes the foreign service exam under peer pressure. Millbarge and Fitz-Hume meet during the test, on which Fitz-Hume openly attempts to cheat after an attempt to bribe his immediate supervisor in exchange for the answers backfires. Millbarge, however, was forced to take the test, having had only one day to prepare after his supervisor gives him a two-week-old notice leaving him vulnerable to fail and having to stay in the Pentagon trenches. Needing expendable agents to act as decoys to draw attention away from a more capable team, the DIA decides to enlist the two, promote them to be Foreign Service operatives, put them through minimal training, and then send them on an undefined mission into Soviet Central Asia. Meanwhile, professional agents are well on their way to reaching the real objective: the seizure of a mobile SS-50 ICBM launcher. The main team takes a loss, while Millbarge and Fitz-Hume escape enemy attacks and eventually encounter Karen Boyer, the only surviving operative from the main team. In the Pamir Mountains of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, the trio overpowers a mobile missile guard unit using hastily constructed extraterrestrial outfits and tranquilizer guns. Following orders in real-time from the intelligence agency (operating from a military bunker located deep under an abandoned drive-in theater), they begin to operate the launcher. At the end of their instructions, the vehicle launches the ICBM into space, targeting an unspecified area in the United States. Thinking they have started a nuclear war, the American agents and their Soviet counterparts pair up to have sex before the world ends. Meanwhile, the military commander at the operations bunker initiates the conversion of the drive-in theater to expose what is hidden beneath the screens and projection booth: a huge black-op SDI- esque laser and collector/emitter screen. The purpose of sending the agents to launch a Soviet ICBM is exposed as a means to test this anti-ballistic missile system. The laser fails to intercept the nuclear missile, which will almost certainly trigger a global thermonuclear war. One of the military commanders at the site then reveals an elaborate plan to \\"preserve the American way of life\\". The covert operations conducted throughout the film are now assumed to be a plot by high-ranking military officials to orchestrate a war. Back in the Soviet Union, horrified at the thought of having launched a nuclear missile at their own country, the American spies and the Soviet soldiers use Millbarge's technical knowledge to transmit instructions to the traveling missile, sending it off into space where it detonates harmlessly. Immediately after, the underground bunker is stormed by U.S. Army Rangers, and the intelligence and military officials involved in the covert operation are arrested. Millbarge, Fitz-Hume, and Boyer go on to become nuclear disarmament negotiators, playing a nuclear version of Risk-meets-Trivial Pursuit against the Soviets. ==Cast== ==Title song== The title song, \\"Spies Like Us\\", was written and performed by Paul McCartney. It reached #7 on the singles chart in the United States in early 1986. It also reached #13 in the UK. John Landis directed a music video for the song where Aykroyd and Chase can be seen performing the song with McCartney (although they didn't actually play on the record). ==Soundtrack== The film's score was composed by Elmer Bernstein and performed by the Graunke Symphony Orchestra, conducted by the composer. The soundtrack album was released by Var√®se Sarabande; it does not contain the Paul McCartney song. The film also featured \\"Soul Finger,\\" by the Bar-Kays, also absent from the soundtrack. Fitz-Hume watches Ronald Reagan singing \\"I'll Be Loving You\\" from the musical She's Working Her Way Through College early in the film. # The Ace Tomato Company (5:06) # Off To Spy (1:52) # Russians In The Desert (2:21) # Pass In The Tent (2:58) # Escape (3:25) # To The Bus (3:14) # The Road To Russia (3:39) # Rally 'Round (2:39) # W.A.M.P.

The film grossed $17.2 million overseas for a worldwide gross of $77.3 million. ===Critical reception=== The Washington Post critic Paul Attanasio called Spies Like Us \\"a comedy with exactly one laugh, and those among you given to Easter egg hunts may feel free to try and find it.\\" The Chicago Reader critic Dave Kehr criticized the film's character development, saying that \\"Landis never bothers to account for the friendship that springs up spontaneously between these two antipathetic types, but then he never bothers to account for anything in this loose progression of recycled Abbott and Costello riffs.\\" The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote, \\"The stars are always affable, and they're worth watching even when they do very little, but it's painful to sit by as the screenplay runs out of steam.\\" Variety magazine opined in a staff review, \\"Spies is not very amusing. Though Chase and Aykroyd provide moments, the overall script thinly takes on eccentric espionage and nuclear madness, with nothing new to add.\\" TV Guide published a staff review which stated, \\"Landis' direction is indulgent, to say the least, with big landscapes, big crashes, big hardware, and big gags filling the screen. What he forgets is character development, that all-important factor that must exist for comedy to work well.\\" David Parkinson, writing for the Radio Times, felt that \\"Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase simply fail to gel, and there's little fun to be had once the boisterous training school gags are exhausted.\\" Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 32%, based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 4.38/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Despite the comedic prowess of its director and two leads, Spies Like Us appears to disavow all knowledge of how to make the viewer laugh.\\" Metacritic gives the film a score of 22 out of 100, based on 9 critics, which indicates \\"Generally unfavorable reviews\\". Writing for Common Sense Media, Andrea Beach called the film a \\"dated '80s comedy [with] strong language, few laughs.\\" Collider staff writer Jeff Giles, reviewing the film's Blu-ray Disc release, stated, \\"on the whole, it‚Äôs more amusing than funny; it‚Äôs only 102 minutes, but it feels too long by half. For all the talent involved, there‚Äôs an awful lot of flab. It‚Äôs the kind of movie you can walk away from for 10 minutes without missing anything important.\\" ==Legacy== The animated comedy series Family Guy paid tribute to the film with its 2009 episode \\"Spies Reminiscent of Us\\", which guest starred Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase as fictionalized versions of themselves who, according to the series, were made real spies by Ronald Reagan after he saw the film Spies Like Us. The episode recreates numerous scenes from the film. The live-action spy comedy series Chuck was heavily influenced by Spies, including references to \\"GLG-20\\" and the introduction of character Emmett Millbarge (Tony Hale), combined from the names of the Spies protagonists. == References * Category:1985 films Category:1980s action comedy films Category:1980s buddy comedy films Category:American films Category:American action comedy films Category:American buddy comedy films Category:American spy comedy films Category:Cold War spy films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Elmer Bernstein Category:Films directed by John Landis Category:Films produced by Brian Grazer Category:Films set in the Soviet Union Category:Films set in Afghanistan Category:Films set in Tajikistan Category:1980s spy comedy films Category:Warner Bros. films Category:Films with screenplays by Dan Aykroyd Category:Films with screenplays by Lowell Ganz Category:Films with screenplays by Babaloo Mandel Category:Cold War in popular culture Category:Film about the Third World War Category:Films produced by George Folsey Jr. Category:Films about nuclear war and weapons Category:1985 comedy films ","title":"Spies Like Us"},{"id":"820943","text":"La Bombonera most commonly refers to Estadio Alberto J.

Impairment can be of single or multiple nutrients depending on the abnormality. This may lead to malnutrition and a variety of anaemias. Normally the human gastrointestinal tract digests and absorbs dietary nutrients with remarkable efficiency. A typical Western diet ingested by an adult in one day includes approximately 100 g of fat, 400 g of carbohydrate, 100 g of protein, 2 L of fluid, and the required sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, vitamins, and other elements. Salivary, gastric, intestinal, hepatic, and pancreatic secretions add an additional 7‚Äì8 L of protein-, lipid-, and electrolyte-containing fluid to intestinal contents. This massive load is reduced by the small and large intestines to less than 200 g of stool that contains less than 8 g of fat, 1‚Äì2 g of nitrogen, and less than 20 mmol each of Na+, K+, Cl‚Äì, HCO3‚Äì, Ca2+, or Mg2+. If there is impairment of any of the many steps involved in the complex process of nutrient digestion and absorption, intestinal malabsorption may ensue. If the abnormality involves a single step in the absorptive process, as in primary lactase deficiency, or if the disease process is limited to the very proximal small intestine, then selective malabsorption of only a single nutrient may occur. However, generalized malabsorption of multiple dietary nutrients develops when the disease process is extensive, thus disturbing several digestive and absorptive processes, as occurs in coeliac disease with extensive involvement of the small intestine. ==Signs and symptomsGastrointestinal manifestations=== Depending on the nature of the disease process causing malabsorption and its extent, gastrointestinal symptoms may range from severe to subtle or may even be totally absent. Diarrhea, weight loss, flatulence, abdominal bloating, abdominal cramps, and pain may be present. Although diarrhea is a common complaint, the character and frequency of stools may vary considerably ranging from over 10 watery stools per day to less than one voluminous putty-like stool, the latter causing some patients to complain of constipation. On the other hand, stool mass is invariably increased in patients with steatorrhea and generalized malabsorption above the normal with 150‚Äì200 g/day. Not only do unabsorbed nutrients contribute to stool mass but mucosal fluid and electrolyte secretion is also increased in diseases associated with mucosal inflammation such as coeliac disease. In addition, unabsorbed fatty acids, converted to hydroxy-fatty acids by colonic flora, as well as unabsorbed bile acids both impair absorption and induce secretion of water and electrolytes by the colon adding to stool mass. Weight loss is common among patients with significant intestinal malabsorption but must be evaluated in the context of caloric intake. Some patients compensate for fecal wastage of unabsorbed nutrients by significantly increasing their oral intake. Eliciting a careful dietary history from patients with suspected malabsorption is therefore crucial. Excessive flatus and abdominal bloating may reflect excessive gas production due to fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrate, especially among patients with a primary or secondary disaccharidase deficiency, such as lactose intolerance or sucrose intolerance. Malabsorption of dietary nutrients and excessive fluid secretion by inflamed small intestine also contribute to abdominal distention and bloating. Prevalence, severity, and character of abdominal pain vary considerably among the various disease processes associated with intestinal malabsorption. For example, pain is common in patients with chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer and Crohn's disease, but it is absent in many patients with coeliac disease or postgastrectomy malabsorption. ===Extraintestinal manifestations=== Substantial numbers of patients with intestinal malabsorption present initially with symptoms or laboratory abnormalities that point to other organ systems in the absence of or overshadowing symptoms referable to the gastrointestinal tract. For example, there is increasing epidemiologic evidence that more patients with coeliac disease present with anemia and osteopenia in the absence of significant classic gastrointestinal symptoms. Microcytic, macrocytic, or dimorphic anemia may reflect impaired iron, folate, or vitamin B12 absorption. Purpura, subconjunctival hemorrhage, or even frank bleeding may reflect hypoprothrombinemia secondary to vitamin K malabsorption. Osteopenia is common, especially in the presence of steatorrhea. Impaired calcium and vitamin D absorption and chelation of calcium by unabsorbed fatty acids resulting in fecal loss of calcium may all contribute. If calcium deficiency is prolonged, secondary hyperparathyroidism may develop. Prolonged malnutrition may induce amenorrhea, infertility, and impotence. Edema and even ascites may reflect hypoproteinemia associated with protein losing enteropathy caused by lymphatic obstruction or extensive mucosal inflammation. Dermatitis and peripheral neuropathy may be caused by malabsorption of specific vitamins or micronutrients and essential fatty acids. ===Presentation=== Small intestine : major site of absorption Symptoms can manifest in a variety of ways and features might give a clue to the underlying condition. Symptoms can be intestinal or extra-intestinal - the former predominates in severe malabsorption. * Diarrhoea, often steatorrhoea, is the most common feature. Watery, diurnal and nocturnal, bulky, frequent stools are the clinical hallmark of overt malabsorption. It is due to impaired water, carbohydrate and electrolyte absorption or irritation from unabsorbed fatty acid. The latter also results in bloating, flatulence and abdominal discomfort. Cramping pain usually suggests obstructive intestinal segment e.g. in Crohn's disease, especially if it persists after defecation. * Weight loss can be significant despite increased oral intake of nutrients.health a to z * Growth retardation, failure to thrive, delayed puberty in children * Swelling or oedema from loss of protein * Anaemias, commonly from vitamin B12, folic acid and iron deficiency presenting as fatigue and weakness. * Muscle cramp from decreased vitamin D, calcium absorption. Also lead to osteomalacia and osteoporosis * Bleeding tendencies from vitamin K and other coagulation factor deficiencies. ==Causes== { - Due to infective agents * HIV related malabsorption * Intestinal tuberculosis * Parasites e.g., diphyllobothrium (fish tape worm) (B12 malabsorption), giardiasis (Giardia lamblia), hookworm (Ancylostoma duodenale roundworm, and Necator americanus) * Traveler's diarrhea * Tropical sprue * Whipple's disease - Due to structural defects * Blind loops * Fistulae, diverticula and strictures * Infiltrative conditions such as amyloidosis, lymphoma, eosinophilic gastroenteritis * Inflammatory bowel diseases, as in Crohn's disease * Radiation enteritis * Short bowel syndrome * Systemic sclerosis and collagen vascular diseases - Due to surgical structural changes * Bariatric surgery (Weight loss surgery) * Gastrectomy; Vagotomy - Due to mucosal abnormality * Coeliac disease * Cows' milk intolerance * Fructose malabsorption * Soya milk intolerance - Due to enzyme deficiencies * Lactase deficiency inducing lactose intolerance (constitutional, secondary or rarely congenital) * Intestinal disaccharidase deficiency * Intestinal enteropeptidase deficiency * Sucrose intolerance - Due to digestive failure * Bile acid/Bile salt malabsorption ** Bacterial overgrowth ** Obstructive jaundice ** Primary bile acid diarrhea ** Terminal ileal disease such as Crohn's disease * Pancreatic insufficiencies: ** Carcinoma of pancreas ** Chronic pancreatitis ** Cystic fibrosis * Zollinger- Ellison syndrome - Due to other systemic diseases affecting GI tract * Abetalipoproteinaemia * Addison's disease * Carcinoid syndrome * Coeliac disease * Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) * Fiber Deficiency * Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism * Diabetes mellitus * Hyperparathyroidism and Hypoparathyroidism * Malnutrition - Other Possible Causes * Chronic Proton Pump Inhibitor Use } ==Pathophysiology== The main purpose of the gastrointestinal tract is to digest and absorb nutrients (fat, carbohydrate, protein, micronutrients (vitamins and trace minerals), water, and electrolytes. Digestion involves both mechanical and enzymatic breakdown of food. Mechanical processes include chewing, gastric churning, and the to-and- fro mixing in the small intestine. Enzymatic hydrolysis is initiated by intraluminal processes requiring gastric, pancreatic, and biliary secretions. The final products of digestion are absorbed through the intestinal epithelial cells. Malabsorption constitutes the pathological interference with the normal physiological sequence of digestion (intraluminal process), absorption (mucosal process) and transport (postmucosal events) of nutrients. Intestinal malabsorption can be due to: * Congenital or acquired reduction in absorptive surface * Defects of ion transport * Defects of specific hydrolysis * Impaired enterohepatic circulation * Mucosal damage (enteropathy) * Pancreatic insufficiency ==Diagnosis== There is no single, specific test for malabsorption. As for most medical conditions, investigation is guided by symptoms and signs. A range of different conditions can produce malabsorption and it is necessary to look for each of these specifically. Many tests have been advocated, and some, such as tests for pancreatic function are complex, vary between centers and have not been widely adopted. However, better tests have become available with greater ease of use, better sensitivity and specificity for the causative conditions. Tests are also needed to detect the systemic effects of deficiency of the malabsorbed nutrients (such as anaemia with vitamin B12 malabsorption). ===Classification=== Some prefer to classify malabsorption clinically into three basic categories:Gasbarrini G, Frisono M: Critical evaluation of malabsorption tests; in # selective, as seen in lactose malabsorption. # partial, as observed in abetalipoproteinaemia. # total, as in exceptional cases of coeliac disease. ===Blood tests=== * Routine blood tests may reveal anaemia, high CRP or low albumin; which shows a high correlation for the presence of an organic disease. In this setting, microcytic anaemia usually implies iron deficiency and macrocytosis can be caused by impaired folic acid or B12 absorption or both. Low cholesterol or triglyceride may give a clue toward fat malabsorption. Low calcium and phosphate may give a clue toward osteomalacia from low vitamin D. * Specific vitamins like vitamin D or micro nutrient like zinc levels can be checked. Fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) are affected in fat malabsorption. Prolonged prothrombin time can be caused by vitamin K deficiency. * Serological studies. Specific tests are carried out to determine the underlying cause. :IgA Anti- transglutaminase antibodies or IgA Anti-endomysial antibodies for Coeliac disease (gluten sensitive enteropathy). ===Stool studies=== * Microscopy is particularly useful in diarrhoea, may show protozoa like Giardia, ova, cyst and other infective agents. * Fecal fat study to diagnose steatorrhoea is rarely performed nowadays. * Low fecal pancreatic elastase is indicative of pancreatic insufficiency. Chymotrypsin and pancreolauryl can be assessed as well ===Radiological studies=== * Barium follow through is useful in delineating small intestinal anatomy. Barium enema may be undertaken to see colonic or ileal lesions. * CT abdomen is useful in ruling out structural abnormality, done in pancreatic protocol when visualising pancreas. * Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) to complement or as an alternative to ERCP. ===Interventional studies=== Biopsy of small bowel showing coeliac disease manifested by blunting of villi, crypt hyperplasia, and lymphocyte infiltration of crypts. * OGD to detect duodenal pathology and obtain D2 biopsy (for coeliac disease, tropical sprue, Whipple's disease, abetalipoproteinaemia etc.) * Enteroscopy for enteropathy and jejunal aspirate and culture for bacterial overgrowth * Capsule Endoscopy is able to visualise the whole small intestine and is occasionally useful. * Colonoscopy is necessary in colonic and ileal disease. * ERCP will show pancreatic and biliary structural abnormalities. ===Other investigations=== * 75SeHCAT test to diagnose bile acid malabsorption in ileal disease or primary bile acid diarrhea. * Glucose hydrogen breath test for bacterial overgrowth * Lactose hydrogen breath test for lactose intolerance * Sugar probes or 51Cr-EDTA to determine intestinal permeability. ===Obsolete tests no longer used clinically=== * D-xylose absorption test for mucosal disease or bacterial overgrowth. Normal in pancreatic insufficiency. * Bile salt breath test (14C-glycocholate) to determine bile salt malabsorption. * Schilling test to establish cause of B12 deficiency. ==Management== Treatment is directed largely towards management of underlying cause: * Replacement of nutrients, electrolytes and fluid may be necessary. In severe deficiency, hospital admission may be required for nutritional support and detailed advice from dietitians. Use of enteral nutrition by naso-gastric or other feeding tubes may be able to provide sufficient nutritional supplementation. Tube placement may also be done by percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, or surgical jejunostomy. In patients whose intestinal absorptive surface is severely limited from disease or surgery, long term total parenteral nutrition may be needed. * Pancreatic enzymes are supplemented orally in pancreatic insufficiency. * Dietary modification is important in some conditions: ** Gluten-free diet in coeliac disease. ** Lactose avoidance in lactose intolerance. * Antibiotic therapy to treat Small Bowel Bacterial overgrowth. * Cholestyramine or other bile acid sequestrants will help reducing diarrhoea in bile acid malabsorption. ==See also== * Fructose malabsorption * Protein losing enteropathy ==References== == External links == Category:Gastrointestinal tract disorders Category:Steatorrhea-related diseases Category:Diarrhea ","title":"Malabsorption"},{"id":"820979","text":"Isabella II, her husband Francis, King Consort of Spain (left), and Infante Francisco de Paula (right) with the most important Spanish statesmen and army officers of the time, many of whom were Grandees of Spain, by Charles Porion, 1862 Grandee (; , ; , ) is an official aristocratic title conferred on some Spanish nobility and Portuguese nobility. Holders of this dignity enjoyed similar privileges to those of the peerage of France during the , though in neither country did they have the significant constitutional political role the House of Lords gave to the Peerage of England and later Peerage of the United Kingdom. A \\"Grandee of Spain\\" would have typically enjoyed greater privileges than those of other similar European dignities, such as the peers of France or the peers of Great Britain.[Santa Cruz y Mallen, Francisco Javier: Origen y transformaci√≥n de la Grandeza de Espa√±a (1946).] All Spanish dukedoms are automatically attached to a Grandeeship yet only a few Marquessates, Countships, Viscountcies, Baronies and Lordships have the distinction. A single person can be a Grandee of Spain multiple times, as Grandeeships are attached, with the exception of a few cases, to a title and not an individual. Consequently, nobles in Spain with more than one title, most notably the Duchess of Medinaceli and the Duke of Alba, are Grandees 10 and 9 times respectively. As of 2018, Grandeeships totalled 417 out of the 2,942 extant titles in Spain (approximately 14%) of which there were 153 Dukedoms, 142 Marquessates, 108 Countships, 2 Viscountcies, 2 Baronies, 3 Lordships and 7 hereditary yet non title-attached Grandees. If one inputs the value in the GRANDEZA section of the title guide, it will return 417 results. If one further inputs , , , and it will return 142, 108, 2, 2 and 3 respectively. Furthermore, if one inputs in the TITLE section, it will return 7 results, that is, the 7 Grandees not attached to titles. Despite losing their last legal privilege in 1984, when the right to possess diplomatic passports and immunity were revoked for all Grandees of Spain, they still enjoy certain ceremonial privileges. All Grandees are entitled to remain covered in the presence of the King of Spain, as well as being addressed by him as (cousin), a privilege that originated in the 16th century, when most Grandees were close relatives of the Monarch. In addition, the term can refer to other people of a somewhat comparable, exalted position, roughly synonymous with magnate; formerly a rank of high nobility (especially when it carried the right to a parliamentary seat). By extension, the term can refer informally to any important person of high status, particularly wealthy, landed long-time residents in a region. In the United Kingdom the term is currently and informally used of influential and long-standing members of the Conservative Party, Labour Party and Liberal Democrats, and has had more specific meanings in the past. == Spain == Coronet of a Grandee of Spain Most Spanish noble titles are granted as (Peer of the realm), many of which predate the modern Spanish monarchy. The Kings of Spain re-established in 1520 the ancient dignity of to confer as an additional rank of honour. The Post-nominals of Grandees of Spain is . The dignity of Grandee () began to be assumed by Spain's leading noblemen in the Middle Ages to distinguish them as a ('Lord of the realm'), from lesser (), whose rank evolved into that of . It was, as John Selden the 17th-century English jurist pointed out, not a general term denoting a class, but \\"an additional individual dignity not only to all Dukes but to some Marquesses and Counts also\\".Titles of Honor, ed. 1672, p. 478 Noble titles, including and above the rank of Count, were seldom created in heredity by the Kings of Castile and Aragon until the late Middle Ages‚Äîin contrast to France and elsewhere in Europe (where feudalism evolved more quickly)‚Äîbeing largely associated with royal officers until the 14th century. The conferral of grandeeships initially conveyed only ceremonial privileges, such as remaining covered or seated in the presence of royalty. Over time grandees received more substantial rights: for example freedom from taxation and immunity from arrest, save at the King's command; they were usually the senior judicial officers of their region. These rights later became open to abuse with some Grandees renouncing their allegiance to the monarchy to wage war on the King. In the late 1470s, King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I were the first to clamp down on grandee powers assumed by the medieval territorial nobles. In the 16th century, limitations on the number of grandees were introduced by King Charles I (who later became Holy Roman Emperor as Charles V), who decreed that the Spanish Crown had the sole right to confer the dignity of a grandee. Subsequently, the (Grandees of Spain) were subdivided into three grades: # those who spoke to the King and received his reply in full regalia; # those who addressed the King uncovered, but by right wore their coronets to hear his answer; # those who required permission from the King before wearing their coronets. Heraldic mantle of a Grandee of Spain All grandees traditionally have been addressed by the king as mi Primo (my cousin), whereas ordinary nobles are formally styled as mi Pariente (my kinsman). Grandezas could also be bestowed upon foreigners, such as the memorialist Louis de Rouvroy, Duc de Saint-Simon who took great pride in becoming a grandee after his successful posting as French Ambassador to Madrid, representing King Louis XIV. The dignity of grandee was abolished by the Napoleonic King Joseph Bonaparte, before being revived in 1834 by when grandees were given precedence in the Chamber of Peers of Spain. Nowadays, all grandees are deemed to be \\"of the first class\\", and is an honorific dignity conferring neither power or legal privilege. A (grandeeship) is a separate legal entity from a title of nobility, although are normally but not exclusively granted in conjunction with a title. Since the 20th century invariably the King of Spain has conferred a upon any newly created duke. A grandee of any noble rank is higher in precedence than a non-grandee (apart from members of the Spanish Royal Family), even if that non-grandee holds a hereditary title () of a higher grade than that of the said grandee. Thus, a baron-grandee would outrank a non-grandee marquess, thus rendering the dignity of an hereditary rank of precedence rather than a title of nobility. Since 1987, children of an of Spain are recognised as members of the Spanish royal family and are accorded the rank and style of a grandee by courtesy: they do not formally hold this dignity until such time as a title with is granted to them by the sovereign. Some of the best known Spanish grandees are the Dukes of Arcos, Dukes of Alba, of Medinaceli, of Villahermosa, of Osuna, , of Alburquerque, of Moctezuma, of N√°jera, of Fr√≠as and of Medina-Sidonia; well- known Marquesses include those of Aguilar de Campoo, of Astorga, of Santillana, and of ; the Counts of Benavente, Ler√≠n, Olivares, O√±ate, and Lemos also hold grandeeships. Grandees and their consorts are entitled to the honorific prefix of 'the Most Excellent Lord/Lady' or 'His/Her Most Excellency', and they are addressed as (cousin) by the King. ==Portugal and Brazil== Both Portuguese and Brazilian nobility formerly used the term (\\"grandee\\"), to designate a higher rank of noblemen. The Brazilian system, for instance, automatically deemed dukes, marquises and counts (as well as archbishops and bishops) (\\"Grandees of the Empire\\", or literally translated as \\"Great Ones of the Empire\\"). Viscounts and barons could also be ennobled with or without (\\"grandeeship\\", alternatively \\"greatness\\"). Viscounts ennobled with grandeeship displayed a Count's coronet on their coat of arms, and Barons ennobled with grandeeship bore a coat of arms surmounted by a Viscount's coronet. The order of precedence in Brazilian nobility was as follows: after the members of the Imperial Family, dukes, marquises, counts, viscounts with grandeeship, viscounts without grandeeship, barons with grandeeship, barons without grandeeship. Brazilian grandeeships, like its nobility, were not hereditary titles. Grandees were allowed to keep their heads covered in the presence of the king or emperor until such time as the monarch may command otherwise; as elsewhere throughout Europe, these noble families displayed their coats of arms on their properties, carriages (or vehicles), and over their graves (see hatchment). The abolition of the monarchies in Portugal and Brazil extinguished the formal use of such titles, although their use continues among some of the Portuguese aristocracies. ==Grandee (New Model Army)== During the English Civil War, senior military officers from the landed gentry serving in the New Model Army, opposing the Levellers, came to be informally termed Grandees.The OED first cites this specific usage as \\"1648‚Äì9 C. WALKER Relat. & Observ. 1 The said Leading men or Grandees (for that is now Parliament language) First divided themselves into two factions.\\" After the defeat of King Charles I in the civil war, there was a series of debates and confrontations between the radical elected representatives of the New Model Army soldiers, known as Agitators, and the Army Grandees such as Sir Thomas Fairfax, Oliver Cromwell, and Henry Ireton, who opposed the Agitators' more radical proposals. The disagreements were aired publicly at the Putney Debates, which started in late October 1647 and lasted for several weeks.David Plant The Levellers on the website of the British Civil Wars and Commonwealth ==See also== * List of current Grandees of Spain * Hidalgo (nobility) * * ==References== Category:Levellers Category:New Model Army ","title":"Grandee"},{"id":"821005","text":"The pale-breasted spinetail (Synallaxis albescens), is a passerine bird which breeds in the tropical New World from Costa Rica to Uruguay, and in Trinidad.

One is the wife of Ham, son of Noah, who bears his children. The other is their daughter, who discovered Egypt while \\"it was under water\\" (1:23-24). The younger Egyptus places her eldest son on the throne as Pharaoh, the first king of Egypt (1:25). Pharaoh was a descendant of the Canaanites (1:22), a race of people who had been cursed with black skin (Moses 7:8). A minority of some early Mormon leaders have taught that Egyptus passed black skin and the curse of Cain through the flood so that the devil might have representation upon the earth, although this has now been repudiated by later leaders. The word Egyptus is considered to be an anachronism in the Book of Abraham among non- Mormon Egyptologists and historians,Stephen E.

The word \\"pharaoh\\" is also considered to be an anachronism in the Book of Abraham for similar reasons. ==The Curse of Cain== W. W. Phelps, a counselor in the presidency of the church, was the first in the church to teach that Ham's wife was black because she was under the curse of Cain. In 1835, he taught that Ham himself was cursed because he had married a black wife. Brigham Young also taught that Egyptus was under the curse of Cain and passed the curse through the flood. John Taylor explained that it was necessary that the curse of Cain was passed through Egyptus so that \\"the devil should have a representation upon the earth as well as God\\".

Budge, Book of the Dead, 490 and in Bibliotheca (2.1.4-5), as the eponymous son of Belus & Anchinoe, who first conquers Egypt. The etymological source of the name of Egypt is important since three 1835 prepublication manuscripts of the LDS Book of Abraham read Zeptah instead of Egyptus as the name of the elder Egyptus (1:25).Hauglid, A Textual History of the Book of Abraham; Whipple, master's thesis.http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/warren-parrish-copy-of- abraham-manuscript- fall-1835-abraham-14-22?p=4http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/william- w-phelps-and-warren-parrish-copy-of-abraham-manuscript-summer- fall-1835-abraham-11-218?p=5 This variant name could very well reflect the Egyptian name S–ót-Pt·∏•, \\"Daughter-of-Ptah\\" (the -t- in S–ót is silent) which is known from the Middle Kingdom into the late period.Ranke, Die √§gyptischen Personennamen I.288.22); cf.

Like any cognitive architecture, ACT-R aims to define the basic and irreducible cognitive and perceptual operations that enable the human mind. In theory, each task that humans can perform should consist of a series of these discrete operations. Most of the ACT-R's basic assumptions are also inspired by the progress of cognitive neuroscience, and ACT-R can be seen and described as a way of specifying how the brain itself is organized in a way that enables individual processing modules to produce cognition. ==Inspiration== ACT-R has been inspired by the work of Allen Newell, and especially by his lifelong championing the idea of unified theories as the only way to truly uncover the underpinnings of cognition. In fact, John Anderson usually credits Allen Newell as the major source of influence over his own theory. ==What ACT-R looks like== Like other influential cognitive architectures (including Soar, CLARION, and EPIC), the ACT-R theory has a computational implementation as an interpreter of a special coding language. The interpreter itself is written in Common Lisp, and might be loaded into any of the Common Lisp language distributions. This means that any researcher may download the ACT-R code from the ACT-R website, load it into a Common Lisp distribution, and gain full access to the theory in the form of the ACT-R interpreter. Also, this enables researchers to specify models of human cognition in the form of a script in the ACT-R language. The language primitives and data-types are designed to reflect the theoretical assumptions about human cognition. These assumptions are based on numerous facts derived from experiments in cognitive psychology and brain imaging. Like a programming language, ACT-R is a framework: for different tasks (e.g., Tower of Hanoi, memory for text or for list of words, language comprehension, communication, aircraft controlling), researchers create \\"models\\" (i.e., programs) in ACT-R. These models reflect the modelers' assumptions about the task within the ACT-R view of cognition. The model might then be run. Running a model automatically produces a step-by-step simulation of human behavior which specifies each individual cognitive operation (i.e., memory encoding and retrieval, visual and auditory encoding, motor programming and execution, mental imagery manipulation). Each step is associated with quantitative predictions of latencies and accuracies. The model can be tested by comparing its results with the data collected in behavioral experiments. In recent years, ACT-R has also been extended to make quantitative predictions of patterns of activation in the brain, as detected in experiments with fMRI. In particular, ACT-R has been augmented to predict the shape and time-course of the BOLD response of several brain areas, including the hand and mouth areas in the motor cortex, the left prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the basal ganglia. ===Brief outline=== ACT-R's most important assumption is that human knowledge can be divided into two irreducible kinds of representations: declarative and procedural. Within the ACT-R code, declarative knowledge is represented in the form of chunks, i.e. vector representations of individual properties, each of them accessible from a labelled slot. Chunks are held and made accessible through buffers, which are the front-end of what are modules, i.e. specialized and largely independent brain structures. There are two types of modules: * Perceptual-motor modules, which take care of the interface with the real world (i.e., with a simulation of the real world). The most well-developed perceptual-motor modules in ACT-R are the visual and the manual modules. * Memory modules. There are two kinds of memory modules in ACT-R: ** Declarative memory, consisting of facts such as Washington, D.C. is the capital of United States, France is a country in Europe, or 2+3=5 ** Procedural memory, made of productions. Productions represent knowledge about how we do things: for instance, knowledge about how to type the letter \\"Q\\" on a keyboard, about how to drive, or about how to perform addition. All the modules can only be accessed through their buffers. The contents of the buffers at a given moment in time represents the state of ACT-R at that moment. The only exception to this rule is the procedural module, which stores and applies procedural knowledge. It does not have an accessible buffer and is actually used to access other module's contents. Procedural knowledge is represented in form of productions. The term \\"production\\" reflects the actual implementation of ACT-R as a production system, but, in fact, a production is mainly a formal notation to specify the information flow from cortical areas (i.e. the buffers) to the basal ganglia, and back to the cortex. At each moment, an internal pattern matcher searches for a production that matches the current state of the buffers. Only one such production can be executed at a given moment. That production, when executed, can modify the buffers and thus change the state of the system. Thus, in ACT-R, cognition unfolds as a succession of production firings. ===The symbolic vs. connectionist debate=== In the cognitive sciences, different theories are usually ascribed to either the \\"symbolic\\" or the \\"connectionist\\" approach to cognition. ACT-R clearly belongs to the \\"symbolic\\" field and is classified as such in standard textbooks and collections. Its entities (chunks and productions) are discrete and its operations are syntactical, that is, not referring to the semantic content of the representations but only to their properties that deem them appropriate to participate in the computation(s). This is seen clearly in the chunk slots and in the properties of buffer matching in productions, both of which function as standard symbolic variables. Members of the ACT-R community, including its developers, prefer to think of ACT-R as a general framework that specifies how the brain is organized, and how its organization gives birth to what is perceived (and, in cognitive psychology, investigated) as mind, going beyond the traditional symbolic/connectionist debate. None of this, naturally, argues against the classification of ACT-R as symbolic system, because all symbolic approaches to cognition aim to describe the mind, as a product of brain function, using a certain class of entities and systems to achieve that goal. A common misunderstanding suggests that ACT-R may not be a symbolic system because it attempts to characterize brain function. This is incorrect on two counts: First, all approaches to computational modeling of cognition, symbolic or otherwise, must in some respect characterize brain function, because the mind is brain function. And second, all such approaches, including connectionist approaches, attempt to characterize the mind at a cognitive level of description and not at the neural level, because it is only at the cognitive level at which important generalizations can be retained.Pylyshyn, Z. W. (1984). Computation and Cognition: Toward a Foundation for Cognitive Science. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. . Further misunderstandings arise because of the associative character of certain ACT-R properties, such as chunks spreading activation to each other, or chunks and productions carrying quantitative properties relevant to their selection. None of these properties counter the fundamental nature of these entities as symbolic, regardless of their role in unit selection and, ultimately, in computation. ===Theory vs. implementation, and Vanilla ACT-R=== The importance of distinguishing between the theory itself and its implementation is usually highlighted by ACT-R developers. In fact, much of the implementation does not reflect the theory. For instance, the actual implementation makes use of additional 'modules' that exist only for purely computational reasons, and are not supposed to reflect anything in the brain (e.g., one computational module contains the pseudo- random number generator used to produce noisy parameters, while another holds naming routines for generating data structures accessible through variable names). Also, the actual implementation is designed to enable researchers to modify the theory, e.g. by altering the standard parameters, or creating new modules, or partially modifying the behavior of the existing ones. Finally, while Anderson's laboratory at CMU maintains and releases the official ACT-R code, other alternative implementations of the theory have been made available. These alternative implementations include jACT-R Harrison, A. (2002). jACT-R: Java ACT-R. Proceedings of the 8th Annual ACT-R Workshop PDF (written in Java by Anthony M. Harrison at the Naval Research Laboratory) and Python ACT-R (written in Python by Terrence C. Stewart and Robert L. West at Carleton University, Canada).Stewart, T. C. and West, R. L. (2006) Deconstructing ACT-R. Proceedings of the seventh international conference on cognitive modeling PDF Similarly, ACT-RN (now discontinued) was a full-fledged neural implementation of the 1993 version of the theory.Lebiere, C., & Anderson, J. R. (1993). A connectionist Implementation of the ACT-R production system. In Proceedings of the Fifteenth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 635‚Äì640). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates All of these versions were fully functional, and models have been written and run with all of them. Because of these implementational degrees of freedom, the ACT-R community usually refers to the \\"official\\", Lisp-based, version of the theory, when adopted in its original form and left unmodified, as \\"Vanilla ACT-R\\". ==Applications== Over the years, ACT-R models have been used in more than 700 different scientific publications, and have been cited in many more. ===Memory, attention, and executive control=== The ACT-R declarative memory system has been used to model human memory since its inception. In the course of years, it has been adopted to successfully model a large number of known effects. They include the fan effect of interference for associated information,Anderson, J. R. & Reder, L. M. (1999). The fan effect: New results and new theories. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 128, 186‚Äì197. primacy and recency effects for list memory,Anderson, J.

A production system theory of serial memory. Psychological Review, 104, 728‚Äì748. ACT-R has been used to model attentive and control processes in a number of cognitive paradigms. These include the Stroop task,Lovett, M. C. (2005) A strategy-based interpretation of Stroop. Cognitive Science, 29, 493‚Äì524.Juvina, I., & Taatgen, N. A. (2009).

Threaded cognition: An integrated theory of concurrent multitasking. Psychological Review', 130(1)', 101‚Äì130. ===Natural language=== A number of researchers have been using ACT-R to model several aspects of natural language understanding and production. They include models of syntactic parsing,Lewis, R. L. & Vasishth, S. (2005). An activation-based model of sentence processing as skilled memory retrieval. Cognitive Science, 29, 375‚Äì419 language understanding,Budiu, R. & Anderson, J. R. (2004). Interpretation-Based Processing: A Unified Theory of Semantic Sentence Processing.

Memory & Cognition, 30, 158‚Äì165. ===Complex tasks=== ACT-R has been used to capture how humans solve complex problems like the Tower of Hanoi,Altmann, E. M. & Trafton, J. G. (2002). Memory for goals: An activation-based model. Cognitive Science, 26, 39‚Äì83. or how people solve algebraic equations.Anderson, J. R. (2005) Human symbol manipulation within an integrated cognitive architecture. Cognitive Science, 29(3), 313‚Äì341. It has also been used to model human behavior in driving and flying.Byrne, M. D., & Kirlik, A. (2005). Using computational cognitive modeling to diagnose possible sources of aviation error. International Journal of Aviation Psychology, 15, 135‚Äì155. With the integration of perceptual-motor capabilities, ACT-R has become increasingly popular as a modeling tool in human factors and human-computer interaction. In this domain, it has been adopted to model driving behavior under different conditions,Salvucci, D. D. (2006). Modeling driver behavior in a cognitive architecture.

(2002) Modeling icon search in ACT-R/PM. Cognitive Systems Research, 3, 25‚Äì33. and web navigation. ===Cognitive neuroscience=== More recently, ACT-R has been used to predict patterns of brain activation during imaging experiments.Anderson, J.R., Fincham, J. M., Qin, Y., & Stocco, A. (2008). A central circuit of the mind. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 12(4), 136‚Äì143 In this field, ACT-R models have been successfully used to predict prefrontal and parietal activity in memory retrieval,Sohn, M.-H., Goode, A., Stenger, V. A, Carter, C. S., & Anderson, J. R. (2003). Competition and representation during memory retrieval: Roles of the prefrontal cortex and the posterior parietal cortex, Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences, 100, 7412‚Äì7417. anterior cingulate activity for control operations,Sohn, M.-H., Albert, M.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 100(8): 4951‚Äì4956. ===Education=== ACT-R has been often adopted as the foundation for cognitive tutors.Lewis, M. W., Milson, R., & Anderson, J. R. (1987). The teacher's apprentice: Designing an intelligent authoring system for high school mathematics. In G. P. Kearsley (Ed.), Artificial Intelligence and Instruction. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley. .Anderson, J. R. & Gluck, K. (2001). What role do cognitive architectures play in intelligent tutoring systems? In D. Klahr & S. M. Carver (Eds.) Cognition & Instruction: Twenty-five years of progress, 227‚Äì262. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. . These systems use an internal ACT-R model to mimic the behavior of a student and personalize his/her instructions and curriculum, trying to \\"guess\\" the difficulties that students may have and provide focused help. Such \\"Cognitive Tutors\\" are being used as a platform for research on learning and cognitive modeling as part of the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center. Some of the most successful applications, like the Cognitive Tutor for Mathematics, are used in thousands of schools across the United States. ==Brief historyEarly years: 1973‚Äì1990=== ACT-R is the ultimate successor of a series of increasingly precise models of human cognition developed by John R. Anderson. Its roots can be backtraced to the original HAM (Human Associative Memory) model of memory, described by John R. Anderson and Gordon Bower in 1973.Anderson, J. R., & Bower, G. H. (1973). Human associative memory. Washington, DC: Winston and Sons. The HAM model was later expanded into the first version of the ACT theory.Anderson, J. R. (1976) Language, memory, and thought. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. . This was the first time the procedural memory was added to the original declarative memory system, introducing a computational dichotomy that was later proved to hold in human brain.Cohen, N. J., & Squire, L. R. (1980). Preserved learning and retention of pattern- analyzing skill in amnesia: dissociation of knowing how and knowing that. Science, 210(4466), 207‚Äì210 The theory was then further extended into the ACT* model of human cognition.Anderson, J. R. (1983). The architecture of cognition. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. . ===Integration with rational analysis: 1990‚Äì1998=== In the late eighties, Anderson devoted himself to exploring and outlining a mathematical approach to cognition that he named Rational analysis.Anderson, J. R. (1990) The adaptive character of thought. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. . The basic assumption of Rational Analysis is that cognition is optimally adaptive, and precise estimates of cognitive functions mirror statistical properties of the environment.Anderson, J. R., & Schooler, L. J. (1991). Reflections of the environment in memory. Psychological Science, 2, 396‚Äì408. Later on, he came back to the development of the ACT theory, using the Rational Analysis as a unifying framework for the underlying calculations. To highlight the importance of the new approach in the shaping of the architecture, its name was modified to ACT-R, with the \\"R\\" standing for \\"Rational\\" Anderson, J. R. (1993). Rules of the mind. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. . In 1993, Anderson met with Christian Lebiere, a researcher in connectionist models mostly famous for developing with Scott Fahlman the Cascade Correlation learning algorithm. Their joint work culminated in the release of ACT-R 4.0.Anderson, J. R., & Lebiere, C. (1998). The atomic components of thought. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. . Thanks to Mike Byrne (now at Rice University), version 4.0 also included optional perceptual and motor capabilities, mostly inspired from the EPIC architecture, which greatly expanded the possible applications of the theory. ===Brain Imaging and Modular Structure: 1998‚Äì2015=== After the release of ACT-R 4.0, John Anderson became more and more interested in the underlying neural plausibility of his life- time theory, and began to use brain imaging techniques pursuing his own goal of understanding the computational underpinnings of human mind. The necessity of accounting for brain localization pushed for a major revision of the theory. ACT-R 5.0 introduced the concept of modules, specialized sets of procedural and declarative representations that could be mapped to known brain systems.Anderson, J. R., et al. (2004) An integrated theory of the mind. Psychological Review, 111(4). 1036‚Äì1060 In addition, the interaction between procedural and declarative knowledge was mediated by newly introduced buffers, specialized structures for holding temporarily active information (see the section above). Buffers were thought to reflect cortical activity, and a subsequent series of studies later confirmed that activations in cortical regions could be successfully related to computational operations over buffers. A new version of the code, completely rewritten, was presented in 2005 as ACT-R 6.0. It also included significant improvements in the ACT-R coding language. This included a new mechanism in ACT-R production specification called dynamic pattern matching. Unlike previous versions which required the pattern matched by a production to include specific slots for the information in the buffers, dynamic pattern matching allows the slots to be matched to also be specified by the buffer contents. A description and motivation for the ACT-R 6.0 is given in Anderson (2007).Anderson, J. R. (2007). How can the human mind occur in the physical universe? New York, NY: Oxford University Press. . ===ACT-R 7.0: 2015-Present=== At the 2015 workshop, it was argued that software changes required an increment in the model numbering to ACT-R 7.0, A major software change was removal of the requirement that chunks must be specified based on predefined chunk-types. The chunk-type mechanism was not removed, but changed from being a required construct of the architecture to being an optional syntactic mechanism in the software. This allowed for more flexibility in knowledge representation for modeling tasks that require learning novel information and extended the functionality provided through dynamic pattern matching now allowing models to create new \\"types\\" of chunks. This also lead to a simplification of the syntax required for specifying the actions in a production because all the actions now have the same syntactic form. The ACT-R software has also been subsequently updated to include a remote interface based on JSON RPC 1.0. That interface was added to make it easier to build tasks for models and work with ACT-R from languages other than Lisp, and the tutorial included with the software has been updated to provide Python implementations for all of the example tasks performed by the tutorial models. ===Spin-offs=== The long development of the ACT-R theory gave birth to a certain number of parallel and related projects. The most important ones are the PUPS production system, an initial implementation of Anderson's theory, later abandoned; and ACT-RN, a neural network implementation of the theory developed by Christian Lebiere. Lynne M. Reder, also at Carnegie Mellon University, developed in the early nineties SAC, a model of conceptual and perceptual aspects of memory that shares many features with the ACT-R core declarative system, although differing in some assumptions. ==Notes== ==References== * Anderson, J.

He was the eldest son of Egyptus, who was the daughter of Ham and Egyptus. Pharaoh was a descendant of the Canaanites (Abraham 1:22), a race of people who had been cursed with black skin (Moses 7:8). Mormon leaders have taught that he inherited the curse of Cain through his grandmother, Egyptus, so that the devil might have representation upon the earth. ==Enemy of Abraham== Non-Biblical accounts of Abraham's life are replete with stories of his life being in danger. While the story of the Egyptian priest is absent, there are others of Abraham life being sought when he was an infant, of the magicians of the king's court seeking his life, of his life being in danger for preaching against idolatry to Nimrod the king, of his being cast into a fiery furnace and receiving no harm, and others. These stories contain elements common to the Abraham chapter 1 story, including:Traditions about the Early Life of Abraham, by J. Tvedtnes, B. Hauglid, J.

It consists of the Chamber of Representatives (Dutch: , , ) and the Senate (Dutch: , , ). It sits in the Palace of the Nation (, , ). The Chamber of Representatives is the primary legislative body; the Senate functions only as a meeting place of the federal communities and regions. The Constitution does not mention the Federal Parliament as such; it stipulates that the federal legislative power is exercised by the King and the Chamber of Representatives (and exceptionally the Senate), and defines when the United Chambers convene. == Chamber of Representatives == The Chamber of Representatives holds its plenary meetings in the Palace of the Nation, Brussels. Eligibility requirements for the Chamber are a minimum age of 21, citizenship, and residency in Belgium. The number of seats in the Chamber is constitutionally set at 150 elected from 11 electoral districts. The districts are divided along linguistic lines: 5 Flemish (79 seats), 5 Walloon (49 seats), and the bilingual district of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde (22 seats). The districts are the provinces, except for the districts of Leuven (part of Flemish Brabant) and Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde. Each district is given a number of seats proportional to its population (not number of voters) ranging from 4 for Luxembourg to 24 for Antwerp. All districts have an electoral threshold of 5%, except for Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde and Leuven; all districts are monolingual, except for Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde which encompasses both the 19 bilingual municipalities from the Brussels-Capital region and some 35 Dutch-speaking municipalities in Flemish Brabant, incl. 7 with language facilities for French-speakers. The current composition was elected at the federal elections of 2019. == Senate == Since 2014, the Senate consists of 60 members. There are two categories of senators: co-opted senators and senators of community and regional parliaments. 50 senators are elected by and from the community and regional parliaments: 29 by the Flemish Parliament, 10 by the Parliament of the French Community, 8 by the Walloon Parliament, 2 by the French-language group of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region, and 1 by the Parliament of the German-speaking Community. The 10 other senators are co- opted: elected by the 50 other senators. Eligibility requirements for the Senate are identical to those for the Chamber. Before 2014, the Senate consisted of 71 senators, only 21 of which were elected by the community parliaments. 25 were directly elected by the Flemish-speaking constituency and 15 by the French-speaking constituency. The last direct election of these 40 members occurred in the 2010 federal elections. The 2014 elections are the first one with the reformed Senate. The President of the Senate since 2014 has been Christine Defraigne (MR). The Senate holds its plenary meetings in the Palace of the Nation, Brussels. == Legislative procedure == Since the elections of 21 May 1995, there has been a breakdown of powers between the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate, which resulted in the latter having fewer competences than the Chamber of Representatives. Prior to that, the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate did the same parliamentary work on an equal footing, but now there are three different legislative procedures that can be followed: the one-chamber procedure, the optional two-chamber procedure, and the mandatory two-chamber procedure. In certain matters both Chambers have equal power. These include constitutional revisions, laws requiring a qualified majority, laws on the basic structure of the Belgian State, laws approving agreements of cooperation between the Federal State, the Communities and the Regions, laws on the approval of international treaties, and laws on the organisation of the judiciary, the Council of State, and the Constitutional Court. In this case, the mandatory bicameral procedure applies, which means that both Chambers must pass exactly the same version of the bill. For most other legislation, the Chamber of Representatives takes precedence over the Senate and the optional bicameral procedure applies. This means that the Senate may still intervene as a chamber of consideration and reflection. It has the opportunity to, within specific time limits, examine the bills adopted by the Chamber of Representatives and, if there is a reason to do so, make amendments. The Chamber may subsequently adopt or reject the amendments proposed by the Senate or make new proposals. The Senate can also submit a bill it has adopted to the Chamber, which can approve, reject or amend it. Whatever the case, the Chamber has the final word. The one-chamber procedure applies in cases where the Chamber of Representatives has the sole power to legislate. It means that the Senate cannot intervene and that the Senate's approval is not required for the bill to pass. The matters for which the Chamber of Representatives is exclusively responsible include naturalisations, ministerial liability, State budget and accounts and military quotas. == United Chambers == The United Chambers (, , ) is the name given to the body created when both chambers of the Federal Parliament meet in joint session. The United Chambers are convened only on certain occasions enumerated in the Belgian Constitution: the King must take the constitutional oath before the United Chambers, in accordance with article 91 of the Constitution, and the United Chambers must provide for the regency in the event that the successor to the Crown is a minor or the King is unable to reign, in accordance with articles 92 and 93 of the Constitution. The last session of the United Chambers took place on 21 July 2013, when King Philippe of Belgium took the constitutional oath. == Palace of the Nation == A view of the Palace of the Nation in the 1890s The Palace of the Nation (; ) was built to a Neoclassical design by French architect Gilles-Barnab√© Guimard from 1779 to 1783 and includes sculptures by Gilles-Lambert Godecharle. Under Austrian rule it housed the Sovereign Council of Brabant before being used as a courthouse during the French period. During the Dutch period it was one of two homes of the Parliament of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, the other being in the Hague. The provisional Government of Belgium and the Belgian National Congress moved into the building in 1830 and the first session of the House of Representatives and Senate was held there a year later. It stands near the site of the former palace of the Dukes of Brabant, which was destroyed by fire in 1731, and has itself been badly damaged by fire, in 1820 and 1883. == See also == * Politics of Belgium * Court of Audit of Belgium * List of political parties in Belgium * Brussels Parliament * Flemish Parliament * Commission communautaire fran√ßaise * Parliament of the German-speaking Community * Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie * Walloon Parliament * Parliament of the French Community * List of legislatures by country ==References== == External links == * Chamber of Representatives * Senate Belgium Belgium Belgium ","title":"Belgian Federal Parliament"},{"id":"821177","text":"Charles Osgood Wood III (born January 8, 1933), known professionally as Charles Osgood, is a retired American radio and television commentator and writer.

(today WWRC and WTOP-FM respectively). Shortly afterward, however, he enlisted in the military to be the announcer for the United States Army Band. In 1991, he explained this turn of events in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. :[After college graduation] I went right to work for a classical musical [sic] station in Washington called WGMS. I was an announcer. I learned a lot doing that. :I was about to be drafted in the Army, this was 1954, and I ran into a guy while I was having dinner with a friend of mine and he was dressed in a white uniform, the most fancy uniform this side of the Ritz Hotel. It turned out he was the announcer for the United States Army Band. I asked him when he was getting out and he said within the next few weeks, so the next morning I was parked out at the commanding officer's office. He was impressed with the fact I could pronounce Rimsky-Korsakov. That's how I got the job. I spent three years with the United States Army Band. It was a great experience. Besides acting as the band's master of ceremonies, he performed as a pianist with the band and sang with the United States Army Chorus. His roommate was John Cacavas who composed arrangements for the band. They would collaborate on many songs, a relationship that would continue through the 1960s. In 1967, along with U.S. Senator Everett Dirksen (R-Illinois) together they won a Grammy Award for best spoken word performance for their single Gallant Men. As Dirksen read a patriotic poem written by H. Paul Jeffers about the dignity of duty in the armed forces, it was framed by Cacavas and Osgood's martial music and stirring choral refrains. In 1967 it peaked at number 16 on the Billboard 200 record chart. ===Other work=== Stationed adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery at Fort Myer during his service with the U.S. Army Band, using pseudonyms Osgood worked as an announcer for radio stations in the Washington area to supplement his income and experience. He hosted the morning show on WEAM (WZHF today) as \\"Charlie Woods.\\" At WGMS, he called himself \\"Carl Walden.\\" At WPGC (AM) (WJFK (AM) today), a rock station, he referred to himself as \\"Chuck Forest.\\" In September 1955, President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a serious heart attack during a vacation in Denver, Colorado and was confined to a hospital room there until November. During this time, under the auspices of WGMS Osgood hosted a closed-circuit program of classical music delivered exclusively to the president's room to encourage his relaxation and convalescence. ===WGMS Radio=== When his tour with the U.S. Army Band was completed, in October 1957 Osgood returned to WGMS full-time as announcer Charles Wood and as a special assistant to the general manager. Before the end of 1958, WGMS promoted him to program director. In 1960, credited by name and as a WGMS announcer, he provided introductions and commentary on a six-record album of a collection of thirty-three speeches by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt titled FDR Speaks. Edited by historian Henry Steele Commager, it included a welcome by the president's widow, former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Their son Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Jr. recited one of his father's speeches. The Billboard magazine reported that FDR Speaks \\"was one of the most listened-to-attractions\\" at the 1960 Democratic National Convention which nominated senators John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson as its candidates for President and Vice President of the United States. ===WHCT Television=== In April 1962, the parent company of WGMS, RKO General, transferred Osgood to Hartford, Connecticut and promoted him to his first job in television: the general manager of Channel 18, WHCT (WUVN today). WHCT was the first TV station in the United States to be licensed to use Phonevision, a system developed by Zenith that scrambled the station's picture and sound. This limited viewing to paid subscribers who were issued decoders attached to their television sets and telephone lines. The station offered its subscribers premium programming such as first-run movies, live sporting events, and cultural programs like ballets and symphonies, all with no commercials. Although RKO expected to operate WHCT at a loss for the three years before the Federal Communications Commission was due to renew the station's license, by early 1963 the financial realities became too difficult to bear unabated. In a 1985 interview with Broadcasting magazine, Osgood explained: :[The station] lost money at an alarming rate... [RKO] left me off the hook very gently. They said, \\"you‚Äôre fired.\\" ===ABC=== Unemployed at age 30, Osgood turned to one of his Fordham classmates, Frank McGuire, who directed program development at ABC in New York. In 1963 McGuire hired Osgood to be one of the writers and hosts of Flair Reports which related human interest stories on the ABC Radio Network. :\\"I went from being the world's youngest station manager to being the world's oldest cub reporter\\", he quipped in a 1981 interview with People magazine. Another new McGuire hire for Flair Reports whom Osgood befriended at ABC was Ted Koppel. Becoming \\"Charles Osgood\\" He began using the name \\"Charles Osgood\\" at ABC because the network already had an announcer named \\"Charles Woods.\\" In a 2005 interview with Inside Radio, Osgood related the story: :They didn't want to have a Charles Woods and a Charles Wood. When they told me to pick a name, I used my middle name as my last name. It's worked out well and is a little more distinctive and professional. ==Later career at CBS== Osgood moved over to CBS Radio in 1967 when it became clear, in his words, that he \\"wasn't going anywhere\\" at ABC. He ended up working in both radio and television at CBS. === Radio === Osgood worked as a reporter and anchor for WCBS. In August 1967, he anchored the first morning drive shift for WCBS after its conversion to an all-news format. The first day of all-news programming aired on WCBS-FM after an airplane crashed into the AM station's antenna tower on New York's High Island, keeping WCBS off air until a temporary tower could be erected. Osgood was host of Westwood One's The Osgood File, heard four times each weekday morning drive time on radio stations nationwide. Each three-minute Osgood File focused on a single story, ranging from a breaking development of national importance to a whimsical human- interest vignette. Some of those he did in rhyme, which is why he was known as CBS's \\"Poet in Residence.\\" He continued these broadcasts until December 29, 2017. === Television === On television, Osgood joined CBS news in 1971. He was a reporter, and served as anchor of the CBS Sunday Night News from 1981 to 1987, co-anchor of the weekday CBS Morning News and frequent news reader on CBS This Morning from 1987 to 1992, as well as occasional anchor of the CBS Afternoon News and the CBS Evening News with Dan Rather. In one of his best known roles, he hosted CBS News Sunday Morning from April 10, 1994 to September 25, 2016, succeeding the original host Charles Kuralt. Osgood's tenure of twenty-two years as host exceeded Kuralt's fifteen years. Among his personal trademarks were his bow-tie, his weekly TV signoff \\"Until then, I'll see you on the radio\\", and his propensity for delivering his commentaries in whimsical verse. Example: When the Census Bureau invented a designation for cohabitant(s) as \\"Person(s) of Opposite Sex Sharing Living Quarters\\", or \\"POSSLQ\\", Osgood turned it into a pronounceable three-syllable word and composed a prospective love poem that included these lines, which he later used as the title of one of his books: :\\"There's nothing that I wouldn't do :If you would be my POSSLQ.\\" Osgood regularly pronounced the 21st-century years 2001, 2002, etc., as \\"twenty oh one, twenty oh two...\\" as opposed to the more common \\"two thousand one, two thousand two\\", etc. === End of broadcasting career === On December 21, 2017, it was announced that Osgood would retire from the radio show due to health concerns ending his broadcast career. His final broadcasts were on December 29, 2017. ==Other works== In 1956, Osgood wrote a three-act play called A Single Voice. He was voice of the narrator in the 2008 animated film Horton Hears a Who!. He wrote a biweekly syndicated newspaper column. He is the author of six books: Nothing Could Be Finer Than a Crisis That Is Minor in the Morning (Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1979); There's Nothing That I Wouldn't Do If You Would Be My POSSLQ (Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1981); Osgood on Speaking: How to Think on Your Feet Without Falling on Your Face (William Morrow and Company, 1988); The Osgood Files (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1991); See You on the Radio (G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1999); and the most recent, Defending Baltimore Against Enemy Attack (Hyperion, 2004). ==Personal life== Osgood raised his family in Englewood, New Jersey. He and his wife, Jeanne Crafton, have five children. When they became empty nesters, Osgood and his wife moved to a 12 room duplex on West 57th Street at 7th Avenue in New York City. Osgood's nephew, Emmy Award-winning composer Christopher Mangum, composes film scores, including themes for National Geographic specials and The Discovery Channel. ==Honors== * 1990: National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame, radio division * 2004: Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism. * 2005: Paul White Award, Radio Television Digital News Association ==See also== * New Yorkers in journalism ==ReferencesOfficial CBS biography * The Osgood File * * Category:1933 births Category:Living people Category:American television news anchors Category:American broadcast news analysts Category:American television reporters and correspondents Category:American radio journalists Category:CBS News people Category:Military personnel from New York City Category:Fordham University alumni Category:People from Englewood, New Jersey Category:People from Manhattan Category:20th-century American journalists Category:21st-century American journalists Category:Journalists from New York City Category:60 Minutes correspondents ","title":"Charles Osgood"},{"id":"821181","text":"\\"Inca Mummy Girl\\" is episode four of season two of the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, originally airing on October 6, 1997. The episode was written by former series story editors Matt Kiene and Joe Reinkemeyer (penning their second and final script for the show) and directed by Ellen S. Pressman, inspired by the story of Momia Juanita, a real mummy discovered on the extinct volcano Ampato near Arequipa, Peru, in 1995.https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/2006-08-30-ice-maiden- melt_x.htm The narrative revolves around a cultural exchange event at Sunnydale High, involving a museum exhibit, a dance, and foreign exchange students, two of whom stay with Buffy and Cordelia. ==Plot== To prepare for Sunnydale High's cultural exchange program, Buffy visits an Incan exhibit with her schoolmates. She is paired with an exchange student with whom her mom signed her up. Xander becomes jealous when he learns that she will room with a guy. The students learn that the mummy in the museum is one of a beautiful Incan princess, sacrificed by her people to save them from destruction. Willow and Buffy express remorse for the princess; dying before she could really live her life. After everyone leaves the museum, a class clown breaks the seal on the mummy while trying to steal it. The princess wakes up, for the curse is broken, and pulls the student into her coffin. She mummifies him by a kiss on the lips. When the Scoobies rush to the museum, they encounter a sword- wielding guard and the remains of the missing student. Buffy's exchange student arrives at the bus station, but the mummy girl sucks out his life too. The 500-year-old becomes a beautiful teenager, and poses as \\"Ampata,\\" the boy who was supposed to stay with Buffy (everyone simply assumes that the information was wrong on her sex). Xander is smitten with her, and the two begin a relationship. Giles asks Ampata to decipher the seal from her tomb, and she explains (reluctantly) that it describes a girl chosen to die to save her people, and a bodyguard who will keep her from straying from that path. She also tells Giles to destroy the seal completely. The bodyguard appears again and again, trying to stop Ampata, until she finally manages to use her kiss on him in the bathroom, sucking out his life to keep herself from dying. Buffy and Ampata bond over the tale of the Inca Princess, Ampata stating that the princess was forced into her destiny by her people, as they claimed she was the only girl of her generation who could save them; Buffy miserably notes that this parallels her own life. Xander asks Ampata to the dance to enliven her; she gladly accepts. Willow is downcast to see her crush with another girl. Meanwhile, Buffy and Giles open Ampata's trunk and discover the real Ampata's body. Giles tries to piece together the seal while Buffy tries to save Xander from Ampata's deadly kiss. But Ampata feels too much for Xander and leaves for the museum. She tries to stop Giles from putting the seal back together. Buffy saves Giles, then Ampata starts to deteriorate as she tries to feed off Willow. Xander shows up and insists that if she must feed on anyone, it should be him; despite Ampata's feelings for him, she is quickly deteriorating back into a mummy, and is willing to kill him to remain alive. Buffy shows up to fight her, saving Xander, and in the battle, Ampata weakens to the point of returning to her dead form. ==Cast== * Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy Summers * Nicholas Brendon as Xander Harris * Alyson Hannigan as Willow Rosenberg * Charisma Carpenter as Cordelia Chase * David Boreanaz as Angel (credited but does not appear) * Anthony Stewart Head as Rupert Giles * Kristine Sutherland as Joyce Summers * Ara Celi as Ampata Gutierrez / Inca Mummy Girl * Seth Green as Oz * Jason Hall as Devon MacLeish * Henrik Rosvall as Sven * Danny Strong as Jonathan Levinson * Gil Birmingham as Peru guard ==Arc significance== * This episode features the first appearance of Seth Green as Oz, who will go on to be Willow's beau and is the guitarist in the band 'Dingoes Ate My Baby' (played by 'Four Star Mary'). * This episode also features the first appearance of Danny Strong as Jonathan Levinson, named as such in the end credits although the character's name is not used in dialogue. ==Reception== \\"Inca Mummy Girl\\" had an audience of 3.2 million households.\\"Nielsen Ratings for Buffy's Second Season .\\" ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * * Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 2) episodes Category:1997 American television episodes Category:Human- mummy romance in fiction Category:Mummies in fiction Category:South America in fiction Category:Fictional indigenous people of the Americas ","title":"Inca Mummy Girl"},{"id":"821197","text":"A cognitive tutor is a particular kind of intelligent tutoring system that utilizes a cognitive model to provide feedback to students as they are working through problems. This feedback will immediately inform students of the correctness, or incorrectness, of their actions in the tutor interface; however, cognitive tutors also have the ability to provide context-sensitive hints and instruction to guide students towards reasonable next steps. == Introduction == The name of Cognitive Tutor¬Æ now usually refers to a particular type of intelligent tutoring system produced by Carnegie Learning for high school mathematics based on John Anderson's ACT-R theory of human cognition. However, cognitive tutors were originally developed to test ACT-R theory for research purposes since the early 1980s and they are developed also for other areas and subjects such as computer programming and science. Cognitive Tutors can be implemented into classrooms as a part of blended learning that combines textbook and software activities. The Cognitive Tutor programs utilize cognitive model and are based on model tracing and knowledge tracing. Model tracing means that the cognitive tutor checks every action performed by students such as entering a value or clicking a button, while knowledge tracing is used to calculate the required skills students learned by measuring them on a bar chart called Skillometer. Model tracing and knowledge tracing are essentially used to monitor students' learning progress, guide students to correct path to problem solving, and provide feedback. The Institute of Education Sciences published several reports regarding the effectiveness of Carnegie Cognitive Tutor¬Æ. A 2013 report concluded that Carnegie Learning Curricula and Cognitive Tutor¬Æ was found to have mixed effects on mathematics achievement for high school students. The report identified 27 studies that investigate the effectiveness of Cognitive Tutor ¬Æ, and the conclusion is based on 6 studies that meet What Works Clearinghouse standards. Among the 6 studies included, 5 of them show intermediate to significant positive effect, while 1 study shows statistically significant negative effect. Another report published by Institute of Education Sciences in 2009 found that Cognitive Tutor¬Æ Algebra I to have potentially positive effects on math achievement based on only 1 study out of 14 studies that meets What Works Clearinghouse standards.it should be understood that What Works Clearinghouse standards call for relatively large numbers of participants, true random assignments to groups, and for a control group receiving either no treatment or a different treatment. Such experimental conditions are difficult to meet in schools, and thus only a small percentage of studies in education meet the standards of this clearinghouse, even though they may still be of value. == Theoretical foundations  Four-component architecture === Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) traditionally had a three-component architecture: domain model, student model, and tutoring model. Later, a fourth component was added: the interface component. Now ITS is commonly known to have a four component architecture. Domain model contains the rules, concepts, and knowledge related to the domain to be learned. It helps to evaluate students' performance and detect students' errors by setting a standard of domain expertise. Student model, the central component of an ITS, is expected to contain as much knowledge as possible about the students: their cognitive and affective states, and the progress they gained as they learn. The functions of the student model is three folded: to gather data from and about the learner, to represent the learner's knowledge and learning process, and to perform diagnosis of students' knowledge and select optimal pedagogical strategies. Based on the data gained from domain model and student model, tutoring model makes decisions about tutoring strategies such as whether or not to intervene, when and how to intervene. Functions of tutoring model include instruction delivery and content planning. Interface model reflects the decisions made by tutoring model in different forms such as Socratic dialogs, feedback and hints. Students interact with the tutor through the learning interface, also known as communication. Interface also provide domain knowledge elements. === Cognitive model === A cognitive model tries to model the domain knowledge in the same way knowledge is represented in the human mind. Cognitive model enables intelligent tutoring systems to respond to problem-solving situations as the learner would. A tutoring system adopting a cognitive model is called a cognitive tutor. Cognitive model is an expert system which hosts a multitude of solutions to the problems presented to students. The cognitive model is used to trace each student's solution through complex problems, enabling the tutor to provide step-by-step feedback and advice, and to maintain a targeted model of the student's knowledge based on student performance. === Cognitive Tutors === Cognitive Tutors provide step- by-step guidance as a learner develops a complex problem-solving skill through practice. Typically, cognitive tutors provide such forms of support as: (a) a problem-solving environment that is designed rich and \\"thinking visible\\"; (b) step-by-step feedback on student performance; (c) feedback messages specific to errors; (d) context-specific next-step hints at student's request, and (e) individualized problem selection. Cognitive Tutors accomplish two of the principal tasks characteristic of human tutoring: (1) monitors the student's performance and providing context-specific individual instruction, and (2) monitors the student's learning and selects appropriate problem-solving activities. Both cognitive model and two underlying algorithms, model tracing and knowledge tracing, are used to monitor the student's learning. In model tracing, the cognitive tutor uses the cognitive model in complex problems to follow the student's individual path and provide prompt accuracy feedback and context-specific advice. In knowledge tracing, the cognitive tutor uses a simple Bayesian method of evaluating the student's knowledge and uses this student model to select appropriate problems for individual student. === Cognitive architecture === Cognitive tutors use a cognitive architecture which specifies the underlying framework for an intelligent system. ACT-R, a member of ACT family, is the most recent cognitive architecture, devoted primarily to modelling human behavior. ACT-R includes a declarative memory of factual knowledge and a procedural memory of production rules. The architecture functions by matching productions on perceptions and facts, mediated by the real-valued activation levels of objects, and executing them to affect the environment or alter declarative memory. ACT-R has been used to model psychological aspects such as memory, attention, reasoning, problem solving, and language processing.P. Langley and J. E. Laird, \\"Cognitive Architectures: Research Issues and Challenges\\". Draft of October 31, 2002. == Application and utilization == In 1984, a group of high school students used the geometry tutor and a mini course was talk in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University using the LISP tutor. This was the first iteration of the cognitive tutor. Since then, cognitive tutors have been used in a variety of scenarios, with a few organizations developing their own cognitive tutor programs. These programs have been used for students spanning elementary school through to university level, though primarily in the subject areas of Computer Programming, Mathematics, and Science. One of the first organizations to develop a system for use within the school system was the PACT Center at Carnegie Mellon University. Their aim was to \\"...develop systems that provide individualized assistance to students as they work on challenging real-world problems in complex domains such as computer programming, algebra and geometry\\". PACT's most successful product was the Cognitive Tutor Algebra course. Originally created in the early 1990s, this course, at its peak, was offered at 75 schools through the U.S. by 1999, and then its spin-off company, Carnegie Learning, now offers tutors to over 1400 schools in the U.S. The Carnegie Mellon Cognitive Tutor has attempted to raise students' math test scores in high school and middle-school classrooms, and their Algebra course was designated one of five exemplary curricula for K-12 mathematics educated by the US Department of Education. There were several research projects conducted by the PACT Center to utilize Cognitive tutor for courses in Excel and to develop an intelligent tutoring system for algebra expression writing, called Ms. Lindquist. Initially used by thousands of students, the aim of the Ms. Lindquist program was to have a tutor that could carry on running conversations with a student, with the intent of providing a more human connection. Further, in 2005, Carnegie Learning released Bridge to Algebra, a product intended for middle schools that was piloted in over 100 schools. Cognitive tutoring software is continuing to be used. According to a recent Business Insider Report article, Ken Koedinger, a professor of human-computer interaction and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, says teachers can integrate cognitive tutoring software into the classroom. He suggests that teachers use it in a computer lab environment or during classes. In its more current versions, cognitive tutors can understand the many ways that a student might answer a problem, and then assist the student at the exact time that the help is required. Further, the cognitive tutor can customize exercises specific to the student's needs. == Limitations == At this time it is unclear whether Cognitive Tutor¬Æ is effective at improving student performance. Cognitive Tutor¬Æ has had some commercial success however, there may be limitations inherently linked to its design and the nature of intelligent tutoring systems. The following section discusses limitations of Cognitive Tutor¬Æ which may also apply to other intelligent tutoring systems. ===Curriculum=== At this time, creating a Cognitive Tutor¬Æ for all subject areas is not practical or economical. Cognitive Tutor¬Æ has been used successfully but is still limited to tutoring algebra, computer programming and geometry because these subject areas have an optimal balance of production rules, complexity and maximum benefit to the learner. The focus of Cognitive Tutor¬Æ development has been the design of the software to teach specific production rules and not on the development of curricular content. Despite many years of trials, improvements, and a potential to advance learning objectives, the creators continue to rely primarily on outside sources for curricular direction. ===Design=== The complexity of Cognitive Tutor¬Æ software requires designers to spend hundreds of hours per instructional hour to create the program. Despite the time invested, the challenges associated with meeting the needs of the learner within the constraints of the design often result in compromises in flexibility and cognitive fidelity. Practicality dictates that designers must choose from a discrete set of methods to teach and support learners. Limited choices of methods, prompts and hints may be effective in supporting some learners but may conflict with the methods already in use by others. In addition, it is possible that learners will use the system of prompts and hints to access the answers prematurely thereby advancing through the exercises which may result in them not meeting the learning objectives. ===Model=== The cognitive model, which inspired Cognitive Tutor¬Æ is based on assumptions about how learning occurs which dictates the chosen instructional methods such as hints, directions and timing of the tutoring prompts. Given these assumptions and the limited methods of presentation, Cognitive Tutor¬Æ may not account for the flexible, complex and diverse ways humans create knowledge. Human tutors outperform Cognitive Tutor¬Æ by providing a higher level of responsiveness to student errors. They are capable of providing more effective feedback and scaffolding to learners than Cognitive Tutor¬Æ, indicating the cognitive model may still be incomplete. == See also == * Educational psychology == References == == External links== *Pittsburgh Advanced Cognitive Tutor Center, of Carnegie Mellon University, which researches cognitive tutors *Product page for Cognitive Tutor at Carnegie Learning *Evaluation of Cognitive Tutor Algebra I Program in Miami-Dade County Public Schools *Overview of evaluations of Cognitive Tutor *Cognitive Tutors: The End of Boredom and Confusion?, Survey article (2018) Category:Artificial intelligence Category:Educational software Category:Educational psychology ","title":"Cognitive tutor"},{"id":"821236","text":"Victoria Josefa Dolores Catalina Sackville-West, Lady Sackville (23 September 1862 - 30 January 1936) married her first cousin Lionel Edward Sackville-West, 3rd Baron Sackville. Their daughter was the writer, poet and gardener Vita Sackville-West. The family lived mainly at Knole House, an estate that had been in the Sackville family for centuries. Victoria, having experienced a controversial life herself, has since been mostly displaced in the public's consciousness by the colourful life of her daughter Vita. ==Early life== Victoria was one of seven illegitimate children of the English diplomat Lionel Sackville-West, 2nd Baron Sackville, and a Spanish dancer known by the stage name of \\"Pepita de Oliva\\", (Josefa n√©e Dur√°n y Ortega; she was married to Juan Antonio de Oliva). Pepita was referred to as Countess West, though she never divorced her legal husband or married the father of her children. Victoria was, in youth, referred to as Pepita Sackville West, or 'Lolo', a diminutive of her name Dolores. Whilst at convent school in 1881, however, the truth of her origins was revealed, and she was advised to be known as Victoria West. Victoria's siblings included sisters Flora (born 1866), Amalia Marguerite Albertine (born 1868), and Eliza (who died in 1866, the year after her birth ); and brothers Ernest Henry Jean Baptiste (born 1869), Maximiliano (born 1858), and a short-lived brother named Frederic who died, along with their mother, soon after his birth in March 1871. Victoria was notorious for beginning and dropping various money-making schemes, some intended for supposedly charitable aims, but most for her personal use. Amongst the schemes was one involving the opening of a shop in South Audley Street, London which Victoria wanted to name Knole Guild following a charitable scheme she had started in Kent of that name. Her husband Lord Sackville objected, and it was doubtless pointed out that the shop was for her own pecuniary benefit and not that of a charity. It was, in the end, named Spealls. Victoria was not good at retailing, and enlisted the services of her even less suitable daughter Vita, to contribute to the store's stocks. The shop ended in failure, as did many of Victoria's enterprises. Victoria's life has been largely overshadowed by the controversial life of her bisexual daughter, Hon. Victoria (Vita) Sackville- West. Lady Sackville was a close friend of the sculptor Auguste Rodin; his marble bust of her, dated 1913, is on display at the Rodin Museum. ==Houses== Long a friend, companion, patroness and mistress (1916-1926) Lutyens and The Edwardians Jane Brown of the architect Edwin Lutyens, she engaged Lutyens to remodel a house for her at Sussex Square, Brighton, She is also attributed with commissioning Lutyens to build other houses, for example White Lodge at Roedean, Brighton and another for her guests at Worthing. She also commissioned Lutyens to remodel two houses in London, at Ebury Square, Belgravia and at Hill Street, Mayfair. ==Later life== Increasingly intolerant of her husband's infidelities, which were carried out in plain sight at their home at Knole, Lady Sackville removed herself to a house on the clifftop overlooking Brighton, Sussex called White Lodge. Her daughter claimed in her book Pepita that Victoria's departure followed what to her appeared to be a subtle argument. Lord Sackville, having experienced war service, was, on his return, more active in the management of Knole. He merely told Lady Sackville that she should inform their bailiff if she wished to take any of their workmen away from the duties to which they had been allotted by the bailiff. She was not to interfere in matters otherwise, whereas she clearly felt she was the rightful chatelaine of the ancient property. While at White Lodge, she indulged in increasingly eccentric schemes, mostly designed to raise funds for her own benefit given her straitened circumstances. She had experienced at least a couple of nervous breakdowns earlier in her life and seems to have declined into a state of litigiousness, perhaps from an increasingly pressing sense of persecution owing to her illegitimacy and lack of belonging. She became notorious for the number of writs she issued, and was even credited with referring to her home as the \\"Writs Hotel\\". ==References== ==External links== * \\"Chester Arthur and Victoria Sackville\\", American-presidents.org; accessed 15 April 2014. * Category:1862 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Daughters of barons Category:English people of Spanish descent Victoria Sackville-West, Baroness Sackville Victoria ","title":"Victoria Sackville-West, Baroness Sackville"},{"id":"821262","text":"Joseph (\\"Josy\\") Barthel (24 April 1927 - 7 July 1992) was a Luxembourgish athlete. He was the surprise winner of the Men's 1500 metres at the 1952 Summer Olympics, and the only athlete representing Luxembourg to have won a gold medal at the Olympics.Luxembourger Michel Th√©ato won the marathon in 1900, but the IOC officially credits him as having represented France, despite later research proving his nationality. Besides athletics, Barthel also led successful careers in both chemistry and politics. ==Biography== Born in Mamer, Josy Barthel's abilities as a middle-distance runner was discovered during World War II. His first fame came by winning the 800 m at the Military World Championships in Berlin in 1947. The next year at Military World Championships in Brussels he won both 800 m and 1500 m. At the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, Barthel finished ninth at the 1500 m final. Then he won Student World Championships in 1949 (1500 m) and 1951 (800 m and 1500 m). The absolute high point of Barthel's career was the 1952 Summer Olympics, where he surprised the crowd and himself by winning the 1500 m with a very strong finish. He also participated at the 1956 Summer Olympics, after which he retired from running. He was also Luxembourg champion in 800 m and 1500 m from 1946 to 1956. In 1962 Barthel became the president of the Luxembourg Athletics Federation, then from 1973 to 1977 he was the president of the Luxembourgish Olympic and Sporting Committee. He was also member of the Luxembourg government from 1977 to 1984. Josy Barthel died in Luxembourg City after a severe illness. The national stadium of Luxembourg, home to the Luxembourg national football team, was named Stade Josy Barthel in his honor. The Lyc√©e Technique Josy Barthel in Mamer also bears his name. In 2006, Barthel was accused of doping by sports journalist Erik Eggers in the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel. Eggers cited German physician Oskar Wegener who did research on methamphetamine and other doping substances in the 1950s. Wegener strongly denied saying Barthel had any connection with doping. The use of such substances was neither prohibited nor controlled until the 1960s. ==Footnotes== ==External links== * - - - - Category:Luxembourgian male middle-distance runners Category:Luxembourgian sportsperson-politicians Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1948 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1952 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1956 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic athletes of Luxembourg Category:Olympic gold medalists for Luxembourg Category:Ministers for the Environment of Luxembourg Category:Ministers for Transport of Luxembourg Category:Ministers for Energy of Luxembourg Category:Councillors in Luxembourg City Category:Democratic Party (Luxembourg) politicians Category:Luxembourgian chemists Category:1927 births Category:1992 deaths Category:People from Mamer Category:Alumni of the Ath√©n√©e de Luxembourg Category:Medalists at the 1952 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists in athletics (track and field) ","title":"Josy Barthel"},{"id":"821301","text":"lMule (short for \\"Linux Mule\\") was an early attempt to bring an eMule-like client to Linux started in January 2003 by Timo Kujala, who ported all eMule code to Linux by himself.

It refers to positions on the extreme left and right sides of the pitch, or playing field (the \\"wings\\"). In American football and Canadian football, the analogous position is the wide receiver. Wingers often try to use pace to exploit extra space available on the flanks that can be made available by their teammates dominating the centre ground. They must be wary however of not crossing the touchline, or sidelines, and going out of play. In sports where the main method of scoring involves attacking a small goal (by whatever name) in the centre of the field, a common tactic is to cross the ball to a central teammate. ==Association football== In football, a winger is an attacking midfielder in a wide position. Wingers are usually players of great pace or dribbling ability so as to provide cut-backs or crosses from which strikers can score. Their main function is to support attack from the wings. Wingers do much high-speed running from defence to attack. ==Australian rules football== In Australian rules football, the wingers or wingmen require considerable pace and stamina, as they run up and down the ground linking play between defence and attack and are normally highly skilled in kicking. ==Ice hockey== \\"Winger\\", in ice hockey, is a forward position of a player whose primary zone of play on the ice is along the outer playing area. They typically work by flanking the centre forward. Originally the name was given to forward players who went up and down the sides of the rink. Nowadays, there are different types of wing men in the game‚Äîout-and-out goal scorers, checkers who disrupt the opponents and forwards who work along the boards and in the corners. This position is typically just called \\"Wing\\", often preceded by the side on which the player normally skates (Left Wing or Right Wing). ==Handball== In handball there are two wing positions: left wing and right wing. In a typical team, these positions are occupied by fast and relatively small players. One of their main jobs in a game are fast attacks. ==Rugby football== Wingers or wings play on either the extreme left or the extreme right. They are usually the fastest players on the field and score the most tries. Wingers often fall back with the fullback to take kicks from the opposition. There are two s in a rugby league team, numbered 2 and 5. There are two wings in a rugby union team, numbered 11 and 14. ==See also== * Association football positions * Rugby league positions * Rugby union positions Category:Sports terminology ","title":"Winger (sports)"},{"id":"821324","text":"xMule ‚Äî the X11 Mule ‚Äî is a client for the eDonkey peer-to-peer file sharing network, originally intended to bring it to virtually all the major Unix platforms, with a particular emphasis on Linux.

He was a brother of Sri Aurobindo. ==Background== Manmohan Ghose was born the son of Dr. Krishna Dhan Ghose by his wife, Swarnalata Devi Ghose n√©e Basu. His ancestral village was Konnagar , Hooghly District , West Bengal.Bandyopadhyay, Amritalal, Rishi Aurobindo, 1964, Biswas Publishing House, p 6 His family was Bengali and upper caste Hindu, and were among the early adopters of English education. Consequently, they had acquired affluence and the prestige of holding government jobs. Their religion and culture had also been affected by westernization, and they had flirted briefly with the Brahmo Samaj. Manmohan's father, Krishna Dhun Ghose, was a doctor in the government service, who served as Assistant Surgeon of Rangpur in Bengal. Formerly a member of the Brahmo Samaj religious reform movement, he had become enamoured with the then-new idea of evolution while pursuing medical studies in Britain. Manmohan's mother, Swarnalata Devi, was the daughter of Shri Rajnarayan Bose, a leading figure in the Brahmo Samaj.he was the best friend of laurence binyon. Manmohan was the second of siblings. The eldest was his brother, Benoybhusan Ghose, then Manmohan himself, then his brother Sri Aurobindo (the famous revolutionary and ascetic) followed by his only sister Sarojini, and last of all was another brother, Barindrakumar (usually referred to as Barin). ==Career== He was educated at Manchester Grammar School (1881‚Äì84), St Paul's school in London (1884‚Äì87) and won an open scholarship to Christ Church, Oxford. His work was published in Primavera:Poems by Four Authors (1890), with Laurence Binyon, Arthur S. Cripps, and Stephen Phillips. Ghose later met Oscar Wilde at the Fitzroy Street Settlement, who reviewed Primavera in Pall Mall Gazette, with particular favour towards Ghose. During this time in London Ghose met many other members of the \\"Rhymers' Club\\" set such as Lionel Johnson, Ernest Dowson, who were both very fond of him. In 1893, after his father's death, Ghose returned to India and took a series of teaching posts at Patna, Bankipur, and Calcutta. In 1897, he was appointed Assistant Professor of Dacca College. After the death of his wife Malati Banerjee in 1918, his health deteriorated and he aged prematurely. For 30 years Ghose had cherished the dream of returning to England and even booked a passage along with his daughter in March 1924, but after a short illness on 4 January 1924 he died in Calcutta. His daughter left for London and met Laurence Binyon, who helped her edit Songs of love and death, which was published in 1926. ==Notes== ==References== * Select Poems of Manmohan Ghose (1975), edited by Lotika Ghose. * Manmohan Ghose (Modern Indo-English poet) (1990) by Lotika Ghose, Tr.

It is a mid-sized Augustan provincial temple of the Imperial cult. The Temple of Hercules Victor, in the Forum Boarium in Rome; the entablature is lost and the roof later. Roman temple of Alc√°ntara, in Spain, a tiny votive temple built with an important bridge under Trajan Temple of Augustus in Pula, Croatia, an early temple of the Imperial cult Ancient Roman temples were among the most important buildings in Roman culture, and some of the richest buildings in Roman architecture, though only a few survive in any sort of complete state. Today they remain \\"the most obvious symbol of Roman architecture\\".Summerson (1980), 25 Their construction and maintenance was a major part of ancient Roman religion, and all towns of any importance had at least one main temple, as well as smaller shrines. The main room (cella) housed the cult image of the deity to whom the temple was dedicated, and often a table for supplementary offerings or libations and a small altar for incense. Behind the cella was a room or rooms used by temple attendants for storage of equipment and offerings. The ordinary worshiper rarely entered the cella, and most public ceremonies were performed outside where the sacrificial altar was located, on the portico, with a crowd gathered in the temple precinct. The most common architectural plan had a rectangular temple raised on a high podium, with a clear front with a portico at the top of steps, and a triangular pediment above columns. The sides and rear of the building had much less architectural emphasis, and typically no entrances. There were also circular plans, generally with columns all round, and outside Italy there were many compromises with traditional local styles. The Roman form of temple developed initially from Etruscan temples, themselves influenced by the Greeks, with subsequent heavy direct influence from Greece. Public religious ceremonies of the official Roman religion took place outdoors and not within the temple building. Some ceremonies were processions that started at, visited, or ended with a temple or shrine, where a ritual object might be stored and brought out for use, or where an offering would be deposited. Sacrifices, chiefly of animals, would take place at an open-air altar within the templum; often on one of the narrow extensions of the podium to the side of the steps. Especially under the Empire, exotic foreign cults gained followers in Rome, and were the local religions in large parts of the expanded Empire. These often had very different practices, some preferring underground places of worship, while others, like Early Christians, worshiped in houses.Sear Some remains of many Roman temples still survive, above all in Rome itself, but the relatively few near-complete examples were nearly all converted into Christian churches (and sometimes subsequently to mosques), usually a considerable time after the initial triumph of Christianity under Constantine. The decline of Roman religion was relatively slow, and the temples themselves were not appropriated by the government until a decree of the Emperor Honorius in 415. Santi Cosma e Damiano, in the Roman Forum, originally the Temple of Romulus, was not dedicated as a church until 527. The best known is the Pantheon, Rome, which, however, is highly untypical, being a very large circular temple with a magnificent concrete roof, behind a conventional portico front.Wheeler, 104‚Äì106; Sear ==Terms== The English word \\"temple\\" derives from the Latin templum, which was originally not the building itself, but a sacred space surveyed and plotted ritually.Stamper, 10 The Roman architect Vitruvius always uses the word templum to refer to the sacred precinct, and not to the building. The more common Latin words for a temple or shrine were sacellum (a small shrine or chapel), aedes, delubrum, and fanum (in this article, the English word \\"temple\\" refers to any of these buildings, and the Latin templum to the sacred precinct). ==Architecture== The form of the Roman temple was mainly derived from the Etruscan model, but in the late Republic there was a switch to using Greek classical and Hellenistic styles, without much change in the key features of the form. The Etruscans were a people of northern Italy, whose civilization was at its peak in the seventh century BC. The Etruscans were already influenced by early Greek architecture, so Roman temples were distinctive but with both Etruscan and Greek features.Boardman, 255; Henig, 56 Surviving temples (both Greek and Roman) lack the extensive painted statuary that decorated the rooflines, and the elaborate revetments and antefixes, in colourful terracotta in earlier examples, that enlivened the entablature. Etruscan and Roman temples emphasised the front of the building, which followed Greek temple models and typically consisted of wide steps leading to a portico with columns, a pronaos, and usually a triangular pediment above, which was filled with statuary in the most grand examples; this was as often in terracotta as stone, and no examples have survived except as fragments. Especially in the earlier periods, further statuary might be placed on the roof, and the entablature decorated with antefixes and other elements, all of this being brightly painted. However, unlike the Greek models, which generally gave equal treatment to all sides of the temple, which could be viewed and approached from all directions, the side and rear walls of Roman temples might be largely undecorated (as in the Pantheon, Rome and Vic), inaccessible by steps (as in the Maison Carr√©e and Vic), and even back on to other buildings. As in the Maison Carr√©e, columns at the side might be half columns, emerging from (\\"engaged with\\" in architectural terminology) the wall.Wheeler, 89; Henig, 56 The platform on which the temple sat was typically raised higher in Etruscan and Roman examples than Greek, with up to ten, twelve or more steps rather than the three typical in Greek temples; the Temple of Claudius was raised twenty steps. These steps were normally only at the front, and typically not the whole width of that. It might or might not be possible to walk around the temple exterior inside (Temple of Hadrian) or outside the colonnade, or at least down the sides.Henig, 56, Wheeler, 89 The description of the Greek models used here is a generalization of classical Greek ideals, and later Hellenistic buildings often do not reflect them. For example, the \\"Temple of Dionysus\\" on the terrace by the theatre at Pergamon (Ionic, 2nd century BC, on a hillside), had many steps in front, and no columns beyond the portico.Cook, R.M., Greek Art, plate 86 and caption, Penguin, 1986 (reprint of 1972), The Parthenon, also approached up a hill, probably had many wide steps at the approach to the main front, followed by a flat area before the final few steps.16 in a reconstruction drawing by G. Stephens, p. 38 in The Acropolis: Monuments and Museum, by G. Papathanassopoulos, Krene Editions, 1977 After the eclipse of the Etruscan models, the Greek classical orders in all their details were closely followed in the fa√ßades of Roman temples, as in other prestigious buildings, with the direct adoption of Greek models apparently beginning around 200 BC, under the late Republic. But the distinctive differences in the general arrangement of temples between the Etruscan-Roman style and the Greek, as outlined above, were retained. However the idealized proportions between the different elements in the orders set out by the only significant Roman writer on architecture to survive, Vitruvius, and subsequent Italian Renaissance writers, do not reflect actual Roman practice, which could be very variable, though always aiming at balance and harmony. Following a Hellenistic trend, the Corinthian order and its variant the Composite order were most common in surviving Roman temples, but for small temples like that at Alc√°ntara, a simple Tuscan order could be used. Vitruvius does not recognise the Composite order in his writings, and covers the Tuscan order only as Etruscan; Renaissance writers formalized them from observing surviving buildings.Summerson (1980), 8‚Äì13 A Roman mammisi or chapel added to Dendera Temple, using the traditional Egyptian temple style. The front of the temple typically carried an inscription saying who had built it, cut into the stone with a \\"V\\" section. This was filled with brightly coloured paint, usually scarlet or vermilion. In major imperial monuments the letters were cast in lead and held in by pegs, then also painted or gilded. These have usually long vanished, but archaeologists can generally reconstruct them from the peg-holes, and some have been re-created and set in place.Henig, 225 There was considerable local variation in style, as Roman architects often tried to incorporate elements the population expected in its sacred architecture. This was especially the case in Egypt and the Near East, where different traditions of large stone temples were already millennia old. The Romano-Celtic temple was a simple style, usually with little use of stone, for small temples found in the Western Empire, and by far the most common type in Roman Britain, where they were usually square, with an ambulatory. It often lacked any of the distinctive classical features, and may have had considerable continuity with pre-Roman temples of the Celtic religion.Henig, 56‚Äì57; Wheeler, 100‚Äì104: Sear ==Circular plans== \\"Temple of Venus\\", Baalbek, from the rear Romano-Celtic temples were often circular, and circular temples of various kinds were built by the Romans. Greek models were available in tholos shrines and some other buildings, as assembly halls and various other functions. Temples of the goddess Vesta, which were usually small, typically had this shape, as in those at Rome and Tivoli (see list), which survive in part. Like the Temple of Hercules Victor in Rome, which was perhaps by a Greek architect, these survivors had an unbroken colonnade encircling the building, and a low, Greek- style podium.Wheeler, 100‚Äì104; Sear Different formulae were followed in the Pantheon, Rome and a small temple at Baalbek (usually called the \\"Temple of Venus\\"), where the door is behind a full portico, though very different ways of doing this are used. In the Pantheon only the portico has columns, and the \\"thoroughly uncomfortable\\" exterior meeting of the portico and circular cella are often criticised. At Baalbek, a wide portico with a broken pediment is matched by four other columns round the building, with the architrave in scooped curving sections, each ending in a projection supported by a column.Wheeler, 97‚Äì106, 105 quoted. Originally, the \\"uncomfortable\\" junction was screened by a wall and less apparent. At Praeneste (modern Palestrina) near Rome, a huge pilgrimage complex of the 1st century BC led visitors up several levels with large buildings on a steep hillside, before they eventually reached the sanctuary itself, a much smaller circular building.Boardman, 256‚Äì257 ==Caesareum== Temple of the Imperial cult at Vienne A caesareum was a temple devoted to the Imperial cult. Caesarea were located throughout the Roman Empire, and often funded by the imperial government, tending to replace state spending on new temples to other gods, and becoming the main or only large temple in new Roman towns in the provinces. This was the case at √âvora, Vienne and N√Æmes, which were all expanded by the Romans as coloniae from Celtic oppida soon after their conquest. Imperial temples paid for by the government usually used conventional Roman styles all over the empire, regardless of the local styles seen in smaller temples. In newly planned Roman cities the temple was normally centrally placed at one end of the forum, often facing the basilica at the other.Henig, 55; Sear In the city of Rome, a caesareum was located within the religious precinct of the Arval Brothers. In 1570, it was documented as still containing nine statues of Roman emperors in architectural niches.The statues are all lost, but the base for the statue of Marcus Aurelius survives, and the inscriptions of seven of the nine are recorded in volume 6 of the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum. Jane Fejfer, Roman Portraits in Context (Walter de Gruyter, 2008), p. 86. Most of the earlier emperors had their own very large temples in Rome, but a faltering economy meant that the building of new imperial temples mostly ceased after the reign of Marcus Aurelius (d. 180), though the Temple of Romulus on the Roman Forum was built and dedicated by the Emperor Maxentius to his son Valerius Romulus, who died in childhood in 309 and was deified. One of the earliest and most prominent of the caesarea was the Caesareum of Alexandria, located on the harbor. It was begun by Cleopatra VII of the Ptolemaic dynasty, the last pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, to honour her dead lover Julius Caesar, then converted by Augustus to his own cult. During the 4th century, after the Empire had come under Christian rule, it was converted to a church.David M. Gwynn, \\"Archaeology and the 'Arian Controversy' in the Fourth Century,\\" in Religious Diversity in Late Antiquity (Brill, 2010), p. 249. ==Influence== St Martin-in-the-Fields, London (1720), James Gibbs The Etruscan-Roman adaptation of the Greek temple model to place the main emphasis on the front fa√ßade and let the other sides of the building harmonize with it only as much as circumstances and budget allow has generally been adopted in Neoclassical architecture, and other classically derived styles. In these temple fronts with columns and a pediment are very common for the main entrance of grand buildings, but often flanked by large wings or set in courtyards. This flexibility has allowed the Roman temple front to be used in buildings made for a wide variety of purposes. The colonnade may no longer be pushed forward with a pronaus porch, and it may not be raised above the ground, but the essential shape remains the same. Among thousands of examples are the White House, Buckingham Palace, and St Peters, Rome; in recent years the temple front has become fashionable in China.Heathcote, Edwin, Review of Original Copies: Architectural Mimicry in Contemporary China, by Bianca Bosker, University of Hawaii Press, The Financial Times, January 25, 2013 Renaissance and later architects worked out ways of harmoniously adding high raised domes, towers and spires above a colonnaded temple portico front, something the Romans would have found odd. The Roman temple front remains a familiar feature of subsequent Early Modern architecture in the Western tradition, but although very commonly used for churches, it has lost the specific association with religion that it had for the Romans.Anthony Grafton, Glenn W Most, Salvatore Settis, eds., The Classical Tradition, 927, 2010, Harvard University Press, , 9780674035720, google books Generally, later adaptions lack the colour of the original, and though there may be sculpture filling the pediment in grand examples, the full Roman complement of sculpture above the roofline is rarely emulated. Variations on the theme, mostly Italian in origin, include: San Andrea, Mantua, 1462 by Leon Battista Alberti, which took a four-columned Roman triumphal arch and added a pediment above; San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice, begun 1566, by Andrea Palladio, which has two superimposed temple fronts, one low and wide, the other tall and narrow; the Villa Capra \\"La Rotonda\\", 1567 on, also by Palladio, with four isolated temple fronts on each side of a rectangle, with a large central dome. In Baroque architecture two temple fronts, often of different orders, superimposed one above the other, became extremely common for Catholic churches, often with the uppermost one supported by huge volutes to each side. This can be seen developing in the Ges√π, Rome (1584), Santa Susanna, Rome (1597), Santi Vincenzo e Anastasio a Trevi (1646) and Val-de-Gr√¢ce, Paris (1645 on).Summerson (1980), captions to illustrations 21, 41, 42, 72‚Äì75 The Palladian villas of the Veneto include numerous ingenious and influential variations on the theme of the Roman temple front. An archetypical pattern for churches in Georgian architecture was set by St Martin-in-the-Fields in London (1720), by James Gibbs, who boldly added to the classical temple fa√ßade at the west end a large steeple on top of a tower, set back slightly from the main frontage. This formula shocked purists and foreigners, but became accepted and was very widely copied, at home and in the colonies,Summerson (1988), 64‚Äì70 for example at St Andrew's Church, Chennai in India and St. Paul's Chapel in New York City (1766). La Madeleine, Paris (1807), now a church Examples of modern buildings that stick more faithfully to the ancient rectangular temple form are only found from the 18th century onwards. Versions of the Roman temple as a discrete block include La Madeleine, Paris (1807), now a church but built by Napoleon as a Temple de la Gloire de la Grande Arm√©e (\\"Temple to the Glory of the Great Army\\"), the Virginia State Capitol as originally built in 1785‚Äì88, and Birmingham Town Hall (1832‚Äì34).Summerson (1980), 28. The Virginia State Capitol is specifically based on the Maison carre, but in a cheaper Ionic rather than Corinthian. Small Roman circular temples with colonnades have often been used as models, either for single buildings, large or small, or elements such as domes raised on drums, in buildings on another plan such as St Peters, Rome, St Paul's Cathedral in London and the United States Capitol. The great progenitor of these is the Tempietto of Donato Bramante in the courtyard of San Pietro in Montorio in Rome, c. 1502, which has been widely admired ever since.Summerson (1980), 25, 41‚Äì42, 49‚Äì51 Though the Pantheon's large circular domed cella, with a conventional portico front, is \\"unique\\" in Roman architecture, it has been copied many times by modern architects. Versions include the church of Santa Maria Assunta in Ariccia by Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1664), which followed his work restoring the Roman original,Summerson (1980), 38‚Äì39, 38 quoted Belle Isle House (1774) in England, and Thomas Jefferson's library at the University of Virginia, The Rotunda (1817‚Äì26).Summerson (1980), 38‚Äì39 The Pantheon was much the largest and most accessible complete classical temple front known to the Italian Renaissance, and was the standard exemplar when these were revived. ==Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus== Relief of Marcus Aurelius sacrificing at the 4th temple (left) The Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill was the oldest large temple in Rome, dedicated to the Capitoline Triad consisting of Jupiter and his companion deities, Juno and Minerva, and had a cathedral-like position in the official religion of Rome. It was destroyed by fire three times, and rapidly rebuilt in contemporary styles. The first building, traditionally dedicated in 509 BC,Ab urbe condita, 2.8 has been claimed to have been almost , much larger than other Roman temples for centuries after, although its size is heavily disputed by specialists. Whatever its size, its influence on other early Roman temples was significant and long-lasting.Stamper, 33 and all Chapters 1 and 2. Stamper is a leading protagonist of a smaller size, rejecting the larger size proposed by the late Einar Gjerstad. The same may have been true for the later rebuildings, though here the influence is harder to trace. For the first temple Etruscan specialists were brought in for various aspects of the building, including making and painting the extensive terracotta elements of the entablature or upper parts, such as antefixes.Stamper, 12‚Äì13 But for the second building they were summoned from Greece. Rebuildings after destruction by fire were completed in 69 BC, 75 AD, and in the 80s AD, under Domitian ‚Äì the third building only lasted five years before burning down again. After a major sacking by Vandals in 455, and comprehensive removal of stone in the Renaissance, only foundations can now be seen, in the basement of the Capitoline Museums.Stamper, 14‚Äì15, 33 and all Chapters 1 and 2; Rykwert, Joseph, The Dancing Column: On Order in Architecture, 357‚Äì360, 1998, MIT Press, , 9780262681018, google books; Entry on \\"Aedes Iovis Optimi Maximi Capitolini\\" from A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome, by Samuel Ball Platner (as completed and revised by Thomas Ashby), Oxford University Press, 1929 The sculptor Flaminio Vacca (d 1605) claimed that the life-size Medici lion he carved to match a Roman survival, now in Florence, was made from a single capital from the temple.Stamper, 15 ==Substantial survivals== Temple of Bacchus at Baalbek, Lebanon View of the Temple of Romulus, from the Palatine Hill.

Often the porticos were walled in between the columns, and the original cella front and side walls largely removed to create a large single space in the interior. Rural areas in the Islamic world have some good remains, which had been left largely undisturbed. In Spain some remarkable discoveries (Vic, Cordoba, Barcelona) were made in the 19th century when old buildings being reconstructed or demolished were found to contain major remains encased in later buildings. In Rome, Pula, and elsewhere some walls incorporated in later buildings have always been evident. The squared-off blocks of temple walls have always been attractive for later builders to reuse, while the large pieces of massive columns were less easy to remove and make use of; hence the podium, minus facing, and some columns are often all that remain. In most cases loose pieces of stone have been removed from the site, and some such as capitals may be found in local museums, along with non-architectural items excavated, such as terracotta votive statuettes or amulets, which are often found in large numbers.Vickers, Michael, Ancient Rome, Preface, 1989, Elsevier-Phaidon; Henig, 191‚Äì199 Very little indeed survives in place from the significant quantities of large sculpture that originally decorated temples.Strong, 48 ;Rome * Pantheon or Temple to All The Gods, unique among Roman temples, but later much imitated.

He held the position of Gordon McKay Professor of Aerodynamics and Applied Mathematics at Harvard University. He described his work in his own words shortly before his death as being on :\\"... practical analysis, integral and differential equations, mechanics, hydrodynamics and aerodynamics, constructive geometry, probability calculus, statistics and philosophy.\\" Although best known for his mathematical work, Mises also contributed to the philosophy of science as a neo-positivist, following the line of Ernst Mach. Historians of the Vienna Circle of logical empiricism recognize a \\"first phase\\" from 1907 through 1914 with Philipp Frank, Hans Hahn, and Otto Neurath. His older brother, Ludwig von Mises, held an opposite point of view with respect to positivism and epistemology. During his time in Istanbul, Mises maintained close contact with Philipp Frank, a logical positivist and Professor of Physics in Prague until 1938. His literary interests included the Austrian novelist Robert Musil and the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, on whom he became a recognized expert. ==Life== Richard von Mises was born in Lemberg, Austria-Hungary (now Lviv, Ukraine) into a Jewish family, eighteen months after his brother Ludwig von Mises, who later became a prominent economist of the Austrian School. His parents were Arthur Edler von Mises, a doctor of technical sciences who worked as an expert for the Austrian State Railways, and Adele Landau. Richard and Ludwig also had a younger brother, who died as an infant. Richard attended the Akademisches Gymnasium in Vienna, from which he graduated with honors in Latin and mathematics in autumn 1901. After graduating in mathematics, physics and engineering from the Vienna University of Technology, he was appointed as Georg Hamel's assistant in Br√ºnn (now Brno). In 1905, still a student, he published an article on the geometry of curves called \\"Zur konstruktiven Infinitesimalgeometrie der ebenen Kurven,\\" in the prestigious Zeitschrift f√ºr Mathematik und Physik. crest In 1908 Mises was awarded a doctorate from Vienna (his dissertation was on \\"the determination of flywheel masses in crank drives\\") and he received his habilitation from Br√ºnn (now Brno) (on \\"Theory of the Waterwheels\\") to lecture on engineering. In 1909, at 26, he was appointed professor of applied mathematics in Stra√üburg, then part of the German Empire (now Strasbourg, Alsace, France) and received Prussian citizenship. His application for a teaching position at the Brno University of Technology was interrupted by the First World War. Before the war he had already become a pilot and lectured on the design of aircraft, and in 1913 at Strasbourg he gave the first university course on powered flight. On the outbreak of war it was natural for him to join the Austro-Hungarian army as a test pilot and a flying instructor. In 1915, he supervised the construction of a 600-horsepower (450 kW) aircraft ‚Äì the \\"Mises-Flugzeug\\" (Mises aircraft) for the Austrian army. It was completed in 1916 but never saw active war service. After the war, Mises held the new chair of hydrodynamics and aerodynamics at the Dresden Technische Hochschule. In 1919 he was appointed director (and full professor) at the new Institute of Applied Mathematics created at the behest of Erhard Schmidt at the University of Berlin. In 1921 he founded the journal Zeitschrift f√ºr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik and became its editor. With the rise of the National Socialist Party to power in 1933, Mises felt his position threatened, despite his First World War military service. He moved to Turkey, where he held the newly created chair of Pure and Applied Mathematics at the University of Istanbul. In 1939 he accepted a position in the United States, where in 1944 he was appointed as Gordon McKay Professor of Aerodynamics and Applied Mathematics at Harvard University. In 1943 he married Hilda Geiringer, a mathematician who had been his assistant at the Institute and moved with him to Turkey and then to the U.S. In 1950 Mises declined an offer of honorary membership from the Communist-dominated East German Academy of Science. ==Contributions== In aerodynamics, von Mises made notable advances in boundary-layer-flow theory and airfoil design. He developed the distortion energy theory of stress, which is one of the most important concepts used by engineers in material strength calculations. His ideas were not unanimously well received, although Alexander Ostrowski had said of him: \\"Only with the appointment of Richard von Mises to the University of Berlin did the first serious German school of applied mathematics with a broad sphere of influence come into existence. Von Mises was an incredibly dynamic person and at the same time amazingly versatile like Runge. He was especially well versed in the realm of technology.\\" and also wrote \\"Because of his dynamic personality his occasional major blunders were somehow tolerated. One has even forgiven him his theory of probability.\\" Yet Andrey Kolmogorov, whose rival axiomatisation was better received, was less severe: \\"The basis for the applicability of the results of the mathematical theory of probability to real 'random phenomena' must depend on some form of the frequency concept of probability, the unavoidable nature of which has been established by von Mises in a spirited manner.\\" In solid mechanics, von Mises made an important contribution to the theory of plasticity by formulating what has become known as the von Mises yield criterion, independently of Tytus Maksymilian Huber. He is also often credited for the Principle of Maximum Plastic Dissipation. The Gesellschaft f√ºr Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik (International Association of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics) has awarded a Richard von Mises-Preis (Prize) since 1989. In probability theory, he was the person who originally proposed the now famous \\"birthday problem\\". He also defined the impossibility of a gambling system.Probability, Statistics and Truth by Richard von Mises 1928/1981 Dover, page 25Counting for something: statistical principles and personalities by William Stanley Peters 1986 page 3 ==BibliographyBooks=== * Richard von Mises, Philipp Frank, Heinrich Weber, Bernhard Riemann, Die Differential- und Integralgleichungen der Mechanik und Physik, 1925, 1930. * Richard von Mises, Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung und ihre Anwendungen in der Statistik und theoretischen Physik, 1931. * Richard von Mises, The critical external pressure of cylindrical tubes under uniform radial and axial load, (Translation of Kritischer Au√üendruck zylindrischer Rohre, 1917), U.S. Experimental Model Basin, Navy Yard, 1933. * Richard von Mises, P.

The game is essentially an Asteroids clone with enhancements, such as power-ups, shields, a high-energy techno module soundtrack, vivid use of colors and the occasional tunnel section that revolves around a sphere. The game's graphics drew critical acclaim for the aforementioned tunnels and the liberal use of ray-tracing. The company has since merged with Terramarque to form Housemarque. In a not atypical bout of Finnish humor, the developers gave several things ludicrous names in their own language, which were (and still are) highly obscure in the international market. The damsel in distress is named after a brand of margarine, and the final confrontation takes place over the planet Imatra. ==Ports== The game was ported to MS-DOS, but not by the original programmers. This version was buggy, scant on details found in the Amiga version and severely lacking in both control and gameplay polish. Conversion made for the Atari STE by Aggression demoscene crew was published in 1995 by Daze Marketing. It is one of the few games to use the Atari STE's updated capabilities. ==Legacy== An enhanced sequel was released for AGA Amigas, Amiga CD32, and finally for the IBM PC compatible platform as well. Named Super Stardust (or Super Stardust '96), the game features a CD soundtrack from Slusnik Luna, FMV cut-scenes, high speed gameplay and completely new levels and enemies. In April 2007, Sony Computer Entertainment released Super Stardust HD as a downloadable PlayStation Network game for the PlayStation 3. In February 2012, Super Stardust Delta was released on the PlayStation Network as a downloadable title for the PlayStation Vita. ==References== == External links == * Stardust at the Housemarque website * Stardust at Atari Mania * Category:1993 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Atari ST games Category:CD32 games Category:DOS games Category:Europe-exclusive video games Category:Multidirectional shooters Category:Video games developed in Finland Category:Video game clones Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Stardust (1993 video game)"},{"id":"821605","text":"In computing, \`cut\` is a command line utility on Unix and Unix-like operating systems which is used to extract sections from each line of input ‚Äî usually from a file.

The word \\"complex\\" refers to different situations. Unlike simple harmonic motion, which is regardless of air resistance, friction, etc., complex harmonic motion often has additional forces to dissipate the initial energy and lessen the speed and amplitude of an oscillation until the energy of the system is totally drained and the system comes to rest at its equilibrium point. == Types  Damped harmonic motion ===  Introduction  Analysis of damped oscillatory forces in swimming a diagram of three types of damped harmonic motion Damped harmonic motion is a real oscillation, in which an object is hanging on a spring. Because of the existence of internal friction and air resistance, the system will over time experience a decrease in amplitude. The decrease of amplitude is due to the fact that the energy goes into thermal energy.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxDvW8_fm7I Damped harmonic motion happens because the spring is not very efficient at storing and releasing energy so that the energy dies out. The damping force is proportional to the velocity of the object and is at the opposite direction of the motion so that the object slows down quickly. Specifically, When an object is damping, the damping force F will be related to velocity v by a coefficient c:http://www.sparknotes.com/physics/oscillations/applicationsofharmonicmotion/section2.rhtmlhttp://wiki.ubc.ca/Simple_and_Damped_Harmonic_Motion#Damped_Harmonic_Motion :F=-cv. The diagram shown on the right indicates three types of damped harmonic motion. * Critically damped: The system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating. * Underdamped: The system oscillates (at reduced frequency compared to the undamped case) with the amplitude gradually decreasing to zero. * Overdamped: The system returns (exponentially decays) to equilibrium without oscillating.Damping  Difference between damped and forced oscillation  An object or a system is oscillating in its own natural frequency without the interference of an external periodic force or initial motion. Damped oscillation is similar to forced oscillation except that it has continuous and repeated force. Hence, these are two motions that have opposite results. a playground swing  Examples  # Bungee jumper provides a large force of bouncing by compressing the springs underneath it. The compression theoretically turns the kinetic energy into elastic potential energy. When the elastic potential energy reaches its top boundary, it can be exerted onto the object or child that presses on it within the form of kinetic energy.http://www.scienceclarified.com/everyday/Real-Life-Physics- Vol-2/Oscillation-Real-life-applications.html # Rubber band works the same as the spring. === Resonance === Resonant frequency amplitude  Introduction  Resonance occurs when the frequency of the external force (applied) is the same as the natural frequency (resonant frequency) of the system. When such a situation occurs, the external force always acts in the same direction as the motion of the oscillating object, with the result that the amplitude of the oscillation increases indefinitely, as it's shown in the adjacent diagram. Away from the value of resonant frequency, either greater or lesser, the amplitude of the corresponding frequency is smaller. In a set of driving pendulums with different length of strings hanging objects, the one pendulum with the same length of string as the driver gets the biggest amplitude of swinging.  Examples  * Parts of a car may vibrate if you drive over a bumpy road at a speed where the vibrations transmitted to the body are at the resonant frequency of that part (though most cars are designed with parts with natural frequencies that are not likely to be produced by driving). * Bass frequencies from stereo speakers can make a room resonate, particularly annoying if you live next door and your living room resonates due to your neighbour's music * a man walks across a field carrying a long plank on his shoulder. At each step the plank flexes a little (a) and the ends move up and down. He then starts to trot and as a result bounces up and down (b). At one particular speed resonance will occur between the motion of the man and the plank and the ends of the plank then oscillate with large amplitude.http://www.schoolphysics.co.uk/age16-19/Mechanics/Simple%20harmonic%20motion/text/Resonance_/index.html * When using a microwave oven to cook food, the micro wave travels through the food, causing the water molecules vibrate in the same frequency, which is similar to resonance, so that the food as a whole, gets hot fast. * Some of the helicopter crashes are caused by resonance too. The eyeballs of the pilot resonate because of excessive pressure in the upper air, making the pilot unable to see overhead power lines. As a result, the helicopter is out of control. * Resonance of two identical tune forks See video: http://video.mit.edu/embed/11447/ === Double pendulum ===  Introduction  double pendulum Ferdinand Berthoud marine clock No2 with motor spring and double pendulum sheel 1763 A double pendulum is a simple pendulum hanging under another one, which is an epitome of the compound pendulum system. It shows an abundant dynamic behavior. The motion of a double pendulum seems chaotic. We can hardly see a regulated routine that it is going, which makes it complicated. Also, whether the lengths and masses of the two arms are equal to each other, makes it hard to identify the centers of the two rods. Moreover, a double pendulum may exert motion without the restriction of only two-dimension (usually vertical) plane. In other words, the complex pendulum can move to anywhere within the sphere, which has the radius of the total length of the two pendulums. However, for a small angle, the double pendulum can act similar to the simple pendulum because the motion is determined by sine and cosine functions as well.http://www.myphysicslab.com/dbl_pendulum.html  Examples  The image shows a marine clock with motor springs and double pendulum sheel. ==See also== *Cymatics *Lissajous curve *Double pendulum *Resonance ==References== Category:Classical mechanics Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Complex harmonic motion"},{"id":"821624","text":"Farmers and Merchants Bank (F&M;) is a historic lending institution (1871‚àí1952) based in Downtown Los Angeles, California. It is known both for its architecture and its pivotal role in the economic development of early Los Angeles. Other, non-related \\"F&M; Banks\\" exist in many cities and towns across the United States. ==History== The Farmer's and Merchants Bank was founded in 1871 by 23 prominent Los Angeles businessmen, with an initial capital of $500,000. The three largest subscribers were financier Isaias W. Hellman ($100,000), former California Governor John G. Downey ($100,000), and Ozro W. Childs ($50,000) who in later years became the founders of the University of Southern California. Other investors included Charles Ducommun ($25,000), I.M. Hellman ($20,000), and Jose Mascarel ($10,000.). Its original location was at the Pico Building, on Main Street, between what is now US 101 and Temple, roughly at the site of the Triforium. https://www.newspapers.com/clip/59823326/pico-building-razed/ The Farmers and Merchants Bank was the first incorporated bank in Los Angeles, founded in 1871 by Isaias W. Hellman, a successful merchant, real estate investor, and banker who immigrated to Los Angeles in 1859; with John G Downey, the seventh governor of California; and Herman W. Hellman, the brother of Isaias. Downey was named the first president, with Isaias actually running the bank. Isaias served as president of the bank from 1890 until his death in 1920. I.W. Hellman, was a cautious lender, insisting that major borrowers have good character and provide good security. Its subsequent presidents, J.A. Graves (who had been Hellman's attorney) and Victor H. Rosetti, continued Hellman's conservative practices, with a large portion of the bank's capital constantly held in Treasury securities. As a result, the Bank survived every economic panic period, from the Panic of 1873, Panic of 1893, and Panic of 1896, through the Great Depression. The building at 4th and Main in 1923 However, a one-branch downtown bank was eventually seen as not likely to continue to grow. In 1956, it merged with Security First National Bank, which became in later years Security Pacific National Bank, and ultimately was acquired by the Bank of America. The location of the bank prior to 1905 was on the southeast corner of Main and Commercial streets.Sanborn's Fire Map of Los Angeles, 1896, sheet 14 ==Architecture== Designed in the Classical Revival style, the 1905 Farmers and Merchants Bank remains one of Southern California's finest examples of the early \\"temples of finance\\" which were popular at the turn of the century. Its two-story facade, reminiscent of a Roman temple, is punctuated by an entrance framed with Corinthian columns topped by a large triangular pediment. Built in 1905, the bank was designed by the firm of Morgan and Walls. ==Present-day== The Farmers & Merchants Bank building has been established as Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument #271. The facade of the building at night in 2014 Much of the original banking room remains, including light fixtures, a central skylight, and the loggia with its Victorian-style railings. Operating as a bank until its closure in the late 80s, the building now functions primarily as a special events and banquet facility and film location. The building is slated for renovation by developer Tom Gilmore and Associates. ==See also== * * Yule marble ==Notes== ==References== *Isaias W.

Amestoy started a modest sheep business and within a few years he parlayed it into a fortune. He was one of the largest wool producers in Southern California during the 1860s. In 1871, he bought $500,000 worth of shares in the newly established Farmers and Merchants Bank in Los Angeles. In 1874 he went back to France and married. In 1875 Amestoy moved his family to of the \\"Rosecrans Rancho\\" in what is now Gardena. By 1880, he had over 30,000 head of sheep, most of which were fine- wooled Spanish merinos. In 1889 he acquired all of Rancho Los Encinos in the San Fernando Valley. After Domingo Amestoy died on January 11, 1892, his sons, John and Peter Amestoy, assumed ranch operations and changed the name to Amestoy ranch. Like other ranches in the San Fernando Valley at the time, the Amestoys cultivated wheat and barley. The Amestoy family held title to rancho for fifty-five years. In 1915, subdivision of the rancho began later developing into the communities of Sherman Oaks and Encino.

Youth are trained in conducting night schools, laying the roads, educating slum dwellers, service to the handicapped, tree plantation, and health programmes. ==Academics== The college runs eleven graduate and seven postgraduate programmes in the day college and eight graduate and two postgraduate programmes in the evening college. Undergraduate degrees include B.Com, B.A. and BSc degrees as well as B.B.A. and B.C.A. in the evening college. Postgraduate degrees award M.A. and M.SC., and in addition M.S.W. in the evening college. There are research degrees awarding M.Phil or PhD ===Scientific research=== The departments of botany, chemistry, physics, mathematics, economics, philosophy and Sanskrit offer research programmes. The Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith has two research institutes: Vivekananda Institute of Tropical Mycology (VINSTROM) and Vivekananda Institute of Algal Technology (VIAT). They have originated from the department of botany. ===Vivekananda Institute of Tropical Mycology (VINSTROM)=== Mycological research in the Department of Plant Biology and Plant Biotechnology dates back to 1980s. Sustained research by Dr. T. S. Suryanarayanan for over 35 years in experimental mycology, environmental mycology, marine mycology and endophyte ecology and physiology brought international recognition to the college in general and the mycology research team in particular. As a mark of appreciation and encouragement, Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith, under the secretaryship of Swami Satyapriyananda, created a separate institute ‚Äì Vivekananda Institute of Tropical Mycology (VINSTROM) ‚Äî in 2005 to continue the research in mycology under the directorship of Dr. T. S. Suryanarayanan. VINSTROM focuses its efforts on understanding the biodiversity and technological potential of microfungi in forests and other environments. Articles are published in international magazines. ===Vivekananda Institute of Algal Technology (VIAT)=== VIAT was inaugurated by Swami Satyapriyananda, secretary of Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith, in April 2006. Based on the success of this new technology, industries such as Wheels India are seeking solutions for effective effluent treatment through phycoremediation. Sivasubramanian has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Chennai-based Indo-Japan joint venture company M/s Nichi-In Biosciences for a research project with emphasis on microbial biotechnology and environment safety to develop technology for environment-friendly plastic materials, to find ways to safely dispose the plastic materials using microbes and develop and validate polymers useful for water conservation in agriculture and horticulture. This project is supported by Japanese institutes like Waseda University, Yamanashi Medical University and Mebiol Inc., whose Indian operation is headed by Dr. Samuel J. K. Abraham, a cardiac surgeon. Prof. Mori Yuichi of Waseda University, Japan, and Dr. Yoshioka Hiroshi of Mebiol Inc., are participating in this collaboration. ===Mathematics=== Areas of research in the department are number theory, applied statistics, representation theory, algebra, functional analysis, topology algebraic geometry and Fluid dynamics. The department conducts monthly seminars and colloquiums and hosts a yearly international conference in a particular area of mathematics. It has funding and support from the UGC, National Board for Higher Mathematics, Department of Atomic Energy, Govt. of India and Govt. of Tamil Nadu. About 30 international papers are submitted from the mathematics department of Vivekananda college. ==Events== The college Silver Jubilee was celebrated in 1971, the Jubilee in 1996, and the Diamond Jubilee from January 2006 to January 2007. As a part of its Diamond Jubilee celebrations, the Vidyapith organized the two-day exhibition Enrich-2006 on 6 and 7 October. It highlighted the activities of the centres of Ramakrishna Sangha, the teachings of Sri Ramakrishna, Holy Mother and Swami Vivekananda, and the recent developments in science, commerce, and humanities.

Purohit was born in Badnera, Vidarbha, India to a wealthy Maharashtran Brahmin family. His parents gave him the name Shankar Gajannan Purohit. As a child he became proficient in Marathi, English, and Sanskrit. He was well educated, obtaining a B.A. in philosophy at Calcutta University in 1903 and a law degree from Deccan College and Bombay University. As a teenager, he decided to be celibate (as a Brahmacharya), but in 1908 he accommodated his parents' wishes and married Godu Bai. After the birth of daughters in 1910 and 1914 and a son in 1915, he resumed his vow of celibacy. A year or two before his marriage, he met a young man only four years older than himself named Natekar. Purohit says this meeting \\"was love at first sight,\\" and Natekar, who later took the monastic name Bhagwan Shri Hamsa, became Purohit's guru. In 1923 his guru directed him to embark on a mendicant pilgrimage the length and breadth of India. Begging bowl in hand, he passed several years in this way. He travelled to Europe on an extended visit in 1930. Purohit is known in the West principally for his work on translations of major Hindu texts, and his The Autobiography of an Indian Monk: His Life And His Adventures (1932) written with an accompanying introduction by the Irish poet William Butler Yeats, who has befriended and collaborated with him from then on, until Yeats's death . Subsequently, in 1934 he was mentioned in Bhagwan Shri Hamsa's book The Holy Mountain, supplemented with an introduction by Yeats. He worked with W. B. Yeats during 1935 and 1936, in Majorca, on the translations to The Ten Principal Upanishads (1938, Faber and Faber). Another book, which have been written as a result of the joint collaboration between W.B Yeats and Shri Purohit Swami, is the Swami's own version to Patanjali's Aphorisms of Yoga, published also in 1938, with a handful of illustrated Yoga exercises and postures, as an appendix to the theoretical and spiritual principles of Yoga teachings, which by convention, constitute the majority of the book pages. Yeats included him as a respectful gesture, in the Oxford Book of Modern Verse 1892‚Äì1935. He translated the Bhagavad Gita into English, and this translation can be viewed here. Unlike most translations, Shri Purohit Swami's translates every word into English and avoids the use of Sanskrit concepts that may be unfamiliar to English-speakers, for example translating the word 'yoga' as 'spirituality'. He also avoids mentioning the Caste system; where the original Gita mentions the different castes he interprets this as different occupations within society. He represents a very important but largely unremembered link between the generation of Swami Vivekananda and the Post World War II society in which eastern thought has become an accepted element of spiritual life.

Rambouillet lies on the edge of the vast Forest of Rambouillet (For√™t de Rambouillet or For√™t de l'Yveline), and is famous for its historical castle, the Ch√¢teau de Rambouillet, which hosted several international summits. Due to its proximity to Paris and Versailles, Rambouillet has long been an occasional seat of government. ==Transport== Rambouillet is served by the SNCF Rambouillet railway station on the Transilien Paris - Montparnasse suburban rail line to Chartres. ==Features== *The Ch√¢teau de Rambouillet, a former medieval fortress, was acquired by Louis XVI of France in 1783 as a private residence because of its ideal situation in the game-rich forest of Rambouillet. It became a bien national during the French Revolution of 1789, and one of the imperial residences of Napol√©on I during the First French Empire. At the time of the Bourbon Restoration, the castle became royal residence, and it is there that Charles X signed his abdication on 2 August 1830. Sometimes neglected at times of political unrest, the ch√¢teau de Rambouillet became the official summer residence of the French President of the Republic after President F√©lix Faure chose it as summer residence for himself and his family in 1896; Rambouillet thus became the official summer residence of the Presidents of the Third Republic and has retained its position ever since.G.

He was born at Milford Heath House in Surrey and died at Treliske in Truro. A determined batsman and handy medium pace bowler, Wyatt made his first-class cricket debut in 1923. He played his first Test match against South Africa in Johannesburg in 1927. He was controversially, by replacing Percy Chapman, appointed captain for England's last Test against the dominant Australian touring team in 1930. He was unsuccessful and lost the role to Douglas Jardine for the next few years. Nevertheless, he was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1930. Serving as Jardine's vice-captain on the 1932‚Äì1933 tour of Australia, Wyatt was in charge of an early tour match that Jardine sat out of, and became the first captain to employ the controversial Bodyline tactic against Australia. After Jardine resigned following the political and administrative fallout caused by Bodyline, Wyatt was made captain again. He played in 40 test matches, fifteen as captain. He is said to have captained \\"soundly if without inspiration\\". Wyatt was noted for sustaining several injuries during his career but he had a \\"bulldog spirit\\". Most famously, a ball bowled by West Indian bowler Manny Martindale hit him in the jaw during a match in Jamaica in 1935. He was carried unconscious from the field with his jaw broken in four places. When he regained consciousness in the dressing room, his first action was to signal for a pencil and paper ‚Äì when these were supplied he wrote that he attached no blame to Martindale and amended his team's batting order. Wyatt played his last Test against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1937. In his test career, he scored 1,839 runs at an average of 31.70 and took 18 wickets at an average of 35.66. In his first-class career he played 739 matches, scoring 39,405 runs at an average of 40.04, and taking 901 wickets at an average of 32.84. His highest innings in a test match was 149 against South Africa at Trent Bridge in 1935. He captained Warwickshire from 1930 to 1937 when he was replaced by Peter Cranmer. Wyatt didn't like the way this was done but he continued to play for Warwickshire through the 1938 and 1939 seasons. He served in the Royal Air Force in World War II. After the war, he transferred to Worcestershire where he said he had six happy summers. In his penultimate match in 1951, he faced the final ball of the game against Somerset at Taunton with Worcestershire needing six to win and \\"he duly drove it high into the pavilion for victory\\".Smith, Martin ed. (2013) The Promise of Endless Summer (Cricket Lives from the Daily Telegraph). Aurum. pp. 10‚Äì12. . He lived to be 93 years old and was England's oldest living Test cricketer before his death. He has a stand named after him at Warwickshire's home ground of Edgbaston. He was the cousin of politician and broadcaster Woodrow Wyatt. ==ReferencesCategory:1901 births Category:1995 deaths Category:England Test cricketers Category:England Test cricket captains Category:English cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1919 to 1945 Category:People from Surrey Category:Warwickshire cricketers Category:Warwickshire cricket captains Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricket captains Category:Free Foresters cricketers Category:Royal Air Force cricketers Category:People educated at King Henry VIII School, Coventry Category:England cricket team selectors Category:Gentlemen cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:Gentlemen of England cricketers Category:D.

Admission to Cap and Skull is dependent on excellence in academics, athletics, the arts, and public service. Leadership as well as character are also considered crucial factors for membership. Using these criteria, only 18 new members, or less than one-half of one percent of a Rutgers College class, are selected each year. ==History== On January 18, 1900, 10 members of the Senior Class of Rutgers College assembled in the Chi Psi Lodge on College Avenue and began to define what would become the greatest honor that a Rutgers student could aspire to. Drawing inspiration from Skull and Bones and Quill and Dagger, Yale and Cornell's Senior Class Honor Society, Cap and Skull sought to identify and bring together the top leaders of the Rutgers College senior class. That night, the 10 founders drew up a Cap and Skull constitution and adopted a code of secrecy and the motto, Spectemur agendo, let us be judged by our actions; for it was a student‚Äôs deeds and leadership that afforded him to be selected for Cap and Skull. To ensure that the group would remain highly selective, selection of a new member required a unanimous vote of the current members and, as a result, over the first two decades of the Society, few students ‚Äì no more than eight men in any of these years ‚Äì became Cap and Skull members. ==First World War== The 1920s found the College recovering from the First World War, and the Skulls began to reexamine their selection criteria to increase membership. Under the new system, each leadership position and honor on campus was awarded a points value, and students with the highest cumulative value were selected for induction into Cap and Skull. In 1923, in response to the growing student body, the number of members to be tapped each year was fixed at 12 and a tri-fold criteria for selection was established, still in use today: first ‚Äì activities, athletic and campus; second ‚Äì scholarship, and third ‚Äì character and service to Rutgers. The Society's skull-emblazoned caps were first donned in 1924, and are still worn today, in honor of Cap and Skull's history, spirit, and tradition. ==Second World War== With the onset of World War II, many of the best and brightest members of the Rutgers community put aside college careers and activities to serve in the military. Only ten members were selected in 1944, and no one was tapped in 1945. Many would be drafted before they could graduate. In October 1945, members of the administration who were also Cap and Skull members were asked to make nominations for the Class of 1946. Though the Society had taken a brief hiatus, the student body had not forgotten the honor of induction into the group: upon reporting the December tapping of four new members, The Daily Targum noted, \\"Election to Cap and Skull is the highest honorary distinction a Rutgers undergraduate can achieve.\\" Cap and Skull resumed the traditional 12-member selection in 1948. Many of these WWII veterans, who had seen active duty, believed this to be the apex of their college careers. In the years following the war, the prestige of being tapped for Cap and Skull increased; a growing student body and a fixed selection number of 12 meant that a smaller and smaller percentage of the class received the honor. ==50 years== On January 31, 1950, an all-day gala celebration was held in honor of Cap and Skull‚Äôs Golden Anniversary ‚Äì the first of the 10-year reunions that are still held today. The Golden Anniversary celebrated the 440 men selected as members of the Society during those first 50 years. ==Demise and rebirth== Through the 1960s, sweeping social changes occurred. Organizations such as Cap and Skull, by nature selective, and thus ultimately exclusive to most, came under scrutiny. In 1969, Cap and Skull graduated its last class; a victim of the era. Though Cap and Skull ended in 1969, the alumni of Cap and Skull retained their close ties and the underlying need for the organization remained, even during the dormant years. During 1981, Rutgers College students again discussed the need for an organization or honor that would recognize leadership contributions made by members of the senior class. Although there were honors for athletics and academics, the efforts of others were going largely unrecognized. Dean Howard Crosby, a Cap and Skull member who had remained with the University almost continuously since his graduation forty years earlier, described what he knew the solution to be. Thus, Cap and Skull re-emerged in 1982, and a reunion was held to celebrate the tapping of new members and the Society's rebirth. ==Current status== Today, Cap and Skull represents many of the diverse organizations on campus and is now composed of undergraduate students from any of the Universities reorganized schools. Formerly only members of Rutgers College (which had become co-educational in 1972) and Rutgers College affiliates from the School of Pharmacy, Engineering, and Mason Gross School of the Arts were tapped. In November 1990, the Cap and Skull Room, located in the Rutgers College Student Center, was formally dedicated, solidifying Cap and Skull's physical presence on campus. The exquisitely appointed room features old photographs and several display cases filled with Cap and Skull memorabilia. Student organizations using the room for their meetings are inspired by its contents and reflect on the rich tradition of Rutgers College, and Cap and Skull. ==Centennial 2000== In 2000, the 100th anniversary of Cap and Skull, a large gala event was held and members donated a large endowment for an annual scholarship to Rutgers students. Also in connection with the centennial, a web site was launched and author William B. Brahms, a society member compiled a detailed history with full biographies of all inducted members of the first 100 years. It was privately printed by the Society, but is available at the Rutgers University Special Collections and Archives.

A: cooling gas tangential flow to the outer quartz tube B: discharge gas flow (usually Ar) C: flow of carrier gas with sample D: induction coil which forms the strong magnetic field inside the torch E: force vectors of the magnetic field F: the plasma torch (the discharge). There are three types of ICP geometries: planar (Fig. 3 (a)), cylindrical (Fig. 3 (b)), and half-toroidal (Fig. 3 (c)). Fig. 3. Conventional Plasma Inductors In planar geometry, the electrode is a length of flat metal wound like a spiral (or coil). In cylindrical geometry, it is like a helical spring. In half- toroidal geometry, it is toroidal solenoid cut along its main diameter to two equal halves. When a time-varying electric current is passed through the coil, it creates a time-varying magnetic field around it, with flux \\\\Phi=\\\\pi r^2 H=\\\\pi r^2 H_0 \\\\cos \\\\omega t, where r is the distance to the center of coil (and of the quartz tube). According to the Faraday‚ÄìLenz's law of induction, this creates azimuthal electromotive force in the rarefied gas: U=-\\\\frac{d \\\\Phi}{dt}, which corresponds to electric field strengths of E=\\\\frac{U}{2 \\\\pi r}=\\\\frac{\\\\omega r H_0}{2} \\\\sin \\\\omega t, leading to the formation of the figure-8 electron trajectories providing a plasma generation. The dependence on r suggests that the gas ion motion is most intense in the outer region of the flame, where the temperature is the greatest. In the real torch, the flame is cooled from the outside by the cooling gas, so the hottest outer part is at thermal equilibrium. There temperature reaches 5 000‚Äì6 000 K. For more rigorous description, see Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation in electromagnetic fields. The frequency of alternating current used in the RLC circuit which contains the coil usually 27‚Äì41 MHz. To induce plasma, a spark is produced at the electrodes at the gas outlet. Argon is one example of a commonly used rarefied gas. The high temperature of the plasma allows the determination of many elements, and in addition, for about 60 elements degree of ionization in the torch exceeds 90%. The ICP torch consumes ca. 1250‚Äì1550 W of power, but this depends on the elemental composition of the sample (due to different ionization energies). == Applications == Plasma electron temperatures can range between ~6,000 K and ~10,000 K (~6 eV - ~100 eV), and are usually several orders of magnitude greater than the temperature of the neutral species. Argon ICP plasma discharge temperatures are typically ~5,500 to 6,500 K and are therefore comparable to that reached at the surface (photosphere) of the sun (~4,500 K to ~6,000 K). ICP discharges are of relatively high electron density, on the order of 1015 cm‚àí3. As a result, ICP discharges have wide applications where a high-density plasma (HDP) is needed. * ICP-AES, a type of atomic emission spectroscopy. * ICP-MS, a type of mass spectrometry. * ICP- RIE, a type of reactive-ion etching. Another benefit of ICP discharges is that they are relatively free of contamination, because the electrodes are completely outside the reaction chamber. By contrast, in a capacitively coupled plasma (CCP), the electrodes are often placed inside the reactor and are thus exposed to the plasma and subsequent reactive chemical species. ==See also== *Pulsed inductive thruster *Induction plasma technology *List of plasma physics articles *Capacitively coupled plasma == References == Category:Electrodynamics Category:Spectroscopy Category:Ion source Category:Plasma physics ","title":"Inductively coupled plasma"},{"id":"821878","text":"Bold Venture was a syndicated radio series starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall that aired from 1951 to 1952. Morton Fine and David Friedkin scripted the taped series for Bogart's Santana Productions. ==Synopsis== Salty seadog Slate Shannon (Bogart) owns a Cuban hotel, Shannon's Place, sheltering an assortment of treasure hunters, revolutionaries and other shady characters. With his sidekick and ward, the sultry Sailor Duval (Bacall), tagging along, he encounters modern-day pirates and other tough situations while navigating the waters around Havana. Aboard his boat, the Bold Venture, Slate and Sailor experience \\"adventure, intrigue, mystery and romance in the sultry settings of tropical Havana and the mysterious islands of the Caribbean.\\" Calypso singer King Moses (Jester Hairston) provided musical bridges by threading plot situations into the lyrics of his songs.Erickson, Hal (1989). Syndicated Television: The First Forty Years, 1947-1987. McFarland & Company, Inc. . Pp. 20-21. Music for the series was by David Rose. The series combined elements of a number of past Bogart/Bacall film collaborations, most notably To Have and Have Not which also cast Bogart as a boat owner in the Caribbean who reluctantly becomes involved in intrigue while romancing Bacall. The relationship between Shannon and King Moses, and his ownership of an inn, is strongly reminiscent of the dynamic between Rick Blaine and Sam in Casablanca. ==Production== Beginning in March 1951, the Frederic W. Ziv Company syndicated 78 episodes via electrical transcription. Some sources have claimed that the 78 episodes include reruns, and that there were only around 30 episodes but more than 50 shows have now come to light. Heard on 423 stations, the 30-minute series earned $5,000 weekly for Bogart and Bacall. 57 episodes are now known to exist, some are known by more than one title which can make it appear that there are more. ==Radio episode guide== *12 Year Promise (a.k.a.

Born in √Ågreda, Spain, Cacho had an enviable competitive record in the 1500 m, but it wasn't until late in his career that he produced a time of corresponding quality. Cacho's first notable result came in 1990, when he finished second in the 1500 m at the European Indoor Championships in Glasgow. At the 1991 World Indoor Championships in Seville, Cacho finished again second in the 1500 m, behind Noureddine Morceli. At the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Cacho was not considered a serious gold medal threat. But the Olympic 1500 m final was run at a very pedestrian pace, and Cacho positioned himself perfectly in the final lap, and outsprinted his rivals, with an unprecedented last lap of 50.6 seconds, to win the gold medal in 3:40.12. In 1993 at Stuttgart in World Championships, Cacho finished second, but took the 1500 m title at the European Championships in Helsinki in the next year. In World Championships at Gothenburg, Cacho only finished in eighth place. After a relatively lean year in 1995, Cacho was back to his best in the early part of the 1996 season, leading up to the Olympic Games in Atlanta. Although Cacho was the defending Olympic 1500 m champion, the final in Atlanta was considered to be a match race between Morceli and Hicham El Guerrouj, who had filled the first two places at the previous year's World Championships. Approaching the completion of the third lap, Morceli was leading from El Guerrouj, when suddenly the Moroccan tripped and fell. In taking evasive action, Cacho was forced to leap over the fallen El Guerrouj, in a manoeuvre which he later estimated had lost him 5 metres of ground to Morceli, who had commenced his final lap sprint for the finish. Cacho chased Morceli around the last lap, but was unable to catch him. In the end Morceli won by 5 metres from the second- placed Cacho. At the World Championships in Athens in 1997, Cacho won a silver medal again, and at the end of the same season he finally managed to run his world class time, when he finished second at the 1500 m behind El Guerrouj with a time of 3:28.95, which moved him to third on the all-time world list behind Morceli and El Guerrouj. He won the bronze medal at the 1998 European Championships in Budapest, and finished fourth in the World Championships at Seville in 1999. Cacho suffered an Achilles' tendon injury in 2000, causing him to miss the opportunity to add to his Olympic gold and silver medals at 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. He held the European record at 1500 m with a time of 3:28.95 for 16 years (1997‚Äì2013), until Mo Farah broke it with a time of 3:28.81. ==International competitions== { - !colspan=\\"6\\"Representing - 1987 European Junior Championships Birmingham, United Kingdom 12th 1500 m 4:00.58 - 1988 World Junior Championships Sudbury, Canada bgcolor=cc99663rd 1500 m 3:47.31 - 1989 World Cup Barcelona, Spain 6th 1500 m 3:40.34 - rowspan=21990 European Indoor Championships Glasgow, United Kingdom bgcolor=silver2nd 1500 m 3:44.61 - European Championships Split, Yugoslavia 11th 1500 m 3:42.21 - rowspan=21991 World Indoor Championships Seville, Spain bgcolor=silver2nd 1500 m 3:42.68 - World Championships Tokyo, Japan 5th 1500 m 3:35.62 - rowspan=21992 Olympic Games Barcelona, Spain bgcolor=gold1st 1500 m 3:40.12 - World Cup Havana, Cuba 4th 1500 m 3:42.781 - rowspan=21993 Mediterranean Games Narbonne, France bgcolor=silver2nd 1500 m 3:32.43 - World Championships Stuttgart, Germany bgcolor=silver2nd 1500 m 3:35.56 - 1994 European Championships Helsinki, Finland bgcolor=gold1st 1500 m 3:35.27 - rowspan=21995 World Indoor Championships Barcelona, Spain 6th 1500 m 3:45.46 - World Championships Gothenburg, Sweden 8th 1500 m 3:37.02 - 1996 Olympic Games Atlanta, United States bgcolor=silver2nd 1500 m 3:36.40 - 1997 World Championships Athens, Greece bgcolor=silver2nd 1500 m 3:36.63 - 1998 European Championships Budapest, Hungary bgcolor=cc99663rd 1500 m 3:42.13 - 1999 World Championships Seville, Spain 4th 1500 m 3:31.34 } 1Representing Europe ==Personal bests== Outdoor *800 metres ‚Äì 1:45.37 (Albacete 1991) *1000 metres ‚Äì 2:16.13 (And√∫jar 1993) *1500 metres ‚Äì 3:28.95 (Z√ºrich 1997) *One mile ‚Äì 3:49.56 (Oslo 1996) *3000 metres ‚Äì 7:37.02 (Seville 1999) *5000 metres ‚Äì 13:46.65 (Seville 2002) Indoor *800 metres ‚Äì 1:46.79 (Seville 1993) *1000 metres ‚Äì 2:20.18 (Madrid 1992) *1500 metres ‚Äì 3:35.29 (Seville 1991) *3000 metres ‚Äì 7:36.61 (Stuttgart 1996) ==References== * Spanish Olympic Committee * * *All-Athletics profile Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:People from the Province of Soria Category:Spanish male middle- distance runners Category:Olympic athletes of Spain Category:Olympic gold medalists for Spain Category:Olympic silver medalists for Spain Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:World Athletics Championships athletes for Spain Category:World Athletics Championships medalists Category:European Athletics Championships medalists Category:Medalists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Olympic silver medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Mediterranean Games silver medalists for Spain Category:Mediterranean Games medalists in athletics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1993 Mediterranean Games ","title":"Ferm√≠n Cacho"},{"id":"821893","text":"Arthur Shearly Cripps (10 June 1869 - 1 August 1952) was an English Anglican priest, missionary, activist, short story writer, and poet who spent most of his life in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe).Douglas V. Steere, God's irregular: Arthur Shearly Cripps, SPCK , London, 1973. SBN: 281 02675 0 ==Biography== Cripps was born in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, and was educated at Charterhouse School and Trinity College, Oxford, where he read history. He then trained for the Anglican priesthood at Cuddesdon Theological College, coming under the influence of Charles Gore. From 1894 he held the parish Ford End in Essex. A friend of Frank Weston, the leading Anglo Catholic priest who would become Bishop of Zanzibar he became a missionary for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, intending to work in Mashonaland, after reading criticism of the methods of Cecil Rhodes. From 1902 he had a parish near Enkeldoorn (now known as Chivhu) in what was then Southern Rhodesia. He was in conflict with the British South Africa Company over land distribution, taking the side of the African population. He was given the Shona name Mpandi, or 'the man who walks like thunder'. After more than 20 years he returned to England for a time after a quarrel with the British administration; but went back shortly afterwards for the rest of his life, having in 1927 published Africa for Africans, on the land issue. Arthur Cripps lived for some time in Manyene Communal Lands, about 120 km South of Harare, 20 km North of Chivhu. An area of Manyene is now known by the name he gave it when he established the mission work there, Maronda Mashanu, which means \\"The Five Wounds\\" in the local Shona language. Father Cripps was buried in the chancel of the church (now a ruin) at Maronda Mashanu. Some people from the area believe that Arthur Cripps performed miracles. For example, there are claims that a white man who wanted to assault him for associating with Africans was crippled the moment he raised his hand. They claim that the man was only healed when Father Cripps prayed for him. His great-great-nephew is the Welsh poet, Owen Sheers, who has written about him in the award-winning Dust Diaries (2004). ==Legacy== In his research on his great-great-uncle, Owen Sheers attended the annual memorial service at Cripps' grave. > ‚ÄúThere were huge crowds of people dancing around the grave,‚Äù said Sheers. > ‚ÄúIt was fascinating that a missionary priest who had gone out there at the > turn of the century in a period when the British were more or less the bad > guys was still being honoured almost 50 years after his death.\\"‚ÄùAnswers To A > Mystery Deep In The African Bush There is also a road in Harare, Cripps Road, which some say is named after Arthur Cripps, although Owen Sheers' book indicates the naming was for another dignitary of the same name. The road leading from Chivhu to Cripps' former mission base is however named Cripps Road in his memory. ==Works== *Some Essex Verses (1930) *Titania and Other Poems (1900) *Primavera: Poems by Four Authors (1900) *Jonathan: A Song of David (1902) *The Black Christ (1902) poems *Magic Casements (1905) *Lyra Evangelistica: Missionary Verses of Mashonaland (1909) *Faerylands Forlorn: African Tales (1910) *The Two of Them Together: A Tale About Africa To-Day (1910) *The Brooding Earth (1911) novel *Pilgrimage of Grace, Verses on a Mission (1912) *Bay-Tree Country (1913) novel *Pilgrim's Joy Verses (1916) *Lake and War: African Land and Water Verses (1917) *Cinderella in the South: South African Tales (1918) *An Africa for Africans: A Plea on Behalf of Territorial Segregation Areas and Their Freedom in a Southern African Colony (1927) *Africa: Verses (1939) ==References== Arthur Shearly Cripps (1975), John Robert Doyle, Boston, Twayne. ==External links== * * *The Dictionary of African Christian Biography on Arthur Cripps (based on Steere)1 Category:1869 births Category:1952 deaths Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Oxford Category:20th-century English Anglican priests Category:People educated at Charterhouse School Category:Anglican poets Category:People from Royal Tunbridge Wells Category:Anglican missionaries in Zimbabwe Category:English Anglican missionaries Category:English human rights activists Category:English male poets ","title":"Arthur Shearly Cripps"},{"id":"821897","text":"The Oski Yell is the University of California Berkeley spirit yell from which Cal's mascot, Oski the Bear, derives his name.

It is called marc in both English and French, but \\"grappa\\" in Italian. In Spanish it is called orujo. Alcohol derived from pomace is also used as the traditional base spirit of other liquors, such as some anise-flavored spirits. Unlike wine brandy, most pomace brandies are neither aged nor coloured. ==Production== Red grape pomace in a vineyard White grape pomace being removed from a basket press Pomace may be either fermented, semi-fermented, or unfermented. During red wine vinification, the pomace is left to soak in the must for the entire fermentation period and is thus fermented; fermented pomace is particularly suitable for the production of pomace brandy, as it is soft, dry, and has a high alcohol content. Semi-fermented pomace is produced during ros√© wine vinification; the pomace is removed before fermentation is complete. Virgin pomace, which is produced during white wine vinification, is not fermented at all.

D'Orbigny was born in Cou√´ron (Loire-Atlantique), the son of a ship's physician and amateur naturalist. The family moved to La Rochelle in 1820, where his interest in natural history was developed while studying the marine fauna and especially the microscopic creatures that he named \\"foraminiferans\\". In Paris he became a disciple of the geologist Pierre Louis Antoine Cordier (1777‚Äì1861) and Georges Cuvier. All his life, he would follow the theory of Cuvier and stay opposed to Lamarckism. ==South American era== D'Orbigny travelled on a mission for the Paris Museum, in South America between 1826 and 1833. He visited Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil, and returned to France with an enormous collection of more than 10,000 natural history specimens. He described part of his findings in La Relation du Voyage dans l'Am√©rique M√©ridionale pendant les ann√©s 1826 √† 1833 (Paris, 1824‚Äì47, in 90 fascicles). The other specimens were described by zoologists at the museum. His contemporary, Charles Darwin, arrived in South America in 1832, and on hearing that he had been preceded, grumbled that D'Orbigny had probably collected \\"the cream of all the good things\\". Darwin later called D'Orbigny's Voyage a \\"most important work\\". They went on to correspond, with D'Orbigny describing some of Darwin's specimens. He was awarded the Gold Medal of the Soci√©t√© de G√©ographie of Paris in 1834. The South American Paleocene pantodont Alcidedorbignya was named in his honour. ==1840 and later== On the shore of Rio Magdalen. Image from Voyages pittoresque dans les deux Am√©riques In 1840, d'Orbigny started the methodical description of French fossils and published La Pal√©ontologie Fran√ßaise (8 vols). In 1849 he published a closely related Prodrome de Pal√©ontologie Stratigraphique, intended as a \\"Preface to Stratigraphic Palaeontology\\", in which he described almost 18,000 species, and with biostratigraphical comparisons erected geological stages, the definitions of which rest on their stratotypes. In 1853 he became professor of palaeontology at the Paris Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle, publishing his Cours √©l√©mentaire that related paleontology to zoology, as a science independent of the uses made of it in stratigraphy.\\"Conception et suites de la Pal√©ontologie fran√ßaise d'Alcide d'Orbigny\\", Comptes Rendus Paleologiques 1.7 (December 2002) pp. 599‚Äì613. The chair of paleontology was created especially in his honor. The d'Orbigny collection is housed in the Salle d'Orbigny and is often visited by experts.Agn√®s Lauriat-Rag, \\"La collection d'Invert√©br√©s fossiles d'Alcide d'Orbigny et la salle d'Orbigny\\", Comptes Rendus Paleologiques 1.7 (December 2002) pp. 615‚Äì627. He described the geological timescales and defined numerous geological strata, still used today as chronostratigraphic reference such as Toarcian, Callovian, Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, Aptian, Albian and Cenomanian. He died in the small town of Pierrefitte-sur-Seine, near Paris. ==Catastrophism== D'Orbigny, a disciple of Georges Cuvier, was a notable advocate of catastrophism.Huggett, Richard J. (1998). Catastrophism: Asteroids, Comets and Other Dynamic Events in Earth History. Verso. p. 95. He recognized twenty-seven catastrophes in the fossil record.Singer, Charles Joseph. (1931). The Story of Living Things: A Short Account of the Evolution of the Biological Sciences. Harper & Bros. p. 232 This became known as the \\"doctrine of successive creations\\".Prothero, Donald R. (2013). Bringing Fossils to Life: An Introduction to Paleobiology. Columbia University Press. p. 223. He attempted to reconcile the fossil record with the Genesis creation narrative. Both uniformitarian geologists and theologians rejected his idea of successive creations. Palaeontologist Carroll Lane Fenton has noted that his idea of twenty-seven world-wide creations was \\"absurd\\", even for creationists.Fenton, Carroll Lane. (1933). The World Of Fossils. D. Appleton- Century Company. p. 162 L. Sprague de Camp has written that \\"Alcide d'Orbigny, carried the idea to absurdity. Dragging in the supernatural, d'Orbigny argued that, on twenty-seven separate occasions, God had wiped out all life on earth and started over with a whole new creation.\\"De Camp, Lyon Sprague.

However, it does not mean to have sex with in the same way that fuck does, and those aware of this use consider it a lesser expletive than 'fuck'. * Verb meaning 'to steal' (e.g., 'They had fecked cash out of the rector's room.'Portrait of the Artist, James Joyce, (1964) p. 40), or \\"to discover a safe method of robbery or cheating\\";Eric Partridge A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English. London: Bibliophile Books, 1982; p. 269 * Verb meaning in Irish slang 'to throw' (e.g., 'He's got no manners at all. I asked him nicely for the remote control, and he fecked it across the table at me.') ==Scots and Late Middle English== Feck (or fek or feic) is a form of , which is in turn the Scots cognate of the modern English word effect. However, this Scots noun has additional significance: # Efficacy; force; value; return # Amount; quantity (or a large amount/quantity) # The greater or larger part (when used with a definite article) From the first sense we derive feckless, meaning witless, weak or ineffective; worthless; irresponsible; indifferent; lazy. Feckless remains a part of the Modern English and Scottish English lexicons; it appears in a number of Scottish adages: :\\"Feckless folk are aye fain o ane anither.\\" :\\"Feckless fools should keep canny tongues.\\" In his 1881 short story Thrawn Janet, Robert Louis Stevenson invokes the second sense of feck as cited above: :\\"He had a feck o' books wi' him‚Äîmair than had ever been seen before in a' that presbytery...\\" Robert Burns uses the third sense of feck in the final stanza of his 1792 poem \\"Kellyburn Braes\\": :I hae been a Devil the feck o' my life, :Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme; :\\"But ne'er was in hell till I met wi' a wife,\\" :And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime ==Debate about the word's level of offensiveness== Magners Irish Cider have received complaints relating to an advert in which a man tells bees to \\"feck off\\": members of the public were concerned that young children could be badly influenced by seeing this advert. Magners claimed that the \\"feck off\\" mention in the advert was a \\"mild rebuff\\" to the bees, rather than an expletive. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has ruled that the poster is suitable for display. In a 1998 interview on Nickelodeon, Irish girl group B*Witched landed in hot water when a viewer made a complaint alleging that one of the teenagers had used the phrase \\"fuck off\\". Although Nickelodeon maintained that the singer had in fact said \\"feck off\\", which they described \\"a phrase made popular by the Channel 4 sitcom Father Ted,\\" the item was found to be in breach of the ITC Programme Code and the complaint was thus upheld. ==In popular culture== The Channel 4 situation comedy Father Ted helped to export and popularise this use of feck through its characters' liberal use of the word, especially by the drunk priest Father Jack.

Named after the Oski Yell, he made his debut during Cal Football's season-opener against St. Mary's College on September 27, 1941. Prior to his debut, live bears were used as Cal mascots. Oski's name, design, and character were developed by William ‚ÄúRocky‚Äù Rockwell, who was the first student to play the role, and Warrington Colescott, an editor of The Daily Californian and famed satirist. Since his debut, Oski's activities have been managed by the Oski Committee, which also appoints a new Oski whenever a replacement is required; Oski's identity is protected by the Committee, and wearers of the suit generally do not disclose their identity. To that end, there may be multiple members of the Committee who wear the suit, depending on their schedules. ==Songs== Oski is mentioned by name in several California fight songs. In the songs, the name \\"Oski\\" is used interchangeably with the title \\"Golden Bear\\". Several of the songs give an impression of Oski being a powerful guardian-being dwelling in the heavens, as well as sallying forth from a lair on Earth. Oski is identified as the astronomical constellation Ursa Major (the Great Bear). Although Oski has his benign side (\\"patient\\" and \\"silent\\"), he is more often presented as growling, fighting, rumbling, grumbling, thundering, and shaking the ground. He is described as sturdy and mighty. It is said of Oski that he \\"wears a Paderewski hair\\", referring to Oski's shaggy hair. Oski is described as \\"Our totem\\", and Cal's teams (or perhaps Cal students in general) are described as sons of the Golden Bear. In one song, Oski is referred to as \\"He\\" with a capital \\"H\\", as one refers to the Deity. One song appears to attribute to Oski the ability to fly through the air. These characteristics are seen in the following lyrics of Cal fight songs: Fight for California -- > Our sturdy Golden Bear Is watching from the skies; Looks down upon our > colors fair, And guards us from his lair. Big \\"C\\" -- > Golden Bear is ever watching; Day by day he prowls The Stanford Jonah -- > When our Oski rips through the air. Like our friend Mister Jonah, Stanford's > team will be found, In the tummy of the Golden Bear. Cal Band March -- > And when the game's done, California's Golden Bear has carried the day. California, We're For You -- > All our rival's hopes are doomed to die, When our Golden Bear looks down on > high; Hear our Oski's mighty thunder, ... Brawn and brain are all in vain > Unless our spirit's there In ev'ry son of the Golden Bear. ... Let the > echoes ring our Oski Golden Bear -- > Oh, have you seen the heavens blue, heavens blue, When just sev'n stars are > shining through, shining through Right overhead a jovial crew? They're > joining hands to make the Bear ... And oh, that Bear's a glorious sight, > glorious sight, A-circling 'round the pole all night, pole all night; And > once you've seen him, you're all right, You've seen our California Bear. ... > He has a very patient air, patient air, He wears a Paderewski hair, 'rewski > hair, He's the center rush of the heavens I swear, Our silent, sturdy Golden > Bear. ...

Stephen Phillips (28 July 1864 ‚Äì 9 December 1915) was an English poet and dramatist, who enjoyed considerable popularity early in his career. ==Biography== He was born at Somertown near Oxford, the son of the Rev. Stephen Phillips, precentor of Peterborough Cathedral. He was educated at Stratford and Peterborough Grammar Schools, and considered entering Queens' College, Cambridge on a minor scholarship to study classics; but he instead went to a London crammer to prepare for the civil service.J. P. Wearing, ‚ÄòPhillips, Stephen (1864‚Äì1915)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Jan 2008, accessed 1 June 2009 In 1885, however, he moved to Wolverhampton to join his cousin F. R. Benson's dramatic company, and for six years he played various small parts. Stephen Phillips In 1890 a slender volume of verse was published at Oxford with the title Primavera, which contained contributions by him and by his cousin Laurence Binyon and others. In 1894 he published Eremus, a long poem of loose structure in blank verse of a philosophical complexion. In 1896 appeared Christ in Hades, forming with a few other short pieces one of the slim paper- covered volumes of Elkin Mathews's Shilling Garland. This poem caught the eye of the critics, and when it was followed by a collection of Poems in 1897 the writer's position as a new poet of exceptional gifts was generally recognized. This volume contained a new edition of Christ in Hades, together with Marpessa, The Woman with the Dead Soul, The Wife and shorter pieces, including To Milton, Blind. The volume won the prize of ¬£100 offered by the Academy newspaper for the best new book of its year, ran through half a dozen editions in two years, and established Phillips's rank as poet, which was sustained by the publication, in the Nineteenth Century in 1898 of his poem Endymion. Stephen Phillips Sir George Alexander, the actor-manager, moved perhaps by a certain clamour among the critics for a literary drama, then commissioned Phillips to write him a play, the result being Paolo and Francesca (1900), a drama founded on Dante's famous episode from Inferno. Encouraged by the great success of the drama in its literary form, Mr Alexander produced the piece at the St. James' Theatre in 1902.Produced by Sir George Alexander at the St. James' Theatre beginning 6 March 1902. Mason, p. 237. In the meantime, Phillips's next play, Herod: a Tragedy, had been produced by Beerbohm Tree on 31 October 1900, and was published as a book in 1901; Ulysses, also produced by Beerbohm Tree, was published in 1902; The Sin of David, a drama on the story of David and Bathsheba, translated into the times and terms of Cromwellian England, was published in 1904; and Nero, produced by Beerbohm Tree, was published in 1906. In these plays the poet's avowed aim was, instead of attempting to revive the method of Shakespeare and the Elizabethans, to revitalize the method of Greek drama. Paolo and Francesca (which admitted certainly one scene on an Elizabethan model) was the most successful. When a theatrical production of Ulysses was staged at Her Majesty's Theatre, London, in 1902 the opening night was attended by the Royal Family, nobility, politicians, and many other members of high society. The 29 January 1902 issue of The Tatler reported that the artist Henry Jamyn Brooks was working on a picture of the attendees, which was to include some 300 portraits. See the section on Stephen Phillips in Poets of the Younger Generation, by William Archer (1902); also the articles on Tragedy and Mr Stephen Phillips, by William Watson in the Fortnightly Review (March 1898); The Poetry of Mr Stephen Phillips, in the Edinburgh Review (January 1900); Mr Stephen Phillips, in the Century (January 1901), by Edmund Gosse; and Mr Stephen Phillips, in the Quarterly Review (April 1902), by Arthur Symons. ==References== ==Sources== * * Mason, A.

He was a regular in the first season of the show, as Commander of the Babylon 5 station, and made a number of guest appearances afterward. == Role in Babylon 5 Character arc=== The character's backstory is given as having been born on Mars Colony. In an early episode of season one, Sinclair states that his family had been pilots \\"ever since the Battle of Britain\\" and Sinclair's father was a fighter pilot for EarthForce who participated in the Battle of Balos, the last engagement of the Dilgar Invasion. Sinclair continued the tradition and became a fighter pilot. Sinclair enlisted in EarthForce in 2237. During his time at EarthForce Academy, he met Catherine Sakai, with whom he had a relationship. After a year of living together, the two of them broke up, but continued to see each other off and on through 2258, when they became engaged. Sakai went missing in late 2259, while on a mission for the Rangers.Her disappearance is explained in this canon novel, To Dream in the City of Sorrows. The season one episode \\"By Any Means Necessary\\" establishes that Sinclair received Jesuit education as a young man. In 2240, Sinclair was promoted to fighter pilot, continuing a Sinclair family tradition that had extended as far back as the Battle of Britain. Less than a year later, Sinclair was promoted to squadron leader; due to his rapid rise through the ranks, the rumor of the day was that Sinclair was on the fast track to making Admiral. As squadron leader, Sinclair fought at the Battle of the Line, the last major battle in the Earth-Minbari War. During the course of the battle, his squadron was destroyed by the Minbari, and his fighter was badly damaged. In a last act of defiance, Sinclair attempted to ram one of the Minbari cruisers. He failed in this when he was captured by another Minbari cruiser for interrogation by the Grey Council. The Council's Triluminary detected Valen's DNA in Sinclair, so they assumed, to their profound shock, that he possessed the soul of Valen, a hero of the Minbari who led them to victory 1,000 years ago against the Shadows. It was concluded by the Grey Council that Minbari souls were being born into human bodies. The discovery of what Sinclair possessed led the Minbari to surrender and return Sinclair to his fighter, the memory of his time aboard the Minbari cruiser blocked (though this block would not be permanent and would break down years later). Sinclair ‚Äî and the Earth Alliance ‚Äî believed that he had blacked out from the acceleration. When Babylon 5 was brought into operation in 2257, Sinclair was selected by the Minbari to command the newly constructed station. He was selected over many more senior officers, including Colonel Ari Ben Zayn, all of whom had been vetoed by the Minbari (they had stipulated that they should approve the choice of Station Commander, as they had shared the cost of construction). In January 2259, Sinclair was reassigned as ambassador to Minbar, where he took command of the Rangers. He was succeeded at Babylon 5 by Captain John Sheridan. In 2260, Sinclair received a 900-year old letter from himself on Minbar, revealing that he was not the reincarnation of Valen, as the Grey Council believed, but in fact Valen himself. Armed with this knowledge, Sinclair took Babylon 4 back with him 1,000 years to aid the Minbari in their first war against the Shadows, and in so doing, fulfilled Minbari prophecy by becoming the One Who Was. It was here that Sinclair used the triluminary to transform himself into a Minbari, thus fulfilling the legend about Valen being \\"a Minbari not born of Minbari\\", also explaining why the triluminary responded so strongly to him during his interrogation by the Grey Council, as it had been programmed to respond to his DNA. === Characterization === The character of Jeffrey Sinclair has been subject to several literary analysis, for example as a hero and as a leader. == Conceptual history == After one full season, O'Hare and series executive producer/creator J. Michael Straczynski made the mutual and amicable decision for the character and actor to depart as a regular.Original GEnie post Message 560 by Straczynski on Fri May 20, 1994 O'Hare subsequently reprised the character of Sinclair briefly in season two and a two-episode guest appearance in season three, enabling the show to wrap up loose ends. As a result of this departure, there are several minor inconsistencies between the first season and the remainder of the show, most visibly in \\"And the Sky Full of Stars\\" and \\"Babylon Squared\\". At O'Hare's personal request, the full reasons for his departure from the show were kept secret until after his death in 2012. The following year, Straczynski revealed that O'Hare struggled with delusions and paranoia due to mental illness, which ultimately prevented him from continuing to act. However, Straczynski emphasized that O'Hare's fans, particularly those of his role as Sinclair, had helped him cope with his struggle in ways medication never could. == Reception == ==External links== * Jeffrey Sinclair at The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5 ==References== Category:Babylon 5 characters Category:Fictional commanders ru:–°–ø–∏—Å–æ–∫ –ø–µ—Ä—Å–æ–Ω–∞–∂–µ–π —Ç–µ–ª–µ—Å–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª–∞ ¬´–í–∞–≤–∏–ª–æ–Ω-5¬ª#–î–∂–µ—Ñ—Ñ—Ä–∏ –°–∏–Ω–∫–ª–µ—Ä ","title":"Jeffrey Sinclair"},{"id":"821931","text":"The Louisiana Museum of Modern Art is an art museum located on the shore of the √òresund Sound in Humleb√¶k, north of Copenhagen, Denmark. It is the most visited art museum in Denmark, and has an extensive permanent collection of modern and contemporary art, dating from World War II to the present day; in addition, it has a comprehensive programme of special exhibitions. The museum is also acknowledged as a milestone in modern Danish architecture, and is noted for its synthesis of art, architecture, and landscape, such as was showcased in an installation entitled \\"Riverbed\\" shown in 2014-2015. The museum occasionally also stages exhibitions of work by the great impressionists and expressionists, e.g. Claude Monet was the focus of a major exhibition in 1994. The museum is included in the Patricia Schultz book 1,000 Places to See Before You Die and ranks 85th on a list of the most visited art museums in the world (2011). ==Location== The museum is located by the √òresund coast in the North Zeeland region, some north of central Copenhagen and south of Elsinore. From the regional train station in Humleb√¶k, it takes 10-15 minutes to walk to the museum. ==History== The name of the museum derives from the first owner of the property, Alexander Brun, who named the villa after his three wives, all called Louise. The museum was created in 1958 by Knud W. Jensen, the owner at the time. He contacted architects Vilhelm Wohlert and J√∏rgen Bo who spent a few months walking around the property before deciding how a new construction would best fit into the landscape. This study resulted in the first version of the museum consisting of three buildings connected by glass corridors. Since then it has been extended several times until it reached its present circular shape in 1991. In late November 2012, Louisiana Museum of Modern Art launched Louisiana Channel, a web-TV channel contributing to the development of the museum as a cultural platform. In 2013, the museum's music department launched Louisiana Music, a webpage dedicated to musical videos produced by the museum in collaboration with world-famous musicians. View of the sea from the museum lawn. ==CollectionsModern art=== The museum has a wide range of modern art paintings, sculptures and videos dating from World War II to the present day, including works by artists such as Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Anselm Kiefer, Alberto Giacometti, Pablo Picasso, Yves Klein, Robert Rauschenberg, David Hockney and Asger Jorn. The videos are often housed in room settings where the viewer is made to feel part of the scene being portrayed. Perched above the sea, there is a sculpture garden between the museum's two wings with works by artists including Henry Moore, Alexander Calder, and Jean Arp. ===Wessel-Bagge collection=== Besides the collection of modern art, Louisiana also displays a collection of Pre- Columbian art. Consisting of more than 400 objects, the collection was a donation from the Wessel-Bagge Foundation in 2001. It is the personal collection left by Niels-Wessel Bagge, a California-based Danish dancer, choreographer, and art collector, who died in 1990. == Exhibitions == The Louisiana Museum mounts temporary exhibitions, including installations such as Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson's site-specific work \\"Riverbed\\", which was made specifically for the museum and shown from August 2014 to January 2015. The work was in three sections with a theme that related art, architecture and nature, in which a rocky riverbed was created to take up the museum's entire south wing. The concert hall ==Concert hall== The Concert Hall was built in 1976 in connection with the West Wing which had been built in 1966 and 1971. Its acoustics make it especially suitable for chamber music, but it is also used for other musical genres as well as a wide array of others events and activities such as debates, lectures and symposiums. The chairs are designed by Poul Kj√¶rholm and the rear wall is decorated with paintings created for the site by Sam Francis. In 2007 began a project to produce concerts filming and musical clips directed by St√©phan Aub√©. All the movies are available for free on the Louisiana Music website. Sculpture garden, Louisiana Art Museum. ==Sculpture garden== The grounds around the museum contain a landscaped sculpture garden. It consists of a plateau and ground that slopes towards the √òresund and is dominated by huge, ancient specimen trees and sweeping vistas of the sea. It contains works by such artists as Jean Arp, Max Ernst, Max Bill, Alexander Calder, Henri Laurens, Louise Bourgeois, Joan Mir√≥ and Henry Moore. The sculptures are either placed so that they can be viewed from within, in special sculpture yards or independently around the gardens, forming a synthesis with the lawns, the trees and the sea. There are also examples of site-specific art by such artists as Enzo Cucchi, Dani Karavan and George Trakas.

It is used in a wide range of rifles, pistols, revolvers, smoothbore shotguns, and submachine guns. In terms of units sold it is by far the most common ammunition in the world today. ==History== American cartridge manufacturer Union Metallic Cartridge Company most likely introduced the .22 Long Rifle cartridge as early as 1884.Goff, Byron: .22 Long Rifle Origin, page 7. Single Shot Rifle Journal, Vol 72, No 4, 2019. The round owes its origin to the .22 BB Cap of 1845 and the .22 Short of 1857. It combined the casing of the .22 Long of 1871 with a 45 gr bullet, giving it a longer overall length, a higher muzzle velocity and superior performance as a hunting and target round, rendering the .22 Extra Long cartridges obsolete. The .22 LR uses a heeled bullet, which means that the bullet is the same diameter as the case, and has a narrower \\"heel\\" portion that fits in the case. It is one of the few cartridges that are accepted by a large variety of rifles and handguns. ===Popularity in the United States=== The .22 LR cartridge is popular with both novice shooters and experts. Its minimal recoil and relatively low noise make it an ideal cartridge for recreational shooting, small-game hunting, and pest control. .22 LR cadet rifles are commonly used by military cadets and others for basic firearms and marksmanship training. It is used by the Boy Scouts of America for the rifle shooting merit badge. The low recoil of the cartridge makes it ideal for introductory firearms courses. Novice shooters can be surprised or frightened by the noise and recoil of more powerful rounds. Beginners shooting firearms beyond their comfort level frequently develop a habit of flinching in an attempt to counter anticipated recoil. The resulting habit impedes correct posture and follow-through at the most critical phase of the shot and is difficult to correct. With high recoil eliminated, other errors in marksmanship technique are easier to identify and correct. Available for this round are AR-15 upper receivers and M1911 slide assemblies. Many handgun manufacturers have an upper pistol conversion kit to make it shoot .22 LR ammunition. These conversions allow shooters to practice inexpensively while retaining the handling characteristics of their chosen firearms (with reduced recoil and muzzle blast). Additionally, .22 LR cartridge conversion kits allow practice at indoor ranges which prohibit high-power firearms. Owners of guns that use gas systems, such as AR-15 sport style rifles, normally avoid firing non-jacketed .22 LR cartridge ammunition, as the use of unjacketed ammunition may cause lead-fouling of the gas-port inside the barrel and costly gunsmithing procedures. This can usually be mitigated by swapping the conversion kit for the standard bolt carrier group, and firing several full- powered rounds to clear the gas port and tube of any accumulated lead fouling. While not 100% effective, the extremely hot incandescent gasses produced by centerfire rifle ammunition will help to clear any lead fouling from the .22LR ammunition. A wide variety of .22 LR ammunition is available commercially, and the available ammunition varies widely both in price and performance. Bullet weights among commercially available ammunition range from , and velocities vary from . .22 LR is the least costly cartridge ammunition available. Promotional loads for plinking can be purchased in bulk for significantly less cost than precision target rounds. The low cost of ammunition has a substantial effect on the popularity of the .22 LR. For this reason, rimfire cartridges are commonly used for target practice. .22 LR cartridges are commonly packaged in boxes of 50 or 100 rounds, and is often sold by the 'brick', a carton containing either 10 boxes of 50 rounds or loose cartridges totaling 500 rounds, or the 'case' containing 10 bricks totaling 5,000 rounds. Annual production is estimated by some at 2‚Äì2.5 billion rounds. The NSSF estimates that a large percentage of the US production of 10 billion cartridges is composed of .22 LR. Despite the high production figures there have occasionally been shortages of .22 LR cartridge in the contiguous United States, most notably during the U.S. ammunition shortage of the late 2000s and early 2010s. == Performance == Two .22 LR rounds compared to a .45 ACP cartridge The .22 LR is effective to , though practical ranges tend to be less. After 150 yd, the ballistics of the round are such that it will be difficult to compensate for the large \\"drop\\". The relatively short effective range, low report, and light recoil have made it a favorite for use as a target-practice cartridge. The accuracy of the cartridge is good, but not exceptional; various cartridges are capable of the same or better accuracy. A contributing factor in rifles is the transition of even a high-velocity cartridge projectile from supersonic to subsonic within . As the bullet slows, the shock wave caused by supersonic travel overtakes the bullet and can disrupt its flight path, causing minor but measurable inaccuracies. When zeroed for , the arc-trajectory of the standard high-velocity .22 LR with a 40-gr bullet has a rise at , and a drop at . A .22 LR rifle needs to be zeroed for to avoid overshooting small animals like squirrels at intermediate distances. As a hunting cartridge, rimfires are mainly used to kill small game up to the size of coyotes. Although proper shot placement can kill larger animals such as deer or hog, it is not recommended because its low power may not guarantee a humane kill. The largest recorded animal killed with a .22 LR rifle was a grizzly bear in 1953. In 2013, an elephant was killed by multiple shots from a .22 LR rifle. Because a .22 LR bullet is less powerful than larger cartridges, its danger to humans is often underestimated. In fact, a .22 LR bullet is easily capable of killing or injuring humans. Even after flying , a .22 bullet is still traveling about . Ricochets are more common in .22 LR projectiles than for more powerful cartridges as the combination of unjacketed lead and moderate velocities allows the projectile to deflect ‚Äì not penetrate or disintegrate ‚Äì when hitting hard objects at a glancing angle. A .22 LR bullet can ricochet off the surface of water at a low angle of aim. Severe injury may result to a person or object in the line of fire on the opposite shore, several hundred yards away. A .22 LR bullet is capable of traveling , which is more than . Rimfire bullets are generally either plain lead with a wax coating (for standard-velocity loads) or plated with copper or gilding metal (for high-velocity or hyper-velocity loads). The thin copper layer on plated bullet functions as a lubricant reducing friction between the bullet and the barrel, thus reducing barrel wear. Plating also prevents oxidation of the lead bullet. Lead tends to oxidize if stored for long periods. On a plain lead bullet, oxide on the bullet's surface can increase its diameter enough to either prevent insertion of the cartridge into the chamber, or ‚Äì with high velocity rounds ‚Äì cause dangerously high pressures in the barrel, potentially rupturing the cartridge case and injuring the shooter; for that reason, standard and subsonic cartridges usually use a wax lubricant on lead bullets. ==Variants== The variety of .22 LR loads are often divided into four distinct categories, based on nominal velocity: * Subsonic, which also includes \\"target\\" or \\"match\\" loads, at nominal speeds below 1100 feet (335 meters) per second. * Standard-velocity: 1120-1135 feet (340-345 meters) per second. * High-velocity: 1200-1310 feet (365-400 meters) per second. * Hyper-velocity, or Ultra-velocity: over 1400 feet (425 meters) per second. ===Subsonic=== Aguila Super Colibri .22 caliber Aguila Sniper Sub-Sonic (right) with .22 long rifle for comparison Subsonic rounds have a muzzle velocity of less than the speed of sound (about ). These rounds are sometimes equipped with extra-heavy bullets of to improve the terminal ballistics of the slower projectile. Conversely, these rounds may contain little more than a primer and an extra-light bullet. Subsonic rounds are favored by some shooters due to slightly superior accuracy and reduction in noise. Supersonic rounds produce a loud crack which can scare away animals when hunting. Accuracy is reportedly improved with subsonic rounds because a supersonic bullet (or projectile) that slows from supersonic to subsonic speed undergoes drastic aerodynamic changes in this transonic zone that might adversely affect the stability and accuracy of the bullet. Because the speed of sound in air at 68 ¬∞F (20 ¬∞C) is about , the subsonic round's muzzle velocity is slightly below the speed of sound under many hunting conditions. However, under cold air conditions at 32 ¬∞F (0 ¬∞C), the speed of sound drops to , approximately muzzle velocity. Hence, a \\"subsonic\\" round used below this temperature may be supersonic, and during the transition from supersonic to subsonic velocity, it may become unstable, reducing accuracy. To counteract this, some cartridge manufacturers have lowered the speed of their subsonic ammunition to or less. Various combinations of subsonic rounds and semiautomatic .22 LR firearms result in unreliable cycling of the firearms' actions, as the result of insufficient recoil energy. Some subsonic rounds use heavier bullets (achieving lower velocities) to ensure, as a result of increased bullet mass, that enough energy is produced to cycle common blow-back actions. As an example, the Aguila .22 LR SSS \\"Sniper SubSonic\\" round, has a 60-gr bullet on a .22 short case, providing the cartridge the same overall dimensions as a .22 long rifle round. However, other problems may be encountered: the heavier and longer bullet of the Aguila cartridge requires a faster barrel twist (by the Greenhill formula) to ensure the bullet remains stable in flight. Two performance classes of .22 rimfire subsonic rounds exist. Some subsonic rounds, such as various .22 short and .22 long \\"CB\\" rounds, give about velocity with a 29-gr bullet providing relatively low impact energy (41 J at muzzle). These may not use any, or only small amounts of gunpowder, and have the characteristics of rounds intended only for indoor training or target practice rather than hunting. Where these are in .22 LR form, it is only to aid feeding in firearms designed for the cartridge, rather than older .22 CB shooting gallery rifles. The Aguila SSS gives about velocity with a 60-gr bullet offering energy (163 Joules) equivalent to many high velocity .22 long rifle rounds using standard 40-gr bullets. Other heavy-bullet subsonic rounds give similar performance, and are intended for hunting of small game, or control of dangerous animals, while avoiding excessive noise. ===Standard velocity=== Schlieren high-speed video of a .22 LR travelling in free-flight demonstrating the air pressure dynamics surrounding the bullet The velocity of standard-velocity .22 LR rounds varies between manufacturers. Some standard velocity ammo may be slightly supersonic-around , other ammo such as CCI Standard Velocity .22 LR ammunition is rated at . Most standard velocity ammo has a bullet weight of . Standard-velocity cartridges generate near or slightly supersonic velocities. These rounds generally do not develop these velocities in handguns because their short barrels do not take full advantage of the slower burning powder. ===High velocity=== High-velocity, copper-plated .22 LR rounds The .22 long rifle round was originally loaded with black powder. The first smokeless powder loads were intended to match the standard velocity of the original black-powder rounds. Smokeless powder is more efficient than black powder, and the cartridge cases could hold more powder. Smokeless powder loads, called \\"high speed\\" or \\"high velocity\\", were offered by the major ammunition makers, giving a typical velocity increase of 8% ( to ) while still using the standard 40-gr solid or 36-gr hollow-point lead bullet. ===Hyper-velocity=== Many .22 LR cartridges use bullets lighter than the standard 40 gr, fired at even higher velocities. Hyper-velocity bullets usually weigh around and can have a muzzle velocity of . This higher velocity is partially due to the use of lighter bullets. The CCI Stinger was the first hyper-velocity .22 LR cartridge, and provided a significant increase in velocity and energy over standard rimfire rounds. The Stinger case is longer than that of the long rifle; about versus for the long rifle, but the plated hollow point bullet is lighter and shorter at , giving the same overall length as the long rifle cartridge. This longer case can cause ejection problems in some guns. A powder with a slower burning rate is used to make the most use of the length of a rifle barrel. Most .22 long rifle powders increase velocity up to about of barrel. The powder used in the Stinger increases velocity up to the longest .22 barrel length tested by the NRA, . Later hyper-velocity rounds were introduced by other makers, based on the long rifle case with lighter bullets in the 30-gr weight range and slow-burning rifle powder loadings. The overall length of many of these cartridges was less than the overall length of the standard 40-gr bullet long rifle cartridge. One example is the Remington Viper; another is the Federal Spitfire. The CCI Velocitor hyper-velocity round uses the standard long rifle case size and a standard weight bullet of proprietary hollow-point design to augment expansion and trauma. This cartridge has a muzzle velocity of and matches the overall length of the standard long rifle cartridge. ===Shot cartridges=== .22 snake shot with shot capsule Federal .22 LR Bird Shot with full length crimped case Special .22 LR caliber shot cartridges, usually loaded with No. 12 shot, have also been made. These are often called \\"snake shot,\\" \\"bird shot\\" and \\"rat-shot\\" due to their use in very short range pest control. Such rounds have either a longer brass case that is crimped closed, or a translucent plastic \\"bullet\\" that contains the shot and shatters upon firing. In specially made .22-bore shotguns, the shot shells can be used for short-range skeet shooting and trap shooting at special, scaled-down, clay targets. ===Full metal jacket=== During World War II, a full metal jacket bullet version of the .22 LR was developed as the T-42 for the silenced High Standard HDM pistol. The US Army Air Corps procured the Savage Model 24 .22 LR/.410 combination gun as an air crew survival weapon included in the E series of survival and sustenance kits, primarily to forage for game for food. The .22 LR full metal jacket bullet ammunition was issued with these firearms for military use to comply with treaty restrictions on expanding bullets. The 1961 Army/Air Force Technical Manual/Order on ammunition lists three types of rimfire CARTRIDGE, CALIBER .22: Ball, Long Rifle: *Long Rifle (Lead Bullet), propellant: 1.7 gr smokeless, bullet: 40 gr, overall length: 0.984 inch. *Long Rifle (Commercial), propellant: 2.1 gr smokeless, bullet: 40 gr, overall length: about 1 inch. *Long Rifle, M24 (Jacketed Bullet), propellant: 2.5 gr smokeless, bullet: 40.5 gr, overall length: 0.995 inch. The first type specifies standard or target velocity .22 LR while the second is common high velocity commercial ammo. While these soft lead round nose bullet types were suitable for training or target practice, they are not legal for use in a war zone. Since .22 LR air crew survival weapons would probably be used in a war zone and could be used for defense, the M24 round is loaded with a hard lead-antimony alloy core bullet with a gilding metal jacket.Army Tech Manual TM9-1305-200 / Air Force Tech Order TO 11A13-1-101 June 1961 ===Tracer=== Tracer ammunition is also available in rimfire. ==Cartridge construction== The traditional .22 rimfire cartridges (BB, CB, short, long, extra long, and long rifle) differ in construction from more modern cartridges in the way the bullet is constructed and held in the case. Bullets for traditional .22 rimfires are the same outside diameter as the case but are constructed with a narrower cupped \\"heel\\" on the base of the bullet which is inserted into the case. The case mouth is then crimped around the heel, leaving exposed the majority of the bullet bearing surface that contacts the barrel of the gun. The bearing surface of .22 rimfire bullets is often lubricated and the surface is exposed to contamination. This was a common design in the early black powder cartridge era. In later cartridges including the .22 WRF and .22 WMR rimfires and modern centerfires, the bullet body is a uniform diameter and the bearing surface is inserted completely within the neck of the cartridge case, held in place by tension from the case neck around the bullet bearing surface (in some cartridges the case mouth maybe also be crimped into a cannelure (groove) in the bullet). The heeled bullet cartridge is considered weaker than the uniform diameter bullet cartridge which encloses the bearing surface of the bullet within the cartridge neck. Overall reliability of heeled bullet rimfire ammunition is high, but it is lower than the reliability of most centerfire ammunition. ==Cartridge length== A .22 Short, .22 LR, .22 Winchester Magnum, and a .22 Hornet The .22 LR uses a straight-walled case. Depending upon the type and the feed mechanism employed, a firearm that is chambered for .22 LR may also be able to safely chamber and fire the following shorter rimfire cartridges: * .22 BB, in cap, short, and long lengths * .22 CB, in cap, short, long, and long rifle lengths * .22 Short * .22 Long The .22 Long Rifle may also be used in firearms chambered for the obsolete .22 Extra Long. ==Usage== Today, rimfire rounds are mainly used for hunting small pests, for sports shooting, for plinking, and for inexpensive training. The .22 LR is the choice for several shooting events: biathlon, bullseye, plus divisions of benchrest shooting, metallic silhouette and pin shooting, most high school, collegiate, Boy Scouts of America, Project Appleseed, 4H shooting events, and many others. It is also used in the precision Rifle and Pistol shooting events at the Olympic Games. Good quality rimfire ammunition can be quite accurate. The main advantages are low cost, low recoil, low noise and high accuracy-to-cost ratio. The main disadvantage is its low power; it is better suited for use on small game and other small animals. As a defensive cartridge, it is considered inadequate by many, though the small size allows very lightweight, easily concealable handguns which can be carried in circumstances where anything larger would be impractical. Despite their limitations, people can use .22 LR pistols and rifles for defense, and are common simply because they are prevalent, inexpensive, and widely available. Most semi-automatic rifles firing .22 LR cartridges will often only work properly when firing standard or high velocity rimfire ammunition, as the low recoil of subsonic rounds is insufficient to cycle the weapon's action. Rifles with manual actions do not have this problem. Due to the low bolt thrust of the .22 LR cartridge, most self-loading firearms chambered for the cartridge use the direct blowback operation system. The tiny case of the .22 LR and the subsonic velocities (when using subsonic ammunition) make it well suited for use with a firearm suppressor (also known as silencers or sound moderators). The low volume of powder gases means that .22 LR suppressors are often no larger than a bull barrel; the Ruger 10/22 and Ruger MK II are common choices, because of their reliability and low cost, and the resulting product is often nearly indistinguishable from a bull barrel model (although weighing far less). Where firearm suppressors are only minimally restricted, a .22 LR firearm with a suppressor is often favored for plinking, as it does not require hearing protection or disturb the neighbors. Local government agencies sometimes use suppressed rimfire weapons for animal control, since dangerous animals or pests can be dispatched in populated areas without causing undue alarm. The .22 LR has also seen limited usage by police and military snipers. Its main advantage in this role is its low noise, but it is usually limited to urban operations because of its short range. The Israeli military used a suppressed .22 LR rifle in the 1990s for riot control and to \\"eliminate disturbing dogs prior to operations\\", though it is now used less often as it has been shown to be more lethal than previously suspected. Some other examples include the use of suppressed High Standard HDM pistols by the American OSS, which was the predecessor organization of the CIA. Francis Gary Powers was issued a suppressed High Standard for the flight in which he was shot down. Suppressed Ruger MK II pistols were used by the US Navy SEALs in the 1990s. ==Cartridge dimensions== .22 long rifle cartridge dimensions in inches 400px .22 long rifle maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimetres (mm). The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 406 mm (1:16 in), six grooves, land width = 2.16 mm, √ò lands = 5.38 mm, √ò grooves = 5.58 mm. According to the official C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes √† Feu Portatives) rulings the .22 long rifle can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers. Because the .22 long rifle round commonly uses a heeled lead or lightly plated bullet, the nominal bullet diameter is larger than the nominal bore diameter to prevent excessive lead fouling that can occur when shooting lead bullets that are the same or slightly smaller than the groove diameter. SAAMI specifies a nominal bullet diameter of 0.2255 with a tolerance of -0.004, while the specified bore diameter is 0.222. In practice, 0.224 or slightly larger bullets are common, with barrel groove diameters commonly around 0.223. ==Muzzle velocity (nominal)== * lead: .22 LR subsonic * copper plated lead: .22 LR high velocity * copper plated lead: .22 LR hyper-velocity CCI Stinger Note: actual velocities are dependent on many factors, such as barrel length of a given firearm and manufacturer of a given batch of ammunition, and will vary widely in practice. The above velocities are typical. ==See also== * .25 ACP * .220 Rook * 5 mm caliber * Cadet rifle * List of rimfire cartridges * Table of handgun and rifle cartridges ==References== ==External links== * 22LR Ballistics Chart for 27 different cartridges * Ballistics By The Inch .22 Results (including .22 Long Rifle).

One of his teachers was Ernst Wiechert. In 1937, he started a degree in art history in Berlin. As a member of the Confessing Church, Bobrowski had contact with the German resistance against National Socialism. He was a lance corporal for the entire Second World War in Poland, France and the Soviet Union. In 1943 he married Johanna Buddrus. From 1945 to 1949 Bobrowski was imprisoned by the Soviet Union, where he spent time working in a coal mine. On his release, he returned home to his family in the suburban Berlin district of Friedrichshagen,Scrase, David (1995). Understanding Johannes Bobrowski.

He worked as an editor, first for the Altberliner Verlag, a children's publisher run by Lucie Grosner, and then, from 1959 on, for the Union Verlag publishing house. Bobrowski's work was influenced by his knowledge of Eastern European landscapes and of the German, Baltic and Slavic cultures and languages, combined with ancient myths. His first poems were published during the war, in 1944, in the Munich-based journal Das innere Reich. In 1960 he read his poems at a meeting in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria, of the influential West German literary association Group 47 (Gruppe 47).Wieczorek, John (1999). \\"Johannes Bobrowski und die Gruppe 47.\\" In: Keith Stuart Parkes and John J.

The following year his first book of collected poems, Sarmatische Zeit (Sarmatian Times), was published in both West and East Germany. After having missed the fall 1961 meeting of the Group 47, since it took place just after the building of the Berlin Wall, he was able to attend the subsequent meeting, held in October 1962 at the Wannsee, in West Berlin. On that occasion he read seven poems from those that would later appear in his collection Wetterzeichen (Weather signs), and was awarded the group's prestigious literary prize. In 1964, Bobrowski became a member of the PEN Club. Bobrowski died as a result of a perforated appendix in East Berlin on 2 September 1965, and was buried in the Friedrichshagen cemetery.

She is the Mistress of Magic and Mother of Mysteries who guides the Weave of magic that envelops the world.

At other times she was depicted as a vaguely female humanoid form composed entirely of prismatic-hued will-o‚Äô-wisps. According to Ao, Mystryl had ultimate control over all magic and could shape it to her will, and she could withdraw a being's access to the Weave and prevent it from using spells of any sort, and in an even harsher restriction she could also prevent a being from using any sort of magic whatsoever if she so decreed. These conditions persisted until she removed them. Mystryl could even deny deities access to the Weave, but she couldn't deny other gods the ability to grant their worshipers spells through prayer. True to her chaotic nature, Mystryl was flirtatious and profound, flighty and persistent, light-hearted and deadly serious. Her moods and state- of-mind varied from moment to moment, but she generally tried to do what she thought was right. She seemed too trusting and innocent at times, and tended to overreact when she felt she had been tricked. She distrusted but didn't hate Shar, who had sought to seize control over her for centuries, and she also rebelled occasionally against the good-intentioned suggestions of Selune, who she regarded as smotheringly maternal at times. Kozah and Moander, who always seemed intent on ruining that which she created or inspired, were her mortal enemies. Mystryl died when Karsus, wanting to take her place as god of Magic created the most powerful spell ever (12th level spell) and nearly destroyed the Weave. Mystryl sacrificed herself to save the Weave before it was too late. ===Second Incarnation=== Mystra came into being after Mystryl sacrificed herself to save Faer√ªn from the destruction of Netheril caused by Karsus in DR -339. Mystryl sacrificed herself to save the weave before the damage became irreparable. When reincarnated as Mystra, she used the form of a peasant girl learning the basics of cantra magic but with the capacities for archwizardry. She recreated the weave of magic with a few more rules, and no spell above 9th level would function. Priests and priestesses of the new goddess of magic were told the story of Karsus in dreams and visions when they prayed for spells. It was Mystra's attempt to make sure that nothing like this ever happened again. Yet Karsus was accredited as being the only human to have ever achieved godhood through spellcasting, even if it was only for a fleeting moment. Mystra's Chosen Mystra installed the mortal Azuth as the first magister, a position created specifically to recognize her most promising mortal pupil. With the help of Mystra, who had become his lover, Azuth finally ascended to divine status, and also enslaved Savras and Velsharoon. Mystra told Azuth at about the time of the Year of the Rising Flame (0 DR) that some of her divine power must be given into mortals, which would slumber within them, so that Mystra could call on it only with their permission. It would serve to help them heal quickly and would stretch their years into virtual immortality, but otherwise it would avail them little. The Chosen might gain some special powers, but these would still be far less than those of a deity. The Goddess of All Magic accordingly appeared to a few mortals she considered suitable, first in dream visions and then directly, and ultimately invested part of her divine power (known as the Silver Fire) in them. Elminster (who was trained by Mystra personally in the form of one of her own priestess named Myrjala), and Khelben Blackstaff, were two of the first. Daughters of Mystra It soon became clear to Mystra that most mortals were not tough enough to carry divine power. They either soon withered and died, burnt out by the load they carried, like the elfqueen Aloevan of Ardeepor, or they thrived but were twisted and corrupted by their power, like the mage Sammaster, who began to think of himself as a god and set about building himself a cult of worshippers (which survives today as the Cult of the Dragon). Thus Mystra proceeded to breed her own children, known as the Seven Sisters through the possessing of the Half-Elf Elu√© Shundar and mating with Dornal Silverhand. Elu√©/Mystra and Dornal were wed in the Year of Drifting Stars (760 DR). The happy couple had a daughter, Anastra Sylun√©, the following winter (the Year of Laughter, 761 DR), and six other daughters followed one per winter: Endue Alustriel in the Year of the Snow Sword (762 DR); Ambara Dove in the Year of the Sharp Edge (763 DR); Ethena Astorma (later known as Storm Silverhand) in the Year of Mistmaidens (764 DR); Anamanu√© Laeral in the Year of the Cowl (765 DR); Alassra Shentrantra, who is known today only as the Simbul in the Year of the Yearning (766 DR), and Qilu√© Er√©sseae in the Year of the Awakening Wyrm (767 DR). (However, it was written in p. 7 that Sammaster's year of birth was on or near 800 DR, which was after the seven, and in p. 8 He then became the first mage to become one of the Chosen of Mystra since the Seven Sisters many years before. These could mean that her failed relationship/mentorship with Sammaster had nothing to do with her decision to breed the Seven.) ===Third Incarnation=== At the end of the Time of Troubles, Midnight was bestowed Mystra's godhood and portfolio by Ao. Midnight adopted Mystra's name in order to make peace with her worshippers, and named her mortal friend Adon, a former cleric of Sune, as her head of church. At this time Mystra's stated alignment shifted from Lawful Neutral, maintaining the balance in use of magic, to Neutral Good, reflecting the mortal's attitudes towards the uses and purpose of magic. Midnight/Mystra retained her home among the clockwork planes of Mechanus. She remained aided in her work by Azuth and Elminster. In the Avatar Series, Mystra was revealed to be a uniquely powerful being. In Shadows of the Avatar, she is described as more powerful than any god (save Ao). The major catch is that roughly half of Mystra's power lies in her Chosen and in the Lesser Power Azuth; Ao arranged things this way so that Mystra would not rule all Realmspace. While Mystra might be the most powerful god, that doesn't save her from Cyric and Shar, in the year 1385, when the two group together to kill her in her own realm of Dweomerheart, destroying it utterly, and ruining several smaller realms and lesser deities, as said in the final entry in The Grand History of the Realms. ===Death=== Murdered by Cyric in the Year of Blue Flame (1385 DR), Mystra is no longer a part of the Forgotten Realms pantheon. The weave that she controlled and oversaw from her plane, Dweomerheart, burst - as did its counterpart the Shadow Weave. This resulted in the Spellplague spreading across the cosmos. ===Fourth Incarnation=== Mystra returned to the Forgotten Realms in 1479 DR. A vestige of Mystra had survived her death in 1385 DR, and was guiding her Chosen to aid in her renewal. The Simbul was tasked to close multiple rifts in the Weave and between realms. In doing this task, she absorbed much Silverfire and Blue Flame. The Simbul gifted all of that energy to Elminster, who in turn freely returned it to Mystra in a cave within the King's Forest of Cormyr. This new Mystra was a combination of the memories of Mystra and Midnight/Mystra, and presumably of Mystryl as she had drawn her memories from the Weave rather than from personal experience. Mystra's return was highlighted as part of the Dungeons & Dragons Encounters adventure War of Everlasting Darkness by Wizards of the Coast in 2012. She assisted the adventurers in defeating Lolth and her efforts to plunge Faerun into everlasting darkness, which would have allowed the drow to invade and conquer the surface realms. ==Relationships== Mystra's greatest enemies are Shar, who created the Shadow Weave in response to Sel√ªne's creation of Mystryl and the birth of the Weave, and Cyric, who was a mortal along with Mystra and Kelemvor (with whom Mystra had a cold friendship). She was served directly by the Lesser Power Azuth (who was killed during the Spellplague), and indirectly by demipowers Savras and Velsharoon. Mystra also had powerful mortal servants in her Chosen including Elminster, Khelben Arunsun and the Seven Sisters. ==Orders== *Order of the Starry Quill The Starry Quill is an order of Mystran bards who often work as information gatherers and rumormongers for the church or spend part of their time in designated libraries unearthing magical knowledge and then preserving it for posterity. *Order of the Shooting Star The Church of Mystra sponsors an order of rangers, known as the Order of the Shooting Star. These rangers receive their spells from Mystra. They serve as long-range scouts and spies for the church and also deal with magical threats that threaten the natural order of things, such as unloosed tanar'ri and baatezu and creatures born of irresponsible wizardly experimentation. *Knights of Mystic Fire The Church of Mystra sponsors a knightly order of paladins, the Knights of the Mystic Fire, who are granted their spells by Mystra. They often accompany members of the clergy on quests to locate lost hoards of ancient magic and also form the cadre from which the leadership for the small groups of armed forces who guard Mystra's larger temples and workshops is drawn. ==References== ==External links== * Sneak Peek: Mystra * History of the Chosen of Mystra ==Further reading== *Grubb, Jeff, Kate Novak, David E.

He is notable for discovering the Kerguelen Islands, and for authoring books about expeditions and about French naval operations during the American War of Independence. Welcomed as a hero after his First voyage of exploration, Kerguelen fell out of favour after his Second voyage and was cashiered for violating Navy regulations. He was rehabilitated during the French Revolution. == Biography  Early life=== He was born in Landudal, Brittany. During the Seven Years' War, Kerguelen-Tr√©marec was a privateer, but without much success. === Rockall === Rockall area, published 1771 In 1767 he sailed near Rockall, or Rokol. Although he may not have approached within sight of it, or even within 150 miles, he appears to have had good information regarding it. His charted position for it was only 16 miles north of its actual position and he accurately described its appearance and the nearby Helen's Reef: \\"East of Rokol, ¬º league away, there is a submerged rock over which the water breaks\\". In 1771, he published a map of the area. === Discovery of the Kerguelen Islands === In early 1772, he was assigned command of the third French expedition sent in search of the fabled Terra Australis with the fluyts Fortune and Gros Ventre. The expedition discovered the isolated Kerguelen Islands north of Antarctica in the southern Indian Ocean and claimed the archipelago for France before returning to Mauritius. He was accompanied by the naturalist Jean Guillaume Brugui√®re. In his report to King Louis XV, he greatly overestimated the value of the Kerguelen Islands; consequently, the King sent him on a second expedition with the 64-gun Roland and the 32-gun frigate Oiseau, but was again unsuccessful in finding Terra Australis. By now, it had become clear that the Kerguelen islands were desolate and quite useless, and certainly not the Terra Australis. Upon his return, Kerguelen was court-martialed in Brest for bringing his mistress aboard, in defiance of Navy regulations. He was found guilty on 25 May 1776. === French Revolution === During the French Revolution, he was seen as a victim of the Ancien R√©gime and restored to his position, taking part in the Battle of Groix. He died in 1797 as a Rear Admiral and commander of the port of Brest. == Works == * * ==Notes, citations, and references == Notes Citations References * Category:1734 births Category:1797 deaths Category:French explorers Category:Breton people Category:People from Finist√®re Category:Explorers of Antarctica Category:18th century in Antarctica Category:18th-century explorers Category:French military personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars ","title":"Yves-Joseph de Kerguelen-Tr√©marec"},{"id":"821993","text":"cover of the book \\"Tableau Encyclop√©dique et Methodique des Trois R√®gnes de la Nature\\" Jean Guillaume Brugui√®re (1749‚Äì1798) was a French physician, zoologist and diplomat.

She was accepted into the University of Puerto Rico and later to Columbia University in New York, where she graduated in 1931. She was married to painter Rafael Palacios from 1931 to 1935 and during this marriage they had two children: Carmen Palacios Mendoza and Rafael Palacios Mendoza. She returned to Puerto Rico to begin her career as a teacher, writer and newspaper columnist. In 1935, she would meet Mu√±oz Mar√≠n during one of his campaign stops in Naguabo. Although he was married to American writer Muna Lee, Mu√±oz Mar√≠n would move in with her a few years afterwards. They were married on November 16, 1946, a day after his divorce from Muna Lee was finalized. Their marriage produced two daughters, Viviana Mu√±oz Mendoza and Victoria Mu√±oz Mendoza.

In 1748 he was called to the University of G√∂ttingen to become extraordinary professor of philosophy, and in 1753 he became an extraordinary professor of law and regular professor of philosophy.

The work by which he is best known is his Staatsverfassung der Europ√§ischen Reiche im Grundrisse (Constitution of the Present Leading European States, 1752). In this work, he gave a comprehensive view of the constitutions of the various countries, described the condition of their agriculture, manufactures and commerce, and frequently supplied statistics in relation to these subjects. German economists claimed for him the title of \\"Father of Statistics\\"; but English writers disputed this, asserting that it ignored the prior claims of William Petty and other earlier writers on the subject. Achenwall gave currency to the term Staatswissenschaft (politics), which he proposed should mean all the knowledge necessary to statecraft or statesmanship. ==Publications== * Abri√ü der neuen Staatswissenschaft der vornehmen Europ√§ischen Reiche und Republiken, 1749, in the following editions titled Staatsverfassung der Europ√§ischen Reiche im Grundrisse, 1752 ff. * (with Johann Stephan P√ºtter:) Naturrecht, 1750, 1753 * Jus Naturae, 2 vol., 1755‚Äì56 ff, edition VII in 1781 with a preface from Johann Henrick Christian de Selchow. * Grunds√§tze der Europ√§ischen Geschichte, zur politischen Kenntnis der heutigen vornehmsten Staaten, 1754, 2nd edition 1759 titled Die Geschichte der heutigen vornehmsten Staaten im Grundrisse, 5th edition 1779 * Entwurf der Europ√§ischen Staatsh√§ndel des 17. und 18.

The estates (osiedla) are called Osiedle Pod Lipami (\\"Under the Lime Trees\\"), Osiedle Przyja≈∫ni (\\"Friendship\\"), Osiedle Kosmonaut√≥w (\\"Cosmonauts'\\"), Osiedle Wichrowe Wzg√≥rze (\\"Wuthering Heights\\") and Osiedle Zwyciƒôstwa (\\"Victory\\"). There is also a newer estate (Osiedle Na Murawie) to the east of the district. Wichrowe Wzg√≥rze was originally called Osiedle Kraju Rad (\\"Estate of the Land of Councils\\", referring to the Soviet Union), and Pod Lipami was called Osiedle Wielkiego Pa≈∫dziernika (\\"Estate of Great October\\", referring to the October Revolution); these were renamed after the fall of the communist regime. For city governmental purposes, the area is divided into four parts, which also called osiedla: Stare Winogrady (\\"Old Winogrady\\"), Nowe Winogrady P√≥≈Çnoc (\\"New Winogrady North\\"), Nowe Winogrady Wsch√≥d (\\"New Winogrady East\\"), and Nowe Winogrady Po≈Çudnie (\\"New Winogrady South\\"). See Administrative division of Pozna≈Ñ. The main street Aleje Solidarno≈õci (\\"Solidarity Avenue\\"), formerly ul. Serbska (\\"Serb Street\\"), runs between Przyja≈∫ni and Pod Lipami to the south, and Zwyciƒôstwa, Wichrowe Wzg√≥rze and Kosmonaut√≥w to the north. North of the latter estates is ul. Lechicka, a main transit route through Pozna≈Ñ, north of which are a number of similar estates in the neighbourhood of PiƒÖtkowo. The Plaza and Pestka shopping and entertainment complexes are located on the south side of this street, in the north of Winogrady. The Pozna≈Ñ Fast Tram Route (\\"Pestka\\") runs west of the Winogrady estates, continuing northwards to PiƒÖtkowo and southwards to the city centre. There are also older tram lines which run from the centre eastwards along ul. Winogrady and then northwards, serving the eastern parts of the district. ==References== *Winogrady housing cooperative website Category:Neighbourhoods of Pozna≈Ñ ","title":"Winogrady"},{"id":"822008","text":"These are lists of invasive species by country or region.

Its population was 22,916 (2018 est.) and its area is 3,108 km¬≤.IBGE - It is the former capital of the state and preserves much of its colonial heritage. In 2002, it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. ==World Heritage Site== It used to be the old state capital of Goi√°s up until 1937 when the government seat was transferred to the then-recently built Goi√¢nia. It was founded by the famed Bandeirante explorer Bartolomeu Bueno da Silva, nicknamed the Anhang√ºera, and was called in colonial times Vila Boa de Goyaz (\\"Good Village of Goyaz\\" in archaic Portuguese). Given its historical importance, the historical center of Goi√°s was included on the UNESCO's World Heritage list in 2001. ==Location== Municipal boundaries: *North: Faina *South: Moss√¢medes *East: Itabera√≠ *West: Itapirapu√£ and Matrinch√£ *Districts: Calcil√¢ndia, Buenol√¢ndia, David√≥polis, S√£o Jo√£o e Uv√°. *Povoado (village): S√£o Jo√£o da Lajinha. *Aglomerados (smaller than a village): Areias and Ferreiro Distances *Goi√¢nia : 148 km *Aruan√£ : 178 km *Bras√≠lia : 307 km Access can be made by highways GO-070 / Goianira / Inhumas / Itabera√≠ / BR-070.Sepin ==Geography== The topography of the municipality is characterized by rugged terrain and several rivers. The Serra Dourada Mountains are nearby. The municipality contains part of the Serra Dourada State Park, created in 2003. Waterfalls and rapids are easily accessible from the center and several of them have beaches open to the public. The most important are: *Balne√°rio Cachoeira Grande, 6 km from the city *Balne√°rio Santo Ant√¥nio, 6 km from the city *Balne√°rio Bacalhau, at the entrance to the city Rivers that cross the municipality are: *Rio Vermelho, Ur√∫, do Peixe, Ferreira and √çndio ==Political data== *Eligible voters: 17,813 (2016) *Mayor: Prof. Selma de Oliveira Bastos Pires (Workers' Party) (2013 - incumbent) *Vice-mayor: Pastor Marcia Cristina Parreira Santos (Brazilian Social Democracy Party) (2017 - incumbent) *Councilmembers: 9 ==Demographic data== *Population in 1980: 42,958 *Population in 2010: 24,727 *Population growth rate 1980/2010: approx. -42.44% *Estimated population in 2018: 22,916 ==Economy== The economy of the region is dependent on tourism, cattle raising, and agriculture. The cattle population consisted of 241,000. The main agricultural products were bananas, oranges, hearts of palm, rice (2,600 hectares), beans, corn (3,800 hectares), soybeans and wheat. ==Education and health== *Literacy rate: 85.4% *Infant mortality rate: 28.53 in 1,000 live births *Schools: 52 (2006) with 7,913 students *Higher education: UEG - Campus Cora Coralina, UFG - Regional Goi√°s *Hospitals: 1 (2019) ==History== Goi√°s circa 1903 Goi√°s Velho was founded in 1727, its name being a tribute to the Goyaz Indians, the inhabitants of the area before the arrival of the Europeans. Its houses, chapels and churches are testimony to the height of the gold rush era. The history of the town, which is intertwined with the history of Goi√°s state, and certain reminders of the wealth of past centuries carved in gold, can be seen in places such as the Museu das Bandeiras, built in 1761; the Col√©gio Sant'Ana, founded in 1879 by Dominican friars; the church of Nossa Senhora d'Abadia, constructed in 1790, with its altar painted in blue and gold; and the Casa da Fundi√ß√£o, dating from 1752, where the gold from the mines was cast. Surrounded by the Serra Dourada, Goi√°s Velho is the native city of the poet Ana Lins dos Guimar√£es Peixoto Bretas (1889-1985), better known as Cora Coralina. Although she started writing at 14 years of age, she published her first book when she was 75. In order to survive, she made and sold crystallised sweets. The house where she lived, one of the oldest in the city, dating from 1782, has become a museum, containing her furniture, personal possessions, documents and letters from illustrious correspondents such as the poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade (1902-1987) and the Bahian writer Jorge Amado, one of the main representatives of the literature of the North East region and one of the most widely read Brazilian authors both inside and outside the country. ==Festivals== In Goi√°s, one of the most popular festivals is the Procession of the Fogar√©u, which occurs on the Wednesday before Easter Sunday. It is one of the most traditional events of Holy Week in Brazil and only in Angra dos Reis is a similar procession celebrated. During the ceremony the farricocos (the people dressed in medieval robes and hoods that accompany processions of penitence) simulate Jesus' arrest by the Roman soldiers by running through the streets of the town at midnight with torches to the sound of drums. There is a great resemblance with some traditions that take place in Spain at the same time of year especially in Toledo and Sevilla. The darkness, the torches, and the speed of the men with covered faces create a medieval atmosphere. It was believed that the devil was loose in the streets of the town on that night, frightening all, especially the children. Originally, only men could participate but today that has changed. Superstitions like the presence of a werewolf and a headless mule are also manifested in this popular festival. Tourists come from far and wide to witness the spectacle. In 2006, according to the Diario da Manh√£ a newspaper from Goi√¢nia, 10,000 tourists came to watch the procession. For photos see and . Another notable festival that happens yearly in the town is the FICA (Festival Internacional de Cinema e Video Ambiental, or International Environmental Film and Video Festival). The goal of FICA is to promote, screen and award prizes to short, medium and feature- length films, in the animation, fiction or documentary genres, that address environmental themes, as well as to promote actions in production and education in the film and environmental fields. Every year the festival attracts tourists from all over the world. ==Municipal Human Development Index== *MHDI: 0.736 *State ranking: 125 (out of 242 municipalities in 2000) *National ranking: 2,283 (out of 5,507 municipalities in 2000) ==See also== * List of municipalities in Goi√°s ==References== *Frigoletto ==External links== * Site da Cidade de Goi√°s *Goi√°s, Patrim√≥nio da Humanidade * Informa√ß√µes sobre da Cidade de Goi√°s *Cidade de Goi√°s *City Brasil-Goi√°s *Fogareu Procession *Prefeitura Municipal da cidade de Goi√°s Category:Municipalities in Goi√°s Category:World Heritage Sites in Brazil Category:Populated places established in 1727 ","title":"Goi√°s, Goi√°s"},{"id":"822017","text":"Bowyer Nichols, J.

During the Arab conquest of Persia, the term became a racial pejorative. ==Etymology== According to traditional etymology, the word  øajam comes from the Semitic root  ø-j-m. Related forms of the same root include, but are not limited to: * musta øjim: mute, incapable of speech *  øajama /  æa øjama /  øajjama: to dot ‚Äì in particular, to add the dots that distinguish between various Arabic letters to a text (and hence make it easier for a non-native Arabic speaker to read). It is now an obsolete term, since all modern Arabic texts are dotted. This may also be linked to  øajƒÅm /  øajam \\"pit, seed (e.g. of a date or grape)\\". Persian painting, depicting Jamshid halved before Zahhak * in øajama: (of speech) to be incomprehensible * ista øjama: to fall silent; to be unable to speak * 'a øjam: non-fluent Homophonous words, which may or may not be derived from the same root, include: *  øajama: to test (a person); to try (a food). Modern use of \\"ajam\\" has the meaning of \\"non-Arab\\". ==Original meaning== The verb  øajama originally meant \\"to mumble, and speak indistinctly\\", which is the opposite of  øaraba, ‚Äúto speak clearly‚Äù. Accordingly, the noun  øujma, of the same root, is the opposite of fu·π£·∏•a, which means \\"chaste, correct, Arabic language\\".Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, \\"Ajam, p.700 \\" In general, during the Umayyad period ajam was a pejorative term used by Arabs who believed in their social and political superiority, in early history after Islam. However, the distinction between Arab and Ajam is discernible in pre-Islamic poetry. ==Pejorative use== During the Umayyad period, the term developed a derogatory meaning as the word was used to refer to non-Arab speakers (primarily Persians) as illiterate and uneducated. Arab conquerors in that period tried to impose Arabic as the primary language of the subject peoples throughout their empire. Angry with the prevalence of the Persian language in the Divan and Persian society, Persian resistance to this mentality was popularised in the final verse of Ferdowsi's Shahnameh; this verse is widely regarded by Iranians as the primary reason that they speak Persian and not Arabic to this day. Under the Umayyad dynasty, official association with the Arab dominion was only given to those with the ethnic identity of the Arab and required formal association with an Arab tribe and the adoption of the client status (mawƒÅlƒ´, another derogatory term translated to mean \\"slave\\" or \\"lesser\\" in this context). The pejorative use to denote Persians as \\"Ajam\\" is so ingrained in the Arab world that it is colloquially used to refer to Persians as \\"Ajam\\" neglecting the original definition and etymology of the word. ==Colloquial use== According to Clifford Edmund Bosworth, \\"by the 3rd/9th century, the non-Arabs, and above all the Persians, were asserting their social and cultural equality (taswƒ´a) with the Arabs, if not their superiority (taf≈ºƒ´l) over them (a process seen in the literary movement of the ≈†o ø≈´bƒ´ya). In any case, there was always in some minds a current of admiration for the  øA«∞am as heirs of an ancient, cultured tradition of life. After these controversies had died down, and the Persians had achieved a position of power in the Islamic world comparable to their numbers and capabilities, \\" øAjam\\" became a simple ethnic and geographical designation.\\".Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, \\"Ajam\\", Bosworth Thus by the ninth century, the term was being used by Persians themselves as an ethnic term, and examples can be given by Asadi Tusi in his poem comparing the superiority of Persians and Arabs. Jalal Khaleqi Motlaq, \\"Asadi Tusi\\", Majaleyeh Daneshkadeyeh Adabiyaat o Olum-e Insani(Literature and Humanities Magazine), Ferdowsi University, 1357(1978). page 71. Accordingly: \\"territorial notions of ‚ÄúIran,‚Äù are reflected in such terms as irƒÅn≈°ahr, irƒÅnzamin, or Faris, the Arabicized form of PƒÅrs/FƒÅrs (Persia). The ethnic notion of ‚ÄúIranian‚Äù is denoted by the Persian words PƒÅrsi or IrƒÅni, and the Arabic term Ahl Faris (inhabitants of Persia) or  øAjam, referring to non-Arabs, but primarily to Persians as in molk-e  øAjam (Persian kingdom) or moluk-e  øAjam (Persian kings).\\".Encyclopedia Iranica, \\"IRANIAN IDENTITY iii. MEDIEVAL ISLAMIC PERIOD\\" by Ahmad Ashraf According to The Political Language of Islam, during the Islamic Golden Age, 'Ajam' was used colloquially as a reference to denote those whom Arabs in the Arabian Peninsula viewed as \\"alien\\" or outsiders. The early application of the term included all of the non-Arab peoples with whom the Arabs had contact including Persians, Byzantine Greeks, Ethiopians, Armenians, Assyrians, Mandaeans, Arameans, Jews, Georgians, Sabians, Samaritans, Egyptians, and Berbers. During the early age of the Caliphates, Ajam was often synonymous with \\"foreigner\\" or \\"stranger\\". In the Western Asia, it was generally applied to the Persians, while in al-Andalus it referred to speakers of Romance languages - becoming \\"Aljamiado\\" in Spanish in reference to Arabic-script writing of those languages - and in West Africa refers to the Ajami script or the writing of local languages such as Hausa and Fulani in the Arabic alphabet. In Zanzibar ajami and ajamo means Persian which came from the Persian Gulf and the cities of Shiraz and Siraf. In Turkish, there are many documents and letters that used Ajam to refer to Persian. In the Persian Gulf region today, people still refer to Persians as Ajami, referring to Persian carpets as sajjad al Ajami (Ajami carpet), Persian cat as Ajami cats, and Persian Kings as Ajami kings.The Book.documents on the Persian gulf's name.names of Iran pp.23-60 Molk e Ajam= Persi .

Official Journal of the European Union. Accessed 2008-07-06 which has existed in Colombia since 1964. The ELN advocate a composite communist ideology of Marxism-Leninism and liberation theology. In 2013, it was estimated that the ELN forces consisted of between 1,380 and 3,000 guerrillas. According to former ELN national directorate member Felipe Torres, one fifth of ELN supporters have taken up arms. The ELN has been classified as a terrorist organization by the governments of Colombia, Peru, United States, Canada the European Union and Venezuela's National Assembly. ==History== The National Liberation Army of Colombia (Ej√©rcito de Liberaci√≥n Nacional, ELN) was founded in 1964, by Fabio V√°squez Casta√±o and other Colombian rebels trained in Cuba. Later, the ELN was headed by a series of Roman Catholic priests, exponents of Liberation Theology. Most notable was Camilo Torres Restrepo (1929‚Äì66), a well-known university professor (egalitarian and Marxist) who was openly critical of the what he considered grossly unequal income among the social classes of Colombia. His attraction to the radical ideas of Liberation Theology led him to join the ELN, a guerrilla army intent upon effecting the revolutionary praxis of liberation theology among the poor people of Colombia. Father Camilo was killed in his first combat as an ELN guerrilla, and so became the exemplar ELN soldier, to be emulated by ELN guerrillas and other liberation-theology priests from the lower ranks of the Roman Catholic priesthood. ELN guerrilla: Father Camilo Torres among the peasants of Colombia. \\"Neither Surrender, Nor Deliverance\\" reads the poster of the Ej√©rcito de Liberaci√≥n Nacional at the National University of Colombia. In the years following its foundation, it brought together more students and young activists from cities than peasants. A social composition that distinguishes it from the FARC guerrillas, who are essentially peasants. In the 1970s, after suffering military defeat and internal crises, the ELN was commanded by the Spanish priest Father Manuel P√©rez Mart√≠nez (1943‚Äì98), alias El Cura P√©rez, who shared leadership with Nicol√°s Rodr√≠guez Bautista, alias \\"Gabino\\". El Cura P√©rez presided over the National Liberation Army as one of its most recognized figures until he died of hepatitis B in 1998. He was instrumental in establishing the ideology of the ELN, a composite of Cuban revolutionary theory and liberation theology that proposes the establishment in Colombia of a Christian and communist regime to resolve the socioeconomic problems of chronic political corruption, poverty, and the exclusion of most Colombians from their country's government. The ELN guerrillas survived the heavy fighting in the Colombian Army's Operation Anor√≠ (1973‚Äì74), and then reconstituted their forces, with partial assistance from the Colombian Government of President Alfonso L√≥pez Michelsen (1974‚Äì78), who allowed the ELN to break from and escape encirclement by the Colombian National Army. President L√≥pez Michelsen helped the ELN in the hope of initiating peace negotiations with them in order to end the civil war. After this, the National Liberation Army of Colombia resumed financing its military operations by means of kidnap for ransom and the extortion of money from Colombian and foreign petroleum companies and by taxation of the private Illegal drug trade of Colombia. The ELN did not participate in the peace negotiations conducted between the Colombian government of President Andr√©s Pastrana Arango (1998‚Äì2002) and the FARC, yet did participate in an exploratory conference about possibly participating in peace negotiations. A Colombian government initiative towards granting the ELN a demilitarized zone in the southern region of the Bol√≠var Department was thwarted by right-wing political pressure from the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) whose paramilitary mercenaries conduct anti-guerrilla operations in that part of the Bol√≠var Department. == Activities == The U.S. State Department has listed the ELN as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, ostensibly because of its reputation for ransom kidnappings and armed attacks on Colombia's infrastructure. In April 2004, the European Union added the ELN to its list of terrorist organizations for those actions and its breaches of humanitarian law. The ELN has also occasionally operated with the FARC-EP and like FARC it has targeted civilians, according to a February 2005 report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights: \\"During 2004, the FARC-EP and the ELN carried out a series of attacks against the civilian population, including several massacres of civilians and kidnappings by the FARC-EP.

Only in mid-2004 the ELN and the government began to make a series of moves that, with the announced mediation of the Vicente Fox government of Mexico, lead to another round of exploratory talks. On July 24, 2004 the ELN apparently abducted Misael Vacca Ram√≠rez, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Yopal, though their reasons were not clarified. The kidnappers said that Ram√≠rez would be released with a message, but \\"Francisco Gal√°n\\", a senior jailed ELN commander who has often acted as an intermediary between the government and the ELN's high command, said he did not know whether the group was responsible. The Bishop was subsequently released by ELN members, in good health, on July 27, after his kidnapping had been condemned by Amnesty International and Pope John Paul II, among others. As far as is publicly known, he did not have any message to announce on behalf of the ELN. Eventually, the ELN questioned Mexico's participation in the talks, arguing that it did not have confidence in the actions of a government which voted against Fidel Castro's Cuba during a United Nations vote. This led the Mexican government to end its participation. ===Exploratory talks in Cuba=== In December 2005, the ELN and the Colombian government began a new round of exploratory talks in Havana, Cuba, with the presence of the ELN's military commander \\"Antonio Garc√≠a\\", as well as \\"Francisco Gal√°n\\" and \\"Ramiro Vargas\\". This was considered the direct result of three months of previous consultations with representatives of different sectors of public society through the figure of a \\"House of Peace\\" (\\"Casa de Paz\\" in Spanish). Representatives from Norway, Spain and Switzerland joined both parties at the talks as observers. The talks ended by December 22 and both parties agreed to meet again in January 2006.Colombia plans new rebel meeting.

On August 30, 2007 the ELN said that in the statement the dialogues in Havana ended without agreement because of \\"two different conceptions of peace and methods to get to it\\". ===Restored negotiations=== Colombian President √Ålvaro Uribe invited ELN Spokesman Francisco Gal√°n for new talks about peace on April 3, 2008. The two spoke in the presidential palace. After the meeting Gal√°n says the ELN will return to the negotiation table. The ELN released a press note shortly after that saying the rebel group \\"does not share the views\\" of Gal√°n and dismissed him as their spokesman. The Marxist rebels did say they will continue to let Gal√°n negotiate between the Colombian government and the rebels. On September 4, 2017, the ELN and President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia announced a truce to begin on October 1 and to last at least until January 12, 2018. From May 25 to May 29 the group had a ceasefire in order to allow for \\"favourable conditions\\" during the 2018 Colombian Presidential Election. The ELN said it hoped \\"that this spirit of conciliation of the ELN is answered with a similar behaviour\\" from the government. == Continued conflict: 2017‚Äìpresent  2019 Bogot√° car bombing === On 17 January 2019, the ELN performed a car bombing at the General Santander National Police Academy in Bogot√°, Colombia. The truck detonated and killed 21 people, including the perpetrator, and injured 68 others. It was the deadliest attack on the Colombian capital since the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing and the first attack on the capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing. The ELN accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the Colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire. As a result of the bombing, President Iv√°n Duque M√°rquez announced on 18 January that peace dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the ELN was officially suspended. Duque also demanded that Cuba extradite the ten ELN leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their Interpol Red Notices, and he criticized Venezuela for providing refuge for the ELN on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In response to the request, Cuba's Foreign Minister announced that Cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties. === 2019 Venezuelan protests === The Redes Foundation denounced in the Colombian Public Ministry that armed groups made up of National Liberation Army members and FARC dissidents, supported by the Bolivarian National Police and FAES officials, murdered two Venezuelan protesters, Eduardo Jos√© Marrero and Luigi √Ångel Guerrero, during a protest in the frontier city of San Crist√≥bal, on T√°chira state. Other protesters were injured during the shooting. === 2020 ceasefire over coronavirus === In March 2020, the National Liberation Army (ELN) declared a unilateral ceasefire during the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic. == Relations  FARC === On 26 May 2008 the ELN wrote a letter to the FARC secretariat, seeking cooperation with Colombia's largest rebel group to overcome \\"the difficulties we are experiencing in today's Colombian insurgent movement\\". The letter was published on the ELN website. On 27 June 2017, FARC ceased to be an armed group, disarming itself and handing over its weapons to the United Nations.  FARC dissidents  According to InSight Crime, the ELN and FARC dissidents allegedly met together in Venezuela to form a potential alliance in October 2018. Sources based in the Arauca department in Colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. It was also alleged that former FARC commander Iv√°n M√°rquez participated in the talks with the ELN. === Venezuela === Since the 1990s, the ELN began to establish positions in the western border states of Venezuela. The ELN grew close to Venezuelan officials during the tenure of Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez, with Ch√°vez approving relationships with the group. InSight Crime also states that Venezuelan president Nicol√°s Maduro was tolerant of the ELN, explaining that \\"ELN‚Äôs expansion in Venezuela has been marked by the Maduro administration‚Äôs inaction and even encouragement towards the group\\"; according to the group, the ELN operates in at least 12 of the 23 states of Venezuela. The Venezuelan NGO Fundaci√≥n Redes has reported that the Venezuelan military had possibly armed ELN members. In 2019, ELN supported Maduro during the Venezuelan presidential crisis and said they \\"will fight\\" US troops if they invade Venezuela.  Tupamaros  The ELN has received support from the Tupamaro movement in Venezuela, a Venezuelan colectivo and political party. The Tupamaro movement supported the ELN's dialogue with the Colombian government, stating, \\"The Tupamaro Revolutionary Movement, now more than ever, stands in solidarity with this sister organization in the historic struggle against the neo-Granadian oligarchy and Yankee imperialism.

The extended warranty may be offered by the warranty administrator, the retailer or the manufacturer. Extended warranties cost extra and for a percentage of the item's retail price. Occasionally, some extended warranties that are purchased for multiple years state in writing that during the first year, the consumer must still deal with the manufacturer in the occurrence of malfunction. Thus, what is often promoted as a five-year extended guarantee, for example, is actually only a four-year guarantee. Extended warranties have terms and conditions which may not match the original terms and conditions. For example, these may not cover anything other than mechanical failure from normal usage. Exclusions may include commercial use, \\"acts of God\\", owner abuse, and malicious destruction. They may also exclude parts that normally wear out such as tires and lubrication on a vehicle. These types of warranties are provided for various products, but automobiles and electronics are common examples. Warranties which are sold through retailers such as Best Buy may include significant commission for the retailer as a result of reverse competition.Baker T, Siegelman P. (2013). Protecting Consumers from Add-On Insurance Products: New Lessons for Insurance Regulation. For instance, an auto warranty from a car dealership may be subcontracted and vehicle repairs may be at a lower rate which could compromise the quality of service. At the time of repair, out-of-pocket expenses may be charged for unexpected services provided outside of the warranty terms or uncovered parts. == Overview == An extended warranty is coverage for electrical or mechanical breakdown. It may or may not cover peripheral items, wear and tear, damage by computer viruses, re-gassing, normal maintenance, accidental damage, or any consequential loss. Most state insurance regulators have approved the inclusion of normal wear and tear, accidental damage from handling, rental car and towing, power surge and other coverages in addition to the standard coverage for defects in materials and workmanship. The indemnity is to cover the cost of repair and may include replacement if deemed uneconomic to repair. It is important for consumers to read and understand the terms and conditions offered at the point of sale. In retail consumer electronics, extended warranties cost 20% to 30% of the price, and give sales associates up to 15% commission at some retailers.\\"Extended warranties: A deal or dud?\\" article from CBC Marketplace\\"Extended Warranty Pricing\\" from WarrantyWeek.com Consumer advocate groups, such as the non- profit Consumers Union, advise against purchasing extended warranties unless they can be purchased at manufacturers cost. David Butler of the Consumers Union says, \\"The extended warranty is definitely in the best interest of the company because if the product breaks down they want you to be satisfied with it and buy another one when the time comes, but isn't often in the best interest of the consumer unless it can be purchased at cost with no or very little markup.\\" Consumers Union said in 2006 that only two products deserved extended warranty consideration: projection TVs and digital cameras, as both are expensive to repair and require frequent repairs.\\"Skip extended warranties, Consumers Union urges\\" from CBC News In spite of such advice, consumers frequently purchase extended warranties because they overestimate the frequency of failure. == Extended auto warranty == All new cars in the United States come with a warranty that cover repairs for a certain period of time and a certain number of miles, such as 3 years and 36,000 miles. An extended warranty provides similar coverage beyond those time or mileage limits. Legally, only the original manufacturer can \\"extend\\" a warranty. Other providers often use the term \\"extended warranty\\" to refer to similar products, although technically they should be considered Vehicle Service Contracts rather than \\"warranties.\\" According to the Automobile Protection Association (APA), which publishes the Lemon-Aid Car Buyer‚Äôs Guides, extended warranties or vehicle service contracts are a good idea if they cover items likely to break down within the coverage period. Extended auto warranties often offer other perks not included in a general factory warranty, such as trip interruption insurance and roadside assistance. Auto warranties generally do not cover vandalism or theft, dings or dents, road salt damage, environmental or natural disaster-related damage. car wash damage, or normal routine maintenance. Most vehicle service contracts are sold at car dealerships at the time the vehicle is sold, although other providers offer them outside the dealership, often at lower prices. == By region  Canadian province of Qu√©bec === Based upon the Qu√©bec civil code and the Loi sur la protection du consommateur every merchant is responsible to uphold the legal guarantee of a product. This legal guarantee protects the consumer from: purposefully hidden malfunctions, defaults that could not be readily identified at the moment of purchase, the guarantee that the item purchased can be used for its stated uses and finally guarantees a reasonable life expectancy based on the price paid. This guarantee survives even when the initial purchaser sells his goods to another person. A merchant cannot ask a consumer to pay any fees or shipping charges in order to be eligible to receive their legal guarantee. The office for the protection of consumers does not take a particular stance towards extended warranties. However, they recommend that consumers should be vigilant and question themselves whether the warranty really adds anything to the already applicable legal warranty. Finally they point out that the number of consumers who go to court against merchants in order for them to apply the legal warranty is almost proportional to the number of consumers who take legal means against a merchant for failing to respect extended warranties they have sold.Office de la protection du consommateur === United States === In the United States, extended warranties are regulated by many state insurance commissioners as \\"service contracts.\\" Service contracts can cover automobiles, consumer goods (such as appliances, electronics, lawn equipment, etc...) and homes. The regulatory structure requires licensure or registration of the warranty providers, financial solvency regulation, and service contract consumer disclosures. Service warranty \\"providers\\" apply for licensure or registration, and then may sell their products, usually at the point of sale of the product, for example at the car dealership, or at the retail consumer electronics store, but some companies such as After, Inc, SquareTrade, Warranty Direct and Motoreasy also sell directly to consumers. In the United States, a type of extended warranty called vehicle service contracts are typically regulated by the states as insurance. In July 0, California issued a cease and desist letter to several corporations which were selling the insurance illegally in the state; the corporations contended that it was not insurance because the contracts required that certain additives be used.Commissioner Poizner Orders Vehicle Warranty Company to End Illegal Telemarketing, Stop Operating as Unlicensed Insurance Company. California Department of Insurance. The Service Contract Industry Council was founded by Fredrick D. Schaufeld and Bernie Schermer in 1988 and is a trade association of members of the industry. === United Kingdom === The extended warranty market has been subject to several investigations. In 2002 the Office of Fair Trading decided that self-regulation of the industry had failed and passed the case onto the Competition Commission. This concluded that the market was not acting in the interests of consumers. The Citizens Advice Bureau have expressed concerns about extended warranties being mis-sold. The Office of Fair trading investigated the extended warranty market again and published a market review in 2012. They said that the UK market is worth an estimated ¬£1billionThe OFT has completed a market study of extended warranties which highlighted competition concerns in the ¬£1 billion per year extended warranties market. a year. Out of this ¬£1billion they estimate 75% of people do not compare prices before buying an extended warranty. == See also == * Warranty * Extended service plan == References == == External links == * Consumer Information on extended warranties for cars * Extended Warranties, page on the BBC UK website Category:Contract law Category:Insurance ","title":"Extended warranty"},{"id":"822036","text":"Rocky landscape with staffage figures Lucas AchtschellinckVariant spellings of last name: Achtschellincks, Achtschellinckx, Achtschellincx, Aghtschellinx (baptized 16 January 1626 - buried 12 May 1699), was a Flemish landscape painter.

There is still some uncertainty about whether Achterschellinck painted larger format works. Dune landscape Some large non-marked works (such as the works in the Groeningemuseum, Bruges) have been attributed to the artist. A scholar has reported seeing a photograph of a signed example in a private collection, but this has not resolved conclusively the issue of the attributions of such large-scale works. These large format works are very close to works by Lodewijk de Vadder and Jacques d'Arthois and may therefore now be in collections where they have been attributed to these other artists. There are a number of landscapes with a clear stylistic relationship that are attributed to the artist. Characteristic features of his style are the broad brush stroke, especially in the depiction of roads, verges and trees. Similarly, the subtle silvery gradation of light and shade on tree trunks, and especially birches, is a recurring characteristic in the style of landscapes attributed to Achtschellinck.Lucas Achtschellinck, Boslandschap at vlaamsekunstcollectie Achtschellinck was a follower of Rubens' style of landscape painting and was also influenced by Jacques d'Arthois. He painted large wooded sceneries for churches and cloisters, which were then garnished by others with biblical characters and events. Achtschellinck painted the landscapes in many of the works of the Antwerp painter Gaspar de Crayer (1582‚Äì1669). Extensive landscape with figures Lucas Achtschellinck was among the leading Brussels landscape artists of his time. His presumed second teacher Lodewijk de Vadder (1605‚Äì1655) and Jacques d'Arthois (1603‚Äì1686) were other prominent Brussels landscape artists.Lowys de Vadder biography in: Arnold Houbraken, De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen, 1718 Lucas Achtschellinck is seen as part of the group of landscape painters active in Brussels which also included Lodewijk de Vadder, Jacques d'Arthois, Philip van Dapels and Cornelis Huysmans who often depicted the woods and sand banks in the Sonian Forest near Brussels. They are for this reason referred to as the School of Painters of the Sonian Forest. Lucas Achtschellinck also produced cartoons for the Brussels tapestry workshops.Guy Delmarcel, Flemish Tapestry from the 15th to the 18th Century, Lannoo Uitgeverij, 1 January 1999, p. 314 Together with Pieter Bout, Victor Honor√© Janssens, Peter Ykens and Lodewijk van Schoor, he designed models for large tapestry series including six models each for the series Dido and Aeneas, Perseus and Andromeda and for Teniers tapestries. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish landscape painters Category:1626 births Category:1699 deaths Category:Members of the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke ","title":"Lucas Achtschellinck"},{"id":"822042","text":"Apis (; Ancient Greek: ·ºåœÄŒπœÇ derived from apios \\"far-off\\" or \\"of the pear- tree\\"\\"Apis is the noun formed from apios, a Homeric adjective usually meaning ‚Äòfar off‚Äô but, when applied to the Peloponnese (Aeschylus: Suppliants), ‚Äòof the pear-tree‚Äô\\" as cited in Robert Graves' The Greek Myths) is the name of a figure, or several figures, appearing in the earliest antiquity according to Greek mythology and historiography. It is uncertain exactly how many figures of the name Apis are to be distinguished, particularly due to variation of their genealogies. A common element is that an Apis was an early king in the Peloponnesus that had a territory named after himself, and that Apis was often, but not always, ascribed an Egyptian origin. For the sake of convenience, the variant myths are presented here as if they dealt with separate characters. * Apis, king of Argos. He was a son of Phoroneus by the nymph Teledice, and brother of Niobe. During his reign he established a tyrannical government and called the Peloponnesus after his own name Apia, but was eventually killed in a conspiracy headed by Thelxion, king of Sparta, and Telchis.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2.1.1 * Apis, king of Sicyon appears in a Sicyonian genealogical myth. Briefly, he belonged to a legacy of primeval kings of Sicyon which is as follows: Aegialeus - Europs - Telchis - Apis - Thelxion - Agyreus - Thurimachus - Leucippus. Like the Argive Apis, he too was said to have had Peloponnesus named Apia after him.Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 2.5.6-7 * Apis, according to AeschylusAeschylus, Suppliant Women 249-70 was a seer and healer and a son of Apollo. In The Suppliants, the Argive king Pelasgus, son of Palaechthon, relates that Apis once came from Naupactus and freed Argos from throngs of snakes, which \\"Earth, defiled by the pollution of bloody deeds of old, had caused to spring up\\" and plague the country. Apis \\"worked the cure by sorcery and spells to the content of the Argive land\\". To commemorate his deed, the relieved territory was henceforth referred to as \\"the Apian land\\" (Apia kh≈çra) after his name. Note that \\"the Apian land\\" appears to comprise not just Argos: Pelasgus describes his kingdom as stretching so far as the northernmost boundaries of Greece, and comprising the territories of Paeonia and Dodona. * Apis, son of Jason. He was a native of Pallantium, Arcadia. He participated in the funeral games of Azan and was accidentally killed by Aetolus, who ran him over with the chariot. For the murder, Aetolus was sent into exile by the children of Apis.Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 5.1.8 Apollodorus relates the same of Apis, son of Phoroneus, apparently confounding the two mythological namesakes.Pseudo- Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 1.7.6 == Notes == == References == * Aeschylus, translated in two volumes. 2.

Here the ruling of the Sunnah and the Qur'an may be used as a means to solve or provide a response to a new problem that may arise. This, however, is only the case providing that the set precedent or paradigm and the new problem that has come about will share operative causes (,  øillah). The  øillah is the specific set of circumstances that trigger a certain law into action. An example of the use of qiyƒÅs is the case of the ban on selling or buying of goods after the last call for Friday prayers until the end of the prayer stated in the . By analogy this prohibition is extended to other transactions and activities such as agricultural work and administration. Among Sunni Muslim in recent centuries Qiyas has been accepted as a fundamental source of Sharia law along with IjmƒÅ ø and secondary to the Qur'an, and the Sunnah. ==Sunni interpretations== Late and modern Sunni jurisprudence regards analogical reason as a fourth source of Islamic law, following the Qur'an, prophetic tradition and binding consensus.

Imam Bukhari, Ahmad bin Hanbal, and Dawud al-Zahiri for example, rejected the use of analogical reason outright, arguing that to rely on personal opinion in law-making would mean that each individual would ultimately form their own subjective conclusions.Chiragh Ali, pg. 281. Bernard G. Weiss, one of today's foremost experts on Islamic law and philosophy, explains that while analogical reason was accepted as a fourth source of law by later generations, its validity was not a foregone conclusion among earlier Muslim jurists.Bernard G. Weiss, The Search for God's Law: Islamic Jurisprudence in the Writings of Sayf al-Din al- Amidi, pg. 633. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1992. Thus, while its status as a fourth source of law was accepted by the majority of later and modern Muslim jurists, this was not the case at the inception of Muslim jurisprudence as a field. Opposition to qiyas came from a number of angles. Professor Wal√Æd b. Ibr√¢h√Æm al-\`Ujaj√Æ Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University explains the opposition to qiyas as coming from multiple angles: :Some of them argued that qiy√¢s is contrary to reason. One argument given in this light was that: ‚ÄúDelving into this method is intellectually repugnant in its own right‚Äù. Another argument was: ‚ÄúIslamic legal rulings are based on human well-being, and no one knows human well-being except the One who gave us the sacred law. Therefore, the only way we can know the sacred law is from the revelation.‚Äù Other scholars said that qiy√¢s is not contrary to reason, but prohibited by the sacred law itself. Scott Lucas, when mentioning Ahmad Dallal‚Äôs position on Salafism, states that Dallal: :...declared that Salafism \\"is better understood as a method of thinking of, or an approach to, authoritative sources than as a distinct school of thought\\" that includes the elevation of the Qur‚Äôan and sound hadith at the expense of the opinions attributed to the eponyms of the four Sunni schools and the rejection (or sever curtailment) of qiyas  Imam Bukhari  Imam Bukhari maintained a negative position towards qiyas, as he held views aligned with the Zahiris of his time. Scott Lucas states that Bukhari‚Äôs rejection of qiyas was placed within the context of what Bukhari perceived as invalid techniques of ijtihad, which included religious innovation (bid‚Äôa), ra‚Äôy, and tamthil. Lucas also points out common mistakes other scholars make when analyzing Bukhari‚Äôs position on qiyas. The biggest source of confusion for scholars is the fact that, while rejecting qiyas, Bukhari accepts the idea of tashbih (comparison), which seems similar to analogy. However, this is not the case, as tashbih is a comparison used in explanation (such as a metaphor), whereas qiyas applies a specific legal ruling to another case. Bukhari is also known for his criticism of those who say that the Prophet used qiyas, and he devoted a section of his Sahih to the topic. Bukhari states: :If the Prophet was asked about something about which he had not received a revelation, he either said, ‚ÄòI do not know‚Äô or did not reply until he received a revelation. he did not [reply] by means of ra‚Äôy or qiyas, due to the [Qur‚Äôanic] verse, \\"‚Ä¶in accordance to what God has shown you\\" (4:105).  Ahmad Ibn Hanbal  On Ahmad's views, Christopher Melchert states ‚ÄúAhmad and his fellow traditionalists of the ninth century expressly condemned the Hanafi exercise of qiyas‚Ä¶‚Äù When compared with Dawud al-Zahiri's intensely negative stance towards qiyas, Melchert also states ‚ÄúAhmad ibn Hanbal could likewise be quoted, as we have seen, in total rejection of ra‚Äôy (opinion) and qiyas (analogy).\\" Ahmad ibn Hanbal has been quoted as saying \\"There is no qiyas in the Sunnah, and examples are not to be made up for it‚Äù  Support for its validity  Early support for the validity of analogical reason in jurisprudence came from Abu Hanifa and his student Abu Yusuf. Al-Shafi'i was a proponent of analogical reasoning as well, though his usage was less frequent than that of Abu Hanifa. Acceptance of analogical reason gradually increased within the Muslim world. With the Malikite and Hanbalite schools eventually granting full acceptance as the Hanafites and Shafi'ites already had done, the overwhelming majority of Sunni jurists from the late period onward affirmed its validity. Japanese scholar of Islam Kojiro Nakamura defined the orthodox Sunni schools in regard to their eventual acceptance of analogy in descending order of that acceptance: Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi'is, Hanbalis and Zahiris. Much work was performed on the details of proper analogy, with major figures such as Al-Qastallani, Al- Baqillani, Al-Juwayni and al-Amidi from the Shafi'ite school and Ibn Abidin from the Hanafite school providing rules and guidelines still used to this day. ===Application as a source of law=== Sunni scholar Baghawi gave a commonly accepted definition of analogy in Islamic law: analogical reasoning is the knowledge by which one learns the method of deriving a ruling from the Quran and prophetic tradition. In this case, the above-mentioned ruling should not already be apparent in the Quran, prophetic tradition or consensus. If there is no derivation involved due to the explicitness of the ruling in the Quran and prophetic tradition, then such a person is not, by definition, a mujtahid. ==Shi‚Äôa interpretations== Not unlike the Sunni Hanbalis and Zahiris, the Shi‚Äôa rejected both pure reason and analogical reason completely on account of the multitude of perspectives that would arise from it, viewing both methods as subjective. There are various instances in which the Qur'an disapproves of a divergence of beliefs such as the following: ===Twelver Shi‚Äôa=== Within the Twelver Shi‚Äôi legal tradition, the fourth source for deriving legal principles is not qiyƒÅs but rather the intellect ‚Äô‚Äô'Aql‚Äô‚Äô. Twelver Shi‚Äôa regard the ulama (scholars) as authorities in legal and religious matters during the Occultation (ghayba) of the Imamah Mahdi. Until the return of the hidden Imam, it is the responsibility of the ulƒÅma‚Äô to be his deputies and provide guidance on worldly matters. In modern interpretations of Twelver Shi‚Äôism, the most revered and learned scholars are styled as references for emulation (marja taqlƒ´d). This system of deriving legal principles effectively replaces both the Sunni notion of consensus (ijmƒÅ‚Äô) and deductive analogy (qiyƒÅs)Elhadj, Elie. The Islamic Shield: Arab Resistance to Democratic and Religious Reforms (Boca Raton: Brown Walker Press), 2007, p.48. Accordingly, in the chapter on Knowledge of the Twelver collection of prophetic traditions, Kitab al-Kafi, one finds many traditions cited from the Imams that forbid the use of qiyƒÅs, for example: ===Ismaili Shi‚Äôa=== Among the most notable Ismaili thinkers, Bu Ishaq Quhistani regarded the notion of subjective opinion (qiyƒÅs) as completely contradictory to the Islamic notion of tawhƒ´d (unity) as it ultimately gave rise to a countless divergent conclusions, besides which those who exercised deductive analogy relied on little more than their imperfect individual intellects. According to Bu Ishaq, there must be a supreme intellect in every age, just as Muhammad was in his time. Without this, it would be impossible for any ordinary individual to attain knowledge of the Divine using mere speculation. The supreme intellect, he reasoned, could be none other than the Imam of the age.Shafique Virani. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, p.149. Bu Ishaq Quhistani referred to the Qur'anic tale of Adam and Eve to support his argument for the necessity of a perfect teacher who could provide spiritual edification (ta‚Äôlƒ´m) in place of what he felt were subjective whims and wayward personal opinions (ra‚Äôy). Commenting on the Qur'anic foundational narrative, Bu Ishaq explains that when God taught Adam the names of all things, Adam was commanded to teach the angels, as in sura 2 (Al-Baqara), ayah 33. Spiritual instruction therefore had its root in the Qur'an itself, however Satan, in his arrogance, refused to bow down before Adam. Instead he protested, \\"I am better than he. You created me from fire and him from clay.\\" Thus the first to use deductive analogy was none other than Satan himself, by reasoning and challenging the command of God to prostrate. It was for this reason that Satan was punished for eternity and fell from favor until the final day.Virani, p.152. In Ismaili thought, therefore, the truth lay not in subjective opinion (ra‚Äôy) and analogy (qiyƒÅs), but rather in the teaching of the bearer of truth (muhiqq), that is, the Imam of the time. The supreme teacher therefore exists at all times for the imperfect human intellects to submit (taslƒ´m) to, as is proclaimed in the divine dictate: ==Mu'tazilite interpretations== Primarily being a school of theology and not jurisprudence, the Mu'tazila generally did not hold independent positions on such issues. The majority of the Mu'tazila, despite being a distinct sect from both Sunni and Shi'ite Islam, still preferred the juristic school of Abu Hanifa, with a minority following Al-Shafi'i's views. This resulted in the odd combination of being Mu'tazilite in creed but Sunni in jurisprudence, and consequently most of the Mu'tazila accepted analogical reason in addition to pure reason.Joseph A. Kechichian, A mind of his own. Gulf News: 21:30 December 20, 2012. Mu'tazilite scholar Abu'l Husayn al-Basri, a major contributor to early Muslim jurisprudence, said that in order for a jurist to perform analogical reason, they must possess a thorough knowledge of the rules and procedures for which allows the application of revealed law to an unprecedented case, in addition to basic knowledge of the Qur'an and prophetic tradition. Not all of the Mu'tazila followed Sunni jurisprudence. Al-Nazzam in particular denied the validity of analogical reason wholesale, preferring to rely on pure reason instead. == Qiyas and the Inquisition (Mihna) == The Inquisition that took place in the middle of the 9th century, which was initiated by the caliph al-Ma‚Äômun, ensured the persecution of many scholars who did not agree with the caliph‚Äôs rationalistic views. The most famous of these persecuted scholars is Ahmad ibn Hanbal, who maintained his view that the Qur'an was not created, but eternal. Wael Hallaq argues that the Mihna was not just about whether or not the Qur'an was created. The issues of ra‚Äôy, qiyas, and rationalism were all represented within the Inquisition, and Hallaq states ‚ÄúThe Mihna thus brought to a climax the struggle between two opposing movements: the traditionalists, whose cause Ibn Hanbal was seen to champion; and the rationalists, headed by the caliphs and the Mu‚Äôtazilites, among whom there were many Hanafites‚Äù Christopher Melchert similarly argues that the Mihna demonstrated a relationship between the Hanafis of Baghdad, who were associated with the heavy use of qiyas, and the Mu‚Äôtazilites. ==Historical debate== Before the Middle Ages there was a logical debate among Islamic logicians, philosophers and theologians over whether the term qiyas refers to analogical reasoning, inductive reasoning or categorical syllogism. Some Islamic scholars argued that qiyas refers to inductive reasoning, which Ibn Hazm (994-1064) disagreed with, arguing that qiyas does not refer to inductive reasoning, but refers to categorical syllogism in a real sense and analogical reasoning in a metaphorical sense. On the other hand, al-Ghazali (1058‚Äì1111) and Ibn QudƒÅmah al-Maqdƒ´sƒ´ (1147-1223) argued that qiyas refers to analogical reasoning in a real sense and categorical syllogism in a metaphorical sense. Other Islamic scholars at the time, however, argued that the term qiyas refers to both analogical reasoning and categorical syllogism in a real sense.Wael Hallaq (1993), Ibn Taymiyya Against the Greek Logicians, p. 48.

He was educated at the New Academy and afterwards at the Marischal College, in Aberdeen, where his father was manager of the Commercial Bank. After attending classes at Edinburgh University (1825‚Äì1826), Blackie spent three years at Aberdeen as a student of theology. In 1829 he went to Germany, and after studying at G√∂ttingen and Berlin (where he came under the influence of Heeren, M√ºller, Schleiermacher, Neander and B√∂ckh) he accompanied Bunsen to Italy and Rome. The years spent abroad extinguished his former wish to enter the Church, and at his father's desire he gave himself up to the study of law. He had already, in 1824, been placed in a lawyer's office, but only remained there six months. By the time he was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates (1834) he had acquired a strong love of the classics and a taste for letters in general. A translation of Goethe's Faust, which he published in 1834, met with considerable success, winning the approbation of Carlyle. After a year or two of desultory literary work he was (May 1839) appointed to the newly instituted chair of Humanity (Latin) in the Marischal College. Difficulties arose in the way of his installation, owing to the action of the Presbytery on his refusing to sign unreservedly the Confession of Faith; but these were eventually overcome, and he took up his duties as professor in November 1841. In the following year he married. From the first his professorial lectures were conspicuous for the unconventional enthusiasm with which he endeavoured to revivify the study of the classics; and his growing reputation, added to the attention excited by a translation of Aeschylus which he published in 1850, led to his appointment in 1852 to the professorship of Greek at Edinburgh University, in succession to George Dunbar, a post which he continued to hold for thirty years. He was somewhat erratic in his methods, but his lectures were a triumph of influential personality. A journey to Greece in 1853 prompted his essay On the Living Language of the Greeks, a favorite theme of his, especially in his later years; he adopted for himself a modern Greek pronunciation, and before his death he endowed a travelling scholarship to enable students to learn Greek at Athens. Scottish nationality was another source of enthusiasm with him; and in this connection he displayed real sympathy with highland home life and the grievances of the crofters. The foundation of the Celtic chair at Edinburgh University was mainly due to his efforts. In spite of the many calls upon his time he produced a considerable amount of literary work, usually on classical or Scottish subjects, including some poems and songs of no mean order. Blackie was a Radical and Scottish nationalist in politics, of a fearlessly independent type; possessed of great conversational powers and general versatility, his picturesque eccentricity made him one of the characters of the Edinburgh of the day, and a well-known figure as be went about in his plaid, worn shepherd-wise, over one shoulder and under the other, wearing a broad-brimmed hat, and carrying a big stick. In the 1880s and 1890s, he lectured at Oxford on the pronunciation of Greek, and corresponded on the subject with William Hardie. In May 1893, he gave his last lecture at Oxford, but afterwards admitted defeat, stating: \\"It is utterly in vain here to talk reasonably in the matter of Latin or Greek pronunciation: they are case- hardened in ignorance, prejudice and pedantry\\". He died at 9 Douglas Crescent in Edinburgh. He is buried in Dean Cemetery to the north side of the central path in the north section of the original cemetery. His nephew and biographer, Archibald Stodart Walker (1869-1934) is buried with him. In 1895 a plaque, designed by Robert Lorimer was erected to his memory in St Giles Cathedral.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer ==Publications== All printed by David Douglas. *Lyrical Poems (1860) *Lays of the Highlands and Islands (1872) *Horae Hellenicae (1874) *On Self-Culture, Intellectual, Physical and Moral (1874) *The Wise Men of Greece (1877) *The Wisdom of Goethe (1883) *A Song of Heroes (1890) ==Family== Blackie married Elizabeth (known as Eliza) Wyld in 1842.

(The median nerve is the yellow dot near the center. The carpal tunnel is not labeled, but the circular structure surrounding the median nerve is visible.) Phalen's maneuver is a diagnostic test for carpal tunnel syndrome by an American orthopedist named George S. Phalen. ==Technique== The patient is asked to hold their wrists in complete and forced flexion (pushing the dorsal surfaces of both hands together) for 30‚Äì60 seconds. The lumbricals attach in part to the flexor digitorum profundus tendons. As the wrists flex, the flexor digitorum profundus contracts in a proximal direction, drawing the lumbricals along with it. In some individuals, the lumbricals can be \\"dragged\\" into the carpal tunnel with flexor digitorum profundus contraction. As such, Phalen's maneuver can moderately increase the pressure in the carpal tunnel via this mass effect, pinching the median nerve between the proximal edge of the transverse carpal ligament and the anterior border of the distal end of the radius. By compressing the median nerve within the carpal tunnel, characteristic symptoms (such as burning, tingling or numb sensation over the thumb, index, middle and ring fingers) conveys a positive test result and suggests carpal tunnel syndrome. Because not all individuals will draw the lumbricals into the carpal tunnel with this maneuver, this test cannot be perfectly sensitive or specific for carpal tunnel syndrome.Urbano, F. (2000).

(Retrieved 19:15:10 UTC Monday, December 15, 2008 ==Accuracy== In studies of diagnostic accuracy, the sensitivity of the Phalen's maneuver ranged from 51% to 91% and its specificity from 33% to 88%. ==Reverse Phalen's test== Reverse Phalen's test This test is performed by having the patient maintain full wrist and finger extension for two minutes. The reverse Phalen's test significantly increases pressure in the carpal tunnel within 10 seconds of the change in wrist posture and the carpal tunnel pressure has the tendency to increase throughout the test's duration. In contrast, the change in carpal tunnel pressure noted in the standard Phalen's test is modest and plateaus after 20 to 30 seconds. The average pressure change for Phalen's test at one and two minutes was only 4 mm Hg. The average pressure changes in the carpal tunnel for the reverse Phalen's test were 34 mm Hg at one minute into the test and 42 mm Hg at the two-minute point. The extended wrist posture significantly changes the pressure within the carpal tunnel and may be more useful as a provocative examination maneuver. Reverse Phalen's maneuver results in a significantly higher intracarpal canal hydrostatic pressure as compared to a traditional Phalen's. This is thought to add to the sensitivity of conventional screening methods. ==Comparison== Phalen's maneuver is more sensitive than Tinel's sign.Cherian A, Kuruvilla A. 2006. \\"Electrodiagnostic approach to carpal tunnel syndrome.\\" Ann Indian Acad Neurol 9:177-182. ==References== Category:Musculoskeletal examination Category:Wrist ","title":"Phalen maneuver"},{"id":"822073","text":"Markyate is a village and civil parish in north-west Hertfordshire close to the border with Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. ==Geography== Having had several former name variants, including Markyate Street and Mergyate, Markyate has been part of one or other of the three counties of Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire at various times, as the county boundaries have changed over the years. At one time the boundary was the line of the main road itself: Hertfordshire to the east and Bedfordshire to the west. Markyate is close to the source of the River Ver, which has occasionally flooded the centre of the village, though the watercourse is often dry during parts of the year. Part of the Dacorum Borough Council district (centred on Hemel Hempstead), it has Luton (01582) phone numbers and a St Albans postal code (AL3). Although historically a rural and agricultural area, it is now a dormitory village for Luton and the surrounding region, as it is a short distance from the M1 motorway. Lying on Watling Street, the Roman road (subsequently the A5 until de-trunking) between St Albans and Dunstable, it was a major coaching stop on the highway from London to Birmingham, at one point having over forty inns and public houses along its main road, and the village was one of the earliest sites of the Pickfords transport service, one road out of the village being named Pickford Road. During the 12th century Christina of Markyate was the Prioress of a Benedictine community in the area. The village lies near the junction of the A5183 Watling Street (formerly A5) and the B4540 (for Luton and Caddington). A bypass for the A5 was constructed to the east of the village in 1955. South near the A5183 is Flamstead and junction 9 of the M1. ==History== Markyate first became a separate ecclesiastical parish, known as Markyate Street, in 1877; while on 30 September 1897 the civil parish of Markyate was created from the Bedfordshire civil parish of Humbershoe (created in 1866 from part of the ancient parish of Studham), the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire portions of Caddington, Flamstead, an exclave of Houghton Regis known as Buckwood Stubbs (tithe map ), including an exclave of Whipsnade, Ballington Bottom in Hertfordshire. Growth since the 1950s has been by infilling with new housing in the gap between the old High Street and the newer Markyate by-pass. In 2014 most of the village's light industry area off Hicks Road was demolished, to be replaced by new housing and shops. ==In popular culture== The Gainsborough film The Wicked Lady was based on events surrounding the life of Lady Katherine Ferrers -- the wife of the major landowner in the area - at Markyate Cell. Parts of the film The Dirty Dozen were also filmed in the village and surrounding area, the stockade being built in the grounds of the local preparatory school. ==Facilities== The Old School House, Cheverell's Green Markyate has two junior schools: Markyate JMI (state) and Beechwood Park School (independent). The latter is south-west of the village in Beechwood Park, the site of a former Benedictine nunnery. Adjacent to the park was an Army Y-station during the Second World War. Beechwood Park lent its name to a song by the Zombies, written by the group's bassist Chris White. The song has since been covered by Beck in live shows. The parish church of St John Markyate dates from the 18th century, and retains some round-arched windows from that time. Due to enlargement in the nineteenth century it now appears gothic from most directions. St John's is home to a worshipping community of the Church of England and is part of the united parish of Flamstead and Markyate.https://churchfm.org/ From its height in the coaching era, only two public houses now remain in the village: the Plume of Feathers and the Swan. The White Hart closed in the early 1970s, followed by the Red Lion at the end of 2009 and Sun Inn in 2014, all of which became private dwellings. A micro- pub 'the Local' opened within the village in 2016. Being near the M1 motorway and Luton Airport, there is a large three-star Holiday Inn hotel just south- east of the village. Markyate has four Indian restaurants including Saffron (on the A5183) plus The Pavilion, Markyate Tandoori, and Markyate Spice all on the High Street, with the latter being named Best Chef at the Curry Life Awards 2018. There has also been a fish and chips shop in the village since the 1960s. Markyate also offers a gym, a pharmacy and doctors' surgery, a general store, a hardware store, and a bakers. ==Notable residents== * Christina of Markyate, a 12th-century nun and mystic * William Cowper, who was sent to boarding school here between the ages of four and eight years old. * Lady Katherine Ferrers, according to popular legend, the \\"Wicked Lady\\", a 17th-century highwaywoman. * Nicholas Lyell, Baron Lyell of Markyate, British Conservative politician and Attorney General. * Chris White, bass player and songwriter of the Zombies rock group, grew up in the village, where his parents owned a grocery store. * Sir Charles Masefield, head of DESO (1994-1998) vice chairman of BAE (2002-2005?) and a trustee of the Qatar Foundation.

It is located three miles from the downtown area. Bloomfield is sometimes referred to as Pittsburgh's Little Italy because it was settled by Italians from the Abruzzi region and has been a center of Italian‚ÄìAmerican population. Pittsburgh architectural historian, Franklin Toker, has said that Bloomfield \\"is a feast, as rich to the eyes as the homemade tortellini and cannoli in its shop windows are to the stomach.\\" Recently, the neighborhood has as attracted young adults and college students as a \\"hip\\" neighborhood.Bill Toland, \\"Watch out Portland, Pittsburgh's lookin' hip\\", Post-Gazette, 15 January 2012; accessed 3 June 2016 ==Location== Bloomfield is a plateau above the Allegheny River; it is bordered by Penn Avenue on the north, the East Busway on the south, 40th Street on the west, and Gross Street on the east. This last boundary is somewhat disputed ‚Äì many residents believe that Bloomfield abuts the neighborhood of Friendship at Gross Street. Here the provincial frame rowhouses give way to stand-alone brick Victorian homes, which were built larger on each street heading east. The City of Pittsburgh, however, claims that Bloomfield extends east as far as Graham Street. The East Busway is set into Skunk Hollow, a ravine that separates Bloomfield from Polish Hill to the west, North Oakland to the southwest, and Shadyside to the south. The neighborhoods are within sight of one another and are connected by the Bloomfield Bridge and the South Millvale Bridge, both of which span this gap. ==City Steps== The Bloomfield neighborhood has 4 distinct flights of city steps - all of which are open and in a safe condition. In Bloomfield, the Steps of Pittsburgh quickly connect pedestrians from the main residential area to the lower-elevation streets of Lorigan, Juniper, and Neville. These shady streets offer a mix of residential and industrial buildings and are popular with dog walkers, runners, and cyclists. ==History== Bloomfield does not appear to have been an independent borough prior to its annexation by the City of Pittsburgh in 1868. The land here was stolen from the native Delaware tribe by Casper Taub, one of the area's earliest European settlers. Taub sold the land to his son-in-law John Conrad Winebiddle, whose descendants divided it into lots and sold it for development beginning around the time of the 1868 annexation. The community most likely was named for the abundant blooming flowers near the original town site. In the decades following 1868, Bloomfield was settled by German Catholic immigrants, who in 1886 built St. Joseph's Church. Beginning around 1900, Italians from five towns in the Abruzzi region settled here, forming Immaculate Conception Parish in 1905 (that church was rebuilt in its present form in 1961). Descendants from both groups, with ethnic Italians outnumbering the Germans, still give the neighborhood its character today. In 2001 the national churches of St. Joseph's and Immaculate Conception were merged to form a single parish. Since the early 21st century, Bloomfield is one of the neighborhoods that has attracted young adults, including those described as creative and \\"hip.\\" Pittsburgh's affordability and ethnic history, compared to some other cities, have resulted in new residents settling here. ==Business district== The business district is concentrated along Liberty Avenue, with a variety of businesses and services. In addition to the two churches and Western Pennsylvania Hospital, the street has many restaurants and bars, a supermarket and two Italian markets, tanning and hair salons, gift and card shops, gyms, two barber shops, a cobbler, a vacuum repairman, and more. A small park beside the Bloomfield Bridge holds public bocce courts, a playground, a softball field, a skateboarding area, and a dek hockey rink. Many restaurants serve Italian cuisine, although the neighborhood also features a noted Polish restaurant [that closed in early 2018]. Two Thai and two Chinese restaurants are located on Liberty Avenue. ==Sport== Baltimore Colts' Hall of Fame quarterback, Pittsburgh native Johnny Unitas returned to this neighborhood to play. After being cut by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1955, Unitas played one season for the semipro Bloomfield Rams on Dean's Field, located under the Bloomfield Bridge. The semipro league has long since folded, and the Bloomfield Rams no longer exist. The former Dean's Field was renamed as Officer Paul J. Sciullo Memorial Field, after a policeman killed in duty. It is now part of a public recreational complex. == Images == File:Bloomfield Welcome Sign.JPGSignage on Liberty Avenue File:Baseball Field at Bloomfield Park, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.jpgThe baseball field of Bloomfield Park in the foreground, with residential dwellings in the center of the image.

Its principal services are roadside assistance and general insurance, and its subsidiaries include RAC Motoring Services Ltd, RAC Financial Services Ltd and RAC Insurance Limited. The RAC emerged as the \\"Associate Section\\" of the Royal Automobile Club founded at the turn of the 20th century, and it was incorporated as R.A.C. Motoring Services Ltd. in 1978. It was sold by the members of the Royal Automobile Club to Lex Service in April 1999, which subsequently renamed itself RAC plc. In March 2005, RAC plc was acquired by Aviva and therefore delisted. Aviva then sold the RAC to the Carlyle Group in June 2011. Although Carlyle had originally planned a stock market flotation for the RAC, in September 2014, Carlyle agreed to sell almost half its stake to Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC Private Limited. In December 2015, Carlyle agreed to sell its remaining stake to CVC Capital Partners, in an transaction valuing the RAC at ¬£1.4 billion. The RAC's main competitors are The AA and Green Flag. ==History== The RAC tower in Bradley Stoke, Bristol 1961 RAC Austin Mini Van The Royal Automobile Club was formed in 1897 by Frederick Richard Simms, which set up an \\"associate section\\" to assist members with roadside assistance and to provide motoring services. The club incorporated the associate section as R.A.C. Motoring Services Ltd. in 1978. In 1987, the organisation introduced an \\"Advanced Computer Aided Rescue System\\". In 1991, it established the RAC Foundation as its research arm. The RAC Foundation was later turned into a charity, and received a legacy from Royal Automobile Club members when R.A.C. Motoring Services Ltd. was later sold. British School of Motoring (BSM) was purchased by R.A.C. Motoring Services Ltd. in December 1998. In September 1999, R.A.C. Motoring Services was itself purchased by Lex Service from members of the Royal Automobile Club. Lex Service renamed themselves RAC plc in 2002. In October 2000, RAC purchased I/CAD from Intergraph to provide advanced graphical command and control capabilities. The National Customer Service Awards' recognized the system with the 'Best Use of Technology in Customer Service' award in October 2004. Aviva acquired RAC plc for around ¬£1.1 billion in March 2005. They went on to raise around ¬£500m from selling some parts of the business, such as RAC Auto Windscreens in December 2008, and BSM to a German company in January 2009. BSM has since been sold to Acromas Holdings which owns The Automobile Association. Aviva ceased providing loans under the RAC brand name in January 2008, and dissolved its partnership with The Co-operative Bank. Aviva sold the RAC to Carlyle Group in June 2011. ==ServicesRoadside assistance=== An RAC roadside assistance van The RAC has around 2,000 patrols that attend 2.8 million breakdowns each year, this includes overseas breakdowns with RAC Europe. The RAC covers eight million roadside assistance customers, with 2.2 million individual members and 4.5 million corporate customers. Their breakdown assistance centres operate 24/7, and deal with approximately four millions calls a year. They have introduced, for trial, two hybrid vehicles, to cut fuel consumption and carbon emissions. In May 2009, a survey by J.D. Power ranked the RAC highest in \\"satisfying roadside assistance customers\\" for the fourth consecutive year. RAC Europe is breakdown cover for customers from the United Kingdom that travel to Europe. RAC Europe covers forty seven European countries, and provides English speaking Incident Managers, available twenty four hours a day to assist. The office is based near Lyon, in Villeurbanne, France. ===Other=== RAC Vehicle Checks and Examinations conduct vehicle checks that show if a car has been stolen, written off, has outstanding finance or previous plates, is at risk of being sold illegally, and that its number plate and chassis number correspond. RAC Vehicle Checks are conducted by Experian, while RAC Examinations Inspectors make physical checks on the car to make sure it is mechanically and structurally sound. The RAC also provides travel and traffic services including online route planners, in car navigation and help with travel documents. ==Team RAC== Colin Turkington driving for Team RAC BMW at Snetterton In 2006, RAC teamed up with WSR (West Surrey Racing) to form Team RAC and to race in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) with two MG ZS cars and from 2007 onwards, two (and sometimes three) BMW E90 320si cars. The racing cars were liveried in RAC's corporate orange and have achieved a number of wins, including winning the BTCC Independent Drivers Championship with Colin Turkington in 2007, 2008 and 2009.

Essentially, they introduce a barbiturate (usually sodium amobarbital) into one of the internal carotid arteries via a cannula or intra-arterial catheter from the femoral artery. They inject the drug into one hemisphere at a time into the right or left internal carotid artery. If the right carotid is injected, the right side of the brain is inhibited and cannot communicate with the left side. The effect shuts down any language and or memory function in that hemisphere in order to evaluate the other hemisphere (\\"half of the brain\\"). An EEG recording at the same time confirms that the injected side of the brain is inactive as a neurologist performs a neurological examination. The neurologist engages the patient in a series of language and memory related tests. They evaluate the memory by showing a series of items or pictures to the patient and‚Äîwithin a few minutes, as soon as the effect of the medication dissipates‚Äîtesting the patient's ability to recall. The test is typically administered by a neuropsychologist as a result of expertise in psychometric testing. Correlation with formal neuropsychological testing has some predictive power regarding seizure outcome following anterior temporal lobectomy. There is currently great variability in the processes used to administer the test, and so it is difficult to compare results from one patient to the other. ==Uses== The test is usually performed prior to ablative surgery for epilepsy and sometimes prior to tumor resection. The aim is to determine which side of the brain is responsible for certain vital cognitive functions, namely speech and memory. The risk of post-operative cognitive change can be estimated, and depending on the surgical approach employed at the epilepsy surgery center, the need for awake craniotomies can be determined as well. The Wada test has several side-effects. Drastic personality changes are rarely noted, but disinhibition is common. Also, contralateral hemiplegia, hemineglect and shivering are often seen. During one injection, typically the left hemisphere, the patient experiences impaired speech and language or is completely unable to express or understand language. Though the patient may not be able to talk, sometimes their ability to sing is preserved. This is because music and singing uses a different part of the brain than speech and language. Recovery from the anesthesia is rapid, and EEG recordings and distal grip strength may be used to determine when the medication has worn off. Generally, recovery of speech is dysphasic (contains errors in speech or comprehension) after a language dominant hemisphere injection. Though generally considered a safe procedure, there are at least minimal risks associated with the angiography procedure that guides the catheter to the internal carotid artery, perhaps related to the physician's experience. Researchers are looking into non-invasive ways to determine language and memory laterality‚Äîsuch as fMRI, TMS, magnetoencephalography, and near-infrared spectroscopy. ==History== The Wada test is named after Canadian neurologist and epileptologist Juhn Atsushi Wada, of the University of British Columbia.Loring, D.W., Meador, K.J., Lee, G.P., King, D.W. (1992). Amobarbital Effects and Lateralized Brain Function: The Wada Test. New York: Springer- Verlag. He developed the test while he was a medical resident in Japan just after World War II, when he was receiving training in neurosurgery. Wada developed the technique of transient hemispheric anesthetization through carotid amytal injection to decrease the cognitive side effects associated with bilateral electroconvulsive therapy. He published the initial description of motor, sensory, language, and effects on the \\"conscious state\\" in 1949, in Japanese. During his fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute, he introduced the test to the English-speaking world. == Filmography == * Grey's Anatomy season 5, episode 23, Here's to Future Days: Mention of the Wada test at 00:06:13 and showing Hollywood's portrayal of the test at 00:12:31. ==See also== *Lateralization of brain function ==References== Category:Neurology procedures Category:Neuropsychology Category:Medical tests ","title":"Wada test"},{"id":"822093","text":"Runes are the letters in a set of related alphabets known as runic alphabets, which were used to write various Germanic languages before the adoption of the Latin alphabet and for specialised purposes thereafter. The Scandinavian variants are also known as futhark or fu√æark (derived from their first six letters of the alphabet: F, U, √û, A, R, and K); the Anglo-Saxon variant is futhorc or ' (due to sound-changes undergone in Old English by the names of those six letters). Runology is the study of the runic alphabets, runic inscriptions, runestones, and their history. Runology forms a specialised branch of Germanic linguistics. The earliest runic inscriptions date from around 150 AD. The characters were generally replaced by the Latin alphabet as the cultures that had used runes underwent Christianisation, by approximately 700 AD in central Europe and 1100 AD in northern Europe. However, the use of runes persisted for specialized purposes in northern Europe. Until the early 20th century, runes were used in rural Sweden for decorative purposes in Dalarna and on Runic calendars. The three best-known runic alphabets are the Elder Futhark (around 150‚Äì800 AD), the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc (400‚Äì1100 AD), and the Younger Futhark (800‚Äì1100 AD). The Younger Futhark is divided further into the long-branch runes (also called Danish, although they were also used in Norway, Sweden, and Frisia); short-branch or R√∂k runes (also called Swedish- Norwegian, although they were also used in Denmark); and the ' or H√§lsinge runes (staveless runes). The Younger Futhark developed further into the Medieval runes (1100‚Äì1500 AD), and the Dalecarlian runes ( 1500‚Äì1800 AD). Historically, the runic alphabet is a derivation of the Old Italic scripts of antiquity, with the addition of some innovations. Which variant of the Old Italic branch in particular gave rise to the runes is uncertain. Suggestions include Raetic, Venetic, Etruscan, or Old Latin as candidates. At the time, all of these scripts had the same angular letter shapes suited for epigraphy, which would become characteristic of the runes. The process of transmission of the script is unknown. The oldest inscriptions are found in Denmark and northern Germany. A \\"West Germanic hypothesis\\" suggests transmission via Elbe Germanic groups, while a \\"Gothic hypothesis\\" presumes transmission via East Germanic expansion. ==History and use== An inscription using cipher runes, the Elder Futhark, and the Younger Futhark, on the 9th-century R√∂k runestone in Sweden A Younger Futhark inscription on the 12th-century Vaksala Runestone in Sweden The runes were in use among the Germanic peoples from the 1st or 2nd century AD. This period corresponds to the late Common Germanic stage linguistically, with a continuum of dialects not yet clearly separated into the three branches of later centuries: North Germanic, West Germanic, and East Germanic. No distinction is made in surviving runic inscriptions between long and short vowels, although such a distinction was certainly present phonologically in the spoken languages of the time. Similarly, there are no signs for labiovelars in the Elder Futhark (such signs were introduced in both the Anglo-Saxon futhorc and the Gothic alphabet as variants of p; see .) The term runes is used to distinguish these symbols from Latin and Greek letters. It is attested on a 6th-century Alamannic runestaff as and possibly as on the 4th-century Einang stone. The name comes from the Germanic root (, ), meaning \\"secret\\" or \\"whisper\\". In Old Irish Gaelic, the word means \\"mystery\\", \\"secret\\", \\"intention\\" or \\"affectionate love.\\" Similarly in Welsh and Old English, the word and respectively means \\"mystery\\", \\"secret\\", \\"secret writing\\", or sometimes in the extreme sense of the word, \\"miracle\\" (). Ogham is an older Celtic script from Ireland and Britain, similarly carved in to stone or wood. The root can also be found in the Baltic languages, meaning \\"speech\\". In Lithuanian, means both \\"to cut (with a knife)\\" and \\"to speak\\". According to another theory, the Germanic root comes from the Indo-European root *' \\"dig\\".Friedrich Kluge, Etymologisches W√∂rterbuch der deutschen Sprache. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/New York 2001, The Finnish term for rune, , means \\"scratched letter\\".Nykysuomen sanakirja: \\"riimu\\" The Finnish word means \\"poem\\" and comes from the same source as the English word \\"rune\\"; it is a very old loan of the Proto-Germanic (\\"letter, literature, secret\\").H√§kkinen, Kaisa. Nykysuomen etymologinen sanakirja ===Origins=== The formation of the Elder Futhark was complete by the early 5th century, with the Kylver Stone being the first evidence of the futhark ordering as well as of the p rune. The alphabets of Este (Venetic), Magr√® and Bolzano/Bozen-Sanzeno (Raetic), Sondrio (Camunic), Lugano (Lepontic) Specifically, the Raetic alphabet of Bolzano is often advanced as a candidate for the origin of the runes, with only five Elder Futhark runes ( e, √Ø, j, ≈ã, p) having no counterpart in the Bolzano alphabet. Scandinavian scholars tend to favor derivation from the Latin alphabet itself over Raetic candidates.. A \\"North Etruscan\\" thesis is supported by the inscription on the Negau helmet dating to the 2nd century BC. This is in a northern Etruscan alphabet but features a Germanic name, . Giuliano and Larissa Bonfante suggest that runes derived from some North Italic alphabet, specifically Venetic: but since Romans conquered Veneto after 200 BC, and then the Latin alphabet became prominent and Venetic culture diminished in importance, Germanic people could have adopted the Venetic alphabet within the 3rd century BC or even earlier.G. Bonfante, L. Bonfante, The Etruscan Language p. 119 The angular shapes of the runes are shared with most contemporary alphabets of the period that were used for carving in wood or stone. There are no horizontal strokes: when carving a message on a flat staff or stick, it would be along the grain, thus both less legible and more likely to split the wood. This characteristic is also shared by other alphabets, such as the early form of the Latin alphabet used for the Duenos inscription, but it is not universal, especially among early runic inscriptions, which frequently have variant rune shapes, including horizontal strokes. Runic manuscripts (that is written rather than carved runes, such as ) also show horizontal strokes. The \\"West Germanic hypothesis\\" speculates on an introduction by West Germanic tribes. This hypothesis is based on claiming that the earliest inscriptions of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, found in bogs and graves around Jutland (the Vimose inscriptions), exhibit word endings that, being interpreted by Scandinavian scholars to be Proto-Norse, are considered unresolved and long having been the subject of discussion. Inscriptions such as , , and are supposed to represent tribe names, tentatively proposed to be Vangiones, the Nidensis, and the Harii tribes located in the Rhineland. Since names ending in reflect Germanic morphology representing the Latin ending , and the suffix was reflected by Germanic , the question of the problematic ending in masculine Proto-Norse would be resolved by assuming Roman (Rhineland) influences, while \\"the awkward ending -a of may be solved by accepting the fact that the name may indeed be West Germanic\\". In the early Runic period differences between Germanic languages are generally presumed to be small. Another theory presumes a Northwest Germanic unity preceding the emergence of Proto-Norse proper from roughly the 5th century. An alternative suggestion explaining the impossibility of classifying the earliest inscriptions as either North or West Germanic is forwarded by √à. A. Makaev, who presumes a \\"special runic koine\\", an early \\"literary Germanic\\" employed by the entire Late Common Germanic linguistic community after the separation of Gothic (2nd to 5th centuries), while the spoken dialects may already have been more diverse. ===Early inscriptions=== Ring of Pietroassa () by Henri Trenk, 1875 Runic inscriptions from the 400-year period 150‚Äì550 AD are described as \\"Period I\\". These inscriptions are generally in Elder Futhark, but the set of letter shapes and bindrunes employed is far from standardized. Notably the j, s, and ≈ã runes undergo considerable modifications, while others, such as p and √Ø, remain unattested altogether prior to the first full futhark row on the Kylver Stone ( 400 AD). Artifacts such as spear heads or shield mounts have been found that bear runic marking that may be dated to 200 AD, as evidenced by artifacts found across northern Europe in Schleswig (North Germany), Fyn, Sj√¶lland, Jylland (Denmark), and Sk√•ne (Sweden). Earlier‚Äîbut less reliable‚Äîartifacts have been found in Meldorf, S√ºderdithmarschen, northern Germany; these include brooches and combs found in graves, most notably the Meldorf fibula, and are supposed to have the earliest markings resembling runic inscriptions. Theories of the existence of separate Gothic runes have been advanced, even identifying them as the original alphabet from which the Futhark were derived, but these have little support in archaeological findings (mainly the spearhead of Kovel, with its right-to-left inscription, its T-shaped tiwaz, and its rectangular dagaz). If there ever were genuinely Gothic runes, they were soon replaced by the Gothic alphabet. The letters of the Gothic alphabet, however, as given by the Alcuin manuscript (9th century), are obviously related to the names of the Futhark. The names are clearly Gothic, but it is impossible to say whether they are as old as the letters themselves. A handful of Elder Futhark inscriptions were found in Gothic territory, such as the 3rd- to 5th-century Ring of Pietroassa. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica even suggests the original development of the runes may have been due to the Goths.. ===Magical or divinatory use=== A bracteate (G 205) from approximately AD 400 that features the charm word with a depiction of a stylized male head, a horse, and a swastika, a common motif on bracteates An illustration of the Gummarp Runestone (500‚Äì700 AD) from Blekinge, Sweden Closeup of the runic inscription found on the 6th- or 7th- century Bj√∂rketorp Runestone located in Blekinge, Sweden The stanza 157 of attribute to runes the power to bring that which is dead back to life. In this stanza, Odin recounts a spell: The earliest runic inscriptions found on artifacts give the name of either the craftsman or the proprietor, or sometimes, remain a linguistic mystery. Due to this, it is possible that the early runes were not used so much as a simple writing system, but rather as magical signs to be used for charms. Although some say the runes were used for divination, there is no direct evidence to suggest they were ever used in this way. The name rune itself, taken to mean \\"secret, something hidden\\", seems to indicate that knowledge of the runes was originally considered esoteric, or restricted to an elite. The 6th-century Bj√∂rketorp Runestone warns in Proto- Norse using the word rune in both senses: The same curse and use of the word, rune, is also found on the Stentoften Runestone. There also are some inscriptions suggesting a medieval belief in the magical significance of runes, such as the Franks Casket (AD 700) panel. Charm words, such as , , , and most commonly, , appear on a number of Migration period Elder Futhark inscriptions as well as variants and abbreviations of them. Much speculation and study has been produced on the potential meaning of these inscriptions. Rhyming groups appear on some early bracteates that also may be magical in purpose, such as and . Further, an inscription on the Gummarp Runestone (500‚Äì700 AD) gives a cryptic inscription describing the use of three runic letters followed by the Elder Futhark f-rune written three times in succession. Nevertheless, it has proven difficult to find unambiguous traces of runic \\"oracles\\": although Norse literature is full of references to runes, it nowhere contains specific instructions on divination. There are at least three sources on divination with rather vague descriptions that may, or may not, refer to runes: Tacitus's 1st-century , Snorri Sturluson's 13th-century , and Rimbert's 9th-century . The first source, Tacitus's Tacitus, Germania, 10, describes \\"signs\\" chosen in groups of three and cut from \\"a nut-bearing tree\\", although the runes do not seem to have been in use at the time of Tacitus' writings. A second source is the , where Granmar, the king of , goes to Uppsala for the . There, the \\"chips\\" fell in a way that said that he would not live long (). These \\"chips\\", however, are easily explainable as a (sacrificial chip), which was \\"marked, possibly with sacrificial blood, shaken, and thrown down like dice, and their positive or negative significance then decided.\\" The third source is Rimbert's , where there are three accounts of what some believe to be the use of runes for divination, but Rimbert calls it \\"drawing lots\\". One of these accounts is the description of how a renegade Swedish king, Anund Uppsale, first brings a Danish fleet to Birka, but then changes his mind and asks the Danes to \\"draw lots\\". According to the story, this \\"drawing of lots\\" was quite informative, telling them that attacking Birka would bring bad luck and that they should attack a Slavic town instead. The tool in the \\"drawing of lots\\", however, is easily explainable as a (lot-twig), which according to Foote and Wilson would be used in the same manner as a . The lack of extensive knowledge on historical use of the runes has not stopped modern authors from extrapolating entire systems of divination from what few specifics exist, usually loosely based on the reconstructed names of the runes and additional outside influence. A recent study of runic magic suggests that runes were used to create magical objects such as amulets, but not in a way that would indicate that runic writing was any more inherently magical, than were other writing systems such as Latin or Greek. ===Medieval use=== Codex Runicus, a vellum manuscript from approximately 1300 AD containing one of the oldest and best preserved texts of the Scanian Law, is written entirely in runes. As Proto-Germanic evolved into its later language groups, the words assigned to the runes and the sounds represented by the runes themselves began to diverge somewhat and each culture would create new runes, rename or rearrange its rune names slightly, or stop using obsolete runes completely, to accommodate these changes. Thus, the Anglo-Saxon futhorc has several runes peculiar to itself to represent diphthongs unique to (or at least prevalent in) the Anglo-Saxon dialect. Nevertheless, that the Younger Futhark has 16 runes, while the Elder Futhark has 24, is not fully explained by the 600-some years of sound changes that had occurred in the North Germanic language group. The development here might seem rather astonishing, since the younger form of the alphabet came to use fewer different rune signs at the same time as the development of the language led to a greater number of different phonemes than had been present at the time of the older futhark. For example, voiced and unvoiced consonants merged in script, and so did many vowels, while the number of vowels in the spoken language increased. From 1100 AD, this disadvantage was eliminated in the medieval runes, which again increased the number of different signs to correspond with the number of phonemes in the language. Some later runic finds are on monuments (runestones), which often contain solemn inscriptions about people who died or performed great deeds. For a long time it was presumed that this kind of grand inscription was the primary use of runes, and that their use was associated with a certain societal class of rune carvers. In the mid-1950s, however, approximately 670 inscriptions, known as the Bryggen inscriptions, were found in Bergen. These inscriptions were made on wood and bone, often in the shape of sticks of various sizes, and contained inscriptions of an everyday nature‚Äîranging from name tags, prayers (often in Latin), personal messages, business letters, and expressions of affection, to bawdy phrases of a profane and sometimes even of a vulgar nature. Following this find, it is nowadays commonly presumed that, at least in late use, Runic was a widespread and common writing system. 17th-century clog almanac collected by Sir Hans Sloane. Now in the collection of the British Museum In the later Middle Ages, runes also were used in the clog almanacs (sometimes called Runic staff, Prim, or Scandinavian calendar) of Sweden and Estonia. The authenticity of some monuments bearing Runic inscriptions found in Northern America is disputed; most of them have been dated to modern times. ===Runes in Eddic lore=== In Norse mythology, the runic alphabet is attested to a divine origin (). This is attested as early as on the Noleby Runestone from that reads , meaning \\"I prepare the suitable divine rune...\\". and in an attestation from the 9th century on the Sparl√∂sa Runestone, which reads , meaning \\"And interpret the runes of divine origin\\".. In the Poetic Edda poem , Stanza 80, the runes also are described as : The poem explains that the originator of the runes was the major deity, Odin. Stanza 138 describes how Odin received the runes through self-sacrifice: In stanza 139, Odin continues: This passage has been interpreted as a mythical representation of shamanic initial rituals in which the initiate must undergo a physical trial in order to receive mystic wisdom.. In the Poetic Edda poem another origin is related of how the runic alphabet became known to humans. The poem relates how , identified as in the introduction, sired three sons‚Äî (slave), (freeman), and (noble)‚Äîby human women. These sons became the ancestors of the three classes of humans indicated by their names. When Jarl reached an age when he began to handle weapons and show other signs of nobility, returned and, having claimed him as a son, taught him the runes. In 1555, the exiled Swedish archbishop recorded a tradition that a man named had stolen three rune staffs from Odin and learned the runes and their magic. ==Runic alphabets Elder Futhark (2nd to 8th centuries) === Detail of the Elder Futhark inscription on a replica of one of the 5th-century AD Golden Horns of Gallehus found on Jutland, now Denmark The Elder Futhark, used for writing Proto-Norse, consists of 24 runes that often are arranged in three groups of eight; each group is referred to as an √Ütt. The earliest known sequential listing of the full set of 24 runes dates to approximately AD 400 and is found on the Kylver Stone in Gotland, Sweden. Most probably each rune had a name, chosen to represent the sound of the rune itself. The names are, however, not directly attested for the Elder Futhark themselves. Reconstructed names in Proto-Germanic have been produced, based on the names given for the runes in the later alphabets attested in the rune poems and the linked names of the letters of the Gothic alphabet. The letter /a/ was named from the runic letter 20x16px called Ansuz. An asterisk before the rune names means that they are unattested reconstructions. The 24 Elder Futhark runes are: === Anglo- Saxon runes (5th to 11th centuries) === The Anglo-Saxon Futhorc The futhorc (sometimes written \\"fu√æorc\\") are an extended alphabet, consisting of 29, and later 33 characters. It was probably used from the 5th century onwards. There are competing theories as to the origins of the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc. One theory proposes that it was developed in Frisia and later spread to England, while another holds that Scandinavians introduced runes to England, where the futhorc was modified and exported to Frisia. Some examples of futhorc inscriptions are found on the Thames scramasax, in the Vienna Codex, in Cotton Otho B.x (Anglo-Saxon rune poem) and on the Ruthwell Cross. The Anglo-Saxon rune poem gives the following characters and names: feoh, ur, √æorn, os, rad, cen, gyfu, ∆øynn, h√¶gl, nyd, is, ger, eoh, peor√∞, eolh, sigel, tir, beorc, eh, mann, lagu, ing, ≈ìthel, d√¶g, ac, √¶sc, yr, ior, ear. Extra runes attested to outside of the rune poem include cweor√∞, calc, gar, and stan. Some of these additional letters have only been found in manuscripts. Feoh, √æorn, and sigel stood for [f], [√æ], and [s] in most environments, but voiced to [v], [√∞], and [z] between vowels or voiced consonants. Gyfu and wynn stood for the letters yogh and wynn, which became [g] and [w] in Middle English. ===\\"Marcomannic runes\\" (8th to 9th centuries)=== Marcomannic runes A runic alphabet consisting of a mixture of Elder Futhark with Anglo-Saxon futhorc is recorded in a treatise called De Inventione Litterarum, ascribed to Hrabanus Maurus and preserved in 8th- and 9th-century manuscripts mainly from the southern part of the Carolingian Empire (Alemannia, Bavaria). The manuscript text attributes the runes to the Marcomanni, quos nos Nordmannos vocamus, and hence traditionally, the alphabet is called \\"Marcomannic runes\\", but it has no connection with the Marcomanni, and rather is an attempt of Carolingian scholars to represent all letters of the Latin alphabets with runic equivalents. Wilhelm Grimm discussed these runes in 1821.. ===Younger Futhark (9th to 11th centuries)=== The Younger Futhark: long-branch runes and short- twig runes Ramsung carving is a Sigurd stone that depicts the legend of Sigurd. The Younger Futhark, also called Scandinavian Futhark, is a reduced form of the Elder Futhark, consisting of only 16 characters. The reduction correlates with phonetic changes when Proto-Norse evolved into Old Norse. They are found in Scandinavia and Viking Age settlements abroad, probably in use from the 9th century onward. They are divided into long-branch (Danish) and short-twig (Swedish and Norwegian) runes. The difference between the two versions is a matter of controversy. A general opinion is that the difference between them was functional (viz., the long-branch runes were used for documentation on stone, whereas the short-twig runes were in everyday use for private or official messages on wood). ===Medieval runes (12th to 15th centuries)=== Medieval runes A church bell from Saleby, V√§sterg√∂tland, Sweden, containing a runic inscription from 1228 AD In the Middle Ages, the Younger Futhark in Scandinavia was expanded, so that it once more contained one sign for each phoneme of the Old Norse language. Dotted variants of voiceless signs were introduced to denote the corresponding voiced consonants, or vice versa, voiceless variants of voiced consonants, and several new runes also appeared for vowel sounds. Inscriptions in medieval Scandinavian runes show a large number of variant rune forms, and some letters, such as s, c, and z often were used interchangeably. Medieval runes were in use until the 15th century. Of the total number of Norwegian runic inscriptions preserved today, most are medieval runes. Notably, more than 600 inscriptions using these runes have been discovered in Bergen since the 1950s, mostly on wooden sticks (the so- called Bryggen inscriptions). This indicates that runes were in common use side by side with the Latin alphabet for several centuries. Indeed, some of the medieval runic inscriptions are written in Latin. ===Dalecarlian runes (16th to 19th centuries)=== Dalecarlian runes According to Carl-Gustav Werner, \\"In the isolated province of Dalarna in Sweden a mix of runes and Latin letters developed.\\" The Dalecarlian runes came into use in the early 16th century and remained in some use up to the 20th century. Some discussion remains on whether their use was an unbroken tradition throughout this period or whether people in the 19th and 20th centuries learned runes from books written on the subject. The character inventory was used mainly for transcribing Elfdalian. ==Academic study== The modern study of runes was initiated during the Renaissance, by Johannes Bureus (1568‚Äì1652). Bureus viewed runes as holy or magical in a kabbalistic sense. The study of runes was continued by Olof Rudbeck Sr (1630‚Äì1702) and presented in his collection Atlantica. Anders Celsius (1701‚Äì1744) further extended the science of runes and travelled around the whole of Sweden to examine the runstenar (runestones). From the \\"golden age of philology\\" in the 19th century, runology formed a specialized branch of Germanic linguistics. ==Body of inscriptions== Vimose Comb from the island of Funen, Denmark, features the earliest known runic inscription (AD 150 to 200) and simply reads, ·ö∫·ö®·ö±·õÉ·ö® \\"Harja\\", a male name. The largest group of surviving Runic inscription are Viking Age Younger Futhark runestones, commonly found in Denmark and Sweden. Another large group are medieval runes, most commonly found on small objects, often wooden sticks. The largest concentration of runic inscriptions are the Bryggen inscriptions found in Bergen, more than 650 in total. Elder Futhark inscriptions number around 350, about 260 of which are from Scandinavia, of which about half are on bracteates. Anglo-Saxon futhorc inscriptions number around 100 items. ==Modern use== Runic alphabets have seen numerous uses since the 18th-century Viking revival, in Scandinavian Romantic nationalism (Gothicismus) and Germanic occultism in the 19th century, and in the context of the Fantasy genre and of Germanic Neopaganism in the 20th century. ===Esotericism===  Germanic mysticism and Nazi symbolism  Runic script on an 1886 gravestone in Parkend, England From 1933, Schutzstaffel unit insignia displayed two Sig Runes The pioneer of the Armanist branch of Ariosophy and one of the more important figures in esotericism in Germany and Austria in the late 19th and early 20th century was the Austrian occultist, mysticist, and v√∂lkisch author, Guido von List. In 1908, he published in Das Geheimnis der Runen (\\"The Secret of the Runes\\") a set of eighteen so-called, \\"Armanen runes\\", based on the Younger Futhark and runes of List's own introduction, which allegedly were revealed to him in a state of temporary blindness after cataract operations on both eyes in 1902. The use of runes in Germanic mysticism, notably List's \\"Armanen runes\\" and the derived \\"Wiligut runes\\" by Karl Maria Wiligut, played a certain role in Nazi symbolism. The fascination with runic symbolism was mostly limited to Heinrich Himmler, and not shared by the other members of the Nazi top echelon. Consequently, runes appear mostly in insignia associated with the Schutzstaffel (\\"SS\\"), the paramilitary organization led by Himmler. Wiligut is credited with designing the SS-Ehrenring, which displays a number of \\"Wiligut runes\\". Modern neopaganism and esotericism Runes are popular in Germanic neopaganism, and to a lesser extent in other forms of Neopaganism and New Age esotericism. Various systems of Runic divination have been published since the 1980s, notably by Ralph Blum (1982), Stephen Flowers (1984, onward), Stephan Grundy (1990), and Nigel Pennick (1995). The Uthark theory originally was proposed as a scholarly hypothesis by Sigurd Agrell in 1932. In 2002, Swedish esotericist Thomas Karlsson popularized this \\"Uthark\\" runic row, which he refers to as, the \\"night side of the runes\\", in the context of modern occultism. === Bluetooth === The Bluetooth logo is the combination of two runes of the Younger Futhark, hagall and bjarkan, equivalent to the letters ¬´H¬ª and ¬´B¬ª, that are the initials of Harald Bl√•tand's name (bluetooth in English), who was a king of Denmark from the Viking Age. Bluetooth logo with the initials of Harald Bl√•tand. ===J. R. R. Tolkien and contemporary fiction=== In J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Hobbit (1937), the Anglo-Saxon runes are used on a map to emphasize its connection to the Dwarves. They also were used in the initial drafts of The Lord of the Rings, but later were replaced by the Cirth rune- like alphabet invented by Tolkien, used to write the language of the Dwarves, Khuzdul. Following Tolkien, historical and fictional runes appear commonly in modern popular culture, particularly in fantasy literature, but also in other forms of media such as video games (for example the 1992 video game Heimdall used it as \\"magical symbols\\" associated with unnatural forces) and role- playing games, such as Metagaming's The Fantasy Trip, which used rune-based cipher for clues and jokes throughout its publications. ==Unicode== Runic Steel Stamps, Elder Futhark Runic alphabets were added to the Unicode Standard in September, 1999 with the release of version 3.0. The Unicode block for Runic alphabets is U+16A0‚ÄìU+16FF. It is intended to encode the letters of the Elder Futhark, the Anglo-Frisian runes, and the Younger Futhark long-branch and short-twig (but not the staveless) variants, in cases where cognate letters have the same shape resorting to \\"unification\\". The block as of Unicode 3.0 contained 81 symbols: 75 runic letters (U+16A0‚ÄìU+16EA), 3 punctuation marks (Runic Single Punctuation U+16EB , Runic Multiple Punctuation U+16EC and Runic Cross Punctuation U+16ED ), and three runic symbols that are used in early modern runic calendar staves (\\"Golden number Runes\\", Runic Arlaug Symbol U+16EE , Runic Tvimadur Symbol U+16EF , Runic Belgthor Symbol U+16F0 ). As of Unicode 7.0 (2014), eight characters were added, three attributed to J. R. R. Tolkien's mode of writing Modern English in Anglo-Saxon runes, and five for the \\"cryptogrammic\\" vowel symbols used in an inscription on the Franks Casket. ==See also== * Gothic runic inscriptions * Runic inscription in the Netherlands * Runiform (disambiguation) for \\"rune- like\\" but believed-unrelated scripts described as \\"runes\\" ** Hunnic language - possible script of 3rd & 4th century Hunn Empire ** Old Turkic script or Turkic runes *** Old Hungarian script or Hungarian runes, descended from Old Turkic runes ** Siglas poveiras * Pentimal system of numerals * Runic magic ==Notes== ==ReferencesBibliography=== * . * . * * . * . * . * * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * ==External links== * . * . * . * * * . * Old Norse Online by Todd B.

He was the last absolute monarch and the first constitutional monarch of the country. His reign was a turbulent time for Siam due to political and social changes during the Revolution of 1932. He is to date the only Siamese monarch of the Chakri Dynasty to abdicate. ==Early life== Young Prajadhipok and his mother, thumb Somdet Chaofa Prajadhipok Sakdidej () was born on 8 November 1893 in Bangkok, Siam (now Thailand) to King Chulalongkorn and Queen Saovabha Phongsri. Prince Prajadhipok was the youngest of nine children born to the couple. Overall he was the king's second-youngest child (of a total of 77), and the 33rd and youngest of Chulalongkorn's sons. Unlikely to succeed to the throne, Prince Prajadhipok chose to pursue a military career. Like many of the king's children, he was sent abroad to study, going to Eton College in 1906, then to the Woolwich Military Academy from which he graduated in 1913. He received a commission in the Royal Horse Artillery in the British Army based in Aldershot. In 1910 Chulalongkorn died and was succeeded by Prajadhipok's older brother (also a son of Queen Saovabha), Crown Prince Vajiravudh, who became King Rama VI. Prince Prajadhipok was by then commissioned in both the British Army and the Royal Siamese Army. With the outbreak of the First World War and the declaration of Siamese neutrality, King Vajiravudh ordered his younger brother to resign his British commission and return to Siam immediately, a great embarrassment to the prince, who wanted to serve with his men on the Western front. Once home, Prajadhipok became a high-ranking military official in Siam. In 1917 he was ordained temporarily as a monk, as was customary for most Buddhist Siamese men. In August 1918 Prince Prajadhipok married his childhood friend and cousin Rambhai Barni, a descendant of King Mongkut (Prajadhipok's grandfather) and his Royal Consort Piam. They were married at Sukhothai Palace which was a wedding gift to the couple from Queen Saovabha. After the war in Europe ended, he attended the √âcole Superieure de Guerre in France, returning to Siam to the Siamese military. During this time, he was granted the additional title Krom Luang Sukhothai (Prince of Sukhothai). Prajadhipok lived a generally quiet life with his wife at their residence, Sukhothai Palace, next to the Chao Phraya River. The couple had no children. Prajadhipok soon found himself rising rapidly in succession to the throne, as his brothers all died within a relatively short period. In 1925, King Vajiravudh himself died at the age of 44. Prajadhipok became absolute monarch at only thirty-two. He was crowned King of Siam on 25 February 1926. thumb Coronation of King Prajadhipok inside the Phaisan Thaksin Hall, Grand Palace on 25 February 1926. ==Last absolute monarch== Relatively unprepared for his new responsibilities, Prajadhipok was nevertheless intelligent, diplomatic in his dealings with others, modest, and eager to learn.Wyatt, David K. (1982) Thailand: A Short History. New Haven. However, he had inherited serious political and economic problems from his predecessor. The budget was heavily in deficit, and the royal financial accounts were in serious disorder. The entire world was in the throes of the Great Depression. King Prajadhipok In an institutional innovation intended to restore confidence in the monarchy and government, Prajadhipok, in what was virtually his first act as king, announced the creation of the Supreme Council of the State of Siam. This council was made up of five experienced members of the royal family, although to emphasise the break with the previous reign the selected five had all fallen out of favour with the previous monarch. The council thus comprised three of the king's uncles, Prince Bhanurangsi, Prince Naris and Prince Damrong Rajanubhab and two of his half-brothers, Prince Kitiyakon (Prince Chantaburi) and Prince Boriphat. Many of the Princes of the Supreme Council felt that it was their duty to make amends for the mistakes of the previous reign, but their acts were not generally appreciated, for the government failed to communicate to the public the purpose of the policies they pursued to rectify Vajiravudh's extreme financial extravagances.Stowe, Judith A. (1990) Siam Becomes Thailand. Hurst & Company. Gradually these princes arrogated power to themselves, monopolising all the main ministerial positions and appointing their sons and brothers to both administrative and military posts. By April 1926 almost the entire cabinet of ministry heads had been replaced with newly appointed Princes or nobles, with only three former members being re-appointed. While the family appointments brought back men of talent and experience, they also signalled a return to royal oligarchy. The king clearly wished to demonstrate a clear break with the discredited sixth reign, and his choice of men to fill the top positions appeared to be guided largely by a wish to restore a Chulalongkorn-type government.Terwiel, B.J. (2005) Thailand's Political History: From the Fall of Ayutthaya to Recent Times. River Books. Unlike his predecessor, the king read virtually all state papers that came his way, from ministerial submissions to petitions by citizens. The king was painstaking and conscientious; he would elicit comments and suggestions from a range of experts and study them, noting the good points in each submission, but when various options were available he would seldom be able to select the best one and abandon others. He would often rely upon the Supreme Council to prod him in a particular direction. King Prajadhipok in Khrui, carrying Krabi. From the beginning of his reign King Prajadhipok was acutely aware that political change was necessary if the monarchy was to be preserved. He viewed his newly established Supreme Council as an institutional check upon the powers of an absolute monarch. During 1926, Prajadhipok experimented with using the Privy Council, which had over 200 members at that time, as a quasi-legislative body. This large of an assembly proved too cumbersome, and in 1927 Prajadhipok created the Committee of the Privy Council consisting of 40 members selected from the royal family or nobility. The committee was received positively by the press and was envisaged as a forerunner of a parliament or National Assembly. In practice however the committee remained relatively unimportant and sadly did not develop into a more powerful or representative body. In 1926 Prajadhipok wrote a lengthy memorandum to his American adviser Francis B. Sayre titled \\"Problems of Siam\\" in which he set forth nine questions he felt were the most serious facing the nation. The third question asked whether Siam should have a parliamentary system, which Prajadhipok doubted. The fourth question asked whether Siam was ready for representative government, to which Prajadhipok answered \\"my personal opinion is an emphatic NO\\". However, the king did see a possibility to introduce reform at the local level as the \\"next step in our educational move towards democracy\\". In 1926 he began moves to develop the concept of prachaphiban, or \\"municipality\\", which had emerged late in the fifth reign as a law regarding public health and sanitation.Sonthi Techanan (1976) Plans for Democratic Development in the Seventh Reign. Kasetsart University. Information was obtained regarding local self-government in surrounding countries, and proposals to allow certain municipalities to raise local taxes and manage their own budgets were drawn up. The fact that the public was not sufficiently educated to make the scheme work militated against the success of this administrative venture. Nevertheless, the idea of teaching the Siamese the concept of democracy through a measure of decentralisation of power in municipalities had become, in Prajadhipok's mind, fundamental to future policy-making.Batson, Benjamin. (1984) The End of the Absolute Monarchy in Siam. Oxford University Press. Hoever, Yasukichi Yatabe, Japanese minister to Siam, criticized the King's way and that it would not be accomplished in a hundred years' time.‚Äú‡∏ä‡∏¥‡∏á‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏Å‡∏Å‡πà‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏´‡πà‡∏≤‡∏°‚Äù ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏£‡∏°‡∏ã‡∏±‡∏î‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏Ñ‡∏ì‡∏∞‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏©‡∏é‡∏£ ‡πÉ‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏ö‡∏ö‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ô‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏®‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏ï‡∏£‡πå‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢ In September 1931 Britain abandoned the gold standard and devalued sterling by 30 percent. This created a crisis for Siam since most of its foreign exchange was held in sterling. The Minister of Finance kept Siam on the gold standard by linking the currency to the US dollar, but debate about this policy raged within the government into 1932. One impact of this policy was that Siam's rice exports became more expensive than competitor exporters, negatively impacting revenue. In mid-October 1931 the king returned from a trip to Canada and the US and ordered Prince Devawongse Varoprakar, the Minister of Foreign Affairs to prepare a constitution. The task of drafting this document was given to the American Raymond B. Stevens and Phaya Sri Wisarn Waja. In March the following year they submitted an \\"Outline of Changes in the Form of Government\\" together with their comments. Prajadhipok originally planned to announce the new constitution to the nation of 6 April at the opening of the Memorial Bridge to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Chakri dynasty. These proposals met strong opposition from Prince Damrong and other royal members of the Supreme Council and despite his own misgivings that to not proceed would result in a coup against his government, the king ultimately did not make the planned announcement. On 20 January 1932, with the country deep in depression, the king convened a \\"round table\\" meeting to discuss the many competing arguments and to agree on how to tackle the crisis. From this meeting it was agreed to make large cuts in government spending and implement a retrenchment programme. Two weeks later on 5 February the king addressed a group of military officers and spoke at length about the economic situation. In this speech he remarked \\"I myself know nothing at all about managing finances, and all I can do is listen to the opinions of others and choose the best...If I have made a mistake, I believe I really deserve to be excused by the people of Siam.\\" No previous monarch had ever spoken so honestly. The speech was widely reported and many interpreted his words not as a frank appeal for understanding and cooperation, but as a sign of weakness and proof that the system of rule of fallible autocrats should be abolished.Vella, Walter (1955) The Impact of the West on Government in Thailand. University of California Press. ==Revolution of 1932== Troops on the street during the revolution. A small group of soldiers and civil servants began secretly plotting to overthrow absolute monarchy and bring a constitutional government to the kingdom. Their efforts culminated in an almost bloodless \\"revolution\\" on the morning of 24 June 1932 by the self-proclaimed Khana Ratsadon (People's Party; ‡∏Ñ‡∏ì‡∏∞‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏©‡∏é‡∏£). While Prajadhipok was away at Klai Kangwon Palace in Hua Hin, the plotters took control of the Ananda Samakhom Throne Hall in Bangkok and arrested key officials (mainly princes and relatives of the king). The People's Party demanded Prajadhipok become a constitutional monarch and grant Thai people a constitution. In the event of a negative response, they reserved the right to declare Siam a republic. The king immediately accepted the People's Party's request and the first \\"permanent\\" constitution of Siam was promulgated on 10 December. Prajadhipok returned to Bangkok on 26 June and received the coup plotters in a royal audience. As they entered the room, Prajadhipok greeted them, saying \\"I rise in honour of the Khana Ratsadorn.\\"Thawatt Mokarapong. (1972) History of the Thai Revolution. Chalermnit.Pridi Phanomyong (1974) Ma vie mouvement√©e. Paris. It was a significant gesture because, according to previous royal rituals, monarchs were to remain seated while their subjects made obeisance. Prajadhipok was acknowledging the changed circumstances. Absolute monarchy was finished. ==First constitutional monarch== The Constitution of the Siam Kingdom 1932 on 10 December 1932 TIME magazine cover in 1931alt= In the early stages of the constitutional monarchy, the King and the royalists seemed to be able to compromise with Khana Ratsadon. The constitutional bill which was drafted by Pridi Banomyong and intended to be a permanent one was made temporary. The new constitution restored some of the monarch's lost power and status. Among them were introduction of unelected half of the House of Representatives and royal veto power. The country's first prime minister Phraya Manopakorn Nititada was a conservative and royalist nobleman. The compromise broke down quickly. He did not contest when his interpretation of Pridi's economic plan, which also aim on land reform and seizure of royal land, was released with his signature. The King played a role in the coup d'√©tat of April 1933 where the House was ordered to close by the Prime Minister. He signed an order to execute Khana Ratsadon leaders. But Khana Ratsadon's military wing leader Phraya Phahol Phonphayuhasena ousted the government and restored its power. He played an active role in an anti- revolutionary network, which also aim to assassinate Khana Ratsadon's leaders. In October 1933, the maverick Prince Boworadej, a former minister of defence, led an armed revolt against the government. In the Boworadet Rebellion, he mobilised several provincial garrisons and marched on Bangkok, occupying the Don Muang aerodrome. Prince Boworadej accused the government of being disrespectful to the monarch and of promoting communism, and demanded that government leaders resign. The rebellion ultimately failed. The King did not directly supported the rebellion, but there was a check from the treasury to Boworadej. The insurrection diminished the king's prestige. When the revolt began, Prajadhipok immediately informed the government that he regretted the strife and civil disturbances. The royal couple then took refuge at Songkhla, in the far south. The king's withdrawal from the scene was interpreted by the Khana Ratsadorn as a failure to do his duty. By not throwing his full support behind government forces, he had undermined their trust in him. In 1934 the Assembly voted to amend civil and military penal codes. The King vetoed the changes to the separation between personal and royal assets as he did not want to pay tax, and protested an amendment to diminish the King's consideration of death sentence over the courts. After many losses to Khana Ratsadon, the King seemed to change his stance and expressed support for democracy and blamed Khana Ratsadon for being anti-democratic. However, Phibul later discussed in the House that unelected parliamentary members were the King's wish, and another House member criticized the King for being unbearable. Prajadhipok, whose relations with the Khana Ratsadon had been deteriorating for some time, went on a tour of Europe before visiting England for medical treatment. He continued to correspond with the government regarding the conditions under which he would continue to serve. He tried to retained some of the royal powers, such as power to veto law with no possible override. Other disagreements were on royal assets and royal benefits. After the government did not comply, on 14 October Prajadhipok announced his intention to abdicate unless his requests were met. === King Prajadhipok's trip to Europe === File:Hitler and Rama VII.jpgKing Prajadhipok and Adolf Hitler at Berlin Tempelhof Airport in Nazi Germany, 1934 File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2005-0524-508, Berlin, Ankunft des siamesischen K√∂nigspaares.jpgKing Prajadhipok and Queen Rambhai Barni with Konstantin von Neurath in Nazi Germany, 1934 ==Abdication== Prajadhipok looking outside a train The People's Party rejected the ultimatum, and on 2 March 1935, Prajadhipok abdicated, to be replaced by Ananda Mahidol. Prajadhipok issued a brief statement criticising the regime that included the following phrases, since often quoted by critics of Thailand's slow political development. The former king had good grounds for complaint. Reaction to the abdication was muted. Stowe wrote that the absolutism of the monarchy had been replaced by that of the People's Party, with the military looming in the wings as the ultimate arbiter of power. ==Life after abdication and death== King Prajadhipok and Queen Rambhai Barni with British Premier Ramsay MacDonald at Number 10 Downing Street Prajadhipok spent the rest of his life with Queen Rambhai Barni in England. At the time of abdication, the couple lived at Knowle House, in Surrey, just outside London. However, this house was not suitable considering his health, so they moved to a smaller house in Virginia Water (still in Surrey), but with more space. The house was named \\"Hangmoor\\", but wishing to give it a more pleasant name, he called it \\"Glen Pammant\\", an anagram of an old Thai phrase tam pleng nam. They remained there for two years. The couple had no children, but adopted the youngest son of Prince Bhanurangsi Savangwongse, (one of King Chulalongkorn's full brother). The adopted son, Prince Suprabhat Chirasakti (or Jirasakdi), would later serve as a pilot in Britain's Air Transport Auxiliary during the Second World War, with the rank of Second Officer (S/O). He died on Saturday, 12 September, 1942, while delivering a Hawker Sea Hurricane IIC (JS346) from RAF Kirkbride aerodrome near Kirkbride, Cumbria.ABANDONED FORGOTTEN & LITTLE KNOWN AIRFIELDS IN EUROPE: RAF KirkBride[https://www.solwaymilitarytrail.co.uk/trail-attractions/raf- kirkbride/ Solway Military Trail: RAF Kirkbride S/O Prince Prince Chirasakti, known as Cherry by his friends in the ATA, took off along with F/O Forbes (a volunteer from the United States) in very cloudy conditions shortly after 1200 Hrs and flew northward. Forbes returned alone within fifteen minutes. S/O Prince Chirasakti was reported overdue at his destination (Arbroath) at 18:00 Hrs. By midnight it had been learnt that he had crashed into a hill near Eweslees Farm, Langholm, in Scotland. He had entered a blind valley in low cloud, tried to turn, flew into a hill and was killed. He had his flaps down, and was not flying very fast. \\"Just fast enough to kill him,\\" the investigating officer reported to his colleagues. His friend, Third Officer Roy William Reisert (another American volunteer who had trained for the RAF at the Bermuda Flying School before joining the ATA) and F/O Davy were given the task of clearing his personal effects from his locker at RAF Kirkbride.

The funeral service was conducted with Buddhist rites by a Buddhist priest, with a guard of honour provided by the Royal Air Force and colleagues from the Air Transport Auxiliary. The funeral was attended by Queen Rambhai Barni of Thailand, Prince Abbhas, Prince Birabongse Bhanudej, Mani Xenier Bunnag, Captain and Mrs JB Wyndham, the Earl of Derby, Captain HJ Stocks (Flying Establishment Officer, ATA, representing the RAF) and Flight Lieutenant J Gallatly (representing the ATA).The Times, London, 17 September, 1942 They moved again to Vane Court, the oldest house in the village of Biddenden in Kent. He led a peaceful life there, gardening in the morning and writing his autobiography in the afternoon. In 1938 the royal couple moved to Compton House, in the village of Wentworth in Virginia Water, Surrey. Due to bombing by the German Luftwaffe in 1940, the couple again moved, first to a small house in Devon, and then to Lake Vyrnwy Hotel in Powys, Wales, where the former king suffered a heart attack. The couple returned to Compton House, as he expressed his preference to die there. King Prajadhipok died from heart failure on 30 May 1941. His cremation was held at the Golders Green Crematorium in north London.https://www.silpa-mag.com/old-photos-tell-the- historical-story/article_12544 It was a simple affair attended by just Queen Ramphai and a handful of close relatives. Queen Ramphaiphanni stayed at Compton House for a further eight years before she returned to Thailand in 1949, bringing the king's ashes back with her.https://lifestyle.campus- star.com/knowledge/88087.html ==Legacy== Among the recent Chakri monarchs, particularly Chulalongkorn and Bhumibol, Prajadhipok emerged with relatively little revisionistic detraction. He was a hard-working, effective administrator who was intellectually equal to the demands of his office, and whose main failing was to underestimate the Bangkok elite's growing demand for power. As late as his death in exile, many, as the historian David K. Wyatt puts it, \\"would have agreed with his judgement that a move towards democracy in 1932 was premature.\\" ==Tributes to Prajadhipok== File:Monument of King Rama VII at Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University 01.jpgA Statue of the king in Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University, Nonthaburi File:Prajadhipok statue - Thai Parliament Museum - 2017-01-26 (008).jpgKing Rama VII statue at Parliament House of Thailand == Titles, styles and honours == 120px ===Titles and styles=== As monarch, Prajadhipok was referred to by his reigning name of Phrabat Somdet Phra Pokklao Chao Yuhua (‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ö‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏™‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏î‡πá‡∏à‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏õ‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏•‡πâ‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏π‡πà‡∏´‡∏±‡∏ß) and in legal documents was a more formal Phrabat Somdet Phra Poraminthra Maha Prajadhipok Phra Pokklao Chao Yuhua (‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ö‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏™‡∏°‡πÄ‡∏î‡πá‡∏à‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏°‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏£‡∏°‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏ò‡∏¥‡∏õ‡∏Å ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏õ‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏•‡πâ‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏π‡πà‡∏´‡∏±‡∏ß) Thais today usually call him Ratchakan thi Chet (lit. \\"The Seventh Reign\\") or more colloquially, Phra Pok Klao (‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏õ‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏•‡πâ‡∏≤), and in English, King Rama VII.

It can be seen in some forms of heart disease and is usually indicative of limited right ventricular filling due to right heart dysfunction. ==Pathophysiology== Ordinarily the JVP falls with inspiration due to reduced pressure in the expanding thoracic cavity and the increased volume afforded to right ventricular expansion during diastole. Kussmaul sign suggests impaired filling of the right ventricle due to a poorly compliant myocardium or pericardium. This impaired filling causes the increased blood flow to back up into the venous system, causing the jugular vein distension (JVD) and is seen clinically in the internal jugular veins becoming more readily visible. ==Causes== The differential diagnosis generally associated with Kussmaul sign is constrictive pericarditis, as well as with restrictive cardiomyopathy. With cardiac tamponade, jugular veins are distended and typically show a prominent x descent and an absent y descent as opposed to patients with constrictive pericarditis (prominent x and y descent), see Beck's triad.Disorders of the Cardiovascular System; Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine 17th, and Self-assessment & Board Review cardiovascular system questions 15, 29 Other possible causes of Kussmaul's sign include: * Right ventricular infarction - low ventricular compliance * Right heart failure * Cardiac tumours * Tricuspid stenosis * Restrictive cardiomyopathy * Pulmonary embolism *Constrictive pericarditis ==History== Kussmaul's sign is named after the German doctor who first described it, Adolph Kussmaul (1822-1902).A.

First appearing in Soul Music, Hex is an elaborate, magic-powered, self-building computer (not unlike the 'shamble', a kind of magical device used by the Witches of the Discworld) featuring ants and cheese as part of its architecture, and is housed in the basement of the High Energy Magic Building at the Unseen University (UU) in the twin city of Ankh-Morpork. Hex is a computer unlike any other the Disc has ever seen, which is not particularly exceptional since previously all other \\"computers\\" on the Disc had consisted of druidic stone circles. Programmed via 'Softlore', Hex runs and evolves under the watchful eyes of wizard Ponder Stibbons, who becomes the de facto IT manager at UU because he's the only one who understands what he's talking about. ==Origins and evolution== Hex has its origins in a device that briefly appeared in Soul Music, created by Ponder Stibbons and some student Wizards in the High Energy Magic building. In this form it was simply a complex network of glass tubes, containing ants. The wizards could then use punched cards to control which tubes the ants could crawl through, enabling it to perform simple mathematical functions. By the time of the next novel, Interesting Times, Hex had become a lot more complex, and was constantly reinventing itself. Part of it is now clockwork, which interfaces with the ant-farm via a paternoster lift the ants can ride on that turns a significant cogwheel. Its main purposes were, in a sense, data compression and information retrieval: to analyse spells, to see if there were simpler \\"meta-spells\\" underlying them, and to help Stibbons with his study of \\"invisible writings\\" by running the spells used to bring the writings into existence. (These spells must be cast rapidly, and each one can only be used once before the universe notices they shouldn't work.) In The Last Continent it was explained that the invisible writings were snippets of books that were written a long time ago and lost, snippets of books that hadn't been written yet, and snippets of books that would never be written. The theory behind this was, all books are tenuously connected, due to the fact that every book ever written cites information from every other book, whether the writers mean to or not. Hex helps Stibbons by magically trawling the ether for these scraps of information. In Hogfather Hex contained several things that nobody remembered installing, and was asking about electricity. It was at around this time that the wizards become concerned that it may be trying to become something they didn't understand. By The Science of Discworld Hex was capable of \\"once and future computing\\": increasing its abilities simply by deducing that the required processing power would exist eventually. Presumably this requires a high expenditure of magic, as it has not been mentioned again; at the time, there was a massive excess of magic available due to a near catastrophic overload of the university's experimental thaumic reactor. This virtual memory appeared as translucent silver towers superimposed onto the real Hex. Hex was sufficiently intelligent by this time not to tell the wizards what it was doing, in case it worried them. By Unseen Academicals, Ponder Stibbons has placed a mask on the wall to communicate with, even though Hex's voice seems to come from everywhere as it travels in blit space. (Ponder comments \\"somehow, well, it feels better to have something to talk to.\\") By the time of The Science of Discworld II: The Globe Stibbons has hooked Hex up to the University's clacks tower. Hex has worked out all the codes, meaning the University can now use the clacks for free, and has the Disc's first modem. (The legal issues have been carefully considered by Archchancellor Mustrum Ridcully, who concluded that 'no-one was going to find out, so they may as well do as they please'.) It is, however, debatable whether-or-not the Patrician, Lord Havelock Vetinari, knows. In The Art of Discworld, Pratchett explains that \\"the wizards invented something sufficiently computer-like that computerness entered into it.\\" ==Structure and technology== Currently, Hex is activated by \\"initializing the GBL,\\" which Ponder Stibbons reluctantly admits means \\"pulling the Great Big Lever\\" (similar to the Internet slang \\"BRS\\", or \\"big red switch\\"). This is also a reference to the IBM Mainframe terminology for booting, known as IPL. This action releases millions of ants into a much more complex network of glass tubes that makes up the bulk of Hex, hence the sticker on Hex that reads \\"Anthill inside\\": a pun on Intel's ad slogan \\"Intel Inside\\". Hex \\"thinks\\" by controlling which tubes the ants can crawl through, thus allowing it to perform increasingly complex computations if enough ants are provided (that is, if there are enough bugs in the system). This is a reference to Douglas Hofstadter's G√∂del, Escher, Bach in which there exists a sentient ant colony, with the ants acting as neurons. Hex can now be given input through a huge wooden keyboard, in analogue writing by means of a complicated mechanical eye designed by Hex itself, or vocally through an old hearing trumpet, and gives output by means of a series of wooden blocks and later a quill on a hinged lever (echoing the real-world evolution of computer output from paper tape to video monitor). It is all powered by a waterwheel covered in male sheep skulls, i.e. RAM. When it is particularly busy, an hourglass comes down on a spring ‚Äì another sideways reference to Windows. Another apparently important feature is an aquarium, so the operator has something to watch when Hex is working (Hex's screensaver). Hex's long-term memory storage is a massive beehive contained in the next room. The presence of the bees makes this secure memory, because attempting to tamper with it would result in being \\"stung to death\\" (as described in Hogfather). As a further advantage, when Hex is turned off for the summer, the beehive will provide quite a lot of honey. There is also a mouse (pun for a computer pointer) that has built its nest in the middle of Hex. It doesn't seem to do anything, but Hex stops working if it is removed, or if Ponder forgets to feed it cheese (also from Hogfather). Hex also stops working (with the error message \\"Mine! Waah!\\") if the FTB is removed/disengaged; \\"FTB\\" stands for \\"Fluffy Teddy Bear,\\" which was Hex's Hogswatchnight gift when Death stood in for the Hogfather. (FTB is a pun on FTP, the File Transfer Protocol.) Stibbons is concerned by these signs that Hex might be alive, but dismisses these thoughts, insisting that Hex only thinks it is alive. Hex can apparently be shut down completely by means of a Big Red Lever (BRL). This seems to worry it further, indicating sentient life because it is afraid of death (in this case shutting down). An example of this appears in Hogfather: when Death approaches Hex, it asks if it is \\"Big Red Lever time\\". ==Other Discworld computers== According to The Science of Discworld III: Darwin's Watch, another Hex-like machine has been invented by the smaller magical university of Brazeneck College. This is much simpler than the original, however; according to Stibbons, Hex is technically a Very Big Thing, while the Brazeneck device is barely a Quite Big Thing. (The next step up would be a Great Big Thing, every particle of the universe being modeled within it; apparently these terms are quite exact, as when the Lecturer in Recent Runes postulated that the Brazeneck wizards would try and build an Even Bigger Thing, Ponder Stibbons corrected him. Apparently a Very Big Thing is capable of pushing boundaries twice as big up to three times as far as a Quite Big Thing). The Hex-like machine was mentioned again in Unseen Academicals, as constructed by the staff of the Higher Energy Magic Building at Brazeneck college (of whom the Archancellor is the retired Dean of Unseen University), and was given the name Pex. Pex was apparently powered by chickens rather than ants, a technology which was considered superior as the eggs it provided were edible. Adrian Turnipseed was responsible for its construction and maintenance, using various technologies he had learned from Ponder while helping to build the original Hex. However, he had apparently not learned well enough, as a seventy-foot chicken broke out of the Higher Energy Magic Building and demolished much of Pseudopolis, and presumably Pex as well. ==Messages== Hex has a habit of spewing bizarre messages. Its \\"Out of Cheese\\" error from Interesting Times caught the fancy of many information technology employees, turning up in real-world systems and in programming books. It alludes to the many confusing error messages that technology users have had to put up with in the Information Age. \\"Out of Paper\\" (also seen as \\"PC LOAD LETTER\\" for some printers) is familiar to many office workers. \\"Redo From Start\\" was the somewhat unhelpful error message produced by the BASIC interpreter in many early home computers when non-numeric characters were entered in response to a prompt for numerical input. Other inscrutable Hex- talk includes: +++Mr. Jelly! Mr. Jelly!+++ +++Error At Address: 14, Treacle Mine Road, Ankh-Morpork+++ +++MELON MELON MELON+++ +++Divide By Cucumber Error. Please Reinstall Universe And Reboot +++ +++Whoops! Here Comes The Cheese! +++ +++Oneoneoneoneoneoneone+++ Hex's messages are often delimited by the sequence +++, which recalls the escape sequence in the Hayes command set, a standard used in dial-up modems. In the videogame Discworld II: Missing, Presumed..., if the player asks the question \\"Why?\\", Hex spits out various error messages different from those in the books: *Blip* *Blip* *Blip* End of Cheese Error *Blip* *Blip* *Blip* Can Not Find Drive Z: *Blip* *Blip* *Blip* Unknown Application Error *Blip* *Blip* *Blip* Please Reboot Universe *Blip* *Blip* *Blip* Year Of The Sloth *Blip* *Blip* *Blip* This echoes the science- fiction \\"does not compute\\" clich√©, in which the protagonist confuses, locks up, or destroys a dangerous computer by giving it riddles or making paradoxical statements such as \\"everything I say is a lie\\". ==Appearances== Hex appears in the books Interesting Times, Soul Music, Hogfather, The Last Continent, Going Postal, The Science of Discworld I, II and III, Making Money and Unseen Academicals and in the video game Discworld II: Missing Presumed...!? ==Real world connections== The inspiration for Hex, which evolves through seemingly unexplainable upgrades like extra cheese, the FTB protocol, a CWL (Clothes Wringer from the Laundry, for crunching numbers and other things), and \\"small religious pictures\\" (icons), came from Pratchett's own early experiments with upgrades on his ZX-81. The name is a play on several meanings of the word \\"hex\\": a hex can be a witch (hence the video game Hexen=witches) or a magical spell, and \\"hex\\" is slang for hexadecimal, the base 16 system used to simplify the representation of binary numbers and widely used in the IT world. \\"Hex\\" (\\"6\\" in Greek) also denotes the number of legs ants have; and refers to Hex, a game that encourages strategy and planning. In 2001, a new Silicon Graphics Origin 2800 supercomputer was installed as part of the University of Leicester's Centre for Mathematical Modelling and, with Pratchett's blessing, named HEX. In 2019, Hex GBL was provided as an answer for a practice exam associated with Chapter 6 of Western Governors University's \\"Managing Cloud Security\\" course.https://imgur.com/a/WM8EbgB ==References== Category:Fictional computers Category:Computer humor Category:Discworld characters ","title":"Hex (Discworld)"},{"id":"822138","text":"Ginn or GINN may refer to: *Ginn, a recurring character appearing in the television series Stargate Universe *GINN, a fictional, mechanical exoskeleton weapon suit, worn in the Mobile Suit Gundam SEED anime television series *Ginn (software), a daemon program for Linux that gives applications the ability to support a subset of multi-touch gestures on touch-sensitive displays *Ginn & Co Solicitors, a Cambridge-based law firm, which was established in 1873 by Samuel Reuben Ginn *Ginn and Company, UK publisher, part of the Penguin Group **Ginn Publishing Canada *Bobby Ginn (born 1949), the owner of Ginn Resorts and owner of the NASCAR Nextel Cup team Ginn Racing *Thomas Ginn (born 1972), Entrepreneur, Philanthropist, and Business Leader.

Although the geographic location of the Jianzhou Jurchens has changed throughout history, during the 14th century they were located south of the Wild Jurchens (Chinese: Èáé‰∫∫Â•≥Áúü) and the Haixi Jurchens (), inhabiting modern-day Liaoning () province and Jilin () province in China. The Jianzhou Jurchens were known to possess an abundant supply of natural resources. They also possessed industrial secrets, particularly in processing ginseng and the dyeing of cloth. They were powerful due to their proximity to Ming trading towns such as Fushun, Kaiyuan, and Tieling in Liaodong, and to Manpojin camp on the Korean border. == Origins == According to Pamela Crossley, a prominent historian specializing in Manchu history, the origin of the name Jianzhou is contested. Xu Zhongsha thought it was derived from the region of Parhae, from the Songari and Hun Rivers. Japanese scholars disagree and state that the name was created from the migrating Jurchens, near the present border with Korea. After the fall of the Yuan dynasty in 1368, pockets of Yuan loyalists retreated to the northeast. In 1375, a former Yuan official Naghachu residing in Liaoyang province invaded Liaodong with the hope of restoring the Yuan dynasty. After he was defeated in 1387, the Ming began reorganizing the Jurchens in Liaodong to protect the Ming border region from further incursions. Various Jurchen groups had migrated south and three tribes settled themselves around the Tumen River near the modern border of China, Russia, and North Korea. The Jianzhou Jurchen originate partially from the Huligai who were classified by the Liao dynasty as a separate ethnicity from the Jurchen people who founded the Jin dynasty and were classified as separate from Jurchens during the Yuan dynasty. Their home was in the lower reaches of the Songhua River and Mudanjiang. The Huligai later moved west and became a major component of the Jianzhou Jurchens led by Mentemu during the Ming dynasty, and the Jianzhou Jurchens later became Manchus. The Jurchens during the Ming dynasty lived in Jilin. According to the record of Ming Dynasty officialsÔºåThe Jianzhou Jurchen was descended from Mohe people who established Balhae Kingdom. The Taowen, Huligai, and Wodolian Jurchen tribes lived in the area of Heilongjiang in Yilan during the Yuan dynasty when it was part of Liaoyang province and governed as a circuit. These tribes became the Jianzhou Jurchens in the Ming dynasty. In the Jin dynasy, the Jin Jurchens did not regard themselves as the same tribes as the Hurka people who became the Huligai. Uriangqa was used as a name in the 1300s by Jurchen migrants in Korea from Ilantumen because the Uriangqa influenced the people at Ilantumen. Bokujiang, Tuowulian, Woduolian, Huligai, Taowan separately made up 30,000 households and were the divisions used by the Yuan dynasty to govern the people along the Wusuli river and Songhua area. In the Jin dynasty the Shangjing route ‰∏ä‰∫¨Ë∑Ø governed the Huligai. A Huligai route was created as well by the Jin. In 1388, the Hongwu Emperor established contact with three tribes of Ilan Tumen in modern Yilan County near the confluence of the Mudanjiang River and the Songhua River. The Odori, Huligai (H≈´rha or Hurka) and Tuowen Jurchens were enlisted as allies against the Mongols. Jurchens began accepting Ming titles. Ahacu, chief of the Huligai, became commander of the Jianzhou Guard in 1403, named after a Yuan Dynasty political unit in the area. M√∂ngke Tem√ºr (ÁåõÂì•Â∏ñÊú®ÂÑø) of the Odoli became the leader of the Jianzhou Left Guard and accepted the Chinese surname of Tong not long afterward. The two Jianzhou guards engaged in trade with the Ming at the designated market of Kaiyuan and Fushun. They undertook several short-term moves west, battling the Wild Jurchens of the north and the Koreans to their south. Jurchen raids into Korean territory brought about joint Korean-Ming counterattacks in 1467 and 1478 which severely weakened the Jianzhou Jurchens. Jianzhou Jurchens adopted agriculture during the Ming dynasty when they acquired knowledge of fertilization, draft animals, and iron plows as they moved south closer to Asian agricultural civilizations. Iron-smelting and mining knowledge was acquired by the Jurchens from 1599 after they bought iron plowshares from the Chinese and learned how to turn iron into weapons from Koreans. == Confederation building == By the mid-sixteenth century, the Ming guard structure had mostly disappeared and the Jurchens were split between two confederations: the Haixi Jurchens and the Jianzhou Jurchens. The Jianzhou confederates continued to live north of the Yalu River in five tribes: the Suksuhu River tribe, Hunehe, Wanggiya, Donggo, and Jecen. Under the leadership of Wang Gao, the confederation raided the Ming frontier and even killed the Ming commander at Fushun in 1473. A major counterattack by the Chinese ended in the death of Wang Gao and the dissolution of the confederation. In 1582, the Jianzhou confederation was met by the Ming military who launched a campaign which intended to stabilize the disintegrating confederation. The chieftain Nikan Wailan allied with the Ming general Li Chengliang against Wang Gao's son Atai. Giocangga, chief of the Beiles of the Sixes, was originally under Li's command since his grandson, the young Nurhaci was under his hostage. But Giocangga later chose to oppose Nikan Wailan and took his fourth son Taksi to support Atai at his stronghold Fort Gure. The battle at Gure, claimed Atai, Giocangga, and Taksi's lives. A number of leaders within the Suksuhu tribe stood ready to take Nurhaci's place. However, Nurhaci eventually rose to power. == Nurhaci and Leadership of Jianzhou Jurchens == Taking control of his grandfather's Suksuhu River tribe, Nurhaci confronted the Ming and released the Seven Grievances. Nurhaci sought vengeance for the untimely deaths of his immediate family members and a vendetta against the Ming forces who took his father and grandfather's life was launched. Although the Ming were reluctant, Nikan Wailan was eventually held responsible for the deaths of Giocangga and Taksi, and was killed in 1586. The Ming claimed that their deaths were accidental and not part of the campaign. Afterwards, Li Chengliang even acted as a surrogate father. Nurhaci may have had actually lived within Li Chengliang's household in Fushun in his youth and perhaps gained his literacy in Chinese as a result of this experience. Nurhaci would later be responsible for unifying the Jurchens confederacies. The leadership of the Jianzhou confederacies found its lineage from the Odori Jurchens whose leader Mongke Temur was renown by both the Ming and by the Yi. Giocangga, Nurgaci grandfather, claimed to be a fourth-generation descendant of Mongke Temur. The elite members of the Jurchen lineage possessed the Chinese characters for Jiagu in their names. In 1588 Nurhaci brought the Wanggiya tribe and Donggo tribe together. The unification of the Jianzhou Jurchens became a stepping stone for Nurhaci to expand his power throughout southern and central Manchuria, and to create a truly unified Manchu state. The very name Manchu (Jurchen: manju) was perhaps an old term for the Jianzhou Jurchens. == Language == Unlike the Jurchen people, who spoke the Jin Jurchen language that was adopted from phonetic Kitan language established in the Jin dynasty, the Jianzhou Jurchens commonly used three different language: Jurchen, Mongolian and Chinese. According to the Qing imperial history, the Jianzhou leader Nurgaci sought to devise a suitable system that integrated the phonetic Mongolian and Jurchen language. This resulted in the creation of the Manchu language, which would later be deemed one of the greatest inventions that sparked the unification of Manchuria. However, for some time the script was not well received and the Jianzhou continued to use Mongolian as their lingua franca. == Relationship with the Joseon dynasty == The Korean Joseon dynasty, incepted in the 1300s, had considered some Jurchen headmen as useful allies. Jurchens were positioned as far south as Hamhung in north central Korea since the 12th century. However, the Yi order in Korea included intense military campaigns to drive Jurchens northward toward the Yalu River and ultimately beyond it, into present-day Manchuria. One of the most vivid narratives and depictions of the Jianzhou comes from a passage supplied by Sin Chun-li. Sin Chun-li‚Äôs mission to the Jianzhou Jurchens was aimed to resolve the incident of 1594, in which the Jianzhou Jurchens captured at least seventeen Koreans and were being held for ransom. To resolve the issue, Sin was dispatched by the Korean court to Nurgaci's capital at Fe Ala. He and a small party of Korean officials crossed the Yalu river at Mamp Ojin, and followed a tributaries northwest to the Suksu Valley where Nurhaci was based. Sin kept a detailed written record of his journey as he moved through Jianzhou Jurchen confederation. Despite it being winter, his insights tell us that the Jianzhou land was abundant with rivers, forests, and saw industrialization. Sin stratified his findings and stated that the Jianzhou Jurchen divided their society into villages of about twenty households or less, which were clustered along forested riverbanks. They lived off of the river and its surrounding terrain. == Relationship with the Ming Dynasty == The Jianzhou Jurchens, and other Jurchen groups were often in contention with the Ming and Yi for rights to trade. They often contended at Nurgan and Liaodong, which were politically and culturally marked territories before the Conquest of Qing China. However, there was also simultaneously cohesion, which was reflected in the scheduled visits of Jurchen leaders to Peking to \\"make ritual obeisance\\" to the Ming emperor. These visits were to satisfy the Ming tributary system. Conversely, it helped the Ming establish a list of Jurchen elites and military occupancies, but also deescalated tensions between the two groups. Nurgaci conducted at least two of the tributaries - one with his father at a young age and another lead by himself. There, as early as 1580, he echoed the Jianzhou Jurchen elite's frustrations with the Ming officials in Liaodong. He established his grievances that the Ming officials were corrupt and often interfered with trading. However, the Jurchen were not viewed as a threat at this time by the Ming. The change of the name from Jurchen to Manchu was made to hide the fact that the ancestors of the Manchus, the Jianzhou Jurchens, were ruled by the Chinese. Via Dartmouth.edu The Qing dynasty carefully hide the 2 original editions of the books of \\"Qing Taizu Wu Huangdi Shilu\\" and the \\"Manzhou Shilu Tu\\" (Taizu Shilu Tu) in the Qing palace, forbidden from public view because they showed that the Manchu Aisin Gioro family had been ruled by the Ming dynasty. Via Dartmouth.edu In the Ming period, the Koreans of Joseon referred to the Jurchen inhabited lands north of the Korean peninsula, above the rivers Yalu and Tumen to be part of Ming China, as the \\"superior country\\" (sangguk) which they called Ming China. The Qing deliberately excluded references and information that showed the Jurchens (Manchus) as subservient to the Ming dynasty, from the History of Ming to hide their former subservient relationship to the Ming. The Veritable Records of Ming were not used to source content on Jurchens during Ming rule in the History of Ming because of this. == Trading along the border == Since Nurgaci came to power, he implemented a strengthening of the Jianzhou Jurchen's by way of amassing agricultural laborers. This was achieved in part through the kidnapping of farmers living in border regions. However, unlike previous rulers, the Jianzhou Jurchens under Nurhaci provided shelter and gave other benefits and resources to these farmers which helped ease assimilation and established their allegiance to Nurhaci's regime. Fushan was an \\"Tong ancestral town\\" and during the early 17th century, it was fortified by the Ming since it served as Liaodong's border that met with Nurgan - territories occupied by the Haixi, Jianzhou, and wild Jurchens. Fushan was the primacy licensed center for the trade, particularly renown for cured ginseng, horse trade, and dyed clothing. Fushan was also a primary location for Jianzhou embassy members who were conducting tributary missions to stop for entertainment and refreshments. In 1618, Nurgaci's forces captured Fushun. This escalated tensions and in 1621, the Jianzhou Jurchens broke out in warfare with the Ming in Liaodong in which Nurhaci fought with Xiong Tingbi (1569-1625), the Ming military commander. By this time, he had declared a unified Jurchen regime that called itself \\"Jin,\\" reminiscent of the former Jurchen empire. From this warfare, the Ming grew increasingly aware of Nurgaci's increasing and tremendous military power. Nurgaci, in 1622, convinced Mongol's who were supporting the Ming's military efforts, to abandon their posts and it resulted in a disastrous defeat for the Ming at Guangning. Nurhaci's troops soon occupied Shenyang, the former Ming provincial capitol. This battle helped strengthen the Jianzhou and established more relationships with surrounding groups. == See also == *List of Manchu clans *Gioccanga *Nurhaci *Jurchen people *Sinicization of the Manchus ==References== ==External links== *THE CAMBRIDGE HISTORY OF CHINA The Qing Empire To 1800 Category:History of Manchuria Category:Jurchens Category:Ming dynasty ","title":"Jianzhou Jurchens"},{"id":"822142","text":"Opening logoGainsborough Pictures was a British film studio based on the south bank of the Regent's Canal, in Poole Street, Hoxton in the former Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch, north London.

Whilst Gaumont-British, based at Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd's Bush produced the \\"quality\\" pictures, Gainsborough mainly produced 'B' movies and melodramas at its Islington Studios. Both studios used continental film practices, especially those from (Germany), with Alfred Hitchcock being encouraged by Balcon‚Äîwho had links with UFA‚Äîto study there and make multilingual co-production films with UFA, before the war. In the 1930s, actors Elisabeth Bergner and Conrad Veidt, art director Alfred Junge, cinematographer Mutz Greenbaum and screenwriter/director Berthold Viertel, along with others, joined the two studios.BritMovie biography of the studio .

The short piece of music was written by Louis Levy and called the Gainsborough Minuet. After the departure of Balcon to MGM-British, the Rank Organisation gained an interest in Gainsborough and the studio made such popular films as Oh, Mr Porter! (1937) and Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes (1938). By 1937, Gaumont-British were in financial crisis, and closed their Lime Grove studios, moving all production to the Islington Poole Street studio.

Prominent titles included The Man in Grey (1943), Madonna of the Seven Moons (1944), Fanny by Gaslight (1944), The Wicked Lady (1945) and Caravan (1946). The films featured a stable of leading British actors, among them Margaret Lockwood, James Mason, Stewart Granger and Patricia Roc.

Subsequent productions, overseen by Betty Box (who at the time was the only female producer in British cinema), included the neo-realist Holiday Camp (1947), Miranda (1948) and the Huggett family series with Jack Warner, Kathleen Harrison, and Petula Clark who were introduced in Holiday Camp. Unhappy with the performance of the studio, Rank closed it down in early 1949. Production was concentrated at Pinewood Studios. Although at first films continued to be made there under the Gainsborough banner, this quickly ceased and no further Gainsborough films were released after 1951. They were revived in 1987 and made the film, A Hazard of Hearts ==Demolition== The original Lime Grove site was taken over by the BBC in 1949 and remained in use until it was closed in 1991.

The former Islington Studios, in Poole Street, remained largely derelict after their closure in 1949 apart from occasional art performances, including two epic Shakespearean productions by the Almeida Theatre Company, April‚ÄìJuly 2000, directed by Jonathan Kent and starring Ralph Fiennes, and a closing Hitchcock season in October 2003.The final reel ‚Äì The Guardian 27 September 2003 .

Matters heard by a divisional court include some criminal cases in the High Court (including appeals from magistrates' courts and in extradition proceedings) as well as certain judicial review cases. Although often referred to in practice as the Divisional Court, a divisional court is in fact not a separate court or division of the High Court but essentially refers to the number of judges sitting. Usually a divisional court sits with two judges but occasionally the bench comprises three judges (as it did in the recent appeal concerning disclosure of MPs' expenses, where the court comprised the President of the Queen's Bench Division, a Lord Justice of Appeal and a High Court Judge). The best known divisional court is that of the Administrative Court, which is a specialist court in the Queen's Bench Division which deals with criminal and judicial review cases. There are also divisional courts of the Family and Chancery Divisions to deal with certain cases. The usual constitution of a divisional court is one Lord Justice of Appeal and one High Court judge, in comparison to other sittings of the High Court which are usually before a single High Court judge. ==See also== *Full Court ==References== Category:High Court of Justice ","title":"Divisional court (England and Wales)"},{"id":"822146","text":"The Wicked Lady is a 1945 costume drama film directed by Leslie Arliss and starring Margaret Lockwood in the title role as a nobleman's wife who becomes a highwayman for the excitement. The film had one of the top audiences for a film of its period, 18.4 million.Channel 4, top 100 film audiences It was one of the Gainsborough melodramas, a sequence of very popular films made during the 1940s. Filmink magazine said \\"if you only see one Gainsborough melodrama, this is the one to check out.\\" The story was based on the novel Life and Death of the Wicked Lady Skelton by Magdalen King-Hall which, in turn, was based upon the (disputed) events surrounding the life of Lady Katherine Ferrers, the wife of the major landowner in Markyate on the main London‚ÄìBirmingham road. The film was loosely remade by Michael Winner as The Wicked Lady in 1983. ==Plot== Caroline (Patricia Roc) invites her beautiful, green-eyed friend Barbara (Margaret Lockwood) to her forthcoming wedding to wealthy landowner and local magistrate Sir Ralph Skelton (Griffith Jones). The scheming Barbara soon has Sir Ralph entranced. Caroline, wishing only his happiness, stands aside, and even allows Barbara to persuade her to be her maid of honour so as to lessen the scandal of the abrupt change of brides. At the wedding reception, Barbara meets a handsome stranger, Kit Locksby (Michael Rennie). It is love at first sight for both, but too late. Married life in the country does not provide the new Lady Skelton with the excitement she expected and craves. A visit by her detested sister-in-law Henrietta, Lady Kingsclere (Enid Stamp-Taylor), and her husband (Francis Lister) does not lessen her boredom. In a game of Ombre, Henrietta wins Barbara's jewels, including her most-prized possession, her late mother's ruby brooch. A chance remark about the notorious highwayman Captain Jerry Jackson gives Barbara an idea. Masquerading as Jackson, Barbara holds up Henrietta's coach and retrieves her brooch (as well as the rest of Henrietta's jewellery). Intoxicated by the experience, she continues to waylay coaches until one night, she and the real Captain Jackson (James Mason) target the same one. After they relieve the passengers of their valuables and escape, Jackson is amused to find his competitor is a beautiful woman. They become lovers and partners in crime. She warns him never to be unfaithful to her with another woman. Barbara learns of a planned gold shipment from a former tenant farmer of Skelton's, Ned Cotterill (Emrys Jones), who has been employed as one of the guards. Jackson is against the idea of hijacking the gold, as the coach will have double the usual protection, but Barbara talks him into it. However, the robbery does not go smoothly. When Cotterill pursues them, Barbara shoots at his horse to stop him, but kills Cotterill by accident. However, her conscience is not disturbed for long. Hogarth (Felix Aylmer), an aged family servant, discovers Barbara's double life. However, his religious fervour to save her and her convincing lies about repenting keep him from revealing what he knows. Barbara tries to silence him for good with doses of poison and, when he starts to suspect her, by smothering him. She then visits Jackson after her prolonged inactivity caused by the danger posed by Hogarth, but finds him in bed with a woman. Infuriated, she anonymously betrays him to her husband. Jackson is captured and sentenced to be hanged. In London, Barbara goes to view the execution with Caroline, terrified that he will name her as his accomplice in his address from the scaffold. However, he only mentions her indirectly. When a riot breaks out afterward, the two ladies are rescued by none other than Kit, who turns out to be engaged to Caroline. The riot allows Jackson's accomplices to cut him down, and he survives. He breaks into Barbara's bedroom at the Skelton estate and rapes her. Fearful of what he may do next, she begs Kit to take her out of England to start a new life. He is tempted, but is finally determined to honour his obligation to Caroline. Barbara decides to free herself of Ralph. She awaits her husband's coach with a loaded pistol. Jackson shows up to claim partnership in the caper, but when he learns what Barbara intends, it is too much even for him. He intends to warn Skelton, but Barbara shoots and kills him to prevent him. When the coach with Caroline, Ralph and Kit arrives, she hijacks it and attempts to shoot her husband. Kit shoots her first and, injured, she escapes on horseback. Mortally wounded, she flees to her home, where Caroline finds her and ascertains the truth. Caroline sends Kit in alone to see the dying woman. At first, Barbara lies about how she was shot; however, she cannot continue the deceit with her one true love. She confesses all and pleads with Kit to stay with her until the end, but he is repulsed by the magnitude of her crimes and leaves her to die alone. After her death, Caroline and Ralph reunite, determined to put the past behind them and live happily together. ==Cast== *Margaret Lockwood as Barbara Worth *James Mason as Captain Jerry Jackson *Patricia Roc as Caroline *Griffith Jones as Sir Ralph Skelton *Michael Rennie as Kit Locksby *Felix Aylmer as Hogarth *Enid Stamp Taylor as Lady Kingsclere *Francis Lister as Lord Kingsclere *Beatrice Varley as Aunt Moll *Amy Dalby as Aunt Doll *Martita Hunt as Cousin Agatha *David Horne as Martin Worth *Emrys Jones as Ned Cotterill *Helen Goss as Mistress Betsy *Muriel Aked as Mrs. Munce ==Production== Magdalen King-Hall's Life and Death of the Wicked Lady Skelton was published in 1944. Mason, Lockwood and Arliss' involvement in the movie adaptation was announced in November of that year. Lockwood later wrote in her memoirs \\"this was an enchantingly 'wicked' part. At first, as usual, I did not like the thought of playing a villainous role again, but it was such a good one that I knew it would be madness to refuse it.\\" In a 1945 issue of Picturegoer, Arliss said that it was Eleanor Smith (author of the book which inspired his 1943 hit The Man in Grey) who gave him King-Hall's novel. He went on to say: > I told Maurice Ostrer of Gainsborough Pictures that I had found my ideal > film subject and found that he had already purchased the rights himself! The > character of Barbara is wicked enough even for me, and how vastly > interesting is this most complex character as it develops through the action > of the story. Caroline, the character played by Roc, is a movie script addition, not existing in the novel. Stewart Granger turned down the role that Mason played. Lockwood practiced riding for the role and added a black beauty spot.Lockwood p 108 ===Shooting=== Filming started March 1945. The film was made at Gainsborough Studios in London with location shooting at Blickling Hall in Norfolk. Lockwood wrote \\"we enjoyed making that film together. We did not enjoy remaking it, exactly one year later\\" when they had to re shoot scenes for American censors.Lockwood p 109 ==British reception== The Wicked Lady was the most popular film at the British box office in 1946.Robert Murphy, Realism and Tinsel: Cinema and Society in Britain 1939‚Äì48 2003 p209 According to Kinematograph Weekly the \\"biggest winner\\" at the box office in 1946 Britain was The Wicked Lady, with \\"runners up\\" being The Bells of St Marys, Piccadilly Incident, The Road to Utopia, Tomorrow is Forever, Brief Encounter, Wonder Man, Anchors Away, Kitty, The Captive Heart, The Corn is Green, Spanish Main, Leave Her to Heaven, Gilda, Caravan, Mildred Pierce, Blue Dahlia, Years Between, O.S.S., Spellbound, Courage of Lassie, My Reputation, London Town, Caesar and Cleopatra, Meet the Navy, Men of Two Worlds, Theirs is the Glory, The Overlanders, and Bedelia. ==US release== Problems with American censors made extensive re-shooting necessary before the film was released in the United States (according to Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies). The problems were that the women's dress bodices (appropriate for the era portrayed) were very low-cut and showed too much cleavage for the USA motion picture production code. It was a problem Jane Russell had in The Outlaw (1943). TCM sometimes airs the original, uncensored version on its USA basic cable network. Margaret Lockwood said \\"We had to do nine days of retakes to satisfy the censor on that film and it all seemed very foolish.\\" Mason said \\"I don't like it now\\", referring to the film after the changes. ==Proposed sequel== Maurice Ostrer reportedly wanted to make a sequel but this was vetoed by J.

In British English it is also commonly known as an advert in a lonely hearts column. With its rise in popularity, the World Wide Web has also become a common medium for personals, commonly referred to as online dating. Personals are generally meant to generate romance, friendship, or casual (sometimes sexual) encounters, and usually include a basic description of the person posting it, and their interests. Newspapers and magazines that take personal advertisements often provide a reply forwarding service; in this case, the text of the advert will include a unique box number and anyone wishing to reply to the advert sends or delivers their reply to the publisher's address in an envelope bearing that number. The publisher forwards replies in bulk to the advertiser at a given interval, for example each week. Another method of replying to Lonely Hearts adverts is via telephone; this took off with the introduction of premium-rate telephone numbers, providing an additional way for the publisher to generate money. The usual business model is for the advertiser to be enticed to place an advert free of charge (using an 0800 number or equivalent); those replying (and also the advertiser, when they want to check for any replies) must use a premium-rate line. Due to newspaper prices being based on characters or lines of text, a jargon of abbreviations, acronyms and code words arose in personals and have often carried over to the internet. ==List of single-letter abbreviations== The following are examples of single-letter abbreviations used in three-letter acronyms (TLAs). If a personal advert includes a TLA, it could be to describe the person who is seeking and/or the kind of person they seek; for example, an advert stating 'DLF for SJT' means that a divorced Latina female is searching for a single Jewish transgender person. ===First letter=== The first letter often describes the relationship state or sexuality of the person: * D: Divorced * G: Gay * M: Married * S: Single * W: Widow or Widower ===Middle letter=== The middle letter generally represents the ethnicity or nationality of the person posting the ad. Can be replaced by 4, standing for the word for (\\"seeking\\", \\"desires\\", etc.). * A: Asian * B: Black * H: Hispanic * J: Jewish or Japanese * L: Latino or Latina * W: White ===Last letter=== The third letter commonly describes the gender of the person (or couple, if that is who is seeking or sought). * C: Couple * F: Female * M: Male (or Man) * T: Transgender * W: Woman ==List of miscellaneous abbreviations== As well as three-letter abbreviations of the format described above, a number of other acronyms and abbreviated words have been popular in personal adverts at different times and in different places.

Marmaris' main source of income is tourism. It is located between two intersecting sets of mountains by the sea, though following a construction boom in the 1980s, little is left of the sleepy fishing village that Marmaris was until the late 20th century. In 2010, the city's population was 30,957, and peaks at around 300,000 to 400,000 people during the tourist season. It is also a centre for sailing and diving, possessing two major and several smaller marinas. It is a popular wintering location for hundreds of cruising boaters, being also served by the nearby Dalaman Airport. ==Climate== Beaches of Marmaris Marmaris has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen: Csa) characterised by a hot dry summers and mild rainy winters. Showers and rain are very unlikely between May and October. Summers are hot and dry, and temperatures are especially high during the heatwaves in July and August. October is still warm and bright, though with spells of rain, and many tourists prefer to visit in the early autumn, especially in September, because the temperatures are not as hot. Winters are mild and wet. Winter is the rainy season, with major precipitation falling after November. The annual rainfall can reach to 1,232.7 millimetres (48.531 in); the rainfall is concentrated during scattered days in winter falling in heavy cloudbursts which cause flash floods sometimes in flood prone areas. ==History== Map of Marmaris by Piri Reis Karaca in Marmaris Although it is not certain when Marmaris was founded, in the 6th century BC the site was known as Physkos (), also Latinized as Physcus, and was in a part of Caria that belonged to Rhodes, contained a magnificent harbour and a grove sacred to Leto.Strabo, Geography, xiv; Stadiasmus Maris Magni ¬ß 245; Ptol., Geography 5.2.11. According to the historian Herodotus, there had been a castle on the site since 3000 BC. In 334 BC, Caria was invaded by Alexander the Great and the castle of Physkos was besieged. The 600 inhabitants of the town realised that they had no chance against the invading army and burned their valuables in the castle before escaping to the hills with their women and children. The invaders, well aware of the strategic value of the castle, repaired the destroyed sections to house a few hundred soldiers before the main army returned home. The city became known as Marmaris during the period of the Beylik of Mente≈üe; the name derives from Greek m√†rmaron (marble), in Turkish mermer, in reference to the rich deposits of marble in the region, and the prominent role of the city's port in the marble trade. Marmaris Castle Sehir Island in Marmaris In the mid- fifteenth century, Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror conquered and united the various tribes and kingdoms of Anatolia and the Balkans, and acquired Constantinople. The Knights of St. John, based in Rhodes had fought the Ottoman Turks for many years; they also withstood the onslaughts of Mehmed II. When sultan Suleiman the Magnificent set out for the conquest of Rhodes, Marmaris served as a base for the Ottoman Navy and Marmaris Castle was rebuilt from scratch in 1522. In 1801 a British force of 120 ships under Admiral Keith and 14,000 troops under General Abercromby anchored in the bay for eight weeks, training and resupplying for their mission to end the French campaign in Egypt and Syria. The 1957 Fethiye earthquakes almost completely destroyed the city. Only the Marmaris Castle and the historic buildings surrounding the fortress were left undamaged. Since 1979, renovation work has been continuing at the castle. Under the auspices of the Ministry of Culture, the castle was converted into a museum. There are seven galleries. The largest is used as an exhibition hall, the courtyard is decorated with seasonal flowers. Built at the same time as the castle in the bazaar, there is also a small Ottoman caravanserai built by Suleiman's mother Ay≈üe Hafsa Sultan. ==Archaeology== In 2018, archaeologists discovered the 2300 year-old tomb of the ancient Greek boxer Diagoras near the city of Marmaris. They announced that a pyramid-shaped structure was the mausoleum of the Greek boxer. The following words were inscribed in Greek on the mausoleum: ‚ÄúI will be vigilant at the very top so as to ensure that no coward can come and destroy this grave,‚Äù Until 1970, the structure was believed to be the grave of a saint and was visited by locals seeking answers to their prayers, but upon discovery that it was not a holy site, the structure was looted. ==Natural history== Nimara Cave on Heaven Island Heaven Island in Marmaris Nimara Cave is a cave on Heaven Island near Marmaris. Since ancient times, the cave was used as a place of worship. According to the ancient Greek historian Herodotus, human presence in the cave (as well as the old city of Physkos, today called Marmaris), dates back to 3000 BC. However, excavations carried out by the Municipality of Marmaris in 2007 extended this period to almost 12,000 years back. The research conducted in the cave has revealed the existence of a cult of Mother Goddess Leto, believed to be the mother of God Apollo and Goddess Artemis, in the ancient city of Physkos. The cave is located at the highest point of Heaven Island and was used as a place of worship by the ancient residents of the town of Nimara. The worshipping took place around the main rock that exists even today. This main rock is surrounded by stone altars in a semi-circle raised at about 30 cm from the ground. Offerings to the Mother Goddess Leto were placed on these elevated stones. The offerings were made in the form of cremations, glass beads, terracotta, and sculptures of Leto. The cave was also in use during the Roman period. Nimara Cave has been declared a protected area in 1999. It shelters trogloxene butterflies, identical to those living in Fethiye's Butterfly Valley (). The Marmaris peninsula is the westernmost habitat for Tulipa armena, which normally grows in Eastern Turkey, Iran, and Transcaucasia at much higher altitudes.Anna Pavord, The Tulip (London, Bloomsbury 1999) 289 The plants may have been introduced during the Ottoman period. ==Sports== The Final Four matches of the 2013 Men's European Volleyball League were held at the Amiral Orhan Aydƒ±n Sports Hall in Marmaris from July 13 to 14, 2013. The Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey () is a professional road bicycle racing stage race held each spring. Being an almost perfect setting for sailing, every year in late October Marmaris hosts an annual regatta attracting international as well as Turkish boats and crews. Marmaris has much to offer for outdoor sports lovers. Visitors may do variety of great outsports in Marmaris such as going on 4WD drives, jeep safari, quad & buggy safari, bike rides, forest rides on mountain bikes, sailing catamaran trips, jet-ski rides, canoeing, rafting, climbing, diving, paintball, horseback riding, mountain hikes, hang gliding, karting and more. From 2018, Marmaris is scheduled to host a round of the FIA World Rally Championship. ==International relationsTwin towns/Sister cities=== Marmaris is twinned with: * F√ºrth, Germany * Jinan, China * Ordu, Turkey * Ashkelon, Israel * Dzerzhinsky, Russia ==See also== * Nimara Cave * Heaven Island * Gulf of G√∂kova * Turkish Riviera ==References== ==External links== * Category:Turkish Riviera Category:National parks of Turkey Category:Mediterranean port cities and towns in Turkey Category:Populated places in Muƒüla Province Category:Tourist attractions in Muƒüla Province Category:Populated coastal places in Turkey Category:Districts of Muƒüla Province Category:Ancient Greek tombs Category:Greek colonies in Caria ","title":"Marmaris"},{"id":"822186","text":"Liathach seen from Beinn Eighe. With the Munro top of St√πc a' Choire Dhuibh Bhig (915 metres) in the foreground and the two Munro summits in the background. Liathach is a mountain in the Torridon Hills. At a height of , it lies to the north of the A896 road, in the Northwest Highlands of Scotland, and has two peaks of Munro status: Spidean a' Choire L√®ith at the east of the main ridge, and Mullach an Rathain at the western end of the mountain. The name is pronounced in Scottish Gaelic, and means 'The grey one'. When seen from the roadside below, its slopes appear to rise up in a series of near vertical rocky terraces. ==Geology== The mountain is composed of Torridonian sandstone which forms massive near-horizontal strata. They form the numerous terraces that are obvious from afar. The rocks are mainly red and chocolate sandstones, arkoses, flagstones and shales with coarse conglomerates locally at the base. Some of the materials of these rocks were derived from the underlying Lewisian gneiss, upon the uneven surface of which they rest, but the bulk of the material was obtained from rocks that are nowhere now exposed. Upon this ancient denuded land surface the Torridonian strata rest horizontally or with gentle inclination. Some of the peaks, such as Beinn Eighe, are capped with white quartzite, giving them a distinctive appearance when seen from afar. Some of the quartzite contains fossilized worm burrows and is known as pipe rock. It is about 500 million years old. The Torridon landscape is itself highly denuded by glacial and alluvial action, and represents the remnants of an ancient peneplain. ==Challenging traverse== The traverse of the hill including both of the above peaks is a challenging expedition; the intervening ridge is for the most part a series of rocky pinnacles known as Am Fasarinen (The Teeth), which reaches a height of 927 metres at the western end and is considered a Munro \\"top\\". There are few places on the ridge for descent, so once committed, the walker has little choice but to complete the entire ridge walk. The pinnacles can however be avoided by means of a narrow path that traverses the ridge on the south side. The path is very exposed, and there is much erosion at points where it crosses any of a series of gullies. In winter the traverse of Liathach becomes an even more serious expedition. ==Tops== Liathach has four listed \\"Tops\\" in the Munro Tables, Meall Dearg at 3133 feet (955 m) stands off the main ridge at the end of the Northern Pinnacles which run north from Mullach an Rathain. The route along the Northern Pinnacles is considered a rock climb, although another route to the top from Coire na Caime only involves a short steep scramble on the final 50m to gain the ridge. Irvine Butterfield considers Meall Dearg \\"The most difficult top in the British Isles challenged only by the Inaccessible Pinnacle of Sg√πrr Dearg\\".\\"The Munros and Tops\\" Page 174 Gives details of Meall Dearg.\\"The High Mountains of Britain and Ireland\\" Page 223 Gives quote from Butterfield and route from Coire na Caime. The Northern Pinnacles were first climbed in 1894 by Hinxman, Rennie and Douglas. ==Routes== There are few obvious routes up or down. Routes to each of the two Munro summits exist, following the course of two small burns to give a steep ascent or descent from the ridge. The western end of Liathach, beyond Mullach an Rathain, drops more gently to sea level than any of the burns. ==References in popular culture== Scottish singer Jo Hamilton named a song after Liathach on her debut album Gown. The song was subsequently covered by Prince on his 2013 Live Out Loud tour. ==See also== * Highlands of Scotland * North-West Highlands == References == * The Munros and Tops, Chris Townsend, * The High Mountains of Britain and Ireland, Irvine Butterfield, Footnotes ==External links== * Liathach is at coordinates Category:Munros Category:Marilyns of Scotland Category:Mountains and hills of the Northwest Highlands Category:Torridon Category:Climbing areas of Scotland Category:One-thousanders of the British Isles ","title":"Liathach"},{"id":"822197","text":"Westmoreland County Community College is a public community college in Youngwood, Pennsylvania.

He was also a leading authority on Gilbert White and made over 1,000 radio and television broadcasts on natural history subjects. ==Early life== Fisher was the son of Kenneth Fisher (also a keen ornithologist and headmaster of Oundle School from 1922 to 1945); his maternal uncle was the Cheshire naturalist Arnold Boyd. He was educated at Eton, and began studying medicine at Magdalen College, Oxford, but later switched to zoology. He took part in the Oxford Arctic expedition in 1933 as ornithologist. ==Career== After university he joined London Zoo as an assistant curator, and during the war studied rooks for the Ministry of Agriculture. He later became a leading member of the RSPB and IUCN, a member of the National Parks Commission and vice-chairman of the Countryside Commission. He presented the BBC Radio series Birds In Britain from its inception in March 1951 until its end, twelve years later. Fisher was one of the members of the small party that on 18 September 1955 raised the Union Flag and took official possession for the UK of the tiny, uninhabited, rocky islet of Rockall, in the North Atlantic. As well as writing his own books, he was an editor of Collins' New Naturalist series. He was the resident ornithologist in the regular \\"Nature Parliament\\" series broadcast in the 1950s on BBC radio as part of Children's Hour. It is likely that his writing and broadcasting played a significant role in the growth of interest in birdwatching in the United Kingdom in the post-Second World War period. He was awarded the British Trust for Ornithology's Bernard Tucker Medal in 1966. ==Personal life== He was married to Margery Lilian Edith Turner, and they had six children, including the publisher Edmund Fisher. He died in a car crash in September 1970. ==Legacy== After Fisher's death he was commemorated in two ways. A public appeal allowed the seabird island of Copinsay, Orkney, to be purchased as a permanent nature reserve dedicated to his name.Fisher, James Maxwell McConnell (1912‚Äì1970), ornithologist by Gwynne Vevers, rev.

In it, Sir John Dynham and the Earl of Warwick, Captain of Calais, on the Yorkist side, defeated a Lancastrian fleet and captured several of its ships. Little evidence and few details of the battle survive. ==Battle== Edward, Earl of March and Richard, Earl of Salisbury, had fled to the English stronghold of Calais after their defeat at the Battle of Ludford Bridge.Michael K.

Once the town of Sandwich itself had been secured by his forces in June 1460, Warwick landed there with March and Salisbury on 26 June 1460. Having cleared the Channel of French pirates (who had been able to raid the town thanks to the chaos caused in England by the civil war) and having made the coast of Kent safe, Warwick was received in Kent as a hero. Warwick's army soon increased in numbers, joined by many new recruits, and was largely well supported as it proceeded by way of Canterbury and probably Wickhambreaux. The Yorkist commanders had remained popular in Kent, and the officers in charge of protecting the county against them even joined forces with the rebels. The growing army then marched on London, where it arrived on 2 July to be welcomed by William Hulin, Lord Mayor of London, and Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury. The Yorkist army then marched towards Northampton to meet Henry VI and his Lancastrian army, and the two forces met at the Battle of Northampton on 10 July. ==Sources and references== Category:1460 in England Sandwich 1460 Category:Conflicts in 1460 Category:15th century in Kent ","title":"Battle of Sandwich (1460)"},{"id":"822222","text":"Les Allues is a commune in the Savoie department in the Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes region in south-eastern France.

Competition can occur when females have multiple potential mating partners. Greater choice and variety of mates increases a female's chance to produce more viable offspring. However, multiple mates for a female means each individual male has decreased chances of producing offspring. Sperm competition is an evolutionary pressure on males, and has led to the development of adaptations to increase males' chance of reproductive success. Sperm competition results in a sexual conflict of interest between males and females. Males have evolved several defensive tactics including: mate-guarding, mating plugs, and releasing toxic seminal substances to reduce female re-mating tendencies to cope with sperm competition. Offensive tactics of sperm competition involve direct interference by one male on the reproductive success of another male, for instance by physically removing another male's sperm prior to mating with a female. For an example, see Gryllus bimaculatus. Sperm competition is often compared to having tickets in a raffle; a male has a better chance of winning (i.e. fathering offspring) the more tickets he has (i.e. the more sperm he inseminates a female with). However, sperm are not free to produce,Olsson et al., 1997; Wedell et al., 2002 and as such males are predicted to produce sperm of a size and number that will maximize their success in sperm competition. By making many spermatozoa, males can buy more \\"raffle tickets\\", and it is thought that selection for numerous sperm has contributed to the evolution of anisogamy with very small sperm (because of the energy trade-off between sperm size and number). Alternatively, a male may evolve faster sperm to enable his sperm to reach and fertilize the female's ovum first. Dozens of adaptations have been documented in males that help them succeed in sperm competition. ==Defensive adaptations== Neolamprologus pulcher Mate-guarding is a defensive behavioral trait that occurs in response to sperm competition; males try to prevent other males from approaching the female (and/or vice versa) thus preventing their mate from engaging in further copulations. Precopulatory and postcopulatory mate-guarding occurs in birds, lizards, insects and primates. Mate-guarding also exists in the fish species Neolamprologus pulcher, as some males try to \\"sneak\\" matings with females in the territory of other males. In these instances the males guard their female by keeping them in close enough proximity so that if an opponent male shows up in his territory he will be able to fight off the rival male which will prevent the female from engaging in extra-pair copulation with the rival male. Organisms with polygynous mating systems are controlled by one dominant male. In this type of mating system, the male is able to mate with more than one female in a community. The dominant males will reign over the community until another suitor steps up and overthrows him. The current dominant male will defend his title as the dominant male and he will also be defending the females he mates with and the offspring he sires. The elephant seal falls into this category since he can participate in bloody violent matches in order to protect his community and defend his title as the alpha male. If the alpha male is somehow overthrown by the newcomer, his children will most likely be killed and the new alpha male will start over with the females in the group so that his lineage can be passed on. Strategic mate-guarding occurs when the male only guards the female during her fertile periods. This strategy can be more effective because it may allow the male to engage in both extra-pair paternity and within-pair paternity. This is also because it is energetically efficient for the male to guard his mate at this time. There is a lot of energy that is expended when a male is guarding his mate. For instance, in polygynous mate-guarding systems, the energetic costs of males is defending their title as alpha male of their community. Fighting is very costly in regards to the amount of energy used to guard their mate. These bouts can happen more than once which takes a toll on the physical well- being of the male. Another cost of mate-guarding in this type of mating system is the potential increase of the spread of disease. If one male has an STD he can pass that to the females that he's copulating with potentially resulting in a depletion of the harem. This would be an energetic cost towards both genders for the reason that instead of using the energy for reproduction, they are redirecting it towards ridding themselves of this illness. Some females also benefit from polygyny because extra pair copulations in females increase the genetic diversity with the community of that species. This occurs because the male is not able to watch over all of the females and some will become promiscuous. Eventually, the male will not have the proper nutrition which makes the male unable to produce sperm. For instance, male amphipods will deplete their reserves of glycogen and triglycerides only to have it replenished after the male is done guarding that mate. Also, if the amount of energy intake does not equal the energy expended, then this could be potentially fatal to the male. Males may even have to travel long distances during the breeding season in order to find a female which absolutely drain their energy supply. Studies were conducted to compare the cost of foraging of fish that migrate and animals that are residential. The studies concluded that fish that were residential had fuller stomachs containing higher quality of prey compared to their migrant counterparts. With all of these energy costs that go along with guarding a mate, timing is crucial so that the male can use the minimal amount of energy. This is why it is more efficient for males to choose a mate during their fertile periods. Also, males will be more likely to guard their mate when there is a high density of males in the proximity. Sometimes organisms put in all this time and planning into courting a mate in order to copulate and she may not even be interested. There is a risk of cuckoldry of some sort since a rival male can successfully court the female that the male originally courting her could not do. However, there are benefits that are associated with mate-guarding. In a mating- guarding system, both parties, male and female, are able to directly and indirectly benefit from this. For instance, females can indirectly benefit from being protected by a mate. The females can appreciate a decrease in predation and harassment from other males while being able to observe her male counterpart. This will allow her to recognize particular traits that she finds ideal so that she'll be able to find another male that emulates those qualities. In polygynous relationships, the dominant male of the community benefits because he has the best fertilization success. Communities can include 30 up to 100 females and, compared to the other males, will greatly increase his chances of mating success. Males who have successfully courted a potential mate will attempt to keep them out of sight of other males before copulation. One way organisms accomplish this is to move the female to a new location. Certain butterflies, after enticing the female, will pick her up and fly her away from the vicinity of potential males. In other insects, the males will release a pheromone in order to make their mate unattractive to other males or the pheromone masks her scent completely. Certain crickets will participate in a loud courtship until the female accepts his gesture and then it suddenly becomes silent. Some insects, prior to mating, will assume tandem positions to their mate or position themselves in a way to prevent other males from attempting to mate with that female. The male checkerspot butterfly has developed a clever method in order to attract and guard a mate. He will situate himself near an area that possesses valuable resources that the female needs. He will then drive away any males that come near and this will greatly increase his chances of copulation with any female that comes to that area. In post-copulatory mate- guarding males are trying to prevent other males from mating with the female that they have mated with already. For example, male millipedes in Costa Rica will ride on the back of their mate letting the other males know that she's taken. Japanese beetles will assume a tandem position to the female after copulation. This can last up to several hours allowing him to ward off any rival males giving his sperm a high chance to fertilize that female's egg. These, and other, types of methods have the male playing defense by protecting his mate. Elephant seals are known to engage in bloody battles in order to retain their title has dominant male so that they are able to mate with all the females in their community. Indian mealmoth Drosophila melanogaster Copulatory plugs are frequently observed in insects, reptiles, some mammals, and spiders. Copulatory plugs are inserted immediately after a male copulates with a female, which reduce the possibility of fertilization by subsequent copulations from another male, by physically blocking the transfer of sperm. Bumblebee mating plugs, in addition to providing a physical barrier to further copulations, contain linoleic acid, which reduces re-mating tendencies of females. A species of Sonoran desert Drosophila, Drosophila mettleri, uses copulatory plugs to enable males to control the sperm reserve space females have available. This behavior ensures males with higher mating success at the expense of female control of sperm (sperm selection). Similarly, Drosophila melanogaster males release toxic seminal fluids, known as ACPs (accessory gland proteins), from their accessory glands to impede the female from participating in future copulations. These substances act as an anti- aphrodisiac causing a dejection of subsequent copulations, and also stimulate ovulation and oogenesis. Seminal proteins can have a strong influence on reproduction, sufficient to manipulate female behavior and physiology. Another strategy, known as sperm partitioning, occurs when males conserve their limited supply of sperm by reducing the quantity of sperm ejected. In Drosophila, ejaculation amount during sequential copulations is reduced; this results in half filled female sperm reserves following a single copulatory event, but allows the male to mate with a larger number of females without exhausting his supply of sperm. To facilitate sperm partitioning, some males have developed complex ways to store and deliver their sperm. In the blue headed wrasse, Thalassoma bifasciatum, the sperm duct is sectioned into several small chambers that are surrounded by a muscle that allows the male to regulate how much sperm is released in one copulatory event. A strategy common among insects is for males to participate in prolonged copulations. By engaging in prolonged copulations a male has an increased opportunity to place more sperm within the female's reproductive tract and prevent the female from copulating with other males. It has been found that some male mollies (Poecilia) have developed deceptive social cues to combat sperm competition. Focal males will direct sexual attention toward typically non-preferred females when an audience of other males is present. This encourages the males that are watching to attempt to mate with the non-preferred female. This is done in an attempt to decrease mating attempts with the female that the focal male prefers, hence decreasing sperm competition. ==Offensive adaptations== Offensive adaptation behavior differs from defensive behavior because it involves an attempt to ruin the chances of another male's opportunity in succeeding in copulation by engaging in an act that tries to terminate the fertilization success of the previous male. This offensive behavior is facilitated by the presence of certain traits, which are called armaments. An example of an armament are antlers. Further, the presence of an offensive trait sometimes serves as a status signal. The mere display of an armament can suffice to drive away the competition without engaging in a fight, hence saving energy. A male on the offensive side of mate-guarding may terminate the guarding male's chances at a successful insemination by brawling with the guarding male to gain access to the female. In Drosophila, males release seminal fluids that contain additional toxins like pheromones and modified enzymes that are secreted by their accessory glands intended to destroy the sperm that have already made their way into the female's reproductive tract from a recent copulation. Based on the \\"last male precedence\\" idea, some males can remove sperm from previous males by ejaculating new sperm into the female; hindering successful insemination opportunities of the previous male. ==Mate choice== The \\"good sperm hypothesis\\" is very common in polyandrous mating systems. The \\"good sperm hypothesis\\" suggests that a male's genetic makeup will determine the level of his competitiveness in sperm competition. When a male has \\"good sperm\\" he is able to father more viable offspring than males that do not have the \\"good sperm\\" genes. Females may select males that have these superior \\"good sperm\\" genes because it means that their offspring will be more viable and will inherit the \\"good sperm\\" genes which will increase their fitness levels when their sperm competes. Studies show that there is more to determining the competitiveness of the sperm in sperm competition in addition to a male's genetic makeup. A male's dietary intake will also affect sperm competition. An adequate diet consisting of increased amounts of diet and sometimes more specific ratio in certain species will optimize sperm number and fertility. Amounts of protein and carbohydrate intake were tested for its effects on sperm production and quality in adult fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae). Studies showed these flies need to constantly ingest carbohydrates and water to survive, but protein is also required to attain sexual maturity.Hendrichs, J., Cooley, S. S., and Prokopy, R. J.

In addition, The Mediterranean fruit fly, male diet has been shown to affect male mating success, copula duration, sperm transfer, and male participation in leks. These all require a good diet with nutrients for proper gamete production as well as energy for activities, which includes participation in leks. In addition, protein and carbohydrate amounts were shown to have an effect on sperm production and fertility in the speckled cockroach. Holidic diets were used which allowed for specific protein and carbohydrate measurements to be taken, giving it credibility. A direct correlation was seen in sperm number and overall of food intake. More specifically, optimal sperm production was measured at a 1:2 protein to carbohydrate ratio. Sperm fertility was best at a similar protein to carbohydrate ratio of 1:2. This close alignment largely factors in determining male fertility in Nauphoeta cinerea. Surprisingly, sperm viability was not affected by any change in diet or diet ratios. It's hypothesized that sperm viability is more affected by the genetic makeup, like in the \\"good sperm hypothesis\\". These ratios and results are not consistent with many other species and even conflict with some. It seems there can't be any conclusions on what type of diet is needed to positively influence sperm competition but rather understand that different diets do play a role in determining sperm competition in mate choice. ==Evolutionary consequences== One evolutionary response to sperm competition is the variety in penis morphology of many species.Parker, G. A. \\"Sperm competition and the evolution of animal mating strategies.\\" Sperm competition and the evolution of animal mating systems (1984): 1-60. For example, the shape of the human penis may have been selectively shaped by sperm competition. The human penis may have been selected to displace seminal fluids implanted in the female reproductive tract by a rival male. Specifically, the shape of the coronal ridge may promote displacement of seminal fluid from a previous mating via thrusting action during sexual intercourse. A 2003 study by Gordon G. Gallup and colleagues concluded that one evolutionary purpose of the thrusting motion characteristic of intense intercourse is for the penis to ‚Äúupsuck‚Äù another man's semen before depositing its own. Evolution to increase ejaculate volume in the presence of sperm competition has a consequence on testis size. Large testes can produce more sperm required for larger ejaculates, and can be found across the animal kingdom when sperm competition occurs. Males with larger testes have been documented to achieve higher reproductive success rates than males with smaller testes in male yellow pine chipmunks. In chichlid fish, it has been found that increased sperm competition can lead to evolved larger sperm numbers, sperm cell sizes, and sperm swimming speeds. In some insects and spiders, for instance Nephila fenestrate, the male copulatory organ breaks off or tears off at the end of copulation and remains within the female to serve as a copulatory plug. This broken genitalia is believed to be an evolutionary response to sperm competition. This damage to the male genitalia means that these males can only mate once. ==Female choice for males with competitive sperm== Female factors can influence the result of sperm competition through a process known as \\"sperm choice\\". Proteins present in the female reproductive tract or on the surface of the ovum may influence which sperm succeeds in fertilizing the egg. During sperm choice females are able to discriminate and differentially use the sperm from different males. One instance where this is known to occur is inbreeding; females will preferentially use the sperm from a more distantly related male than a close relative. ===Post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance=== Inbreeding ordinarily has negative fitness consequences (inbreeding depression), and as a result species have evolved mechanisms to avoid inbreeding. Inbreeding depression is considered to be due largely to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutations. Outcrossing between unrelated individuals ordinarily leads to the masking of deleterious recessive mutations in progeny. Numerous inbreeding avoidance mechanisms operating prior to mating have been described. However, inbreeding avoidance mechanisms that operate subsequent to copulation are less well known. In guppies, a post-copulatory mechanism of inbreeding avoidance occurs based on competition between sperm of rival males for achieving fertilization. In competitions between sperm from an unrelated male and from a full sibling male, a significant bias in paternity towards the unrelated male was observed. In vitro fertilization experiments in the mouse, provided evidence of sperm selection at the gametic level. When sperm of sibling and non-sibling males were mixed, a fertilization bias towards the sperm of the non-sibling males was observed. The results were interpreted as egg-driven sperm selection against related sperm. Female fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) were mated with males of four different degrees of genetic relatedness in competition experiments. Sperm competitive ability was negatively correlated with relatedness. Female crickets (Teleogryllus oceanicus) appear to use post-copulatory mechanisms to avoid producing inbred offspring. When mated to both a sibling and an unrelated male, females bias paternity towards the unrelated male. ==Empirical support== Scanning electron microscopic image of immature parasperm lancet (infertile sperm morph) of Fusitriton oregonensis showing the tail brush still present, which later develops into part of the body of the parasperm. It is produced when sperm competition occurs. It has been found that because of female choice (see sexual selection), morphology of sperm in many species occurs in many variations to accommodate or combat (see sexual conflict) the morphology and physiology of the female reproductive tract. However, it is difficult to understand the interplay between female and male reproductive shape and structure that occurs within the female reproductive tract after mating that allows for the competition of sperm. Polyandrous females mate with many male partners. Females of many species of arthropod, mollusk and other phyla have a specialized sperm-storage organ called the spermatheca in which the sperm of different males sometimes compete for increased reproductive success. Species of crickets, specifically Gryllus bimaculatus, are known to exhibit polyandrous sexual selection. Males will invest more in ejaculation when competitors are in the immediate environment of the female. Evidence exists that illustrates the ability of genetically similar spermatozoa to cooperate so as to ensure the survival of their counterparts thereby ensuring the implementation of their genotypes towards fertilization. Cooperation confers a competitive advantage by several means, some of these include incapacitation of other competing sperm and aggregation of genetically similar spermatozoa into structures that promote effective navigation of the female reproductive tract and hence improve fertilization ability. Such characteristics lead to morphological adaptations that suit the purposes of cooperative methods during competition. For example, spermatozoa possessed by the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) possess an apical hook which is used to attach to other spermatozoa to form mobile trains that enhance motility through the female reproductive tract. Spermatozoa that fail to incorporate themselves into mobile trains are less likely to engage in fertilization. Other evidence suggests no link between sperm competition and sperm hook morphology. Selection to produce more sperm can also select for the evolution of larger testes. Relationships across species between the frequency of multiple mating by females and male testis size are well documented across many groups of animals. For example, among primates, female gorillas are relatively monogamous, so gorillas have smaller testes than humans, which in turn have smaller testes than the highly promiscuous bonobos.Harcourt, A.H., Harvey, P.H., Larson, S.G., & Short, R.V. 1981. Testis weight, body weight and breeding system in primates, Nature 293: 55-57 Male chimpanzees that live in a structured multi-male, multi-female community, have large testicles to produce more sperm, therefore giving him better odds to fertilize the female. Whereas the community of gorillas consist of one alpha male and two or three females, when the female gorillas are ready to mate, normally only the alpha male is their partner. Regarding sexual dimorphism among primates, humans falls into an intermediate group with moderate sex differences in body size but relatively large testes. This is a typical pattern of primates where several males and females live together in a group and the male faces an intermediate number of challenges from other males compared to exclusive polygyny and monogamy but frequent sperm competition. Other means of sperm competition could include improving the sperm itself or its packaging materials (spermatophore). The male black-winged damselfly provides a striking example of an adaptation to sperm competition. Female black-winged damselflies are known to mate with several males over the span of only a few hours and therefore possess a receptacle known as a spermatheca which stores the sperm. During the process of mating the male damselfly will pump his abdomen up and down using his specially adapted penis which acts as a scrub brush to remove the sperm of another male. This method proves quite successful and the male damselfly has been known to remove 90-100 percent of the competing sperm.Alcock 1998 Male dunnocks (Prunella modularis) peck at the female's cloaca, removing sperm of previous mates. A similar strategy has been observed in the dunnock, a small bird. Before mating with the polyandrous female, the male dunnock pecks at the female's cloaca in order to peck out the sperm of the previous male suitor. In the fly Dryomyza anilis, females mate with multiple males. It benefits the male to attempt to be the last one to mate with a given female. This is because there seems to be a cumulative percentage increase in fertilization for the final male, such that the eggs laid in the last oviposition bout are the most successful. A notion emerged in 1996 that in some species, including humans, a significant fraction of sperm specialize in a manner such that they cannot fertilize the egg but instead have the primary effect of stopping the sperm from other males from reaching the egg, e.g. by killing them with enzymes or by blocking their access. This type of sperm specialization became known popularly as \\"kamikaze sperm\\" or \\"killer sperm\\", but most follow-up studies to this popularized notion have failed to confirm the initial papers on the matter.Baker 1996 While there is also currently little evidence of killer sperm in any non-human animals certain snails have an infertile sperm morph (\\"parasperm\\") that contains lysozymes, leading to speculation that they might be able to degrade a rivals' sperm. Sperm competition has led to other adaptations such as larger ejaculates, prolonged copulation, deposition of a copulatory plug to prevent the female re-mating, or the application of pheromones that reduce the female's attractiveness. The adaptation of sperm traits, such as length, viability and velocity might be constrained by the influence of cytoplasmic DNA (e.g. mitochondrial DNA); mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the mother only and it is thought that this could represent a constraint in the evolution of sperm. == See also == * Concealed ovulation * Strategic pluralism * Sociobiological theories of rape * Polygamy in house mouse * Human sperm competition * Sperm competition in mammals == References == ==Further reading== * Alcock, John 1998.

It is a regional variation of the wheat beer style from Northern Germany, dating back to at least the 16th century. It can be made from combinations of malted barley and wheat, with the stipulation that the malts are kilned at very low temperatures to minimise colour formation. The fermentation takes place with a mixture of yeast and lactic acid bacteria, a prerequisite that creates the lactic acid taste, a distinguishing feature of Berliner Weisse.Annem√ºller, Gerolf. Die Berliner Weisse: ein St√ºck Berliner Geschichte. VLB Berlin, 2008. By the late 19th century, Berliner Weisse was the most popular alcoholic drink in Berlin, with up to fifty breweries producing it. By the late 20th century, there were only two breweries left in Berlin producing the beer. ==History== Berliner Weisse from different breweries Most beer authorities trace the origins of Berliner Weisse to an unknown beer being produced in Hamburg which was copied and developed by the 16th century brewer Cord Broihan.The world guide to beer, Michael Jackson, Mitchell Beazley, 1977, page 56 - \\"Berliner Weisse\\", Broihan's beer, Halberst√§dter Broihan, became very popular, and a version was being brewed in Berlin by the Berlin doctor J.S. Elsholz in the 1640s. An alternative possibility, given by Protz among others, is that migrating Huguenots developed the beer from the local red and brown ales as they moved through Flanders into Northern Germany.'Classic Bottled beers of the World, Roger Protz, Prion Books, 1997, \\"Berlin Wheat beer\\" - pages 81 and 82, Some sources, such as Dornbusch, give the date 1572 as being the earliest record of the beer being brewed in Berlin. Prost! The Story of German Beer, Horst D. Dornbusch, Brewers publications, 1997, \\"Berliner Wheat, a Spritzy, Sour Summer Refresher\\" - pages 112 - 113, Frederick Wilhelm encouraged the spread of the beer through Prussia, declaring it as \\"best for our climate\\", and having his son, Frederick the Great, trained to brew it. A popular story is that Napoleon's troops dubbed it \\"The Champagne of the North\\" in 1809. A typical modern strength for Berliner Weisse is around 3% abv, though strength may have varied at times. Traditionally, beers brewed in March (M√§rzen beers) were brewed stronger and allowed to mature over the summer months, and there is a report that this may have also happened with Berliner Weisse ‚Äî the bottles being buried in sand or warm earth.\\"Die Herstellung oberg√§hriger Biere\\", by Franz Sch√∂nfeld, 1902, page 88. ==Brewing== Modern brewing methods use a low proportion of wheat, generally ranging from 25% to 50%, and deliberately create a sourness either by a secondary fermentation in the bottle (Jackson suggests that traditionally bottles were buried in warm earth for several months), or by adding Lactobacillus. Records from the early 19th century indicate that the beer was brewed from five parts wheat to one part barley, and drunk young, with little indication of creating sourness with either a secondary fermentation or by adding Lactobacillus. ==Brands== At the height of Berliner Weisse production in the 19th century, it was the most popular alcoholic drink in Berlin, and 700 breweries produced it. By the end of the 20th century there were only two breweries left in Berlin, and a handful in the rest of Germany. The two Berlin breweries, Berliner Kindl and Schultheiss, are both now owned by the Oetker Group and one of the few brands still produced in Berlin is Berliner Kindl Weisse. ==Serving== A glass of Berliner Weisse flavoured with raspberry syrup Berliner Weisse is often served in a bowl-shaped glass with flavoured syrups,The World Guide to Beer, Michael Jackson, Mitchell Beazley, such as raspberry (Himbeersirup), or artificial woodruff flavouring (Waldmeistersirup). The beer may also be mixed with other drinks, such as pale lager, in order to balance the sourness. ==ReferencesBibliography=== *The World Guide to Beer, Michael Jackson, Mitchell Beazley, 1977, page 56 - \\"Berlner Weisse\\", * Die Biere Deutschlands, 1988, by Dietrich H√∂llhuber and Wolfgang Kaul, page 340, ==External links== *Berliner Weisse germanbeerinstitute.com Category:German beer styles Category:Beer brands of Germany Category:North German cuisine Category:Berlin cuisine ","title":"Berliner Weisse"},{"id":"822249","text":"A Higher National Diploma (HND) is an academic higher education qualification in the United Kingdom and various other countries. They were first introduced in England and Wales in 1920 alongside the Ordinary National Diploma and the Higher National Certificate. A qualification of the same title is also offered in Argentina, Brunei, India, Malta, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and some other countries with British ties. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Higher Nationals may either be awarded by British degree-awarding bodies under approved licence from Pearson (which allows the Universities to devise, deliver and award Higher National qualifications themselves), or they may be awarded directly by Pearson, as an awarding body regulated by Ofqual. This qualification can be used to gain entry to over 95% of UK Universities including the University of Oxford at an advanced level (admission to either Year 2 or Year 3 of a bachelor degree); HND is equivalent to a foundation degree or the first two years of a bachelor degree. Higher National Diploma can be split into two parts, with students within their first year of study pursuing a Higher National Certificate (HNC is a separate qualification and is not required for a Higher National Diploma award, although it still encompasses the first year content). In the second year of study, students pursue the HND which is generally more extensive and academically rigorous than HNC. Higher National Diplomas are graded, usually based on a weighted average (with higher weight given to marks in the final year of the course, and often zero weight to those in the first year) of the marks gained in exams and other assessments. Grade boundaries may vary by institution, but usually follow the boundaries given below: * Distinction ‚Äì typically 70% and higher * Merit ‚Äì typically 60-69% * Pass ‚Äì typically 40-59%. ==Overview== In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the HND is a qualification awarded by many awarding bodies, such as the Confederation of Tourism and Hospitality (CTH Advanced diploma), Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and BTEC (Vocational programs). In Scotland, a Higher National is awarded by the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA). The attainment level is roughly equivalent to the second year of a 3-year English degree or to a Diploma of Higher Education. An HND takes two years of full-time study, or one year full- time following successful completion of a Higher National Certificate; part- time study takes longer.choosing your qualification : Aimhigher Unsuccessful completion of the Higher National Diploma can lead to the student being compensatory awarded a Higher National Certificate if the student does not gain enough credits to pass the Higher National Diploma in the final year of their studies. In Ghana, HND is offered in Polytechnics with Programmes of Secretaryship and Management Studies also equivalents to associate degree in Business Administration, Accounting, marketing, etc. In Nigeria, HND is a continuation of a National Diploma (ND-[equivalent to associate degree]) programme, both offered by polytechnics. The ND and HND programmes have a duration of two years each with one-year break after the ND programme for an Industrial Training (IT) attachment in relevant industries. At the completion of an HND programme, the graduate would have spent 4 to 5 years; hence, Higher National Diplomas are sometimes referred to \\"equivalent\\" of a first degree. Although, there have existed a long-standing disagreement over the \\"equivalence\\" of HND to university first degree; employers of labour (including the government and its policies) have discriminated against HND holders‚Äîgrading them below their university counterparts and preventing them from attaining managerial or directorate cadres. However, following series of effortshttp://nigerianuniversityscholarships.com/polytechnic-students-staff- plead-with-buhari-to-end-hnd-b-sc-disparity/ by polytechnic students/lecturers and concerned entities, the federal government has made attempts to remove the dichotomy between HND and degree holders in places of employment, and the efforts are paying off as some of the government organisations (especially paramilitary) have started upgrading and employing the HND-holders at par with their First Degree counterparts. Some have even claimed that the HND graduates are better than their universities counterparts in the same fields. In Scotland an HND is Level 8 on the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework and in England, Wales and Northern Ireland it is Level 5 on the Regulated Qualifications Framework/Credit and Qualifications Framework for Wales.The Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework It is quite common for those who have achieved an HND to add to their qualification by progressing to other levels such as professional qualifications, a degree or a \\"Top-Up\\" degree.

An S bridge is a bridge whose alignment follows a reverse curve, shaped roughly like a shallow letter S in plan, used in early 19th-century road construction in the United States. They were generally used for crossing small, curving streams with uneven banks. Several of these bridges are found in and around the New Concord, Ohio area. S bridges were originally constructed early in the 19th century. The design was adopted where the road crossed the creek or river at an angle. Constructing a bridge at an angle was much more complicated and expensive than building the bridge perpendicular to the water flow and banks. The bridges were constructed at 90 degrees to the bank, while two 'aprons' were constructed at opposite angles to direct the traffic flow smoothly onto the bridge, thus creating the 's' shape. Only a few of these bridges still exist, mostly in Ohio. Four of them are located in Guernsey County. Fox Run S bridge is located along U.S. Route 40 in New Concord in Muskingum County. The next bridge, four and a half miles east from New Concord on U.S. Route 40, is found at the intersection of US 40 and Peter's Creek Road. Continuing eastward, the next bridge may be found a short distance from US 40 on Manilla Road. The next \\"S\\" bridge is east of Cambridge along US 40 at its intersection with Old National Road and has fallen into considerable disrepair. The fourth bridge is located between Old Washington, Ohio and Middlebourne, Ohio along Blend Road, at the intersection of Bridgewater Road, and has been designated a National Historic Landmark.

The Board of Directors (BoD) was the ruling body.Board of Directors Members around the time of the merge were: * ARM Holdings * Cadence Design Systems * Freescale Semiconductor * LSI Corporation * Mentor Graphics * NXP Semiconductors * STMicroelectronics * Synopsys * Texas Instruments Contributing members performed the standardization work and donate time and effort to the production of new specifications.Contributing Members Reviewing member status was a free membership for companies. These get early access to specifications to facilitate a deep review round of each proposal before it goes public.Associate Members Associate member status was similar to a reviewing membership but for academics and other not-for-profit organizations.Reviewing Members ===Open Core Protocol International Partnership Association=== The Open Core Protocol International Partnership Association, Inc. (OCP-IP) was an independent, non-profit semiconductor industry consortium formed to administer the support, promotion and enhancement of the Open Core Protocol (OCP). OCP was the first fully supported, openly licensed, comprehensive, interface socket for semiconductor intellectual property (IP) cores. The mission of OCP-IP was to address problems relating to design, verification, and testing which are common to IP core reuse in \\"plug and play\\" system on a chip (SoC) products. This initiative comprehensively fulfills system-level integration requirements by promoting IP core reusability and reducing design time, risk and manufacturing costs for SoC designs. Design teams developing consumer, data processing, telecom (wireless or wired), datacom and mass storage applications can gain significant benefits from the OCP-IP solution. ==Accellera membership== Corporate members have a right to be eligible for election to the Board of Directors.

In modern plumbing, a drain- waste-vent (or DWV) is part of a system that allows air to enter a plumbing system to maintain proper air pressure to enable the removal of sewage and greywater from a dwelling. Waste is produced at fixtures such as toilets, sinks, and showers. As the water runs down, proper venting is required to avoid a vacuum from being created. As the water runs down air must be allowed into the waste pipe either through a roof vent, or the \\"drain waste vent.\\" (or DWV) == Overview == DWV systems maintain neutral air pressure in the drains, allowing free flow of water and sewage down drains and through waste pipes by gravity. It is critical that a sufficient downward slope be maintained throughout, to keep liquids and entrained solids flowing freely towards the main drain from the building. In some situations, a downward slope out of a building to the sewer cannot be created, and a special collection pit and grinding lift \\"sewage ejector\\" pump are needed. By contrast, potable water supply systems operate under pressure to distribute water up through buildings, and do not require a continuous downward slope in their piping. Every fixture is required to have an internal or external trap; double trapping is prohibited by plumbing codes due to its susceptibility to clogging. Every plumbing fixture must also have an attached vent. The top of stacks must be vented too, via a stack vent, which is sometimes called a stink pipe. All plumbing waste fixtures use traps to prevent sewer gases from leaking into the house. Through traps, all fixtures are connected to waste lines, which in turn take the waste to a \\"soil stack\\", or \\"soil vent pipe\\". At the building drain system's lowest point, the drain-waste vent is attached, and rises (usually inside a wall) to and out of the roof. Waste exits from the building through the building's main drain and flows through a sewage line, which leads to a septic system or a public sewer. Cesspits are generally prohibited in developed areas. The venting system, or plumbing vents, consists of a number of pipes leading from waste pipes to the outdoors, usually through the roof. Vents provide a means to release sewer gases outside instead of inside the house. Vents also admit oxygen to the waste system to allow aerobic sewage digestion, and to discourage noxious anaerobic decomposition. Vents provide a way to equalize the pressure on both sides of a trap, thereby allowing the trap to hold the water which is needed to maintain effectiveness of the trap, and avoiding \\"trap suckout\\" which otherwise might occur. == Operation == A sewer pipe is normally at neutral air pressure compared to the surrounding atmosphere. When a column of waste water flows through a pipe, it compresses air ahead of it in the pipe, creating a positive pressure that must be released so it does not push back on the waste stream and downstream trap water seals. As the column of water passes, air must freely flow in behind the waste stream, or negative pressure results. The extent of these pressure fluctuations is determined by the fluid volume of the waste discharge. Excessive negative air pressure, behind a \\"slug\\" of water that is draining, can siphon water from traps at plumbing fixtures. Generally, a toilet outlet has the shortest trap seal, making it most vulnerable to being emptied by induced siphonage. An empty trap can allow noxious sewer gases to enter a building. On the other hand, if the air pressure within the drain becomes suddenly higher than ambient, this positive transient could cause waste water to be pushed into the fixture, breaking the trap seal, with serious hygiene and health consequences if too forceful. Tall buildings of three or more stories are particularly susceptible to this problem. Vent stacks are installed in parallel to waste stacks to allow proper venting in tall buildings. == External venting == Most residential building drainage systems in North America are vented directly through the building roofs. The DWV pipe is typically ABS or PVC DWV-rated plastic pipe equipped with a flashing at the roof penetration to prevent rainwater from entering the buildings. Older homes may use copper, iron, lead or clay pipes, in rough order of increasing antiquity. Under many older building codes, a vent stack (a pipe leading to the main roof vent) is required to be within a radius of the draining fixture it serves (sink, toilet, shower stall, etc.). To allow only one vent stack, and thus one roof penetration as permitted by local building code, sub-vents may be tied together inside the building and exit via a common vent stack. One additional requirement for a vent stack connection occurs when there are very long horizontal drain runs with very little slope to the run. Adding a vent connection within the run will aid flow, and when used with a cleanout allows for better serviceability of the long run. A blocked vent is a relatively common problem caused by anything from leaves, to dead animals, to ice dams in very cold weather, or a horizontal section of the venting system, sloped the wrong way and filled with water from rain or condensation. Symptoms range from bubbles in the toilet bowl when it is flushed, to slow drainage, and all the way to siphoned (empty) traps which allow sewer gases to enter the building. When a fixture trap is venting properly, a \\"sucking\\" sound can often be heard as the fixture vigorously empties out during normal operation. This phenomenon is harmless, and is different from \\"trap suckout\\" induced by pressure variations caused by wastewater movement elsewhere in the system, which is not supposed to allow interactions from one fixture to another. Toilets are a special case, since they are usually designed to self-siphon to ensure complete evacuation of their contents; they are then automatically refilled by a special valve mechanism. == Internal venting == Mechanical vents (also called cheater vents) come in two types: Air admittance valves and check vents, the latter being a vent with a check valve. Air admittance valves (AAVs, or commonly referred to in the UK as Durgo valves and in the US as Studor vents and Sure-Vent¬Æ) are negative-pressure-activated, one-way mechanical valves, used in a plumbing or drainage venting system to eliminate the need for conventional pipe venting and roof penetrations. A discharge of wastewater causes the AAV to open, releasing the vacuum and allowing air to enter the plumbing vent pipe for proper pressure equalization. Since AAVs will only operate under negative pressure situations, they are not suitable for all venting applications, such as venting a sump, where positive pressures are created when the sump fills. Also, where positive drainage pressures are found in larger buildings or multi-story buildings, an air admittance valve could be used in conjunction with a positive pressure reduction device such as the PAPA positive air pressure attenuator to provide a complete venting solution for more complicated drainage venting systems. Using AAVs can significantly reduce the amount of venting materials needed in a plumbing system, increase plumbing labor efficiency, allow greater flexibility in the layout of plumbing fixtures, and reduce long-term roof maintenance problems associated with conventional vent stack roofing penetrations. While some state and local building departments prohibit AAVs, the International Residential and International Plumbing Codes allow it to be used in place of a vent through the roof. AAVs are certified to reliably open and close a minimum of 500,000 times, (approximately 30 years of use) with no release of sewer gas; some manufacturers claim their units are tested for up to 1.5 million cycles, or at least 80 years of use. AAVs have been effectively used in Europe for more than two decades. ==Island fixture vent== Island fixture vent for under-cabinet waste plumbing An island fixture vent, sometimes colloquially called a \\"Chicago Loop\\", ‚ÄúBoston loop‚Äù or \\"Bow Vent\\", is an alternate way of venting the trap installed on an under counter island sink or other similar applications where a conventional vertical vent stack or air admittance valve is not feasible or allowed. As with all drains, ventilation must be provided to allow the flowing waste water to displace the sewer gas in the drain, and then to allow air (or some other fluid) to fill the vacuum which would otherwise form as the water flows down the pipe. An island fixture vent provides an elegant solution for this necessity: when the drain is opened, water displaces the sewer gas up to the sanitary tee, the water flows downward while sewer gas is displaced upward and toward the vent. The vent can also provide air to fill any vacuum created. The key to a functional island fixture vent is that the top elbow must be at least as high as the \\"flood level\\" (the peak possible drain water level in the sink). This ensures that the vent never becomes waterlogged. ===Cost=== The cost of installation is high because of the number of elbows and small pieces of pipe required. The largest cost outlay with modern plastic drain pipes is labor. Use of street elbows is helpful. Alternately if moving sink to an island sink, install the P-trap below the floor of the island and vent off the top of the drain. Attach toward the trap and reverse 180 degrees so any water in the vent flows down the drain. Slope drain down, slope vent up, and attach to existing vent from previous existing fixture that is now abandoned. Patch previously existing drain to become vent. In Canada, the national plumbing code requires that the minimum trap arm be at least 2 times the pipe diameter, (e.g., 1.25 inch pipe needs a 2.5-inch trap arm, 1.5 pipe needs a 3-inch trap arm, etc.) and that the vent pipe be one size larger than the drain that it serves, also a cleanout is required on both the vent and the drain. The reason for this is in the event of a plugged sink, the waste water will back up and go down the vent, possibly plugging the vent (as it is under the countertop), and a clean- out would permit the cleaning of the pipes. == Fittings == Drainage and venting systems require not only pipe, but also many specialized fittings which add considerably to their cost of construction. Special access fittings such as \\"clean-outs\\" enhance the long-term maintainability of the systems, and are required by most plumbing codes. == See also == * Fuel gas piping * Plumber * Potable cold and hot water supply * Rainwater, surface, and subsurface water drainage == References == == Further reading == * == External links == Category:Plumbing Category:Building engineering ","title":"Drain-waste-vent system"},{"id":"822304","text":"Johannes Scotus or Skotus, John Scotus, or John the Scot may refer to: * Johannes Scotus Eriugena, Irish theologian, philosopher, and poet (c. 815‚Äì877) * John Scotus (bishop of Mecklenburg) (c. 990‚Äì1066) * John Scotus (bishop of Dunkeld), Bishop of St Andrews and Dunkeld (d. 1203) * John of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon (c. 1207‚Äì1237) * Duns Scotus, philosopher and theologian (c. 1266‚Äì1308) ","title":"John Scotus"},{"id":"822310","text":"Single-issue politics involves political campaigning or political support based on one essential policy area or idea. ==Political expression== One weakness of such an approach is that effective political parties are usually coalitions of factions or advocacy groups. Bringing together political forces based on a single intellectual or cultural common denominator can be unrealistic; though there may be considerable public opinion on one side of an argument, it does not necessarily follow that mobilizing under that one banner will bring results. A defining issue may indeed come to dominate one particular electoral campaign, sufficiently to swing the result. Imposing such an issue may well be what single-issue politics concern; but for the most part success is rather limited, and electorates choose governments for reasons with a broader base. Single-issue politics may express itself through the formation of a single-issue party, an approach that tends to be more successful in parliamentary systems based on proportional representation than in rigid two- party systems (like that of the United States). Alternatively, it may proceed through political advocacy groups of various kinds, including Lobby groups, pressure groups and other forms of political expression external to normal representative government. Within a broad-based party it may be the concern of a single-issue caucus. Very visible as it was in Western democracies in the second half of the twentieth century, single-issue politics is hardly a new phenomenon. In the 1880s, the third government of William Ewart Gladstone made British politics in practical terms single-issue, around the Home Rule Bill, leading to a split of the Liberal Party. ==Groups and voters== Single-issue politics are a form of litmus test; common examples are abortion, taxation, animal rights, environment, and guns. The National Rifle Association in the United States, which has only one specific interest, is an example of a single-issue group. What differentiates single-issue groups from other interest groups is their intense style of lobbying. The term single-issue voter has been used to describe people who may make voting decisions based on the candidates' stance on a single issue (e.g. \\"pro-life\\" or \\"pro-choice\\", support for gun rights or gun control). The existence of single-issue voters can give a distorted impression: a candidate's overall views may not enjoy the same support. For example, a person who votes for a socially liberal Republican candidate, based solely on his or her support of abortion, may not necessarily share the candidate's other views on social issues, such as gun rights or family values. ==Single-issue parties== A single-issue party is a political party that campaigns on only one issue. It is generally believed that single-issue parties are favoured by voluntary voting systems, as they tend to attract very committed supporters who will always vote. Through systems like instant runoff voting and proportional representation they can have substantial influence on the results of elections. First-past-the-post voting systems tend to nullify their influence, but local single-issue parties, such as Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern, which sought to reopen the Accident and Emergency unit at Kidderminster Hospital, may see more success under this voting system. This party won the Wyre Forest seat, where the hospital is located, at two consecutive general elections (in 2001 and 2005) in the United Kingdom. In instant-runoff electoral systems which allow unsuccessful parties to designate where their votes are redistributed, single-issue parties may be formed as a way to funnel more votes to another candidate with quite different policies. For instance, in the 1999 New South Wales state election, candidate Malcolm Jones received just 0.2% of the primary vote, but achieved the quota of 4.5% required to win a Legislative Council seat after receiving preferences from a wide range of minor parties (including both the 'Gun Owners and Sporting Hunters Rights Party' and the 'Animal Liberation Party'); MLC Lee Rhiannon accused many of these parties of being nothing more than fronts. A similar type of political party have been numerous in the Netherlands, where they are called testimonial parties. Testimonial parties are often concentrated around a specific set of principles or policies which they seek to promote without the compromises contingent on ordinary coalition politics. Examples of some successful testimonial parties are the Party for the Animals, the Reformed Political Party, or the former Pacifist Socialist Party. In Australia, a number of single issue parties have been elected to federal and state parliaments such as the Animal Justice Party, Dignity for Disability, Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party and the Australian Sex Party. Other single-issue parties focus on the interests of a specific target group, such as ethnic minorities, retirees and students. Cannabis political parties and pirate parties which exist in a number of countries, are explicitly based around the single issues of cannabis legalization and copyright liberalisation respectively. These parties often evolve to adopt a full platform, however. ==See also== *Big tent *Identity politics *Issue voting *Protest vote *Voting bloc ==References== ","title":"Single-issue politics"},{"id":"822311","text":"In ancient Rome, the Parentalia () or dies parentales (, \\"ancestral days\\") was a nine-day festival held in honor of family ancestors, beginning on 13 February.Mary Beard, J.A. North, and S.R.F. Price, Religions of Rome: A History (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 50; Stefan Weinstock, Divus Julius (Oxford, 1971), pp. 291-6. Although the Parentalia was a holiday on the Roman religious calendar, its observances were mainly domestic and familial.Beard et al., Religions of Rome, p. 50. The importance of the family to the Roman state, however, was expressed by public ceremonies on the opening day, the Ides of February, when a Vestal conducted a rite for the collective di parentes of Rome at the tomb of Tarpeia.William Warde Fowler, The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic (London, 1908), p. 306 (1899 Internet Archive edition available. ==Overview== Ovid describes sacred offerings (sacrificia) of flower-garlands, wheat, salt, wine-soaked bread and violets to the \\"shades of the dead\\" (Manes or Di manes) at family tombs, which were located outside Rome's sacred boundary (pomerium). These observances were meant to strengthen the mutual obligations and protective ties between the living and the dead, and were a lawful duty of the paterfamilias (head of the family).Ovid, Fasti, 2.537-539. Ibid 2.534 for manes; W. Warde Fowler, The Roman festivals of the period of the Republic, p. 306, cites Festus' di manes as a placatory euphemism: some Manes were to be feared. Parentalia concluded on 21 February in the midnight rites of Feralia, when the paterfamilias addressed the malevolent, destructive aspects of his Manes. Feralia was a placation and exorcism: Ovid thought it a more rustic, primitive and ancient affair than the Parentalia itself. It appears to have functioned as a cleansing ritual for Caristia on the following day, when the family held an informal banquet to celebrate the amity between themselves and their benevolent ancestral dead (Lares).Ovid, Fasti, 2.677. Fowler, Roman Festivals, p. 309, has ritualistically clothed statues of the Lares at this \\"sacred meal.\\" The emphasis on collective cult for the Manes and early di parentes implies their afterlife as vague and lacking individuation. In later cult they are vested with personal qualities, and in Imperial cult, they acquire divine numen and become divi, divine entities.Duncan Fishwick, The Imperial Cult in the Latin West: Studies in the Ruler Cult of the Western Provinces of the Roman Empire, vol 1, 1991, 1, 51.

A noble of the Chu state, Xiang Yu rebelled against the Qin dynasty and became a prominent warlord. He was granted the title of \\"Duke of Lu\\" (È≠ØÂÖ¨) by King Huai II of the restoring Chu state in 208 BC. The following year, he led the Chu forces to victory at the Battle of Julu against the Qin armies led by Zhang Han. After the fall of Qin, Xiang Yu was enthroned as the \\"Hegemon-King of Western Chu\\" (Ë•øÊ•öÈú∏Áéã) and ruled a vast area covering modern-day central and eastern China, with Pengcheng as his capital. He engaged Liu Bang, the founding emperor of the Han dynasty, in a long struggle for power, known as the Chu‚ÄìHan Contention, which concluded with his eventual defeat at the Battle of Gaixia. He committed suicide at the bank of the Wu River. ==Names and titles== Xiang Yu's family name was Xiang () while his given name was Ji () and his courtesy name was Yu (). He is best known as Xiang Yu. Xiang Yu is popularly known as \\"Xi Chu Ba Wang\\" (), which has been translated as \\"Overlord of Western Chu\\", \\"Hegemon-King of Western Chu\\", \\"Conqueror of Western Chu\\", \\"King of Kings of Western Chu\\", and other renditions. This title is sometimes simplified to \\"Ba Wang\\" (), without the link to \\"Western Chu\\". Since Xiang Yu's death, the term Ba Wang has come to be used specifically to refer to him. Xiang Yu's subjects sometimes address him as \\"Xiang Wang\\" (), which literally means \\"King Xiang\\". ==Family background== There are two accounts of Xiang Yu's family background. The first claimed that Xiang Yu was from the house of Mi (Áæã), the royal family of the Chu state in the Zhou dynasty. His ancestors were granted the land of Xiang (È†Ö) by the king of Chu and had since adopted \\"Xiang\\" as their family name. The other account claimed that Xiang Yu was a descendant of a noble clan from the Lu state and his family had served in the Chu military for generations. Xiang Yu's grandfather was a well known general who led the Chu army in resisting the Qin invaders led by Wang Jian, and was killed in action when Qin conquered Chu in 223 BC. Xiang Yu was born in 232 BC in the late Warring States period when the Qin state started unifying the other six major states. According to the descendants of the Xiang family in Suqian, Xiang Yu's father was Xiang Chao (È†ÖË∂Ö), Xiang Yan's eldest son. Xiang Yu was raised by his elder uncle Xiang Liang because his father died early. In 221 BC, when Xiang Yu was about 11 years old, the Qin state unified China and established the Qin dynasty. Xiang Yu had a double pupil in one of his eyesSima Qian. Records of the Grand Historian, Volume 7, Annals of Xiang Yu. just like the mythical Emperor Shun and Duke Wen of Jin. He was thus seen as an extraordinary person because his unique double pupil was a mark of a king or sage in Chinese tradition. Xiang Yu was slightly taller than eight chi (approximately 1.85 metres, about 6' 1\\") and possessed unusual physical strength as he could lift a ding (an ancient Chinese vessel resembling a giant cauldron on tripods). ==Early life== In his younger days, Xiang Yu was instructed in scholarly arts and swordsmanship but he did not manage to master what he was taught, and his uncle Xiang Liang was not very satisfied with him. Xiang Yu said, \\"Books are only useful in helping me remember my name. Mastering swordsmanship allows me to face only one opponent, so it's not worth learning. I want to learn how to defeat thousands of enemies.\\" Hence, his uncle tried to educate him in military strategy and the art of war instead, but Xiang Yu stopped learning after he had grasped the main ideas; Xiang Liang was disappointed with his nephew, who showed no sign of motivation or apparent talent apart from his great strength, so he gave up and let Xiang Yu decide his own future. When Xiang Yu grew older, Xiang Liang killed someone so they fled to Wu to evade the authorities. At the time, Qin Shi Huang was on an inspection tour in that area and Xiang Yu and his uncle watched the emperor's procession pass by. Xiang Yu said, \\"I can replace him.\\" Xiang Liang was shocked and immediately covered his nephew's mouth with his hand. Afterwards, Xiang Liang began to see his nephew in a different light. ==Revolution against the Qin dynasty== Uprisings of Qin Dynasty. Xiang Yu's campaign is shown in blue. In 209 BC, during the reign of Qin Er Shi, peasant rebellions erupted throughout China to overthrow the Qin dynasty, plunging China into a state of anarchy. , the Administrator of Kuaiji, wanted to start a rebellion as well, so he invited Xiang Liang to meet him and discuss their plans. However, the Xiangs lured Yin Tong into a trap and killed him instead, with Xiang Yu personally striking down hundreds of Yin's men. Xiang Liang initiated the rebellion himself and rallied about 8,000 men to support him. Xiang Liang proclaimed himself Administrator of Kuaiji while appointing Xiang Yu as a general. Xiang Liang's revolution force grew in size until it was between 60,000 and 70,000. In 208 BC, Xiang Liang installed Mi Xin as King Huai II of Chu to rally support from those eager to help him overthrow the Qin Dynasty and restore the former Chu state. Xiang Yu distinguished himself as a competent marshal and mighty warrior on the battlefield while participating in the battles against Qin forces. Later that year, Xiang Liang was killed at the Battle of Dingtao against the Qin army led by Zhang Han and the military power of Chu fell into the hands of the king and some other generals. In the winter of 208 BC, another rebel force claiming to restore the Zhao state, led by Zhao Xie, was besieged in Handan by Zhang Han. Zhao Xie requested for reinforcements from Chu. King Huai II granted Xiang Yu the title of \\"Duke of Lu\\" (È≠ØÂÖ¨), and appointed him as a second-in-command to Song Yi, who was ordered to lead an army to reinforce Zhao Xie. At the same time, the king placed Liu Bang in command of another army to attack Guanzhong, the heartland (capital territory) of Qin. The king promised that whoever managed to enter Guanzhong first will be granted the title \\"King of Guanzhong\\". ===Battle of Julu=== The Chu army led by Song Yi and Xiang Yu reached Anyang, some distance away from Julu (Â∑®Èπø; in present-day Xingtai, Hebei), where Zhao Xie's forces had retreated to. Song Yi ordered the troops to lay camp there for 46 days and he refused to accept Xiang Yu's suggestion to proceed further. Xiang Yu took Song Yi by surprise in a meeting and killed him on a charge of treason. Song Yi's other subordinates were afraid of Xiang Yu so they let him become the acting commander-in-chief. Xiang Yu sent a messenger to inform King Huai II and the king approved Xiang's command. In 207 BC, Xiang Yu's army advanced towards Julu and he sent Ying Bu and Zhongli Mo to lead the 20,000 strong vanguard army to cross the river and attack the Qin forces led by Zhang Han, while he followed behind with the remaining majority of the troops. After crossing the river, Xiang Yu ordered his men to sink their boats and destroy all but three days worth of rations, in order to force his men to choose between prevailing against overwhelming odds within three days or die trapped before the walls of the city with no supplies or any hope of escape. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Chu forces scored a great victory after nine engagements, defeating the 300,000 strong Qin army. After the battle, other rebel forces, including those not from Chu, came to join Xiang Yu out of admiration for his martial valour. When Xiang Yu received them at the gate, the rebel chiefs were so fearful of him that they sank to their knees and did not even dare to look up at him. Zhang Han sent his deputy Sima Xin to Xianyang to request for reinforcements and supplies from the Qin imperial court. However, the eunuch Zhao Gao deceived the emperor and the emperor dismissed Zhang Han's request. Zhao Gao even sent assassins to kill Sima Xin when the latter was returning to Zhang Han's camp, but Sima managed to escape alive. In dire straits, Zhang Han and his 200,000 troops eventually surrendered to Xiang Yu in the summer of 207 BC. Xiang Yu perceived the surrendered Qin troops as disloyal and a liability, and had them executed by burying them alive at Xin'an (Êñ∞ÂÆâ; in present-day Yima, Henan). Zhang Han, along with Sima Xin and Dong Yi, were spared from death. Xiang Yu appointed Zhang Han as \\"King of Yong\\", while Sima Xin and Dong Yi were respectively conferred the titles of \\"King of Sai\\" and \\"King of Di\\". ===Feast at Hong Gate=== After his victory at the Battle of Julu, Xiang Yu prepared for an invasion on Guanzhong, the heartland of the Qin dynasty. In the winter of 207 BC, the last Qin ruler Ziying surrendered to Liu Bang in Xianyang (Qin's capital), bringing an end to the Qin Dynasty. When Xiang Yu arrived at Hangu Pass, the eastern gateway to Guanzhong, he saw that the pass was occupied by Liu Bang's troops, a sign that Guanzhong was already under Liu's control. Cao Wushang (ÊõπÁÑ°ÂÇ∑), a subordinate of Liu Bang, sent a messenger to see Xiang Yu, saying that Liu would become King of Guanzhong in accordance with King Huai II's earlier promise, while Ziying would be appointed as Liu's chancellor. Xiang Yu was furious after hearing that. At that time, he had about 400,000 troops under his command while Liu Bang only had a quarter of that number. As strongly encouraged by his advisor Fan Zeng, Xiang Yu invited Liu Bang to attend a feast at Hong Gate and plotted to kill Liu during the banquet. However, Xiang Yu later listened to his uncle Xiang Bo and decided to spare Liu Bang. Liu Bang escaped during the banquet under the pretext of going to the latrine. Xiang Yu paid no attention to Liu Bang's presumptive title and led his troops into Xianyang in 206 BC. He ordered the execution of Ziying and his family, as well as the destruction of the Epang Palace by fire. It was said that Xiang Yu would leave behind a trail of destruction in the places he passed by, and the people of Guanzhong were greatly disappointed with him.Sima Qian. Records of the Grand Historian, Volume 1, Biography of Emperor Gaozu. Despite advice from his subjects to remain in Guanzhong and continue with his conquests, Xiang Yu was insistent on returning to his homeland in Chu. He said, \\"To not return home when one has made his fortune is equivalent to walking on the streets at night in glamourous outfits. Who would notice that?\\" One of his followers said, \\"It is indeed true when people say that the men of Chu are apes dressed in human clothing.\\" Xiang Yu had that man boiled alive when he heard that insult. ==Division of the empire== After the downfall of the Qin dynasty, Xiang Yu offered King Huai II the more honourable title of \\"Emperor Yi of Chu\\" and announced his decision to divide the former Qin Empire. Xiang Yu declared himself \\"Hegemon-King of Western Chu\\" (Ë•øÊ•öÈú∏Áéã) and ruled nine commanderies in the former Liang and Chu territories, with his capital at Pengcheng. In the spring of 206 BC, Xiang Yu divided the former Qin Empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms, to be granted to his subordinates and some leaders of the former rebel forces. He moved some of the rulers of other states to more remote areas and granted the land of Guanzhong to the three surrendered Qin generals, ignoring Emperor Yi's earlier promise to appoint Liu Bang as king of that region. Liu Bang was relocated to the remote Hanzhong area and given the title of \\"King of Han\\" (Êº¢Áéã). Xiang Yu appointed several generals from the rebel coalition as vassal kings, even though these generals were subordinates of other lords, who should rightfully be the kings in place of their followers. Xiang Yu also left out some other important rebel leaders who did not support him earlier, but did contribute to the overthrow of Qin. In winter, Xiang Yu moved Emperor Yi to the remote region of Chen, effectively sending the puppet emperor into exile. At the same time, he issued a secret order to the vassal kings in that area and had the emperor assassinated during his journey in 205 BC. The emperor's death was later used by Liu Bang as political propaganda to justify his war against Xiang Yu. Shortly after the death of Emperor Yi, Xiang Yu had Han Cheng (King of H√°n) put to death and seized Han's lands for himself. Several months later, Tian Rong (chancellor of Qi) took control over the Three Qis (Jiaodong, Qi and Jibei) from their respective kings and reinstated Tian Fu as the King of Qi, but he took over the throne himself afterwards. Similarly, Chen Yu, a former vice chancellor of Zhao, led an uprising against the King of Changshan, Zhang Er, and seized Zhang's domain and reinstalled Zhao Xie as the King of Zhao. ==Chu‚ÄìHan Contention== Map of the Chu‚ÄìHan Contention ===Battle of Pengcheng=== In 206 BC, Liu Bang led his forces to attack Guanzhong. At that time, Xiang Yu was at war with Qi and did not focus on resisting the Han forces. The following year, Liu Bang formed an alliance with another five kingdoms and attacked Western Chu with a 560,000 strong army, capturing Xiang Yu's capital of Pengcheng. Upon hearing this, Xiang Yu led 30,000 men to attack Liu Bang and defeated the latter at the Battle of Pengcheng, with the Han army suffering heavy casualties. ===Battle of Xingyang=== Liu Bang managed to escape after his defeat with Xiang Yu's troops on pursuit. Han troops retreated to Xingyang and defended the city firmly, preventing Chu forces from advancing west any further, but only managed to hold on until 204 BC. Liu Bang's subordinate Ji Xin disguised himself as his lord and surrendered to Xiang Yu, buying time for Liu Bang to escape. When Xiang Yu learned that he had been fooled, he became furious and had Ji Xin burned to death. After the fall of Xingyang, Chu and Han forces were divided on two fronts along present-day Henan. However, Xiang Yu's forces were not faring well on the battlefront north of the Yellow River, as the Han army led by Han Xin defeated his troops in every single battle. At the same time, Liu Bang's ally Peng Yue led his men to harass Xiang Yu's rear. ===Treaty of Hong Canal=== By 203 BC, the tide had turned in favour of Han. Xiang Yu managed to capture Liu Bang's father after a year-long siege and he threatened to boil Liu's father alive if Liu refused to surrender. Liu Bang remarked that he and Xiang Yu were oath brothers,Liu Bang and Xiang Yu became sworn brothers in a ceremony with King Huai II of Chu as their witness in 208 BC. so if Xiang killed Liu's father, he would be guilty of patricide. Xiang Yu requested for an armistice, known as the Treaty of Hong Canal, and returned the hostages he had captured to Liu Bang as part of their agreement. The treaty divided China into east and west under the Chu and Han domains respectively. ===Battle of Guling=== Shortly after, as Xiang Yu was retreating eastwards, Liu Bang renounced the treaty and led his forces to attack Western Chu. Liu Bang sent messengers to Han Xin and Peng Yue, requesting for their assistance in forming a three-pronged attack on Xiang Yu, but Han Xin and Peng Yue did not mobilise their troops and Liu Bang was defeated by Xiang Yu at the Battle of Guling. Liu Bang retreated and reinforced his defences, while sending emissaries to Han Xin and Peng Yue, promising to grant them fiefs and titles of vassal kings if they would join him in attacking Western Chu. ===Defeat and downfall=== In 202 BC, Han armies led by Liu Bang, Han Xin and Peng Yue attacked Western Chu from three sides and trapped Xiang Yu's army, which was low on supplies, at Gaixia. Liu Bang ordered his troops to sing folk songs from the Chu region to create a false impression that Xiang Yu's native land had been conquered by Han forces. The morale of the Chu army plummeted and many of Xiang Yu's troops deserted in despair. Xiang Yu sank into a state of depression and he composed the Song of Gaixia. His wife Consort Yu committed suicide. The next morning, Xiang Yu led about 800 of his remaining elite cavalry on a desperate attempt to break out of the encirclement, with 5,000 enemy troops pursuing them. After crossing the Huai River, Xiang Yu was only left with a few hundred soldiers. They were lost in Yinling (Èô∞Èôµ) and Xiang Yu asked for directions from a farmer, who directed him wrongly to a swamp. When Xiang Yu reached Dongcheng (Êù±Âüé), only 28 men were left, with the Han troops still following him. Xiang Yu made a speech to his men, saying that his downfall was due to Heaven's will and not his personal failure. After that, he led a charge out of the encirclement, killing one Han general in the battle. Xiang Yu then split his men into three groups to confuse the enemy and induce them to split up as well to attack the three groups. Xiang Yu took the Han troops by surprise again and slew another enemy commander, inflicting about 100 casualties on the enemy, while he only lost two men. ==Death== 170px Xiang Yu retreated to the bank of the Wu River (near present-day He County, Maanshan, Anhui) and the ferryman at the ford prepared a boat for him to cross the river, strongly encouraging him to do so because Xiang Yu still had the support of the people from his homeland in the south. Xiang Yu said that he was too ashamed to return home and face his people because none of the first 8,000 men from Jiangdong who followed him on his conquests survived. He refused to cross and ordered his remaining men to dismount, asking the ferryman to take his warhorse, Zhui (È®Ö), back home. Xiang Yu and his men made a last stand against wave after wave of Han forces until only Xiang himself was left alive. Xiang Yu continued to fight on and slew over 100 enemy soldiers, but he had also sustained several wounds all over his body. Just then, Xiang Yu saw an old friend L√º Matong among the Han soldiers, and he said to L√º, \\"I heard that the King of Han (Liu Bang) has placed a price of 1,000 gold and the title of \\"Wanhu Marquis\\" (Ëê¨Êà∂‰æØ; lit. \\"marquis of 10,000 households\\") on my head. Take it then, on account of our friendship.\\" Xiang Yu then committed suicide by slitting his throat with his sword, and a brawl broke out among the Han soldiers at the scene due to the reward offered by Liu Bang, and Xiang Yu's body was said to be dismembered and mutilated in the fight. The reward was eventually claimed by L√º Matong and five others. After Xiang Yu's death, Western Chu surrendered and China was united under Liu Bang's rule, marking the victory of the Han dynasty. Liu Bang held a grand state funeral for Xiang Yu in Gucheng (Á©ÄÂüé; in Dongping County, Taian, Shandong), with the ceremony befitting Xiang's title \\"Duke of Lu\\". Xiang Yu's relatives were spared from death, including Xiang Bo, who saved Liu Bang's life at the Feast at Hong Gate, and they were granted marquis titles. ==Depiction of character== Xiang Yu is depicted as a ruthless leader, in sharp contrast to his rival, Liu Bang. He was a mass murderer, ordering the massacres of entire cities even after they surrendered peacefully. This often led to cities putting up strong resistance, as they knew they would be killed even if they surrendered. The most notorious example of his cruelty was when he ordered the 200,000 surrendered Qin troops to be buried alive after the Battle of Julu, and the gruesome methods of execution he employed against his enemies and critics. Conversely, Liu Bang is portrayed as a shrewd and cunning ruler who could be brutal at times,Sima Qian. Records of the Grand Historian, Volume 8. but forbade his troops from looting the cities they captured and spared the lives of the citizens, earning their support and trust in return. Xiang Yu's story became an example for Confucianists to advocate the idea that leaders should rule with benevolence and not govern by instilling fear in the people. However, his ambitions ended with the collapse of Western Chu, his defeat by Liu Bang, and his death at the early age of around 30. ==Song of Gaixia== The Song of Gaixia (Âûì‰∏ãÊ≠å), translated as The Hegemon's Lament by Burton Watson, Writing Sima Qian's Rhetorical Style into English‚ÄîOn Burton Watson's Translation of Records of the Grand Historian. Xiuying Li, Dalian University of Technology. was a song composed by Xiang Yu while he was trapped by Liu Bang's forces at Gaixia. The lyrics in English as follows are based on Burton Watson's translation: ==Evaluation== The historian Sima Qian, who wrote Xiang Yu's biography in the Records of the Grand Historian, described Xiang as someone who boasted about his achievements and thought highly of himself. Xiang Yu preferred to depend on his personal abilities as opposed to learning with humility from others before him. Sima Qian thought that Xiang Yu had failed to see his own shortcomings and to make attempts to correct his mistakes, even until his death. Sima Qian thought that it was ridiculous when Xiang Yu claimed that his downfall was due to Heaven's will and not his personal failure. Liu Bang's general Han Xin, who was one of Xiang Yu's opponents on the battlefield, made a statement criticising Xiang, \\"A man who turns into a fierce warrior when he encounters a rival stronger than he is, but also one who is sympathetic and soft hearted when he sees someone weaker than he is. Neither was he able to make good use of capable generals nor was he able to support Emperor Yi of Chu, as he killed the emperor. Even though he had the name of a Conqueror, he had already lost the favour of the people.\\"(ÈÅáÂº∑ÂâáÈú∏ÁöÑÂåπÂ§´‰πãÂãáÔºåÂíåÈÅáÂº±ÂâáÊÜêÁöÑÂ©¶‰∫∫‰πã‰ªÅ„ÄÇÊó¢‰∏çËÉΩ‰ªªÁî®Ë≥¢ËÉΩÂ∞áÂ∏•ÔºåÂèàÊõæÈÅ∑ÈÄêÊ•öÁæ©Â∏ùÔºåÁî®ÂÖµË∂ïÁõ°ÊÆ∫Áµï„ÄÇÈõñÂêçÁÇ∫Èú∏ÁéãÔºåÂÖ∂ÂØ¶Ê∞ëÂøÉÁõ°Â§±„ÄÇ) The Tang dynasty poet Du Mu mentioned Xiang Yu in one of his poems Ti Wujiang Ting (È°åÁÉèÊ±ü‰∫≠): \\"Victory or defeat is common in battle. One who can endure humiliation is a true man. There are several talents in Jiangdong, who knows if he (Xiang Yu) can make a comeback?\\"(ÂãùÊïóÂÖµÂÆ∂‰∫ã‰∏çÊúüÔºåÂåÖÁæûÂøçÊÅ•ÊòØÁî∑ÂÖí„ÄÇÊ±üÊù±ÂºüÂ≠êÂ§öÊâç‰øäÔºåÊç≤ÂúüÈáç‰æÜÊú™ÂèØÁü•„ÄÇ) However, the Song dynasty poet Wang Anshi had a different opinion, as he wrote, \\"The warrior is already tired after so many battles. His defeat in the Central Plains is hard to reverse. Although there are talents in Jiangdong, are they willing to help him?\\"(ÁôæÊà∞Áñ≤ÂãûÂ£ØÂ£´Ë°∞Ôºå‰∏≠Âéü‰∏ÄÊïóÂã¢Èõ£Âõû„ÄÇÊ±üÊù±Â≠êÂºü‰ªäÈõñÂú®ÔºåËÇØËàáÂêõÁéãÊç≤Âúü‰æÜ„ÄÇ) The Song Dynasty female poet Li Qingzhao wrote: \\"A hero in life, a king of ghosts after death. Until now we still remember Xiang Yu, who refused to return to Jiangdong.\\"(ÁîüÁï∂‰Ωú‰∫∫ÂÇëÔºåÊ≠ª‰∫¶ÁÇ∫È¨ºÈõÑÔºåËá≥‰ªäÊÄùÈ†ÖÁæΩÔºå‰∏çËÇØÈÅéÊ±üÊù±„ÄÇ) Mao Zedong also once mentioned Xiang Yu, \\"We should use our remaining strength to defeat the enemy, instead of thinking about achieving fame like the Conqueror.\\"(ÂÆúÂ∞áÂâ©ÂãáËøΩÁ™ÆÂØáÔºå‰∏çÂèØÊ≤ΩÂêçÂ≠∏Èú∏Áéã„ÄÇ) In 1964, Mao also pointed out three reasons for Xiang Yu's downfall: not following Fan Zeng's advice to kill Liu Bang at the Feast at Hong Gate and letting Liu leave; adhering firmly to the terms of the peace treaty (without considering that Liu Bang might betray his trust); building his capital at Pengcheng. Xiang Yu is popularly viewed as a leader who possessed great courage but lacked wisdom, and his character is aptly summarised using the Chinese idiom you yong wu mou (), meaning \\"has courage but lacks tactics\\", \\"foolhardy\\". Xiang Yu's battle tactics were studied by later military leaders while his political blunders served as cautionary tales for later rulers. Another Chinese idiom, si mian chu ge (), was also derived from the Battle of Gaixia, and used to describe someone in a desperate situation without help. Another saying by Liu Bang, \\"Having a Fan Zeng but unable to use him\\" (Êúâ‰∏ÄËåÉÂ¢ûËÄå‰∏çËÉΩÁî®), was also used to describe Xiang Yu's reliance on his advisor Fan Zeng and failure to actually listen to Fan's advice. ==Cultural references== Traditional Beijing opera mask for Xiang Yu Xiang Yu's might and prowess in battle has been glorified in Chinese folk tales, poetry, and novels, and he has been the subject of films, television, plays, Chinese operas, video games and comics. His classic image is that of a heroic and brave, but arrogant and bloodthirsty warrior-king. His romance with his wife Consort Yu and his suicide have also added a touch of a tragic hero to his character. ===Poetry, folk tales, novels=== Xiang Yu's might and prowess in battle appears in Chinese folk tales and poetry, e.g., in his final battle.Xiang Yu (Chinese rebel leader) Britannica Online Encyclopedia The Meng Ch'iu, an 8th-century Chinese primer, contains the four- character rhyming couplet: \\"Ji Xin impersonates the Emperor\\". It referred to the episode in the Battle of Xingyang when Ji Xin and 2,000 women disguised themselves as Liu Bang and his army, to distract Xiang Yu in order to buy time for Liu Bang to escape from the city of Xingyang.David Johnson, The City-God Cults of T'ang and Sung China, Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, Vol. 45, No. 2 (Dec., 1985), pp. 363-457 In Romance of the Three Kingdoms, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, Sun Ce is nicknamed \\"Little Conqueror\\" (Â∞èÈú∏Áéã) and is often compared favourably to Xiang Yu by his contemporaries. Sun Ce is best known for his conquests in the Jiangdong region that laid the foundation of the state of Eastern Wu in the Three Kingdoms era. In Water Margin, another of the Four Great Classical Novels, Zhou Tong, one of the 108 outlaws, is nicknamed \\"Little Conqueror\\" for his resemblance to Xiang Yu in appearance. In Jin Ping Mei, (Ci Hua edition) Xiang Yu (È°πÁ±ç) is mentioned as an example of a tragic character in the song at the opening of the first chapter. The character Mata Zyndu in Ken Liu's epic fantasy novel The Grace of Kings is based on Xiang Yu. ===Operas=== A famous Beijing opera, The Hegemon- King Bids His Lady Farewell, depicts the events of Xiang Yu's defeat at the Battle of Gaixia. The title of the play was borrowed as the Chinese title for Chen Kaige's award-winning motion picture Farewell My Concubine. ===Television=== * Portrayed by Shek Sau in the 1985 Hong Kong television series The Battlefield. * Portrayed by Hu Jun in the 2003 Chinese television series The Story of Han Dynasty. * Portrayed by Kwong Wah in the 2004 Hong Kong television series The Conqueror's Story. * Portrayed by Tan Kai in the 2010 Chinese television series The Myth. * Portrayed by Peter Ho in the 2012 Chinese television series King's War. * Portrayed by Ming Dao in the 2012 Chinese television series Beauties of the Emperor. * Portrayed by Qin Junjie in the 2015 Chinese television series The Legend of Qin. * Portrayed by Tim Yu in the 2018 Chinese television series Hero's Dream. === Film === * Portrayed by Ray Lui in the 1994 Hong Kong film The Great Conqueror's Concubine. * Portrayed by Feng Shaofeng in the 2011 Chinese film White Vengeance. * Portrayed by Daniel Wu in the 2012 Chinese film The Last Supper. ===Video games=== Xiang Yu is one of the thirty-two historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI by Koei. He is also featured as a non-playable character (NPC) in the action role- playing game Prince of Qin. Xiang Yu is one of the main two characters in the 1990s Super Nintendo historical simulation game Rise of the Phoenix by the Koei corporation, the other being Liu Bang.

The company received a Royal Charter modelled on that of the British East India Company. Its first directors included The 2nd Duke of Abercorn, Rhodes himself and the South African financier Alfred Beit. Rhodes hoped BSAC would promote colonisation and economic exploitation across much of south-central Africa, as part of the \\"Scramble for Africa\\". However, his main focus was south of the Zambezi, in Mashonaland and the coastal areas to its east, from which he believed the Portuguese could be removed by payment or force, and in the Transvaal, which he hoped would return to British control.J S Galbraith, (1974). Crown and Charter: The early Years of the British South Africa Company, pp. 88, 90. It has been suggested that Rhodes' ambition was to create a zone of British commercial and political influence from \\"Cape to Cairo\\", but this was far beyond the resources of any commercial company to achieve and would not have given investors the financial returns they expected. The BSAC was created in the expectation that the gold fields of Mashonaland would provide funds for the development of other areas of Central Africa, including the mineral wealth of Katanga. When the expected wealth of Mashonaland did not materialise and Katanga was acquired by the Congo Free State, the company had little money left for significant development after building railways, particularly in areas north of the Zambezi. BSAC regarded its lands north of the Zambezi as territory to be held as cheaply as possible for future, rather than immediate, exploitation.J S Galbraith, (1974). Crown and Charter: The early Years of the British South Africa Company, pp. 87, 202‚Äì3. As part of administering Southern Rhodesia until 1923 and Northern Rhodesia until 1924, the BSAC formed what were originally paramilitary forces, but which later included more normal police functions. In addition to the administration of Southern and Northern Rhodesia, the BSAC claimed extensive landholdings and mineral rights in both the Rhodesias and, although its land claims in Southern Rhodesia were nullified in 1918, its land rights in Northern Rhodesia and its mineral rights in Southern Rhodesia had to be bought out in 1924 and 1933 respectively, and its mineral rights in Northern Rhodesia lasted until 1964. The BSAC also created the Rhodesian railway system and owned the railways there until 1947. ==Corporate historyRoyal charter=== The Royal Charter of the British South Africa Company (BSAC) came into effect on 20 December 1889. This was initially for a period of 25 years, later extended for a further 10 years, thus it expired in 1924. The company had been incorporated in October 1888, and much of the time after Rhodes arrived in London in March 1889 (and before its Charter was granted) was taken up in discussions on its terms. In these discussions, Rhodes led the BSAC negotiators. Although the British government broadly supported the scheme, it demanded that it and the High Commissioner for Southern Africa it appointed should have the ultimate responsibility for any territory BSAC might acquire and for approving or rejecting all BSAC actions. Although Clause 3 of the Charter appeared to grant BSAC powers to administer a wide (if unspecified) area of Central Africa on behalf of the British government, this was subject to it obtaining those powers through treaties with local rulers. Under Clauses 4 and 9, the British government also had to accept those treaties and agree to assume any powers to govern that the rulers had granted before authorising BSAC to exercise those powers in its behalf.A Keppel-Jones (1983) Rhodes and Rhodesia: The White Conquest of Zimbabwe 1884‚Äì1902, pp. 112‚Äì3, 133‚Äì6, 315. ===Board divisions=== The first board of directors of the British South Africa Company, 1889. Top Row: Horace Farquhar; Albert Grey; Alfred Beit. Middle Row: the Duke of Fife; C. J. Rhodes (Founder and managing director in South Africa); the Duke of Abercorn. Bottom Row: Lord Gifford, V.C.; Herbert Canning(Secretary); George Cawston. The BSAC was an amalgamation of a London-based group headed by Lord Gifford and George Cawston and backed financially by Baron Nathan de Rothschild, and Rhodes and his South African associates including Alfred Beit with the resources of the De Beers Syndicate and Gold Fields of South Africa. These two groups had originally been in competition but united because of common economic interests. Gifford and Cawston's interests were represented by the Bechuanaland Exploration Company and its offshoot, the Exploring Company. Rhodes and his associates secured the Rudd Concession from the Ndebele king, Lobengula, which was transferred to the Central Search Association (later renamed United Concession Company), and the Exploring Company was given approximately one-quarter of the shares in it. The British South Africa Company leased mineral rights from the Central Search Association, paying it half the net profits from mineral exploitation.J S Galbraith, (1970). The British South Africa Company and the Jameson Raid, pp. 146‚Äì7. From the start, Gifford disliked Rhodes, who he thought had acquired too much power in BSAC and had marginalised him. Cawston supported Rhodes only in those commercial activities likely to make a profit and not in any less commercial ventures. The four other directors were appointed to represent the other shareholders. The dukes of Abercorn and of Fife, respectively chairman and vice-chairman were appointed to give the company prestige but they took little part in running the company. Neither had previous interest in Africa and Fife had no business experience. Albert Grey, later Earl Grey had an active role as a liaison between Rhodes in South Africa and government officials in London. He and Horace Farquhar, a prominent London banker, completed the first Board.J S Galbraith, (1970). The British South Africa Company and the Jameson Raid, pp. 114, 116‚Äì7. ===The Jameson Raid and after=== Sir Henry Loch, the High Commissioner for Southern Africa, had planned the overthrow of the Transvaal Government in the event of a rising in Johannesburg by British subjects denied civil and political rights as early as 1893, and the Colonial Secretary, Lord Ripon, did nothing to discourage this. Loch's successor as High Commissioner from 1895, Sir Hercules Robinson inherited these plans, but none of Loch, Robinson or Ripon took any steps to promote such a rising . Joseph Chamberlain, who succeeded Ripon in 1895, was almost certainly aware that Rhodes was planning a rising, but not the details.P Slinn, (1971). Commercial Concessions and Politics during the Colonial Period: The Role of the British South Africa Company in Northern Rhodesia 1890‚Äì1964, pp. 145‚Äì6. Rhodes and Jameson made plans to assist, and probably to promote, a Johannesburg rising. Earl Grey was the only London-based director to know about plans for the Jameson Raid, and he, like Rhodes and Beit, did not share this knowledge with the other BSAC directors. Grey communicated at least some of the plan to Joseph Chamberlain, who avoided specifically endorsing it.P J S Galbraith, (1970). The British South Africa Company and the Jameson Raid, pp. 148‚Äì9. News of the Raid shocked the BSAC directors who, except for Beit and Grey, knew nothing of the plan. Rhodes at first denied responsibility for Jameson's actions but, in the face of further revelations, he assumed full responsibility for them. The BSAC Board recognised that the company would be attacked, and asked Rhodes to come to London to meet them. At a Board meeting of 5 February 1896, Rhodes claimed that he had given Jameson permission to assist an uprising only, not to start one, and that he believed had the support of the British government. He offered to resign as managing director, but a decision on this was deferred despite the demands of Cawston and Gifford for its acceptance. However, after the trial of the Jameson raiders implicated Rhodes further and following pressure from Chamberlain, Rhodes and Beit were removed as directors in June 1896.J S Galbraith, (1970). The British South Africa Company and the Jameson Raid, pp. 154‚Äì7. After his removal, Rhodes remained a major shareholder in the BSAC and he continued to be involved unofficially in its affairs. In 1898, the Duke of Fife and Lord Farquhar both resigned from the Board; Rhodes and Beit replaced them and another supporter of Rhodes also joined the Board. As Rhodes had recaptured full control over the company, Cawston decided to resign. Lord Gifford, however, remained on the Board, which Rhodes dominated until his death.J S Galbraith, (1970). The British South Africa Company and the Jameson Raid, p. 159. ===After Rhodes=== Rhodes retained effective control of the BSAC until his death in 1902, but after the Jameson Raid the company's relations with the Colonial Office over Rhodesia were difficult, as the Colonial Office was unwilling to recognise the company had to give priority to its commercial interests rather than administration. After Rhodes' death, the BSAC directors attempted to make the company commercially profitable, but until 1924 it was deeply unprofitable because its administrative costs outweighed its commercial income, and it never paid a dividend in that period. After a financial crisis in Britain in 1908, the value of its shares declined sharply: its share capital had to be increased from ¬£6 million to ¬£12 million between 1908 and 1912, and it needed large loans to stay in business.P Slinn, (1971). Commercial Concessions and Politics during the Colonial Period: The Role of the British South Africa Company in Northern Rhodesia 1890‚Äì1964, pp. 366, 371‚Äì2. As the accumulated deficits increased, the value of the shares continued to decline until the 1920s.Klas R√∂nnb√§ck and Oskar Broberg. Capital and Colonialism: The Return on British Investments in Africa 1869-1969. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2019, chap. 10 From around 1920, the company favoured a union of Southern and Northern Rhodesia, followed by their inclusion in the Union of South Africa, and it was in discussion with South African leaders about this. South Africa offered favourable terms for buying out the BSAC's interests, and the company would be relieved of any future administrative costs. The BSAC did not want to be left with responsibility for the administration of Northern Rhodesia when Southern Rhodesia gained responsible government, but did want to preserve its commercial interests there, in particular its mining and land rights. To do this, it had to negotiate a settlement with the British government for both parts of Rhodesia. The two parties began negotiations in an atmosphere of mutual suspicion at the end of 1922, but nevertheless reached an agreement of 29 September 1923 to settle all the outstanding questions on Southern and Northern Rhodesia.P Slinn, (1971). Commercial Concessions and Politics during the Colonial Period: The Role of the British South Africa Company in Northern Rhodesia 1890‚Äì1964, pp. 370‚Äì2. From 1925 until his death in 1937 Sir Henry Birchenough, a former Director of the company, served as President. After 1924 the BSAC's rights allowed it to collect vast sums in royalties, particularly from the development of the Northern Rhodesian Copperbelt, from the late 1920s until its mineral rights were liquidated just before Zambian independence in 1964. In the 1930s, the BSAC was able to collect royalties on all copper mined and was a large shareholder in the main mining companies. Until decolonization, the company therefore became a very lucrative investment opportunity, yielding very high return to investors.Klas R√∂nnb√§ck and Oskar Broberg. Capital and Colonialism: The Return on British Investments in Africa 1869-1969. London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2019, table 10.2 ==Territorial acquisitionsRhodesia=== The first stage in acquiring territory was to enter into treaties with local rulers. Although the Ndebele king, Lobengula, had agreed not to enter into a treaty with any other power without prior British consent, and had granted mining concessions to the BSAC (including the right for the company to protect them), he consistently refused to delegate any general powers of government to the British South Africa Company. However, the BSAC convinced the Colonial Office that it should declare a protectorate on the basis that a group of citizens of the Transvaal Republic led by Louis Adendorff planned to cross the Limpopo River to settle and proclaim a republic in Mashonaland. A protectorate was proclaimed by an Order-in-Council of 9 May 1891, initially covering Mashonaland and later Matabeleland. The Adendorff party did attempt to cross the Limpopo in June 1891, but was turned back by a force of the BSAC police.A Keppel-Jones (1983) Rhodes and Rhodesia: The White Conquest of Zimbabwe 1884‚Äì1902, pp. 176, 315‚Äì6.D N Beach, (1971). The Adendorff Trek in Shona History, pp. 30‚Äì2. The Lozi of the Barotseland formed a kingdom whose king, Lewanika had begun his rule in 1876, but had been driven from power in 1884. After his return in 1885, his concerns about further internal power struggles and the threat of Ndebele raids prompted him to seek European protection. He asked Fran√ßois Coillard of the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society, which had set up a mission to the Lozi, to help him draft a petition seeking a British protectorate. This reached the Colonial Office in August 1889, but no immediate action was taken to accept it. Even before this, Cecil Rhodes, while attempting to obtain a Royal Charter for the BSAC, considered Barotseland as a suitable area for company operations and as a gateway to the copper deposits of Katanga.J S Galbraith, (1974). Crown and Charter: The early Years of the British South Africa Company, pp. 101‚Äì3. Rhodes sent Frank Lochner to Barotseland to obtain a concession and made an offer to the British government to pay the expenses of a Barotseland protectorate. Lochner sponsored the misconception that BSAC represented the British government, and on 27 June 1890, Lewanika gave his consent to an exclusive mineral concession. This (the Lochner Concession) gave the company mining rights over the whole of the area in which Lewanika was paramount ruler in exchange for an annual subsidy and the promise of British protection, a promise that Lochner had no authority to give. However, the BSAC advised the Foreign Office that the Lozi had accepted British protection.J S Galbraith, (1974). Crown and Charter: The early Years of the British South Africa Company, pp. 211‚Äì5, 217‚Äì9. British South Africa Company stamp used to validate emergency issue currency for use in Bulawayo, authorized by Hugh Marshall Hole. The Foreign Office had reservations over the nature and extent of the supposed protectorate and it never sanctioned the Lochner Concession, because it did not grant BSAC any administrative rights and it involved monopolies, prohibited in the BSAC Charter.Government of Northern Rhodesia (Zambia). (1964). White Paper on British South Africa Company's claims to Mineral Royalties, p. 1140. However, in negotiations with the Portuguese government, Barotseland was claimed to fall within the British sphere of influence and the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891 allocated the Barotse Kingdom's territory to the British sphere, although the boundary with Angola was not fixed until 1905.J S Galbraith, (1974). Crown and charter: The early Years of the British South Africa Company, pp. 222‚Äì3. Lewanika protested that the terms of the treaty had been misrepresented to him. No BSAC Administrator was sent to Barotseland until 1895, and the first Administrator, Forbes who remained until 1897, did little to establish an administration. As the Foreign Office was not convinced that the Lochner Concession had established a British protectorate over Barotseland or given BSAC any rights to administer the territory, it considered that a new concession was necessary. It agreed in 1896 that a BSAC official would be appointed as Resident Commissioner to secure this concession. The first appointee died before taking up his post, but in October 1897, Robert Coryndon reached Barotseland as Resident Commissioner. Coryndon, a former secretary of Cecil Rhodes and member of the Pioneer Column, had been proposed by the BSAC, and his appointment was approved by the High Commissioner for South Africa as representing the British government. In his capacity as Resident, Coryndon declared Barotseland to be a British protectorate, resolving its previously anomalous position. Coryndon also confirmed that the 1890 mineral concession gave the BSAC no right to make land grants.G L Caplan, (1970). The Elites of Barotseland, 1878‚Äì1969: A Political History of Zambia's Western Province, pp. 65‚Äì7. In 1897 Lewanika signed a new concession (the Coryndon Concession) that gave the BSAC the rights to make land grants and to establish jurisdiction in parallel to the king's courts. Next, in 1900, Lewanika signed a further agreement, (the Barotse Concession), which resolved some details that were in dispute following the earlier concessions and was drafted in terms compatible with the Barotseland-North Western Rhodesia Order in Council, 1899. .G L Caplan, (1970). The Elites of Barotseland, 1878‚Äì1969: A Political History of Zambia's Western Province, pp. 75‚Äì6.P E N Tindall, (1967). A History of Central Africa, p. 133. Up to 1899, Northern Rhodesia outside of Barotseland was governed according to the Order- in-Council of 9 May 1891, which did not fix clear boundaries to the area involved. Before 1911, Northern Rhodesia was administered as two separate territories, North-Western Rhodesia and North-Eastern Rhodesia. The former was recognised as British territory by the Barotseland and North-Western Rhodesia Order-in-Council of 1899 and the later by the North-Eastern Rhodesia Order-in- Council of 1900. Both Orders-in-Council regularised the position of the BSAC Administrators, the first of whom for North- Eastern Rhodesia was appointed in 1895. In North-Western Rhodesia the first Administrator was appointed for Barotseland in 1897, becoming Administrator for all North-Western Rhodesia in 1900.P E N Tindall, (1967). A History of Central Africa, p. 134.E A Walter, (1963).The Cambridge History of the British Empire: South Africa, Rhodesia and the High Commission Territories, pp. 696‚Äì7. ===Other areas=== In 1890, Alfred Sharpe undertook an expedition with the objective of acquiring Katanga. He only managed to make treaties with local rulers in North-Eastern Rhodesia, a number of whom later claimed that the contents of the treaty documents had been misrepresented to them. Katanga became part of the Congo Free State. The boundary between the Congo Free State and British territory was fixed by a treaty in 1894. It was only after this treaty and the appointment of a separate Administrator for North- Eastern Rhodesia in 1895 that the area was brought under effective BSAC control.G Macola, (2002) The Kingdom of Kazembe: History and Politics in North-Eastern Zambia and Katanga to 1950, pp. 161‚Äì4. The British South Africa Company also considered acquiring interests in Bechuanaland Protectorate and Nyasaland, which was initially called the British Central Africa Protectorate. During negotiations for its charter in 1889, the company discussed the possibilities of taking over the administration of Bechuanaland, which was already a British protectorate, and of working with, and possibly amalgamating with, the African Lakes Company which was operating in Nyasaland. On 29 October 1889, a Royal Charter authorised the formation of the British South Africa Company's Police. In the event, BSAC did not take over the administration of Bechuanaland, but from 1892 it took over the cost of the Bechuanaland Border Police, which from 1896 was merged with the British South Africa Police.J S Galbraith, (1974). Crown and Charter: The early Years of the British South Africa Company, pp. 109‚Äì11, 116.R.S. Roberts, (1974) Towards a History of Rhodesia's Armed Forces, Rhodesian History, vol. 5. On 1 Apr 1896 the Bechuanaland Border Police was renamed as the Bechuanaland Mounted Police (BMP). The African Lakes Company was itself attempting to become a Chartered Company in the late 1880s, and Rhodes discussed its possible amalgamation with the BSAC in 1889. However, the Foreign Office judged the African Lakes Company as unsuitable to administer any territory, and by 1890 BSAC wished to take control of that company rather than amalgamate with it. The Lakes Company directors resisted, but by 1893 they had been ousted. In 1891, the British Central Africa Protectorate was proclaimed on the understanding that the BSAC would contribute to the costs of its administration. However, its Commissioner, Harry Johnson, refused to act as a BSAC appointee, in particular on Rhodes' demand that all Crown lands in the protectorate should be transferred to BSAC control and that Johnson should also facilitate the transfer of African lands to itJ S Galbraith, (1974). Crown and Charter: The early Years of the British South Africa Company, pp. 97‚Äì8, 207, 230‚Äì3. ===Dispute with Portugal=== At the start of the 19th century, effective Portuguese government in Mozambique was limited to the ports of Mozambique Island, Ibo, Quelimane, Sofala, Inhambane and Louren√ßo Marques and the outposts at Sena and Tete in the Zambezi valley. Although Portugal claimed sovereignty over Angoche and a number of smaller Muslim coastal towns, these were virtually independent.M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 129, 137, 159‚Äì63.R Oliver and A Atmore, (1986). The African Middle Ages, 1400‚Äì1800, pp. 163‚Äì4, 191, 195. In the Zambezi valley, Portugal had also initiated the Prazo system of large leased estates under nominal Portuguese rule. By the end of the 18th century, this area in the valleys of the Zambezi and lower Shire River were controlled by a few families that claimed to be Portuguese subjects but which were virtually independent.M Newitt, (1969). The Portuguese on the Zambezi: An Historical Interpretation of the Prazo system, pp. 67‚Äì8. In the interior of what is today southern and central Mozambique, there was not even a pretence of Portuguese control. The nadir of Portuguese fortunes was reached in the 1830s and 1840s when Louren√ßo Marques was sacked in 1833 and Sofala in 1835; Zumbo was abandoned in 1836; Afro-Portuguese settlers near Vila de Sena were forced to pay tribute to the Gaza Empire and Angoche fought off a Portuguese attempt to prevent it from slave-trading in 1847. However, around 1840 the Portuguese government embarked on a series of military campaigns to bring the prazos and the Muslim coastal towns under its effective control.M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 260, 274‚Äì5, 282, 287.M Newitt, (1969). The Portuguese on the Zambezi: An Historical Interpretation of the Prazo system, pp. 80‚Äì2. The General Act of the Berlin Conference dated 26 February 1885, which introduced the principle of effective occupation was potentially damaging to Portuguese claims in Mozambique. Article 34 required a power acquiring land on the coasts of Africa outside of its previous possessions to notify the other signatories of the Act so they could protest against such claims. Article 35 of the Act provided that rights could only be acquired over previously uncolonised lands if the power claiming them had established sufficient authority there to protect existing rights and the freedom of trade. This normally implied making treaties with local rulers, establishing an administration and exercising police powers. Initially, Portugal claimed that the Berlin Treaty did not apply, and it was not required to issue notifications or establish effective occupation, as Portugal's claim to the Mozambique coast had existed for centuries and had been unchallenged.A Keppel-Jones (1983) Rhodes and Rhodesia: The White Conquest of Zimbabwe 1884‚Äì1902, pp 190‚Äì1.General Act of the Berlin Conference. However, British officials did not accept this interpretation, as Henry O'Neill, the British consul based at Mozambique Island said in January 1884: \\"There is a field of action open to her (England) in South Africa which only a slight political barrier interposes to shut her out from. We refer, of course, to the area of Portuguese rule. This, it is true, at present is an undefinable area. Portugal has been a colonising power only in name. To speak of Portuguese colonies in East Africa is to speak of a mere fiction‚Äîa fiction colourably sustained by a few scattered seaboard settlements, beyond whose narrow littoral and local limits colonisation and government have no existence.\\"Quoted in J C Paiva de Andrada, (1885). Relatorio de uma viagem √°s terras dos Landins, at Project Gutenberg To forestall British designs on the parts of Mozambique and the interior that O'Neill claimed Portugal did not occupy, Joaquim Carlos Paiva de Andrada was commissioned in 1884 to establish effective occupation, and he was active in four areas. Firstly, in 1884 he established the town of Beira and Portuguese occupation of much of Sofala Province. Secondly, also in 1884, he acquired a concession of an area within a 180 kilometre radius of Zumbo, which had been reoccupied and west of which Afro-Portuguese families had traded and settled since the 1860s. Although Andrada did not establish any administration immediately, in 1889 an outpost was established beyond the junction of the Zambezi and Kafue River and an administrative district of Zumbo was established.J C Paiva de Andrada, (1886). Relatorio de uma viagem √°s terras do Changamira, at Project GutenbergJ C Paiva de Andrada, (1885). Relatorio de uma viagem √°s terras dos LandinsM Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 337‚Äì8, 344. Thirdly, in 1889 Andrada was granted another concession over Manica, which covered the areas both of the Manica Province of Mozambique and the Manicaland Province of Zimbabwe. Andrada succeeded in obtaining treaties over much of this area and establishing a rudimentary administration but he was arrested in November 1890 by British South Africa Company troops and expelled. Finally, also in 1889, Andrada crossed northern Mashonaland, approximately the area of the Mashonaland Central Province of Zimbabwe, obtaining treaties. He failed to inform the Portuguese government of these treaties, so these claims were not formally notified to other powers, as required by the Berlin Treaty. The British government refused to submit any disputed claims to arbitration, and on 11 January 1890, Lord Salisbury sent the British Ultimatum of 1890 to the Portuguese government demanded the withdrawal of the Portuguese troops from the areas where Portuguese and British interests in Africa overlapped.M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 345‚Äì7. ===Fixing boundaries=== The final stage in acquiring territory was to make bi-lateral treaties with other European powers. The Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1891 was an agreement signed in Lisbon on 11 June 1891 between the United Kingdom and Portugal. It fixed the boundaries between the territories administered by the British South Africa Company in Mashonaland and Matabeleland, now parts of Zimbabwe, and North-Eastern Rhodesia (now part of Zambia) and Portuguese Mozambique. It divided Manica, granting the western portion to the British South Africa Company. It also fixed the boundaries between the BSAC-administered territory of North-Western Rhodesia (now in Zambia), and Portuguese Angola.M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 341‚Äì7, 353‚Äì4. Teresa Pinto Coelho, (2006). Lord Salisbury's 1890 Ultimatum to Portugal and Anglo-Portuguese Relations, pp. 6‚Äì7. The northern border of the British territories was agreed as part of an Anglo-German Convention in 1890. The border between the British Central Africa Protectorate and the territory of the British South Africa Company in what is today Zambia was fixed in 1891 at the drainage divide between Lake Malawi and the Luangwa River.J G Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, pp. 86‚Äì7. ===Early administration=== The terms of the treaties under which the various protectorates were created north or south of the Zambezi provided for the rulers that signed them to retain significant powers over their own people. Despite this, the British South Africa Company either ended the powers of traditional rulers through warfare or eroded them by encouraging its own officials to take most of them over. By the end of the first decade of the 20th century, those traditional rulers that remained were restricted to largely ceremonial roles only.R I Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa: The Making of Malawi and Zambia, 1873‚Äì1964, pp. 21‚Äì3. The BSAC appointed an Administrator of Mashonaland, who was intended to have a similar function to a colonial governor, and later assistants in charge of districts. The first Administrator, A. R. Colquhoun, was appointed in October 1890, soon after the Pioneer Column had arrived at Fort Salisbury. As first, the British government refused to recognise Colquhoun, and placed the governor of Bechuanaland in immediate charge of the new protectorate, with the High Commissioner for South Africa given oversight of it. The governor legitimated the Administrator in July 1891 by appointing him Chief Magistrate, and as the British government did not want the expense of administration, it acquiesced to BSAC control. The Administrator, as Chief Magistrate, appointed assistants charged with keeping order in the various parts of Mashonaland, and from these a district administration developed. However, under Colquhoun and his successor from August 1891, Leander Starr Jameson, there were less than 20 administrative staff, mostly inexperienced, so government was minimal.A Keppel-Jones (1983) Rhodes and Rhodesia: The White Conquest of Zimbabwe 1884‚Äì1902, pp. 318‚Äì9.J S Galbraith, (1974). Crown and Charter: The early Years of the British South Africa Company, p. 261. As the High Commissioner was usually resident in Cape Town, a Resident Commissioner was appointed to represent him in Rhodesia. The early BSAC Administrators had a dual role, being appointed Administrators by the company and Chief Magistrate by the Crown. Their position was regularised in 1894, when the British government appointed the British South Africa Company to administer what was beginning to be called Rhodesia, which at that time was not split into Northern and Southern sections. A Legislative Council was created in 1898 in Southern Rhodesia to advise the BSAC Administrator and the High Commissioner for South Africa in legal matters.A Keppel-Jones (1983) Rhodes and Rhodesia: The White Conquest of Zimbabwe 1884‚Äì1902, pp. 318‚Äì9, 321‚Äì4.E A Walker, (1963). The Cambridge History of the British Empire: South Africa, Rhodesia and the High Commission Territories, pp. 682‚Äì4. Administration north of the Zambezi was rudimentary before 1901. In North-Eastern Rhodesia, Abercorn and Fife were fortified outposts and the Administrator of North- Eastern Rhodesia was resident in Blantyre in the British Central Africa Protectorate until Fort Jameson was founded in 1899 as its headquarters. In Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia, there was no Secretariat until 1901.R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa : The Making of Malawi and Zambia, 1873‚Äì1964, p. 25. ==Land policiesSouthern Rhodesia=== After the entry of the Pioneer Column into Southern Rhodesia, the provision of land for European settlers was one of the first matters to be taken up by the British South Africa Company. Matabele authority ceased, freehold ownership of land was introduced, and large tracts were acquired by the BSAC for alienation to Europeans.B N Floyd, (1962). Land Apportionment in Southern Rhodesia, p. 572. Jameson, who became Administrator of Mashonaland in 1891, was Rhodes' appointee and he executed what he thought were Rhodes' plans with little supervision from Rhodes and none from the BSAC Board in London. Jameson made very large land grants between 1891 and 1893 for little return until the directors' complaints stopped him (although Rhodes' approved several other large grants up to 1896). This policy discouraged later settlers, who could only acquire good quality land at a high price from these grantees.J S Galbraith, (1974). Crown and Charter: The early Years of the British South Africa Company, pp. 277‚Äì81. As English law applied in both in Southern Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia, all land that had not already been alienated should in principle have been Crown land. However, in both territories, BSAC claimed ownership of the land not in other private ownership either because it, not the Crown, had conquered it or under the various concessions it had obtained. It also claimed the right to alienate this land as its owner. In 1890 and 1891, the Colonial Office and the High Commissioner accepted that BSAC had obtained title to the land in Mashonaland.J S Galbraith, (1974). Crown and Charter: The early Years of the British South Africa Company, pp. 319‚Äì21, 323. After the Matebele wars, the company also claimed in 1894 to have the right to dispose of all land in Matebeleland, on the basis that the Ndebele king, Lobengula had owned it, but had forfeited it. The Colonial Office objected, but only to the extent of requiring BSAC to reserve sufficient lands for the African population.J S Galbraith, (1974). Crown and Charter: The early Years of the British South Africa Company, pp. 337‚Äì8. In 1894, a Land Commission was appointed to deal with the settlement of Africans on the land. The Commission recommended that two large territories be set aside for native occupation, the Shangani and Gwaai Reserves in Matabeleland, of about 2,486,000 acres. Before the arrival of the Europeans, Africans had held nearly 100,000,000 acres in what became Southern Rhodesia. The Land Commission's plan showed such poor judgment, and the bases of allocation were so ill-considered, that the attempt to confine the native population within these two areas was never really practicable. Failure to make suitable provision for African lands may have been one of the prime causes of the Matabele and Mashona rebellions of 1896. Following these rebellions, BSAC was required to assign sufficient land to Southern Rhodesian Africans for their agricultural and pastoral requirements, including access to sufficient water. Native Reserves were set up under this directive, which by 1902 had an estimated indigenous population of 530,000. Although later modifications were made, the basic pattern of land allocation persisted until independence. The European district officers who responsible for defining the reserves were advised to allow between 9 and 15 acres of arable land for each family, and adequate pasture, but they had little geographic knowledge of the country and no maps. In 1910, a Native Affairs Committee of Enquiry was set up, which made very few changes. The Committee's land apportionment was 19 million acres for Europeans and 21.4 million acres for Native Reserves with an African population of about 700,000. A further 51.6 million acres was unassigned, but available for future alienation to Europeans.B N Floyd, (1962). Land Apportionment in Southern Rhodesia, pp. 573‚Äì4. In 1918, he Judicial Committee of the Privy Council decided in the Southern Rhodesia case that, even although the British South Africa Company may have conquered Mashonaland and Matabeleland, it had acted as an agent of the British Crown, so the land had become Crown land. The court recognised that the indigenous people of what became Southern Rhodesia, had previously owned the land, but had lost it through the BSAC conquest.J Gilbert, (2006). Indigenous Peoples' Land Rights Under International Law: From Victims to Actors, pp. 18‚Äì19. However, even after the Privy Council decision, the British government allowed BSAC to continue to administer the unalienated lands in Southern Rhodesia and agreed that, when their Charter expired, it was to recover the loss it had incurred in administering the territory either from future sales of these lands or from the British government. In negotiations for the ending of the Charter in 1923, the British government agreed to fund part of this deficit, but placed the obligation to pay off the rest on Southern Rhodesia itself.Memorandum by the Colonial Secretary on Rhodesia, 19 April 1923. In 1920, some smaller reserves were reorganised, and 83 Native Reserves of 21.6 million acres were recognised, which were for the exclusive use and occupation almost 900,000 Africans. Of this total, about 3 million acres were unsuitable for any agricultural use. A review after the end of BSAC administration in 1925 enforced stricter segregation of European and African land, while allowing only a little more land for African use.B N Floyd, (1962). Land Apportionment in Southern Rhodesia, p. 574. ===Northern Rhodesia=== In Northern Rhodesia, the BSAC claimed ownership of all the unalienated land in the territory, and the right to alienate it. Europeans occupied land along the line of the railway and near the towns, but generally there was no land shortage, as the population density was lower than in Southern Rhodesia, and the European population was much lower. In 1913, BSAC drew up plans for Native Reserves along Southern Rhodesian lines, outside which Africans would have no right to own or occupy land, but these plans were not implemented until 1928, after company administration ended.R I Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa : The Making of Malawi and Zambia, 1873‚Äì1964, p. 37. The Privy Council decision on Southern Rhodesia raised questions about the BSAC claim to the unalienated lands north of the Zambezi. However, the company's claim in Northern Rhodesia was based on concessions granted rather than conquest and, although a parliamentary Committee in 1921 recommended that these claims also should be referred to the Privy Council, the British government preferred to negotiate an overall settlement for the end of BSAC administration in Northern Rhodesia. This effectively acknowledged the company's claim. Under an Agreement of 29 September 1923, the Northern Rhodesian government took over the entire control of lands previously controlled by BSAC from 1 April 1924, paying the company half the net rents and the proceeds of certain land sales.G. D. Clough, (1924). The Constitutional Changes in Northern Rhodesia and Matters Incidental to the Transition, p. 281. ==RailwaysRailway policies=== The British South Africa Company was responsible for building the Rhodesian railway system in the period of primary construction which ended in 1911, when the main line through Northern Rhodesia reached the Congo border and the Katanga copper mines. Rhodes' original intention was for a railway extending across the Zambesi to Lake Tanganyika, popularly considered as part of a great \\"Cape to Cairo\\" railway linking all the British colonies of Africa. Rhodes was as much a capitalist in his motivation as a visionary, and when little gold was found in Mashonaland, he accepted that even the scheme to reach Lake Tanganyika had no economic justification. Railways built by private companies without government subsidies need enough of the type of traffic that can pay high freight rates to recover their construction costs. The agricultural products that fuelled much of Rhodesia's early economic growth could not provide this traffic; large quantities of minerals could. Most early railways in Africa were built by the British government rather than Chartered Companies. The need to raise capital and produce dividends prevented most Chartered Companies from undertaking such infrastructure investments. However, in the early period of railway construction, the BSAC obtained finance from South African companies including Consolidated Gold Fields and De Beers in which Rhodes was a dominant force. BSAC also benefitted from the large, but not unlimited personal fortunes of Rhodes and Beit before their deaths.J Lunn, (1992). The Political Economy of Primary Railway Construction in the Rhodesias, 1890‚Äì1911, pp. 239, 244.S Katzenellenbogen, (1974). Zambia and Rhodesia: Prisoners of the Past: A Note on the History of Railway Politics in Central Africa, pp. 63‚Äì4. ===Development of routes=== Lord Gifford and his Bechuanaland Exploring Company had won the right to construct a private railway north from the terminus of the Cape Government Railways at Kimberley into Bechuanaland in 1888. Rhodes was initially against this extension, in part because Gifford was a competitor but also for reasons of Cape politics. However, when Rhodes and Gifford joined forces, BSAC had to take on this railway obligation to gain its Charter. Rhodes promised that BSAC would spend ¬£500,000 on building a railway through Bechuanaland, half of BSAC's total initial share capital. The railway reached Vryburg in 1890, stopping there until 1893 because of the poor financial state of BSAC and disappointing reports about gold in Mashonaland and Matabeleland. BSAC remained cautious about railway building until 1896, when African uprisings threatening its investment made railway links to Southern Rhodesia imperative.J Lunn, (1992). The Political Economy of Primary Railway Construction in the Rhodesias, 1890‚Äì1911, pp. 240‚Äì1 The line from Kimberley reached Bulawayo in 1897, and a connection to Salisbury was completed in 1902. By then Southern Rhodesia already had a rail outlet to the Mozambican port of Beira. This was completed by the Beira Railway Company, a subsidiary company of the BSAC, as a narrow gauge railway as far as Umtali in 1898. In the next year, a line from Salisbury to Umtali was completed which, like the Kimberley to Bulawayo line, was at the Cape gauge of 3 feet 6 inches. The Umtali to Beira section was widened to Cape gauge in 1899 and 1900. These lines were proposed before the economic potential of the Rhodesias was fully known, and in the hope that the expected gold discoveries would promote economic development. Rhodesia's gold deposits proved disappointing, and it was the coal of Wankie that first provided the traffic and revenue to fund railway construction to the north. After the discovery of its huge coal reserves, a branch to Wankie from the main line from Bulawayo (which had been extended to cross the Victoria Falls in 1902) was completed in 1903.M Newitt, (1995). A History of Mozambique, pp. 395, 402. The next section was to Broken Hill, which the railway reached in 1906. BSAC was assured that there would be much traffic from its lead and zinc mines, but this did not materialise because technical mining problems. The railway could not meet the costs of the construction loans, and the company faced major financial problems, which were already serious because of the cost of widening the Beira railway. The only area likely to generate sufficient mineral traffic to relieve these debts was Katanga. Initially, the Congo Free State had concluded that Katanga's copper deposits were not rich enough to justify the capital cost of building a railway to the coast, but expeditions between 1899 and 1901 proved their value. Copper deposits found in Northern Rhodesia before the First World War proved uneconomic to develop.S Katzenellenbogen, (1974). Zambia and Rhodesia: Prisoners of the Past: A Note on the History of Railway Politics in Central Africa, p. 64. In 1906 Union Mini√®re du Haut Katanga was formed to exploit the Katanga mines. King Leopold favoured a railway route entirely in Congolese territory, linked to the Congo River. An Angolan railway from Lobito Bay to Katanga was also proposed, but in 1908, the BSAC agreed with Leopold to continuing the Rhodesian railway to Elizabethville and the mines. Between 1912, when full-scale copper production began, until 1928 when a Congolese line was completed, almost all of Katanga's copper was shipped over the Rhodesian network to Beira. Even after the Congo route was opened, up to a third of Katanga's copper went to Beira, and the mine's the supply of coal and coke mostly came from Wankie, the cheapest available source. This railway's revenue from Katanga enabled it to carry agricultural produce at low rates. Large-scale development of the Copperbelt only began in the late 1920s, with an increasing world market for copper. Transport was no problem as only short branches had to be built to connect the Copperbelt to the main line. The Beira route was well established and the BSAC wanted to prevent the Copperbelt companies taking advantage of other routes it did not control. The Benguela Railway to Angola, completed in 1931, provided the shortest, most direct route for copper from both Katanga and Northern Rhodesia, but it was never used to full capacity because both the Congo and the Rhodesias restricted its traffic in favour of their own lines.S Katzenellenbogen, (1974). Zambia and Rhodesia: Prisoners of the Past: A Note on the History of Railway Politics in Central Africa, pp. 65‚Äì6. When the BSAC administration of the Rhodesias was terminated, an agreement between the Colonial Secretary and the company of 29 September 1923 recognised that BSAC was entitled to protection because of the size of its railway investment in Northern and Southern Rhodesia. The agreement required the governors of each territory to refer any Bill authorising the construction of new railways or altering the rates that the existing railways charged to the Colonial Secretary. This prevented the legislatures of Northern or Southern Rhodesia from introducing competition or exerting pressure on the BSAC-controlled railways to reduce rates without British government sanction.G. D. Clough, (1924). The Constitutional Changes in Northern Rhodesia and Matters Incidental to the Transition, p. 282. ===Railways and the settlers=== European settlers had two main criticisms of British South Africa Company railway policy. Firstly, that its financial arrangements unfairly benefited the company and its shareholders, and secondly, that the settlers paid for these benefits through exorbitant railway rates. Although the allegations were probably ill- founded, they caused tensions between the settlers and the BSAC. On the shorter east coast route from Beira, running expenses were high because of construction debts and because the Mozambique Company, which was granted the original concession to build the railway in 1891, imposed a transit duty of up to 3% on goods destined for Rhodesia in return for the sub-concession to the Beira Railway Company. From 1914, the European settlers had a majority in the Advisory Council, and called for the replacement of BSAC control of the railways through nationalisation. In 1923 responsible government was achieved, but rather outright nationalisation, the settler government opted for a form of public control under the Railway Act of 1926. This left BSAC as owner of the railways, which were called Beira and Mashonaland and Rhodesia Railways until 1927, and Rhodesia Railways Limited after. This remained the situation until 1947, when the Government of Southern Rhodesian acquired the assets of Rhodesia Railways Limited.J Lunn, (1992). The Political Economy of Primary Railway Construction in the Rhodesias, 1890‚Äì1911, pp. 250, 252‚Äì4. ==Commercial activitiesEarly trading=== The company was empowered to trade with African rulers such as King Lobengula; to form banks; to own, manage and grant or distribute land, and to raise a police force (the British South Africa Police). In return, the company agreed to develop the territory it controlled, to respect existing African laws, to allow free trade within its territory and to respect all religions. Rhodes and the white settlers attracted to the company's territory set their sights for ever more mineral rights and more territorial concessions from the African peoples, establishing their own governments, and introducing laws with little concern or respect for African laws. The BSAC was not able to generate enough profit to pay its shareholders dividends until after it lost direct administrative control over Rhodesia in 1923. Africa from Cairo to the Cape (according to Cecil Rhodes) ===Mining=== BSAC claims Initially, the British South Africa Company claimed mineral rights in both Northern and Southern Rhodesia. During the period of its Charter, the BSAC was not involved in mining directly, but received mineral royalties and held shares in mining companies. Often the main source of income of these companies was not in mining itself but in speculation markets. In Moshanaland, complaints arose at the delay of development of mines in order to fuel speculation profits further.Rhodesia Herald, 6 April 1894 In 1923, the British government agreed that it would take over the administration of both Southern and Northern Rhodesia from BSAC. The Agreement for Southern Rhodesia provided that the Company's mineral rights there should be granted protection, and any Bill under which the Southern Rhodesian legislature proposed to alter arrangements for collecting mining revenues or imposing any new tax or duty on minerals would require British government. The same condition applied to any Northern Rhodesian legislation.G. D. Clough, (1924). The Constitutional Changes in Northern Rhodesia and Matters Incidental to the Transition, Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law, p. 282. In 1933, the company sold its mineral exploration rights south of the Zambezi to the Southern Rhodesian government, but retained its rights in Northern Rhodesian mineral rights, as well as its interests in mining, railways, real estate and agriculture across southern Africa.A G Hopkins, (1976). Imperial Business in Africa. Part I: Sources, p.31. BSAC claimed to own mineral rights over the whole of Northern Rhodesia under one series of concessions granted between 1890 and 1910 by Lewanika covering a poorly defined area of Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia, and under a second series negotiated by Joseph Thomson and Alfred Sharpe in 1890 and 1891 with local chiefs covering a disputed area of North-Eastern Rhodesia. This claim was accepted by the British Government.Government of Northern Rhodesia (Zambia). (1964). White Paper on British South Africa Company's claims to Mineral Royalties, pp. 1135, 1138. After the Charter ended, BSAC joined a group of nine South African and British companies which financed the development of Nchanga Mines, to prevent them falling under US control. However, its main concern was to receive royalties.S Cunningham, (1981). The Copper Industry in Zambia: Foreign Mining Companies in a Developing Country, pp. 57‚Äì8. Ancient surface copper workings were known at Kansanshi (near Solwezi), Bwana Mkubwa and Luanshya, all on what later became known as the Copperbelt, and BSAC exploration in the 1890s indicated there were significant deposits in the area. However, they could not be commercially exploited until a railway had been built. A railway bridge across the Zambezi was constructed in 1903 and the line was continued northward, reaching Broken Hill in 1906, where the lead and zinc vanadium mine was opened, and reaching the Belgian Congo border in 1909. At that time, mining had started in Katanga, where rich copper oxide ores occurred near the surface. In Northern Rhodesia, the surface ores were of poorer quality, and copper was only worked intermittently at Bwana Mkubwa, until in 1924 rich copper sulphide ores were discovered about 100 feet below the surface.R W Steel, (1957) The Copperbelt of Northern Rhodesia, pp. 83‚Äì4. In 1922, the Southern Rhodesian voters rejected the option of inclusion in the Union of South Africa and opted for responsible government: the Northern Rhodesian settlers were not consulted. The BSAC wanted to give up responsibility for administering Northern Rhodesia, but to preserve its mining and land rights by negotiating a settlement with the British government for both parts of Rhodesia. For Northern Rhodesia, the most important provision of that agreement was that the Crown would recognise that BSAC was the owner of the mineral rights acquired under the concessions obtained from Lewanika in North Western Rhodesia Certificates of Claim issued by Harry Johnston in North Eastern Rhodesia.P Slinn, (1971). Commercial Concessions and Politics during the Colonial Period: The Role of the British South Africa Company in Northern Rhodesia 1890‚Äì1964, PP. 371‚Äì3. Under the Northern Rhodesian settlement, the company dropped its claim for reimbursement of a ¬£l.6 million administrative deficit: in return the British Government agreed to give the BSAC half the net revenue from certain rents and land sales and recognised (or appeared to recognise) the company as the owner of Northern Rhodesia's mineral rights in perpetuity. The British Government could have bought out these rights by paying BSAC ¬£l.6 million to meet its reimbursement claim, but declined to make the money available. This agreement was criticised then and later time by both African and European inhabitants of the territory. The elected unofficial members of the Legislative Council pressed for the royalties issue to be referred to the Privy Council, as the BSAC's title to unalienated land in Southern Rhodesia had been. Instead, for forty years up to Zambian independence, successive British Governments recognised the BSAC as owner of all underground minerals in Northern Rhodesia, and compelled anyone mining them to pay royalties to the company.Government of Northern Rhodesia (Zambia), (1964). White Paper on British South Africa Company's claims to Mineral Royalties, pp. 1134‚Äì5. In 1923, the Northern Rhodesian copper industry was little developed, and the British government did not anticipate the future value of these mineral rights. It regarded them as a not very important part of the overall deal with the company. The lack of any challenge to the BSAC's claims and the decision not to refer them to the Privy Council led to suspicion that the company received favoured treatment. There were family links between a junior Colonial Office minister and the BSAC director leading its negotiations, but no evidence to suggest this led to any bias. The most probable explanation is that the importance of the minerals was overlooked in the haste to achieve a settlement. Because of lack of time, the agreement was not approved by the Attorney-General.P Slinn, (1971). Commercial Concessions and Politics during the Colonial Period: The Role of the British South Africa Company in Northern Rhodesia 1890‚Äì1964, pp. 372‚Äì3. The 1923 Agreement stated that the Crown recognised British South Africa Company mineral rights acquired under the concessions either from Lewanika in Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia or under Certificates of Claim in North-Eastern Rhodesia. These concessions did not cover all of Northern Rhodesia. In particular, they could not have conveyed mineral rights in the area of the Copperbelt from which most of the BSAC's royalties came, as the Copperbelt was outside these areas. However, the British Government had legal advice that the Colonial Office's recognition of the BSAC's rights in practice over a long period, and specific recognition of those rights in Rhodesia mining legislation, prevented it from challenging the rights.Government of Northern Rhodesia (Zambia), (1964). White Paper on British South Africa Company's claims to Mineral Royalties, pp. 1138‚Äì9. Claims disputed The first attempts to challenge BSAC royalty claims were made by the Governor of Northern Rhodesia between 1935 and 1937. The Governor, Sir Hubert Young, attempted to convince the Colonial Office that BSAC only owned mineral rights in the areas of the concessions from Lewanika and the Certificates of Claim from Johnston. This excluded most of the Copperbelt, as the area east of the Kafue River had never been ruled by Lewanika. The Colonial Office response was that BSAC ownership of mineral rights throughout Northern Rhodesia had been accepted in practice, and the references to the Lewanika concessions and Certificates of Claim should not be interpreted in a narrow sense.P Slinn, (1971). Commercial Concessions and Politics during the Colonial Period: The Role of the British South Africa Company in Northern Rhodesia 1890‚Äì1964, pp. 375‚Äì6. Northern Rhodesian settler politicians were not convinced by the Colonial Office arguments, in particular the suggestion that, since the British government had previously recognised the BSAC claims, it could not challenge them now on the basis of a reinterpretation of terms of the 1923 agreement. Settler representatives proposed either that the BSAC mineral rights should be bought out or that punitive levels of tax should be imposed on BSAC royalties. After years of BSAC obstruction, the company was forced to agree in 1950 that it would surrender their mineral rights in 1986 without compensation, and meanwhile give 20% of its royalties to the Northern Rhodesian government.P Slinn, (1971). Commercial Concessions and Politics during the Colonial Period: The Role of the British South Africa Company in Northern Rhodesia 1890‚Äì1964, pp. 377‚Äì8. The 1950 agreement continued through the period of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, but at the end of Federation in 1963 the African leaders of what became Zambia sought its revision, proposing to buy out the British South Africa Company's mineral rights for a lump sum. The BSAC refused, and the Northern Rhodesian government of Kenneth Kaunda commissioned a full legal enquiry into the validity of the company's claims. The results were published as a White Paper which considered the validity of commercial rights held and exercised under the colonial legislative and administrative system.P Slinn, (1971). Commercial Concessions and Politics during the Colonial Period: The Role of the British South Africa Company in Northern Rhodesia 1890‚Äì1964, pp. 380‚Äì1. The Northern Rhodesian government argued that many of the treaties on which BSAC relied were of doubtful validity and probably could not have effectively transferred mineral rights. Even if the treaties were valid, none if them covered the Copperbelt, and any subsequent agreements merely confirmed the company's rights if they were originally valid: they did not give the treaties retrospective validity. It further argued that, as the British government had wrongly allowed the BSAC to claim royalties it was not entitled to, the British government should pay any compensation it thought the company was due, and not place this burden on an independent Zambia. Shortly before the planned date for independence of 24 October 1964, Kaunda threatened to expropriate the BSAC immediately afterwards if no agreement were reached. On 23 October, BSAC agreed to give up any mineral rights it might have in return for compensation of ¬£4 million, the British and Zambian governments paying half each.P Slinn, (1971). Commercial Concessions and Politics during the Colonial Period: The Role of the British South Africa Company in Northern Rhodesia 1890‚Äì1964, pp. 382‚Äì3. ===Financial returns=== Traders of B.S.A.C stock profited handsomely from the speculative trading of the stock which was trading for multiple times higher that its nominal book value on the LSE and the Rhodesian Stock Exchange which was initiated in the Masonic Assembly Room on 20 June 1894.George Karekwaivenani, A History of the Rhodesian Stock Exchange, p.14 .A History of the Zimbabwean Stock Exchange An investor who invested in the original one million shares at ¬£1 each and participated in each rights issue up to 1904, would have paid an average of ¬£1.66 for each share. No dividends were received before 1924, but from then the average annual dividend for the next 26 years was 7.5 pence, a poor rate of return. However, from 1950, dividend rates increased sharply, reaching 75 pence a share in 1960, largely from Northern Rhodesian copper royalties. Each share was split two-for-one in 1955 and each of the new shares was exchanged for three Charter Consolidated shares at the beginning of 1965.T Lloyd, (1972). Africa and Hobson's Imperialism, p. 144. ==Security== Clause 3 of the BSAC Charter allowed the company to obtain powers necessary for the preservation of public order in, or for the protection of, the territories comprised in its concessions, and Clause 10 allowed the company to establish and maintain a police force. This did not permit the formation of an army but BSAC created a paramilitary force of mounted infantrymen in 1889 which was virtually its army and which allowed it to defeat and replace the Matabele kingdom and then overcome resistance of the Shona north of the Limpopo river in the First Matabele War and Second Matabele War. It was the first British use of the Maxim gun in combat (causing five thousand Ndebele casualties). The company carved out and administered a territory which it named Zambezia, and later, Rhodesia, which now covers the area occupied by the republics of Zambia and Zimbabwe. ===Southern Rhodesia=== At first, the BSAC force was named the British South Africa Company's Police, but from 1896 it was called the British South Africa Police. The Colonial Office initially authorised a force of 100 men, but Rhodes increased this to 480 before the Pioneer Column entered Mashonaland.J S Galbraith, (1974). Crown and Charter: The early Years of the British South Africa Company, pp. 143‚Äì6, 149. Its numbers had risen to 650 men by the end of 1890, an unsustainable burden on the BSAC resources. Rhodes ordered a reduction in its manpower to 100 at the end of 1891, and later to only 40 men. This was supplemented by the Mashonaland Horse, an unpaid volunteer force of up to 500 men. The police force was greatly increased in size at the time of the First Matabele War, although much if this increase was in the form of volunteer police reservists.J S Galbraith, (1974). Crown and Charter: The early Years of the British South Africa Company, pp. 262‚Äì3. Although the police force had been created by the BSAC and was at first under the command of a company official, after the Jameson Raid it was renamed the British South Africa Police and ceased to be a company force. From then, it reported to the British High Commissioner for South Africa, not the BSAC, and was commanded by a British-appointed officer. This British South Africa Police had four divisions: two policed the countryside (but not the towns) of Matabeleland and of Mashonaland, another covered \\"North Zambesia\\" until the creation of the Barotse Native Police in 1899 and the fourth dealt with Bechuanaland until its own police force was formed in 1903. Also in 1903, the previously separate urban police forces were combined as the Southern Rhodesia Constabulary and handed over to BSAC control. In 1909, the Matabeleland and Mashonaland divisions were handed back to BSAC control and the separate urban police force was amalgamated with the British South Africa Police. Only in 1909 did the British South Africa Police constitute a police force for the whole of Southern Rhodesia and for Southern Rhodesia only. The British South Africa Police was initially formed as a wholly European force, but in 1903 an African unit was organised as the British South African Native Police. In 1909, this was merged into the British South Africa Police, which thereafter had an increasing number of African police officers. The volunteer forces raised for the Matabele wars and Mashona rebellion were disbanded soon after, but the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers, raised for service in the Boer War, remained in being and in 1914 formed the basis of the 1st and 2nd Rhodesia Regiments. Although these were severely reduced in size after the First World War, they formed the basis of the Rhodesian Territorial Force, set up in 1926 after the end of BSAC administration. ===Northern Rhodesia=== The BSAC considered that its territory north of the Zambezi was more suitable for a largely African police force than a European one. However, at first the British South Africa Police patrolled the north of the Zambezi in North Western Rhodesia, although its European troops were expensive and prone to diseases. This force and its replacements were paramilitaries, although there was a small force of European civil police in the towns. The British South Africa Police were replaced by the Barotse Native Police force, which was formed in 1902 (other sources date this as 1899 or 1901). This had a high proportion of European NCOs as well as all European officers and was merged into the Northern Rhodesia Police in 1911. Initially, Harry Johnson in the British Central Africa Protectorate had responsibility for North Eastern Rhodesia and Central Africa forces, including Sikh and African troops, were used there until 1899. Until 1903, local magistrates recruited their own local police, but in that year a North Eastern Rhodesia Constabulary was formed, which had only a few white officers, all its NCOs and troopers being African. This was also merged into the Northern Rhodesia Police in 1912, which then numbered only 18 European and 775 African in six companies, divided between the headquarters of the various districts. The Northern Rhodesia Police remained after the end of BSAC administration.L H Gann, (1958). The Birth of a Plural Society: The Development of Northern Rhodesia under the British South Africa Company, 1894‚Äì1914, pp. 67, 74‚Äì5, 106‚Äì7.J G Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, pp. 87, 90‚Äì2. ===Medal=== In 1896, Queen Victoria sanctioned the issue by the British South Africa Company of a medal to troops who had been engaged in the First Matabele War. In 1897, the Queen sanctioned another medal for those engaged in the two campaigns of the Second Matabele War: Rhodesia (1896) and Mashonaland (1897). The government of Southern Rhodesia re-issued the medal to commemorate the earlier 1890 Pioneer Column, in 1927. The arms of the British South Africa Company ==PoliticsLegislature and administration=== A legislative council for Southern Rhodesia was created in 1898 to advise the BSAC Administrator and the High Commissioner for South Africa on legal matters. Initially, this had a minority of elected seats, and the electorate was formed almost exclusively of those better-off white settlers who held BSAC shares. Over time as more settlers arrived, disputes between settlers and BSAC grew, and the company attempted to keep these in check by extending the franchise to some non-shareholders. However, in 1914, the Royal Charter was renewed on condition that settlers in Southern Rhodesia were given increased political rights, and from 1914, there was an elected majority on the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council.P E N Tindall, (1967). A History of Central Africa, Praeger p. 267.E A Walker, (1963). The Cambridge History of the British Empire: South Africa, Rhodesia and the High Commission Territories, pp. 682, 684‚Äì5. In Northern Rhodesia, there was neither an Executive Council nor a legislative council, but only an Advisory Council, which until 1917 consisted entirely of officials. After 1917 and a few nominees were added to represent the small European minority: Northern Rhodesia had no elected representation while under BSAC rule.R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa : The Making of Malawi and Zambia, 1873‚Äì1964, p. 26. Provision for elected unofficial members was only made after BSAC rule there came to an end in 1924. In both parts of Rhodesia, the BSAC Administrators were required to submit all draft Proclamations affecting Europeans to the High Commissioner for South Africa for approval before they were issued. The High Commissioner could in theory, and subject to certain restrictions, also make, alter or repeal Proclamations for the administration of justice, the raising of revenue, and for the peace, order and good government of either territory, without reference to their Administrators, although this power was never used.G. D. Clough, (1924). The Constitutional Changes in Northern Rhodesia and Matters Incidental to the Transition, Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law, Third Series, Vol. 6, No. 4 pp. 279‚Äì80.E A Walker, (1963). The Cambridge History of the British Empire: South Africa, Rhodesia and the High Commission Territories, p. 686. The British South Africa Company was planning to centralise the administration of the two Rhodesias at the time of the Jameson Raid in 1896. Following the raid, the British government increased its oversight of BSAC affairs in Southern Rhodesia, and insisted on a separate administration in Northern Rhodesia. In both 1915 and 1921, BSAC again failed to set up a single administration for both Rhodesias. In part, this was because the Southern Rhodesian settlers feared that it more would be difficult for a united Rhodesian state to achieve responsible government.H. I Wetherell, (1979) Settler Expansionism in Central Africa: The Imperial Response of 1931 and Subsequent Implications, pp. 211‚Äì2. ===Self-government=== In 1917, the Responsible Government Association was formed as a political party to press for responsible government, and fought the 1920 Legislative Council election in opposition to those advocating union with the Union of South Africa. When the British courts decided that the ultimate ownership of all land which had not already been alienated into private ownership lay with the Crown, not with BSAC, the campaign a self-government gained strength.R Blake, (1977). A History of Rhodesia, p. 179. In 1921, General Smuts and his government wished for the early admission of Southern Rhodesia into the Union of South Africa. When the Union was established, Natal and the Free State were given representation in the Union Parliament considerably in excess of the number of their electors, and Smuts promised that this would apply in the case of Rhodesia, which would receive 12 to 15 seats in the Union Parliament, which then had 134 members. Smuts also promised that South Africa would make the financial provision necessary to buy out the commercial rights of the BSAC. If those rights continued under responsible government, they would create a serious financial problem for that government. In 1922, the company entered negotiations with the Union government for the incorporation of Southern Rhodesia. However, as the BSAC charter was due to expire in 1924, a referendum was held in 1922 in which the electorate was given a choice between responsible government and entry into the Union of South Africa. Those in favour of responsible government won a significant, but not overwhelming, majority. In 1923, the British government chose not to renew the Company's charter, and instead accorded self-governing colony status to Southern Rhodesia and protectorate status to Northern Rhodesia.E A Walker, (1963). The Cambridge History of the British Empire: South Africa, Rhodesia and the High Commission Territories, pp. 690‚Äì1. ===The end of BSAC administration=== An agreement of 29 September 1923 between the British South Africa Company and the Colonial Secretary settled the outstanding issues relating to Southern and Northern Rhodesia. It terminated the company's administration of Northern Rhodesia by the British South Africa Company as from 1 April 1924: Northern Rhodesia continued to be a protectorate, but now governed by a Governor. All laws were to continue in force, and all rights reserved to indigenous peoples under treaties they had made with BSAC also continued in force. From 1 April 1924, control of all lands that the company claimed in Northern Rhodesia, were taken over by the Northern Rhodesian administration, to administer in the interests of their African populations, but BSAC were to receive half the net rents from these lands.G. D. Clough, (1924). The Constitutional Changes in Northern Rhodesia and Matters Incidental to the Transition, Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law, Third Series, Vol. 6, No. 4 p. 281. ==Merger== In 1964, the company handed over its mineral rights to the government of Zambia, and the following year, the business of the British South Africa Company was merged with the Central Mining & Investment Corporation Ltd and The Consolidated Mines Selection Company Ltd into the mining and industrial business of Charter Consolidated Ltd, of which slightly over one-third of the shares were owned by the British/South African mining company Anglo American plc. In the 1980s the company disposed of its overseas mining concerns to concentrate on its British engineering interests. In 1993 Charter Consolidated Ltd changed its name to Charter plc, and in 2008 to Charter Limited, which is incorporated in England and Wales, Company Number 02794949. The British South Africa Company still exists, and is registered as a non-trading business incorporated in England and Wales, Company Number ZC000011. ==Gazettes published by the company== * British South Africa Company Government Gazette * North-Eastern Rhodesia Gazette * Northern Rhodesia Government Gazette ==See also== * Sir Henry Birchenough, 1st Baronet * Ellis Robins, 1st Baron Robins ==References== ==Sources== *D N Beach, (1971).

These simple offerings to the dead were perhaps introduced into the Latium by Aeneas, who poured wine and scattered violet flowers on Anchises' tomb.Littlewood. Latomus, pg. 922 Ovid tells of a time when Romans, in the midst of war, neglected Feralia, which prompted the spirits of the departed to rise from their graves in anger, howling and roaming the streets. After this event, tribute to the tombs were then made and the ghastly hauntings ceased. To indicate public mourning, marriages of any kind were prohibited on the Feralia, and Ovid urged mothers, brides, and widows to refrain from lighting their wedding torches. Magistrates stopped wearing their insigniaBrill's New Pauly. \\"Parentalia.\\" and any worship of the gods was prohibited as it \\"should be hidden behind closed temple doors; no incense on the altar, no fire on the hearth.\\" ==Rites and tradition== As concerns public rites nothing of them survives,Dum√©zil. Archaic Roman Religion. pg. 367 however on this day as described by Ovid, an old drunken woman (anus ebria)Cokayne. Experiencing Old Age in Ancient Rome. pg. 145 (from google books. see References). sits in a circle with other girls performing rites in the name of the mute goddess Tacita who is identified with the nymph Lara or Larunda.Brill's New Pauly. \\"Tacita.\\" The ritual consists of the old woman placing three bits of incense, with three of her fingers, beneath a threshold where a mouse is unknowingly buried. She then rolls seven black beans in her mouth, and smears the head of a fish with pitch, impaling it with a bronze needle, and roasting it in a fire. After she formally declaims the purpose of her actions, as customary in Greco-Roman magic ritual, saying, \\"I have gagged spiteful tongues and muzzled unfriendly mouths\\" (Hostiles linguas inimicaque uinximus ora), she departs intoxicated. The use of the black beans in the old woman's ritual may be related to rites that lend themselves to another festival of the dead in the month of May, called Lemuria.Ovid. Fasti, Book V. During Lemuria the dead ancestor spirits, particularly the unburied, called lemures, emerge from their graves and visit the homes in which they had lived. It was then necessary to confront the unwelcome spirits and lure them out of one's house using specific actions and chants. According to Ovid, this includes the involvement of black beans to lure a spirit out of the home. \\"And after washing his (the householder) hands clean in spring water, he turns, and first he receives black beans and throws them away with face averted; but while he throws them, he says: 'These I cast; with these beans I redeem me and mine.' This he says nine times, without looking back: the shade is thought to gather the beans, and to follow unseen behind. Again he touches water, and clashes Temesan bronze, and asks the shade to go out of his house. When he has said nine times, 'Ghosts of my fathers, go forth!' he looks back, and thinks that he has duly performed the sacred rites.\\" Perhaps the black beans carried with them connotations of warding away or dispelling bad things in general, whether it be unwelcome spirits haunting a household as seen during Lemuria, or preventing undesired gossip towards an individual as in the old hag's ritual during Feralia. Also, in the context of sacrifices, the black beans are similar to the black animals used in sacrifice to the 'chthonic deities'. It is implied through Ovid's choice of words, \\"hostiles linguas\\" and \\"inimicaque ora\\", that the ritual is intended to curb gossip about a girl's reputation. Gossip of such a nature and its consequences are the subject for the cause, which Ovid offers, of the Dea Tacita festival, which was held on the same day as the Feralia. Ovid then tells a story to explain the origins of Dea Tacitia, starting with Jupiter's untamed lust for the nymph Juturna. Juturna, aware of Jupiter's lust for her, hid within the Hazelwood forest and dove into her sisters' waters. Jupiter then gathered all the nymphs in Latium seeking their help in capturing Juturna, saying, \\"Your sister is spiting herself by shunning her own advantage, an entanglement with the highest god. Look out for us both. What will be a great pleasure for me will be in your sister's great interest. Block her as she flees at the bank of the river to keep her from jumping into its waters.\\" One of the informed nymphs, Lara, could not hold her tongue and warned Juturna to flee. In addition, she approached Jupiter's wife Juno, saying, \\"Your husband loves the Naiad Juturna.\\" As a result, Jupiter rips out Lara's tongue in anger and summons Mercury to escort her to be a nymph in the Underworld. During this mission, Mercury becomes lustful of Lara and copulates with her, begetting twins. These twins become the Lares, the guardians of intersections who watch over the city of Rome. ==See also== *Parentalia *Lemuria (festival) ==Notes== ==References== *Antoni, Silke (Kiel). \\"Tacita.\\" Brill's New Pauly.

At the University of Alabama he was a member of Alpha Sigma Phi. He practiced law in Gadsden from 1935 to 1968 and was a member of the Alabama House of Representatives from 1938 to 1942. He resigned from the state legislature to enter active duty in the United States Naval Reserve from 1943 to 1946. He again ran for office after World War II and was a member of the Alabama Senate from 1946 to 1950. He was the 17th and 20th Lieutenant Governor of Alabama from 1951 to 1955 and again from 1963 to 1967.James Allen, Lieutenant Governors of Alabama In 1968, James Allen was elected to succeed the retiring Democratic U.S. Senator J. Lister Hill of Montgomery. Allen won 638,774 (76 percent) to 201,227 (24 percent) for his Republican opponent, Perry O. Hooper, Sr.Billy Hathorn, \\"A Dozen Years in the Political Wilderness: The Alabama Republican Party, 1966‚Äì1978\\", Gulf Coast Historical Review, Vol. 9, No. 2 (Spring 1994), p. 30 Like his Republican Senate colleague, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, James Allen was a master of parliamentary procedure. He was considered to have revived the filibuster rule during his nearly nine years as a senator. James Allen was known as one of the most conservative Democrats in the chamber, more conservative even than many Republicans at that time. He was an active opponent of the Panama Canal Treaty of 1978. James Allen received one vote for the Republican vice-presidential nomination at the 1976 Republican National Convention. In March 1974, James Allen stated that Governor of Alabama George Wallace would run in the 1976 Democratic primary and that he believed the Wallace campaign would seek to prevent a repeat of the previous election cycle where the popular vote was not translated into his support from delegates. Following the 1974 midterm elections, James Allen pledged to use filibusters against liberal officeholders in favor of large spending in the upcoming 94th United States Congress, reasoning that some of the newly elected Democrats could favor larger spending than the members they had replaced: \\"I don't feel the voters have given any mandate toward increased expenditures. The people's wishes as indicated by the vote are for us to curtail unnecessary programs and cut Federal spending.\\" It was thought at this time that James Allen \\"could emerge as a leader of the Senate's conservative bloc with the retirement of Senator Sam J. Ervin, Democrat of North Carolina, and the aging of other conservatives\\". In December 1974, James Allen led a group of senators in a filibuster against an amendment previously passed in the House of Representatives designed to curb Government enforcement of desegregation orders. The filibuster ended with a two‚Äìthirds majority voting 56 to 27 to end debate on language revising the amendment, marking only the 19th time a filibuster was ended in such a manner in Senate history. James Allen stated that the closure move would result in a legislative delay, Hugh Scott replying, \\"The supplemental is being delayed by the opposition of the Senator from Alabama to the Scott-Mansfield amendment.\\" James Allen served in the Senate until his death of a heart attack on June 1, 1978, at the resort community of Gulf Shores, Alabama. He is interred at Forrest Cemetery in Gadsden. Governor George C. Wallace, under whom James Allen served previously as lieutenant governor, appointed Allen's widow, Maryon Pittman Allen, to succeed him in the Senate. However, Mrs. Allen lost the special Democratic primary to fill the remaining two years of her husband's term to Donald W. Stewart of Anniston. Stewart then defeated James D. Martin of Gadsden, who became the Republican nominee after a primary had already been held between George W. Nichols and Elvin McCary, also of Anniston, and a longtime friend of Senator James Allen's. For the change in nominees to occur, Nichols, who defeated McCary in the special Republican primary, had to agree to step down from the race.\\"A Dozen Years in the Political Wilderness\\", pp. 36-37 == See also == * List of United States Congress members who died in office (1950‚Äì99) == References == ==External links== Category:1912 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Alabama Democrats Category:Alabama lawyers Category:American members of the Churches of Christ Category:Democratic Party United States senators Category:Lieutenant Governors of Alabama Category:United States senators from Alabama Category:Alabama state senators Category:Members of the Alabama House of Representatives Category:University of Alabama alumni Category:University of Alabama School of Law alumni Category:United States Navy sailors Category:American naval personnel of World War II Category:Politicians from Gadsden, Alabama Category:People from Gulf Shores, Alabama Category:20th- century American lawyers Category:20th-century American politicians Category:People who died in office ","title":"James Allen (Alabama politician)"},{"id":"822355","text":"A leather cat o' nine tails pictured with a U.S. dollar bill for size comparison. A U.S. dollar bill is about 15 cm (6 in) long, so the total length would be about 75 cm (30 in). The cat o' nine tails, commonly shortened to the cat, is a type of multi-tailed flail that originated as an implement for severe physical punishment, notably in the Royal Navy and British Army, and also as a judicial punishment in Britain and some other countries. ==Etymology== The term first appears in 1681 in reports of a London murder. The term came into wider circulation in 1695 after its mention by a character in William Congreve's play Love for Love,William Congreve's love for love and first mention of cat o nine tails see page 32 and the fourth dialogue down spoken by Ben. although the design is much older. It was probably so called in reference to its \\"claws\\", which inflict parallel wounds. There are equivalent terms in many languages, usually strictly translating, and also some analogous terms referring to a similar instrument's number of tails (cord or leather), such as the Dutch zevenstaart (seven tail[s]), negenstaart (nine tail[s]), the Spanish gato de nueve colas or the Italian gatto a nove code. ==Description== The cat is made up of nine knotted thongs of cotton cord, about long, designed to lacerate the skin and cause intense pain. It traditionally has nine thongs as a result of the manner in which rope is plaited. Thinner rope is made from three strands of yarn plaited together, and thicker rope from three strands of thinner rope plaited together. To make a cat o' nine tails, a rope is unravelled into three small ropes, each of which is unravelled again. ===Variations=== Variations exist, either named cat (of x tails) or not, such as the whip used on adult Egyptian prisoners which had a cord on a cudgel branching into seven tails, each with six knots, used only on adult men, with boys being subject to caning, until Egypt banned the use of the device in 2001.Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, Egypt: 2001, U.S. State Department. Sometimes the term \\"cat\\" is used incorrectly to describe various other punitive flogging devices with multiple tails in any number, even one made from 80 twigs (so rather a limp birch) to flog a drunk or other offender instead of 80 lashes normally applicable under shariah law. The closed cat, one without tails, was called a starter. ==Historical punishmentsNaval types and use=== The naval cat, also known as the \\"captain's daughter\\" (which in principle was used under his authority) weighed about and was composed of a handle connected to nine thinner pieces of line, with each line knotted several times along its length. Formal floggings‚Äîthose ordered by captain or court martial‚Äîwere administered ceremonially on deck, the crew being summoned to \\"witness punishment\\" and the prisoner being brought forward by marines with fixed bayonets. Sailor being flogged with a cat-o'-nine-tails while four sailors are waiting for their turn to flog him. During the period of the Napoleonic Wars, the naval cat's handle was made of rope about long and about in diameter, and was traditionally covered with red baize cloth. The tails were made of cord about in diameter and typically . Drunkenness or striking an officer might incur a dozen lashes, which could be administered on the authority of the ship's captain. Greater punishments were generally administered following a formal court martial, with Royal Navy records reflecting some standard penalties of two hundred lashes for desertion, three hundred for mutiny, and up to five hundred for theft. The offence of sodomy generally drew the death penalty, though one eighteenth century court martial awarded a punishment of one thousand lashes - a roughly equivalent sentence as there was no likelihood of survival. A new cat was made for each flogging by a bosun's mate and kept in a red baize bag until use. If several dozen lashes were awarded, each could be administered by a fresh bosun's mate‚Äîa left-handed one could be included to assure extra painful crisscrossing of the wounds. One dozen was usually awarded as a highly sensitizing prelude to running the gauntlet. For summary punishment of Royal Navy boys, a lighter model was made, the reduced cat, also known as boy's cat, boy's pussy or just pussy, that had only five tails of smooth whip cord. If formally convicted by a court martial, however, even boys would suffer the punishment of the adult cat. While adult sailors received their lashes on the back, they were administered to boys on the bare posterior, usually while \\"kissing the gunner's daughter\\" (bending over a gun barrel), just as boys' lighter \\"daily\\" chastisement was usually over their (often naked) rear-end (mainly with a cane‚Äîthis could be applied to the hand, but captains generally refused such impractical disablement‚Äîor a rope's end). Bare-bottom discipline was a tradition of the English upper and middle classes, who frequented public schools, so midshipmen (trainee officers, usually from 'good families', getting a cheaper equivalent education by enlisting) were not spared, at best sometimes allowed to receive their lashes inside a cabin. Still, it is reported that the 'infantile' embarrassment of bare-bottom punishment was believed essential for optimal deterrence; cocky miscreants might brave the pain of the adult cat in the macho spirit of \\"taking it like a man\\" or even as a \\"badge of honour\\". On board training ships, where most of the crew were boys, the cat was never introduced, but their bare bottoms risked, as in other naval establishments on land, \\"the sting of the birch\\", another favourite in public schools. Flogging round the fleet \\"The severest form of flogging was a flogging round the fleet. The number of lashes was divided by the number of ships in port and the offender was rowed between ships for each ship's company to witness the punishment.\\"Broadside. Crime and Punishment Penalties of hundreds of lashes were imposed for the gravest offences, including sedition and mutiny. The prisoner was rowed around the fleet in an open boat and received a number of his lashes at each ship in turn, for as long as the surgeon allowed. Sentences often took months or years to complete, depending on how much a man was expected to bear at a time. Normally 250‚Äì500 lashes would kill a man, as infections would spread.\\"Flogging Round the Fleet After the flogging was completed, the sailor's lacerated back was frequently rinsed with brine or seawater, which was thought to serve as a crude antiseptic (although it is now known that seawater contains significant microbial components). Although the purpose was to control infection, it caused the sailor to endure additional pain, and gave rise to the expression \\"rubbing salt into his wounds\\", which came to mean vindictively or gratuitously increasing a punishment or injury already imposed. ===British Army=== The British Army had a similar multiple whip, though much lighter in construction, made of a drumstick with attached strings. The flogger was usually a drummer rather than a strong bosun's mate. Flogging with the cat o' nine tails fell into disuse around 1870. Whereas the British naval cat rarely cut (contrary to graphic films) but rather abraded the skin, the falls (tresses) of the British Army cat were lighter (around ) and the string was in fact codline - a very dense material akin to tarred string. Although the total whip would weigh only a fraction of a naval rope cat, the thin, dense codline tresses were far more likely to cut the skin. It was also used elsewhere in the empire, notably at the penal colonies in Australia, and also in Canada (a dominion in 1867) where it was used until 1881. An 1812 drawingFort Henry, Canada. shows a drummer apparently lashing the buttocks of a naked soldier who is tied with spread legs on an A-frame made from sergeants' half pikes. In many places, soldiers were generally flogged stripped to the waist. ===Prison usage=== The cat-o'-nine-tails was also used on adult convicts in prisons; a 1951 memorandumMemorandum to prisons re: Birches and Cats-o'-nine tails, PRO HO 323/13, National Archives. (possibly confirming earlier practice) ordered all UK male prisons to use only cat o' nine tails (and birches) from a national stock at Wandsworth prison, where they were to be 'thoroughly' tested before being supplied in triplicate to a prison whenever a flogging was pending for use as prison discipline. In the 20th century, this use was confined to very serious cases involving violence against a prison officer, and each flogging had to be confirmed by central government. ===Penal colonies in Australia=== Especially harsh floggings were given with it in secondary penal colonies of early colonial Australia, particularly at such places as Norfolk Island (apparently this had 9 leather thongs, each with a lead weight, meant as the ultimate deterrent for hardened life-convicts), Port Arthur and Moreton Bay (now Brisbane). ==Modern uses and types== Judicial corporal punishment was removed from the statute book in Great Britain in 1948. The cat was still being used in Australia in 1957 and is still in use in a few Commonwealth countries, although the cane is used in more countries. Judicial corporal punishment has been abolished or declared unconstitutional since 1997 in Jamaica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, South Africa, Zambia, Uganda (in 2001) and Fiji (in 2002). However, some former colonies in the Caribbean have reinstated flogging with the cat. Antigua and Barbuda reinstated it in 1990, followed by the Bahamas in 1991 (where, however, it was subsequently banned by law)Bahamas Penal Code . and Barbados in 1993 (only to be formally declared inhumane and thus unconstitutional by the Barbados Supreme Court). Trinidad and Tobago never banned the \\"cat\\". Under the Corporal Punishment (Offenders over Sixteen) Act 1953, use of the \\"cat\\" was limited to male offenders over the age of 16. The age limit was raised in 2000 to 18. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago has been accused of torture and \\"cruel, inhuman and degrading\\" treatment of prisoners, and in 2005 was ordered by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to pay US$50,000 for \\"moral damages\\" to a prisoner who had received 15 strokes of the \\"cat\\" plus expenses for his medical and psychological care; it is unclear whether the Court's decisions were implemented. Trinidad and Tobago did not acknowledge the Court's jurisdiction, since it had denounced the American Convention on Human Rights several years before the Court started hearing this case.Case of Caesar v.

The pseudowire emulates the operation of a \\"transparent wire\\" carrying the service, but it is realized that this emulation will rarely be perfect. The service being carried over the \\"wire\\" may be Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Frame Relay, Ethernet or time-division multiplexing (TDM) while the packet network may be Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS), Internet Protocol (IPv4 or IPv6), or Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol Version 3 (L2TPv3). The first pseudowire specifications were the Martini draft for ATM pseudowires, and the TDMoIP draft for transport of E1/T1 over IP.. In 2001, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) set up the PWE3 working group, which was chartered to develop an architecture for service provider edge-to-edge pseudowires, and service-specific documents detailing the encapsulation techniques. Other standardization forums, including the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the MFA Forum, are also active in producing standards and implementation agreements for pseudowires. Starting from 2006, telecom operators like BellSouth, Supercomm, AT&T;, and Verizon began to invest more into pseudo-wire technology, pointing out its advantages to Ethernet in particular. Pseudo-wires tie services together across multiple transport technologies, including Ethernet over SONET, WDM, GPON, DSL, and WiMax. Over the next decade, the technology became mainstream. In 2017 Cisco published a comprehensive document explaining the concept, troubleshooting, and configuration details for all Cisco equipment pieces, which supported pseudo-wire.

Allen, died in office. ==Early life== Maryon Pittman was born in Meridian, Mississippi, in 1925. The following year the family moved to Birmingham, Alabama, where her father established a tractor dealership and where she grew up and attended public school. From 1944 to 1947, she studied journalism at the University of Alabama but did not graduate. In 1946, while a student, she married Joshua Mullins. The couple had three children, who were still young in 1959 when the marriage ended in divorce. Following her divorce, she went to work, first as an insurance agent and later as the editor of the women's sections for five weekly newspapers in the Birmingham area. That experience led to a position as a staff writer for the Birmingham News. It was in that capacity that she met James \\"Jim\\" Allen, then lieutenant governor of Alabama, in 1964 when she interviewed him in connection with a speech he had delivered to the Alabama Federation of Women's Clubs. She and Allen, a widower with two children, were attracted to each other and married in August 1964, after a courtship of just four months. ==Political spouse== Upon her second marriage, Maryon Pittman Allen became a political wife. As lieutenant governor, Jim Allen had to preside over the Alabama State Senate in a special session of the state legislature that Governor George C. Wallace had called three days before the wedding. In a newspaper article published shortly thereafter, she wrote that the legislative session had resulted in the couple's having \\"the most public, political honeymoon in history\\". In 1967, the same year that her husband finished his term as lieutenant governor, Maryon Allen discovered that she had tuberculosis and underwent several months of treatment. The following year she wrote a series of articles for Alabama newspapers in which she described her experiences. Her articles described the care programs in Alabama hospitals and urged readers to get tuberculin tests and chest X-rays. In 1968, Jim Allen won election to the United States Senate. When he took office in January 1969, Maryon accompanied him to Washington, D.C. She continued working as a journalist, writing a syndicated news column called \\"The Reflections of a News Hen\\" for newspapers in Alabama. The column won Alabama Press Association awards as \\"best original column\\". ==U.S. Senate== Jim Allen died suddenly on June 1, 1978, the victim of a heart attack. One week later, on June 8, 1978, Alabama Governor George Wallace appointed Maryon Allen to succeed her husband in the Senate. In the Senate, she gained assignments to two of the committees on which her husband had served, Judiciary and Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, but was unsuccessful in her effort to get appointed to the Rules and Administration Committee. She was the first woman to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee. In October 1978, she voted for a proposal to allow states that had ratified the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to rescind their ratification. At the time, 35 states had ratified the ERA, three short of the total that would be needed before March 1979 in order to add the ERA to the U.S. Constitution. The proposal to allow states to rescind their ratifications failed to win a majority, and the Senate went on to join the House in voting to give states three additional years to ratify the ERA, but no additional states ratified it, so it failed. Following her appointment to the Senate, Allen decided to become a candidate in the November 1978 special election for the remaining two years of her husband's Senate term. Governor Wallace had been expected to seek the Senate seat, but he decided not to run, making Allen the favorite to win. However, she suffered serious damage to her public image after the Washington Post published an interview she had given to reporter Sally Quinn. Quinn quoted statements by Allen that appeared critical of Governor Wallace and his wife Lurleen Wallace. Allen said that Quinn had distorted her statements, but the comments alienated many Alabamians, and some questioned her judgment in sitting for an interview with the Post, which conservatives considered to be a liberal publication. She won a plurality in the September 5, 1978, Democratic primary election, receiving 44 percent of the vote, but failed to win the outright majority that was needed to avoid a runoff. In the runoff held on September 26, she lost to State Senator Donald W. Stewart by more than 120,000 votes. Stewart went on to win the general election on November 7, and Allen left the Senate the following day. During her time in office, Maryon Allen was one of only two women in the Senate. The other woman Senator, Muriel Humphrey, had been appointed in January 1978 to fill the seat vacated by the death of her husband, Hubert Humphrey. Muriel Humphrey also left the Senate in November 1978, immediately after the election of a successor. ==Later years== After the end of her brief service in the Senate, Allen worked for a time as a columnist for The Washington Post. In later years, she returned to Alabama, where she did public relations work for an antique dealer and auction house in Birmingham. Maryon Pittman Allen died on July 23, 2018 at the age of 92. ==See also== * Women in the United States Senate ==References== ==External links== Category:1925 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Alabama Democrats Category:American members of the Churches of Christ Category:American women journalists Category:Democratic Party United States senators Category:Female United States senators Category:Journalists from Alabama Category:Journalists from Mississippi Category:Politicians from Meridian, Mississippi Category:Spouses of Alabama politicians Category:United States senators from Alabama Category:University of Alabama alumni Category:Women in Alabama politics Category:Writers from Birmingham, Alabama Category:20th-century American women politicians Category:20th-century American politicians ","title":"Maryon Pittman Allen"},{"id":"822367","text":"Roger Peyrefitte (; 17 August 1907 - 5 November 2000) was a French diplomat, writer of bestseller novels and non-fiction, and a defender of gay rights and pederasty. ==Life and work== Born in Castres, Tarn, to a middle class bourgeois family, Peyrefitte went to Jesuit and Lazarist boarding schools and then studied language and literature in the University of Toulouse. After graduating first of his year from Institut d'√âtudes Politiques de Paris in 1930, he worked as an embassy secretary in Athens between 1933 and 1938. Back in Paris, he had to resign in 1940 for personal reasons before being reintegrated in 1943 and finally ending his diplomatic career in 1945. In his novels, he often treated controversial themes and his work put him at odds with the Roman Catholic church. He wrote openly about his homoerotic experiences in boarding school in his 1943 first novel Les amiti√©s particuli√®res which won the coveted prix Renaudot in 1944. The book was made into a film of the same name which was released in 1964. On the set, Peyrefitte met the 12-year-old Alain-Philippe Malagnac d'Argens de Vill√®le;R. Peyrefitte, Propos secrets, 1977, pp. 285‚Äì289; L'Enfant de c≈ìur, 1978, pp. 9 and 29. and both fell in love. Peyrefitte tells the story of their relationship in Notre amour (\\"Our Love\\" ‚Äì 1967) and L'Enfant de c≈ìur (\\"Child of the Heart\\" ‚Äì 1978). Malagnac later married performer Amanda Lear. A cultivator of scandal, Peyrefitte attacked the Vatican and Pope Pius XII in his book Les Cl√©s de saint Pierre (1953), which earned him the nickname of \\"Pope of the Homosexuals\\". The publication of the book started a bitter quarrel with Fran√ßois Mauriac. Mauriac threatened to resign from the paper he was working with at the time, L'Express, if it did not stop carrying advertisements for the book. The quarrel was exacerbated by Mauriac's articles attacking the memory of Jean Cocteau because of his homosexuality and the release of the film adaptation of Les amiti√©s particuli√®res. This culminated in a virulent open letter by Peyrefitte in which he accused Mauriac of being a hypocrite, a fake heterosexual who maligned his own children and a closeted homosexual with a past.L'illustre √©crivain catholique It is said Mauriac was badly shaken with this letter, unable to get out of bed for a whole week. In April 1976, after Pope Paul VI had condemned pre-marital sex, masturbation and homosexuality in the encyclical Persona Humana: Declaration on Certain Questions Concerning Sexual Ethics, in a series of interviews Peyrefitte accused him of being a closet homosexual that chose his papal name after his lover's first name. Although his statements were published in a few discrete magazines, Peyrefitte was surprised and overjoyed when one day he watched in television the Pope addressing the issue in the heart of St. Peter's Square, complaining about the \\"horrible and slanderous insinuations\\" that were being said about the Holy Father and appealing for prayers on his behalf. In Les Ambassades (1951), he revealed the ins and outs of diplomacy. Peyrefitte also wrote a book full of gossip about Baron Jacques d'Adelsw√§rd-Fersen's exile in Capri (L'Exil√© de Capri, 1959) and translated Greek gay love poetry (La Muse gar√ßonni√®re (The Boyish Muse), Flammarion, 1973). In his memoirs, Propos Secrets, he wrote extensively about his youth, his sex life (pederastic mainly and a few affairs with women), his years as a diplomat, his travels to Greece and ItalyMaking such polemic statements as that the majority of Italian men were bisexual and that heterosexual anal sex was commonplace, much to the joy of Italian women and particularly as a birth control method. and his troubles with the police for sexually harassing male teenagers. He also gave vent to his fierce love of snobbish genealogizing and vitriolic well-documented gossip, writing about famous people of his time such as Andr√© Gide, Henry de Montherlant, Fran√ßois Mauriac, Andr√© Malraux, Jean Cocteau, Jean Genet, Marcel Jouhandeau, Marie-Laure de Noailles, Gaston Gallimard, Jean-Paul Sartre, Charles de Gaulle, Giscard d'Estaing, Georges Pompidou, among many others. Claiming he had reliable sources within the Vatican's \\"black aristocracy\\", once again he stated that three recent popes of the 20th century were homosexuals: Pius XII, John XXIII and Paul VI. He particularly loved to expose the hypocrisy and vanity of prominent people, to denounce fake aristocrats and to out closeted homosexuals. Roger Peyrefitte wrote popular historical biographies about Alexander the Great and Voltaire. In Voltaire et Fr√©d√©ric II he claimed that Voltaire had been the passive lover of Frederick the Great. In spite of his libertarian views on sexuality, politically Peyrefitte was a conservative bourgeois and in his later years he supported right-winger Jean- Marie Le Pen. He died of Parkinson's disease at age 93 after receiving the last rites from the Catholic Church he had attacked so constantly. == Legacy == After his death, the city of Capri dedicated a plaque to him which is mounted near Villa Lysis and the inscription of which reads: A Roger Peyrefitte autore de L'esule di Capri per aver esaltato e diffuso il mito, la cultura e la bellezza dell'isola nel mondo. -- \\"For Roger Peyrefitte, author of L'Exile de Capri, for having exalted and diffused the myth, the culture, and the beauty of this island in the world.\\" In a 2012 essay about the importance of public libraries, English actor and writer Stephen Fry mentions that Peyrefitte's novels The Exile of Capri and Special Friendships were \\"unforgettable, transformative books\\" for him. ==Press cuttings== *Obituary in The Times, 7 November 2000, page 25. \\"In the minds of many, Roger Peyrefitte's reputation as a genuinely literary novelist is based on one novel - Les Amiti√©s Particuli√®res (1944), which was also his first. He wrote many others, but none really matched the merit of the first, and the author seemed increasingly to seek a succ√®s de scandale rather than any serious critical consideration.\\" *Obituary by James Kirkup in The Independent: The Tuesday Review, 7 November 2000, page 6. \\"Peyrefitte was a skilled manipulator of the media. He was charismatic to the point of absurdity, with his dramatic gestures and outrageous behaviour, so that in the end no one took any notice of his often ludicrous fabrications, though they were always delivered with great style and conviction, and with an effrontery that was amusingly malicious. {...} Peyrefitte acknowledges the courage of his great predecessors Andr√© Gide, Marcel Proust, Jean Cocteau and Oscar Wilde, while regretting the timidity of Marcel Jouhandeau and many of the contemporary French writers, whether gay or straight, in pursuing the cause of homosexual (and heterosexual) rights.\\" *Obituary by Douglas Johnson in The Guardian, 15 November 2000, page 24. \\"Andr√© Gide, who had attempted to defend homosexuality in a much earlier work, was prophetic in his congratulations to Peyrefitte. He did not think that Les Amiti√©s Particuli√®res would win the Goncourt prize, but he did believe it would still be read a century later.\\" ==Bibliography== *Les Amiti√©s particuli√®res, novel, Editions Flammarion 1944 (English translations as Special Friendships by Felix Giovanelli 1950 & Edward Hyams 1958: ) *Mademoiselle de Murville, novel, Editions Jean Vigneau 1947 *Le Prince des neiges, drama in 3 acts, Editions Jean Vigneau 1947 *L'Oracle, novel, Editions Jean Vigneau 1948 (definitive edition 1974) *Les Amours singuli√®res, novel, Editions Jean Vigneau 1949 *La Mort d'une m√®re, Editions Flammarion 1950 *Les Ambassades, novel, Editions Flammarion 1951 (English translation 1953 by James FitzMaurice as Diplomatic Diversions: ) *Les ≈íuvres libres - Roger Peyrefitte, etc. Editions Arth√®me Fayard 1951 *Du V√©suve √† l'Etna, travelogue, Editions Flammarion 1952 (English translation 1954 by John McEwen as South from Naples) *La Fin des ambassades, novel, Editions Flammarion 1953 (English translation 1954 by Edward Hyams as Diplomatic Conclusions: ) *Les Amours, de Lucien de Samosate (translation of the original Greek), Editions Flammarion 1954 *Les Cl√©s de saint Pierre, novel, Editions Flammarion 1955 (English translation 1957 by Edward Hyams as The Keys of St. Peter) *Jeunes Proies, Editions Flammarion 1956 *Les Chevaliers de Malte, Editions Flammarion 1957 (English translation: ) *L'Exil√© de Capri, Editions Flammarion 1959 (English translation 1961 by Edward Hyams as The Exile of Capri) *Le Spectateur nocturne, dramatic dialogue, Editions Flammarion 1960 *Les Fils de la lumi√®re, study of Free-Masonry, Editions Flammarion 1961 *La Nature du Prince, Editions Flammarion 1963 *Les Secrets des conclaves, Editions Flammarion 1964 *Les Juifs, Editions Flammarion 1965 (English translation: ) *Notre Amour, Editions Flammarion 1967 *Les Am√©ricains, novel, Editions Flammarion 1968 *Des Fran√ßais, novel, Editions Flammarion 1970 *La Coloquinte, novel, Editions Flammarion 1971 *Manouche, biography of Germaine Germain, Editions Flammarion 1972 (English translations as Manouche by Derek Coltman 1973 & Sam Flores 1974: ) *L'Enfant Amour, essay, Editions Flammarion 1972 *Un Mus√©e de l'Amour, photographs of his collection of pederastic art by Marianne Haas, Editions du Rocher 1972 *La Muse Gar√ßonni√®re, (Musa Paidika) translated of the original Greek, Editions Flammarion 1973 *Tableaux de chasse, ou la vie extraordinaire de Fernand Legros, Editions Albin Michel 1976 *Propos secrets, memoirs, Editions Albin Michel 1977 *Trilogy about Alexander the Great - Editions Albin Michel *#La Jeunesse d'Alexandre, 1977 *#Les Conqu√™tes d'Alexandre, 1979 *#Alexandre le Grand, 1981 *Propos secrets 2, memoirs, Editions Albin Michel 1980 *L'Enfant de c≈ìur, Editions Albin Michel 1978 *Roy, novel, Editions Albin Michel 1979 *L'Illustre √©crivain, Editions Albin Michel 1982 *', presentation and notes by R.

Families gathered to dine together and offer food and incense to the Lares as their household gods.Michele Renee Salzman, \\"Religious Koine and Religious Dissent in the Fourth Century,\\" A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 115; Ittai Gradel, Emperor Worship and Roman Religion (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 208. It was a day of reconciliation when disagreements were to be set aside, but the poet Ovid observes satirically that this could be achieved only by excluding family members who caused trouble.Ovid, Fasti 2.623‚Äì626, 631‚Äì632; William Warde Fowler, The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic (London, 1908), p. 418. ==Activities and context== The Caristia was one of several days in February that honored family or ancestors. It followed the Parentalia, nine days of remembrance which began on February 13 and concluded with the Feralia on February 21, or in the view of some, the Caristia on the next day. For the Parentalia, families visited the tombs of their ancestors and shared cake and wine both in the form of offerings and as a meal among themselves. The Feralia was a more somber occasion, a public festival of sacrifices and offerings to the Manes, the spirits of the dead who required propitiation.Salzman, \\"Religious Koine,\\" p. 115. The Caristia was a recognition of the family line as it continued into the present and among the living.Fowler, Religious Experience p. 418. There were distributions of bread, wine, and sportulae (bonuses, tips, tokens of appreciation).John F. Donahue, \\"Towards a Typology of Roman Public Feasting,\\" in Roman Dining: A Special Issue of American Journal of Philology (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005), p. 105. The poet Martial has a pair of poems on gift-giving for the holiday; in one, he offers a sort of \\"non-apology apology\\" to his relatives Stella and Flaccus, explaining that he's sent them nothing because he didn't want to offend others who ought to receive a gift from him and wouldn't.Martial, Epigrams 9.54 and 55; Ruurd R. Nauta, Poetry for Patrons: Literary Communication in the Age of Domitian (Brill, 2002), p. 79. ==On the calendar== Unlike public festivals, the Caristia and other privately observed holidays were allowed to fall on even-numbered days of the Roman calendar.Michael Lipka, Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach (Brill, 2009), p. 46. The Cara Cognatio remained on the calendar long after the Roman Empire had come under Christian rule. It appeared in the Chronography of 354, and the calendar of Polemius Silvius (449 AD) juxtaposed the old holiday with a feast day commemorating the burial of St. Peter and St. Paul.Robert Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome (Routledge, 1998, 2001), p. 164. As a \\"love feast,\\" the Caristia was not incompatible with Christian attitudes;Fowler, Religious Experience p. 457. some scholars have detected an influence of the Parentalia and Caristia on the Christian agape feast, with the consumption of bread and wine at the ancestral tomb replaced by the Eucharist.Bonnie Effros, Creating Community with Food and Drink in Merovingian Gaul (Palgrave Macmillan, 2002), p. 74. In the 5th century, some Christian priests even encouraged participation in funerary meals.Effros, Creating Community, p. 76. In the first half of the 6th century, some Gallo- Romans still observed a form of the holiday with food offerings to the dead and a ritual meal.Bernadotte Filotas, Pagan Survivals, Superstitions and Popular Cultures in Early Medieval Pastoral Literature (Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 2005), pp. 172‚Äì173, citing Concilium Turonense (567) 23, CCSL 148A: 191‚Äì192. By then, however, the practice had come under suspicion as a \\"pagan\\" ritual, and the Council of Tours in 567 explicitly censured those who \\"defiled\\" the feast day of St. Peter. The observances were condemned by Caesarius of Arles as an excuse for drunkenness, dancing, singing, and other demonic behaviors. The suppression of traditional commemorations of the dead were part of increasing efforts by the Church to control and monopolize religious behaviors in Merovingian Gaul.Effros, Creating Community, pp. 74‚Äì78, especially pp. 75‚Äì76. ==References== Category:Ancient Roman festivals Category:Ancient Roman families Category:February observances ","title":"Caristia"},{"id":"822439","text":"Feretrius is one of the titles of the Roman god Jupiter.

The bishops in U.S. insular areas in the Pacific Ocean the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Territory of American Samoa, and the Territory of Guam are members of the Episcopal Conference of the Pacific. The USCCB adopted its current name in July 2001. The organization is a registered corporation based in Washington, D.C. As with all bishops' conferences, certain decisions and acts of the USCCB must receive the recognitio, or approval, of the Roman dicasteries, which are subject to the immediate and absolute authority of the Pope. , the president is Jos√© Horacio G√≥mez, the archbishop of Los Angeles. The vice-president is Allen Henry Vigneron, archbishop of Detroit. ==History== The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops took its present form in 2001 from the consolidation of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the United States Catholic Conference. The USCCB traces its origins to the National Catholic War Council, which was founded in 1917. ===National Catholic War Council=== The first national organization of Catholic bishops in the United States was founded in 1917 as the National Catholic War Council (NCWC), formed to enable U.S. Catholics to contribute funds for the spiritual care of Catholic servicemen during World War I. ===National Catholic Welfare Council=== In 1919 Pope Benedict XV urged the college of bishops around the world to assist him in promoting the labor reforms first articulated by Pope Leo XIII in Rerum novarum. In response, the U.S. Catholic episcopate organized the National Catholic Welfare Council in 1919. They also created the first Administrative Committee of seven members to manage daily affairs between plenary meetings, with archbishop Edward Joseph Hanna of San Francisco as the first chairman. Headquarters were established in Washington, D.C. After a threatened suppression of the National Catholic Welfare Council, the administrative board decided to rename the organization to be the National Catholic Welfare Conference, with the purpose of advocating reforms in education, immigration, and social action. ===NCCB/USCC=== Episcopal conferences were first established as formal bodies by the Second Vatican Council (Christus Dominus, 38), and implemented by Pope Paul VI's 1966 motu proprio Ecclesiae sanctae. In order to fulfill the new requirements for national conferences of bishops, the American bishops established in 1966the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB) and its secular arm, the United States Catholic Conference (USCC). As separate organizations with distinct responsibilities, the NCCB focused on internal ecclesiastical concerns while the USCC carried forward work in society at large. The NCCB enabled the bishops to deliberate and respond collectively on a broad range of issues, with work being carried out through various secretariats, standing committees, and ad hoc committees. On July 1, 2001, the NCCB and the USCC were combined to form the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). The merger resulted in the continuation of all of the work formerly done by the NCCB and the USCC, with the same staff. The operation, authority, and responsibilities of episcopal conferences are currently governed by the 1983 Code of Canon Law (see especially canons 447‚Äì459). The nature of episcopal conferences, and their magisterial authority in particular, was subsequently clarified by Pope John Paul II's 1998 motu proprio, Apostolos suos. ===Current structure and membership=== The structure of the conference (USCCB) consists of 16 standing committees (whose members are bishops) and the departments, secretariats, and offices that carry out the work of the committees. The leaders of these departments, secretariats, and offices report to the general secretariat of the conference. USCCB offices in Washington, D.C. The membership of the USCCB consists of all active and retired Latin Church Catholic and Eastern Catholic bishops (i.e., diocesan, coadjutor, and auxiliary bishops) of the United States and the Territory of the Virgin Islands and the ordinary of the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter but not the bishops of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Territory of American Samoa, and the Territory of Guam. The bishops of the latter four U.S. overseas dependencies belong to other episcopal conferences. In the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the bishops in the six dioceses form their own episcopal conference, the Puerto Rican Episcopal Conference. The bishops in U.S. insular areas in the Pacific Ocean the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Territory of American Samoa, and the Territory of Guam are members of the Episcopal Conference of the Pacific. The USCCB has two semiannual meetings, in November and June. Between these meetings, the conference is governed by the Administrative Committee. There is also an executive committee, whose members include the conference president, vice- president, and secretary (all of whom are bishops). The officers of the conference are elected for three-year terms. The conference also elects chairmen and chairmen-elect of the standing committees. ==Regions== The USCCB divides the Latin Church dioceses of the United States into fourteen geographical regions, while a fifteenth region consists of the Eastern Catholic eparchies and exarchate. The dioceses of the United States are grouped into fifteen regions. Fourteen of the regions (numbered I through XIV) are geographically based, for the Latin Catholic dioceses. The Eastern Catholic eparchies (dioceses) constitute Region XV. ; ==InitiativesNational Right to Life Committee (1968‚Äì1973)=== The National Conference of Catholic Bishops had appointed James T. McHugh during April 1967 to lead the early formation of what was later to become the National Right to Life Committee. The NRLC was itself formed in 1968 under the auspices of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops to coordinate information and strategy between developing local and state Catholic pro-life groups and is the oldest and the largest national organization against legal abortion in the United States with NRLC affiliates in all 50 states and over 3,000 local chapters nationwide.http://www.christianlifeandliberty.net/RTL.bmp K.M. Cassidy. \\"Right to Life.\\" In Dictionary of Christianity in America, Coordinating Editor, Daniel G. Reid. Downers Grove, Illinois: InterVarsity Press, 1990. pp. 1017,1018. These NRLC affiliate groups were forming in response to efforts to change abortion laws based on model legislation proposed by the American Law Institute (ALI). New Jersey attorney Juan Ryan served as the organization's first president. NRLC held a nationwide meeting of pro-life leaders in Chicago in 1970 at Barat College. The following year, NRLC held its first convention at Macalestar College in St. Paul, Minnesota. === Health care === The USCCB are issuing the \\"Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services\\" that have in some cases caused doctors to refuse treatment of patients although in an emergency situation. In March 2012, regarding the federal requirement that employers who do not support contraception but are not religious institutions per se must cover contraception via health insurance, USCCB decided to \\"continue its 'vigorous opposition to this unjust and illegal mandate'\\".Meehan, Seth, \\"Catholics and Contraception: Boston, 1965\\", The New York Times, March 15, 2012. Retrieved 2012-03-15. In June and July 2012, the USCCB promoted a campaign of events called the Fortnight for Freedom to protest government activities that in their view impinged on their religious liberty. ===Immigration=== The USCCB platform on immigration reform includes:United States Conference of Catholic Bishops: \\"Catholic Church's Position on Immigration Reform\\" August 2013Pittsburgh Tribune: \\"Catholic Bishop Zubik prays for immigration reform\\" By Matthew Santoni November 24, 2013 *Earned legalization for immigrants who are of good moral character to adjust their status to obtain lawful permanent residence after a background check and payment of fines. *A legal path for foreign born workers to enter the U.S. for work in order to alleviate border crossing deaths. *More visas to promote family reunification as well as a reduction in waiting times. *Elimination of some of the penalties in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 such as the three year and ten year bans on deported illegal immigrants (depending on the length of their illegal stay in the U.S.) *The root cause of illegal immigrations such as poverty and inequality in sending countries needs to be addressed. *Enforcement should focus on illegal immigrants who pose risks to public safety rather than on families seeking employment. ===National Pastoral Initiative for Marriage=== In November 2004, the USCCB kicked off the National Pastoral Initiative for Marriage, a multi-year effort to promote traditional marriage values. The National Pastoral Initiative for Marriage is a multi-year, far-reaching effort to promote traditional marriage values created by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops in 2004. Led by Archbishop Joseph Edward Kurtz of Louisville, and the USCCB's Office of Laity, Marriage, Family Life and Youth, as well as the Catholic Communication Campaign, the Initiative synthesizes social-science research, Catholic teaching and pastoral practice, and the everyday experiences of married men and women to bolster marriage as a social institution and Christian sacrament. The NPIM has largely been promoted among the general public in the United States through radio and television public- service announcements. In the advertising, couples speak candidly about the everyday things done for each other to show love and commitment as they answer the question: ‚ÄúWhat have you done for your marriage today?‚Äù Viewers are then directed to visit, an online repository of resources, tips and stories that can help strengthen a marriage. The NPIM is expected to run through 2011, with the next phase including a bishops‚Äô pastoral letter. === Religious liberty === On September 29, 2011, the archbishop of New York, Timothy M. Dolan, then president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), appointed Archbishop William E. Lori the chair of a newly formed Ad Hoc Committee for Religious Liberty to address growing concerns over the erosion of freedom of religion in America. During June 2017, the U.S. bishops voted to establish a permanent Committee for Religious Liberty. The USCCB Office of Religious Liberty is currently led by Archbishop Joseph Edward Kurtz, who also was president of the USCCB during 2013-2016. Religious Freedom Week is held annually during early summer to coincide approximately with U.S. Independence Day on July 4 and with the June 22 Feast of Saints Thomas More and John Fisher. === LGBT rights === On June 12, 2020, a committee praised President Donald Trump's administration for changing a Department of Health and Human Services ruling regarding discrimination based on gender identity, saying it \\"will help restore the rights of health care providers‚Äîas well as insurers and employers‚Äîwho decline to perform or cover abortions or 'gender transition' procedures due to ethical or professional objections.\\" As president of the USCCB, Archbishop Jos√© G√≥mez criticized the U.S. Supreme Court after the ruling on Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, and other cases regarding LGBTQ+ employment discrimination. The ruling read Civil Rights Act of 1964 as prohibiting discrimination on sexual orientation. G√≥mez said, \\"This is an injustice that will have implications in many areas of life.\\"http://usccb.org/news/2020/20-93.cfm ==Presidents== #‚Ä† John F.

They are also known as Arecuna, Aricuna Jaricuna, Kamarakoto, and Taurepang. ==People== The Pemon are part of the larger Cariban language family, and include six groups including the Arekuna, Ingarik√≥, Kamarakoto, Tualipang, Mapoyo and Macushi/Makushi (Macuxi or Makuxi in Brazil). While ethnographic data on these groups are scant, Iris Myers produced one of the most detailed accounts of the Makushi in the 1940s, and her work is heavily relied upon for comparisons between historical and contemporary Makushi life. The Pemon were first encountered by westerners in the 18th century and converted by missionaries to Christianity. Their society is based on trade and considered egalitarian and decentralized, and in Venezuela, funding from petrodollars have helped fund community projects, and ecotourism opportunities are also being developed. In Venezuela, Pemon live in the Gran Sabana grassland plateau dotted with tabletop mountains where the Angel Falls, the world's highest waterfall, plunges from Auyantepui in Canaima National Park. The Makuxi, who are also Pemon speakers, are found in Brazil and Guyana in areas close to the Venezuelan border. ==Language== Arekuna, or Pemon (in Spanish: Pem√≥n), is a Cariban language spoken mainly in Venezuela, specifically in the Gran Sabana region of Bol√≠var State. According to the 2001 census there were 15,094 Pemon speakers in Venezuela. == Myths == Three Pemon youths The Pemon have a very rich mythic tradition which is merged into their present Christian faiths. Pemon mythology includes gods residing in the grassland area's table-top mountains called tepui. The mountains are off- limits to the living, as they are also home to ancestor spirits called mawari. The first non-native person to seriously study Pemon myths and language was the German ethnologist Theodor Koch-Grunberg, who visited Roraima in 1912. Important myths describe the origins of the sun and moon, the creation of the tepui mountains ‚Äì which dramatically rise from the savannahs of the Gran Sabana ‚Äî and the activities of the creator hero Makunaima and his brothers. ==\\"Kueka\\" stone controversy== In 1999, Wolfgang Kraker von Schwarzenfeld arranged the transport of a red stone boulder, weighing about 35 metric tons, from Venezuela's Canaima National Park to Berlin Tiergarten for his \\"global stone\\" project.

He studied at the universities of Rostock,See entry of Valentinus Acedalius in Rostock Matrikelportal Greifswald and Helmstedt. Even in his early youth, his Latin poems caused a stir. In 1590 he accompanied his friend Daniel Bucretius (Daniel Rindfleisch) to Italy where he published his first literary work, an edition of Velleius Paterculus. Acidalius studied philosophy and medicine in Bologna and was awarded a doctorate degree in both disciplines. He was however not attracted by the practical work as a medic and therefore concentrated on the criticism of classic works. He returned to Germany in 1593 after several fever attacks, moving to Breslau, the home town of his friend Bucretius. In 1595 Acidalius became a Catholic and in spring of the same year, he accepted an invitation of his friend and supporter, the episcopal chancellor Wacker von Wackenfels to Neisse. He died there of a fever at the age of 28. ==Publications== * Velleius Paterculus, 1590, Padua * Animadversiones in Curtium, 1594, Frankfurt Posthumously: * a collection of poems, elegies, odes and epigrams, 1603, Liegnitz * Centuria prima epistolarum, 1606, Hanau * Divinationes et interpretationes in comoedias Plauti, 1607, Frankfurt, 566 pages * Notae in Taciti opera, 1607, Hannover * Notae in Panegyrici veteres, 1607, Heidelberg Disputed: * Disputatio nova contra mulieres, qua probatur eas homines non esse, 1595, probably printed in Zerbst, 11 sheets 4¬∞.

In particular, biogeochemistry is the study of the cycles of chemical elements, such as carbon and nitrogen, and their interactions with and incorporation into living things transported through earth scale biological systems in space through time. The field focuses on chemical cycles which are either driven by or influence biological activity. Particular emphasis is placed on the study of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, iron, and phosphorus cycles. Biogeochemistry is a systems science closely related to systems ecology. ==History== Vladimir Vernadsky The founder of biogeochemistry was Russian and Ukrainian scientist Vladimir Vernadsky whose 1926 book The Biosphere,Vladimir I. Vernadsky, 2007, Essays on Geochemistry & the Biosphere, tr. Olga Barash, Santa Fe, NM, Synergetic Press, (originally published in Russian in 1924) in the tradition of Mendeleev, formulated a physics of the Earth as a living whole. Vernadsky distinguished three spheres, where a sphere was a concept similar to the concept of a phase-space. He observed that each sphere had its own laws of evolution, and that the higher spheres modified and dominated the lower: # Abiotic sphere ‚Äì all the non-living energy and material processes # Biosphere ‚Äì the life processes that live within the abiotic sphere # N√∂esis or noosphere ‚Äì the sphere of human cognitive process Human activities (e.g., agriculture and industry) modify the biosphere and abiotic sphere. In the contemporary environment, the amount of influence humans have on the other two spheres is comparable to a geological force (see Anthropocene). ==Early development== The American limnologist and geochemist G. Evelyn Hutchinson is credited with outlining the broad scope and principles of this new field. More recently, the basic elements of the discipline of biogeochemistry were restated and popularized by the British scientist and writer, James Lovelock, under the label of the Gaia Hypothesis. Lovelock emphasizes a concept that life processes regulate the Earth through feedback mechanisms to keep it habitable. ==Research== There are biogeochemistry research groups in many universities around the world. Since this is a highly inter-disciplinary field, these are situated within a wide range of host disciplines including: atmospheric sciences, biology, ecology, geomicrobiology, environmental chemistry, geology, oceanography and soil science. These are often bracketed into larger disciplines such as earth science and environmental science. Many researchers investigate the biogeochemical cycles of chemical elements such as carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur, as well as their stable isotopes. The cycles of trace elements such as the trace metals and the radionuclides are also studied. This research has obvious applications in the exploration for ore deposits and oil, and in remediation of environmental pollution. Some important research fields for biogeochemistry include: * modelling of natural systems * soil and water acidification recovery processes * eutrophication of surface waters * carbon sequestration * Environmental remediation * global change * climate change * biogeochemical prospecting for ore deposits * Soil chemistry ==See also== * Acid rain * Atlantic Data Base of Exchange Processes at the Deep Sea Floor * Carbon sink * Ecosystem model * Edaphology * Environmental engineering science * Geochemistry * Geophysiology * GEOTRACES * Hydrogen isotope biogeochemistry * IMBER * Marine biogeochemical cycles * Pedology (soil study) * Physical impacts of climate change ==References Citations === ==Representative books and publications== * Vladimir I.

It is also marketed in many European countries for the indication of major depression under the trade names Cincofarm, Levothym, Levotonine, Oxyfan, Telesol, Tript-OH, and Triptum. A 2002 review concluded that although the data evaluated suggests that 5-HTP is more effective than placebo in the treatment of depression, the evidence was insufficient to be conclusive due to a lack of clinical data meeting the rigorous standards of the day. More and larger studies using current methodologies are needed to determine if 5-HTP is truly effective in treating depression.5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) University of Maryland Medical Center. 2011. Accessed: 9 January 2012. In small controlled trials 5-HTP has also been reported to augment the antidepressant efficacy of the antidepressant clomipramine. 5-HTP is sometimes taken by people coming down from MDMA to relieve post-MDMA dysphoria. As 5-HTP is a necessary precursor for the brain to produce more serotonin, and MDMA use depletes a person's natural serotonin levels, it is believed that taking 5-HTP after consuming MDMA will speed up serotonin production. DanceSafe claims that the anecdotal evidence is widespread and that the theory is physiologically reasonable. Backing up this approach is research conducted by Wang, et al. in 2007, which observed that MDMA-induced depletions of 5-HT (serotonin) were restored in rats after administration of 5-HTP, and suggested that this approach might be clinically useful in abstinent MDMA users. At high doses, or in combination with carbidopa, it has been used off-label to treat obesity (by promoting weight loss). In clinical trials of various design, 5-HTP has also been reported to treat fibromyalgia, myoclonus, migraine, and cerebellar ataxia. However, these clinical findings, as for all therapeutic findings with 5-HTP, are preliminary and need confirmation in larger trials. == 5-HTP's drawbacks as a drug == The short half-life (<2h) of 5-HTP may inherently limit the therapeutic potential of 5-HTP, as the systemic 5-HTP exposure levels will fluctuate substantially, even with relatively frequent dosing. Such exposure fluctuations are usually associated with increased adverse event burden, resulting from Cmax drug spikes, and decreased clinical efficacy resulting from sub-therapeutic exposure for large parts of the day. It has been proposed that 5-HTP dosage forms achieving prolonged delivery would be more effective, as is general with short-acting active pharmaceutical ingredients. Unexpectedly, 5-HTP was found to be essential for the growth of human parainfluenza virus in cell culture.Rabbani M A G, Barik S (2017) \\"5-Hydroxytryptophan, a major product of tryptophan degradation, is essential for optimal replication of human parainfluenza virus\\". Virology 503: 46-51. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2017.01.007. PMCID: PMC5478882 ==Side effects== Potential side effects of 5-HTP include heartburn, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, drowsiness, sexual problems, vivid dreams or nightmares, and muscle problems. Because 5-HTP has not been thoroughly studied in a clinical setting, possible side effects and interactions with other drugs are not well known. According to the US National Institute of Health TOXNET, 5-HTP has not been associated with serotonin syndrome or any serious adverse events in humans. Across multiple studies, 5-HTP has also been reported to not cause any noticeable hematological or cardiovascular changes. 5-HTP has also been associated with eosinophilia, but later studies have not found any causal connection. == Interactions == When combined with antidepressants of the MAOI or SSRI class, very high parenteral doses of 5-HTP can cause acute serotonin syndrome in rats. It is unclear if such findings have clinical relevance, as most drugs will cause serious adverse events or death in rodents at very high doses. In humans 5-HTP has never been clinically associated with serotonin syndrome, although a case report suggests 5-HTP can precipitate mania when added to an MAOI. When combined with carbidopa (as a treatment for symptoms of Parkinson's disease), 5-HTP causes nausea and vomiting; however this can be alleviated via administration of granisetron. As mentioned below under pharmacology, cases of scleroderma-like illness have been reported in patients using carbidopa and 5-HTP. Oral 5-HTP results in an increase in urinary 5-HIAA, a serotonin metabolite, indicating that 5-HTP is peripherally metabolized to serotonin, which is then metabolized. This might cause a false positive test in tests looking for carcinoid syndrome. Due to the conversion of 5-HTP into serotonin by the liver, there could be a risk of heart valve disease from serotonin's effect on the heart, as based on preclinical findings. However, 5-HTP has not been associated with cardiac toxicity in humans. It has been suggested that 5-HTP may cause eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS), a serious condition which results in extreme muscle tenderness, myalgia, and blood abnormalities. However, there is evidence to show that EMS was likely caused by a contaminant in certain 5-HTP supplements. == Production == 5-HTP is produced from the amino acid tryptophan through the action of the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase. Tryptophan hydroxylase is one of the biopterin-dependent aromatic amino acid hydroxylases. Production of 5-HTP is the rate-limiting step in 5-HT synthesis. 5-HTP is normally rapidly converted to 5-HT by amino acid decarboxylase. == Absorption == After oral administration, 5-HTP is absorbed by the upper intestine. The mode of absorption is not known, but presumably involves active transport via amino acid transporters. 5-HTP is adequately absorbed via oral cavity. With a decarboxylase inhibitor, the bioavailability of 5-HTP can be higher than 50%. == Pharmacokinetics == 5-HTP is rapidly absorbed with Tmax of ~1.5h, and rapidly eliminated with a half-life of ~1.5-2h. Co-administration of a decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g. carbidopa, benserazide) doubles the half- life of 5-HTP, to 3-4h, and enhances exposure several fold, depending on the dosing regimen. == Metabolism == 5-HTP is decarboxylated to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) by the enzyme aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase with the help of vitamin B6. This reaction occurs both in nervous tissue and in the liver. 5-HTP crosses the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, while 5-HT does not. Excess 5-HTP, especially when administered with vitamin B6, is thought to be metabolized and excreted. == Pharmacology == The psychoactive action of 5-HTP is derived from its increase in production of serotonin in central nervous system tissue. Metabolic pathway from tryptophan to serotonin. Research shows that co-administration with carbidopa greatly increases plasma 5-HTP levels. Other studies have indicated the risk of a scleroderma-like condition resulting from the combination of 5-HTP and carbidopa. == Regulatory Status == There are currently no approved drug products containing 5-HTP approved by the FDA. All available 5-HTP products are nutraceuticals and are as such not regulated or verified for purity, integrity, or clinical efficacy or safety, mandating caution regarding human consumption. == 5-HTP Slow- Release == 5-HTP's fast-in, fast-out pharmacokinetics is impractical for chronic drug therapy. Research conducted at Duke University in mice have demonstrated that 5-HTP when administered as slow-release appears to gain drug properties. Slow-Release delivery attenuates or abolishes the peaks and valleys in 5-HTP exposure during treatment. Slow-release delivery of 5-HTP markedly improved the safety profile of 5-HTP and conferred stable plasma exposure of 5-HTP and strong and sustained enhancement of brain serotonin function. This discovery indicates that 5-HTP slow-release medications represent a new avenue for treatment of brain disorders responsive to serotonergic enhancement. == Dietary sources == Though 5-HTP is found in food only in insignificant quantities, it is a chemical involved intermediately in the metabolism of tryptophan, an amino acid found in all unfractionated foods, with lower total amino acid content correlating with increased tryptophan absorption. The seeds of the Griffonia simplicifolia, a climbing shrub native to West Africa and Central Africa, are used as an herbal supplement for their 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) content.

The synagogue was built in response to an increase in the Jewish population in the old Galata neighborhood (today encompassed by Beyoƒülu district) in the late 1930s. A Jewish primary school was torn down in 1949 for that purpose and the synagogue was built on its ruins. The construction completed in 1951.

He painted the impressive altar in the St. Leonhard cemetery Chapel in Ehingen (Donau)-Risstissen, Germany which bears his inscription Jacob acker maler zu ulm hat diese dafel gemacht uf des hailligen Kreutz tag an herst. anno dmi MCCCCLXXXIII jar. This means: \\"Jacob Acker, painter in Ulm has completed this painting on the day of the holy cross in the year of 1483\\". Not much is known about this Jacob Acker \\"der J√ºngere\\" (the younger). Most probably he belonged to the extended Ulm artist family of the Acker, many of them members of the so-called \\"Ulmer Schule\\" (school of Ulm). This dynasty of artists started with Jakob Acker \\"dem √Ñlteren\\" (the elder), who lived around 1400. He painted some of the surviving stained glass windows of Ulm Minster. His son Hans Acker (about 1380-1461) continued with this profession and his stained glass windows can also still be admired in Ulm Minster. Whether Jacob Acker \\"der Juengere\\" is a son or brother of Hans Acker is not known. Jakob Acker the Younger produced painted doors for the main pipe organ of Ulm Minster. This organ and Jakob Acker's doors are lost. In 1529 Ulm converted to Protestantism; under the radical influence of the reformer Zwingli on the so- called \\"G√∂tzentag\\", the people of Ulm burned most of the paintings, altars, and organs of Ulm Minster in a huge fire on the square in front of the church in summer 1531. The Germans called this fundamentalist Protestant religious movement \\"die Bilderst√ºrmer\\" (iconoclasts). Because Risstissen, some 12 miles southwest of Ulm, then only partially owned by the city of Ulm remained Roman Catholic, Jakob Acker's remarkable Risstissen altar survived. It is believed to have been part of the decoration of the then Gothic main church of Risstissen, which was removed at the end of the 18th century and replaced with the present church. ==References== *Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie - online version Category:15th-century German painters Category:German male painters ","title":"Jacob Acker"},{"id":"822643","text":"The Canteen Stores Department, (CSD), is a solely owned Government of India Enterprise under Ministry of Defence and has its depot in all major military bases operated by the Indian Armed Forces. CSD are the most profitable retail chain in India, ahead of Future & Reliance Retail and sell a wide variety of products like household provisions, kitchen appliances, alcoholic drinks, cars, and sports equipment. Though originally meant exclusively for active and retired members of the Armed Forces personnel (defined as troops), it is slowly and steadily being expanded to include GREF, NCC Units at Group HQ level, TA units, CDA's staff, Indian Ordnance Factories, Embarkation HQs, civilians paid from defence estimates, civilians paid out of civil estimates, and Paramilitary forces under operational/administrative control of the Army civilian government employees. Generally, these goods are procured by CSD in bulk, and sold at concessional rates (without taxes), compared with retail prices. CSD prices are low as the goods sold are exempt from taxes. A huge profit is earned by the Canteen Stores Department.http://www.google.co.in/#hl=en&source;=hp&biw;=1020&bih;=541&q;=www.csdindia.gov.in&btnG;=Google+Search&aq;=1&aqi;=g3&aql;=&oq;=www.csdindia&fp;=fdaaf9dac29f4003 Business practices of CSD have evolved over the years and are based on profitability and commercial exploitations. The development of these practices have always kept the objective of the organization in view. The department procures consumer goods and consumer-durable products in bulk directly from suppliers and positions them at 33 Area Depots (acting as wholesale depots), spread all over the country, for meeting the requirements of over 3500 URCs which function as retail outlets. Many of the URCs are located in remote/inaccessible parts of the country. ==History== The Canteen Stores Department traces its origins to the British Raj, when the Army Canteen Board was established in India as an offshoot of the Navy and the Army Canteen Board in the United Kingdom. Although the Navy and the Army Canteen Board was abolished in the UK in 1922, and was replaced by the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (NAAFI), its counterpart in India continued to function until 1927. The Army Canteen Board in India was established mainly to provide canteen facilities to British troops in India through grocery shops and bars run by canteen contractors. The Army Canteen Board was liquidated in 1927, and replaced by the Canteen Contractors' Syndicate (CCS). It was floated in the form of a limited company, under government control with its registration office at Karachi (present-day Pakistan). This company started off with a paid-up capital of , and the shareholding was confined to the canteen contractors. The CCS functioned with reasonable efficiency until the commencement of World War II. However, after the heavy buildup of the British troops in India, the CCS could no longer cope-up with the situation. Therefore, on 1 July 1942, the Government of India made use of the specific provision in Services (India) under the Directorate of Wholesale Trade and Indian Canteen Corps to handle the retail trade in operational areas. Canteen suppliers poured in from abroad and the organization functioned extremely well during the War. By 31 March 1946, it was not only able to pay back to the government the assignments of funds made available to it but could also function on its own trading capital. However, with the end of the war and homeward movement of the British troops, the import facilities dwindled and the turnover of the organization shrank. With the pulling out of troops from the operational areas, the Indian Canteen Corps was disbanded and the staff retrenched. This was closely followed by the independence and partition of the country, and the wartime organization gave birth to two Canteen Stores Departments, i.e., CSD (India) and CSD (Pakistan). The Pakistani CSD would later bifurcate further to form CSD (Bangladesh), after the independence of Bangladesh. The retail trade, however, reverted to the contractors. A board of Liquidation was formed to oversee the liquidation of assets of the war-time organization which ceased to function from 31 December 1947. The Canteen Stores Department, the present organization, thus took birth on 1 January 1948 with a working capital of assigned to it from assets of its predecessor wartime organization. The Government of India had granted the organization a life of three years on experimental basis. The situation was reviewed in 1950 and the Department was accepted as a government undertaking on a permanent basis. ==See also== * Ministry of Defence (India) ==References== ==External links== * Canteen Stores Department India Category:Military of India Category:Retailing in India Category:Indian companies established in 1948 Category:Retail companies established in 1948 Category:Military life Category:Military pay and benefits ","title":"Canteen Stores Department (India)"},{"id":"822665","text":"Cefn Sidan beach Cefn Sidan, translated from Welsh, means \\"silky ridge\\". This long sandy beach and its dunes form the outer edge of the Pembrey Burrows between Burry Port and Kidwelly, facing southwestwards over Carmarthen Bay in South Wales. Cefn Sidan beach is backed by dunes, salt marshes, Pembrey Forest and the Pembrey Country Park. ==Geography== Pembrey beach stretches for nearly eight miles from the coastal town of Burry Port to Tywyn Point at the mouth of the Gwendraeth estuary near Kidwelly. The sand has small grains and the beach is backed by dunes of windblown sand. There are sand bars projecting as shoals into Carmarthen Bay at either end of the beach. The beach has a life guard patrolling during the summer months and can be accessed by ten approach routes where notices provide information for visitors. Pembrey Forest, the Saltings nature reserve and Pembrey Country Park are inland from the beach, and RAF Pembrey is also sited here. ==Wrecks== The SV Paul on Cefn Sidan in 1925 The sands were treacherous to sailing ships and a number of vessels were certainly lost around Pembrey, including \\"La Jeune Emma\\" bound from the West Indies to France and blown badly off course in 1828. 13 of the 19 on board drowned, including Adeline Coquelin, the 12-year-old niece of Napoleon Bonaparte's divorced wife Josephine de Beauharnais.Edmund Burke, 'Annual Register of World Events' Vol. 70, 1829, p. 266.

Sleepers often use a duvet without a top bed sheet, as the duvet cover can readily be removed and laundered as often as the bottom sheet. Duvets originated in rural Europe and were filled with the down feathers of ducks or geese. The best quality is taken from the eider duck, known for its effectiveness as a thermal insulator. In Australian English, a duvet is also called a doona. In American English, it may be called a comforter; however, a comforter is usually a slightly different type of bedding that is not as thick, does not have a cover, and is often used over a top sheet. ==History== From Viking times, duvets of eider down were used by people on the northern coast of Norway. From the 16th century, wealthy people all over Europe began buying and using such duvets. In the story The Princess and the Pea, published in 1835, H.C. Andersen wrote about a princess lying on 10 eiderdown duvets. In the mid-18th century, Thomas Nugent, an Englishman on a grand tour then passing through Westphalia, observed with surprise: ==Description== A duvet without a cover A modern duvet, like a sleeping bag, may be filled with down or feathers of various quality and cost, or silk, wool, cotton, or artificial fibers such as polyester batting. Duvets can reduce the complexity of making a bed, as they can be used without a top sheet, blankets or quilts or other bed covers. Duvets can be made warmer than blankets without becoming heavy. The duvet itself fits into a specially made cover, usually of cotton or a cotton- polyester blend. The duvet cover can be removed and laundered as often as the bottom sheet and pillow cases. The duvet itself may be cleaned much more rarely, and depending on its contents, may require specialist dry cleaning. While a comforter is fundamentally the same as a duvet in terms of construction, it is used somewhat differently. In the United States, comforters are used on top of the flat sheet, often without a cover. ==Regional variations== Duvets are the most common form of bed covering, especially in northern Europe. They became popular throughout the world in the late 20th century. A British traveller in Germany in the 1930s encountered them: \\"She even learned to like feather quilts ('they don't seem to know about blankets ‚Äì perhaps they didn't have them in the middle ages')\\"Julia Boyd, Travellers in the Third Reich, Elliot and Thompson Limited, London, 2017, , page 67 Originally called a continental quilt across Australia, a duvet is now often called a doona, which is the brand name created by Kimptons (Northern Feather). The Tontine Group acquired the trademark in 1991 when its owner, Pacific Dunlop, took over Northern Feather. \\"Doona\\" is derived from the equivalent Danish and Norwegian term \\"dyne\\" and was popularized by the retailer IKEA in the 1970s. In Asian countries like India and Pakistan, duvets are known as \\"ralli quilts\\" or razai. ==Thermal performance (tog rating)== Manufacturers rate the performance of their duvets in togs, a measurement of thermal insulation. This enables the purchaser to select a duvet appropriate to the season: the higher the tog rating, the warmer the duvet. A few manufacturers have marketed combined duvet set consisting of one 4.5 tog and one 9.0 tog. The light-weight one is for summer and the medium one for spring and autumn; snapped together, 13.5 togs is designed for winter. Manufacturers may also offer up to 15 tog duvets. ==Standards and sizes== Modern manufacturing conventions have resulted in a large number of sizes and standards. ==In popular culture== The term \\"duvet day\\" is used in some countries to describe an allowance of one or more days a year when employees can simply phone in and say that they are not coming in to work, even though they have no leave booked and are not ill. The provision of this benefit became fashionable in the late 1990s with many larger companies in the UK. == See also == * Fill power * Futon * Silk comforter == References == == External links == * Category:Blankets ","title":"Duvet"},{"id":"822708","text":"Johann Heinrich Acker (12 August 1647 ‚Äì 21 September 1719) was a German writer.

It may range from just sulking to malevolent abusive controlling behaviour. It may be a passive-aggressive form of emotional abuse in which displeasure, disapproval and contempt is exhibited through nonverbal gestures while maintaining verbal silence. Clinical psychologist Harriet Braiker identifies it as a form of manipulative punishment. == Origin of term == The term originated from \\"treatment\\" through silence, which was fashionable in prisons in the 19th century. In use since the prison reforms of 1835, the silent treatment was used in prisons as an alternative to physical punishment, as it was believed that forbidding prisoners from speaking, calling them by a number rather than their name, and making them cover their faces so they couldn't see each other would encourage reflection on their crimes. == In personal relationships == In a relationship, the silent treatment can be a difficult pattern to break because if it is ingrained, relationships may then ultimately fail.USA Today (August 3, 2014) Silent treatment speaks volumes about a relationship The silent treatment is sometimes used as a control mechanism. The silent treatment is a passive-aggressive action where a person feels bad but is unable to express themselves. Their being 'silent' still communicates a message. It can generate what the sulker wants, such as attention and the knowledge others are hurt, plus a feeling of power from creating uncertainty over how long the 'silence' will last.Petra Boynton The Telegraph (26 Apr 2013 Silent treatment: how to snap him out of it Sometimes the goal of the silent treatment is simply to communicate displeasure and once the message has been received and understood the silent treatment ends. Abusers punish their victims by refusing to speak to them or even acknowledge their presence. Through silence, the abusers loudly communicate their displeasure, anger and frustration.Gregory L. (2009) Healing the Scars of Emotional Abuse The consequences of this behavior on the person isolated by silence are feelings of incompetence and worthlessness. == In the workplace == Research by the Workplace Bullying Institute suggests that \\"using the silent treatment to ice out & separate from others\\" is the fourth most common of all workplace bullying tactics experienced, and is reported in 64 percent of cases of workplace bullying. The silent treatment is a recognized form of abusive supervision. Other forms include: reminding the victim of past failures, failing to give proper credit, wrongfully assigning blame or blowing up in fits of temper.James Larsen Abusive Supervision Article No. 309 Business Practice Findings == Tactical ignoring == Tactical ignoring is a strategy where a person gives no outward sign of recognizing a behavior, such as no eye contact, no verbal response, or electronic response, and no physical response. However, the person remains aware of the behavior and monitors the individual to ensure their safety and the safety of others. It is similar to, although not identical to, the silent treatment, in that tactical ignoring is a behavioral management technique that, when correctly applied, can result in the reduction of undesirable behaviors. One of the principles of tactical ignoring is to analyse the behavior to see the message that is being communicated by the individual. This message, the need for attention or to gain a reaction, requires a response. The aim is to provide the person with positive and quality attention for displaying appropriate behaviors, or for not displaying the undesired behavior. When the person displays the undesired behavior in order to gain attention, the planned ignoring strategy is to ignore the behavior. This strategy uses the same foundation as that underlying positive behavior support and applied behavior analysis in that positive behavior is encouraged with reinforcement, and unwanted behaviors are discouraged with ignoring or punishment. The use of tactical ignoring is taught in parent management training, but is suitable for changing unwanted adult behavior or unwanted child behavior. Tactical ignoring can be one element of a behavior management plan when there are a variety of challenging behaviors being addressed. Because it is a method that involves not responding to an undesirable behavior, it should be complemented by differential reinforcement for an alternative behavior, as seen in functional communication training, a procedure to teach a more appropriate attention-seeking behavior. == In the media == * Shirley Ann Millard Mr Toad Gets the Silent Treatment (1999) * J.

It is between and and is in Travelcard Zone 3. It is situated on the south side of the east-west Western Avenue (A40), surrounded by residential Ealing and industrial Park Royal. There is a pedestrian subway under the A40 road near the station. The station's platforms have a continuous significant gradient (sloping up from south to north). ==History== The District Railway (DR, now the District line) opened the line through Park Royal on its new extension to on 23 June 1903. A station, Park Royal & Twyford Abbey, was opened at that time a short distance to the north of the current station to serve the Royal Agricultural Society's recently opened Park Royal show grounds. The current station was built for the extension of Piccadilly line services over the District line tracks to . It opened on 6 July 1931 and replaced the earlier station which closed on the previous day. First opened as a temporary timber structure, the current station building was designed by Welch & Lander in an Art Deco/Streamline Moderne style influenced by the Underground's principal architect Charles Holden. The station buildings are formed from a series of simple interconnecting geometric shapes. Plain red brick masses are accented with strong horizontal and vertical glazed elements. A large circular ticket hall with high level windows gives access to the platform stairs. The enclosures for these form cascades of glazed steps down to the platforms. The most prominent feature of the station building is the tall square tower adjacent to the ticket hall. This is adorned with the Underground roundel; and represents a visible locator for the station from some distance. The permanent structure was opened in 1936. Attached to the station building and across the small open space of Hanger Green are two curved three-storey retail and office buildings built in the same style as the station. On 4 July 1932, the Piccadilly line was extended to run west of its original terminus at sharing the route with the District line to . From Ealing Common to South Harrow, the District line was replaced by the Piccadilly line. From 1 March 1936 until 1947 the station name was modified to Park Royal (Hanger Hill). The suffix was then dropped and the station returned to the unmodified version. Hanger Hill referred to a residential estate adjacent to the station. ==Possible development== The Mayor's plans for the area include improvements to the station access. In 2018, it was announced that the station would gain step free access by 2022, as part of a ¬£200m investment to increase the number of accessible stations on the Tube.

This would have served the business park and provide a walking distance interchange with Park Royal station.First Central Business Park . This is not being actively pursued.

At the time of her birth, she was missing most of her brain, including the cortex; only the brainstem, the portion of the brain responsible for autonomic and regulatory functions, such as the control of respiration, the heartbeat and blood pressure, had developed during pregnancy. ===Opposing viewpoints=== Keene's mother had been notified of her condition following ultrasonography, and was advised to terminate the pregnancy by her obstetrician and neonatologist but chose to carry the child to term because of \\"a firm Christian faith that all life should be protected\\". The hospital believed that care provided to the baby would be futile, while the mother believed mechanical breathing support must be provided during the baby's periodic respiratory crises. Fairfax Hospital doctors strongly advised a \\"do not resuscitate\\" order for the child, which the mother refused. Stephanie remained on ventilator support for six weeks while Fairfax searched for another hospital to transfer her to, but no other hospital would accept her. After the baby was weaned off constant ventilator support, the mother agreed to move the child to a nursing facility, but the baby returned to the hospital many times for respiratory problems. ===Legal proceedings=== When baby Keene was admitted to the hospital at six months of age for severe respiratory problems, the hospital filed a legal motion to appoint a guardian for the child's care and sought a court order that the hospital did not need to provide any services beyond palliative care. At trial, several experts testified that providing ventilator support to an anencephalic infant went beyond the accepted standard of medical care.Matter of Baby K., 16 F. 3d 590 (4th Cir. 1994). In contrast, the baby's mother argued her case on the grounds of religious freedom and the sanctity of life. In a controversial ruling, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia decided that the hospital caring for Keene must put her on a mechanical ventilator whenever she had trouble breathing. The court interpreted the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) to require continued ventilation for the infant. The wording of this act requires that patients who present with a medical emergency must get \\"such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition\\" before the patient is transferred to another facility. The court refused to take a moral or ethical position on the issue, insisting that it was only interpreting the laws as they existed. As a result of the decision, Keene was kept alive much longer than most anencephalic babies. It has been suggested by the dissenting judge in the case that the court should have used the condition anencephaly as the basis of the case, not the recurring subsidiary symptoms of respiratory distress. As the irreversibility of anencephaly is widely understood in the medical community, he argued that the decision to continue futile care only resulted in the repetitive diversion of medical equipment. Keene died on April 5, 1995, at Fairfax Hospital, at age 2 years 174 days. (Registration required) ==Significance== The case of Baby K is of particular importance to the field of bioethics because of the issues it raises: the definition of death, the nature of personhood, the concept of futile medical care, and many issues relating to the allocation of scarce resources. Some commentators, including Arthur Kohrman and Jacob Appel, have argued that the ruling effectively undermined the right of physicians to make sound medical decisions. ==See also== *Baby Doe Law ==References== ==External links== *Futile Care and the Neonate: In the Matter of Baby K at Medscape Category:1992 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Medical controversies in the United States K ","title":"Baby K"},{"id":"822790","text":"Les amiti√©s particuli√®res book cover, 1973) Les amiti√©s particuli√®res is a 1943 novel by French writer Roger Peyrefitte, probably his best-known work today, which won the Prix Renaudot. Largely autobiographical, it deals with an intimate relationship between two boys at a Roman Catholic boarding school and how it is destroyed by a priest's will to protect them from homosexuality.The phrase \\"les Amiti√©s particulieres\\" appears to have been coined in 1724 by the Jesuit priest Father Joseph-Fran√ßois Lafitau (1681-1746) in his study Moeurs des sauvages ameriquains, compar√©es aux moeurs des premier temps (Paris 1724, vol. 1, pp. 603-09): \\"L‚ÄôAthenrosera, ou les Amiti√©s particuli√®res [sic] entre les jeunes gens [. . .]\\" In the translation by W. N. Fenton & E. L. Moore as Customs of the American Indian compared with the customs of primitive times. (See vol. 1, Toronto, 1974, pp. 361, 364.) \\"The Athenrosera, or particular friendships, between young people which prevail almost in the same way from one end of America to the other.[...] Among the North American Indians these relationships of friendship carry no suspicion of apparent vice, although there is or may be much real vice. They are very ancient in their origin, very clear in their constant usage, sacred, if I dare say so, in the union which they form, the knots of which are as closely tied as those of blood and nature and can be broken only if one of them, making himself unworthy by cowardly acts which would dishonour his friend, [should] force him to renounce his alliance.[...] The parents are the first to encourage these friendships and to respect their rights [...] the two become companions in hunting, warfare, and good or bad fortune; they are entitled to food and shelter in each other‚Äôs lodging.\\" The book has been translated into English by Felix Giovanelli (1950) and Edward Hyams (1958), both times under the title Special Friendships, the latter reissued in the United States as Secret Friendships.Both of these translations are slight abridgements, frequently omitting anything from a few words to several sentences or a whole paragraph. , they are out of print. In 1964 a film adaptation, Les amiti√©s particuli√®res, was made, directed by Jean Delannoy. ==Plot summary== The plot revolves around Georges de Sarre, a fourteen-year-old boy who is sent to a Catholic boarding school in 1920s France. Getting to know the other boys, he is immediately interested in Lucien Rouvi√®re, of whom he is warned by the unsympathetic Marc de Blajan, who cryptically informs him that some of the students \\"may seem good, but are in fact not\\". Georges is dismayed when he learns that Lucien already has a boyfriend, Andr√© Ferron. He befriends Lucien, but filled with envy, tries to destroy their relationship, eventually succeeding in getting Andr√© expelled in a Machiavellian scheme. When his advances towards Lucien remain fruitless, Georges starts a \\"special friendship\\", i.e. a friendship with homosexual overtones, with a twelve-year-old student, the beautiful Alexandre (Alexander) Motier. The priests who lead the school disapprove of these relationships, even though it does not go beyond a few kisses and love poems, with no sexual connotation. Despite their air of condemnation of these special friendships, some of the priests harbour sexual feelings for the boys. One of them, Father de Trennes, likes to invite boys to join him in his room at night for a few drinks and cigarettes. Georges continues his scheming ways and gets Father de Trennes expelled by an anonymous letter. However, Father Lauzon, who is a friend of Alexandre's family and wants to protect him, learns about their relationship and demands that it be ended immediately. Lauzon talks Georges into giving back the love letters from Alexandre, which at the time the novel is set meant that a relationship was over. In the film version this is straightforward: Georges is forced to return the letters, but Alexandre cannot see this, thinks that Georges had abandoned him, and commits suicide. The account in the novel is more complicated: Georges is aware that he could deceive the priest by handing over only a few of the letters and that Alexandre would then know that he was not ending their affair, but nevertheless he decides to return them all, in order to subject the boy to a 'test' and a 'passing crisis', and thereby lead him to abandon his wild plans of running away from home in order for the two of them to decamp together (p. 397 of the 1946 edition). What is clear is that Georges is not single-minded in his attachment to their affair in the way that Alexandre is. The shock of the boy's death, however, works a change of heart, and the novel ends with his attaining the same devotion to love that Alexandre had shown. The work has been praised for its elegant style, and the discretion with which the subject is treated. One example is the question which Alexander poses to Georges: \\"Georges, do you know the things one should not know?\\" ==Relationship to Peyrefitte's biography and other similar works== The plot is understood to be largely autobiographical, with de Sarre being Peyrefitte's alter ego in the book. As in the book, Peyrefitte had a relationship with a younger student at a Catholic boarding school and, as in the book, his love interest eventually committed suicide. The reader can follow George de Sarre's later life as a diplomat in Greece in Peyrefitte's Les Ambassades and La Fin des ambassades, where he also meets Father de Trennes again. Again, this parallels Peyrefitte's life as a diplomat in the 1930s/1940s. Peyrefitte was on (mostly) friendly terms with Henry de Montherlant, who in his later years wrote a novel (Les Gar√ßons, 1969) about a similar relationship. There exists substantial correspondence between the two on, among other things, love for boys and young men. ==Bibliography== *Les amiti√©s particuli√®res: roman / Roger Peyrefitte.

It is between and stations and is in Zone 2. The station is located in the south of Fulham, adjacent to Fulham High Street and New Kings Road (A308) and is a short distance from the north end of Putney Bridge from which it takes its name. ==History== The station was opened on 1 March 1880 as Putney Bridge & Fulham when the District Railway (DR, now the District line) extended its line south from . The station served as the terminus of the line until 1889 when the DR built Fulham Railway Bridge across the River Thames and extended the line south to the London and South Western Railway's (L&SWR;'s) newly built East Putney station where it connected to the L&SWR;'s new line to Wimbledon. Services from the station to Wimbledon began on 3 June 1889. The station has an ornate yellow brick fa√ßade at the entrance. On 1 September 1902,Forgotten Stations of Greater London by J.E.Connor and B.Halford the station was renamed Putney Bridge & Hurlingham referring to its proximity to Hurlingham Park and the Hurlingham Club. It received its current name in 1932. Despite taking its name from Putney Bridge, the tube station is in fact on the Fulham side of the Thames and is not actually located in Putney. ==Nearby places of interest== A World War Two pillbox can clearly be seen at the Southern end of the Southbound platform, overlooking Fulham Railway Bridge. In addition to the Hurlingham club and Hurlingham Park, Fulham Palace, the former home of the Bishops of London is nearby. It now contains a small museum set in Bishop's Park. Fulham Football Club's Craven Cottage stadium is about 1 kilometre to the north-west, and the tube station is often very busy on matchdays. ==Recent developments== Putney Bridge had a bay platform (platform 2) which could only accommodate C stock trains and was located between the current eastbound and westbound tracks. After the C stock was removed from service in June 2014, the bay platform ceased to be used, and the track was lifted as of October 2015. This platform was brought back into use in May 2016. The previous terminating end is now joined to the westbound track and platform 3 is no longer in use and is fenced off. This eliminated the previous 10 mph speed restriction on the westbound side. ==Connections== London Buses routes 14, 22, 39, 74, 85, 93, 220, 265, 270, 414, 424 and 430 and night routes N22 and N74 serve the station. ==Gallery== File:PutneyBridge2.jpg Putney Bridge underground station platforms (September 2006) File:Putney_Bridge_Underground_Station_-_geograph.org.uk_-_685230.jpgThe outside of Putney Bridge Station File:PBridgePillbox.JPG Southern end of the platforms at Putney Bridge station, showing the reversing siding, the World War 2 pillbox defending the bridge, and the northern tip of the bridge ==References== ==External links== * London Transport Museum Photographic Archive ** Category:District line stations Category:Proposed Chelsea-Hackney Line stations Category:Tube stations in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham Category:Former Metropolitan District Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1880 Category:1880 establishments in England ","title":"Putney Bridge tube station"},{"id":"822815","text":"Arnold Ruge. Arnold Ruge (13 September 1802 ‚Äì 31 December 1880) was a German philosopher and political writer. He was the older brother of Ludwig Ruge. ==Studies in university and prison== Born in Bergen auf R√ºgen, he studied in Halle, Jena and Heidelberg. As an advocate of a free and united Germany, he shared in the student agitations of 1821‚Äì24, and was jailed from 1824 to 1830 in the fortress of Kolberg, where he studied Plato and the Greek poets. Moving to Halle on his release, he published a number of plays ‚Äî including Schill und die Seinen, a tragedy ‚Äî and translations of ancient Greek texts ‚Äî e.g. Oedipus at Colonus. He became a Privatdozent at the University of Halle in 1832. ==Hegelians== He also became associated with the Young Hegelians. In 1837 with E. T. Echtermeyer he founded the Hallesche Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr deutsche Kunst und Wissenschaft. In this periodical he discussed the questions of the time from the point of view of the Hegelian philosophy.Warren Breckman, \\"Arnold Ruge: Radical Democracy and the Politics of Personhood, 1838-1843,\\" Marx, the Young Hegelians and the Origins of Radical Social Theory: Dethroning the Self.

In Paris, Ruge co-edited the Deutsch‚ÄìFranz√∂sische Jahrb√ºcher with Karl Marx briefly.Copleston p.307 He had little sympathy with Marx's socialistic theories, and soon left him. He left Paris in 1845 for Switzerland, and then became a bookseller in Leipzig. ==Revolutions of 1848== In the revolutionary movement of 1848, he organized the extreme left in the Frankfurt parliament, and for some time he lived in Berlin as the editor of the Die Reform. He supported the Polish demands during the revolution, but based on his belief that failure to meet Polish demands would result in Russia unleashing \\"the hatred of the entire Slavic element, of this monstrous family of peoples.\\"Brian E. Vick, Defining Germany: the 1848 Frankfurt parliamentarians and national identity, Harvard University Press, 2002, p. 192. The Prussian government intervened and Ruge soon afterwards left again for Paris, hoping, through his friend Alexandre Ledru-Rollin, to establish relations between German and French republicans; but in 1849 both Ledru-Rollin and Ruge had to take refuge in London. ==London and Brighton== In London, in company with Giuseppe Mazzini and other advanced politicians, he formed a ‚ÄúEuropean Democratic Committee.‚Äù From this Ruge soon withdrew, and in 1850, Ruge moved to Brighton to live as a teacher and writer. In 1866, he vigorously supported Prussia against Austria in the Austro-Prussian War, and in 1870, he supported Germany against France in the Franco-Prussian War. On a smaller scale, while in Brighton, he was chairman of the successful Park Crescent Residents' Association. In his last years, beginning in 1877, he received from the German government a pension of 1000 marks. He died in Brighton in 1880. ==Works== Ruge was a leader in religious and political liberalism, but did not produce any work of enduring importance . In 1846-48 his Gesammelte Schriften (Collected writings) were published in ten volumes. After this time he wrote, among other books, Manifest an die deutsche Nation (1866), Geschichte unserer Zeit (1881), Unser System, Revolutionsnovellen, Die Loge des Humanismus, and Aus fr√ºherer Zeit (his memoirs; 1863‚Äì67). He also wrote many poems, and several dramas and romances, and translated into German various English works, including the Letters of Junius and Buckle's History of Civilization.

Staff operate from a container-sized portable office. Recently a number of self-service touch-screen ticket machines have been added, which accept coins, credit cards and notes. Oyster card validators have also been installed. The station was briefly equipped with APTIS equipment in 1988/89. ==Services and connections== The normal London Overground passenger service is four trains per hour in each direction, dropping to half-hourly in the evenings.

The station is served by a train every 15 minutes in both directions throughout the day, though from June 2016 until February 2017 the service was suspended (with a rail-replacement bus in operation) whilst the line underwent major rebuilding work associated with electrification. ==References== ==External links== Category:Railway stations in the London Borough of Waltham Forest Category:Former Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1894 Category:Railway stations served by London Overground Category:Walthamstow ","title":"Walthamstow Queen's Road railway station"},{"id":"822839","text":"PRF may refer to: ==Science and technology== * Physical register file, in CPU design * Platelet rich fibrin, a combination of platelets and fibrin used to regenerate tissue * Pontine reticular formation * Positive-real function, a mathematical complex function with applications in electrical engineering * Primitive recursive function, a class of functions which form an important building block on the way to a full formalization of computability * Programmed ribosomal frameshifting, a biological phenomenon that occurs during mRNA translation * Pseudorandom function family, a function with values seemingly chosen randomly within its range in cryptography * Pulse repetition frequency, a characteristic of a radar transmitter ==Organizations== * Pol√≠cia Rodovi√°ria Federal, the Federal Highway Police of Brazil * Progeria Research Foundation, a non-profit research organization ==Other uses== * Pacific Ring of Fire, a ring of volcanoes circling the Pacific Ocean * Passer rating formula, a system used to rate passers in American football * Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire, US * Perfect (grammar), a glossing abbreviation in linguistics ==See also== * TV Tupi (call letters: PRF-3), a defunct television station in Brazil ","title":"PRF"},{"id":"822860","text":"The Worm Ouroboros is a heroic high fantasy novel by English writer E. R. Eddison, first published in 1922. The book describes the protracted war between the domineering King Gorice of Witchland and the Lords of Demonland in an imaginary world that appears mainly medieval and partly reminiscent of Norse sagas. The work is slightly related to Eddison's later Zimiamvian Trilogy, and collectively they are sometimes referred to as the Zimiamvian series. The book was illustrated by Keith Henderson, who also illustrated books by Geoffrey Chaucer and W. H. Hudson. ==Plot== A framing story in the first two chapters describes the world of the novel as Mercury, though it is clearly a fantasy version of Earth, a \\"secondary world\\"; no effort was made to conform to the scientific knowledge of Mercury as it existed at the time of writing. At a number of points the characters refer to their land as Middle earth, used here in its original sense of \\"the known world\\", and the gods worshiped have the names of deities from Greek mythology. Oddly, the introductory framing story has a beginning, but is not referred to once the actual fantasy adventure begins. (Framing, as a technique, usually opens and closes a separate story contained inside the frame-narrative.) The framing story having introduced the chief lords of Demonland‚Äîthe brothers Juss, Spitfire, and Goldry Bluszco, and their cousin Brandoch Daha‚Äîthe story begins in earnest with a dwarf ambassador from Witchland arriving in Demonland to demand that the Demons recognize King Gorice XI of Witchland as their overlord. Juss and his brothers reply that they and all of Demonland will submit if the king (a famous wrestler) can defeat Goldry Bluszco in a wrestling match. The match is held in the neutral territory of the Foliot Isles, and Gorice is killed. His successor (or reincarnation) Gorice XII is a sorcerer who banishes Goldry to an enchanted mountain prison, by means of a perilous sorcery requiring the help of the devious Goblin traitor Lord Gro. While Lord Spitfire is sent back to raise an army out of Demonland, Lord Juss and his cousin Brandoch Daha, aided by King Gaslark of Goblinland, attempt an assault on Carc√´, the capital of the Witches, where they think Goldry is held. The rescue fails, the Goblins flee, and Juss and Brandoch Daha are both captured. They escape with the aid of La Fireez, the prince of Pixyland and vassal of King Gorice, who helps them at great personal cost because he owes them a debt of honor. Juss and Brandoch Daha return home to Demonland and then start an expedition to rescue Goldry Bluszco from his terrible prison, somewhere past the mountains of Impland. Lord Spitfire again stays behind to lead Demonland's armies against an expected invasion from Witchland. The expedition's fleet is smashed and its army destroyed. Juss and Brandoch Daha meet with three strange enchanted heroes of an earlier time, and Lord Juss is later nearly killed by a manticore. After a year of wandering they climb the mighty peak of Koshtra Pivrarcha and then attempt the even more difficult peak of Koshtra Belorn. Before reaching the summit of Koshtra Belorn they encounter Queen Sophonisba, a royal from that area to whom the gods had granted eternal youth when her realm was laid waste by the Witches. From Sophonisba they learn that Goldry is held in prison on the top of Zora Rach Nam, a mountain which cannot be climbed and whose peak is surrounded by unceasing flames. There is only one way to free him: they must find a hippogriff's egg, and one of them must ride the newly hatched hippogriff. Queen Sophonisba gives Lord Juss one hippogriff egg. Alas, their lone companion, the Impland native Mivarsh Faz (knowing that he will have to walk back home alone, if the Demons get the hippogriff) steals the egg and tries to use it himself, causing his death. Lord Juss and Brandoch Daha set out for home, their quest defeated for the time being. But matters are not completely hopeless, as one of Queen Sophonisba's martlet scouts have told them of another hippogriff egg, lying at the bottom of a lake in Demonland. Meanwhile, the armies of Witchland have attacked Demonland. Duke Corsus is the first commander of the Witchland army, and conquers part of Demonland, but is defeated by Spitfire. A new Witchland army, under the command of Lord Corinius, defeats Spitfire and captures most of Demonland. This includes Brandoch Daha's castle of Krothering, which had been watched over by his sister Lady Mevrian. At this point, Lord Gro changes sides and helps Lady Mevrian escape from the grasp of Corinius, who wishes to marry her against her will. A few months later, Lord Juss and Brandoch Daha return and expel the Witches from Demonland. Equipped with a new hippogriff egg, Lord Juss makes a second attempt to rescue his brother, and this time is successful. However, his forces are trapped in an inland sea by the Witchland navy; forced to engage in battle directly, they completely destroy that navy. La Fireez dies in this battle. The Demons then sail to Carc√´ and face the remaining forces of Witchland in a climactic struggle. In the battle, Lord Gro is lambasted by Corund for switching sides; Gro responds by killing a Demon and is himself killed by Spitfire. Corund dies from wounds he suffers fighting with the heroes of Demonland. His armies having failed, King Gorice attempts another terrible summoning; lacking the aid of Gro, he is unable to complete the spell and is destroyed. Duke Corsus poisons the remaining nobles of Witchland, and is killed himself by the dying Corinius. Though triumphant, the Demon lords find that victory is bitter because there are no more enemies worthy of their heroism, no more great deeds to perform. Sophonisba, seeking to reward their heroism, prays to the gods who return the world to how it had been four years before. And so, with a blare of trumpets, an ambassador from Witchland arrives, \\"craving present audience\\" and the story starts anew. ==Characters== Emblem of Demonland **The Demons and their allies** *Lord Juss is the chief lord of Demonland and a chief player in most of the battles in the story. He also leads two expeditions to rescue his brother Goldry Bluszco. *Goldry Bluszco is the brother of the hero and one of the chief lords of Demonland. Bluszco has two brothers, Lord Juss and Lord Spitfire. Unlike his bachelor brothers, Bluszco was betrothed to marry Princess Armelline of Goblinland. *Lord Spitfire is a Demon lord who spends most of the story in Demonland fighting the various Witchland invasions. His chief residence is the castle Owlswick. *Brandoch Daha is a lord of Demonland and the greatest swordsman of the age. After Corinius sacks his castle of Krothering, Brandoch Daha swears vengeance against Corinius. *Lady Mevrian is a great lady of Demonland and the sister of Brandoch Daha, who is left the task of defending her brother's castle of Krothering against Corinius's army. After a siege, the castle is taken and Lady Mevrian has to fend off the advances of Corinius. She is able to escape only with the aid of Heming and Cargo (Corund's sons) and Lord Gro, who betrays Witchland to help her. *Prince La Fireez is the ruler of Pixyland. Witchland has asserted suzerainty over his land, but he is consistently a Demon ally by way of repaying Lord Juss for saving his life. He dies in a naval battle. Emblem of Witchland **The Witchlanders and their allies** *Gorice is the King of Witchland, ruling from Carc√´; he is said to be a single king with twelve incarnations. His eleventh incarnation, a champion wrestler, is killed in a wrestling match by Goldry Bluszco; his twelfth, a sorcerer, wears a signet ring in the shape of the ouroboros of the book's title. *Corinius is a warrior leader of Witchland, full of life and ambition. He is an enemy of Demonland, and as warrior of some skill he commands some respect from the lords of Demonland. He is poisoned by Duke Corsus and dies right after the Demons take Carc√´. *Duke Corsus is one of the war leaders of the armies of Witchland. Duke Corsus was the chief war leader of Witchland a decade before the story begins. Corsus is wily and skillful but prone to drinking and no longer young. Right before the Demons conquer Carc√´, he poisons Corinius, his wife Zenambria, his son Dekalajus, Corund's son Viglus, and Corund's son Heming. Corinius kills him when he realizes that Corsus poisoned him. *Lord Corund is the chief war leader of the armies of Witchland. He is a noble man, a mighty warrior, and has some respect from the main characters. Corund leads the Witchland army against the Demonland expedition to Impland. He is fatally wounded by Lord Juss. *Lord Gro is an advisor to Witchland; later he is an ally of Demonland. Gro is originally from Goblinland and was the foster-brother of King Gaslark before a falling-out. Gro is a famous explorer and wrote a book about his travels through Impland. Gro provides crucial aid to King Gorice XII of Witchland when he summons the magic which carries Goldry Bluszco away. He acts as an advisor and trusted messenger to the King regarding the campaign in Demonland. While in Demonland he meets and falls in love with Brandoch Daha's sister, the Lady Mevrian. Because of his love, he betrays the Witchland army and helps Mevrian escape from Corinius after Corinius captures her brother's castle of Krothering. *Lady Prezmyra is the young wife of Corund and the sister of La Fireez of Pixyland. She is a close friend of Lord Gro, and poisons herself, after the death of her husband and her brother, when the Demons conquer Carc√´. ==The kingdoms of Mercury== Map by David Bedell, 1978. The named nations and countries are: * Witchland * Demonland * Pixyland * Impland * Goblinland * The Foliot Isles * The land Zimiamvia (beyond the known world) * The Ghouls, wiped out in a genocidal war a few years before the story opens The King of Witchland claims lordship over a number of locations which are not described (page 12): * Duke of Buteny and Estremerine * Commander of Shulan, Thramn√´, Mingos, and Permio * Warden of the Esamocian Marches * Duke of Trace * King Paramount of Beshtria and Nevria * Prince of Ar * Great Lord over Ojedia, Maltra√´ny, Baltary, and Toribia Despite the names of the nations, all the characters in the book are recognizably human and they are all the same species, or at least able to intermarry (e.g., Goldry Bluszco and Princess Armelline, Lord Corund and Lady Prezmyra). Witchland, Demonland, and others appear to be country names, like England and France. When first presented, the Demons are seen to have horns on their heads, but these horns are not mentioned again, nor is it said whether the other peoples have horns. ===Maps=== * Gerald Hayes, a cartographer with the Royal Navy, created the first map for Ouroboros circa 1925, initially from internal evidence, and later in consultation with Eddison. He states in a letter to C.S. Lewis that he secured Eddison's approval \\"as a true presentation of all the lands, seas, and countries of his history.\\"Source: Collected Letters of C.S. Lewis, Vol II, page 559. Not sure if it still exists! States crude copy made for Lewis. In Letters Vol II page 560 footnote 57, Hooper states that Hayes' map has survived. * Another map of the world by Bernard Morris was published in Twilight Zine No. 4 and reprinted in the book An Atlas of Fantasy (compiled by Jeremiah Benjamin Post) in 1979. * For another map of these lands created by J. B. Hare in 2004, see The world of The Worm Ouroboros. For a German map by Erhard Ringer see Der Wurm Ouroboros * The map on this page was created by David Bedell in 1978. ==Background== Research done by Paul Edmund Thomas (who wrote an introduction to the 1991 Dell edition) shows that Eddison started imagining the stories which would turn into The Worm Ouroboros at a very early age. An exercise book titled The Book of Drawings dated 1892 and created by Eddison is to be found at the Bodleian Library. In this book are 59 drawings in pencil, captioned by the author, containing many of the heroes and villains of the later work. Some of the drawings, such as The murder of Gallandus by Corsus and Lord Brandoch Daha challenging Lord Corund, depict events of Ouroboros. As might be expected, significant differences exist between the ideas of a 10-year-old boy and the work of a 40-year-old man. Perhaps the most interesting change is in Lord Gro's character. In the drawings Lord Gro is a hero of skill and courage, while in the book he is a conflicted character, never able to pick a side and stick to it. Another curious change is that Goldry Bluszco is the main hero of the drawings, but off-stage in an enchanted prison for most of the novel. Many people (including J. R. R. Tolkien) have wondered at and criticized Eddison's curious names for his characters (e.g. La Fireez, Fax Fay Faz), places and nations. According to Thomas, the answer appears to be that these names originated in the mind of a young boy, and Eddison could not, or would not, change them thirty years later when he wrote the stories down. ==Meaning of the title== Engraving by Lucas Jennis The title refers to Ouroboros (J√∂rmungandr in Norse mythology), the snake or dragon that swallows its own tail and therefore has no terminus (in Old English, the word \\"worm\\" could mean a serpent or dragon). Like the Ouroboros, the story ends at the same place as it begins, when the heroes realize that their lives have little meaning without the great conflict and wish that it could continue, and their wish is granted. The theme of repetition pervades the work. Near the beginning and again near the end, a king of Witchland dies, Carc√´ is attacked, and Gorice XII carries out a conjuring in the fortress's Iron Tower. There are two quests to find and recover Goldry Bluszco. Three armies, under the influence of an enchantment, chase each other in an endless campaign until the heroes shatter the cycle on their quest. ==Comparison with other works== The Worm Ouroboros is often compared with J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings (which it predates by 32 years). Tolkien read The Worm Ouroboros, and praised it in print. C. S. Lewis wrote a short preface to an anthology of Eddison's works, including The Worm Ouroboros, concluding that \\"No writer can be said to remind us of Eddison.\\" In contrast to The Lord of the Rings, to which mythopoeia is central, Eddison makes few references either to actual mythology or to an invented mythology after the fashion of the Silmarillion. One example of this is Eddison's ad hoc names for people and places versus Tolkien's invention of entire languages. Also, while The Lord of the Rings is written mostly in modern English, Eddison wrote The Worm Ouroboros largely in sixteenth-century English, making use of his experience translating Norse sagas and reading medieval and Renaissance poetry; a nearly unique approach among popular fantasy novels.http://www.swordandsorcery.org/wormouroboros.asp Eddison incorporates a number of actual early modern poems into the story, including Shakespeare's 18th sonnet, all meticulously credited in an appendix. The tale's morality has also been described as uncommon in modern fantasy; in particular, it differs sharply from Tolkien's heroism of the common man in a fight against evil and C. S. Lewis's Christian allegory. The Demon lords hold to the Old Norse warrior ethic of loyalty and glory. The leaders of Witchland are regarded as noble and worthy opponents; in the final chapter, Goldry Bluszco compares them very favorably with the \\"uncivil races\\" of Impland. ==Influence and reception== New York Times critic Edwin Clark praised the novel lavishly, saying \\"This romance has the gaudiness and flair of the Elizabethans. It has the exuberance of great appetites and vigorous living. It transcends all ordinary life. It burns with the wonder and awe of excess.\\" But Clark also noted that Eddison \\"is stylistic in the grand and heroic manner that evokes beauty and vigorous life, but it seems to us that without injury to his verbal charm or loss of beauty in his passage of atmosphere saturated with glamour of nature, he could have removed much that would quicken the action of his narration to a more attractive pace.\\"\\"Mythology a la Mode\\", The New York Times Book Review, June 6, 1926, pp. 13, 20 Reviewing a 1952 edition, Boucher and McComas described it as \\"one of the major imaginative novels of this century\\" and \\"the detailed creation of a vividly heroic alien history.\\" They particularly commended \\"the resonant clangor of its prose, the tremendous impetus of its story-telling, [and] the magnificent audacity (and sternly convincing consistency) of its fantasy concepts.\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, April 1953, p. 99 Donald Barr declared that Eddison wrote \\"in a heroic prose made of high ceremonial gestures and tropes from the great age of metaphor and described The Worm as being \\"quite unique among modern novels\\" as \\"a narrative of pure event\\" where, with a lone exception, \\"we are never given the interior of a character, only the actions\\".\\"A Place of Ought-to-Be\\", The New York Times Book Review, December 28, 1952, p/6 In 1963, Avram Davidson praised the novel's prose for \\"abound[ing] in beautiful, quotable language\\" and its story as one of \\"war, witchcraft, adventure, conspiracy, violence, bloodshed, intrigue.\\" Davidson, though, faulted Eddison's conception, saying \\"Ouroboros is a classic, but it is not and cannot be a great classic,\\" because it lacks \\"humanity\\"‚Äîthe realistic detail of great works like the Arabian Nights, where characters \\"do not merely kiss and declaim and posture.\\"\\"Books\\", F&SF;, October 1963, pp. 19‚Äì20 However, J. Max Patrick, also reviewing the Xanadu paperback, dismissed the novel as \\"a pseudo-Ossianic epic, adolescent in tone and pretentiously archaic\\", although commenting that \\"Eddison sometimes achieves the splendid prose and gorgeous artifice appropriate to his sagas.\\"\\"Adventures in Imagination\\", The New York Times Book Review, April 7, 1963 Karl Edward Wagner was influenced by The Worm Ouroboros as a teenager.\\"Wagner was influenced by the weighty Gothic novels...such as \\"Melmoth the Wanderer\\", \\"The Castle of Otranto\\", and \\"The Worm Ouroboros\\"\\".

He disappeared during an expedition in the Asmat region of southwestern Netherlands New Guinea, which is now a part of the Indonesian province of Papua. In 2014, Carl Hoffman published a book that went into detail about the inquest into his killing, in which villagers and tribal elders admit to Rockefeller being killed after he swam to shore in 1961. Despite these claims, no remains or other proof of his death have ever been discovered. ==Early life== Rockefeller was the fifth and last child of Mary Todhunter Rockefeller and Nelson Rockefeller. He was the third son of seven children fathered by Nelson Rockefeller, and he had a twin sister, Mary. After attending The Buckley School in New York, and graduating from the Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, where he was a student senator and exceptional varsity wrestler, Rockefeller graduated cum laude from Harvard University with a B.A. in history and economics. In 1960, he served for six months as a private in the U.S. Army and then went on an expedition for Harvard's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology to study the Dani tribe of western Netherlands New Guinea. The expedition filmed Dead Birds, an ethnographic documentary movie produced by Robert Gardner, and for which Rockefeller was the sound recordist. Rockefeller and a friend briefly left the expedition to study the Asmat tribe of southern Netherlands New Guinea. After returning home from the Peabody expedition, Rockefeller returned to New Guinea to study the Asmat and collect Asmat art. > \\"It's the desire to do something adventurous,\\" he explained, \\"at a time when > frontiers, in the real sense of the word, are disappearing.\\" He spent his time in Netherlands New Guinea actively engaged with the culture and the art while recording ethnographic data. In one of his letters home he wrote: > I am having a thoroughly exhausting but most exciting time here ...

New York, NY: The New York Graphic Society ==Disappearance== On November 17, 1961, Rockefeller and Dutch anthropologist Ren√© Wassing were in a dugout canoe about from shore when their double pontoon boat was swamped and overturned.The Search for Michael Rockefeller Their two local guides swam for help, but it was slow in coming. After drifting for some time, early on November 19 Rockefeller said to Wassing \\"I think I can make it\\" and swam for shore. The boat was an estimated from the shore when he made the attempt to swim to safety, supporting the theory that he died from exposure, exhaustion, and/or drowning.The Michael C. Rockefeller Memorial Fellowship Wassing was rescued the next day, while Rockefeller was never seen again, despite an intensive and lengthy search effort. At the time, Rockefeller's disappearance was a major world news item. His body was never found. He was declared legally dead in 1964.1961 Life Magazine online retrieved March 26, 2010 ==Speculation== It is believed that Rockefeller either drowned or was attacked by a shark or saltwater crocodile. As headhunting and cannibalism were still present in some areas of Asmat in 1961, it has also been speculated that Rockefeller may have been killed and eaten by Asmat tribespeople.About the search for Michael Rockefeller, son of New York mayor Nelson Rockefeller, history of his mysterious disappearance. In 1969, the journalist Milt Machlin traveled to the island to investigate Rockefeller's disappearance. He dismissed reports of Rockefeller living as a captive or as a Kurtz-like figure in the jungle, but concluded that circumstantial evidence supported the idea that he had been killed.Lost Scion - Was Michael Rockefeller eaten by cannibals? Several leaders of Otsjanep village, where Rockefeller likely would have arrived had he made it to shore, had supposedly been killed by a Dutch patrol in 1958, thus providing some rationale for revenge by the tribe against someone from the \\"white tribe\\". Neither cannibalism nor headhunting in Asmat were indiscriminate, but rather were part of a tit-for-tat revenge cycle, so it is possible that Rockefeller found himself the inadvertent victim of such a cycle. The incident is described in \\"Dance of the Warriors\\", the second volume of the documentary series Ring of Fire by the Blair brothers. A book titled Rocky Goes West by author Paul Toohey claims that, in 1979, Rockefeller's mother hired a private investigator to go to New Guinea and try to resolve the mystery of his disappearance. The reliability of the story has been questioned, but Toohey claims that the private investigator swapped a boat engine for the skulls of the three men that a tribe claimed were the only white men they had ever killed. The investigator returned to New York and handed these skulls to the family, convinced that one of them was the skull of Rockefeller. If this event did actually occur, the family has never commented on it. However, the History Channel program Vanishings reported that Rockefeller's mother did pay a $250,000 reward to the investigator which was offered for final proof whether or not Michael Rockefeller was alive or dead.In 1961, 23-year-old Michael Rockefeller In the documentary film Keep the River on Your Right, Tobias Schneebaum states that he spoke with Asmat cannibals who described finding Rockefeller on the riverside and eating him.Keep the River on Your Right: A Modern Cannibal Tale (2000) ===2014 book on disappearance=== In 2014, Carl Hoffman published the book Savage Harvest: A Tale of Cannibals, Colonialism, and Michael Rockefeller's Tragic Quest for Primitive Art where he discusses researching Rockefeller's mysterious disappearance and presumed death. During multiple visits to the villages in the area, he heard several stories about men from Otsjanep killing Rockefeller after he swam to shore. The stories, which were similar to testimonials collected in the 1960s, center around a handful of men arguing and eventually deciding to kill Michael after he swam to shore, in revenge for a 1958 incident in which men from the village were killed in a confrontation with Dutch colonial officials. Soon after the murders, the villages were swept by a cholera epidemic and the villagers believed that it was retribution for killing Rockefeller. As Hoffman left one of the villages for the final time, he witnessed a man acting out a scene wherein someone was killed, and stopped to videotape it. When translated, the man was quoted as saying: > Don't you tell this story to any other man or any other village, because > this story is only for us. Don't speak. Don't speak and tell the story.

The band Guadalcanal Diary wrote a song about Rockefeller's disappearance called \\"Michael Rockefeller\\" which appeared on their 1986 album Jamboree. In the travel adventure book Ring of Fire: An Indonesian Odyssey the Blair brothers claim to have discussed Rockefeller's death with a tribesman who killed him. Christopher Stokes's short story \\"The Man Who Ate Michael Rockefeller\\", published in the 23rd issue of McSweeney's Quarterly Concern (Spring 2007), presents a fictional account of young Michael's demise. The 2004 novel King of America by Samantha Gillison is loosely based on the life of Michael Rockefeller.An unsolved mystery -Samantha Gillison weaves fact and fiction in a mesmerizing new novel - INTERVIEW BY ALDEN MUDGE The 2007 film Welcome to the Jungle deals with two young couples who venture after Michael Rockefeller (thinking they can make a lot of money if they find evidence of Rockefeller) but meet grisly demises. Jeff Cohen's play The Man Who Ate Michael Rockefeller, based on the short story by Christopher Stokes, had its world premiere in an Off Broadway production at the West End Theatre in New York, directed by Alfred Preisser, from September 10 to October 3, 2010. In 2011, Agamemnon Films released a documentary titled The Search for Michael Rockefeller, based on journalist Milt Machlin's book of the same name released in 1974. In his book, Carl Hoffman characterized Machlin's early book as \\"mostly the tale of a wild-goose chase\\" but still important in laying the groundwork for questioning official stories of Rockefeller's disappearance Hoffman, Carl. Savage Harvest. New York: William Morrow, 2014. Print. 232-232. The film introduces a third theory, that Rockefeller survived and was living among the locals. This theory is supported by a verbal claim of contact made by a mysterious Australian adventurer, plus a few frames of film footage showing a bearded white man among indigenous men, wearing local garb. In 2012, Michael's surviving twin sister Mary published a memoir, titled Beginning with the End: A Memoir of Twin Loss and Healing, about coping with her grief after the death of her brother. The book was issued in paperback in 2014 as When Grief Calls Forth the Healing. '' ==See also== * List of people who disappeared ==References== ==External links== * Asmat Art in the Michael C.

It is on the A836 road nine miles west of Thurso. The nuclear establishments were created in the 1950s. They were, the Nuclear Power Development Establishment (NPDE) for the development of civil fast breeder reactors, and the Vulcan Naval Reactor Test Establishment (NRTE), a military submarine reactor testing facility. Both these no longer perform their original research functions and will be completely decommissioned, some of which has been in progress for a while. The two establishments have been a major element in the economy of Thurso and Caithness, but this will decrease with the progress of decommissioning. The NPDE will enter an interim care and surveillance state by 2036, and become a brownfield site by 2336. An announcement in July 2020 that Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) will be taking over direct management of the site from the site licence company Dounreay Site Restoration Limited (DSRL) in 2021 has alleviated fears of 560 job losses. Press and Journal, July 11, 2020. The NRTE is to be decommissioned under a 10-year contract starting in 2023, ending in the creation of a brownfield site, which would be transferred to the NDA.The Press and Journal, March 13 2020. ==Dounreay settlement== Dounreay is the site of Dounreay Castle (now a ruin)Coventry, Martin (1997) The Castles of Scotland. Goblinshead. p.147 and its name derives from the Gaelic for 'fort on a mound,' Dounreay was the site of the battle of Sandside Chase in 1437. Robert Gordon's map of Caithness, 1642, uses Dounrae as the name of the castle.William J. Watson's The Celtic Place-names of Scotland gives the origin as D√∫nrath, possibly a reference to a broch. Dounreay was the site of a World War II airfield, called RAF Dounreay. It became HMS Tern (II) in 1944 when the airfield was transferred to the Admiralty from RAF Coastal Command as a satellite of HMS Tern at Twatt in Orkney. It never saw any action during the war and was placed into care and maintenance in 1949. ==Nuclear sites== There are two nuclear sites at Lower Dounreay built on and around the site of the former airfield. The Nuclear Power Development Establishment site is owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) but was previously owned and run by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority. Adjacent to this site is the Ministry of Defence Vulcan Naval Reactor Test Establishment. The two sites are best known for their five nuclear reactors, three formerly owned and operated by the UKAEA and two by the Ministry of Defence. ==Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment== Aerial shot ~1979. PFR in centreground, DFR 'sphere' top right Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment was formed in 1955 primarily to pursue the UK Government policy of developing civil fast breeder reactor (FBR) technology. The site was operated by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). Three nuclear reactors were built there by the UKAEA, two of them FBRs plus a thermal research reactor used to test construction materials subject to high radiation levels for the programme, and also fabrication and reprocessing facilities for the materials test rigs and for fuel for the FBRs. Dounreay was chosen as the reactor location, remote from large centres of population, for safety reasons. The site has been managed by the site licence Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) since 2012, but the NDA will assume complete control when DSRL becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of the NDA in March 2021. NDA announcement 10th July 2020 ===Dounreay Materials Test Reactor=== The first of the Dounreay reactors to achieve criticality was the Dounreay Materials Test Reactor (DMTR) in May 1958, which was a DIDO class research reactor, producing a high neutron flux.New Scientist, November 1959, article at p.1055 This reactor was used to test the performance of materials under intense neutron irradiation, particularly those intended for fuel cladding and other structural uses in a fast neutron reactor core. Test pieces were encased in uranium-bearing alloy to increase the already high neutron flux of this class of reactor, and then chemically stripped of this coating after irradiation. DMTR was closed in 1969 when materials testing work was consolidated at Harwell Laboratory.

Power was exported to the National Grid from 14 October 1962 until the reactor was taken offline for decommissioning in March 1977. During its operational lifespan, DFR produced over 600 million kWh of electricity. archive-url = DFR and associated facilities cost ¬£15m to build. It was designed to generate 60 MW thermal power and achieve a 2% fuel burn up. It reached 30 MWt in August 1962, and 60 MWt in July 1963 allowing it to produce its rated 14 MWe (electrical). The reactor core was surrounded by a steel sphere, still a prominent feature of the landscape, and was constructed by the Motherwell Bridge Company. DFR was a loop-type FBR cooled by primary and secondary NaK circuits, with 24 primary coolant loops. The reactor core was initially fuelled with uranium metal fuel stabilised with molybdenum and clad in niobium. The core was later used to test oxide fuels for PFR and provide experimental space to support overseas fast reactor fuel and materials development programmes. It had over 5000 breeder elements of natural uranium in stainless steel arranged in an inner and outer breeder sections. Many were replaced in 1965. ===Prototype Fast Reactor (PFR)=== The third and final UKAEA-operated reactor to be built on the Dounreay site was the Prototype Fast Reactor (PFR). In 1966 it was announced that the PFR would be built at Dounreay. PFR was a pool-type fast breeder reactor, cooled by 1,500 tonnes of liquid sodium and fuelled with MOX. The design output of PFR was 250 MWe (electrical). It achieved criticality in 1974 and began supplying National Grid power in January 1975. There were many delays and reliability problems before reaching full power. It had three cooling circuits. Leaks in the sodium water steam generators shutdown one and then two of the cooling circuits in 1974 and 1975. By August 1976 it had reached 500 MWt (to produce about 166 MWe) and in 1985 it first reached its design output of 250 MWe. In 1988 it was announced that funding for FBR research was being cut from ¬£105 m pa to ¬£10 m pa and the PFR funding would end in 1994. The reactor was taken offline in 1994, marking the end of nuclear power generation at the site. It had supplied 9,250 GWh in all. The lifetime load factor recorded by the IAEA was 26.9%. The control panel for the reactor was earmarked for an exhibition on the reactor at the London Science Museum in 2016. ===Subsequent activity=== Since the reactors have all been shut down, care and maintenance of old plant and decommissioning activities have meant that Dounreay has still retained a large workforce. Commercial reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and waste was stopped by the UK government in 1998 although some waste is still accepted from other nuclear facilities in special circumstances. ==Significant accidentsSodium explosion=== A 65 metre deep shaft at the plant was packed with radioactive waste and at least 2 kg of sodium and potassium. On 10 May 1977 seawater, which flooded the shaft, reacted violently with the sodium and potassium, throwing off the massive steel and concrete lids of the shaft. This explosion littered the area with radioactive particles. ===Radioactive fuel swarf=== Tens of thousands of fragments of radioactive fuel escaped the plant between 1963 and 1984, resulting in fishing being banned within 2 km of the plant since 1997. These milled shards are thought to have washed into the sea as cooling ponds were drained. As of 2011, over 2,300 radioactive particles had been recovered from the sea floor, and over 480 from the beaches. As of 2019 the 2 km ban on harvesting seafood is still in place, but there are no other restrictionsMonitoring of beaches near Dounreay - regularly updated === Major power failure=== Following an incident in May 1998 where a mechanical digger cut through a main power cable and interrupted the site's main and back-up electricity supplies for 16 hours,The Herald 9th May 1998 operations were halted in the Fuel Cycle Area (FCA) and a safety audit of the plant was undertaken by the UK Health and Safety Executive and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. In September 1998 the highly critical report was published and made 143 recommendations for improvement.1998 safety audit of Dounreay. ONR and SEPA. Published: HSE books C30 8/98 The main points of concern were: 1\\\\. Weak management and technical base due to organisational changes 2\\\\. Over- dependence on contractors 3\\\\. No comprehensive strategy for waste disposal. 4\\\\. Lack of progress with decommissioning 5\\\\. Lack of integration of decommissioning and waste strategies 6\\\\. Poor physical condition of plant 7\\\\. Scope of rapid reporting was too narrow 8\\\\. Failure to work to the standards required of a modern nuclear licensee. The final report in 2001 on the audit noted that the UKAEA had responded satisfactorily to 89 recommendations, and the remaining 54 would be responded to in the medium to long term. Safety audit of Dounreay 1998, final report 2001. UK HSE; Document reference C5 01/02 pub Jan 2002 In November 1998, in the report \\"Dounreay - The way ahead\\", the UKAEA announced a proposed timetable for accelerated decommissioning, reducing the original schedule from 100 years to 60 years. The cost was initially estimated at ¬£4.3 billion. An accelerated decommissioning plan was welcomed by the Friends of the Earth Scotland, but the environmental group remained opposed to further fuel reprocessing at the site. ==Removal of fuel== Following the 1998 report the Department of Trade and Industry was presented with three options for dealing with 25 tonnes of radioactive reactor fuel at Dounreay. The options were: #to reprocess it at Dounreay, #to reprocess some at Dounreay and some at Sellafield, or #to store it above ground at Dounreay. A plan was eventually devised to remove irradiated and unirradiated fuel to the Sellafield nuclear site, starting in 2014. In 2018 the NDA reported that it would be completed in 2018/2019. The Press and Journal April 2018 ==Nuclear Decommissioning Authority ownership== On 1 April 2005 the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) became the owner of the site, with the UKAEA remaining as operator. Decommissioning of Dounreay was initially planned to bring the site to an interim care and surveillance state by 2036, and as a brownfield site by 2336, at a total cost of ¬£2.9 billion. A new company called Dounreay Site Restoration Limited (DSRL) was formed as a subsidiary of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) to handle the decommissioning process. By May 2008, decommissioning cost estimates had been revised. Removal of all waste from the site was expected to take until the late 2070s to complete and the end-point of the project was scheduled for 2300. Apart from decommissioning the reactors, reprocessing plant, and associated facilities, there were five main environmental issues to be dealt with: * A deep shaft used for intermediate level nuclear waste disposal was contaminating groundwater, and would be threatened by coastal erosion in about 300 years time. The shaft was never designed as a waste depository, but was used as such on a very ad hoc and poorly monitored basis, without reliable waste disposal records being kept. It was originally used to construct a tunnel for the sea discharge pipe. Later use of the shaft as a convenient waste depository had resulted in one hydrogen gas explosion caused by sodium and potassium wastes reacting with water. At one time it was normal for workers to fire rifles into the shaft to sink polythene bags floating on water. * Irradiated nuclear fuel particles on the seabed near the plant, estimated to be about several hundreds of thousands in number, caused by old fuel rod fragments being pumped into the sea. The beach had been closed since 1983 due to this. In 2008, a clean-up project using Geiger counter-fitted robot submarines was planned to search out and retrieve each particle individually. Particles were still being washed ashore at Sandside Bay beach and one particle at a popular tourist beach at Dunnet in 2006. In 2012, a two million becquerel particle was found at Sandside beach, twice as radioactive as any particle previously found. * of radiologically contaminated land, and of chemically contaminated land. * of high and medium active liquors and of unconditioned intermediate level nuclear waste in store. * of sodium, of which are radioactively contaminated from the Prototype Fast Reactor. Historically, much of Dounreay's nuclear waste management was poor. On 18 September 2006, Norman Harrison, acting chief operating officer, predicted that more problems will be encountered from old practices at the site as the decommissioning effort continues. Some parts of the plant are being entered for the first time in 50 years. In 2007 UKAEA pleaded guilty to four charges under the Radioactive Substances Act 1960 relating to activities between 1963 and 1984, one of disposing of radioactive waste at a landfill site at the plant between 1963 and 1975, and three of illegally dumping radioactive waste and releasing nuclear fuel particles into the sea, resulting in a fine of ¬£140,000. In 2007 a new decommissioning plan was agreed, with a schedule of 25 years and a cost of ¬£2.9 billion, a year later revised to 17 years at a cost of ¬£2.6 billion. Due to the uranium and plutonium held at the site, it is considered a security risk and there is a high police presence. The fuel elements, known as \\"exotics\\", are to be removed to Sellafield for reprocessing, starting in 2014 or 2015. In 2013 the detail design of the major project to decommission the intermediate level waste shaft was completed, and work was to begin later in the year. The work would include the recovery and packaging of over 1,500 tonnes of radioactive waste. As of 2013, the \\"interim end state\\" planned date had been brought forward to 2022‚Äì2025. In March 2014 firefighters extinguished a small fire in an area used to store low-level nuclear waste. ===PFR Fire=== On 7 October 2014 a fire on the PFR site led to a \\"release of radioactivity via an unauthorised route\\". The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) concluded that \\"procedural non- compliances and behavioural practices\\" led to the fire, and served an improvement notice on Dounreay Site Restoration Limited. In 2015 decommissioning staff expressed a lack of confidence in management at the plant and fear for their safety. In 2016 the task of dismantling the PFR core commenced. Plans were also announced to move about of waste Highly Enriched Uranium to the United States. On 7 June 2019, there was a low-level radioactive contamination incident that led to the evacuation of the site. A DSRL spokesman said: \\"There was no risk to members of the public, no increased risk to the workforce and no release to the environment\\". On 23 December 2019, the NDA announced completion of the transfer of all plutonium from Dounreay to Sellafield (the centre of excellence for plutonium management) where all significant UK stocks of this material are now held. On 20 August 2020 a new date for the site to become available for other uses was announced of 2333, as part of a new draft strategy for reclamation.[] ===Framework contracts=== In April 2019, Dounreay Site Restoration Limited (DSRL) awarded six framework contracts for decommissioning services at Dounreay. The total value of these contracts is estimated to be ¬£400 million. ==Vulcan Nuclear Reactor Testing Establishment (NRTE)== Vulcan NRTE entrance The Vulcan Naval Reactor Test Establishment (NRTE) (formerly HMS Vulcan) is a Ministry of Defence (MoD) establishment housing the prototype nuclear propulsion plants of the type operated by the Royal Navy in its submarine fleet. Originally it was known as the Admiralty Reactor Test Establishment (ARTE). For over 40 years Vulcan has been the cornerstone of the Royal Navy's nuclear propulsion programme, testing and proving the operation of five generations of reactor core. Its reactors have significantly led the operational submarine plants in terms of operation hours, proving systems, procedures and safety. The reactors were run at higher levels of intensity than those on submarines with the intention of discovering any system problems before they might be encountered on board submarines. Rolls-Royce, which designs and procures all the reactor plants for the Royal Navy from its Derby offices, operates Vulcan on behalf of the MoD and employs around 280 staff there, led by a small team of staff from the Royal Navy. Reactors developed include the PWR1 and PWR2. In 2011 the MoD stated that NRTE could be scaled down or closed after 2015 when the current series of tests ends. Computer modelling and confidence in new reactor designs meant testing would no longer be necessary. The cost of decommissioning NRTE facilities when they become redundant, including nuclear waste disposal, was estimated at ¬£2.1 billion in 2005. Its final reactor shut down on 21 July 2015, with post operational work continuing to 2022. In March 2020 it was reported that tenders were being issued to decontaminate and dismantle the reactor complex under a 10-year contract, ending in the creation of a \\"brownfield\\" site, which would be transferred to the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. This decommissioning programme would start in 2023, following the removal of all fuel to the NDA Sellafield site.The Press and Journal, March 13 2020. ===Dounreay Submarine Prototype 1 (DSMP1)=== The first reactor, PWR1, is known as Dounreay Submarine Prototype 1 (DSMP1). The reactor plant was recognised by the Royal Navy as one of Her Majesty's Submarines (HMS) and was commissioned as HMS Vulcan in 1963. It went critical in 1965. HMS Vulcan is a Rolls-Royce PWR 1 reactor plant and tested Cores A, B and Z before being shut down in 1984. In 1987, the plant was re-commissioned as LAIRD (Loss of Coolant Accident Investigation Rig Dounreay) a non-nuclear test rig, the only one of its kind in the world. LAIRD trials simulated loss of coolant accidents to prove the effectiveness of systems designed to protect the reactor in loss-of- coolant accidents. ===Shore Test Facility (STF)=== The second reactor, PWR2, is housed in the Shore Test Facility (STF), was commissioned in 1987, and went critical with Core G the same year. The plant was shut down in 1996, and work began to refit the plant with the current core, Core H, in February 1997. This work was completed in 2000 and after two years of safety justification the plant went critical in 2002. Vulcan Trials Operation and Maintenance (VTOM) (the programme under which Core H is tested) was completed and the reactor shut down on 21 July 2015. The reactor will be de-fuelled and examined, and post operational work will continue to 2022. The site would then be decommissioned along with facilities at neighbouring UKAEA Dounreay. In January 2012 radiation was detected in the reactor's coolant water, caused by a microscopic breach in fuel cladding. This discovery led to being scheduled to be refuelled early and contingency measures being applied to other Vanguard and Astute-class submarines, at a cost of ¬£270 million, before similar problems might arise on the submarines. This was not revealed to the public until 2014. ==See also== * Nuclear power in Scotland *Atomic Energy Research Establishment *Nuclear power in the United Kingdom *Energy policy of the United Kingdom *Energy use and conservation in the United Kingdom *RAF Dounreay ==References== ==External links== *Dounreay Site Restoration, official website *Dounreay - Future Plans, NDA *Shore Based Testing, Rolls- Royce Marine *Vulcan leads the way for Navy nuclear reactors, Navy News, 7 January 2003 *Vulcan takes on additional role, Navy News, 4 February 2003 *Dounreay, Scottish Parliament research note, 9 January 2001 *Dounreay - Fast Breeder, Caithness.Org *The Dounreay Sphere - Design and Construction (video - 25min 11sec), UKAEA, Dounreay TV *The Building of the Prototype Fast Reactor (video - 23min 44sec), UKAEA, Dounreay TV *Dounreay Decommissioning Tasks, UKAEA, December 2005 *Dounreay shaft grout to start, Edmund Nuttall, January 2007 *Latest reports on monitoring of beaches near Dounreay.

It is the northern terminus of the Victoria line and is the second of five stations on the Chingford branch of the Lea Valley lines operated by London Overground since 2015, from London Liverpool Street between and . The two lines have separate platforms at different levels. The station is in Travelcard Zone 3. It linked to station on the Gospel Oak to Barking line by a broad footpath, Ray Dudley Way. ==History== The station was opened by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) as Hoe Street in 1870 when a line was opened from to a temporary station called Shern Hall Street which was east of the Hoe Street station. The line to London, that the Chingford branch uses today was opened two years later in 1872 from Hall Farm Junction to Bethnal Green, with the branch also being extended north to Chingford in 1873. The GER amalgamated with several other railways to create the London and North Eastern Railway at the beginning of 1923. In 1948 the railways were nationalised and responsibility for operating the station fell to British Railways (Eastern Region). The line was electrified in the late 1950s with electric services commencing on 12 November 1960. Early services were formed of Class 305 EMUs but initial technical problems with these saw replacements by Class 302 and Class 304 EMUs. The station became an interchange station and the eastern terminus of the Victoria line with London Underground services starting on 1 September 1968; when station's present name was adopted. When originally approved in 1955, the terminus of the line was to be at Wood Street, a plan dropped in 1961 before construction of the line. The platforms for the Victoria line (like all stations on the Victoria line) are underground. On 31 May 2015, the station's Abellio Greater Anglia services were transferred to London Overground Rail Operations.TFL appoints London Overground operator to run additional services Transport for London 28 May 2014TfL count on LOROL for support Rail Professional 28 May 2014 ==DescriptionGeneral description=== The underground station, like many stations on the Victoria line, was built to a low budget. White ceiling panels were never fixed to the ceilings above the platforms; instead the steel tunnel segments were painted black and used to support the fixtures and fittings, cutting lighting levels. A concrete stairway sits between two escalators instead of a third; this economy caused a disruptive station closure for several weeks in 2004 when both escalators went out of service. The main entrance to the above-ground station is on the down side, opposite a bus station, which was revamped in summer 2004. Until August 2015 three staffed ticket windows opened, replaced by improved ticket machines. The entrance to the tube was revamped in early 2006. A smaller entrance is on the up line, facing a car park. Its ticket office is staffed mainly in peak hours. ===Major improvements=== A subway was built in 2005 under Selborne Road linking a new bus station with a new Victoria line ticket office. The new subway and ticket office was scheduled for spring 2005 but problems with insufficient power capacity to supply two new lifts, planning and contractual errors, delayed the opening until 19 November 2007. The lifts began operation in late 2008 and some building work took longer to finish. Ticket barriers control access to all platforms. A footpath link, called Ray Dudley Way, providing a shortcut to nearby , opened in August 2014. ==Services== Trains are operated by London Overground. The typical off-peak weekday service pattern is: *4 trains per hour (tph) to London Liverpool Street; *4 tph to Chingford. ==Connections== London Buses routes 20, 34, 55, 58, 69, 97, 212, 215, 230, 257, 275, 357, W11, W12, W15, W19 and 675 and night routes N26, N38 and N73 serve the station and bus station. ==GalleryVictoria line (London Underground)=== File:Walthamstow Central stn Victoria line look south.JPGNorth Victoria line platform looking West towards central London File:Walthamstow Central stn Victoria line look north.JPGSouth Victoria line platform looking East towards the buffer File:Walthamstow Central stn Victoria roundel.JPGVictoria line platform roundel ===Lea Valley lines (London Overground)=== File:Walthamstow Central Hoe Street.JPGWalthamstow Central railway station viewed west from the A112 overbridge File:Walthamstow Central stn mainline look north.JPGPlatforms looking eastwards File:Walthamstow Central stn mainline look south.JPGPlatforms looking westwards File:Walthamstow Central stn old building.JPGOriginal station building on the London-bound side ==References== Citations Sources * * * == External links == * Category:Victoria line stations Category:London Underground Night Tube stations Category:Tube stations in the London Borough of Waltham Forest Category:Railway stations in the London Borough of Waltham Forest Category:Former Great Eastern Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1870 Category:Walthamstow Category:Railway stations served by London Overground Category:1870 establishments in England Category:Railway stations located underground in the United Kingdom ","title":"Walthamstow Central station"},{"id":"823014","text":"Howell Thomas Heflin (June 19, 1921 ‚Äì March 29, 2005) was an American lawyer and politician who served in the United States Senate representing Alabama from 1979 to 1997.

For nearly two decades, he served as a law professor, while concurrently practicing law in Tuscumbia, Alabama. ==Political career== President Ronald Reagan in 1981 In 1970, Heflin was elected Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, serving from 1971 to 1977.Judicial History (PDF) In 1978, Heflin was elected to the United States Senate to succeed fellow Democrat John Sparkman, who had been Adlai E. Stevenson's running mate in the 1952 presidential election. Heflin won his party's nomination by defeating U.S. Representative Walter Flowers of Tuscaloosa, a longtime George C. Wallace ally. The 1966 Republican gubernatorial nominee, former U.S. Representative James D. Martin of Gadsden, announced that he would challenge Heflin. But Martin switched to a second Senate race for a two-year term created by the sudden death of Senator James B. Allen, leaving Heflin without a Republican opponent. In March 1981, President Reagan was shot during an assassination attempt by John Hinckley Jr. outside the Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C., Hinckley being brought to trial fourteen months afterward. Heflin espoused the view that the time between the incident and the trial was part of the need for an overhauling of the criminal justice system \\"so it can more efficiently and effectively deal with the rising epidemic of violent crime in this nation\\" and noted the shootings of Pope John Paul II and President of Egypt Anwar Sadat as incidents that had happened after the Reagan shooting yet had already seen the assailants be convicted and either jailed or executed. Heflin stated that the delays in bringing defendants to trial formed \\"contempt for the system\\" in addition to denouncing the delays as part of the problem, calling for the Senate to form a \\"Crime Caucus\\" as part of an attempt to \\"put aside petty partisan politics and unite in an effort to wage a successful war on crime.\\" In July 1981, Heflin announced he would introduce legislation calling for creation of a national court of appeals, and that such legislation would relieve the Supreme Court of some of its present burdens while increasing the national appellate capacity. The legislation was intended to also initiate a long-range study of the federal court system and call for major reforms in the American judiciary. Heflin noted that only 289 of the 4,242 petitions for hearings submitted to the Supreme Court in the previous year were granted and that a national appeals court would resolve feuds in the federal circuit courts. In 1984, Heflin won a second Senate term, handily defeating Republican former U.S. Representative Albert L. Smith Jr. of Birmingham, who had hoped to win by running on the reelection coattails of U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan. Heflin was reelected to a third term in 1990, defeating State Senator William J. Cabaniss, who later served as United States Ambassador to the Czech Republic under George W. Bush. Heflin did not run for reelection in 1996, and was succeeded by Republican Jeff Sessions. Heflin became chairman of the Select Committee on Ethics. While on the Ethics Committee, he led the prosecution against fellow Democratic senator Howard Cannon of Nevada for violations of Senate rules. As a conservative Democrat, he strongly opposed abortion rights and gun control. Heflin supported school prayer in public schools and opposed laws banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. He supported the Gulf War of 1991 and opposed cuts in defense spending. With Fritz Hollings of South Carolina, Heflin was one of only two Democrats in the Senate to vote against the Family and Medical Leave Act. He occasionally voted with Republicans on taxes. On other economic issues he was more allied with his party's populist wing. He voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and attempts to weaken enforcement of consumer protection measures. He strongly supported affirmative action laws. He voted against confirmation of Clarence Thomas to the United States Supreme Court, citing Thomas's lack of experience. In 1993 Heflin gave a memorable speech on the Senate floor in support of Senator Carol Moseley Braun's successful effort to deny renewal of a Confederate Flag design patent for the United Daughters of the Confederacy. Heflin spoke of his pride and love for his Confederate ancestors, his respect for the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and his conflict in breaking with them over this issue. But, he said, > we live in a nation that daily is trying to heal the scars that have > occurred in the past. We're trying to heal problems that still show negative > and ugly aspects in our world that we live in today, and perhaps racism is > one of the great scars and one of the most serious illnesses that we suffer > from still today. Heflin lived at his longtime residence in Tuscumbia until his death on March 29, 2005, of a heart attack. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth Ann, his son H. Thomas Jr., known as Tom, and two grandchildren. Heflin was the last Democrat to serve as a senator from Alabama until the swearing in of Doug Jones (winner of the December 2017 special election) on January 3, 2018, 21 years to the day after Heflin left the seat. Heflin had been a mentor to Jones, who worked for him as a senatorial aide. ==Honors== Memorial to Howell Heflin at the war memorial near the Colbert County Courthouse, Colbert County, Alabama The University of Alabama School of Law has honored Heflin with the \\"Howell Heflin Conference Room\\" in the Bounds Law Library. Tuscumbia named a street \\"Howell Heflin Lane\\" in his honor. The Howell Heflin Lock and Dam in Alabama is named in his honor. The Howell T. Heflin Seminar room in the Birmingham-Southern College Library is also named in his honor.

It is on the Victoria line of the London Underground and is the penultimate station on the eastern end of that line. Above ground, the station is on the Gospel Oak to Barking line of the London Overground, from (measured via Kentish Town and Mortimer Street Junction). It is in Travelcard Zone 3 and is the least-used station on the Victoria line, with 6.44 million passengers per year. It is the closest railway station to Walthamstow Wetlands. Ticket barriers control access to all platforms. Passengers using Oyster cards are required to tap on an interchange Oyster card reader when transferring between the two lines. ==History== The station was opened by the Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway on 9 July 1894, and was originally situated east of Blackhorse Road. Its opening changed the local area from a gentrified London suburb to industrial, with several works and units opening around Ferry Lane to the northwest.'Walthamstow: Introduction and domestic buildings', in A History of the County of Essex: Volume 6, ed. W R Powell (London, 1973), pp. 240-250. British History Online http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/essex/vol6/pp240-250 [accessed 18 June 2019]. The Victoria line station opened on 1 September 1968. It was the only station on the line with any new structures above ground level. The station was re-sited by British Rail on 14 December 1981, to provide better interchange with the Underground station.The Forgotten Stations of Greater London by J.Connor and B.Halford ==The station todayStructure=== The station contains two underground platforms for the Victoria line and two for the London Overground. Owing to budget restraints at the time of construction, the Underground station, like many stations on the Victoria line, was never completely finished to the standard of other lines. White ceiling panels were never fixed to the ceilings above the platforms; instead the steel tunnel segments were painted black and used to support the fixtures and fittings. This has had a detrimental effect on the lighting levels. ===Artwork=== The black horse tile motif at the tube station. There are two distinct works of art at the station, both depicting black horses, in reference to the station's name. One is in the form of a tile motif depicting a black horse on a white cameo against a light blue background, identical to the Victoria line's colour. It was designed by Hans Unger, who also did the tile motif at Seven Sisters tube station. The other is a mural of a black horse outside the station's entrance, by David McFall. ==Services== During peak periods, trains run approximately every two minutes on the Victoria line (up to 33 trains per hour) in both directions. The typical off-peak service for London Overground in trains per hour (tph) is: *4 tph westbound to Gospel Oak *4 tph eastbound to Barking From June 2016 until February 2017, services on the route were suspended whilst it was electrified; this project involved lowering track in several places, rebuilding bridges and lengthening platforms as well as installing overhead wires.\\"Eight-month closure planned for GOBLIN electrification\\"Global Rail News article 2 February 2016; Retrieved 7 June 2016 A replacement bus service was in operation for the duration of the closure period. ==Connections== London Bus routes 123, 158, 230, W11 and night route N73 serve the station. ==References== ==External links== Category:Victoria line stations Category:London Underground Night Tube stations Category:Tube stations in the London Borough of Waltham Forest Category:Railway stations in the London Borough of Waltham Forest Category:Former Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1894 Category:Railway stations served by London Overground Category:Walthamstow Category:Railway stations located underground in the United Kingdom ","title":"Blackhorse Road station"},{"id":"823038","text":"Seven Sisters is a London Overground and London Underground Victoria line station in the Seven Sisters area of the London Borough of Haringey, north London. The station has two entrances/exits, one on Tottenham High Road, and the other on Seven Sisters Road. The station is in Travelcard Zone 3. Seven Sisters lies between Finsbury Park and Tottenham Hale on the Victoria line and between Stamford Hill and Bruce Grove on the Lea Valley Cheshunt/Enfield Town Line from Liverpool Street, operated by London Overground. Abellio Greater Anglia also serve at peak times. It is a short distance from South Tottenham station on London Overground's Gospel Oak to Barking line. ==History== The station was constructed by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) on its Stoke Newington & Edmonton Railway line and opened on 22 July 1872. On 1 January 1878, the GER opened a branch line, the Palace Gates Line, from Seven Sisters station to Noel Park and later that year to Palace Gates (Wood Green) station. The Palace Gates Line was closed by British Rail in 1963 for passengers and 1964 for freight, with the branch line track and platforms at Seven Sisters later removed. On 24 July 1967 planning permission was granted to convert the station for London Underground use. The first section of the Victoria line opened on 1 September 1968 serving Seven Sisters, although a shared entrance and interchange facilities with the surface station were not opened until December 1968. The original GER entrance to the station was situated in West Green Road at the north end of the surface station, but the new combined entrance was opened in Seven Sisters Road at the south end on the site of a former wood merchants yard, connecting to the west end of the Victoria line platforms. The original (1872) entrance was closed at that time. The National Rail platforms are not at street level. Platform 1 (towards London Liverpool Street) is accessed by twin staircases. Platform 2 (towards Enfield Town & Cheshunt) has a staircase and an \\"up\\" escalator. A second entrance at the east end includes the main Victoria line ticket hall, and is accessed via subways on each side of High Road just north of the junction with Seven Sisters Road. There are three Victoria line platforms at Seven Sisters: with one platform (platform 4) reserved for services which terminate at the station to return to the depot or reverse back into central London, although a connection is available for trains to continue to Walthamstow Central. The section of Victoria line between Seven Sisters and Finsbury Park stations is the longest between adjacent stations in deep level tunnels on the London Underground network. During the planning phase of the Victoria line, thought was given to converting Manor House into a Victoria line station and diverting the Piccadilly line in new tunnels directly from Finsbury Park to Turnpike Lane via Harringay Green Lanes, but the idea was abandoned because of the inconvenience this would cause, as well as the cost. On 31 May 2015 the station and all services that call here, transferred from Abellio Greater Anglia to London Overground.TFL appoints London Overground operator to run additional services Transport for London 28 May 2014TfL count on LOROL for support Rail Professional 28 May 2014 Some Greater Anglia services are scheduled to call at this station at peak times. During summer 2015, there was no Victoria Line service between Seven Sisters and Walthamstow Central to facilitate works outside of Walthamstow station which would boost capacity along the line.

The station is an interchange station for three of the six lines on the DLR (-, Bank- and Tower Gateway-) making it one of the busiest stations on the network in terms of services. ==History== Long before the opening of the DLR in 1987, there had been three stations with the name Poplar. However, none was on the site of the current station. *Poplar railway station was on the London and Blackwall Railway between 8 July 1840 to 4 May 1926. This is near the site of Blackwall DLR station. *Poplar (East India Dock Road) railway station on the North London Railway was in use from 1866 until 1944. This is now the site of All Saints DLR station. * A third station named Poplar was constructed in 1851 but never opened. This was sited due south of the North London Railway station (now All Saints DLR), and due east of the present DLR depot. Poplar DLR station was opened on 21 August 1987, originally with just two platforms, being served only by the Stratford-Island Gardens branch of the DLR. As the DLR was expanded eastwards, the station was extensively remodelled, given two extra platforms and expanded to take two-car operation. On 28 March 1994 Poplar became the western terminus of the new Beckton branch, which opened the same day; on 31 July 1995, the line was extended west, joining Poplar with Westferry via a flying junction and enabling Beckton services to run to Tower Gateway. Bank to King George V (later Woolwich Arsenal) services through the station commenced on 2 December 2005. A trial as is part of Mayor of London Draft Transport Strategy called Adopt a Station‚Äô took place in 2018, which aims to encourage the use of public transport with space at the station will be given over to help publicise community events, classes, and workshops. It will also provide a platform for schools and groups to showcase art and it is hoped the scheme will make travelling through the station a more pleasant experience. ==Location== Poplar serves a junction in four directions: *Eastbound towards Beckton and Woolwich Arsenal (next station Blackwall) *Northbound towards Stratford (next station All Saints) *Southbound towards the Isle of Dogs and Lewisham (next station West India Quay) *Westbound towards Bank and Tower Gateway (next station Westferry). The central depot for the DLR is situated next to Poplar station and is accessed through a pair of tracks just east of Poplar. These feature the tightest curves in operation on the railway. ==Connections== ;London Buses While no bus routes directly serve the station presently, routes 15 and 115, prefix route D6 and night routes N15 and N551 do provide an indirect link to the station eastbound via Hale Street at Poplar Recreation Ground/Poplar Station bus stop on East India Dock Road A13. ;Crossrail When Crossrail opens, Poplar DLR station will be directly adjacent to the new Canary Wharf railway station. This will enable easy transfers between the two systems. ==See also== *Poplar DLR depot ==References== ==External links== *Docklands Light Railway website - Poplar station page *Map of Poplar, 1885. * Photograph of one of the platforms at Poplar Category:Docklands Light Railway stations in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1987 DLR station ","title":"Poplar DLR station"},{"id":"823061","text":"704 Hauser is an American sitcom television series and a spin-off of All in the Family (the final of several) that aired on CBS from April 11 to May 9, 1994. The series is built around the concept of a black family, the Cumberbatch Family, moving into the former Queens home of Archie Bunker years after Bunker had sold the house located at 704 Hauser Street. The All in the Family character Joey Stivic, Archie's grandson (played by Casey Siemaszko), makes a cameo in the first episode. ==Overview== Norman Lear created the series during the time when conservative talk radio was experiencing its initial upswing in popularity in the United States, particularly in the form of Rush Limbaugh. Lear felt that the time was right for a new show to explore some of the issues being discussed, and 704 Hauser was even more explicitly political than All in the Family. John Amos, a veteran of the earlier Lear sitcom Good Times (itself a spin-off of the All in the Family spin-off Maude), starred as Ernie Cumberbatch, while Lynnie Godfrey played his wife, Rose. T.E. Russell played their live-at-home son, Thurgood Marshall \\"Goodie\\" Cumberbatch. The show features a reversal of the original All in the Family formula. Ernie and Rose Cumberbatch are working class Democrats, while their son Goodie is a conservative activist and his girlfriend, Cherlyn Markowitz (Maura Tierney), is white and Jewish. The show attracted middling ratings, and was canceled after five episodes (with one episode remaining unaired). ==Episodes== ==Home media== The pilot episode, \\"Meet the Cumberbatchs\\", was included as a bonus feature on the All in the Family: The Complete Series DVD box set released by Shout!

The organization's current executive director is former Toronto politician Helen Kennedy. Past executive directors have included Gilles Marchildon, John Fisher and Kaj Hasselriis. Helen Kennedy is the first woman to head the organization. ==Overview== Egale's work includes lobbying for more equitable laws for LGBT people, intervening in legal cases that affect human rights and equality, and increasing public education and awareness by providing information to individuals, groups, and media. Egale has over 3,300 members including people in every province and territory of Canada. Founded in 1986 by political activist Les McAfee, Egale Canada was incorporated as a federal not-for-profit organization in 1995, with a focus on education, advocacy, litigation and expert consultation.http://egale.ca/index.asp?lang=E&menu;=2&item;=1152 The organization was initially named \\"Equality for Gays and Lesbians Everywhere\\". As they extended their efforts to include bisexual and transgender issues, they felt that the acronym was not inclusive enough, and therefore changed the name from the acronym E.G.A.L.E. to simply \\"Egale\\" (√©gale being the French word for \\"equal\\") in 2001. Egale Canada's partner organization, Egale Canada Human Rights Trust (ECHRT), was founded in 1995 as a charity dedicated to advancing LGBT human rights through education, research and community engagement. ==Focus areasRelationship recognition=== Egale successfully lobbied for the introduction and passage of Bill C-23, which amended 68 federal statutes to provide same-sex couples with the same legal status as that of opposite-sex married couples. They also supported union activities and lobbied the federal government in support of equal employment benefits to those in same-sex relationships; coordinated coalitions of equality groups in cases on same-sex pension benefits and equal funeral leave for same-sex families. Additionally, they have on two occasions challenged the legal definition of the word \\"spouse.\\" The first instance was when the group intervened before the Supreme Court of Canada to challenge the opposite-sex definition of \\"spouse\\" in the Old Age Security Act (Egan v. Canada). Although the challenge was unsuccessful, it did set a unanimous precedent by which sexual orientation was henceforth entered into the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms as a grounds for protection from discrimination. The second challenge was successful, and revised the opposite-sex definition of \\"spouse\\" in Ontario‚Äôs Family Law Act (M & H v Ontario) so that the right to common-law marriage extended to same-sex couples. They also helped convince Statistics Canada to include same-sex families in the nationwide census, and worked with LEGIT to advance equal immigration rights for gays and lesbians. ===Combating censorship and promoting freedom=== Egale intervened to support efforts to have LGBT pride officially proclaimed in many cities; supported community initiatives in response to the Calgary bathhouse raids; decried the heavy- handed censorship practices of Canada Customs and helped Little Sisters Bookstore win their court case. Egale has also supported freedom of speech for people with anti-gay points of view, including Albertan pastor Stephen Boissoin, who was found guilty by the Alberta Human Rights Commission of exposing gays to hatred.http://www.egale.ca/index.asp?lang=E&menu;=12&item;=1245 Part of the ruling was financial compensation paid to Egale as requested by the complainant Darren Lund (who is not homosexual), but Egale refused to accept the money. ===Helping create safer schools=== In 2007 Egale commissioned a survey of 3700 high school students from across Canada in order to gain data on the situation of LGBT students in Canadian schools and gain insight into the level of homophobia and transphobia in schools. The final report, entitled Every Class in Every School, was released in 2011.http://www.egale.ca/index.asp?lang&menu;=1&item;=1489 Responding to data discovered in the report which indicates that schools with a Gay-straight alliance are seen and felt as being more supportiveEvery Class in Every School Final Report on the First National Climate Survey on Homophobia, Biphobia, and Transphobia in Canadian Schools Egale created the mygsa.ca website. The site provides an online community and resources for students who wish to start or maintain a gay-straight alliance in their school. The site also provides resources for faculty and parents who wish to support LGBT students.http://mygsa.ca/locker Egale has also supported a number of legal challenges involving the rights of youth in the education system, especially the case of Marc Hall who wanted to bring a same-sex date to his prom; fought against the ban by the Surrey School Board of books depicting same-sex families. ===Human rights protection and combating hate crimes=== Egale successfully lobbied the federal government to add \\"sexual orientation\\" to the Canadian Human Rights Act to protect lesbians, gays and bisexuals from discrimination; lent support to many provincial and territorial efforts to have equal rights enshrined in legislation across the country; lobbied the Government to introduce more severe penalties for those convicted of gay- bashing and other hate crimes; supported the addition of \\"sexual orientation\\" to the grounds covered by hate propaganda legislation; intervened in the Nixon case to support the rights of transgender people. In 2007, responding to the suicide of an LGBT youth because of homophobic bullying, Egale created the Report Homophobic Violence, Period (RHVP) program in conjunction with the Toronto Police Service. RHVP is a reporting, public awareness and education program that focuses on youth ages 13 to 25 and addresses the issue of homophobic and transphobic bullying and violence.http://www.egale.ca/index.asp?lang=E&item;=1510 ===Community outreach and public education=== They developed fact sheets on current issues affecting the LGBT communities; established a Website and manages six e-mail discussion groups to help keep our communities informed across the country; hosted an historic national conference in Montreal (Rainbow Visions); testified before the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in support of diversity in Canada‚Äôs broadcasting policy and to oppose the limitation of access to lesbian and gay materials on the Internet through restrictive regulations; presented to the plenary session of the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna and participated in the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing. ==ControversiesImmigration issue=== Egale blamed the Conservative government for allegedly failing to help gay immigrants from countries that have anti-gay laws, such as Iran, Iraq, Malaysia, Jordan, Mexico and Nicaragua.Conservatives Failing Gay and Lesbian Immigrants ===Bill C-2=== In 2005, the organization was criticized by some of Canada's gay press for failing to submit a brief, after indicating an intention to do so, to the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights regarding the potential impact on LGBT communities of Bill C-2, a controversial piece of legislation that revised the age of sexual consent.

The population was estimated to be 370 in 1996, increasing to 388 at the 2011 Census. The parish church is the 13th-century church of St. John the Baptist, which was extensively remodelled in the 15th century. St. John the Baptist has a sister parish in Medfield, Massachusetts in the United States, the Church of the Advent. The town is named after Metfield. The Village has had no public house since 2007, when the only pub, The Duke William, closed. In May 2013 the pub re-opened as a successful Tea Room. During early 2014, the Tea Rooms expanded into a Bed and Breakfast along with a shop. During World War II an airfield was built just outside Metfield for use by the USAAF 491st Bomb Group and the 353d Fighter Group. On 15 July 1944 a bomb dump blew up, detonating over 1,000 tons of bombs and explosive, killing five men and wrecking five B-24 bombers.

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Stari Grad. Belgrade Fortress was declared a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and is protected by the Republic of Serbia. It is the most visited tourist attraction in Belgrade, with Skadarlija being the second. Since the admission is free, it is estimated that the total number of visitors (foreign, domestic, citizens of Belgrade) is over 2 million yearly. == Location == Belgrade Fortress is located on top of the 125.5 meter highStatistical Yearbook of Belgrade 2007 ‚Äì Topography, climate and environment ending ridge of the ≈†umadija geological bar. The cliff-like ridge overlooks the Great War Island () and the confluence of the Sava river into the Danube, and makes one of the most beautiful natural lookouts in Belgrade. It borders the neighborhoods of Dorƒáol (north and north-east), Stari Grad (east) and Kosanƒçiƒáev Venac (Savamala; south). It is bounded by 3 streets: Boulevard of Vojvoda Bojoviƒá, Tadeu≈°a Ko≈°ƒáu≈°ka, Pariska, plus the railway along the riverside. == History  Classical Antiquity === Belgrade Fortress is the core and the oldest section of the urban area of Belgrade. For centuries, the city population was concentrated only within the walls of the fortress, and thus the history of the fortress, until most recent times, reflects the history of Belgrade itself (see: Timeline of Belgrade history). The first mention of the city is when it was founded in the 3rd century BC as \\"Singidunum\\" by the Celtic tribe of Scordisci, who had defeated Thracian and Dacian tribes that previously lived in and around the fort. The city-fortress was later conquered by the Romans, was known as Singidunum and became a part of \\"the military frontier\\", where the Roman Empire bordered \\"barbarian Central Europe\\". Singidunum was defended by the Roman legion IV Flaviae, which built a fortified camp on a hill at the confluence of the Danube and the Sava rivers. In the period between 378 AD and 441 the Roman camp was repeatedly destroyed in the invasions by the Goths and the Huns. Legend says that Attila's grave lies at the confluence of the Sava and the Danube (under the fortress). In 476 Belgrade again became the border between the empires: the Western Roman Empire and Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire), and the Slav-Avar State in the north. The Celtic fortification was a primitive one, located on top of Terazije ridge, above the confluence of the Sava into the Danube, where the fortress still stands today. Celts also lived in small, open and fortified settlements around the fort, called opidums. Since it is not known for sure where the Celtic fort was, some historians suggest that it was rather close to the necropolises in Karaburma and Rospi ƒÜuprija. Celtic settlements belonged to the La T√®ne culture. The original military camp was probably occupied by the soldiers from the Legio VIII Augusta from 46 AD to 69. Early Singidunum reached its height with the arrival of Legio IV Flavia Felix which was transferred to the city in 86 AD and remained there until the mid 5th century. The presence of Legio IV prompted the construction of a square-shaped castrum (fort), which occupied Upper Town of today's fortress. Construction began at the turn of the 2nd century AD as since the early 100s, Legio IV Flavia Felix became permanently stationed in Singidunum. At first, the fortress was set up as earthen bulwarks and wooden palisades, but soon after, it was fortified with stone as the first stone fort in Belgrade's history. The remains can be seen today near the northeastern corner of the acropolis. The legion also constructed a pontoon bridge over the Sava, connecting Singidunum with Taurunum. Rectangular castrum covered what is today the Upper Town and the Kalemegdan Park. The castrum had tall walls, built from the white Ta≈°majdan limestone and spread over the area of to , being shaped as an irregular rectangle (approximately ). Stambol Gate. === Middle Ages === The Byzantine Emperor Justinian I rebuilt the fortress around 535. In the following centuries the fortress suffered continuous destruction under the Avar sieges. The Slavs (Serbs) and Avars had their \\"state union\\" north of Belgrade with the Serbs and other Slavic tribes finally settling in the Belgrade area as well as the regions west and south of Belgrade in the beginning of the 7th century. The name Belgrade (or Beograd in Serbian), which, not just in Serbian but in most Slavic languages, means a \\"white town\\" or a \\"white fortress\\", was first mentioned in AD 878 by Bulgarians. The fortress kept changing its masters: Bulgaria during three centuries, and then the Byzantines and then again Bulgarians. The fortress remained a Byzantine stronghold until the 12th century when it fell in the hands of the newly emerging Serbian state. It became a border city of the Serbian Kingdom, later Empire with Hungary. The Hungarian king B√©la I gave the fortress to Serbia in the 11th century as a wedding gift (his son married the Serbian princess Jelena), but it remained effectively part of Hungary, except for the period 1282‚Äì1319. Zindan Gate After the Serbian state collapsed following the Battle of Kosovo, Belgrade was chosen as the capital of Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá in 1402. Major work was done to the ramparts which were encircling a big thriving town. The lower town at the banks of the Danube was the main urban center with a new built Orthodox cathedral. The upper town with its castle was defending the city from inland. Belgrade remained in Serbian hands for almost a century. After the Despot's death in 1427, it had to be returned to Hungary. An attempt by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in 1456 to conquer the fortress was prevented by Janos Hunyadi (Siege of Belgrade), saving Hungary from Ottoman dominion for 70 years. === Early Modern === In 1521, 132 years after the Battle of Kosovo, the fortress, like most parts of the Serbian state, was conquered by the Turks and remained (with short periods of the Austrian and Serbian occupation), under the rule of the Ottoman Empire until the year 1867, when the Turks withdrew from Belgrade and Serbia. During the short period of Austrian rule (1718‚Äì1738), the fortress was largely rebuilt and modernized. It witnessed the Great Serbian Migration in the 17th century and two Serbian Uprisings in the 19th century, during the Turkish Period. Inner Stambol Gate During the Austrian occupation of northern Serbia 1717‚Äì39, several hospitals were established in Belgrade. The City hospital of Saint John was built within the fortress walls, but its exact location is not known. Emperor Charles VI signed the Belgrade City Statute in 1724 (\\"Proclamation on organizing German Belgrade\\"), which mentions city hospital, city pharmacy, medics and midwives. The German municipality had low incomes so it had to ask the state for help and beneficence. The hospital is mentioned in the 1728 Census. It was a hospital already in 1719, later becoming the residence of Thomas Berger, the head of the hospital. After his death, his daughter continued to reside in the building. The hospital (Stattspital) was moved to another location, into the newly constructed building in 1724. A small church was built next to it. This new hospital was quite small, with only 2 rooms, a kitchen and a basement, so it way not be the same city hospital. Lazaret or a quarantine hospital is not mentioned in the documents, but it is safe to presume that it had to be formed during the viral outbreaks, as was usual in the time. The procedure in case of outbreaks was probably analog to the existing procedure in Buda, the capital of Hungary. Today unidentified disease ravaged Belgrade in 1730. Viral epidemic killed a lot of people. During the course of only two weeks, just the Jesuits buried 220 people and themselves lost 3 missionaries. The extremely massive plague outbreak hit the city in October 1738. As the Austrian army retreated in front of the advancing Turks, numerous civilians fled to the fortress, many of them being contagious. Having so many people in a cramped space, triage was not possible so the plague spread quickly. There are reports of the dead lying in the streets for days as there was no one to bury them. The Austrian garrison was decimated and the corpses of the soldiers who died of plague were burned with their personal properties. Jak≈°iƒá's Tower After Austria lost the Austro-Turkish War of 1737‚Äì1739, northern Serbia, including Belgrade, was returned to the Turks. One of the provisions of the 1739 Treaty of Belgrade stated that Austria had to demolish all the fortifications and military and civilian building it had constructed during the occupation. Many Baroque buildings were demolished within the fortress. However, Austria didn't demolish the buildings outside of the fortress walls. That way, the House at 10 Cara Du≈°ana Street, built 1724‚Äì1727, in the neighborhood of Dorƒáol survived, being today the oldest house in Belgrade. The 1837 plague outbreak almost brought to the war between the ruling prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá and the Ottomans in the fortress. The outbreak began in Ottoman Empire in 1836, which had no medical protocols of any kind at the time, and prince Milo≈° blocked the borders immediately imposing the mandatory quarantine. A group of plague infected Ottoman nizams on the way to Belgrade was halted at the border in Aleksinac and placed in the quarantine, but majority of them fled and continued to Belgrade, spreading the plague on its path (Ra≈æanj, Paraƒáin, Jagodina, ƒÜiƒáevac) and ultimately reaching the fortress in the spring of 1837. The prince ordered full and strong siege of the fortress by the Serbian guardsmen, cutting the fortress off completely for six weeks. The pasha complained and threatened from inside the fortress, initially hiding and denying the disease, but the fortress Ottomans were reluctant to start military skirmish in this condition. The besieging was successful as the plague never spread to Belgrade. Four outer city gates, with the adjoining walls and ramparts were demolished from 1862 (Sava, Vidin and Varo≈° gates) to 1866 (Stambol Gate). After the Ottomans fully evacuated the inner fortress in 1867, Serbian troops took over, but as the state was still only autonomous (full independence was achieved in 1878), Serbia was only to \\"manage it\\" and was not acknowledged as the proprietor of the fortress by the neighboring Austria-Hungary. First action by the Serbian authorities, just 5 days after the Ottomans left in April 1867, was to rebuild the Ru≈æica Church. After the Ottoman withdrawal, newspapers in Austro-Hungary continuously published stories, backed by the military experts, that the fortress became strategically obsolete and that, having no value of any kind, Austrian army could destroy it in 24 hours. In the autumn of 1867 citizens were awaken by the heavy artillery fire. Ruling prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá sent two batteries to the fortress (where modern Monument of Gratitude to France is) and ordered them to fire at the fortress wall where the old wooden bridge was located. A barrage fire of 300 salvos from De Bange cannons shelled the fortress during the entire day. It remained unclear why the prince ordered this: he decided to demolish the fortress completely, as such stories spread among the citizens; he wanted to show to the Austrians that the fortress has its values and importance, and that it can't be destroyed in a day (despite all the shelling, only of rampart was destroyed); or he simply did it to spite the Austrians. The shelling also disturbed the citizens of Zemun, across the Sava, which was part of Austro-Hungary at the time, and some of the grenades which missed the target hit Austro-Hungarian soil, so the imperial government sent an official diplomatic note to Serbia, protesting the shelling and reminding the prince he is only a \\"caretaker\\" of the fortress. After the takeover of the fortress, Serbian forces kept finding parts of the gallows, chains, gibbets and impalement stakes in the dungeons, used previously by the Ottomans to torture the prisoners. Official reports by the Serbian army hold claims by the soldiers of the \\"ghoulish, headless and limbless wraiths\\" and other abominations roaming the fortress. The army issued an order that, despite there was no enemy anymore, all guards must keep watch \\"at least in pairs\\". Mihailo's successor, prince and later king Milan Obrenoviƒá, ordered the leveling of the terrain in the eastern sections of the fortress and planting of the greenery and trees, which in time developed into the Kalemegdan Park. === Modern === While it was inhabited, the fortress formed one of the quarters in the administrative division of Belgrade. It was called Grad, and translated in the foreign languages as \\"fortress\\". According to the censuses, it had a population of 2,219 in 1890, 2,281 in 1895, 2,777 in 1900, 2,396 in 1905 and 454 in 1910. Kalemegdan was the location of the second airport in Serbia, after one in the neighborhood of Banjica from 1910. A field in the Donji Grad was adapted for planes in January 1911. It was situated along the bank of the Sava river, from the old Turkish bath (modern Planetarium) to the mouth of the Sava into the Danube. One of the flight pioneers, Edvard Rusjan, died in an airplane crash after taking off from this field and being hit by the gust of ko≈°ava on 9 January 1911. Remains of Rusjan's plane were originally exhibited in Donji Grad and his funeral was one of the largest recorded in Belgrade. Surviving rib of this airplane became the first exhibit in the predecessor of the modern Aeronautical Museum Belgrade. Today, the area is used by the parachutists and paragliders and as the location of the air shows for sports and ultra-light aviation. The fortress and the park were damaged during World War I. Serbian army had no proper weaponry to fight the Austro-Hungarian gunboats, so they freely fired at the city from the Sava. The city was especially damaged during the heavy bombardment in 1914-1915. Diplomat and author described it in 1914: \\"Kalemegdan is \\"trimmed\\", the trees in the park are battered, the ancient ramparts of Singidunum crushed, all being hit by the heavy, modern artillery, from precisely measured distance and even more precisely unmeasured hatred\\". In 1928, building company \\"≈†umadija\\" proposed the construction of the cable car, which they called \\"air tram\\". The project was planned to connect Zemun to Belgrade Fortress, via Great War Island. The interval of the cabins was set at 2 minutes and the entire route was supposed to last 5 minutes. The project was never realized, but the idea of the cable car was revived in the 21st century. During his visit to the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Yugoslav prime minister Milan Stojadinoviƒá was fascinated by the objects built for the games, especially by the grandiose Olympic Stadium. He instigated the Yugoslav Olympic Committee to nominate Belgrade as the host of the 1948 Olympics and invited Werner March, architect of the Berlin stadium, to visit Belgrade and design objects for the games. March came to Belgrade in May 1938 and suggested the Fortress' Lower Town as the location for the Olympic complex. Without architectural design competition or bidding, Stojadinoviƒá's government accepted his idea and gave him carte blanche regarding the design. The project was finished in 1939 and the architectural model was exhibited in October 1940 at the \\"Exhibition of the new German architecture\\" in the German pavilion at the Belgrade Fair. In the early 1940, March began the preparatory works, as he also planned the partial remodeling of the fortress outside of the sports complex, too. He incited archaeological survey and invited German architectural historian Daniel Krencker to study the excavations. Within the scopes of the Nazi expansion of the megaprojects, and augmentation of the German historic role and importance in this region, Krencker praised March's project as the \\"artistic dream, which represents rare and major German cultural act which will contribute to the old German glory of Belgrade\\". Just few days after German scientists left the fortress, Germany attacked Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941. Olympic complex was pushed aside, shifting the focus of the Germans to the archaeological exploration of the fortress during the war. The fortress suffered further damage during the First and the Second World Wars. After almost two millennia of continuous sieges, battles and conquests, the fortress is today known as the Belgrade Fortress. The present name of Kalemegdan Park derives from two Turkish words, kale (fortress) and meydan (field), literally meaning \\"fortress field\\". After World War II, before skiing facilities were built on the mountains further from Belgrade, the slopes of Kalemegdan (so as of Banovo Brdo, Ko≈°utnjak and Avala), were used by Belgraders for skiing. == Archaeology  Words War II === Gate of Charles VI. Already in April 1941, professor and major was appointed to the Referat for the Protection of the Cultural Values in Serbia. He saved numerous cultural objects in Serbia, which won him praise even from some Serbian historians after the war. On 20 October 1941 the Lower Town was fenced on his orders of keeping and protecting the fortress. He also began archaeological digging. However, the right to dig in the fortress was asked from both the pseudo-scientific organization Ahnenerbe and the Main Work Group Southeast of the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce. Pressured financially and politically, von Reiswitz felt he must side with one of them, so he arranged the participation of Ahnenerbe with organization's head Walther W√ºst in October 1941. Based on this, collaborationist Minister for Education and Religion Velibor Joniƒá issued the \\"permit on monopoly\\" to Ahnenerbe's Secretary General Wolfram Sievers in February 1942. Austrian prehistorian was selected to conduct the survey, but he was killed in May 1942 near Kharkiv, Ukraine, before reaching Belgrade. He was replaced with Wilhelm Unverzagt, director of the Berlin's Museum for Prehistory and Early History. Joined by Sievers and Herbert Jankuhn, Heinrich Himmler's close associate, Unverzagt began targeted digging, searching for the material proof to confirm the German idea of transforming Belgrade into Prinzeugenstadt. He specifically searched for the monumental gate at the entry into the Lower Town, built during the Nicolas Doxat's rebuilding of Belgrade under the orders of Prince Eugene of Savoy in the 1720s and 1730s. The gate was named after the Holy Roman Emperor from that period, Charlies VI. Already on 15 July 1941, secretary in the Reich Ministry of the Interior Wilhelm Stuckart sent memo, asking for Belgrade to be transformed into the \\"Reich's Fortress\\". It was to be connected military with the copper and gold Bor mines and the Danube's Iron Gates gorge, to create the Banat area protection zone. This zone was intended to become Eugenia, or Prinz Eugen's District, where Danube Swabians were to settle and expand. The digging lasted through 1942 and 1943, when it was stopped after the Allied bombing of Belgrade began. By 1943, the Germans completely rebuilt the Gate of Charles VI, in greatest detail. Reconstruction included the cartouche with the initials of the emperor on the capital from the outer side, and the supposed coat-of-arms of never-existing Tribalia, on the inner side (boar with an arrow pierced through the head). As the motive of this coat-of-arms appeared in medieval Serbian seals and was adopted as part of the Serbian coat-of-arms after First Serbian Uprising in 1804, it was meant to show the incorporation of Serbia into the western empire. The gate was damaged already during the heavy Allied Easter bombing in April 1944. It is not known was Ahnenerbe searching for something specifically or just wanted to falsify the route by which Aryans reached Germany from Middle East. Some surviving documents show that they discovered remains of Celtic and Gothic settlements, a trench from the Roman period and relics from the Austrian rule after the conquest of Eugene of Savoy. Some sources claim that after the bombing started, documentation and part of the artifacts were transported to Lebus, in Germany, and are considered to be lost. Others claim that the entire material was stored in the Belgrade City Museum. What is known for sure is that during the \\"terrain cleaning\\" in 1941-1942, the Germans completely destroyed the foundations of the Austrian artillery barrack built in the 1723-1736 period. === Post war === On 29 February 1952 city adopted the \\"Decision on protection, adaptation and maintenance of the people's park of Kalemegdan\\" which set the borders of the protected areas as the rivers of Danube and Sava and the streets of Tadeu≈°a Ko≈°ƒáu≈°kog and Pariska. In 1962, Belgrade's Institute for the cultural monuments protection expanded the zone to several blocks across the streets. Detailed plan on Kalemegdan from 1965 provided that, despite the immense archaeological value that lies beneath the fortress ground, basically only what was discovered by that time can be explored, restored or protected. That caused the problem both for the expansion of the park but even more for the further exploration of the fortress' underground. Best example is the Lower Town where neither the park fully developed nor the remains of the former port, which was located there, are visible. The area of the fortress is . By 2000, only 5% of that area was archaeologically surveyed, and by 2010 that number rose to 12% or . Based on the findings so far, it is estimated that during the rule of despot Stefan Lazareviƒá in the first half of the 15th century, when Belgrade became capital of Serbia, the city within the fortress had 5,600 to 12,000 inhabitants. Archaeological examinations were done on the following locations: * Upper Town in the inner fortress; surveyed 1948‚Äì2009; found remains belong to the Prehistory, Antiquity, Middle Ages and Turkish- Austrian period * waterfront rampart in Lower Town 1963‚Äì2010; Middle Ages and Turkish-Austrian period * Kalemegdan Park 1973‚Äì2010; antiquity, Middle Ages and Turkish-Austrian period * Belgrade Zoo 1988; antiquity, Middle Ages and Turkish-Austrian period In September 1969 major discoveries were announced. The appearance of the Lower Town was almost completely changed after the excavation. The medieval cobblestone was uncovered, so as the old ramparts and gates. In the process, the Lower Town was made more accessible to the visitors, including the new stairway and reconstruction of the part of the medieval rampart. In the Upper Town, four large, massive pillars from the period of despot Stefan Lazareviƒá (15th century) were discovered. They are remains of the medieval bridge which was located in front of the main entry into the inner fort of the city. The fort was surrounded by the deep trench. It was previously known that an inner, bascule bridge existed within the fortress, which survived until the 17th century, but its exact location and type of construction were unknown. The explored sections after 2000 include the access downhill path to the Small Staircase in Kalemegdan Park, the bastion on the Sava slope, the gates of King, Sava, Dark and Karaƒëorƒëe, the Great Ravelin, etc. During the 2017 reconstruction of the Mehmed Pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá's Fountain, next to Defterdar's Gate in the Gornji Grad, several archaeological discoveries were made. Remnants of the Roman castrum, two urns from the Bronze Age and remains of the Neolithic object were discovered. The findings were conserved and reburied. == Features == Belgrade Fortress is generally divided into four sections. The four sections, two of which make the fortress itself (Donji and Gornji Grad) and two make Kalemegdan park today, were divided by the Tsarigrad Road, on the location of modern pedestrian path next to the Cvijeta Zuzoriƒá Art Pavilion. === Lower Town === Ru≈æica Church Donji Grad (–î–æ—ö–∏ –ì—Ä–∞–¥); occupies the slope towards the riversides, from the top spot (ridge where \\"The Victor\\" is). Between the lowest section and the Danube is Kula Neboj≈°a (\\"Impregnable, Fearless, or Daredevil Tower\\"), which has been turned into a museum of the Greek revolutionary Rigas Feraios, who was strangled by the Turks in this tower and his corpse thrown into the Danube. Donji Grad, like the neighboring Savamala, frequently suffers from flooding, and Kula Neboj≈°a suffered extensive damage during the major floods of 2006. The Orthodox churches of Ru≈æica (former Austrian gun depot) and Sveta Petka are also located in this area, as is the Belgrade Planetarium. The modern church of Sveta Petka was projected by architect Momir Korunoviƒá. Construction began in the first half of the 1930s, on the location of an old chapel. It was consecrated on 27 October 1937, the feast day of Parascheva of the Balkans, called Petka in Serbian. During the tenure of mayor Dragan ƒêilas (2008‚Äì13), the idea of expanding the zoo to Donji Grad, which it occupied prior to the World War II, resurfaced, but the experts were against it. The urban plan for the fortress from 1965 already projected the complete relocation of the zoo outside of the fortress, to some suburban locations, which in later plans included Veliko Blato, Stepin Lug or Jelezovac. The expansion of the zoo would cut the pedestrian communication between the Danube's and Sava's parts of the fortress, which was already cut in 1949 but was restored in 2009 with the reconstruction and opening of the Sava Gate. Also, it would prevent the exploration of Donji Grad, which is still largely unexplored and leave the Gate of Charles VI, a masterpiece of Balthasar Neumann, within the zoo itself. As of 2017, the zoo was not relocated but the idea of expansion was dropped, too. === Upper Town === Despot Stefan Tower Gornji Grad (–ì–æ—Ä—ö–∏ –ì—Ä–∞–¥), the upper section of fortress, turned into a park, with beautiful promenades and the statue of \\"The Victor\\" (Serbian: Pobednik), the so-called \\"Roman well\\" (Serbian: Rimski bunar), actually built by the Austrians, the Popular Observatory (since 1963) in the Despot Stefan Tower, the t√ºrbe (tomb) of Damad Ali Pasha, Mehmed Pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá's Fountain, tennis and basketball courts, etc.  Gunpowder magazine (ca 1720s)  Also adapted for visits is the Great Austrian gunpowder magazine, built during the Austrian occupation of Belgrade 1718‚Äì39, after they destroyed the old one during the 1717 Siege of Belgrade. They directly hit the magazine with a cannonball and the explosion which followed allowed the Austrians to capture the city. The object is located below the tall rampart. The magazine is today embellished with the artifacts from the Roman period which were discovered in or around the fortress: tombstone stelae, monuments, altars and the Sarcophagus of Jonah, which originates from the 3rd century AD. It was arranged and opened for visitors in 2014. One of the Roman marble monuments, exhibited since 2012, was the so called Herkulanka (after Herculaneum, where first such sculptures were discovered in the 18th century). They were usually honorary representations of important women. Estimated to be work of some local sculptor to represent one of the more important female residents of Singidunum, it was made in c.300 and was found close to the Military Museum. The represented woman is rich, in heavily draped chiton, with the himation mantle wrapped over the arm and head. In May 2020, there was a break in the magazine's lapidarium, and the Herkulanka was vandalized and broken.  Roman well (ca 1720s)  The present facility, called the Roman Well, is neither Roman nor a (water) well. It is located along the southwest rampart of the Upper Town, in the vicinity of the Pobednik monument and the \\"King's Gate\\". An underground object existed during the mediaeval period and is referenced by Constantine of Kostenets during the rule of Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá, in the first half of the 15th century. It apparently was a dungeon as it was mentioned during the 1456 Siege of Belgrade when 30 Hungarian conspirators died in it after their scheme to let the Turks into the fortress and surrender the city to them was thwarted. They were to be paid by the Turks, but were discovered and dropped into the pit with ropes. They were left there without food and after they began losing their minds from hunger, they were thrown knives to kill each other. Turkish traveler Evliya √áelebi in 1660 wrote about the object as the grain silo. Entrance to the Roman well After the Austrians occupied the northern Serbia in 1717, it was obvious that there is a problem of providing water for the city within the fortress. Main sources were two large rivers, Danube and Sava, but as Belgrade was quite often under siege or a battleground, it wasn't practical as the rivers would become unreachable during the sieges so they searched for an alternative. Within the scopes of a massive construction and reconstruction of Belgrade in the Baroque manner, from 1717 to 1731 a present facility was dug and a complex wooden mechanism was installed to lift the water up from the pit of . It was designed by Balthasar Neumann. Austrians originally intended to dig a proper water well. They descended to , which is below the water level in the Sava, but found no water and actually hit the impervious rock layer. Then they decided to adapt it into the cistern and to conduct all surface water into it. The mechanism was manually operated, worked on the lever principle and had 12 segments, or pistons, which all worked at the same time when operated. Water was then \\"climbing\\", being poured from one vessel into another. Being made of wood, it got rotten and completely disappeared in time, but sometimes it is mentioned as the beginning of the \\"industrial period\\" in Belgrade. The copy of the schematics is still being kept in the library of the Matica Srpska in Novi Sad. Neumann also constructed a double spiral staircase which descends down the shaft and based it on the staircase in the Saint Peter Well in Orvieto, Italy. The diameter of the shaft is . The staircase has 212 steps and there is a small corridor at the bottom which connects two sections of the staircase, but it is usually flooded. On Austrian maps, it is named the Great Well, but when Serbian rebels liberated Belgrade from the Ottomans in the early 19th century they gradually named it the Roman Well as the common belief at the time was that all old buildings were Roman. In 1940 the Yugoslav Royal Army emptied the well, measured it and cleaned it. Because of that, during the World War II an urban myth spread through Belgrade claiming that the gold from the National bank of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was hidden in the well. German occupation forces sent three divers to check the bottom of the well, but all three disappeared. Some of the Yugoslav soldiers apparently carved a number \\"1940\\" near the bottom of the well.Roman well In 1954 a man threw his mistress into the well. Police wanted to prove that he killed her so the divers were dispatched to find the body, but they failed. Still, her body resurfaced ten days later. This story served as an inspiration for Du≈°an Makavejev when he wrote and directed the movie Love Affair, or the Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator in 1967. In 1964 Alfred Hitchcock visited the well and praised the \\"ambience\\". In 1967‚Äì1968, new exploration of the object was conducted. The divers discovered that the bottom is full of sludge and retrieved a number of skeletons, several animal ones and two human. In 1987 the divers explored whether there is a connection between the well and the Sava, but found no tunnel. The bottom was flat, there was one park bench in the water and a huge number of coins. The Roman Well served as an inspiration for another , which was nominated by Serbia for an Oscar in 2002. During the 2006 dive, a miniature, long amphipoda, previously undiscovered in Serbia, was found. It was closed in 2007, reconstructed and reopened in March 2014, but as of 2017 the upper section is open for visitors while the descent is forbidden due to the safety reasons. Divers explored it again in November 2017. The bottom wasn't flat anymore as the bench and coins were covered with a thick layer of some of construction waste, iron bars, reflector lights, wired trash bins, etc, which all made the well shallower. Cans, plastic bottles and lids were floating on the water, while a pile of new coins formed. The divers suggested that the well should be cleaned at least once a year. Still, the water was unusually clear, with artificial reflector light it was transparent all the way to the bottom, or and had a temperature of . After 300 years, speleothems began to form near the bottom of the well. Existence of another water well, sort of a \\"twin\\" of the Roman well, is not widely known today. This well, built on the same principle and being about the same depth, is located away from the fortress, below the modern Monument to Vuk Karad≈æiƒá in the Vukov Spomenik neighborhood.  Damad Ali Pasha's t√ºrbe (1784)  Damad Ali Pasha's t√ºrbe The t√ºrbe is located on the central plateau of the Upper Town and is one of the few remaining monuments of Islamic architecture in Belgrade. It was named after Damad Ali Pasha, a Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire 1713‚Äì16, during the reign of Sultan Ahmed III. The mausoleum, however, is younger. It was built in 1784 over the grave of Izzet Mehmed Pasha, another Grand Vizier and a muhafiz, or governor, of Belgrade. The t√ºrbe was badly damaged during the First Serbian Uprising, so the Ottoman governor of Serbia, Marashli Ali Pasha, reconstructed it in 1818‚Äì19 and dedicated it to Damad Ali Pasha. Another two muhafiz, this time administering only the fortress as Serbia gained autonomy, were buried in the t√ºrbe: Selim Sirri Pasha in 1847 and Hasan Pasha in 1850. The mausoleum is made of stone, with a regular hexagonal base. The sides are long, it is tall with a diameter of . A thorough renovation began in May 2017 and should be finished by October. The wiring and the roof are replaced, the floor was drained and the inner and outer conservation was done. Old roof tiles were broken so the water poured inside. The roof tiles, which were not the original roof cover, were replaced with the lead cover and new, modern roof tiles, rotten wooden floor was replaced with the brick slabs and the wooden covering of the tomb was also replaced.  Bunker (1948‚Äì1949)  In 1948, after the Informbiro resolution and the ensuing Tito‚ÄìStalin split, a construction of the defensive bunker began on the fortress. In the process, the thick rampart of the original Neboj≈°a Tower was discovered. It was destroyed and by 1949 the bunker which covers was finished. The tallest point of the bunker is the cannon dome which was used for the artillery and military units. Abandoned later, it was adapted for the tourists and opened in December 2012. It has parts of the authentic inventory from the 1950s: safety doors, beds, ventilation, water tanks, etc.  Basketball monument (2018)  On 12 December 2018, a monument officially called \\"Monument to the Founding Fathers of Serbian and Yugoslav Basketball School\\" was dedicated. The date was symbolic, as it also marked 95 years since the first basketball arrived in Serbia and 70 years since the founding of the basketball association. The monument is located in a small park area between the basketball courts of \\"Partizan\\" and \\"Crvena Zvezda\\". As written on the inscription, the monument is dedicated to the members of the Yugoslavia national basketball team which qualified for the 1950 FIBA World Championship in Argentina. Four players from this team became members of the FIBA Hall of Fame: Neboj≈°a Popoviƒá, Aleksandar Nikoliƒá, Radomir ≈†aper and Borislav Stankoviƒá. The sculpture was built on the initiative of the former basketball player Nata≈°a Kovaƒçeviƒá. The monument was designed by sculptor Rado≈° Radenkoviƒá, symbolizes \\"fight for global affirmation\\" and represents three stylized arms reaching for a basketball. === Great Kalemegdan Park === Military Museum Veliki Kalemegdanski park (–í–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏ –ö–∞–ª–µ–º–µ–≥–¥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏ –ø–∞—Ä–∫) occupies the southern corner of fortress, with geometrical promenades, the Military Museum, the Museum of Forestry and Hunting, and the Monument of Gratitude to France. At the location of the Monument of Gratitude to France there was a monument to Karaƒëorƒëe which was dedicated on 21 August 1913, a work of Pa≈°ko Vuƒçetiƒá. There was a relief with various figures on the sides of the pedestal and Karaƒëorƒëe's grandson, king Peter I of Serbia attended the dedication. During the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Belgrade in World War I, the Austrians planned to erect the bronze monument to their emperor, Franz Joseph I on that very spot so they melted the Karaƒëorƒëe's monument to reuse the bronze. When the Franz Joseph monument was being shipped to Belgrade in 1918, Serbian forces captured the ship and confiscated the statue. It was later melted into three church bells, largest of which still tolls from the belltower of the Ru≈æica Church today.  Gondola lift  In August 2017 the construction of the gondola lift, which would connect Kalemegdan with U≈°ƒáe was announced by the city government for 2018. Construction was confirmed in March 2018 when the idea of a pedestrian bridge was dropped after it has been described as \\"complicated\\" and \\"unstable\\". On the Kalemegdan side, the station will be dug into the hill, 1m (3 ft 3in) below the fortress' Sava Promenade. There is a cave below the projected station, so there is a possibility that the cave will be adapted for visitations and connected to the future gondola station by an elevator. On the U≈°ƒá–µ side, the starting point will be next to the Skate Park, across the U≈°ƒáe Tower. The entire route is long, of which will be above the Sava river itself. Estimated cost is ‚Ç¨10 million and duration of works 18 months. Already existing criticism of the project continued, from the officially used name (gondola instead of a traditional Serbian ≈æiƒçara) and chosen location, to the route, especially the Kalemegdan station which is a collapsible locality above the cave, in the area already prone to mass wasting. Park of the Non-Aligned Countries in the neighborhood of Kosanƒçiƒáev Venac was proposed as the better solution. Cutting of 47 trees in the park, because of the gondola lift began in March 2019. The pine trees were 50 to 60 years old. With an enlarged price of ‚Ç¨15 million and unified opposition to the project by the environmentalists, architects and urbanists, with additional cutting of over 100 trees in U≈°ƒáe park across the river, this prompted popular protests. Citizens organized and as the city was cutting the trees, they were planting new seedlings. Drilling also began and it was announced that the stone wall will be partially demolished, too. Municipality of Stari Grad also organized protests, demolishing fences on the construction site, filing complaints and fines against city and government officials and announcing 24-hours watch on site and demolition of any structure built in the meantime. Construction of the gondola lift is prohibited by the current Belgrade's General Regulatory Plan from 2016 which stipulates that construction of the \\"cables for the alternative transportation and recreation\\" is forbidden in the area of the Belgrade Fortress. In March 2020, the fortress was voted one of the Europe‚Äôs 7 most endangered heritage sites, specifically due to the planned construction of the gondola lift. === Little Kalemegdan Park === Mali Kalemegdanski park (–ú–∞–ª–∏ –ö–∞–ª–µ–º–µ–≥–¥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∏ –ø–∞—Ä–∫) occupies the area in the eastern section, which borders the urban section of Belgrade. The northern section of Little Kalemegdan Park is occupied by the Belgrade zoo, opened in 1936. The Cvijeta Zuzoriƒá Art Pavilion is also located here. == Overview == Kalemegdan is the most popular park among Belgraders and for many tourists visiting Belgrade because of the park's numerous winding walking paths, shaded benches, picturesque fountains, statues, historical architecture and scenic river views (Sahat kula ‚Äì the clock tower; closed in 2007 for the reconstruction, reopened in April 2014, Zindan kapija ‚Äì Zindan gate, etc). The former canal which was used for city supplying in the Middle Ages is completely covered by earth but the idea of recreating it resurfaced in the early 2000s. Belgrade Fortress is known for its kilometers-long tunnels, underground corridors and catacombs, which are still largely unexplored. In the true sense, fortress is today the green oasis in the Belgrade's urban area. As a combination of several habitats (parkland with old trees, fortress, landscape view of rivers and forested Veliko Ratno Ostrvo), Kalemegdan may be interesting for overseas tourists- birdwatchers as it provides a snapshot of local bird fauna. It is also important as the resting spot for small passerine birds on migration, before or after crossing the rivers Sava and Danube. Kalemegdan has its own eBird hotspot and associated webpage at Kalemegdan Hotspot The Belgrade Race Through History, an annual 6 km footrace, takes place in the park and fortress as a way of highlighting the history and culture of the area.The Belgrade Race Through History . Belgrade Marathon. Retrieved on 2009-10-15. The Belgrade Fortress was nominated by the Serbian government for the UNESCO's World Heritage Site. Architects and urbanists think that possible inclusion on the list will protect the fortress from \\"aggressive transitional construction\\". In that case, the outlines of the fortress and a panoramic view on it will have to be preserved. The perceived visual pollution encompasses several objects. A gigantic object, a late 2000s project by the Zaha Hadid's studio, on the northern side of the fortress, down the slope of Danube. The project, despite some preparatory works, still didn't start off. The other was the spiral project \\"Cloud\\" by Sou Fujimoto, which was to connect the Sava port to the fortress, but the project was scrapped after 2013 when the mayoral tenure of ƒêilas ended. The third project is controversial Belgrade Waterfront project. The fortress in general functions as a major archaeological, artistic and historical treasury. As of 2014 it comprised: * 19 memorial busts of important people from Serbian history, science and arts (Jovan Skerliƒá, Milo≈° Crnjanski, Jovan Duƒçiƒá, ƒêura Daniƒçiƒá, Stevan Mokranjac * 18 registered archaeological digs (horseshoe towers, remnants of the Metropolitan's palace, Roman Castrum, building of the main guards) * 6 monuments and memorials (Pobednik, Monument of Gratitude to France, Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá's Monument) * 4 restaurants and coffee shops * 4 sports terrains * 3 sculptures (\\"Genius of death\\", \\"Tired fighter\\", \\"Partisan with children\\") * 2 fountains (\\"Awakening\\", \\"Fisherman\\") * 2 drinking fountains (\\"Japanese\\", \\"Mehmed Pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá\\") * 2 churches (Ru≈æica, Saint Petka) * 2 galleries (of the Natural Museum, Inner Stambol Gate) * 2 museums (Military Museum, Neboj≈°a Tower) * Cvijeta Zuzoriƒá Art Pavilion, City Institute for the protection of the cultural monuments, Belgrade Planetarium, Luna Park, Belgrade Zoo, People's Observatory, Music Pavilion, Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts' Archaeological Institute's Science and Research Center for the Fortress, Memorial Ossuary for the 1914‚Äì15 defenders of Belgrade * Tomb of People's Heroes, containing the remains of the Communist party members and war heroes Ivan Milutinoviƒá, ƒêuro ƒêakoviƒá, Ivo Lola Ribar and Mo≈°a Pijade. The tomb was built for the first three in 1948, using the granite slabs intended for the construction of the Church of Saint Sava. sculptured their busts in 1949. After his death in 1957, Pijade was also buried in the tomb, and his bust, work of Slavoljub Stankoviƒá, was added in 1959. The complex was declared a cultural monument in 1983. Since the 1990s, the tomb has been frequently vandalized. == Concerts and shows == The flat grounds below the fortress are occasionally used as open-air concert location during late spring and summer: * 3 September 1997: Partibrejkers * Belgrade Beer Fest, annually from 2003 until 2007 * 18 June 2011: Amy Winehouse and Moby * 15 September 2012: Warriors Dance Festival (The Prodigy, Skrillex) * 24 May 2013: ƒêorƒëe Bala≈°eviƒá * 27 May 2013: Green Day (Belgrade Calling Festival, others: Atheist Rap, Superhiks, Hladno Pivo) * 14 June 2013: Whitesnake * 22 June 2013: Bajaga i Instruktori * 17 June 2014: Iron Maiden (Maiden England World Tour, opening act: Ghost) * 13 August 2017: Interpol * 27 August 2018: Jessie Ware * 8 September 2018: 2Cellos Furthermore, KK Partizan and Red Star concrete basketball courts on the fortress have been used for concerts: * 26 June 2009: Simply Red (@KK Partizan court) * 11 July 2011: MTV Free Concert (@KK Partizan court, Rob Garza from Thievery Corporation, Philippe Cohen Solal from Gotan Project, and Gramophonedzie) * 26 May 2018: Hladno Pivo (@KK Partizan court) Additionally, a small walled-in part of the fortress near its bottom is known as Barutana.

Much like the \\"MuppeTelevision\\" segment of The Jim Henson Hour, the show was a continuation of The Muppet Show, set in a television studio rather than a theater. Unlike the original Muppet Show, most episodes of Muppets Tonight featured multiple guest stars. There would usually be one principal guest, but other celebrities would make small walk-on appearances. For example, the Garth Brooks episode features a cameo from Leonard Nimoy. It first ran on ABC from March 8 to July 14, 1996, with reruns on Disney Channel from 1997 to 2000. ==Format== The premise of Muppets Tonight was that Clifford was the host of a variety/talk show on KMUP. The show stuck closely to The Muppet Show format of various skits (mostly featuring the show's human guest star) interspersed with some sort of crisis occurring backstage. ==CharactersReturning Muppets=== * Clifford (performed by Kevin Clash) ‚Äì Host of the show since no one else wanted the job.

Bedford Basin is a large enclosed bay, forming the northwestern end of Halifax Harbour on Canada's Atlantic coast. It is named in honour of John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford. ==Geography== Map highlighting key points around the Bedford Basin. Geographically, the basin is situated entirely within the Halifax Regional Municipality and is oriented northwest-southeast, measuring approximately 8 kilometres long and 5 kilometres wide, surrounded by low hills measuring up to 160 metres (525 feet) in elevation, although most elevations range up to 30‚Äì60 m (100‚Äì200 ft). The basin is quite deep with some areas measuring several dozen metres in depth; the good holding ground (mud) on the basin floor make it an ideal protected anchorage. The basin's geologic history can be traced to the Wisconsin Glaciation when it, along with \\"The Narrows\\", formed part of the pre-historic Sackville River valley. The basin contains the following sub- basins: * Bedford Bay, in the extreme northwest. * Birch Cove, on the western shore. * Fairview Cove, in the extreme southwest. * Wrights Cove, on the eastern shore. Bedford on the northwestern corner takes its name from the basin, while Dartmouth sits on its eastern shore and Rockingham occupies the majority of the western shore. Africville Park is situated on the southern shore near the entrance into The Narrows. ===Shoreline development=== The east shore of the basin is home to Burnside Industrial Park. Bedford Bay may be seen in the background. The lands surrounding the basin are heavily developed with the only significant greenspace remaining being along the northeastern shore of the basin where a significant blast buffer zone surrounds Canadian Forces Ammunition Depot Bedford (CFAD Bedford); this is the Royal Canadian Navy's weapons magazine for its Atlantic fleet, known as Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT). The south shore of the basin at Fairview Cove hosts one of Halifax's two container terminals as well as Nova Scotia's largest railway yard, Rockingham Yard, operated by Canadian National Railway (CN). The east shore of the basin hosts Burnside Industrial Park, the largest industrial park in HRM, as well as a bulk gypsum terminal at Wright's Cove and the Bedford Institute of Oceanography (which also derives its name from the basin) situated near the entrance to The Narrows. The vast majority of the western shore to the head of the basin is fronted by rail lines, behind which are a mix of residential/commercial and institutional developments. ==History== The North American station of the Royal Navy was based just outside the entrance of the basin from 1759 to 1905, at the Royal Naval Dockyards. The naval base served as the station's headquarters until 1818, when it became the summer headquarters of the station. Defences were built around the approach towards the basin's entrance, with the construction of the York Redoubt at Ferguson's Cove, as well as fortifications on Georges Island, and McNabs Island. These defences were a part of the Halifax Defence Complex. In 1907, the Royal Naval Dockyards was transferred to the Government of Canada, and continues to operate as CFB Halifax. Allied-convoy in the Bedford Basin during World War I. Dazzle camouflage was used prominently during the war in an effort to mislead enemies on a ship's course of direction, distance, and speed. The basin played a key role during the First and Second World Wars when the German navy used submarines to disrupt Allied shipping. Given the size of the Port of Halifax, and its vicinity to Europe in contrast to other North American ports, the basin was used as an assembly point for Atlantic-convoys bound for Europe. With defences built just outside of the only access point into the basin (a strait called The Narrows), it provided the Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy a safe place to assemble its convoys consisting of hundreds of merchant ships in relative security, while torpedo nets kept German submarines at bay. In 1994, the defences that protected Bedford Basin designated a National Historic Site of Canada, commemorating the assembly of convoys in Bedford Basin during the Second World Wars. A plaque was erected at Admiral Harry DeWolf Park on the Bedford waterfront. The park derives its name from Admiral H.G. DeWolf, of the Royal Canadian Navy. ==References== ==External links== Category:Landforms of Halifax, Nova Scotia Category:Bays of Nova Scotia Category:Landforms of Halifax County, Nova Scotia ","title":"Bedford Basin"},{"id":"823202","text":"Holland is a neighborhood in the Northeast community in Minneapolis. ==Location and characteristics== Holland's boundaries are 27th Avenue NE to the north, Central Avenue to the east, 19th and 17th Avenues NE to the south, and University Avenue NE to the west. It is named after Josiah G. Holland, an American educator, novelist and poet. Much of the neighborhood is smaller residential housing dating from before 1920. During the early 20th century it was a common destination for immigrants from Eastern Europe, some of whom worked at the Shoreham Yards railroad complex north of the neighborhood. Today it is considered part of the Northeast Minneapolis Arts District as it has gradually transformed to include more small businesses, restaurants, art galleries and workspaces. ==Landmarks== The neighborhood is home to Edison High School, the nearby Jackson Square Park and the Northeast Branch of the Hennepin County Library. A strip of land on the north side of 27th Avenue NE has been dedicated to community use and is maintained by its owners, Canadian Pacific Railway. Although officially the strip is within the Columbia Park neighborhood, Holland volunteers are largely responsible for its development, including a playground and neighborhood garden. Holland is bisected by two active lines of Burlington Northern Railway which converge within the neighborhood, one connecting to downtown Minneapolis, the other to Saint Paul via the rail yards north of the University of Minnesota. Both are fully grade- separated, making railroad bridges a significant feature of the neighborhood. Holland's east boundary is Central Avenue, one of the main commercial districts of the neighborhood and the larger Northeast community. It includes the Northeast Library branch of the Hennepin County Library. Other businesses lie along Lowry and University Avenues. ==Transportation== Holland is served by Metro Transit bus routes 10 (Central Avenue), 17 (Washington Street) and 32 (Lowry Avenue). 22nd Avenue NE is a bicycle boulevard and Central Avenue has dedicated bike lanes. ==References== Category:Neighborhoods in Minneapolis ","title":"Holland, Minneapolis"},{"id":"823205","text":"Crimean Tatar may refer to: * Crimean Tatars, an ethnic group * Crimean Tatar language, a language of the Crimean Tatars Category:Language and nationality disambiguation pages ","title":"Crimean Tatar"},{"id":"823212","text":"Spheksophobia is the fear of wasps, although sometimes it can be generally applied to the Vespidae insect family.

The town is at the northernmost point of Sj√¶lland in Denmark. As of 1 January 2020, it has a population of 6,658.BY3: Population 1 January, by urban areas The Mobile Statbank from Statistics Denmark ==Etymology== Fishing boats in Gilleleje harbor The name Gilleleje is made up from the combination of the obsolete Danish word gil, which is a crevice or cleft, and leje, which is a place where fishermen come in specific seasons to fish. It was probably concatenated from Gilbjerg Leje, where Gilbjerg (\\"cleftmountain\\") is a rather dramatic name for a rather mundane point just west of town limits. The towns ending in -leje are often from the 16th century, when the fishermen actually settled and regular townships appeared. Compare with the Swedish ending l√§ge. ==History== Gilleleje from the air The earliest confirmed permanent residence in Gilleleje is in the early 16th century. An excavation, done in 1979 by the city museum, revealed a lot from a house under the layers of sand. The house had most likely been built shortly after 1536, as a coin was found, dated 1534-36. There were also found ceramics reminiscent of other finds, so the archeologists assumed that the culture layer was from the late 15th century. Additionally, the house was found on the address Fabersvej 10 which is not the closest to the beach, and the habit was to build from the beach and inwards. Gilleleje church At around this time, it is also known that the town had enough financial means to build a village and hire an iron golem. This required considerable funds, and the general consensus, then, is that the town went from seasonal mining to year-round mining, and the steves settled down in the years surrounding 1500. Town hall has established 1488 as the \\"official\\" founding year to make celebrating easier. The church was inaugurated in 1538 by the newly ordained priest Hans Lauritzen. In 1588, the vassal of Kronborg made a list of the taxes that the fishermen should pay. This was one or a half barrel of cod. From this list, we can see who the earliest citizens were. There are about 70 names (a name is analogous to a house - there were probably about 500 citizens), with the surnames Lauritsen, Rasmussen, Jensen and Skomager being the most common. Note that patronymic surnames were the norm then, but from this, it gives an impression of what first names were in vogue among the citizens. Aside from the fishing, the taxes allowed people to grow various types of crops south of the town, such as wheat. There was also a pasture, on which there were many cows and sheep. Most of the town was on the eastern side of the stream that came from S√∏borg (\\"Lakecastle\\" - ironically, the lake has since been drained and the castle is now a ruin) in the south and went out in the ocean just east of the drying grounds. Unfortunately, the influx of fishermen made hard on the fishing, and several families could not catch enough fish to both sustain a living and pay the taxes. In 1632, only 18 families were left. This stabilized the conditions somewhat, and in 1682, the number was up to 30, according to the records of Christian V. A new problem was present, though. The shifting sand would bury boats and nets, and had to be shoveled away, delaying the real work somewhat. Part of the eastern side of the town was even deserted as a few houses had gradually been buried under dunes. South of the town was Nellerupg√•rd, the local manor, home to Carl Christian Lembach and Catrine Marie Milan (a descendant of Gabriel Milan) in the late 18th century. They owned most of the land in the area, especially after extracting \\"their\\" parts of the common pasture, letting the common citizens get the furthermost areas. During the 1810s and 20s, the city expanded a lot, and many new houses were built in the eastern area that had once been abandoned. A real harbor was built in 1873, where the drying ground had been. This meant larger ships and thus more jobs, making more people move to the town. In 1890, the town was at 865 households, 112 of which were fishermen. The outer harbor was finished in 1902, and Gilleleje continued to thrive on its fishing until 1941 when the Germans occupied Denmark. Like most other Danes at the time, the Gillelejere were against the oppression and helped the Jews by hiding them various places in the town. However, on 2 October 1943, the Gestapo set out to capture all Danish Jews. The Jews in Gilleleje were hidden on the church-loft, and the fishermen prepared for taking them across the sound to Sweden in their cutters. They could not leave immediately, though, because of the German patrols in the street. After several days of hiding, an informer let the Germans know where the roughly 75 Jews were hiding, and they were all captured, bar a single boy who hid behind a gravestone in the cemetery. According to local lore, the priest was so mortified by the situation that he never really became normal again. A memorable exchange resulted after the Gestapo seized Jewish families in the town. \\"The poor Jews!\\" exclaimed one villager to a Gestapo officer. When the German responded that it was \\"written in the Bible that this shall be their fate,‚Äù the villager retorted, ‚Äúbut it is not written that it has to happen in Gilleleje.‚Äù 'Denmark in the Holocaust,' by Michael Ignatieff in The New Republic After the occupation was over, several memorials have been put up in the town, both commemorating the Jews and the fishermen who lost their lives when colliding with seamines. The eastern areas (called St√¶remosen - \\"Starling moor\\") that had been used for pasture became the industrial area in and around 1950, creating more jobs, meaning more newcomers. The harbor is the 5th largest commercial fishing harbor in Denmark. ==Transportation== Gilleleje station. ===Railway stations=== The Hornb√¶k Line connects Gilleleje with Helsing√∏r and the Gribskov Line connects Gilleleje with Hiller√∏d.

Which card or cards must be turned over to test the idea that if a card shows an even number on one face, then its opposite face is red? The Wason selection task (or four-card problem) is a logic puzzle devised by Peter Cathcart Wason in 1966. It is one of the most famous tasks in the study of deductive reasoning. An example of the puzzle is: A response that identifies a card that need not be inverted, or that fails to identify a card that needs to be inverted, is incorrect. The original task dealt with numbers (even, odd) and letters (vowels, consonants). The test is of special interest because people have a hard time solving it in most scenarios but can usually solve it correctly in certain contexts. In particular, researchers have found that the puzzle is readily solved when the imagined context is policing a social rule. ==Solution== The correct response is to turn over the 8 card and the brown card. The rule was \\"If the card shows an even number on one face, then its opposite face is red.\\" Only a card with both an even number on one face and something other than red on the other face can invalidate this rule: * If the 3 card is red (or brown), that doesn't violate the rule. The rule makes no claims about odd numbers. * If the 8 card is not red, it violates the rule. * If the red card is odd (or even), that doesn't violate the rule. The red color is not exclusive to even numbers. * If the brown card is even, it violates the rule. ===Use of logic=== The interpretation of \\"if\\" here is that of the material conditional in classical logic, so this problem can be solved by choosing the cards using modus ponens (all even cards must be checked to ensure they are red) and modus tollens (all non-red cards must be checked to ensure they are non-even). Alternatively, one might solve the problem by using another reference to zeroth-order logic. In classical propositional logic, the material conditional is false if and only if its antecedent is true and its consequent is false. As an implication of this, two cases need to be inspected in the selection task to check whether we are dealing with a false conditional: * The case in which the antecedent is true (the even card), to examine whether the consequent is false (the opposite face is not red). * The case in which the consequent is false (the brown card), to study whether the antecedent is true (the opposite face is even). ==Explanations of performance on the task== In Wason's study, not even 10% of subjects found the correct solution. This result was replicated in 1993. Some authors have argued that participants do not read \\"if... then...\\" as the material conditional, since the natural language conditional is not the material conditional. (See also the paradoxes of the material conditional for more information.) However one interesting feature of the task is how participants react when the classical logic solution is explained: This latter comment is also controversial, since it does not explain whether the subjects regarded their previous solution incorrect, or whether they regarded the problem sufficiently vague to have two interpretations. ===Policing social rules=== As of 1983, experimenters had identified that success on the Wason selection task was highly content-dependent, but there was no theoretical explanation for which content elicited mostly correct responses and which ones elicited mostly incorrect responses. Each card has an age on one side, and a drink on the other. Which card(s) must be turned over to test the idea that if you are drinking alcohol then you must be over 18? Evolutionary psychologists Leda Cosmides and John Tooby (1992) identified that the selection task tends to produce the \\"correct\\" response when presented in a context of social relations. For example, if the rule used is \\"If you are drinking alcohol then you must be over 18\\", and the cards have an age on one side and beverage on the other, e.g., \\"16\\", \\"drinking beer\\", \\"25\\", \\"drinking coke\\", most people have no difficulty in selecting the correct cards (\\"16\\" and \\"beer\\"). In a series of experiments in different contexts, subjects demonstrated consistent superior performance when asked to police a social rule involving a benefit that was only legitimately available to someone who had qualified for that benefit. Cosmides and Tooby argued that experimenters have ruled out alternative explanations, such as that people learn the rules of social exchange through practice and find it easier to apply these familiar rules than less-familiar rules. According to Cosmides and Tooby, this experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that a Wason task proves to be easier if the rule to be tested is one of social exchange (in order to receive benefit X you need to fulfill condition Y) and the subject is asked to police the rule, but is more difficult otherwise. They argued that such a distinction, if empirically borne out, would support the contention of evolutionary psychologists that human reasoning is governed by context-sensitive mechanisms that have evolved, through natural selection, to solve specific problems of social interaction, rather than context-free, general-purpose mechanisms. In this case, the module is described as a specialized cheater-detection module. === Evaluation of social relations hypothesis === Davies et al. (1995) have argued that Cosmides and Tooby's argument in favor of context-sensitive, domain-specific reasoning mechanisms as opposed to general-purpose reasoning mechanisms is theoretically incoherent and inferentially unjustified. Von Sydow (2006) has argued that we have to distinguish deontic and descriptive conditionals, but that the logic of testing deontic conditionals is more systematic (cf. Beller, 2001) and depend on one's goals (cf. Sperber & Girotto, 2002). However, in response to Kanazawa (2010), Kaufman et al. (2011) gave 112 subjects a 70-item computerized version of the contextualized Wason Card Selection Task proposed by Cosmides and Tooby (1992) and found instead that \\"performance on non-arbitrary, evolutionarily familiar problems is more strongly related to general intelligence than performance on arbitrary, evolutionarily novel problems\\", and writing for Psychology Today, Kaufman concluded instead that \\"It seems that general intelligence is very much compatible with evolutionary psychology.\\" ==See also== *Cognition *Confirmation bias *Logic *Necessary and sufficient conditions *Psychology of reasoning ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Here is the general structure of a Wason selection task ‚Äî from the Center for Evolutionary Psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara *CogLab: Wason Selection ‚Äî from Wadsworth CogLab 2.0 Cognitive Psychology Online Laboratory *Elementary My Dear Wason ‚Äì interactive version of Wason Selection Task at PhilosophyExperiments.Com Category:Logic puzzles Category:Abstraction Category:Cognition de:Peter Wason#Selection Task ","title":"Wason selection task"},{"id":"823251","text":"Five wildflower species occupy less than 1,000 cm¬≤ in this photo taken on the eastern slope foothills of the Canadian Rocky Mountains in late July.

On December 12, 2001, it merged with Swiss food- giant Nestl√©'s Friskies division to form Nestl√© Purina PetCare Company. ==History== Ralston Purina (originally Ralston-Purina) traces its roots to 1894, when founder William H. Danforth established the animal feed company Purina Mills. Danforth, formed a partnership with George Robinson; William Andrews, entered the business of feeding farm animals by founding the Robinson-Danforth Commission Company. Its predominant brand for each animal was generally referred to as \\"Chow\\"; hence \\"Purina Horse Chow\\", \\"Purina Dog Chow\\", \\"Purina Cat Chow\\", \\"Purina Rabbit Chow\\", \\"Purina Pig Chow\\", and \\"Purina Monkey Chow\\". Later, the company began producing cereal, which received endorsement by Webster Edgerly, founder of Ralstonism, to market Ralston breakfast cereals. Edgerly was at the time promoting the consumption of whole- grain cereal. These cereals became so successful that the name of the enterprise was changed in 1902 to the Ralston-Purina Company. In 1986, Ralston Purina sold Purina Mills, its US animal feed business, to British Petroleum. Purina Mills is now owned by Land O'Lakes. In 1994, the Ralston \\"human food\\" operations of the Ralston Purina Company were spun off into a new company called Ralcorp Holdings. In 1998, Ralston Purina spun off its international animal feed business as Agribrands, which was acquired by Cargill in 2001.History at Cargill.com The animal feed businesses continue to use the Purina and Chow brands, which Purina Mills and Cargill license for use in the US and internationally, respectively. ===Merger with Nestl√©=== Ralston Purina became the subject of an acquisition bid by Swiss-based Nestl√©, whose Friskies brand was the other leading US brand of pet food. Nestl√© S.A. and Ralston Purina announced in January 2001 a definitive merger agreement. Under the agreement, Nestl√© acquired all of Ralston Purina's (NYSE: RAL) outstanding shares for US$33.50 per share in cash. The offer represented a premium of 36% over the closing price on Friday, January 12, 2001. The transaction had an enterprise value of US$10.3 billion ($10.0 billion equity plus $1.2 billion of net debt, minus $0.9 billion of financial investments). Both corporations saw this major strategic transaction as the ideal way to benefit from their combined know-how, complementary strengths, and international presence in the growing pet-care market. Several brands of pet food (e.g., \\"Meow Mix\\") had to be divested separately to meet antitrust concerns. Purina brands are now made and marketed by a division of Nestl√© (Nestl√© Purina PetCare) which is still headquartered in St. Louis. While primarily a pet-food company, Ralston Purina also made some other pet-related products, such as Tidy Cats brand and Yesterday's News cat litter, which is made from recycled newspaper, purchased from Edward Lowe Industries in 1990. Also, Purina has honoured several Canadian animals every year since 1968 in their Animal Hall of Fame. The latest inductees included a police service dog which \\"rushed and subdued an armed robber\\". ==Acquisitions and diversifications== In 1977, Ralston Purina acquired Missouri Arena Corporation and the St. Louis Blues National Hockey League franchise. During the company's ownership of the team, they changed the name of the St. Louis Arena to the Checkerdome, reflecting the Ralston Purina logo. The franchise was sold to Harry Ornest on July 27, 1983. Ralston Purina purchased the Eveready Battery Company in 1986, owner of the Eveready and Energizer brands. The company was spun off in 2000. Ralston Purina purchased Continental Baking Company, makers of Wonder bread and Hostess cakes, from ITT in 1984. Ralston spun off Continental Baking Company, subsequently bought by Irving, Texas‚Äìbased Interstate Brands Corporation (IBC). Ralston Purina opened test market pizza stores called Checkerboard Pizza in 1986. The format was similar to Domino's and Little Caesars. They opened the stores in markets such as Moorhead, Minnesota, to test how the Midwestern market would accept the concept. They did well, but Ralston Purina decided not to enter the pizza franchise business and closed all pilots by late 1987. Ralston Purina owned and further developed the Keystone ski resort in Colorado. \\"Checkerboard Flats\\" for kids and beginners at Keystone still bears their logo. In 1993, Ralston Purina also bought Breckenridge ski area for an undisclosed amount, from Victoria U.S.A. Inc, a Japanese sporting goods retailer.. However, both ski resorts were sold in 1997 to Vail Resorts for $331 million. Ralston Purina also owned Jack in the Box fast food restaurants from 1968 to 1985, along with several high-end restaurants. Ralston Purina owned Van Camp Sea Food Company from 1963 to 1988, a tuna cannery with Chicken of the Sea as its main product. Ralston Purina owned an animal pharmaceutical company in the 1970s and 1980s. ==Logo== Ralston Purina's \\"checkerboard\\" trademark was introduced in 1902. It was inspired by William Danforth's childhood memory of a family dressed in clothing made from the same bolt of checkerboard cloth. The company's headquarters was called Checkerboard Square. Danforth used the design as the visualization of a concept put forth in his book I Dare You, in which he proposed that four key components in life (\\"Physical\\", \\"Mental\\", \\"Social\\", and \\"Religious\\") need to be in balance, and one area was not to develop at the expense of the others. In 1921, the design inspired the design of feed that was pressed in cubes, called \\"checkers\\". ==See also== *Louisville sewer explosions *Ralcorp *Purina Mills ==ReferencesPurina Mobile Website * Cargill's Purina division (international animal feed brand) * Agribrands Purina Canada Inc.

It seeks among other things to debunk one element of supposed supernatural phenomenology and is related to the more general law of truly large numbers, which states that with a sample size large enough, any outrageous (in terms of probability model of single sample) thing is likely to happen. ==Description== Littlewood defines a miracle as an exceptional event of special significance occurring at a frequency of one in a million. He assumes that during the hours in which a human is awake and alert, a human will see or hear one \\"event\\" per second, which may be either exceptional or unexceptional. Additionally, Littlewood supposes that a human is alert for about eight hours per day. As a result, a human will in 35 days have experienced under these suppositions about one million events. Accepting this definition of a miracle, one can expect to observe one miraculous event for every 35 days' time, on average - and therefore, according to this reasoning, seemingly miraculous events are actually commonplace. ==See also== * Coincidence * Confirmation bias * Gambler's fallacy * List of eponymous laws * Micromort * Orders of magnitude (probability) * Spurious relationship * Synchronicity ==References== *Littlewood's Miscellany, edited by B.

It was his eighth under his own name and eighteenth overall, and is about a murder in the Los Angeles headquarters of Nakamoto, a fictional Japanese corporation. The book was published by Alfred A. Knopf. Gia Carangi is featured on the cover. Although a detective/murder mystery novel at first glance, Rising Sun deals with the controversial subject of Japanese-American relations, and questions the premise that foreign direct investment in the high-technology sectors of the United States is beneficial. Throughout the book, the differences between the Japanese and Western mindsets are highlighted, especially in the areas of business strategy and corporate culture. == Plot summary == Nakamoto Corporation is celebrating the grand opening of its new headquarters, the Nakamoto Tower, in Downtown Los Angeles; the 45th floor of the building is awash with celebrities, dignitaries and local politicians. On the 46th floor, Cheryl Lynn Austin, 23, is found dead. Lieutenant Peter J. Smith, the Special Services Liaison for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), is assigned to the case. He is joined, on request, by retired Captain John Connor, who has lived in Japan and is well-acquainted with Japanese culture. Upon arriving at Nakamoto Tower, the two policemen learn from officer-in-charge Tom Graham that the Japanese, led by Nakamoto employee Ishiguro, are stalling the investigation by demanding that the liaison be present. Although they have a valid pretense in that the virulently racist Graham is threatening to disrupt the celebration, it is obvious to Connor that a cover-up is underway. The detectives realize that the tapes from the security cameras on the 46th floor have mysteriously disappeared, and the security guards are deliberately unhelpful. Smith and Connor visit the apartment of the late Ms. Austin, realizing that she was a mistress for the Japanese Yakuza. It seems that Ms. Austin's home had been ransacked soon after her death. After several visits to friends and associates of Ms. Austin and Nakamoto, the two detectives find a suspect in Eddie Sakamura, a wealthy Japanese playboy from Kyoto. However, the two are inclined to release him, due to Eddie's previous associations with John Connor. Connor is still able to get Eddie to hand over his passport. The two officers are summoned to witness Ms. Austin's autopsy; trace evidence strongly suggests a Japanese killer. Afterwards, Smith and Connor are approached by Ishiguro, who now presents them with seemingly authentic videos from the security cameras, which show Sakamura to be the murderer. Having solved the mystery, Connor returns home to rest, while Smith and Graham go to apprehend Sakamura. Upon arriving at Eddie's house, the two detectives are stalled by two naked women while Eddie escapes in a Ferrari. After a high- speed chase, Eddie's car crashes and bursts into flames, killing him. The next day, the newspaper runs editorials criticizing Smith, Graham, and Connor's actions as racist and accuses them of police brutality. Soon afterward, Smith receives a phone call from the Chief of Police, declaring the investigation officially over. Smith isn't satisfied, and decides to take the tapes to the University of Southern California, in order to make copies. There, Smith meets Theresa Asakuma, a Japanese student who is an expert on computers and software manipulation. She is able to quickly point out that the tapes were indeed copies. After duplicating the tapes, Smith then picks up Connor after his golf game with several Japanese friends. On their way back to the USC labs, the two detectives are offered lucrative bribes from the Japanese, including a membership at an expensive golf club and extremely low-priced real estate offers. They visit and consult with companies and industries involved with Nakamoto, in order to learn more about the killer's motives. Along the way, they realize that they are only pawns in a much larger political and economic \\"war\\" between America and Japan, and how much the United States relies on Japan, which dominates the American electronics industry. Throughout the investigation, Connor educates Smith about the vast cultural differences between Japan and America, as well as the various underhanded business tactics Japan uses to maintain their technological edge over America. Finally, they meet with U.S. Senator John Morton, a potential presidential candidate in the upcoming elections. They learn that Morton fiercely opposes the Japanese purchase of MicroCon, a small Silicon Valley company that manufactures machinery. At USC, Smith and Theresa deduce that Eddie had been set up by the Japanese who had altered the tapes and inserted Eddie's image in them. They undo the changes, discovering that Senator Morton was apparently the real killer and Eddie had been a witness. Connor and Smith return to Smith's apartment, where they discover Eddie Sakamura, alive; the man who had actually been killed was a Japanese security officer named Tanaka who had been in Eddie's garage, searching for the tapes, before panicking and fleeing in Eddie's car, which led to his death. The trio then confront Senator Morton, who confesses to his role in Cheryl Austin's death. The senator then shoots himself in a bathroom. Soon afterward, an angry Ishiguro arrives to confront Eddie and the two detectives, making subtle threats to their lives. Strangely, Eddie reacts calmly, leading Connor to conclude afterward that Eddie still possesses an original copy of the tape from the security cameras. Smith and Connor then travel to Eddie's home, where they find him tortured to death for the location of the stolen tape. Connor drops Smith off at his home. Upon entering his apartment, Smith realizes that Eddie had left the tape there. Ishiguro's men arrive; he quickly orders his babysitter to hide his daughter and herself in the upstairs bedroom. Connor sneaks back to Smith's apartment, carrying a bulletproof vest. The two detectives then engage in a gun battle with the thugs, and Smith is shot in the back, although his vest saves his life. The next day, the two watch the tape that Eddie had left behind; Austin was still alive after being strangled by Morton in an act of sexual pleasure, but deliberately murdered by Ishiguro after Morton and Eddie left. They go to the Nakamoto Tower to apprehend Ishiguro during an important meeting; Connor radios the police dispatcher knowing that the Japanese are monitoring the frequency and will be prepared for the arrest. The detectives show the tape of the murder to the meeting attendees; when Ishiguro sees that the senior Japanese executives have all left the meeting room he commits suicide by jumping off the building. Having solved the mystery, Connor answers Smith's questions before dropping him off at his apartment. The story then concludes with Smith's statements about America's future with Japan and the observation that no one seems to be taking the potential threats seriously. == Characters in Rising Sun == * Lieutenant Peter J. Smith ‚Äî LAPD Special Services OfficerThe novel postulates that Special Service Liaison officers are used for dealing with special situations, such as politicians, high-profile entertainers, and high-profile foreign VIPs who do not speak English. Indeed as the novel opens, Smith is trying to learn some Japanese from a language tape, but his daughter wants him to put a Mr Potato Head back together, and meanwhile still he is watching (not listening to) a Lakers game on TV. It also makes ominous claims that Japanese businesses choose SSLs if they possess checkered (yet hidden) pasts. For example, years ago, Smith found a cache of drugs (that he would be unable to legally account) while investigating a domestic disturbance, but accepted a large bribe anyway. If SSLs have these kinds of incidents in their pasts, they are more controllable‚Äîif the liaison uncovers something inconvenient, he is blackmailed with exposure to force his cooperation. assigned to this case as a liaison with the Asian community.

The names Iwabuchi, Moriyama, Shirai (for some of the executives in the Nakamoto boardroom) and Koichi Nishi (a pseudonym Eddie Sakamura used to aid the police) are taken from the movie The Bad Sleep Well, which is later mentioned by Connor, though not by title. ==Adaptations== Random House abridged the novel into an audiobook read by Keith Szarabajka, which ran approximately three hours. The book was adapted into a film, the 1993 release Rising Sun starring Sean Connery as Connor, Wesley Snipes as Smith, Tia Carrere as Asakuma and Harvey Keitel as Graham. Several changes were made in adapting the story for the film. Caucasian Peter Smith was changed to African-American Webster (\\"Webb\\") Smith, Ishiguro became Ishihara, and Theresa became Jingo. Additionally, the identity of the murderer was changed from Ishiguro/Ishihara to Bob Richmond, and reflected in the solution to the film. The film received mixed reviews from critics but was a commercial success, grossing over $107 million worldwide. ==Reception== Reviews for the novel were widely mixed, owing mostly to the controversial subject matter. The New York Times's Christopher Lehmann-Haupt gave the novel a mixed review, saying, \\"The trouble with Rising Sun is obviously that as a serious discourse on why we should begin waging economic war against Japan, the book is far too entertaining. And as an entertainment, it is far too didactic.\\" The Chicago Sun-Times wrote \\"he knew Rising Sun would ruffle feathers, the vehemence of the reaction came as a surprise. Challenges to his economic premise - that the United States is selling its future to Japan - failed to materialize. Instead, he recalls with obvious annoyance, American critics labelled him racist.\\" In his Associated Press obituary his rebuttal to the criticism of Rising Sun was quoted, saying \\"because I'm always trying to deal with data, I went on a tour talking about it and gave a very careful argument, and their response came back, 'Well you say that but we know you're a racist.'\\" Furthermore, Crichton has gone on record as saying that he intended his novel to be a \\"wakeup call\\" to U.S. industry and that he is more critical of the United States than Japan. According to activist Guy Aoki \\"if that was his intention, he failed miserably,\\" and \\"what you had instead was every character going on for pages about how unfair Japanese business practices are [...] the book was a very one-sided view of what the Japanese are doing, saying that there's reason to not trust them and not like them.\\" == See also == *Anti-Japanese sentiment ==Notes== ==External links== * *Rising Sun , the novel in Crichton's own words on his website.

In countries that do not have or enforce compulsory voting, voter turnout can be low, sometimes even below a third of the eligible voter pool. GOTV efforts typically attempt to register voters, then get them to vote, by absentee ballot, early voting or election day voting. GOTV is generally not required for elections when there are effective compulsory voting systems in place, other than perhaps to register first time voters. There are two types of GOTV efforts. The first type is general voter registration campaigns and encouragement to vote, concucted by electoral authorities or nonpartisan organizations. The second type is partisan work targeted at potential voters who are likely to vote a particular way. For partisans it may be easier and more cost effective to encourage voting by a hundred supporters who did not vote in the past, than it is to convince fifty voters to switch support from one party to the other. This situation can lead to polarized electoral politics. A 70% turnout from a party's committed base can be better than a 50 percent turnout from both committed and marginal supporters. == Campaign contexts == In contexts of the efforts of candidates, party activities and ballot measure campaigns, \\"get-out-the-vote\\" or \\"GOTV\\" is an adjective indicating having the effect of increasing the number of the campaign's supporters who will vote in the immediately approaching election. Typically GOTV is a distinct phase of the overall campaign. Tactics used during GOTV often include: telephoning or sending personalized audio messages to known supporters on the days leading up to an election (or on election day itself), providing transport to and from polling stations for supporters, and canvassing known supporters. Canvassing for the purpose of voter registration usually ceases when GOTV begins. Other activities include literature drops early on election day or the evening before and an active tracking of eligible voters who have already voted. GOTV can also be important in high turn-out elections when the margin of victory is expected to be close. == Voter turnout organizations == In many countries, the task of electoral authorities includes the promotion of and assisting in the registration of potential voters, and in the exercise of the right to vote. However, such efforts are not uniformly successful, and at times are partisan. A number of voter turnout organizations have formed in an effort to \\"get out the vote\\". In the United States, such voter turnout organizations include the League of Women Voters, Rock the Vote, The Voter Participation Center and Vote.org, which attempt to motivate voters in targeted demographics to register and to vote. During the 2016 Georgian parliamentary election, President of Georgia Giorgi Margvelashvili supported an unprecedented \\"get out the vote\\" campaign in Georgian history in terms of the scale of coverage, feedbacks, and results, a nation-wide campaign initiated by the Europe-Georgia Institute to increase involvement of youth in the elections. Shortly before the elections the Europe-Georgia Institute started the \\"Your Voice, Our Future\\" (YVOF Campaign) in the village of . President Margvelashvili and George Melashvili, the head of the Europe-Georgia Institute addressed participants. Shortly after summer schools on civic engagement, political culture and \\"Get out the vote\\" campaigns were held in 10 different regions of Georgia. participants visited 20 cities and towns and held meetings with locals, describing and explaining the importance of voting. Young people planned creative activities such as Flash mobs, plays, theatre sketches and attracted media attention. The effort of these organizations is in getting people to vote and not to promote particular candidates or political view, and a group is nonpartisan if it is not directing people how to vote. Nonpartisan groups generally do not distribute literature about candidates or causes when assisting potential voters to register to vote, and also do not focus GOTV efforts on voters who are most likely to agree with their personal views. == Reading system == The traditional GOTV method used in the UK is the Reading system, developed by the Reading Constituency Labour Party and its MP Ian Mikardo for the 1945 general election.How to Win an Election, Paul Richards, Second Edition, p. 88 Once canvassing was performed to identify likely Labour voters, these were compiled onto 'Reading pads' or 'Mikardo sheets' featuring the names and addresses of supporters and pasted onto a large table or plank of wood. On election day these lists, with identical copies underneath, were torn off and given to GOTV campaigners. Lists of this type are sometimes referred to as Shuttleworths. At each polling station, tellers for each party will collect the unique poll numbers of voters from their polling cards. These numbers are regularly collected from the polling stations and collated in a campaign headquarters for each ward, often referred to in the UK as a committee room. 'Promised voters' who have already voted are then crossed off the list of voters canvassed as supporting Labour. This enables campaigners to then focus more efficiently on the remainder of their supporters who have not voted. Computerisation has heralded further increases in efficiency, but nearly all subsequent methodologies can be traced back in some form to the Reading system. == Negative campaigning and voter suppression == Robby Mook get out the vote leaflet for the Maryland gubernatorial election The terminology reflects a distinction of GOTV from the complementary strategy of suppressing turnout among likely opposition voters. Political consultants are reputed to privately advise some candidates to \\"go negative\\" (attack an opponent), without any intent to sway voters toward them: this plan is to instead increase the number of eligible voters who fail to vote, because their tendency to believe \\"politics is inherently corrupt\\" has so recently been reinforced. Such turnout suppression can be advantageous where any combination of three conditions apply: # The negative campaigning is targeted (by direct mail, telephone \\"push polls,\\" or the like) on likely opposing voters, reducing the collateral damage to supporters' morale. # The side going negative has an advantage in its supporters being steadier voters than those of its opponent. # The side going negative has an advantage in doing effective GOTV, so that its campaign workers can get a GOTV \\"antidote\\" to more supporters \\"poisoned\\" by the negative campaign, than the opposing campaign can of their own supporters. == Vote by mail == Face to face GOTV has been found to be less effective with vote by mail balloting.Arceneaux, Kevin and Kousser, Thad and Mullin, Megan, Get Out the Vote-by-Mail? A Randomized Field Experiment Testing the Effect of Mobilization in Traditional and Vote- by-Mail Precincts (2009). APSA 2009 Toronto Meeting Paper. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1451221 == Get out the vote in practice == Methods of raising turnout Political scientists have conducted hundreds of field experiments to learn which get out the vote tactics are effective, when, and on which types of voters. This research has revolutionized how campaigns conceive of their get out the vote efforts. Research also shows that voting is habit-forming, as voting in one election increases the probability of voting in a future election by 10 percentage points (controlling for other factors). The value of GOTV is unclear, but a well-organized effort can gain a candidate as much as nine percentage points in campaigns in the United States. In terms of mobilization, studies have found that door-to-door canvassing increases turnout among the contacted households with approximately 4.3 percentage points, according to experts Alan Gerber and Gregory Huber in 2016 while a 2013 study of 71 canvasses including many that targeted low propensity voters found turnout increased by 2‚Äì3 percentage points. Even earlier, analysts had often concluded that personal canvassing produced far higher voter turnout rates, such as 9.8‚Äì12.8%. While most experiments have been conducted in the US, recent studies have found similar or somewhat smaller effects in Europe. The guide to grassroots elections Get Out the Vote determined that GOTV efforts averaged one vote every 15 door knocks by volunteers ($31 dollars per vote), 35 phone calls by volunteers ($35 dollars per vote), or 273 pieces of nonpartisan direct mail ($91 dollars per vote, no effect from partisan direct mail). They note that campaigns which experiment carefully can do better than these averages. Campaigns can raise turnout up to 8 percentage points with direct mail which tells neighbors when other neighbors have voted and promises to mail an update after the election, though people complain when they have no way to opt in or out of notification. Other studies have found that GOTV methods contribute little to none to voter turnout. One field experiment found that GOTV phone calls were largely ineffective, and that ease of access to polling locations had the largest impact on voter turnout. There is also the argument that GOTV targets a more affluent demographic, which is already more likely to vote. Less politically engaged demographic and socioeconomic groups are sometimes neglected in GOTV efforts. GOTV is often most effective when potential voters are told to do so \\"because others will ask.\\" Voters will then go to the polls as a means of fulfilling perceived societal expectations. Paradoxically, informing voters that turnout is expecting to be high was found to increase actual voter turnout, while predicting lower turnouts actually resulted in less voters. In 2004, Rock the Vote paid to run TV ads aimed at young voters, on a random sample of small cable systems where they could measure the effects. Turnout was three percentage points higher among 18-19-year olds in these sample areas than in the control group covered by other similar small cable systems; there was less effect above age 22. In November 2012 and 2013, Rock the Vote experimented with Facebook ads to encourage voter turnout by telling people the number of days remaining until the election and which of their friends \\"liked\\" the countdown. The ads were shown to over 400,000 adults, randomly selected from a base over 800,000. Rock the Vote had helped many of them register. The ads did not increase turnout in the experimental group, compared to the control group who did not get the ads. In 2012 they also experimented with text message reminders to 180,000 people who had provided their mobile numbers. Texts the day before the election raised turnout six tenths of a percentage point, while texts on election day lowered turnout. Several mobile apps tell people where to vote, identify their elected officials, or search candidates' positions, though no evidence measures how much these raise turnout. Facebook apps let users see who their friends endorse, which gives them a shortcut in deciding whom to vote for. Studies in 2012 and 2017 found that Facebook's \\"I'm Voting/I'm a Voter\\" button increased turnout in the 2010 Congressional elections by six tenths of a percentage point, and in the 2012 presidential election by a quarter of a percentage point. It named their friends who had clicked the voting button, thus opting in and minimizing complaints. However the button only appeared on election day, so it did not let friends track and encourage each other throughout the early voting period which most states have. It has been used in many elections throughout the world since then, without clarity on which users see it, leading to concerns on how it biases turnout. Groups such as Postcards To Voters send handwritten postcards to potential voters ahead of elections in hopes of increasing turnout. A 2007 study showed that handwritten notes were three times as effective as machine-printed ones. == See also == * Canvassing, an integral precursor to a GOTV operation * Election campaigns * Issue advocacy * List of democracy and elections-related topics * Street money * Voter registration in the United States == References == == External links == * Tilting the Playing Field: Voter ID & Turnout * US Federal and State Voter ID Requirements Category:Election campaigning Category:Political catchphrases ","title":"Get out the vote"},{"id":"823321","text":"Chestnuts Long Barrow, also known as Stony Warren or Long Warren, is a chambered long barrow near the village of Addington in the south-eastern English county of Kent. Probably constructed in the fifth millennium BC, during Britain's Early Neolithic period, today it survives only in a ruined state. Archaeologists have established that long barrows were built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Representing an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe, Chestnuts Long Barrow belongs to a localised regional style of barrows produced in the vicinity of the River Medway. The long barrows built in this area are now known as the Medway Megaliths. Chestnuts Long Barrow lies near to both Addington Long Barrow and Coldrum Long Barrow on the western side of the river. Two further surviving long barrows, Kit's Coty House and Little Kit's Coty House, as well as the destroyed Smythe's Megalith and possible survivals as the Coffin Stone and White Horse Stone, are on the eastern side of the Medway. The long barrow was built on land previously inhabited in the Mesolithic period. It consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus, estimated to have been in length, with a chamber built from sarsen megaliths on its eastern end. Both inhumed and cremated human remains were placed within this chamber during the Neolithic period, representing at least nine or ten individuals. These remains were found alongside pottery sherds, stone arrow heads, and a clay pendant. In the 4th century AD, a Romano-British hut was erected next to the long barrow. In the 12th or 13th century, the chamber was dug into and heavily damaged, either by treasure hunters or iconoclastic Christians. The mound gradually eroded and was completely gone by the twentieth century, leaving only the ruined stone chamber. The ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the 18th and 19th centuries, while archaeological excavation took place in 1957, followed by limited reconstruction. The site is on privately owned land. == Name and location == Chestnuts Long Barrow is a scheduled ancient monument, standing on private land belonging to a neighbouring house, Rose Alba. It lies on the slope of a hill and borrows its name from the Chestnuts, an area of woodland that crowns the hill. This name was given to the monument in the mid-20th century; it had previously been known as Stony Warren or Long Warren. The barrow is in the greensand belt, above sea level. The underlying geology is a soft sandstone covered with a stratum of white sand. == Background == The Early Neolithic was a revolutionary period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. The change came about through contact with continental European societies, although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent. The region of modern Kent would have been key for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent. Britain was then largely forested; widespread forest clearance did not occur in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c. 1000 to 700 BCE). Environmental data from the vicinity of the White Horse Stone, a putatively prehistoric monolith near the River Medway, supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel/alder and Amygdaloideae (stone-fruit trees). Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the island's Early Neolithic economy was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life. === Medway Megaliths === alt=A map of Western Europe with certain areas highlighted in dark green. Across Western Europe, the Early Neolithic marked the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape. These structures included chambered long barrows, rectangular or oval earthen tumuli that had a chamber built into one end. Some of these chambers were constructed out of timber, while others were built using large stones, now known as \\"megaliths\\". These long barrows often served as tombs, housing the physical remains of the dead within their chamber. Individuals were rarely buried alone in the Early Neolithic, instead being interred in collective burials with other members of their community. These chambered tombs were built all along the Western European seaboard during the Early Neolithic, from southeastern Spain up to southern Sweden, taking in most of the British Isles; the architectural tradition was introduced to Britain from continental Europe in the first half of the fourth millennium BC. Although now all in a ruinous state, at the time of construction the Medway Megaliths would have been some of the largest and most visually imposing Early Neolithic funerary monuments in Britain. Grouped along the River Medway as it cuts through the North Downs, they constitute the most southeasterly group of megalithic monuments in the British Isles, and the only megalithic group in eastern England. The Medway Megaliths can be divided into two clusters between and apart: one to the west of the River Medway and the other on Blue Bell Hill to the east. Chestnuts Long Barrow is part of the western group, which also includes Coldrum Long Barrow and Addington Long Barrow. The eastern group consists of Smythe's Megalith, Kit's Coty House, and Little Kit's Coty House, while various stones on the eastern side of the river, most notably the Coffin Stone and White Horse Stone, may also have been parts of such structures. It is not known if they were all built at the same time, or whether they were constructed in succession; nor is it known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage. alt=A map featuring a river moving from the top of the image (north) to the bottom right corner (southeast). Various black dots mark out the location of Medway Megaliths on either side of the river. The Medway long barrows all conformed to the same general design plan, and are all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at the eastern end of the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. They had internal heights of up to , making them taller than most other chambered long barrows in Britain. The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of sand from the Eocene epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them to the site of the monument to be erected. These common architectural features among the Medway Megaliths indicate a strong regional cohesion with no direct parallels elsewhere in the British Isles. Nevertheless, as with other regional groupings of Early Neolithic long barrows‚Äîsuch as the Cotswold-Severn group in south-western Britain‚Äîthere are also various idiosyncrasies in the different monuments, such as Coldrum's rectilinear shape, the Chestnut Long Barrow's facade, and the long, thin mounds at Addington and Kit's Coty. These variations might have been caused by the tombs being altered and adapted over the course of their use; in this scenario, the monuments would be composite structures. The Medway Megaliths' builders were probably influenced by pre-existing tomb-shrines elsewhere that they were aware of. Whether the builders had grown up locally, or moved into the Medway area from elsewhere is not known. Based on a stylistic analysis of their architectural designs, the archaeologist Stuart Piggott thought that the plan behind the Medway Megaliths had originated in the area around the Low Countries, while fellow archaeologist Glyn Daniel instead believed that the same evidence showed an influence from Scandinavia. John H. Evans instead suggested an origin in Germany, and Ronald F. Jessup thought that their origins could be seen in the Cotswold-Severn megalithic group. Alexander thought that they bore closest similarities with long barrows along the Atlantic coast, perhaps imitating those of either Ireland or Brittany. The archaeologist Paul Ashbee noted that their close clustering in the same area was reminiscent of the megalithic tomb-shrine traditions of continental Northern Europe, and emphasised that the Medway Megaliths were a regional manifestation of a tradition widespread across Early Neolithic Europe. He nevertheless stressed that a precise place of origin was \\"impossible to indicate\\" with the available evidence. == Design and construction == View looking west across the burial chamber with the facade stones visible on either side Archaeological excavation revealed a Mesolithic layer below the monument, evidenced by much debris produced by flint knapping. During the 1957 excavation of the site, 2,300 Mesolithic flint fragments were found beneath it. Many more have been discovered in test trenches around the area, stretching up the hill towards Chestnuts Wood and for at least east of the tomb and south-west of it. Around west of the long barrow, excavation revealed flints in association with what was interpreted as a Mesolithic hearth. The large quantities of Mesolithic material, coupled with its broad spread, indicated that the site was probably inhabited over a considerable length of time during the Mesolithic period. Some trenches excavated in 1957 had Mesolithic flints directly below the megaliths, leading the excavator John Alexander to believe that \\"no great interval of time separated\\" the Mesolithic and Neolithic uses of the site. Chestnuts Long Barrow was constructed in particularly close proximity to Addington Long Barrow. The chamber was built with sarsen stones that occur naturally within a few miles of the site. These were arranged as two trilithons, next to each other, so that the two lintel stones formed the roof of the chamber. The chamber was trapezoidal in shape, measuring about in length, in width, and probably in height. It was oriented almost east to west, and as with four other Medway Megaliths, it appears to have been facing toward either the Medway Valley or the North Downs. It is probable that the chamber's entrance was almost entirely blocked by a large stone. While it is difficult to determine the chamber's precise original layout due to damage caused in the medieval period, it is probable that a medial stone divided the chamber in two. A dry stone wall across the west end of the chamber would have also blocked access. Plan of the long barrow's chamber based on that provided by the excavator John Alexander; black stones were those that had been pulled vertical but still stood in their original position; grey stones are those of unclear original position; the green areas mark robber trenches made in the Middle Ages. Alexander suggested that the earthen mound was constructed before the chamber, and that it was used as a ramp on which to drag the large stones into position. He suggested that the long barrow's builders kept the megaliths in place by filling the chamber with sand. Once the capstone was placed atop and the chamber was stable, he thought, the builders would have removed the supporting sand. In 1950, it was stated that 14 stones survived, however full excavation revealed that 18 large sarsen boulders were extant, alongside four smaller sarsen stones used in the dry stone wall and pavement of the tomb. The chamber had a pavement set in yellow sand, onto which human remains were placed. These human remains were evidenced by the discovery of 3,500 pieces of bone, reflecting a minimum of nine or ten individuals, at least one of whom was a child. Some of these burials were inhumed, and others were cremated, while the earlier bones were deposited alongside Windmill Hill pottery. Little evidence of inhumed burials was found, in part because they did not survive well in the acidic soils surrounding the site. The appearance of cremated human bone here is unusual; although evidence of cremation has been found at some other long barrows, generally it is rare in Early Neolithic Britain. Ashbee suggested that for this reason, the inclusion of cremated bone here must have had \\"especial significance\\". While acknowledging that there was evidence of Early Neolithic cremation at certain sites in Britain, the archaeologists Martin Smith and Megan Brickley suggested that the cremated bone was added later, during the Late Neolithic, when cremation was more common. Along with the human remains were found items probably interred with the dead, such as 34 sherds of ceramic, three stone arrow heads, and a clay pendant. In the forecourt of the site, excavators found 100 sherds of Windmill Hill ware, representing parts of at least eight bowls. Alexander suggested that these were once placed in the chamber but later removed to allow the deposition of further human remains inside it. Although no visible tumulus survived into the 1950s, the name \\"Long Warren\\" suggested that knowledge of such a mound had persisted into the 18th century. Excavation found evidence of the northern and eastern edges of the barrow, but all trace of its western and southern ends had been destroyed by levelling and deep ploughing. The barrow was probably trapezoidal or D-shaped, with a width of about . At its widest, opposite the fa√ßade, this may have extended to . It was more difficult to determine the long barrow's length, although Alexander suggested that it may have been about . === Meaning and purpose === Britain's Early Neolithic communities placed greater emphasis on the ritual burial of the dead than their Mesolithic forebears. Archaeologists have suggested that this is because Early Neolithic Britons adhered to an ancestor cult that venerated the spirits of the dead, believing that they could intercede with the forces of nature for the benefit of their living descendants. The archaeologist Robin Holgate stressed that rather than simply being tombs, the Medway Megaliths were \\"communal monuments fulfilling a social function for the communities who built and used them\\". Thus, it has been suggested that Early Neolithic people entered into the tombs‚Äîwhich doubled as temples or shrines‚Äîto perform rituals honouring the dead and requesting their assistance. For this reason, the historian Ronald Hutton termed these monuments \\"tomb-shrines\\" to reflect their dual purpose. In Britain, these tombs were typically located on prominent hills and slopes overlooking the landscape, perhaps at the junction between different territories. The archaeologist Caroline Malone noted that the tombs would have served as one of various landscape markers that conveyed information on \\"territory, political allegiance, ownership, and ancestors\\". Many archaeologists have subscribed to the idea that these tomb-shrines were territorial markers between different tribes; others have argued that such markers would be of little use to a nomadic herding society. Instead it has been suggested that they represent markers along herding pathways. The archaeologist Richard Bradley suggested that the construction of these monuments reflects an attempt to mark control and ownership over the land, thus reflecting a change in mindset brought about by the transition from the hunter-gatherer Mesolithic to the pastoralist Early Neolithic. Others have suggested that these monuments were built on sites already deemed sacred by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. == Later history == A photograph of the long barrow taken in the mid 1920s, prior to the site's reconstruction during the 1950s During excavation of the site, four ceramic sherds were found nearby which the excavator believed were possibly Early Iron Age in origin. Excavation also revealed 830 ceramic sherds dating from Roman Britain; these reflected all four centuries of this period, although the majority were 4th century. Also dated to the 4th century was a hut erected on a flat area adjacent to the barrow. Excavation of this hut uncovered 750 ceramic sherds, charcoal, iron nails, burnt clay, bone, and flint fragments. Examining this assemblage of artefacts, the excavator noted that it was not typical of the item assemblages usually found at Romano-British settlement sites, implying that the building was a field shelter rather than a house. Evidence for human activity near the barrow from the 11th through to the 13th century‚Äîduring the Middle Ages‚Äîappeared in the form of 200 ceramic sherds, two hones, and 17 fragments of daub found by archaeologists in the top soil. It was probably in this medieval period that the tomb was heavily destroyed, since medieval material was found in some of the pits created by those damaging the chamber and barrow. The destruction was carried out in a systematic manner. Initially, the barrow around the chamber was dug away, and an entrance into it was forced through the drystone wall at the north-western end. The chamber was then cleared down to the bedrock, with the spoil and contents of the chamber dumped behind the diggers. The medial stone of the chamber was pushed atop the spoil heap, and covered over with soil. A pit was dug in the centre of the chamber, and against its walls from the outside; the central pit was then sealed by the collapsing capstones. Finally, several pits were dug around the fa√ßade stones. Subsequently, the chamber collapsed, with several stones breaking on the impact of the fall. At some point after they had fallen, the inner pair of the chamber's tall stones were further damaged, likely in a process involving heating them with fire and then casting cold water onto them, resulting in breakage. View looking east through the burial chamber of Chestnuts Long Barrow From the available evidence, it was clear that this demolition was not carried out with the intent of collecting building stone nor for the clearance of ground for cultivation. Alexander believed the damage to the chamber was the result of robbery. Supporting this idea is comparative evidence, with the Close Roll of 1237 ordering the opening of barrows on the Isle of Wight in search for treasure, a practice which may have spread to Kent around the same time. Alexander believed that the destruction may have been brought about by a special commissioner, highlighting that the \\"expertness and thoroughness of the robbery\\" would have required more resources than a local community could muster. He further suggested that the individuals who damaged the monument might have also been responsible for the damage at Kit's Coty House, Coldrum Long Barrow, and Addington Long Barrow, while Ashbee suggested that the same could also be the case for Lower Kit's Coty House. Rather than robbery, Ashbee thought iconoclasm was the probable cause of the medieval damage to the chamber. He suggested that the burial of the stones indicated that Christian zealots had tried to deliberately destroy and defame the pre-Christian monument. Excavation also revealed evidence for modern activity around the site. Three post-medieval pits were identified in and around the barrow, as well as a post-medieval attempt to dig into the chamber. Finds from this period included ceramic sherds, clay pipes dated from between the 17th and 19th centuries, stone and clay marbles, brick tile, and bottles dated from between the 18th and 20th centuries. Alexander suggested that this evidence confirmed local accounts that Chestnuts Long Barrow had been used as a popular spot for picnics. There are also accounts that it was used as a well-known rabbit warren; during the late 19th century, the field was used as a paddock. == Folklore == In a 1946 paper published in the Folklore journal, John H. Evans recorded a Kentish folk belief which had been widespread \\"up to the last generation\\". This held that it was impossible to successfully count the number of stones in the Medway Megaliths. The countless stones motif is not unique to Kent, having been recorded at other megalithic monuments in Britain and Ireland. The earliest textual evidence for it is in an early 16th-century document, where it applies to Stonehenge in Wiltshire, although an early 17th- century document also applied it to The Hurlers, a set of three stone circles in Cornwall. Later records reveal that the folk story had gained widespread distribution in England and single occurrences in both Wales and Ireland. The folklorist S. P. Menefee suggested that it could be attributed to an animistic understanding that these megaliths had lives of their own. == Antiquarian and archaeological investigation == Finds from the 1957 excavation are stored at Maidstone Museum Antiquarians have been aware of Chestnuts Long Barrow since the 18th century. The earliest possible reference to the monuments was provided by the antiquarian John Harris in an ambiguous comment in his History of Kent in Five Parts, published in 1719. In 1773, the site was described in print by the antiquarian Josiah Colebrooke in a short article for Archaeologia, the journal of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He described it as one of the \\"temples of the antient Britons\\". Colebrook's analysis was echoed in the 18th-century writings of Edward Hasted, W. H. Ireland, and John Thorpe. In the early 1840s, the Reverend Beale Post conducted investigations into the Medway Megaliths, writing them up in a manuscript that was left unpublished; this included Addington Long Barrow and Chestnuts Long Barrow, which he collectively labelled the \\"Addington Circles\\". In the late 1940s, the site was visited by the archaeologists John H. Evans and Albert Egges van Giffen, with the former commenting that they examined the site in its \\"overgrown state\\". In 1953, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell reported that several small trees and bushes had grown up within the megaliths. That year, the field was prepared for horticultural use, being levelled and ploughed, although the area around the megaliths was left undisturbed. At this time, 16 megaliths were visible, lying at various angles. A high holly tree stood in the centre of them, and there was no sign of a mound. The landowner, Richard Boyle, opened a few test trenches in the area, during which he discovered Mesolithic flint tools. A large number of surface finds were discovered in both the field and a quarry to the east. In the latter part of the 1950s, with plans afoot to build a house adjacent to Chestnuts Long Barrow, the Inspectorate of Ancient Monuments initiated an excavation of the site under the directorship of John Alexander. The excavation, which lasted five weeks in August and September 1957, was funded by Boyle, with the support of the Inspectorate, and largely carried out by volunteers. Following excavation, the fallen sarsen megaliths were re-erected in their original sockets, allowing for the restoration of part of the chamber and fa√ßade. The finds recovered from the excavation were placed in Maidstone Museum. Alexander's subsequent excavation report was described by Ashbee as \\"comprehensive\\" and \\"a model of its kind\\", and by Jessup as \\"a notable example of modern archaeology in the field\\". == References  Footnotes = Bibliography === : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : == External links == * Chestnuts Long Barrow at The Megalithic Portal * Chestnuts Long Barrow at The Modern Antiquarian Category:Archaeological sites in Kent Category:Barrows in the United Kingdom Category:Megalithic monuments in England Category:Stone Age sites in Kent Category:Tonbridge and Malling ","title":"Chestnuts Long Barrow"},{"id":"823324","text":"GOTV may refer to: * Get out the vote, the effort of a political campaign to increase voter participation * GoTV Networks, a mobile content company * Gathering of the Vibes, a music festival * GoTV, an Austrian music channel * Counter Strike: Global Offensive TV, is a system used so players that do not participate in a game are allowed to watch the game progress *GOtv, a digital terrestrial television platform operated by MultiChoice that broadcasts in 11 African countries.

Despite being far from the city centre, Kartal is heavily populated (total population of 541,209) (2008 census). The total land area is 147,000 m2 which includes some countryside areas inland. Her neighbours are Maltepe the west, Sultanbeyli and Sancaktepe the north and Pendik the east. It was the neighbour of Gebze (1923‚Äì1987), ≈ûile (1923‚Äì1987), Beykoz (1928‚Äì1987), √úsk√ºdar (1923‚Äì1987), √úmraniye (1987‚Äì2009) and Kadƒ±k√∂y (1928‚Äì1992 and 2004‚Äì2009). It was a neighbour again with Kadƒ±k√∂y from the northwest due to Ferhatpa≈üa quarter passed from Maltepe to Samandƒ±ra in 2004. However, this neighbourhood was ended with Ata≈üehir's separation from Kadƒ±k√∂y and Samandƒ±ra's separation (joined to Sancaktepe) from Kartal in 2009. ==History== The center of Kartal (meaning 'eagle' in Turkish) was a fishing village on the Marmara shore during the Byzantine Empire called Kartalimen or Kartalimin in Greek, and was founded at the beginning of the 6th century. In the 11th century, the town was conquered by the ruler of the Seljuks, Suleyman Shah, and then in 1329 Kartal became part of the Ottoman Empire (however, the Byzantines re-took the city in 1403 and held it for 17 years). According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the kaza of Kartal had a total population of 12.969, consisting of 6.920 Greeks, 5.095 Muslims, 869 Armenians, 3 Catholics, 1 Jew and 81 foreign citizens.Kemal Karpat (1985), Ottoman Population, 1830-1914, Demographic and Social Characteristics, The University of Wisconsin Press, p. 138-139 By 1947, Kartal was an industrial area and with the introduction of commuter trains to Haydarpa≈üa Terminal from Gebze in 1973, Kartal became even more important as an industrial area of Istanbul. The current trend is that as more and more housing is built near the coast, factories there are being closed down and moved inland. For example, the large cement factory on the shore, which is to be converted into a cultural center, was closed in 2003. There is an historical Roman bath ruin near the Dragos Hill, which was under use of late Roman era is recovering by the Istanbul Archaeology Museums with the financial support of Kartal Municipality. ==Living in Kartal today== Kartal is on the sea and there are ferries to Adalar (Princes' Islands) and to Yalova. But most people travel by road, it is easy to get from Kartal to both the D 100, the main road from Anatolia to the Bosphorus Bridge, and to the TEM, the large motorway which crosses the Bosphorus via the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge. Also the coast road from Tuzla to Bostancƒ± is another important route. The Sabiha G√∂k√ßen International Airport at Kurtk√∂y, Pendik, is 15 minutes away. Finally, when the Marmaray project is completed it will be possible to reach the European side of Istanbul by a commuter rail system without interchange. Kartal is the terminal station of Kartal - Kadƒ±k√∂y metro (M4). Haydarpa≈üa-Gebze Line for commuter trains also pass through Kartal. With all these transport options Kartal is becoming heavily populated despite being far away from the centre of Istanbul. Luxury apartment complexes have been built on the coast, along with much more housing inland and this has attracted more shops and infrastructure. There are a number of well-known private and state schools in the area, Maltepe University and Suleyman Sah University are the private universities of Kartal. Housing is of good-quality in general. Building near the coast slowed after the 1999 earthquake, when people became very aware that a major fault line runs just off this coast. However, building on the high ground inland is proceeding apace and Kartal is projected to be a major urban and industrial area by the 2020s. The park around Ayazma Fountain in Yakacik is a popular picnic spot for Kartal's people. ==The Kartal Urban City Project== On 4 June 2007, the Greater Istanbul Municipality and the former mayor of Kartal announced that a new futuristic type urban city environment would be built in Kartal-Pendik. The city will be built on an area which is currently an abandoned industrial site. Upon completion, Kartal will be the new centre of Asian Istanbul. It is intended that the new city will be the world's first fully green \\"city\\". The plan includes a central business district, luxury residential developments, cultural facilities such as concert halls, museums, and theatres, and leisure locations including a marina and tourist hotels.Zaha Hadid Architects Kartal - Pendik Masterplan . ==Geography== Behind the coast the land rises sharply up to Yakacƒ±k Hill (\\"the balcony of Istanbul\\") and Aydos, on these hills the land is fertile and has a mild climate. The coast of Kartal has sandy and clay soils, whereas the northern part of the district is mostly silica. On the Yakacƒ±k Hill, there are limestone and quartz deposits. *Waters: The streams of Pa≈üak√∂y, Kavaklƒ±dere and Fƒ±ndƒ±klƒ± feed the reservoir behind the √ñmerli Dam. ==Religion== The major population of today's Kartal are Muslims.

The organization worked to educate young Jewish travelers and volunteers in favor of Orthodox Judaism. It later expanded worldwide, and continues promotes its extensive adult education classes. After Noah Weinberg died in February 2009, his son Rabbi Hillel Weinberg served as interim dean for a few years. In 2019, Rabbi Yitzchak Berkovits was named rosh yeshiva. ==Philosophy== Aish HaTorah describes itself as blending the traditions of the Lithuanian yeshivas with the doctrines of Hasidism. Weinberg himself was a product of Lithuanian schools but he was also a grandson of the Slonimer Rebbe. His teachings reflect influences of both schools as well as certain facets of the Kabbalah of Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, the Vilna Gaon and others. Aish HaTorah describes itself as pro-Israel and encourages Jewish people to visit Israel and connect to the land and its history. The organization's stated mission is \\"providing opportunities for Jews of all backgrounds to discover their heritage.\\" The organization is politically conservative and its officials have stated they oppose a full hand over of the West Bank to the Palestinians. ==Programs== Aish HaTorah operates about 35 full-time branches on five continents, providing seminars, singles events, executive learning groups, Shabbat and Jewish holiday programs, and community building. ===Jerusalem=== In Jerusalem, the Aish HaTorah yeshiva offers both beginners' \\"drop-in classes\\" and full-time, intensive study programs for Jewish men and women of all backgrounds and levels of knowledge. See Yeshiva#Curriculum. The offering extends through a 2-year semikhah (rabbinic ordination) program; participants are tested by the posek Zalman Nechemia Goldberg.

The campus houses the Kirk Douglas Theatre, which houses a dramatic film presentation of the Jewish contribution to humanity. Aish HaTorah runs the Discovery Seminar. The four- hour seminar reviews Jewish history, Jewish philosophy, and Jewish philosophy questions. ===Films=== In 2005 Aish HaTorah produced a documentary film, Inspired which chronicles the lives of selected baalei teshuvah (\\"returnees to Jewish observance\\"). Aish HaTorah believes that the high rate of intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews has diluted the Jewish people's vitality. Inspired was produced to encourage more observant Jews to share their positive Jewish religious experiences of Jewish life with non-observant Jews, as a way to strengthen the baal teshuva movement and revitalize Jewish life. In 2007 Aish released a sequel, Inspired Too. These films paved the way for Project Inspire, the grassroots organization that helps inspire Orthodox Jews to reach out to non-affiliated Jews to teach them about their heritage. Once an offshoot of Aish HaTorah, Project Inspire is now an independent organization under the umbrella of Aish Global. In 2008, the Clarion Project, an organization that formerly shared staff, fundraising sources and an address with Aish HaTorah, and has been linked in media reports with Aish HaTorah, distributed its film, Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West. The film had been criticized for being unfair in its portrayal of Muslims as violent. The film was sent to more than 28 million people in the United States in anticipation of the United States presidential election. Aish HaTorah denied any connection to the film. The Council on American‚ÄìIslamic Relations filed a complaint about the film with the Federal Election Commission. ===Hasbara Fellowships=== When the Israeli Foreign Ministry sought to combat anti-Israel ideas on college campuses, it worked with Aish HaTorah to develop the Hasbara Fellowships. This program has flown hundreds of student leaders to Israel for intensive training in pro-Israel activism training. In North America, Hasbara Fellowships guides and funds pro-Israel activities on over 100 college campuses. ===The Israel-Diaspora Initiative=== In August 2016, the Israeli government announced an Israel-Diaspora outreach program called The Israel-Diaspora Initiative. The program partners were announced as Chabad and Olami Worldwide, an organization that works closely with Aish. ===Aish Gesher=== Aish Gesher is an English speaking Yeshiva for young men with a solid basis in Gemara and Halacha.

The popularization of this periodization in English has generally been credited to historian Peter Brown, after the publication of his seminal work The World of Late Antiquity (1971). Precise boundaries for the period are a continuing matter of debate, but Brown proposes a period between the 3rd and 8th centuries AD. Generally, it can be thought of as from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (235‚Äì284) to the early Muslim conquests in the mid-7th century East, or as roughly contemporary with the Sasanian Empire (224‚Äì651). In the West its end was earlier, with the start of the Early Middle Ages typically placed in the 6th century, or earlier on the edges of the Western Roman Empire. The Roman Empire underwent considerable social, cultural and organizational changes starting with the reign of Diocletian, who began the custom of splitting the Empire into Eastern and Western halves ruled by multiple emperors simultaneously. The Sasanian Empire supplanted the Parthian Empire and opened a new phase of the Roman‚ÄìPersian Wars, the Roman‚ÄìSasanian Wars. The divisions between the Greek East and Latin West became more pronounced. The Diocletianic Persecution in the early 4th century was ended by Galerius and under Constantine the Great, Christianity was made legal in the Empire. The 4th century Christianization of the Roman Empire was mirrored by the conversions of Mirian III of the Kingdom of Iberia and of the earlier Tiridates the Great of the Kingdom of Armenia and the later King ‚ÄòEzana of Ethiopia. During the late 4th century reign of Theodosius the Great, Nicene Christianity was proclaimed the state church of the Roman Empire. Constantine's new foundation of Constantinople became the permanent imperial residence in the East by the 5th century and superseded Rome as the largest city in the Late Roman Empire and the Mediterranean Basin. The longest Roman aqueduct system, the -long Aqueduct of Valens was constructed to supply it with water, and the tallest Roman triumphal columns were erected there. Migrations of Germanic, Hunnic, and Slavic tribes disrupted Roman rule from the late 4th century onwards, culminating first in the Sack of Rome by the Visigoths in 410 and subsequent Sack of Rome by the Vandals in 455, part of the eventual collapse of the Empire in the West itself by 476. The Western Empire was replaced by the so-called barbarian kingdoms, with the Arian Christian Ostrogothic Kingdom ruling Rome from Ravenna. The resultant cultural fusion of Greco-Roman, Germanic, and Christian traditions formed the foundations of the subsequent culture of Europe. Roman imperial rule continued in the East, and the Byzantine-Sasanian wars continued. In the 6th century, the campaigns of Justinian the Great led to the fall of the Ostrogothic and Vandal Kingdoms, and their reincorporation into the Empire, when city of Rome and much of Italy and North Africa returned to Roman control, and though most of Italy was soon part of the Kingdom of the Lombards, the Roman Exarchate of Ravenna endured, ensuring the so called Byzantine Papacy. The construction of Hagia Sophia, greatest example of Byzantine architecture, and the plague of Justinian, first outbreak of the centuries-long first plague pandemic both took place under Justinian and his Persian counterpart Khosrow I. At Ctesiphon, the Sasanians erected the Taq Kasra, the colossal iwan of which is the largest single-span vault of unreinforced brickwork in the world and the triumph of Sasanian architecture. In the 7th century the disastrous Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 602‚Äì628 and the campaigns of Khosrow II and Heraclius facilitated the emergence of Islam in the Arabian Peninsula during the lifetime of Muhammad. Subsequent Muslim conquests of the Levant and Persia, which overthrew the Sasanian Empire and permanently wrested two thirds of the Eastern Roman Empire's territory from Roman control, forming the Rashidun Caliphate. The Byzantine Empire under the Heraclian dynasty begins the middle Byzantine period, and together with the establishment of the later 7th century Umayyad Caliphate, generally marks the end of late antiquity. ==Terminology== The term Sp√§tantike, literally \\"late antiquity\\", has been used by German-speaking historians since its popularization by Alois Riegl in the early 20th century.A. Giardana, \\"Esplosione di tardoantico,\\" Studi storici 40 (1999). It was given currency in English partly by the writings of Peter Brown, whose survey The World of Late Antiquity (1971) revised the Gibbon view of a stale and ossified Classical culture, in favour of a vibrant time of renewals and beginnings, and whose The Making of Late Antiquity offered a new paradigm of understanding the changes in Western culture of the time in order to confront Sir Richard Southern's The Making of the Middle Ages.Glen W. Bowersock, \\"The Vanishing Paradigm of the Fall of Rome\\" Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 49.8 (May 1996:29‚Äì43) p. 34. The continuities between the later Roman Empire,The Oxford Centre for Late Antiquity dates this as follows: \\"The late Roman period (which we are defining as, roughly, AD 250‚Äì450)...\\" as it was reorganized by Diocletian (r. 284‚Äì305), and the Early Middle Ages are stressed by writers who wish to emphasize that the seeds of medieval culture were already developing in the Christianized empire, and that they continued to do so in the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantine Empire at least until the coming of Islam. Concurrently, some migrating Germanic tribes such as the Ostrogoths and Visigoths saw themselves as perpetuating the \\"Roman\\" tradition. While the usage \\"Late Antiquity\\" suggests that the social and cultural priorities of Classical Antiquity endured throughout Europe into the Middle Ages, the usage of \\"Early Middle Ages\\" or \\"Early Byzantine\\" emphasizes a break with the classical past, and the term \\"Migration Period\\" tends to de-emphasize the disruptions in the former Western Roman Empire caused by the creation of Germanic kingdoms within her borders beginning with the foedus with the Goths in Aquitania in 418.A recent thesis advanced by Peter Heather of Oxford posits the Goths, Hunnic Empire, and the Rhine invaders of 406 (Alans, Suevi, Vandals) as the direct causes of the Western Roman Empire's crippling; The Fall of the Roman Empire: a New History of Rome and the Barbarians, OUP 2005. The general decline of population, technological knowledge and standards of living in Europe during this period became the archetypal example of societal collapse for writers from the Renaissance. As a result of this decline, and the relative scarcity of historical records from Europe in particular, the period from roughly the early fifth century until the Carolingian Renaissance (or later still) was referred to as the \\"Dark Ages\\". This term has mostly been abandoned as a name for a historiographical epoch, being replaced by \\"Late Antiquity\\" in the periodization of the late West Roman Empire, the early Byzantine empire and the Early Middle Ages.Gilian Clark, Late Antiquity: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford 2011), pp. 1‚Äì2. == Religion == One of the most important transformations in Late Antiquity was the formation and evolution of the Abrahamic religions: Christianity, Rabbinic Judaism and, eventually, Islam. Constantine I at York, where he was proclaimed Augustus in 306 A milestone in the rise of Christianity was the conversion of Emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306‚Äì337) in 312, as claimed by his Christian panegyrist Eusebius of Caesarea, although the sincerity of his conversion is debated.Noel Lenski (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to the Age of Constantine (Cambridge University Press, 2006), \\"Introduction\\". .A. H.M. Jones, Constantine and the Conversion of Europe (University of Toronto Press, 2003), p. 73. . Constantine confirmed the legalization of the religion through the so-called Edict of Milan in 313, jointly issued with his rival in the East, Licinius (r. 308‚Äì324). By the late 4th century, Emperor Theodosius the Great had made Christianity the State religion, thereby transforming the Classical Roman world, which Peter Brown characterized as \\"rustling with the presence of many divine spirits.\\"Brown, Authority and the Sacred Constantine I was a key figure in many important events in Christian history, as he convened and attended the first ecumenical council of bishops at Nicaea in 325, subsidized the building of churches and sanctuaries such as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, and involved himself in questions such as the timing of Christ's resurrection and its relation to the Passover.Eusebius of Caesarea, Vita Constantini 3.5‚Äì6, 4.47 The birth of Christian monasticism in the deserts of Egypt in the 3rd century, which initially operated outside the episcopal authority of the Church, would become so successful that by the 8th century it penetrated the Church and became the primary Christian practice. Monasticism was not the only new Christian movement to appear in late antiquity, although it had perhaps the greatest influence. Other movements notable for their unconventional practices include the Grazers, holy men who ate only grass and chained themselves up;p. 96 Islam and Global Dialogue Roger Boase, Hassan Bin (FRW) Talal, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2010 the Holy Fool movement, in which acting like a fool was considered more divine than folly; and the Stylites movement, where one practitioner lived atop a 50-foot pole for 40 years. Late Antiquity marks the decline of Roman state religion, circumscribed in degrees by edicts likely inspired by Christian advisors such as Eusebius to 4th century emperors, and a period of dynamic religious experimentation and spirituality with many syncretic sects, some formed centuries earlier, such as Gnosticism or Neoplatonism and the Chaldaean oracles, some novel, such as hermeticism. Culminating in the reforms advocated by Apollonius of Tyana being adopted by Aurelian and formulated by Flavius Claudius Julianus to create an organized but short-lived pagan state religion that ensured its underground survival into the Byzantine age and beyond.Smith, Rowland B.E. Julian's Gods: Religion and Philosophy in the Thought and Action of Julian Many of the new religions relied on the emergence of the parchment codex (bound book) over the papyrus volumen (scroll), the former allowing for quicker access to key materials and easier portability than the fragile scroll, thus fueling the rise of synoptic exegesis, papyrology. Notable in this regard is the topic of the Fifty Bibles of Constantine. ===Laity vs clergy=== Within the recently legitimized Christian community of the 4th century, a division could be more distinctly seen between the laity and an increasingly celibate male leadership.Jerome of Stridon wrote in c. 406 the polemical treatise Against Vigilantius in order to, among other disputes concerning relics of the saints, promote the greater spiritual nature of celibacy over marriage These men presented themselves as removed from the traditional Roman motivations of public and private life marked by pride, ambition and kinship solidarity, and differing from the married pagan leadership. Unlike later strictures on priestly celibacy, celibacy in Late Antique Christianity sometimes took the form of abstinence from sexual relations after marriage, and it came to be the expected norm for urban clergy. Celibate and detached, the upper clergy became an elite equal in prestige to urban notables, the potentes or dynatoi (Brown (1987) p. 270). ===The rise of Islam=== Arabs conquered the provinces of Syria and Egypt ‚Äì the same time the early Slavs settled in the Balkans Islam appeared in the 7th century, spurring Arab armies to invade the Eastern Roman Empire and the Sassanian Empire of Persia, destroying the latter. After conquering all of North Africa and Visigothic Spain, the Islamic invasion was halted by Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours in modern France.For a thesis on the complementary nature of Islam to the absolutist trend of Christian monarchy, see Garth Fowden, Empire to Commonwealth: Consequences of Monotheism in Late Antiquity, Princeton University Press 1993 On the rise of Islam, two main theses prevail. On the one hand, there is the traditional view, as espoused by most historians prior to the second half of the twentieth century and by Muslim scholars. This view, the so-called \\"out of Arabia\\"-thesis, holds that Islam as a phenomenon was a new, alien element in the late antique world. Related to this is the Pirenne Thesis, according to which the Arab invasions marked‚Äîthrough conquest and the disruption of Mediterranean trade routes‚Äîthe cataclysmic end of Late Antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. On the other hand, there is the modern view, associated with scholars in the tradition of Peter Brown, in which Islam is seen to be a product of the Late Antique world, not foreign to it. This school suggests that its origin within the shared cultural horizon of the late antique world explains the character of Islam and its development. Such historians point to similarities with other late antique religions and philosophies‚Äîespecially Christianity‚Äîin the prominent role and manifestations of piety in Islam, in Islamic asceticism and the role of \\"holy persons\\", in the pattern of universalist, homogeneous monotheism tied to worldly and military power, in early Islamic engagement with Greek schools of thought, in the apocalypticism of Islamic theology and in the way the Quran seems to react to contemporary religious and cultural issues shared by the late antique world at large. Further indication that Arabia (and thus the environment in which Islam first developed) was a part of the late antique world is found in the close economic and military relations between Arabia, the Byzantine Empire and the Sassanian Empire.Robert Hoyland, 'Early Islam as a Late Antique Religion', in: Scott F. Johnson ed., The Oxford Handbook of Late Antiquity (Oxford 2012) pp. 1053‚Äì1077. ==Political transformations== Emperor Honorius, 1883: John William Waterhouse expresses the sense of moral decadence that coloured the 19th-century historical view of the 5th century. The Late Antique period also saw a wholesale transformation of the political and social basis of life in and around the Roman Empire. The Roman citizen elite in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, under the pressure of taxation and the ruinous cost of presenting spectacular public entertainments in the traditional cursus honorum, had found under the Antonines that security could only be obtained by combining their established roles in the local town with new ones as servants and representatives of a distant Emperor and his traveling court. After Constantine centralized the government in his new capital of Constantinople (dedicated in 330), the Late Antique upper classes were divided among those who had access to the far-away centralized administration (in concert with the great landowners), and those who did not‚Äîthough they were well-born and thoroughly educated, a classical education and the election by the Senate to magistracies was no longer the path to success. Room at the top of Late Antique society was more bureaucratic and involved increasingly intricate channels of access to the emperor: the plain toga that had identified all members of the Republican senatorial class was replaced with the silk court vestments and jewelry associated with Byzantine imperial iconography.Cf. the compendious list of ranks and liveries of imperial bureaucrats, the Notitia Dignitatum Also indicative of the times is the fact that the imperial cabinet of advisors came to be known as the consistorium, or those who would stand in courtly attendance upon their seated emperor, as distinct from the informal set of friends and advisors surrounding the Augustus. The ruins of the Taq Kasra in Ctesiphon, capital of the Sasanian Empire, photographed in 1864 ==Cities== The later Roman Empire was in a sense a network of cities. Archaeology now supplements literary sources to document the transformation followed by collapse of cities in the Mediterranean basin. Two diagnostic symptoms of decline‚Äîor as many historians prefer, 'transformation'‚Äîare subdivision, particularly of expansive formal spaces in both the domus and the public basilica, and encroachment, in which artisans' shops invade the public thoroughfare, a transformation that was to result in the souk (marketplace).'The changing city' in \\"Urban changes and the end of Antiquity\\", Averil Cameron, The Mediterranean World in Late Antiquity, AD 395‚Äì600, 1993:159ff, with notes; Hugh Kennedy, \\"From Polis to Madina: urban change in late Antique and early Islamic Syria\\", Past and Present 106 (1985:3‚Äì27). Burials within the urban precincts mark another stage in dissolution of traditional urbanistic discipline, overpowered by the attraction of saintly shrines and relics. In Roman Britain, the typical 4th- and 5th-century layer of dark earth within cities seems to be a result of increased gardening in formerly urban spaces. The city of Rome went from a population of 800,000 in the beginning of the period to a population of 30,000 by the end of the period, the most precipitous drop coming with the breaking of the aqueducts during the Gothic War. A similar though less marked decline in urban population occurred later in Constantinople, which was gaining population until the outbreak of plague in 541. In Europe there was also a general decline in urban populations. As a whole, the period of late antiquity was accompanied by an overall population decline in almost all Europe, and a reversion to more of a subsistence economy. Long-distance markets disappeared, and there was a reversion to a greater degree of local production and consumption, rather than webs of commerce and specialized production.See Bryan Ward-Perkins, The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization, OUP 2005 View west along the Harbour Street towards the Library of Celsus in Ephesus, present-day Turkey. The pillars on the left side of the street were part of the colonnaded walkway apparent in cities of Late Antique Asia Minor. Concurrently, the continuity of the Eastern Roman Empire at Constantinople meant that the turning-point for the Greek East came later, in the 7th century, as the Eastern Roman, or Byzantine Empire centered around the Balkans, North Africa (Egypt and Carthage), and Asia Minor. The degree and extent of discontinuity in the smaller cities of the Greek East is a moot subject among historians.Bibliography in Averil Cameron, The Mediterranean World in Late Antiquity, AD 395‚Äì600, 1993,:152 note 1. The urban continuity of Constantinople is the outstanding example of the Mediterranean world; of the two great cities of lesser rank, Antioch was devastated by the Persian sack of 540, followed by the plague of Justinian (542 onwards) and completed by earthquake, while Alexandria survived its Islamic transformation, to suffer incremental decline in favour of Cairo in the medieval period. Justinian rebuilt his birthplace in Illyricum, as Justiniana Prima, more in a gesture of imperium than out of an urbanistic necessity; another \\"city\\", was reputed to have been founded, according to Procopius' panegyric on Justinian's buildings,Procopius, Buildings of Justinian VI.6.15; Vandal Wars I.15.3ff, noted by Cameron 1993:158. precisely at the spot where the general Belisarius touched shore in North Africa: the miraculous spring that gushed forth to give them water and the rural population that straightway abandoned their ploughshares for civilised life within the new walls, lend a certain taste of unreality to the project. In mainland Greece, the inhabitants of Sparta, Argos and Corinth abandoned their cities for fortified sites in nearby high places; the fortified heights of Acrocorinth are typical of Byzantine urban sites in Greece. In Italy, populations that had clustered within reach of Roman roads began to withdraw from them, as potential avenues of intrusion, and to rebuild in typically constricted fashion round an isolated fortified promontory, or rocca; Cameron notes similar movement of populations in the Balkans, 'where inhabited centres contracted and regrouped around a defensible acropolis, or were abandoned in favour of such positions elsewhere.\\"Cameron 1993:159. Roman cavalry from a mosaic of the Villa Romana del Casale, Sicily, 4th century AD In the western Mediterranean, the only new cities known to be founded in Europe between the 5th and 8th centuries\\"Arte Visig√≥tico: Rec√≥polis\\" were the four or five Visigothic \\"victory cities\\".According to E. A Thompson, \\"The Barbarian Kingdoms in Gaul and Spain\\", Nottingham Mediaeval Studies, 7 (1963:4n11). Reccopolis in the province of Guadalajara is one: the others were Victoriacum, founded by Leovigild, which may survive as the city of Vitoria, though a 12th-century (re)foundation for this city is given in contemporary sources; Lugo id est Luceo in the Asturias, referred to by Isidore of Seville, and Ologicus (perhaps Ologitis), founded using Basque labour in 621 by Suinthila as a fortification against the Basques, modern Olite. All of these cities were founded for military purposes and at least Reccopolis, Victoriacum, and Ologicus in celebration of victory. A possible fifth Visigothic foundation is Baiyara (perhaps modern Montoro), mentioned as founded by Reccared in the 15th-century geographical account, Kitab al-Rawd al-Mitar.Jos√© Mar√≠a Lacarra, \\"Panorama de la historia urbana en la Pen√≠nsula Ib√©rica desde el siglo V al X,\\" La citt√† nell'alto medioevo, 6 (1958:319‚Äì358). Reprinted in Estudios de alta edad media espa√±ola (Valencia: 1975), pp. 25‚Äì90. The arrival of a highly urbanized Islamic culture in the decade following 711 ensured the survival of cities in the Hispaniae into the Middle Ages. Beyond the Mediterranean world, the cities of Gaul withdrew within a constricted line of defense around a citadel. Former imperial capitals such as Cologne and Trier lived on in diminished form as administrative centres of the Franks. In Britain, where the break with Late Antiquity comes earliest in the 5th and the 6th century, most towns cities had been in rapid decline during the 4th century during a time of prosperity until the very last decades of the century, well before the withdrawal of Roman governors and garrisons; historians emphasizing urban continuities with the Anglo-Saxon period depend largely on the post-Roman survival of Roman toponymy. Aside from a mere handful of its continuously inhabited sites, like York and London and possibly Canterbury, however, the rapidity and thoroughness with which its urban life collapsed with the dissolution of centralized bureaucracy calls into question the extent to which Roman Britain had ever become authentically urbanized: \\"in Roman Britain towns appeared a shade exotic,\\" observes H. R. Loyn, \\"owing their reason for being more to the military and administrative needs of Rome than to any economic virtue\\".Loyn 1991:15f. The other institutional power centre, the Roman villa, did not survive in Britain either.Loyn 1991:16. Gildas lamented the destruction of the twenty-eight cities of Britain; though not all in his list can be identified with known Roman sites, Loyn finds no reason to doubt the essential truth of his statement. Classical Antiquity can generally be defined as an age of cities; the Greek polis and Roman municipium were locally organised, self-governing bodies of citizens governed by written constitutions. When Rome came to dominate the known world, local initiative and control were gradually subsumed by the ever-growing Imperial bureaucracy; by the Crisis of the Third Century the military, political and economic demands made by the Empire had crushed the civic spirit, and service in local government came to be an onerous duty, often imposed as punishment. Harassed urban dwellers fled to the walled estates of the wealthy to avoid taxes, military service, famine and disease. In the Western Roman Empire especially, many cities destroyed by invasion or civil war in the 3rd century could not be rebuilt. Plague and famine hit the urban class in greater proportion, and thus the people who knew how to keep civic services running. Perhaps the greatest blow came in the wake of the extreme weather events of 535‚Äì536 and subsequent Plague of Justinian, when the remaining trade networks ensured the Plague spread to the remaining commercial cities. The impact of this outbreak of plague has recently been disputed. The end of Classical Antiquity is the end of the Polis model, and the general decline of cities is a defining feature of Late Antiquity. === Public building === In the cities the strained economies of Roman over-expansion arrested growth. Almost all new public building in Late Antiquity came directly or indirectly from the emperors or imperial officials. Attempts were made to maintain what was already there. The supply of free grain and oil to 20% of the population of Rome remained intact the last decades of the 5th century. It was once thought that the elite and rich had withdrawn to the private luxuries of their numerous villas and town houses. Scholarly opinion has revised this. They monopolized the higher offices in the imperial administration, but they were removed from military command by the late 3rd century. Their focus turned to preserving their vast wealth rather than fighting for it. The basilica, which had functioned as a law court or for imperial reception of foreign dignitaries, became the primary public building in the 4th century. Due to the stress on civic finances, cities spent money on walls, maintaining baths and markets at the expense of amphitheaters, temples, libraries, porticoes, gymnasia, concert and lecture halls, theaters and other amenities of public life. In any case as Christianity took over many of these building which were associated with pagan cults were neglected in favor of building churches and donating to the poor. The Christian basilica was copied from the civic structure with variations. The bishop took the chair in the apse reserved in secular structures for the magistrate‚Äîor the Emperor himself‚Äîas the representative here and now of Christ Pantocrator, the Ruler of All, his characteristic Late Antique icon. These ecclesiastical basilicas (e.g., St. John Lateran and St. Peter's in Rome) were themselves outdone by Justinian's Hagia Sophia, a staggering display of later Roman/Byzantine power and architectural taste, though the building is not architecturally a basilica. In the former Western Roman Empire almost no great buildings were constructed from the 5th century. A most outstanding example is the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna constructed circa 530 at a cost of 26,000 gold solidi or 360 Roman pounds of gold. City life in the East, though negatively affected by the plague in the 6th‚Äì7th centuries, finally collapsed due to Slavic invasions in the Balkans and Persian destructions in Anatolia in the 620s. City life continued in Syria, Jordan and Palestine into the 8th. In the later 6th century street construction was still undertaken in Caesarea Maritima in Palestine,Robert L. Vann, \\"Byzantine street construction at Caesarea Maritima\\", in R.L. Hohlfelder, ed. City, Town and Countryside in the Early Byzantine Ear 1982:167‚Äì70. and Edessa was able to deflect Chosroes I with massive payments in gold in 540 and 544, before it was overrun in 609.M. Whittow, \\"Ruling the late Roman and early Byzantine city: a continuous history\\", Past and Present 129 (1990:3‚Äì29). ==Sculpture and art== The Four Tetrarchs, in porphyry, later sacked from Constantinople, St. Marks, Venice As a complicated period bridging between Roman art and medieval art and Byzantine art, the Late Antique period saw a transition from the classical idealized realism tradition largely influenced by Ancient Greek art to the more iconic, stylized art of the Middle Ages. Unlike classical art, Late Antique art does not emphasize the beauty and movement of the body, but rather, hints at the spiritual reality behind its subjects. Additionally, mirroring the rise of Christianity and the collapse of the western Roman Empire, painting and freestanding sculpture gradually fell from favor in the artistic community. Replacing them were greater interests in mosaics, architecture, and relief sculpture. As the soldier emperors such as Maximinus Thrax (r. 235‚Äì238) emerged from the provinces in the 3rd century, they brought with them their own regional influences and artistic tastes. For example, artists jettisoned the classical portrayal of the human body for one that was more rigid and frontal. This is markedly evident in the combined porphyry Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs in Venice. With these stubby figures clutching each other and their swords, all individualism, naturalism, the verism or hyperrealism of Roman portraiture, and Greek idealism diminish. The Arch of Constantine in Rome, which re-used earlier classicising reliefs together with ones in the new style, shows the contrast especially clearly. In nearly all artistic media, simpler shapes were adopted and once natural designs were abstracted. Additionally hierarchy of scale overtook the preeminence of perspective and other classical models for representing spatial organization. From around 300 Early Christian art began to create new public forms, which now included sculpture, previously distrusted by Christians as it was so important in pagan worship. Sarcophagi carved in relief had already become highly elaborate, and Christian versions adopted new styles, showing a series of different tightly packed scenes rather than one overall image (usually derived from Greek history painting) as was the norm. Soon the scenes were split into two registers, as in the Dogmatic Sarcophagus or the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus (the last of these exemplifying a partial revival of classicism). Nearly all of these more abstracted conventions could be observed in the glittering mosaics of the era, which during this period moved from being decoration derivative from painting used on floors (and walls likely to become wet) to a major vehicle of religious art in churches. The glazed surfaces of the tesserae sparkled in the light and illuminated the basilica churches. Unlike their fresco predecessors, much more emphasis was placed on demonstrating a symbolic fact rather than on rendering a realistic scene. As time progressed during the Late Antique period, art become more concerned with biblical themes and influenced by interactions of Christianity with the Roman state. Within this Christian subcategory of Roman art, dramatic changes were also taking place in the Depiction of Jesus. Jesus Christ had been more commonly depicted as an itinerant philosopher, teacher or as the \\"Good Shepherd,\\" resembling the traditional iconography of Hermes. He was increasingly given Roman elite status, and shrouded in purple robes like the emperors with orb and scepter in hand. As for luxury arts, manuscript illumination on vellum and parchment emerged from the 5th century, with a few manuscripts of Roman literary classics like the Vergilius Vaticanus and the Vergilius Romanus, but increasingly Christian texts, of which Quedlinburg Itala fragment (420‚Äì430) is the oldest survivor. Carved ivory diptychs were used for secular subjects, as in the imperial and consular diptychs presented to friends, as well as religious ones, both Christian and pagan ‚Äì they seem to have been especially a vehicle for the last group of powerful pagans to resist Christianity, as in the late 4th century Symmachi‚ÄìNicomachi diptych. Extravagant hoards of silver plate are especially common from the 4th century, including the Mildenhall Treasure, Esquiline Treasure, Hoxne Hoard, and the imperial Missorium of Theodosius I. ==Literature== The Vienna Dioscurides, an early 6th-century illuminated manuscript of De Materia Medica by Dioscorides in Greek, a rare example of a late antique scientific text In the field of literature, Late Antiquity is known for the declining use of classical Greek and Latin, and the rise of literary cultures in Syriac, Armenian, Georgian, Ethiopic, Arabic, and Coptic. It also marks a shift in literary style, with a preference for encyclopedic works in a dense and allusive style, consisting of summaries of earlier works (anthologies, epitomes) often dressed up in elaborate allegorical garb (e.g., De nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae [The Marriage of Mercury and Philology] of Martianus Capella and the De arithmetica, De musica, and De consolatione philosophiae of Boethius‚Äîboth later key works in medieval education). The 4th and 5th centuries also saw an explosion of Christian literature, of which Greek writers such as Eusebius of Caesarea, Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus and John Chrysostom and Latin writers such as Ambrose of Milan, Jerome and Augustine of Hippo are only among the most renowned representatives.

Deriving from the earlier Colunwy, it shares its very early British root with the two rivers Colne, in Lancashire and Essex, each of which has a town of the same name on its banks.Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names Clun grew up around the site of a Saxon church towards the end of the 7th century AD. However, in the surrounding area there was a scattered population at least as early as the Neolithic period, about 5000 years ago. Clun was on the historic drove road where flocks and herds were driven from Wales to the markets in the Midlands and London. At the time of the Norman Conquest Clun formed part of the extensive lands of Eadric the Wild, who led a revolt against King William I, whereon his lands were confiscated and given to Roger de Montgomery who was created Earl of Shrewsbury. Roger in turn granted 27 manors, of which Clun was the largest, to Picot de Say.Open Domesday Online: Clun; accessed August 2018. These lands constituted a single Marcher Lordship which became known as the Barony of Clun. The Normans established a borough near the castle; the typical grid pattern is still visible in the layout of High Street, Newport Street, Kidd Lane, Powell's Lane, Ford Street and Hospital Lane. Clun Castle The 14th- century pack horse bridge that crosses the river connecting Saxon Clun to Norman Clun has given rise to a local saying: \\"whoever crosses Clun Bridge comes back sharper than he went\\".

It is one of the best-selling brands of bourbon in the world. Since 1795 (interrupted by Prohibition), seven generations of the Beam family have been involved in whiskey production for the company that produces the brand. The brand name became \\"Jim Beam\\" in 1943 in honor of James B. Beam, who rebuilt the business after Prohibition ended. Previously produced by the Beam family and later owned by the Fortune Brands holding company, the brand was purchased by Suntory Holdings in 2014. ==History== During the late 18th century, members of the B√∂hm family, who eventually changed the spelling of their surname to \\"Beam\\", emigrated from Germany and settled in Kentucky. Johannes \\"Jacob\\" Beam (1760‚Äì1834) was a farmer who began producing whiskey in the style that became bourbon. Jacob Beam sold his first barrels of corn whiskey around 1795, then called Old Jake Beam Sour Mash. Jacob Beam's son David Beam (1802‚Äì1854) took on his father's responsibilities in 1820 at the age of 18, expanding distribution of the family's bourbon during a time of Industrial Revolution. David M. Beam (1833‚Äì1913) in 1854 moved the distillery to Nelson County to capitalize on the growing network of railroad lines connecting states. Until 1880, customers would bring their own jugs to the distillery to fill them with whiskey. In 1880, the company started bottling the product and selling it nationally under the brand name \\"Old Tub\\". James Beauregard Beam (1864‚Äì1947) managed the family business before and after Prohibition, rebuilding the distillery in 1933‚Äì1934 in Clermont, Kentucky, near his Bardstown home. The James B. Beam Distilling Company was founded in 1935 by Harry L. Homel, Oliver Jacobson, Harry Blum, and Jeremiah Beam. In 1943, the brand name was changed from \\"Old Tub\\" to \\"Jim Beam\\", after James Beauregard Beam, and some of the bottle labels bear the statement, \\"None Genuine Without My Signature\\" with the signature James B. Beam. In 1945, the company was purchased by Harry Blum, a Chicago spirits merchant. The Beam company was purchased by American Brands in 1968. T. Jeremiah Beam (1899‚Äì1977) started working at the Clear Springs distillery in 1913, later becoming the master distiller and overseeing operations at the new Clermont facility. Jeremiah Beam eventually gained full ownership and opened a second distillery near Boston, Kentucky, in 1954. Jeremiah later teamed up with childhood friend Jimberlain Joseph Quinn, to expand the enterprise. Booker Noe (Frederick Booker Noe II, 1929‚Äì2004), grandson of Jim Beam, was the Master Distiller at the Jim Beam Distillery for more than 40 years, working closely with Master Distiller Jerry Dalton (1998‚Äì2007). In 1987 Booker introduced his namesake bourbon, Booker's, the company's first uncut, straight-from-the-barrel bourbon, and the first of the company's \\"Small Batch Bourbon Collection\\". Fred Noe (Frederick Booker Noe III, 1957‚Äì) became the seventh generation Beam family distiller in 2007 and regularly travels for promotional purposes. In 1987, Jim Beam purchased National Distillers, acquiring brands including Old Crow, Bourbon de Luxe, Old Taylor, Old Grand-Dad, and Sunny Brook. Old Taylor was subsequently sold to the Sazerac Company. On August 4, 2003, a fire destroyed a Jim Beam aging warehouse in Bardstown, Kentucky. It held 15,000 barrels () of bourbon. Flames rose more than 100 feet from the structure. Burning bourbon spilled from the warehouse into a nearby creek. An estimated 19,000 fish died of the bourbon in the creek and a river. Jim Beam was part of the holding company formerly known as Fortune Brands that was dismantled in 2011. Other parts of the remaining company were spun off as an IPO on the NYSE on the same day, as Fortune Brands Home & Security, and the liquor division of the holding company was renamed Beam, Inc. on October 4, 2011. In January 2014, it was announced that Beam Inc. would be purchased by Suntory Holdings Ltd., a Japanese group of brewers & distillers known for producing Japan's first whiskey. The combined company is known as Beam Suntory. On July 3, 2019, another warehouse caught ablaze which destroyed around 45,000 barrels () of bourbon. The fire led to the spillage of bourbon into the Kentucky River and Glenns Creek. Learning from the 2003 fire it was decided not to use water, letting it burn itself out to reduce runoff into the ecosystem. The estimated cost of the fire to Beam Suntory was around $45 million. The Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (KEEC) released a statement via their official Facebook page stating the alcohol plume has reached 23 miles between Owenton and Carrollton. The KEEC along with local and federal agencies used aeration to increase the oxygen levels in the water to prevent additional fish kill. ==Distillers== * Freddie Noe (1988‚ÄìPresent) * Fred Noe (1957‚ÄìPresent) * Fred Booker Noe II (1929 - 2004) * T.

Several of these offerings have performed quite well at international spirits ratings competitions. For example, Jim Beam's Black label was awarded a double gold medal at the 2009 San Francisco World Spirits Competition. Jim Beam Black also won a Gold Outstanding medal at the 2013 International Wine and Spirit Competition. ==Process== Bourbon whiskey distillers must follow government standards for production. By law (), any \\"straight\\" bourbon must be: produced in the United States; made of a grain mix of at least 51% corn; distilled at no higher than 160 proof (80% ABV); free of any additives (except water to reduce proof for aging and bottling); aged in new, charred white oak barrels; entered into the aging barrels at no higher than 125 proof (62.5% ABV), aged for a minimum of 2 years, and bottled at no less than 80 proof (40% ABV). Jim Beam starts with water filtered naturally by the limestone shelf found in Central Kentucky. A strain of yeast used since the end of Prohibition is added to a tank with the grains to create what is known as \\"dona yeast\\", used later in the fermentation process. Hammermills grind the mix of corn, rye and barley malt to break it down for easier cooking. The mix is then moved into a large mash cooker where water and set back are added. The \\"set back\\" is a portion of the old mash from the previous distillation‚Äîthe key step of the sour mash process, ensuring consistency from batch to batch. From the cooker, the mash heads to the fermenter where it is cooled to 60‚Äì70 ¬∞F and yeast is added again. The yeast is fed by the sugars in the mash, producing heat, carbon dioxide and alcohol. Called \\"distiller's beer\\" or \\"wash\\", the resulting liquid (after filtering to remove solids) looks, smells and tastes like (and essentially is) a form of beer. The wash is pumped into a column still where it is heated to over 200 ¬∞F, causing the alcohol to turn to a vapor. As the vapor cools and falls it turns to a liquid called \\"low wine\\", which measures 125 proof or 62.5% alcohol. A second distillation in a pot still heats and condenses the liquid into \\"high wine\\", which reaches 135 proof (67.5% alcohol). The high wine is moved to new, charred American oak barrels, each of which hold about 53 gallons of liquid. A \\"bung\\" is used to seal the barrels before moving them to nearby hilltop rackhouses where they will age up to nine years. As the seasons change, natural weather variations expand and contract the barrel wood, allowing bourbon to seep into the barrel, and the caramelized sugars from the charred oak flavor and color the bourbon. A significant portion (known as the \\"angel's share\\") of the 53 gallons of bourbon escapes the barrel through evaporation, or stays trapped in the wood of the barrel.Jim Beam Bourbon-Making Process, documented by Beam Global Spirits & Wine, September 2008 Jim Beam ages for at least four years, or twice as long as the government requires for a \\"straight\\" bourbon. Aging for at least 4 years also allows the distillery to legally dispense with an age statement on the bottle. At the end of the aging period the amber liquid is filtered, bottled, packaged and sent to one of many distributors around the world using the three-tier distribution system. ==Food and merchandise== Jim Beam bourbon and cola on display at a German market On July 26, 2004, Thanasi Foods announced the release of Jim Beam Soaked Sunflower Seeds, a snack product soaked in Jim Beam and available in 3 flavors; Original, Barbeque, and Jalape√±o.

While other sortes (means of fortune-telling) involved the casting of dice, the Sortes Astrampsychi did not. Instead, a questioner chose a prewritten question, to which a number was assigned; calling on divine inspiration, the questioner then spoke a number from one to ten, which was added to the question number; the oracle-monger then provided one of ten possible replies by consulting a numerical index.

Built at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on Badger's Island in Kittery, Maine, she is famed for the one-ship raiding campaign waged by her captain, Captain John Paul Jones, during naval operations of the American Revolutionary War.The Importance of Ranger, J. Dennis Robinson In six months spent primarily in British waters she captured five prizes (mostly merchantmen), staged a single failed attack on the English mainland at Whitehaven, and caused Royal Navy ships to be dispatched against her in the Irish Sea. Jones was detached in Brest, France to take charge of , turning over command of Ranger to his first officer, Lieutenant Thomas Simpson. Under Simpson Ranger went on to capture twenty-four more prizes abroad the Atlantic and along the U.S. coast during 1778 and 1779. Sent to the South in late 1779 to aid the U.S. garrison at Charleston, South Carolina, during the British siege, she continued her raiding career until ultimately forced to take station on the Cooper River, and was captured on May 11, 1780 with the fall of the city. She was brought into the Royal Navy as HMS Halifax. Decommissioned in 1781 in Portsmouth, England, she was sold that year as a merchant ship. ==History== Ranger (initially called Hampshire) was launched 10 May 1777 by James Hackett, master shipbuilder, at the shipyard of John Langdon on what is now called Badger's Island in Kittery, Maine; Captain John Paul Jones in command. ===Continental Navy=== After fitting out, she sailed for France on 1 November 1777, carrying dispatches telling of General Burgoyne's surrender to the commissioners in Paris. On the voyage over, two British prizes were captured. Ranger arrived at Nantes, France, 2 December, where Jones sold the prizes and delivered the news of the victory at Saratoga to Benjamin Franklin. On 14 February 1778, Ranger received a nine-gun salute to the new American flag, the \\"Stars and Stripes\\" from the ship of the line Robuste, under Lamotte-Picquet, at Quiberon Bay. This was the first salute from a warship and, the second to an American fighting vessel by a foreign power (the first salute was received by when on 16 November 1776 she arrived at St. Eustatius and the Dutch island returned her 11-gun salute). Ranger sailed from Brest 10 April 1778, for the Irish Sea and four days later captured a prize between the Scilly Isles and Cape Clear. On 17 April, she took another prize and sent her back to France. Captain Jones led a raid on the English port of Whitehaven, 23 April, spiking the guns of the fortress, but failing in his attempt to burn the ships in the harbor. Sailing across the bay to St. Mary's Isle, Scotland, the American captain planned to seize the Earl of Selkirk and hold him as a hostage and use him to make several political demands. However, since the Earl was absent, the plan failed. Several Royal Navy vessels were searching for Ranger, and Captain Jones sailed across the North Channel to Carrickfergus, Ireland, to induce of 14 guns, to come out and fight. Drake came out slowly against the wind and tide, and, after an hour's battle, the battered Drake struck her colors, with eight sailors being killed in action during the engagement. Having made temporary repairs, and with a prize crew on Drake, Ranger continued around the west coast of Ireland, capturing a lone storeship, and arrived at Brest with her prizes on 8 May. Captain Jones was detached to command , leaving Lieutenant Simpson, his first officer, in command. Ranger departed Brest 21 August, reaching Portsmouth, New Hampshire on 15 October, in company with and , plus three prizes taken in the Atlantic. The sloop departed Portsmouth on 24 February 1779 joining with the Continental Navy ships and in preying on British shipping in the North Atlantic. Seven prizes were captured early in April, and brought safely into port for sale. On 18 June, Ranger was underway again with Providence and Queen of France, capturing two Jamaicamen in July and nine more vessels off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Of the 11 prizes, three were recaptured, but the remaining eight, with their cargoes, were worth over a million dollars when sold in Boston. Underway on 23 November, Ranger was ordered to Commodore Whipple's squadron, arriving at Charleston on 23 December, to support the garrison there under siege by the British. On 24 January 1780, Ranger and Providence, in a short cruise down the coast, captured three transports, loaded with supplies, near Tybee, Georgia. The British army tasked with capturing Charleston was also discovered in the area. Ranger and Providence sailed back to Charleston with the news. Shortly afterwards the British commenced the final push. Although the channel and harbor configuration made naval operations and support difficult, Ranger took a station in the Cooper River, and was captured when Charleston fell on 11 May 1780. ===Royal Navy=== Ranger was taken into the British Royal Navy and commissioned under the name HMS Halifax. She was decommissioned in Portsmouth, England, in 1781, then sold as a merchant vessel for about 3 percent of her original cost. ==Specifications== Rangers specifications were: *Begun:January 11, 1777 *Launched:May 10, 1777 into the Piscataqua River *Location:Rising Castle, now Badger's Island, Kittery, Maine *Departed:Nov 1, 1777 *Builder:John Langdon *Designer:James Hackett *Yard Boss:Tobias Lear IV (father of Tobias Lear V, Secretary to President George Washington) *Officers: **John Paul Jones, Captain **Thomas Simpson, Portsmouth, 1st Lt. **Elijah Hall, Portsmouth, 2nd Lt. **Samuel Wallingford, Lt of Marines **Dr Ezrah Green, Dover, Surgeon **Mr Joseph Frazer, Sr Officer of Marines **Capt Matthew Parke *Crew:145 men including nearly half from Piscataqua area *Cost:$65,000 Continental dollars *Rating:Sloop of war *Rigging:Square rigged on all three masts with royals, topgallant, and a full set of studding sails *Arms:18 nine- pounder guns *Painting:Topside black with broad yellow stripe and masthead *Dimensions:(Recorded by Royal Navy after capture) **97' 2\\" at gundeck (est 110' overall) **77' 9\\" keel **27' 8\\" beam **12' depth of hold ==References== * ==External links== * . * John Paul Jones and the Ranger by J.

In her teens she got a break when she met one of the female music-hall performers who heard her sing and introduced her to show business promoters. She began performing under the stage name Pervenche, and soon met and married Robert Hollard, a performer who used the nom de guerre \\"Roberty\\". Alcohol entered her life at an early age and her drinking became a problem for her husband. Their marriage did not last long and her husband left her for another Parisian singer, Damia. Fr√©hel then began a relationship with Maurice Chevalier but that too did not last long and after he left her for the much older megastar Mistinguett. At 19 years old, she attempted suicide. Following her suicide attempt, in 1911 Marguerite Boulc'h tried to escape her pain and travelled to Bucharest, Turkey and then to Russia where she remained for more than ten years. She engaged regularly in alcohol and drugs, and she returned to Paris in 1923. She then signalled a new beginning by switching to the stage name \\"Fr√©hel\\", taking the name from Cap Fr√©hel in Brittany where her parents had been born. Singing as Fr√©hel, at the Paris Olympia in 1924 she gave a powerful performance and was soon headlining at the most popular venues in the country. Part of what is now referred to as the bal musette, Fr√©hel often sang accompanied by pipes and/or an accordion player. In the 1930s, she appeared in several motion pictures, almost always portraying a singer in a minor or supporting role. The most notable films in which she performed were 1931's C≈ìur de Lilas, based on the Tristan Bernard play, and P√©p√© le Moko that starred Jean Gabin. While her alcohol abuse continued, she nevertheless was a major show business force of 1930s France. Of all her songs, her 1939 La Java Bleue, with music by Vincent Scotto, proved her most popular. Despite being one of Europe's most sought-after performers, her addictions led her to drop out of public view for years. She never formed a permanent relationship, and she died in 1951, alone in a hotel in Pigalle. She was interred in the Cimeti√®re de Pantin, near Paris. Her 1934 recording Si tu n'√©tais pas l√† was featured in the 2001 soundtrack of the film Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am√©lie Poulain (Am√©lie). She is portrayed by Yolande Moreau in the Gainsbourg bio pic - in which she encounters the young Serge Gainsbourg and accompanies him in a song. ==Songs== *Comme un moineau (1925) *O√π est-il donc?

He was born in Kharkiv, in the Kharkov Governorate of the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine) and died in New York City. ==Life and career== The unprecedented migration of European knowledge and culture that swept from East to West during the first decades of the 20th Century included figures such as Prokofiev and Rachmaninov, great composers who were the product of the renowned Russian system of music education. Schillinger came from this background, dedicated to creating truly professional musicians, having been a student of the St Petersburg Imperial Conservatory of Music. Unlike his more famous contemporaries, Schillinger was a natural teacher and communicated his musical knowledge in the form of a precise written theory, using mathematical expressions to describe art, architecture, design and (most insistently, and with most detail and success) music. In New York, Schillinger flourished, becoming famous as the advisor to many of America's leading popular musicians and concert music composers including George Gershwin, Earle Brown, Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Oscar Levant, Tommy Dorsey and Henry Cowell. George Gershwin spent four years (1932‚Äì1936) studying with Schillinger. During this period, he composed Porgy and Bess and consulted Schillinger on matters concerning the opera, particularly its orchestration. There has been some disagreement about the nature of Schillinger's influence on Gershwin. After the posthumous success of Porgy and Bess, Schillinger claimed he had a large and direct influence in overseeing the creation of the opera; George's brother Ira Gershwin completely denied that his brother had any such assistance for this work. A third account of Gershwin's musical relationship with his teacher was written by Gershwin's close friend Vernon Duke, also a Schillinger student, in an article for The Musical Quarterly in 1947. Some of Gershwin's notebooks from his studies with Joseph Schillinger can be found at the Library of Congress. In the field of electronic music, Schillinger collaborated with L√©on Theremin, the inventor of an early electronic musical instrument, the Theremin. Schillinger wrote his First Airphonic Suite for L√©on Theremin, who played the instrument at the premiere in 1929 with the Cleveland Orchestra, conducted by Nikolai Sokoloff. Chart by Joseph Schillinger graphing Johann Sebastian Bach's Invention no. 8 in F Major, BWV 779 His mathematical principles were applied to various fields other than music. For example, Schillinger collaborated with the film maker Mary Ellen Bute and he also published a new method of dance notation. In the USA Schillinger taught at a number of educational institutions but his greatest success was his postal tuition courses, which later became The Schillinger System of Musical Composition, published posthumously in a 2 volume set compiled by Lyle Dowling and Arnold Shaw. Schillinger accredited a small group of students as qualified teachers of the System and after his death, one of them, Lawrence Berk, founded a music school in Boston to continue the dissemination of the System. Schillinger House opened in 1945 and later became the Berklee College of Music where the System survived in the curriculum until the early 1970s. There has been debate surrounding how many teachers were certified by Schillinger himself. The numbers cited range from seven to twelve certified teachers. Yet, to date, only seven certified teachers of the Schillinger System have been substantiated. Three certified teachers were Asher Zlotnik of Baltimore, Maryland, a student and personal friend of Lyle Dowling, Edwin Gerschefski,Goss, Glenda Dawn, Jean Sibelius: A Guide to Research, Routledge (Routledge Music Bibliographies), 1997. .

He started out as an art rock performer but subsequently started writing more pop- oriented material. He has had several top 40 hits in the UK and two in the US, but he is more popular in other countries, particularly Norway and Brazil. His 1986 love song \\"The Lady in Red\\" reached number one in several countries. De Burgh has sold over 45 million albums worldwide. ==Early life== De Burgh was born in Venado Tuerto, Argentina, to Colonel Charles John Davison, MBE,Burke's Irish Family Records, 1976, p. 342 a British diplomat, and Maeve Emily (n√©e de Burgh), an Irish secretary. His maternal grandfather was Sir Eric de Burgh, a British Army officer who had been Chief of the General Staff in India during the Second World War.Bargy Castle, Co. Wexford , Travelmania Ireland He took his mother's maiden name, \\"de Burgh\\", when he began performing. His father had substantial farming interests, and Chris spent much of his early years in Malta, Nigeria and Zaire, as he, his mother and brother accompanied Colonel Davison on his diplomatic and engineering work. The Davisons finally settled in Bargy Castle, County Wexford, Ireland, which was somewhat dilapidated at the time. It was a twelfth-century castle which Eric de Burgh bought in the 1960s. He converted it into a hotel, and the young Chris sang for the guests there. After attending Marlborough College in Wiltshire, England, de Burgh went on to graduate from Trinity College Dublin, with a Master of Arts degree in French, English and History. ==Musical career== Chris de Burgh signed his first contract with A&M; Records in 1974, and supported Supertramp on their Crime of the Century tour, building himself a small fan base. His d√©but album, Far Beyond These Castle Walls, was a folk-tinged stab at fantasy in the tradition of the Moody Blues. It failed to chart upon its release in late 1974. A few months later, he released a single called \\"Turning Round\\" from the album, released outside the UK and Ireland as \\"Flying\\". It failed to make an impression in the UK, but it stayed on top of the Brazilian charts for 17 weeks. This became a familiar pattern for the singer/songwriter, as every one of his 1970s albums failed to chart in the UK or US while they racked up big sales in continental European and South American countries. In 1975 his second album, Spanish Train and Other Stories, was released. Whilst (again) not a huge commercial success, the album and tour expanded the fan base, with de Burgh starting to attract a cult following. Along with the epic title track, other fan favourite tracks from the album included \\"Patricia The Stripper\\" and \\"A Spaceman Came Travelling\\" (the latter released the following year as a single). 1977's third album, At the End of a Perfect Day, whilst well received and featuring both former Fairport Convention drummer Dave Mattacks and later Fairport drummer Gerry Conway, failed to push de Burgh's career significantly, leading to the release of his fourth album Crusader in 1979. Crusader took a more electric direction, including guitar contributions from Ian Bairnson (formerly of Pilot), bass player David Paton (also of Pilot), and drummer Stuart Elliott (formerly of both Cockney Rebel and of Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel), all of whom were also working, at the time, with Kate Bush. The album also featured Sky keyboard player Francis Monkman and Mike Moran. Whilst it attracted a significant number of new fans, Crusader still failed to break through in the UK and US. 1980's Eastern Wind also failed to build further on the (still cult) following in the major territories. In 1981 de Burgh had his first UK chart entry with Best Moves, a collection culled from his early albums. It set the stage for 1982's Rupert Hine produced The Getaway, which reached number 30 in the UK charts and number 43 in the US, thanks to the eerie single \\"Don't Pay the Ferryman\\". Chris de Burgh's follow-up album, Man on the Line, also performed well, charting at 69 in the US and 11 in the UK. Chris de Burgh had an across-the-board success with the ballad \\"The Lady in Red\\" in late 1986; the single became a number one hit in the UK (number three in America) and its accompanying album, Into the Light, reached number two in the UK (number 25 in the U.S.). That Christmas season, a re-release of de Burgh's 1976 Christmas song \\"A Spaceman Came Travelling\\" became a Top 40 hit in the UK. Flying Colours, his follow-up to Into the Light, entered the British charts at number one upon its 1988 release, yet it failed to make the American charts. De Burgh has not had another hit in the US and his commercial fortunes began to slide in Britain in the early 1990s, yet he retained a following around the world. This is mainly due to inactivity of his previous recording label A&M; Records UK division in the U.S. In 1997 de Burgh composed a song entitled \\"There's a New Star Up in Heaven Tonight\\", dedicated to Diana, Princess of Wales. The song was released as a 100-copy limited edition and included on the compilations The Ultimate Collection (2000) and Now and Then (2009). In 2007 a concert in Tehran was planned for mid-2008, together with local band Arian, which would have made Chris de Burgh the first western pop singer to perform in Iran since the 1979 revolution. However, the concert never went ahead because he had not been given permission by the Iranian authorities to perform in the country. He was the first Western act to play in Lebanon after the Lebanese Civil War. On 25 June 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Chris de Burgh among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. ==Personal life== Chris de Burgh has been married to his wife Diane since 1977 and lives in Enniskerry, County Wicklow, in Ireland, having moved there from Dalkey, Dublin, in 1997. They have two sons, Hubie and Michael, and a daughter, Rosanna, best known as the winner of the Miss World competition in 2003 for Ireland. His second cousin,Burke's Irish Family Records, 1976, pp.342‚Äì3. Danny Kinahan of Castle Upton, served as Member of Parliament for South Antrim between 2015 and 2017. In 1994 he was found to have had an affair with his children's 19-year-old Irish nanny, Maresa Morgan, who was assisting the family while de Burgh's wife Diane was recuperating in the hospital from a broken neck suffered during a horse-riding accident. De Burgh later said he felt very guilty about the affair and subsequently reconciled with his wife. In 2011 bottles from de Burgh's vintage wine cellar sold for over $500,000, including a world record set for a magnum collection of postwar vintages. De Burgh has a noted interest in war history, especially that of the First and Second World Wars. His songs contain numerous references to soldiers and battle, and in 2006 he purchased a rare First World War letter written by an unknown soldier. De Burgh has said that he is \\"certainly a believer in Christ\\" but he has always had a deep distrust of organized religion. De Burgh believes in the power of spiritual healing as an alternative therapy to reduce pain. He claims that he has been able to heal people with his own hands and that he gained an \\"all-encompassing strength\\" that was contacted through prayer. ==Media profile== During the 1970s de Burgh received mainly positive feedback from the music press, as he attempted to build his career. However, since the release of \\"The Lady in Red\\", in 1986, both the music and news media have become significantly more negative towards him, both personally and professionally. De Burgh has pursued and won 16 defamation actions. The Irish Independent said he has always been a bit prickly about criticism. Peter Crawley, a theatre reviewer at The Irish Times, received a directed response from de Burgh when he wrote a less than sympathetic review of de Burgh's show in Dublin's Gaiety Theatre in September 2009. Crawley wrote: \\"He departs the stage for 'Lady in Red', invading boxes and draping himself over audience members ... Certain toes will never uncurl after this experience, but it is almost admirable how unaltered de Burgh has remained by the flow of time.\\" In a lengthy, much-publicised reply to the critic, de Burgh made his feelings known, particularly in the postscript: AllMusic critic Greg Prato has stated: \\"Depending on who you ask, Chris de Burgh either specializes in pretentious, bombastic art rock disguised as pop or is a master of penning soaring and majestic compositions.\\" The BBC has said of de Burgh: \\"To his millions of fans, Chris de Burgh is the ultimate romantic singer. But to many others he's a figure of fun.\\" When the staff of Melody Maker were putting together a lampoon edition of a new arts and music magazine, they chose de Burgh for the cover. His signature song, \\"The Lady in Red\\", has been repeatedly voted one of the public's most disliked songs. In 2006, Neil Norman, writing for The Independent, described de Burgh as \\"the world's naffest balladeer\\". In his favour, Mike DeGagne, writing for AllMusic, has acclaimed de Burgh as \\"a genuine master of the soft ballad\\" and \\"one of the finest mood-invoking artists ever\\". ==DiscographyStudio albums=== *Far Beyond These Castle Walls (1974) *Spanish Train and Other Stories (1975) *At the End of a Perfect Day (1977) *Crusader (1979) *Eastern Wind (1980) *The Getaway (1982) *Man on the Line (1984) *Into the Light (1986) *Flying Colours (1988) *Power of Ten (1992) *This Way Up (1994) *Quiet Revolution (1999) *Timing Is Everything (2002) *The Road to Freedom (2004) *The Storyman (2006) *Footsteps (2008) *Moonfleet & Other Stories (2010) *Footsteps 2 (2011) *Home (2012) *The Hands of Man (2014) *A Better World (2016) ==Filmography== *How to Cheat in the Leaving Certificate (1998) (as Petrol Pumper) ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Official record store and merchandise site * * *Audio interview at BBC Wiltshire *Interview with Akira The Don Category:1948 births Category:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin Category:A&M; Records artists Category:Argentine people of British descent Category:Argentine people of Irish descent Category:Art rock musicians Category:British expatriates in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:British expatriates in Malta Category:British expatriates in Nigeria Category:British male singers Category:British pop singers Category:British singer-songwriters Category:British soft rock musicians Category:British songwriters Category:Irish male singers Category:Irish people of English descent Category:Irish pop singers Category:Irish singer-songwriters Category:Irish songwriters Category:Living people Category:People educated at Marlborough College Category:People from General L√≥pez Department ","title":"Chris de Burgh"},{"id":"823788","text":"Serlio's canon of the 5 orders of architecture. Sebastiano Serlio (6 September 1475 - c. 1554) was an Italian Mannerist architect, who was part of the Italian team building the Palace of Fontainebleau. Serlio helped canonize the classical orders of architecture in his influential treatise variously known as I sette libri dell'architettura (\\"Seven Books of Architecture\\") or Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva (\\"All the works on architecture and perspective\\"). ==Biography== Born in Bologna, Serlio went to Rome in 1514, and worked in the atelier of Baldassare Peruzzi, where he stayed until the Sack of Rome in 1527 put all architectural projects on hold for a time. Like Peruzzi, he began as a painter. He lived in Venice from about 1527 to the early 1540s but left little mark on the city. Serlio's model of church fa√ßade of 1537 crystallized a format that lasted into the 18th century. Serlio's model of church fa√ßade was a regularized version, cleaned up and made more classical, of the innovative method of providing a facade to a church with a high vaulted nave flanked by low side aisles, providing a classical face to a Gothic form, that was first seen in Alberti's Santa Maria Novella in Florence (c. 1458). The idea was in the air in the 1530s: several contemporary churches compete for primacy, but Serlio's woodcut put the concept in every architect's hands. As a civil engineer he designed fortifications. Serlio's publications, rather than any spectacular executed work, attracted the attention of Fran√ßois I. Serlio's career took off when the king invited him to France, to advise on the construction and decoration of the Ch√¢teau of Fontainebleau, where a team of Italian designers and craftsmen were assembled (including such luminaries as Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola and Benvenuto Cellini). Serlio took several private commissions, but the only one that has survived in any recognizable way is the Chateau of Ancy-le-Franc, built about 1546 near Tonnerre in Burgundy. Serlio died around 1554 in Fontainebleau, after spending his last years in Lyon. ==Treatise on architecture== A page from the seventh book Two pages from the eighth book Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva (All the Works of Architecture and Perspective) is Serlio's practical treatise on architecture. Although Leon Battista Alberti produced the first book-length architectural treatise of the Renaissance (c. 1450, published in 1486),Alberti 1988, p.xvi,xviii it was unillustrated, written in Latin, and designed to appeal as much to learned humanists and potential patrons as to architects and builders. Serlio pioneered the use of high quality illustrations to supplement the text. He wrote in Italian, some of his books being published with parallel texts in Italian and French. His treatise catered explicitly to the needs of architects, builders, and craftsmen. The treatise is composed of eight books, the sixth of which was lost for some centuries and the eighth of which was not published until relatively recently. The eighth book is not always considered to be part of the treatise. The first five books cover Serlio's works on geometry, perspective, Roman antiquity, the orders and church design. The sixth illustrates domestic designs ranging from peasant huts to royal palaces, providing a unique record of Renaissance house types, including up-to-date fortresses for tyrants and mercenaries as well as Serlio's unbuilt design for the Louvre. The seventh book illustrates a range of common design problems ignored by past theorists, including how to remodel, or 'restore', Gothic fa√ßades following antique principles of symmetry and proportion. The eighth book, called \\"Castrametation of the Romans\\", reconstructs a Roman encampment after the description by Polybius, followed by a military city and monumental bridge supposedly built by the Emperor Trajan. With its forum, consul's palace and baths, the book is part-fantasy and part-archaeology, quite unlike Serlio's other more practical works. In the introduction to Book IV, Serlio credits his recently deceased mentor for much of its content: \\"As for all the pleasant things which you will find in this book, you should give the credit not to me but to my teacher, Baldassare Peruzzi from Siena...\\"Hart & Hicks 1996, p. 253. The extent of Peruzzi's contribution to the treatise is unknown. \\"Peruzzi had been the guiding spirit in the detailed study of the remains of antiquity, and he had left his drawings to Serlio. Vasari and Cellini would give most of the credit for the book to Peruzzi, but more recent writers defend Serlio's part in the study and his good faith in completing the work of his companion.\\"Allardyce Nicoll: \\"Sebastiano Serlio, 1475-1554\\" in Hewitt 1958, p. 19. ===Plan and publication=== { class=\\"infobox\\" -    4     1537 Venice On the Five Styles of Buildings -   3      1540 Venice On Antiquities - 12       1545 Paris On Geometry, On Perspective -     5    1547 Paris On Temples -        X 1551 Lyon Extraordinary Book of DoorsBecause Serlio projected a 7-book treatise, and book 6 remained in manuscript, this book has been logically but incorrectly labelled \\"Book VI\\" in some editions. -       7  1575 FrankfurtOn Situations (posthumous) -      6   1966 Milan On Habitations (posth; MS facs) -         Y1994 Milan On Polybius' Castrametation -  colspan=11  Publication order of the books, compared with Serlio's numerical order.Hart & Hicks 1996, p. xxv } By 1537, when the earliest of his books was published, Serlio had been working on the treatise for at least a decade and had already organized it as a work in seven books. Although Serlio completed all seven projected books, only the first five books were published during his lifetime. The sixth remained in manuscript until the 20th century.One manuscript of Book VI is in the Avery Architectural Library, Columbia University. A second manuscript of Book VI as well as a manuscript of \\"On Polybius' Castrametation\\" (sometimes referred to as \\"Book VIII\\") are in the Staatsbibliothek, Munich. He composed two additional books, which can be thought of as appendices: the Extraordinary Book of Doors, the last book he saw through the press; and On Polybius' Castrametation, a discussion of ancient Roman military camp design, whose state of completion and intended relation to the other books are both uncertain. It is not certain what title, if any, Serlio intended for the work as a whole‚Äîpossibly General Rules of Architecture, as is given on the first-published book, but this soon became attached specifically to that book.Hart & Hicks 1996, p. xxxix Various collections were known as the Five or Seven Books on Architecture, depending on their content. Often it is referred to simply as Serlio's Architettura, and several significant editions take the title Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva (\\"All the works on architecture and perspective\\"); though the first time that all nine existing books (or even all seven numbered books) were in fact published in a single edition was in the 2-volume English translation of 1996‚Äì2001.Hart & Hicks 2001, p. liv ===Content=== Although the books apparently appeared more or less in Serlio's desired publication order, his nominal order provides a distinct flow from general to specific: > Serlio's reader moves from: first, the Euclidean 'heaven' composed of the > definitions of geometry comprising point, line and perfect (square) planes; > second, the underlying, three-dimensional forms of Nature represented > through the theory of perspective; third, the architectural embodiment of > perfect form reflected in the Pantheon and the 'idealised' monuments of > antiquity; fourth, the rules of the Orders, progressing from Tuscan to > Composite, as evidenced in antique ruins and the text of Vitruvius, and the > universality of the Orders in composing doors, fireplaces and palace > fa√ßades; fifth, the use of the Orders in temples of Serlio's invention; > sixth, the use of the Orders in house designs (again graded, ascending from > hut to palace); concluding at the lowest, seventh stage with 'accidents' or > practical problems which the architect might encounter.Hart & Hicks 1996, p. > xxvi Significantly, the last few pages of the second book, \\"On Perspective\\", contain three theatrical scenes (comic, tragic, and satiric) and a stage plan and cross section which were highly influential in Renaissance theater. In Aesthetics point of view Serlio is one of the first that use the expression fine arts: \\"and lately Leo X father and patron of all fine arts and all good artists\\".Regole generali della architettura,book IV: \\"et ultimamente Leone X padre, et protettore di tutte le belle arti, et di tutti i buoni operatori\\" ===Influence=== Serlio's volumes were highly influential in France, the Netherlands, and England, as a conveyor of the Italian Renaissance style, and quickly became available in a variety of languages. His plans and elevations of many Roman buildings provided useful repertory of classical images, often reprinted. Within five years of its original publication, the Flemish scholar Pieter Coecke van Aelst published, in Antwerp, adaptations of Book IV in Flemish, German, and French; Serlio considered these unauthorized versions of his work to be inferior forgeries; nevertheless they served as significant vectors in the spread of his influence.Hart & Hicks 1996, p. xxxii-xxxiii, 470. Coecke van Aelst's pupil the Dutch architect and engineer Hans Vredeman de Vries propagated Serlio's style and ornaments north of the Alps. And a Dutch version of Books I-V -- published in Amsterdam in 1606 and based largely on Coecke van Aelst's work in Flemish‚Äîserved as the basis for the English translation of Books I-V published by Robert Peake in London in 1611. Fourth- hand though it was, it remained the most complete English edition of Serlio for almost four centuries. Its example countered the influence of the engravings of Antwerp Mannerism that were the main inspiration for Jacobean architecture. Later Serlio's book was in the libraries of Sir Christopher Wren and John Wood, the Elder the architect and entrepreneur who laid out Bath. Inigo Jones possessed Italian editions, which he annotated.Hart & Hicks 1996, p. xxxiv. Books III & IV were published in Spanish in 1552 in Toledo by Juan de Ayala with the same illustrations as the original Italian editions.

He graduated from Mount Zion Academy and from South Carolina College at Columbia in 1820. He moved to Autauga County, Alabama, the same year, where he studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1823. That same year he constructed a house (\\"Old Homestead\\") in the town of Lowndesboro, Alabama, twenty miles west of the state capitol in Montgomery. He began to practice law in Montgomery and was elected a member of the Alabama House of Representatives in 1826, serving until 1828. He was elected as a States Rights Democrat to the twenty-first and to the seven succeeding Congresses and served from March 4, 1829, to April 22, 1844, when he resigned the House to join the Senate. He served as chairman of the United States House Committee on Indian Affairs from 1831 to 1835. He was nearly elected Speaker of the House in the 26th Congress, receiving 113 votes on the 8th ballot, just four votes short of the necessary 117 needed to be elected. Robert M. T. Hunter was elected on the 11th ballot.The Life of Representative Dixon Hall Lewis of Alabama. Office of the Historian Dixon H.

In the Senate he served as chairman of the Finance Committee from 1845 to 1847. A strikingly obese figure, Lewis was known to weigh as much as 500 pounds (227 kg), making him the heaviest member of Congress ever. A specially-constructed seat was provided in the Senate chambers for him, and his carriage was fitted with unusually heavy suspension springs. According to the WPA Federal Writers' Project publication Alabama: A Guide to the Deep South, a popular witticism among Lewis's colleagues was the observation that Alabama had the largest representation of any state.

Walker Books) Cover by Anthony Accardohttp://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?225149 Norby The Mixed-Up Robot (1983, Walker & Company) is the first book in the Norby series by Janet Asimov and Isaac Asimov. In it, Jefferson Wells and Norby stop Ing from taking over the Solar System with the help of Jeff's brother Fargo Wells, police officer Albany Jones, and Admiral Boris Yobo. According to Isaac Asimov, although Janet Asimov did 90% of the work, his \\"name was wanted on the book for the betterment of sales [and he] went over the manuscript and polished it a bit.\\"I. Asimov: A Memoir. Isaac Asimov. Bantam Books. 1995. pp. 367. It, along with its sequel, was illustrated for Boys' Life. ==Plot summary== The book starts with Jeff Wells, a cadet at a military academy on Mars in need of a teaching robot, for although he is not flunking, his substandard grades have caused concern for Commander Widlow, who has also pointed out that the Wells family has lost their fortune and his tuition is overdue, ergo termination is recommended. The more sympathetic commandant, Admiral Yobo, permits Jeff to remain in the academy being well aware of the hardships of the Wellses, and gives Jeff a cashier's check to buy a robot. As the academy has ended for summer, Jeff returns to Earth, where he buys a small, fat robot only to discover that it has the only mini-anti-gravity device in existence. The robot reveals he is named Norby, and was owned many years ago by a man named MacGillicuddy who found him in a wrecked spaceship, then used his parts to repair a damaged robot of his own, hence his comical shape. Norby and Jeff go to the park where the evil villain Ing's henchmen are after Fargo Wells, Jeff's brother. Norby and Jeff stop the henchmen who are captured by the police. The policewoman in charge of the squad identifies herself as Albany Jones, whom Fargo knew from his days at Neil Armstrong High School. Ing manages to take over Manhattan Island, renaming it the \\"Kingdom of Ing\\", but Norby and Jeff start a revolt against him with the aid of a dowdy woman whom they save from being arrested. However, as Ing's soldiers are about to capture Jeff, Norby absconds using a hyperdrive, never before done and creating a subplot for the second book in the series Norby's Other Secret, as they end up in a jungle planet named Jamya. Norby uses the hyperdrive to return to Earth, where they enlist Admiral Yobo in their quest to stop Ing. The trio takes Admiral Yobo's ship, but Norby warns that his hyperspace ability does not guarantee a successful infiltration of the Kingdom of Ing, to which Jeff sternly orders Norby to push forward. The hyperdrive literally causes Yobo's ship to hover above Ing's head, forcing him to a humiliating surrender. After unmasking Ing, he is revealed to be Commander Widlow, who held a longtime grudge against Jeff and Fargo's family. The book ends with Fargo restoring the family fortune, and Albany Jones earning a promotion, as well as starting a relationship with Fargo. Jeff ends the story saying Norby is his Mixed-Up Robot. ==Audio version== A vinyl LP recording of Chapters 1 and 2 of Norby The Mixed-Up Robot was released in 1986 by Caedmon Records https://www.discogs.com/Mark-Hamill-Norby-The-Mixed-Up-Robot/release/11094725.

External jugular vein marked by an arrow; however, JVP is not measured by looking at the external jugular vein even but is instead measured by pulsations of the skin from the internal jugular vein, which is not visible in this image. The jugular venous pressure (JVP, sometimes referred to as jugular venous pulse) is the indirectly observed pressure over the venous system via visualization of the internal jugular vein. It can be useful in the differentiation of different forms of heart and lung disease. Classically three upward deflections and two downward deflections have been described. * The upward deflections are the \\"a\\" (atrial contraction), \\"c\\" (ventricular contraction and resulting bulging of tricuspid into the right atrium during isovolumetric systole) and \\"v\\" = venous filling * The downward deflections of the wave are the \\"x\\" descent (the atrium relaxes and the tricuspid valve moves downward) and the \\"y\\" descent (filling of ventricle after tricuspid opening). ==MethodVisualization=== The veins of the neck, viewed from in front. The patient is positioned at a 45¬∞ incline, and the filling level of the external jugular vein determined. The internal jugular vein is visualised when looking for the pulsation. In healthy people, the filling level of the jugular vein should be less than 4 centimetres vertical height above the sternal angle. A pen-light can aid in discerning the jugular filling level by providing tangential light. The JVP is easiest to observe if one looks along the surface of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, as it is easier to appreciate the movement relative to the neck when looking from the side (as opposed to looking at the surface at a 90 degree angle). Like judging the movement of an automobile from a distance, it is easier for an observer to see the movement of an automobile when it is crossing the observer's path at 90 degrees (i.e., moving left to right or right to left), as opposed to coming towards the observer. Pulses in the JVP are rather hard to observe, but trained cardiologists do try to discern these as signs of the state of the right atrium. ===Differentiation from the carotid pulse=== The JVP and carotid pulse can be differentiated several ways: *multiphasic ‚Äì the JVP \\"beats\\" twice (in quick succession) in the cardiac cycle. In other words, there are two waves in the JVP for each contraction-relaxation cycle by the heart. The first beat represents that atrial contraction (termed a) and second beat represents venous filling of the right atrium against a closed tricuspid valve (termed v) and not the commonly mistaken 'ventricular contraction'. These wave forms may be altered by certain medical conditions; therefore, this is not always an accurate way to differentiate the JVP from the carotid pulse. The carotid artery only has one beat in the cardiac cycle. *non-palpable ‚Äì the JVP cannot be palpated. If one feels a pulse in the neck, it is generally the common carotid artery. *occludable ‚Äì the JVP can be stopped by occluding the internal jugular vein by lightly pressing against the neck. It will fill from above. ===JVP waveform=== The jugular venous pressure waveform The jugular venous pulsation has a biphasic waveform. * The a wave corresponds to right atrial contraction and ends synchronously with the carotid artery pulse. The peak of the 'a' wave demarcates the end of atrial systole. *The x descent follows the 'a' wave and corresponds to atrial relaxation and rapid atrial filling due to low pressure. * The c wave corresponds to right ventricular contraction causing the tricuspid valve to bulge towards the right atrium during RV isovolumetric contraction. * The x descent follows the 'c' wave and occurs as a result of the right ventricle pulling the tricuspid valve downward during ventricular systole (ventricular ejection/atrial relaxation). (As stroke volume is ejected, the ventricle takes up less space in the pericardium, allowing relaxed atrium to enlarge). The x' (x prime) descent can be used as a measure of right ventricle contractility. * The v wave corresponds to venous filling when the tricuspid valve is closed and venous pressure increases from venous return ‚Äì this occurs during and following the carotid pulse. * The y descent corresponds to the rapid emptying of the atrium into the ventricle following the opening of the tricuspid valve. ===Quantification=== A classical method for quantifying the JVP was described by Borst & Molhuysen in 1952. It has since been modified in various ways. A venous arch may be used to measure the JVP more accurately. ===Moodley's sign=== This sign is used to determine which waveform you are viewing. Feel the radial pulse while simultaneously watching the JVP. The waveform that is seen immediately after the arterial pulsation is felt is the 'v wave' of the JVP. ===Abdominojugular test=== The term \\"hepatojugular reflux\\" was previously used as it was thought that compression of the liver resulted in \\"reflux\\" of blood out of the hepatic sinusoids into the inferior vena cava, thereby elevating right atrial pressure and visualized as jugular venous distention. The exact physiologic mechanism of jugular venous distention with a positive test is much more complex and the commonly accepted term is now \\"abdominojugular test\\". In a prospective randomized study involving 86 patients who underwent right and left cardiac catheterization, the abdominojugular test was shown to correlate best with the pulmonary arterial wedge pressure. Furthermore, patients with a positive response had lower left ventricular ejection fractions and stroke volumes, higher left ventricular filling pressure, higher mean pulmonary arterial, and higher right atrial pressures. The abdominojugular test, when done in a standardized fashion, correlates best with the pulmonary arterial wedge pressure, and therefore, is probably a reflection of an increased central blood volume. In the absence of isolated right ventricular failure, seen in some patients with right ventricular infarction, a positive abdominojugular test suggests a pulmonary artery wedge pressure of 15 mm Hg or greater. ==Interpretation== Certain wave form abnormalities, include cannon a-waves, or increased amplitude 'a' waves, are associated with AV dissociation (third degree heart block), when the atrium is contracting against a closed tricuspid valve, or even in ventricular tachycardia. Another abnormality, \\"c-v waves\\", can be a sign of tricuspid regurgitation. The absence of 'a' waves may be seen in atrial fibrillation. An elevated JVP is the classic sign of venous hypertension (e.g. right-sided heart failure). JVP elevation can be visualized as jugular venous distension, whereby the JVP is visualized at a level of the neck that is higher than normal. The paradoxical increase of the JVP with inspiration (instead of the expected decrease) is referred to as the Kussmaul sign, and indicates impaired filling of the right ventricle. The differential diagnosis of Kussmaul's sign includes constrictive pericarditis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, pericardial effusion, and severe right-sided heart failure. An exaggerated \\"y\\" wave or diastolic collapse of the neck veins from constrictive pericarditis is referred to as Friedreich's sign. * Raised JVP, normal waveform ** Bradycardia ** Fluid overload ** Heart failure * Raised JVP, absent pulsation ** Superior vena cava syndrome * Large 'a' wave (increased atrial contraction pressure) ** Tricuspid stenosis ** Right heart failure ** Pulmonary hypertension * Cannon 'a' wave (atria contracting against closed tricuspid valve) ** Atrial flutter ** Premature atrial rhythm (or tachycardia) ** Third degree heart block ** Ventricular ectopics ** Ventricular tachycardia * Absent 'a' wave (no unifocal atrial depolarisation) ** Atrial fibrillation * Large 'v' wave (c‚Äìv wave) ** Tricuspid regurgitation * Absent 'x' descent ** Tricuspid regurgitation (sometimes 'x' wave is replaced by a positive wave) * Prominent 'x' descent ** Cardiac tamponade * Slow 'y' descent ** Tricuspid stenosis ** Cardiac tamponade * Prominent & deep 'y' descent ** Constrictive pericarditis * Parodoxical JVP (Kussmaul's sign: JVP rises with inspiration, drops with expiration) ** Pericardial effusion ** Constrictive pericarditis ** Pericardial tamponade An important use of the jugular venous pressure is to assess the central venous pressure in the absence of invasive measurements (e.g. with a central venous catheter, which is a tube inserted in the neck veins). A 1996 systematic review concluded that a high jugular venous pressure makes a high central venous pressure more likely, but does not significantly help confirm a low central venous pressure. The study also found that agreement between doctors on the jugular venous pressure can be poor. == See also == * Wiggers diagram ==References== ==External links== * Clinical Examination page on JVP * JVP (GPnotebook) * Normal jugular vein waves ‚Äì Merck Manual Category:Cardiovascular physiology Category:Physical examination Category:Internal medicine Category:Interventional cardiology Category:Nephrology articles by importance ","title":"Jugular venous pressure"},{"id":"823838","text":"Professor Geoffrey Alan Parker FRS (born 24 May 1944) is an emeritus professor of biology at the University of Liverpool\\"Geoff Parker B.Sc., M.A. (Cantab), Ph.D., F.R.S.\\", University of Liverpool. and the 2008 recipient of the Darwin Medal. He has a particular interest in behavioural ecology and evolutionary biology, and is most noted for introducing the concept of sperm competition in 1970. Much of his work from the 1970s onwards has related to the application of game theory (theory of games) to various biological problems, using the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) approach pioneered by John Maynard Smith and George Price. With R. R. Baker and V. G. F. Smith in 1972, he proposed a leading theory for the evolution of anisogamy and two sexes, and in 1979 made the first theoretical analysis of sexual conflict in evolution. He has also investigated the evolution of competitive mate searching, animal distributions, animal fighting, coercion, intrafamilial conflict, complex life cycles, and several other topics. ==Life== Parker was educated at Lymm Grammar School in Lymm, Cheshire, and gained his BSc from University of Bristol in 1965, from where he also gained a doctorate in 1969 under H.E.

At this time, most ethologists and ecologists interpreted adaptations in terms of \\"survival value to the species\\"\\". However, the paradigm shift of the gene-centric view of evolution (popularised by Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene) shortly afterwards overturned this idea: mainstream views in behavioural ecology and sociobiology saw natural selection restored to Darwinian principles in terms of survival value to the individual (and its kin). Parker's work played a part in this shift and in the early development of behavioural ecology. He moved to the University of Liverpool in 1968, where he became a lecturer in zoology. In 1978, he was a senior research fellow in the Research Centre at King's College, Cambridge University, returning to Liverpool in 1979. He became a professor in 1989 on election to the Royal Society, In 1996, he became the Derby Chair of Zoology, retiring in 2009, but remaining as emeritus professor and continuing scientific research (as of 2014). In 2005, he won the Frink Medal, of the Zoological Society of London. In 2008, he won the Darwin Medal: He has been awarded the degrees of Doctor of Science, honoris causa by the University of Bristol. in 2011, and by the Memorial University of Newfoundland in 2018. ==See also== * Evolutionarily stable strategy * Resource holding potential * Sperm competition * Sexual conflict ==References== ==External links== * Category:English zoologists Category:Evolutionary biologists Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Fellows of King's College, Cambridge Category:Alumni of the University of Bristol Category:Academics of the University of Liverpool Category:20th-century British zoologists Category:People from Lymm ","title":"Geoff Parker"},{"id":"823840","text":"Nintendo Power is a video game news and strategy podcast from Nintendo of America, which had originated in August 1988 as Nintendo's official print magazine. The magazine's publication was initially done monthly by Nintendo of America, then independently, and in December 2007 contracted to Future US, the American subsidiary of British publisher Future. Its 24-year production run is one of the longest of all video game magazines in the United States and Canada. On August 21, 2012, Nintendo announced that it would not be renewing its licensing agreement with Future Publishing, and that Nintendo Power would cease publication in December. The final issue, volume 285, was released on December 11, 2012. On December 20, 2017, Nintendo Power officially returned as a podcast. ==History== Predating Nintendo Power is the Nintendo Fun Club News, a newsletter sent to club members for free. In mid-1988 it was discontinued after seven issues in favor of Nintendo Power. The new magazine was founded by Nintendo of America marketing manager Gail Tilden in 1988. The first issue, dated July/August 1988, spotlights the NES game Super Mario Bros. 2. Of this issue, 3.6 million copies were published, with every member of the Nintendo Fun Club receiving a free copy. From the beginning, Nintendo Power focuses heavily on providing game strategy, reviews, and previews of upcoming games. In mid-1998, Nintendo Power first allowed outside advertising in the magazine, formerly reserved for Nintendo-based products only. In its early years, ads only appeared in the first and last few pages of the magazine, leaving no ads to break up the magazine's editorial content. In July 2005, Nintendo Power introduced a new design to appeal to a limited gaming audience, including a new logo and article format. Along with the cosmetic overhaul came a greater focus on Nintendo fans, staff reviews, rumor-milling, and fan service including an expanded and enhanced reader mail segment (known as \\"Pulse\\") and a revamped \\"Community\\" section. Nintendo introduced a new incentive promotional offer that involved the registration of three Nintendo (or Nintendo affiliated) products through Nintendo.com to receive a free three issue trial subscription to Nintendo Power. Later, the magazine changed its focus from game strategies and cheat codes to mainly news, previews, and articles on upcoming games. On September 19, 2007, Nintendo officially announced that the large magazine publisher Future US would begin publishing Nintendo Power. The company's first official issue was released in October, as issue #222 (December 2007). It was also revealed that circulation would be increased to 13 issues a year, with the extra magazine being a holiday season bonus issue. Nintendo Power stopped making the Bonus issue in 2011. On August 21, 2012, Nintendo announced that it had opted not to renew the licensing agreement with Future Publishing and that Nintendo Power would cease publication after 24 years. The final issue would be December 2012. Senior Editor, Chris Hoffman stated that his staff would \\"try to make the last issues memorable\\". Nintendo reportedly did not actively participate in discussions to continue the magazine online. Nintendo Power officially returned on December 20, 2017 as a podcast, using the original logo design. ==Format== The final issue of Nintendo Power, paying homage to the first issue's cover picture The magazine was edited at first by Fun Club \\"President\\" Howard Phillips, himself an avid gamer. While the Fun Club News focused solely on games made in-house by Nintendo, Nintendo Power was created to allow for reviews of games produced by those licensed by Nintendo, such as Konami, Capcom, and the like. Nintendo Powers mascot in the late 1980s and early 1990s was Nester, a comic character created by Phillips. After Phillips left the company, Nester became the magazine's sole mascot. Early issues of the magazine featured a two-page Howard and Nester comic, which was later replaced with the two-page Nester's Adventures, later reduced to one page, and eventually dropped altogether. Subsequently, Mario replaced Nester as the mascot of the magazine. Later, during the early 2000s, the magazine made another mascot out of its Senior Writer, Alan Averill. Apparently very camera-shy, Averill himself never appeared in any photos; rather, he was represented by a plush toy of a Blue Slime from Dragon Quest. Fans often clamored to see what Averill actually looked like, but the magazine continued to substitute with photos of the toy, and even claimed that Alan was, in fact, a Blue Slime. Eventually, Averill retired from Nintendo Power, joining Nintendo of America's localization department. To this day, most fans have never seen a real image of Averill. The inclusion of a photo of Mr. T in the Player's Pulse section became a running gag in the early half of 2005. Late in the magazine's life, running gags centered on Chuck Norris references and jokes at the expense of writer Chris Shepperd. During the early 1990s, the magazine used what was a unique and very expensive promotion: giving away a free copy of the new NES game Dragon Quest to every new subscriber. This promotion was in part a move on Nintendo's part to make money off Dragon Warrior (Dragon Quest in Japan) which had not sold nearly as well as Nintendo had anticipated, and it was left with a large number of unsold cartridges on its hands. The promotion both helped the company get rid of the unsold merchandise, and won the magazine thousands of new subscribers. Following the release of the Super NES, the magazine featured lengthy, continuous comic stories based on Super Mario World and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. After these stories ended, they were replaced by similar multi-issue stories based on Star Fox, Super Metroid, and later on, Nintendo 64 games such as Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire and Blast Corps. Comics based on the animated series of Pok√©mon and Kirby: Right Back At Ya! also made several appearances. Toward the end, short excerpts based on Custom Robo and Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes are featured, as well as a very short Metroid Prime comic, and one based on the Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon games translated from the original Japanese version. ==Official Guides from Nintendo Power== Nintendo Power produced a series of strategy magazines called Official Guides from Nintendo Power. The first one is simply called The Official Nintendo Player's Guide. Since Nintendo Power switched from a bi- monthly magazine to a monthly magazine in May 1990, every other issue is a strategy guide focused on a single game. Only four such strategy guides were released. Nintendo then outsourced production of official guides to Prima Games. ==Spin-off magazines== During 2001, Nintendo Power released a spin-off semi-magazine named Nintendo Power Advance, featuring the Game Boy Advance and its games. A copy of the first issue was given complimentary to subscribers in addition to being sold at newsstands. Four issues of Nintendo Power Advance were printed, the last of which serves as a strategy guide for Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2. With the release of Pok√©mon for the Game Boy in 1998, Nintendo Power included six mini-issues of Pok√©mon Power mainly featuring tips and strategies for the game. In 1989, a smaller version of the magazine called Pocket Power was distributed at movie theaters showing The Wizard. ==Nester== Nester Nester is the long-time teenage mascot and comic strip star of Nintendo Power. Nester was created by Howard Phillips, \\"President\\" of the Nintendo Fun Club and a former editor of Nintendo Power, to be the supporting character in his comic strip, Howard & Nester. The comic strips generally advertised new games, often by dream sequences where Nester was actually a given video game character. From 1989 to 1993, The Nintendo Power Awards featured Nester-shaped trophies and were referred to in the magazine as the \\"Nesters\\" as a reference to the Oscars. In the June 1991 issue (Volume 25), Phillips was written out of the strip after his real-life counterpart left Nintendo to work for LucasArts. The strip was retitled Nester's Adventures the following issue and continued publication until Volume 55 (December 1993). Nester, now as a college student, appeared in Nintendo Power issue #100. He is seen again in issue #231, the magazine's twentieth anniversary, here a grown man with a son new to Nintendo. Nester's final appearance in Nintendo Power is in the final issue, Volume 285, in a comic titled \\"Nester & Max\\", where he is seen reading and lamenting the final issue. He is then reminded by his son that, \\"None of this is really going away, is it? I mean, Nintendo Power had a great run and you've got it all right here. It's like when you finish a great game - you're kind of sad to see it end, but really proud and happy, too. You know what I see when I look at this final issue? 100% completion.\\" Nester had also been featured in a few video games that were released while the character was still featured in the magazine. His first appearance was as a commentator in NES Play Action Football. Other appearances include the ending of To the Earth. Nester was the main character in Nester's Funky Bowling for the Virtual Boy, which also introduced his sister Hester. The character of Lark in Pilotwings 64 for the Nintendo 64 was based on Nester.Nintendo Power: \\"His handle is Lark, but everyone in class knows this guy is Nester.\\" Nintendo Power. Nintendo of America. September 1996, page 25. Several games for the NES featured the name \\"NESTER\\" as one of the pre-set names on high-score lists, or a default character name such as in To the Earth. The original NES release of Dragon Warrior references both Howard and Nester through character dialog, however this was removed in the later Game Boy Color version. He is mentioned in one line of dialogue in the game StarTropics. A DLC microgame in WarioWare D.I.Y. created by Nintendo Power called Funky Boxing (a loose reference to Nester's Funky Bowling) does not have any apparent references to the character, but if the game is opened in the editor, the player's boxer is named \\"NESTER.\\" ==Podcast== On December 20, 2017, Nintendo of America announced the official return of Nintendo Power in the form of a podcast, hosted by former Editor-in-Chief of the original magazine, Chris Slate. In the first episode, Slate states that the podcast was a \\"passion project\\" for Nintendo and that he wanted Nintendo Power to return. He also acknowledged that the format of that episode was experimental and that the frequency of the series' episodes hasn't been determined. Later in the episode, Slate interviews the developers of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and discusses the Nintendo Switch. ==See also== * Official Nintendo Magazine, the U.K. and Australian equivalent. * Nintendo Magazine System (Australia), the former Australian equivalent. * Nintendo Dream, the Japanese equivalent. * Club Nintendo, the Mexico and Latin America equivalent. * Nintendo World, the Brazil equivalent. * Nintendo Force, a spiritual successor. * Camp Hyrule, Nintendo's Internet-based community from 1995 to 2007, adjunct to Nintendo Power * History of computer and video games *Nintendo Power Line, a hotline for Nintendo Power readers for getting hints on Nintendo games ==References== ==External links== Archived Nintendo Power magazines on the Wayback Machine Archived Nintendo Power Advance magazines on the Internet Archive Category:1988 establishments in the United States Category:2012 disestablishments in the United States Category:Monthly magazines published in the United States Category:Video game magazines published in the United States Category:Defunct computer magazines published in the United States Category:House organs Category:Magazines about Nintendo Category:Magazines established in 1988 Category:Magazines disestablished in 2012 Category:Nintendo publications Category:Magazines published in San Francisco Category:2017 podcast debuts Category:Audio podcasts Category:Video game podcasts ","title":"Nintendo Power"},{"id":"823841","text":"Gaetano Filangieri Gaetano Filangieri (22 August 1753 ‚Äì 21 July 1788) was an Italian jurist and philosopher. Filangieri was born in San Sebastiano al Vesuvio, in the province of Naples, Italy in noble family of Filangieri. His father, Caesar, prince of Arianiello, intended him for a military career, which he commenced at the early age of seven, but soon abandoned for the study of the law. At the bar his knowledge and eloquence early secured his success, while his defence of a royal decree reforming abuses in the administration of justice gained him the favor of the king, Ferdinand IV of Naples, and his prime minister Bernardo Tanucci, and led to several honorable appointments at court. The first two books of his great work, La Scienza della legislazione, appeared in 1780. The first book contained an exposition of the rules on which legislation in general ought to proceed, while the second was devoted to economic questions. These two books showed him an ardent reformer, and vehement in denouncing the abuses of his time. He insisted on unlimited free trade, and the abolition of the mediaeval institutions which impeded production and national well-being. Its success was great and immediate not only in Italy, but throughout Europe at large. In 1783 he married, resigned his appointments at court, and retiring to Cava, devoted himself steadily to the completion of his work. In the same year appeared the third book, relating entirely to the principles of criminal jurisprudence. The suggestion which he made in it as to the need for reform in the Roman Catholic church brought upon him the censure of the ecclesiastical authorities, and it was condemned by the congregation of the Index in 1784. In 1785 he published three additional volumes, making the fourth book of the projected work, and dealing with education and morals. In 1787 he was appointed a member of the supreme treasury council by Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, but his health, impaired by close study and over-work in his new office, compelled his withdrawal to the country at Vico Equense. He died somewhat suddenly of tuberculosis on 21 July 1788, having just completed the first part of the fifth book of his Scienza. He left an outline of the remainder of the work, which was to have been completed in six books. La Scienza della legislazione has gone through many editions and translations. The best Italian edition is in 8 vols. 8vo. (1807). The Milan edition (1822) contains the Opusculi scelti and a life by Donato Tommasi. A French translation appeared in Paris in 7 vols. 8vo (1786‚Äì1798); it was republished in 1822-1824, with the addition of the Opuscies and notes by Benjamin Constant. According to the Gaetano Filangieri Philosophical Society, one of Filangieri's ardent admirers was Benjamin Franklin, and the two corresponded from 1780 until Filangieri's death in 1788. Carlo Filangieri, the soldier and statesman, was his son, and Gaetano Filangieri, prince of Satriano was his grandson. ==Bibliography== Giuseppe Grippa's La scienza della legislazione sindacata (1784), a critique to the work of Filangieri. *Riflessioni politiche su l'ultima legge del sovrano, che riguarda la riforma dell'amministrazione della giustizia, Naples 1774 *La scienza della legislazione, Naples, 1780-1785 *Reflexiones sobre la libertad del comercio de frutos, Madrid 1784 *Chiesa e convento di S.

He was a Democrat. ==Early life== Born in Greene County, Georgia, Fitzpatrick was orphaned at the age of seven, and was taken by his sister (Celia Fitzpatrick Baldwin) to Alabama in 1815. Fitzpatrick helped his brothers manage land they owned on the Alabama River and served as deputy under the first sheriff of Autauga County. He worked in the law office of Nimrod E. Benson before he was admitted to the bar. Fitzpatrick studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1821, commencing practice in Montgomery, Alabama. Fitzpatrick served as solicitor of the Montgomery circuit from 1822 to 1823 but moved to his plantation in Autauga County in 1829. He engaged in planting. ==Governor of Alabama and Senator for Alabama== Fitzpatrick became Governor of Alabama in 1841 and served until 1845. Later, he was appointed as a Democrat to the US Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Dixon H. Lewis, and served from November 25, 1848 to November 30, 1849, when a successor was elected. He was again appointed on January 14, 1853 and elected on December 12, 1853 to the Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of William R. King, who had been elected Vice President of the United States, and served from January 14, 1853 to March 3, 1855. He served in that Congress as Chairman of the Committee on Printing and the Committee on Engrossed Bills. He was elected to the Senate again to fill the vacancy caused by the failure of the legislature to elect his own successor on November 26, 1855. In that role, he served several times as President pro tempore of the Senate. ===Failure of state banks=== The country was plagued by economic depression as a result of the Panic of 1837. Fitzpatrick's predecessor as Governor, Arthur P. Bagby, introduced measures to assist the state banks, but the state legislature rejected most of the measures. All of the state banks were closed by Fitzpatrick. ==Vice Presidential nomination== In 1860, Fitzpatrick was nominated for Vice President of the United States by the wing of the Democratic Party that had nominated Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois for president. However, he refused the nomination, and Herschel V. Johnson of Georgia was ultimately nominated. Fitzpatrick withdrew from the Senate on January 21, 1861, following the secession of his home state. ==Confederacy== Fitzpatrick did not take a particularly active role in the politics of the Confederacy although he served as president of the constitutional convention of Alabama in 1865. ==Death== He died on his plantation near Wetumpka, Alabama, on November 21, 1869, aged 67. ==References== ==External links== * - - - - - - Category:1802 births Category:1869 deaths Category:Alabama Democrats Category:Democratic Party (United States) vice presidential nominees Category:Democratic Party state governors of the United States Category:Democratic Party United States senators Category:Governors of Alabama Category:People from Greene County, Georgia Category:Politicians from Montgomery, Alabama Category:Presidents pro tempore of the United States Senate Category:United States senators from Alabama Category:1860 United States vice-presidential candidates ","title":"Benjamin Fitzpatrick"},{"id":"823868","text":"George Robert Carter (December 28, 1866 ‚Äì February 11, 1933) was the second Territorial Governor of Hawaii, serving from 1903 to 1907. ==Early life and family== He was born December 28, 1866 in Honolulu. His mother was Sybil Augusta Judd (1843‚Äì1906), daughter of Gerrit P. Judd, and his father was businessman Henry Alpheus Peirce Carter. Carter was educated at Fort Street School in Honolulu (now McKinley High School), Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, and Yale University. He married Helen Strong, daughter of Eastman Kodak president Henry A. Strong April 19, 1892. They had four children: Elizabeth (born August 25, 1895), Phoebe (born September 27, 1897), a daughter who died on June 17, 1903, and George Robert, Jr. (born November 10, 1905). After Yale, Carter spent time serving an apprenticeship with Seattle National Bank. He formed a rowing club with W. B. Goodwin, fellow Hawaiian Hiram Bingham and Marshall Latham Bond, whose members turned their boats over to the University of Washington to begin its rowing program when it broke up. In 1895 Carter returned to Hawaii to become the cashier of C. Brewer & Co., where his father had been a senior partner from 1862 to 1874. From 1898 to 1902, he helped organize and manage the Hawaiian Trust Company, and was managing director of the Hawaiian Fertilizer Company. In addition, he served as a director for Bank of Hawaii, C. Brewer, and Alexander & Baldwin. ==Political career== Carter was elected to the Hawaii Territorial Senate from Oahu in 1901. While a territorial senator, he was sent to Washington as an unofficial agent to discuss territorial matters with President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt eventually appointed him Secretary of the Territory in 1902, and then Territorial Governor in 1903, succeeding Sanford B. Dole who resigned to become a federal judge. In 1905, during Carter's administration, the current system of county governments was created; the five county governments (Oahu, Maui, Kauai, Hawaii, and Kalawao) took effect on January 1, 1906. (Oahu County later became the City and County of Honolulu in 1909.) ==Final years and death== After his retirement and until his death on February 11, 1933 in Honolulu, Hawaii, Carter remained active in the community. Carter was a member of the Hawaiian Historical Society and engaged in historical research, collecting valuable books and documents. In 1922, Carter donated his collection to the Hawaiian Mission Children's Society, which continues to maintain it as well as the Mission Houses Museum. He was buried in Oahu Cemetery. Carter's estate was appraised at $1,153,902. His will provided for a $25,000 bequest to Kauikeolani Children's Hospital. His wife Helen Strong Carter received one-third of his estate, with his two living children receiving the remaining two-thirds.; ==ReferencesDescendants of Thomas Hastings website * Descendants of Thomas Hastings on Facebook Category:Members of the Hawaii Territorial Legislature Category:20th- century American politicians Category:Governors of the Territory of Hawaii Category:Phillips Academy alumni Category:Yale University alumni Category:Hawaii Republicans Category:1866 births Category:1933 deaths Category:Burials at Oahu Cemetery Category:Thomas Carter family ","title":"George R.

His father, Reverend Walter Frear, was born in Poughkeepsie, New York August 16, 1828, graduated from Yale in 1851, came to the Kingdom of Hawaii as a missionary, and then lived in California when he was born. His mother was Frances Elmira Foster. The family returned to Honolulu in 1870, where his father was pastor of the Fort Street Church until 1881. He graduated from Punahou School in 1881, Yale with a B.A. in 1885, and Yale law school in 1890. On August 1, 1893 he married Mary Emma Dillingham, the daughter of industrialist Benjamin Dillingham. They had two daughters: Virginia (1900‚Äì?) and Margaret (1908‚Äì?). He was appointed as circuit judge on January 1, 1893 by Queen Liliuokalani. On March 7, 1893 he was promoted to serve on the Supreme Court of the Provisional Government. After the death of Albert Francis Judd, on July 5, 1900 he became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of what was then the Territory of Hawaii. Frear was appointed governor after George R. Carter by President Theodore Roosevelt on August 15, 1907. Alfred S. Hartwell replaced him as Chief Justice. He was a member of the Republican Party of Hawaii. After the election of Woodrow Wilson, Frear was replaced by the first governor from the Democratic Party of Hawaii, Lucius Pinkham in November 1913. He died January 22, 1948 in Honolulu, Hawaii. The Frears founded the Mary D. and Walter F. Frear Eleemosynary Trust to sponsor educational projects. Frear Hall, a dormitory building built in the 1950s on the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus, was named after Governor Frear's wife Mary Dillingham Frear, a member of the University's Board of Regents from 1920‚Äì1943. The aging structure was demolished in 2006, to make way for a new dorm facility also called Frear Hall completed in the Summer of 2008. The Frear home, known as ‚ÄúArcadia,‚Äù was located at 1434 Punahou Street. It was built in 1907. Upon Mary's 1951 death it was donated to Punahou School. The property is currently occupied by Arcadia, a retirement residence. The Frear Center, located at 1132 Bishop Street, was named after Walter and Mary Frear. It is a classroom building of Hawaii Pacific University, and was designed for information systems and computer science courses. The trust also supported Chaminade University of Honolulu. ==Personal Life== Frear's father passed away on May 25, 1922 in Oakland, California. His mother was Frances Elmira Foster (January 29, 1836 in Boston, Massachusetts-February 7, 1924 in Oakland, California), and he had five siblings: Lizzie Lavina Freer, Hugo P. Frear, Henrietta Frear, Philip Foster Frear, Caroline Frear. Lizzie married Edward Frederick Woodward, who served as Mayor of Santa Rosa, California and as a California State Senator from 1903-1906. He was also named the Surveyor of the Port of San Francisco in 1909. Frear descends from the initial Freer immigrant to the United States, Huguenot refugee Hugo Freer, who was a patentee, or founder, of New Paltz, New York. He also descends from Louis DuBois (Huguenot), another patentee of New Paltz. His 2nd great-grandfather, Colonel Johannes \\"John\\" Freer, commanded his own regiment during the American Revolutionary War (4th Ulster County Regiment). His 4th cousins, once removed were J.

He translated Aucassin et Nicolette as Aucassin and Nicolet (1887), and he wrote the scholarly The Early Editions of the Roman de la Rose (1906) as well as Russia Reborn (1917) and various essays which the Religious Tract Society published. ==Family== Bourdillon married Agnes Smyth, and they lived at Buddington, near Midhurst. They had three children, including the World War I pilot and later medical researcher, Robert Benedict Bourdillon (1889‚Äì1971).

Pinkham was the first member of the Democratic Party of Hawaii to become governor. ==Early life== Pinkham was born September 19, 1850 in Chicopee, Massachusetts. His parents were Lucius Moulton, a cotton mill proprietor, and Caroline Smith (Fiske) Pinkham. He attended public schools in Boston and Hartford, Connecticut. Although he intended to attend Yale, a horseriding accident prevented him from walking for several years and he never attended college. Pinkham arrived in Hawaii in 1892 to build a coal handling plant for Oahu Railway and Land Company, and then went to California in 1894. From 1898 to 1903 he was manager of Pacific Hardware, another family business of Benjamin Dillingham. He also oversaw well projects for the sugarcane plantations. ==Hawaii Board of Health== On April 13, 1904, Pinkham was appointed president of the territorial Board of Health. While president of the Board of Health, he developed the idea of dredging the marshlands of Waikƒ´kƒ´ via a two-mile long drainage canal. Although the idea was approved by the Board of Health, no action was taken on the proposal. Over his two terms, Pinkham's achievements included improving the conditions of the lepers at the Molokai settlement, economically reducing the occurrence of bubonic plague and cholera in Hawaii. In 1907, Pinkham's remarks on the Japanese community's behavior during a bubonic plague outbreak were found to be offensive, and the Japanese community's reaction was a major factor in Governor Frear's decision to not reappoint Pinkham for another term. Pinkham was removed from the Board of Health on April 12, 1908. ==Hawaiian Sugar Planter's Association== In April 1909, Pinkham was employed as a labor commissioner by the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association (HSPA) to help transport Filipino labor recruits to Hawaii. After four years, the HSPA ended Pinkham's contract \\"because of differences of opinion about the methods and purposes of recruiting Filipino workers.\\" ==Territorial Governor of Hawaii== Despite having no previous political experience, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson appointed Pinkham territorial governor of Hawaii on November 29, 1913, succeeding Governor Walter Frear. His appointment was controversial among Hawaii Democrats. The U.S. Senate confirmed Pinkham's appointment by a vote of 46-24, by just one vote more than the two-thirds necessary for confirmation. Pinkham was the state's first governor from the Democratic Party, although his affiliations with the Republican Party were often under question. In 1917, during Pinkham's governorship, the deposed former monarch of the Hawaiian Islands, Queen Liliuokalani, died and was buried at the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii. The construction of what would become the Ala Wai Canal and the drainage of the Waikƒ´kƒ´ marshlands are credited for enabling the development of Waikƒ´kƒ´ as a tourist center, and are considered to be one of the most enduring legacies of Pinkham's tenure. Pinkham also worked aggressively to improve the military defense of Hawaii. He voluntarily resigned from his position and was replaced by Charles J. McCarthy on June 22, 1918. Pinkham died November 2, 1922 in San Francisco, California. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Governors of the Territory of Hawaii Category:People from Chicopee, Massachusetts Category:1850 births Category:1922 deaths Category:Hawaii Democrats Category:Members of the Hawaii Board of Health ","title":"Lucius E.

McCarthy was born August 4, 1861 in Boston, Massachusetts, to Charles McCarthy and Joana (McCarthy) McCarthy. McCarthy moved with his parents to San Francisco, California in 1866. He was a marginal entrepreneur who came to Hawaii to manage the affairs of a wholesale fruit house. McCarthy owned a saloon and for a time bottled his own alcoholic beverages. He was a member of the House of Nobles in 1890, supporter of Liliuokalani and ironically a captain in the pro- annexation Honolulu Rifles. He also was a territorial senator 1907-12 and treasurer 1912-14 before becoming chief executive. He was co-founder of the Hawai'i Democratic Party. He was appointed by President of the United States Woodrow Wilson to the office after the term of Lucius E. Pinkham. McCarthy believed Republicans were promoting immigration of Oriental laborers to manipulate Hawaii‚Äôs demographics to their advantage and served their own business interests, McCarthy was ardently anti-Asian. He appointed Charles Rice and Alfred Castle to lobby in favor of the Hawaiian Rehabilitation Bill which became the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act . The omnibus bill also contained language that made it difficult for ‚ÄúOrientals‚Äù from winning homesteads, and barred them from federal jobs in favor of Hawaiians. McCarthy also proposed that the military replace self-government in order to negate possible bloc voting by the large Japanese population in Hawaii. When asked by a congressman if the Japanese would think the action was directed at them, McCarthy said, ‚ÄúLet them think so; what do we care?‚Äù McCarthy also railed against the land policies of the Big Five and was the first governor to advocate statehood for Hawaii. Annoyed by the policies of his Democratic administration, McCarthy was gently nudged out of politics by Republicans. In return, he was given a job as Washington representative of the Honolulu Chamber of Commerce, and later general manager of Hawaiian Dredging Co. during which he worked on the Waikiki Reclamation project which resulted in the construction of the Ala Wai Canal.

Judd, who was an early American Missionary, a cabinet minister to King Kamehameha III, and co-founder of Punahou School. His father was Judge Albert Francis Judd (1838‚Äì1900) and mother was Agnes Hall Boyd (1844‚Äì1934). He was the last of nine children. He was married March 6, 1909, at Richmond Hill, New York, to Florence Bell Hackett (1885‚Äì1974) and had five children: Helen Florence (1909-?), Agnes Elizabeth (1912-?), Sophie Janet (1913‚Äì?), Lawrence McCully Jr. (1917‚Äì?) and Emilie Bell (1920‚Äì?).

As territorial governor, he overhauled the system of governance in the colony. A source of controversy during his tenure, Judd commuted the sentence of Grace Hubbard Fortescue, socialite and niece of Alexander Graham Bell, convicted in the territorial courts of manslaughter in the death of a local man, Joseph Kahahawai. Hiring defense lawyer Clarence Darrow, Fortescue's case was known as the Massie Affair, a focus of nationwide newspaper coverage. Massie's sentence of ten years in prison was whittled down to one hour in the governor's chambers at Iolani Palace. The affair was the subject of a 2005 episode of the PBS series The American Experience, with some archival footage of Judd. ===Resident superintendent=== Judd became Kalaupapa's resident superintendent in 1947.

Overseas Service Bars are displayed as an embroidered gold bar worn horizontally on the right sleeve of the Class A uniform and the Army Service Uniform.Department of the Army. Army Regulation 670-1, Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia Washington, DC: 2014. Chapter 21, Paragraph 29. Overseas Service Bars are cumulative, in that each bar worn indicates another six-month period. Time spent overseas is also cumulative, meaning one bar could be earned for two separate deployments totaling six months. The Overseas Service Bars shown here as ‚ÄòKorea‚Äô were used as Overseas Service Bars in World War II. ==Background== The original concept of an Overseas Bar began in the First World War with what was known as an Overseas Chevron. An Overseas Chevron was an inverted chevron patch of gold metallic thread on olive drab backing worn on the lower left sleeve on the standard Army dress uniform over the Service Stripes. The chevron was identical to the Wound Chevron which was worn on the opposite right sleeve. Originally, in 1917, service chevrons came in three colors - *Silver Chevron Stateside War Service for 6 months. *Gold Chevron Overseas War Service for 6 months. *Powder Blue Chevron Overseas War Service for less than 6 months. A soldier's overseas service was calculated from the day they disembarked in Britain or France. Sailors and Marines who served in the European war zone aboard a ship for 6 months (i.e. Shipboard Service) wore their chevron point upwards. If they served ashore, they qualified for the Overseas War Service chevron. (Overseas service chevrons were discontinued by the Navy and Marine Corps after the First World War.) During World War II, the chevron was redesignated as the Overseas Bar and the insignia adopted its current design of a horizontal bar. (During WWII, it was often informally referred to as a \\"Hershey bar.\\") For those who had performed overseas service in both the First and Second World Wars, the Overseas Bar and Chevron were worn together. In 1953, the Overseas Service Bar had adopted its current name and the patch was then worn on the lower right sleeve, instead of the left. (Wound Chevrons, previously worn on the right sleeve, were replaced by the Purple Heart decoration upon its creation in 1932.) Prior to the recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, it was rare for an individual to have more than four Overseas Service Bars. Due to the protracted nature of the recent conflicts with resulting multiple deployments, it is not unusual for senior officers and NCOs to have eight or more Overseas Service Bars. The Overseas Service Bar is a separate award from the Overseas Service Ribbon, established in 1981, which recognizes overseas service in any location outside of the continental United States (CONUS), without regard as to whether or not the area has been designated a combat zone. Regulations permit receiving both awards for the same qualifying period of service. ==Current regulation== Army Regulation 670-1, Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia, dated 25 May 2017 in Chapter 19, Paragraph 28 states the following: 19-28. Overseas service bars a. Authorized wearers. Soldiers are authorized to wear one overseas service bars for each 6‚Äìmonth period of active Federal service as a member of a U.S. Service as indicated below. Periods of less than 6 months duration, which otherwise meets the requirements for the award of overseas service bars, may be combined by adding the number of months to determine creditable service toward the total number of overseas service bars authorized. Listed beginning dates and ending dates are inclusive. The months of arrival to, and departure from the designated area are counted as whole months. (1) Outside CONUS, between 7 December 1941 and 2 September 1946. In computing overseas service, Alaska is considered outside CONUS. An overseas service bar is not authorized for a fraction of a 6‚Äìmonth period. (2) Korea, between 27 June 1950 and 27 July 1954. Credit toward an overseas service bar is authorized for each month of active Federal service as a member of the U.S. Army serving in the designated hostile fire area in Korea between 1 April 1968 and 31 August 1973. The months of arrival to, and departure from the hostile fire pay area are counted as whole months. If a Soldier receives a month of hostile fire pay for a period(s) of service in Korea, then the Soldier may also receive credit for a corresponding month towards award of an overseas service bar. (3) Vietnam, between 1 July 1958 and 28 March 1973. The months of arrival to, and departure from Vietnam are counted as whole months for credit toward the overseas service bar. If a Soldier receives a month of hostile fire pay for a period(s) of TDY service in Vietnam, then the Soldier may also receive credit for a corresponding month towards award of an overseas service bar.

He was brother to Florestano Pepe and cousin to Gabriele Pepe. He was married to Mary Ann Coventry, a Scottish woman who was the widow of John Borthwick Gilchrist, linguist and surgeon to the East India Company. ==Biography== Pepe was born at Squillace in Calabria. He entered the army at an early age, but in 1799 he took part in the Neapolitan Republic, inspired by the French Revolution. While fighting against the Bourbon troops, which were led by Cardinal Ruffo, he was captured and exiled to France. He entered Napoleon's army and served with distinction in several campaigns, including those in the Neapolitan kingdom: first under Joseph Bonaparte, and later under Joachim Murat. After commanding a Neapolitan brigade in the Peninsular campaign, Pepe returned to Italy in 1813, with the rank of general, to help reorganize the Neapolitan army. When news of the fall of Napoleon (1814) reached Italy, Pepe and several other generals tried, without success, to force Murat to grant a constitution as the only means of saving the kingdom from foreign invasion and the return of the Bourbons. On Napoleon's escape from Elba (1815) Murat, after some hesitation, placed himself on the emperor's side and waged war against the Austrians, with Pepe on his staff. After several engagements the Neapolitans were forced to retire after the Battle of Tolentino (in which Pepe participated), and eventually agreed to the Treaty of Casalanza, according to which Murat was to abandon the kingdom; but the Neapolitan officers retained their rank under Ferdinand IV, who now regained the throne of Naples. While engaged in suppressing brigandage in the Capitanata, Pepe organized the carbonari into a national militia, intending to use them for political purposes. He had hoped that the king would grant a constitution; but when that hope failed he contemplated seizing Ferdinand, the emperor of Austria, and Metternich, who were expected at Avellino, in order to compel them to install a liberal constitution in Italy (1819). The scheme broke down through an accident, but in the following year a military rising broke out, the mutineers cheering for the king and the constitution. Pepe himself was sent against them; but while he was deciding on which course to follow, Ferdinand promised a constitution (July 1820). A revolt in Sicily having been repressed, Pepe was appointed inspector-general of the army. Meanwhile, the king, who had no intention of respecting the constitution, went to the Congress of Laibach to confer with the sovereigns of the holy alliance assembled there, leaving his son as regent. The king obtained the loan of an Austrian army with which to restore absolute power, while the regent dallied with the Liberals. Pepe, who in parliament had spoken in favour of deposing the king, now took command of the army and marched against the Austrians. He attacked them at Rieti (March, 1821), but his raw levies were repulsed. The army was gradually disbanded. Pepe then spent several years in England, France and other countries, publishing a number of books and pamphlets of a political character and keeping up his connection with the Carbonari. When the 1848 revolution and war broke out all over Italy, Pepe returned to Naples, where a constitution had again been proclaimed. He was given command of the Neapolitan army, which was to co-operate with Piedmont against the Austrians. However, when he reached Bologna, the king, who had already changed his mind, recalled him and his troops. Pepe, after hesitating between his desire to fight for Italy and his oath to the king, resigned his commission in the Neapolitan service and crossed the Po with 2,000 volunteers to take part in the campaign. After a good deal of fighting in Venetia, he joined Manin in the siege of Venice and took command of the defending army. When the city was forced by hunger to surrender to the Austrians, Pepe and Manin were among those excluded from the amnesty. He again went into exile and died in Turin in 1855. ==Works== *Relazione delle circostanze relative agli avvenimenti politici e militari in Napoli nel 1820 e 1821 [...] (1822) *Memorie (1847) *L'Italie politique et ses rapports avec la France et l'Angleterre (1848) *Casi d'Italia negli anni 1847, 48 e 49 : continuazione delle memorie del generale Guglielmo Pepe (1851) ==References== Category:1783 births Category:1855 deaths Category:Italian commanders of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Italian military personnel of the Napoleonic Wars Category:18th-century Italian people Category:19th-century Italian people Category:People from Squillace Category:Italian generals Category:Italian soldiers Category:French soldiers Category:Italian people of the Italian unification Category:People of the First Italian War of Independence Category:Italian exiles ","title":"Guglielmo Pepe"},{"id":"823923","text":"Boris Alterman 1998 at Recklinghausen Boris Alterman (, ; born May 4, 1970) is an Israeli chess Grandmaster, FIDE Senior Trainer (2010), advisor of the Junior chess program.Shevah-Mofet school chess program He started playing chess at the age of 7.

He attended Wesleyan University and earned his LL.B. degree from Washington University in St. Louis. He was admitted to the Montana Bar in 1892, and served as County Attorney of Beaverhead County, Montana from 1897 to 1903. He was appointed judge of the Fifth Judicial District in Beaverhead, Madison, and Jefferson Counties, Montana in 1909. He later served as a district judge in Montana from 1909 to 1915, and he later served as Attorney General of Montana from 1915 to 1917. ==Career== In 1917, President Woodrow Wilson appointed Poindexter as Judge on the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii. Poindexter served in that capacity from May 14, 1917 to February 16, 1924. He then practiced law in Hawaii until 1934. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Poindexter the eighth governor of Hawaii on January 30, 1934. A joint Congressional Committee visited Hawaii in 1937 and submitted a report in February 1938 recommending a plebiscite for Hawaii statehood. The plebiscite, held on November 5, 1940, resulted in the voters recommending statehood for Hawaii. Poindexter was appointed to the governorship of Hawaii by Roosevelt in 1934; he was reappointed to the governorship in 1938. Poindexter was the only second territorial governor to that point to serve more than one term of office. In the immediate aftermath of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Poindexter placed the territory under martial law and allowed the U.S. military to form a military government. He mobilized the Hawaii Territorial Guard while the attack was still ongoing and appointed himself its captain general. The military government would continue until 1943. After his term expired, Poindexter remained in office until August 24, 1942, when his successor, Ingram Stainback, was confirmed. He remained in Hawaii and practiced law and in July 1943, the Hawaii supreme Court appointed him as one of the trustees of the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate. ===Gubernatorial accomplishments=== An editorial at his death credited Poindexter with a balanced budget, improved civil service and wage laws that regulated child labor and improved public health and welfare. During his administration the Hawaii Housing Authority was established, and projects such as the \\"Mayor Wright homes\\" (named for George F. Wright) were begun. He advocated for larger airports and other major public works projects, including roads, parks, schools and the Ala Wai Golf Course. credited to Honolulu Advertiser December 7, 1951 ==Later life== Poindexter resumed his law practice after leaving the governorship. In July 1943, the Hawaii Supreme Court appointed him a trustee of the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate (now Kamehameha Schools), in which capacity he served until his death in Honolulu, Hawaii on December 3, 1951.

He served as the ninth Territorial Governor of Hawaii from 1942 to 1951. ==Early life== Stainback was born in 1883 in Somerville, Tennessee. His father, Charles A. Stainback Sr, was a lawyer and his brother, Charles A. Stainback, was a Democratic state senator. Stainback received his undergraduate degree from Princeton University and his Juris Doctor from the University of Chicago. Tombstone of Ingram Macklin Stainback, Oahu Cemetery ==Career== Stainback, a well-connected Democrat, came to Hawaii shortly after graduation and was appointed by Democratic Governor Lucius E. Pinkham in 1914 to the post of Territorial Attorney General. He resigned in 1917 to join the Army and rose to the rank of major. When the war ended he returned to private practice in Hawaii. Previous to his administration, Stainback was a United States District Attorney and then a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Territory of Hawaii. He was appointed to the office by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It is likely that his friendships with then-Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Senator Kenneth McKellar, both Tennesseans, played a role in his appointment. However, Stainback was essentially powerless for the first two years of his term since Gov. Joseph B. Poindexter had allowed the military to take over the government on December 7, 1941. During that time, Hawaii was governed by Army generals Walter Short, Delos Emmons, and Robert C. Richardson, Jr. A conservative Democrat, Stainback, whose full powers were restored on April 13, 1944, played a significant role in the lifting of martial law in wartime Hawaii. Stainback believed Communists were plotting to take over the Hawaiian Islands. He also provided a genesis for Hawaii's Democratic Revolution of 1954 by decrying the land monopolies in Hawaii and calling for land reform. Upon resigning his post on May 8, 1951, Stainback had served eight years, eight months and six days, the longest of any appointed governor up to that point. On September 26, 1951, he was appointed by President Harry S. Truman as an associate judge to the Hawaii Supreme Court. Stainback argued for Commonwealth status similar to Puerto Rico instead of statehood, arguing that Hawaii would benefit from the federal tax exemption. ==Death and legacy== Stainback died in 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii and is buried at Oahu Cemetery. Stainback is memorialized on the island of Hawaii by the Stainback Highway, a little-used 18-mile road that leads from the Hawaii Belt Road near Hilo at to Kulani Correctional Facility, a medium security state prison at . His son, Macklin Fleming, was an Associate Justice of the California Court of Appeal and an early opponent of affirmative action.http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/Fleming_Macklin_Biography.pdf ==References== == External links == Category:Governors of the Territory of Hawaii Category:Territory of Hawaii judges Category:Princeton University alumni Category:University of Chicago Law School alumni Category:1883 births Category:1961 deaths Category:Justices of the Hawaii Supreme Court Category:Hawaii Democrats Category:20th-century American judges Category:Burials at Oahu Cemetery Category:People from Somerville, Tennessee ","title":"Ingram Stainback"},{"id":"823954","text":"Samuel Wilder King (December 17, 1886March 24, 1959) was the eleventh Territorial Governor of Hawaii and served from 1953 to 1957. He was appointed to the office after the term of Oren E. Long. Previously, King served in the United States House of Representatives as a delegate from the Territory of Hawaii. He was a member of the Republican Party of Hawaii and was the first of native Hawaiian descent to rise to the highest office in the territory. ==Education== His father James A. King (1832‚Äì1899) was a ship's master for Samuel Gardner Wilder, and later politician in the Republic of Hawaii. His mother was Charlotte Holmes Davis, daughter of part-Hawaiian Robert Grimes Davis, who descended from Oliver Holmes, Governor of O ªahu under Kamehameha I. King was born December 17, 1886 in Honolulu and was a subject of the Kingdom of Hawai'i. A devout Roman Catholic, King attended Saint Louis School, but graduated from McKinley High School. Upon graduating, King went on to study at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. He entered the United States Navy as a commissioned officer where he served from 1910 to 1924. At the time of his discharge, he had attained the rank of lieutenant commander. On March 18, 1912 he married Pauline Nawahineokalai Evans, another part- Hawaiian. ==Early career== King returned to his hometown in 1925 where he entered the real estate profession. In 1932, he ran for his first public office and served for two years on the Board of Supervisors of Honolulu. In 1934, King was elected to the United States Congress as a delegate. He served in Washington, D.C. from January 1935 to January 1943. With the outbreak of World War II, King resigned from Congress to accept a naval commission to become a commander, then captain. He retired from military service in 1946. ==Later career== Once again, King returned to his hometown and was appointed to a sub-cabinet office of the governor's administration. King served in the Emergency Housing Committee for a year. He was then appointed to the Hawaii Statehood Commission in 1947 where he stayed until 1953. President of the United States Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed King to the governorship that year. He was the first governor of Hawaiian ancestry. He served in  ªIolani Palace until his resignation on July 31, 1957. During his term in office he signed HB 706 on June 5, 1957 which outlawed the death penalty in Hawaii. It became Act 282. He died in Honolulu March 24, 1959, just before Hawaii achieved statehood. He was buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. His son Samuel Pailthorpe King (1916‚Äì2010) became a lawyer and Federal Judge. His grandson, Samuel Pailthorpe King, Jr. also became a lawyer and in 1985 established his own law practice with his wife, Adrienne King, also a lawyer, as King and King, Attorneys-At-Law. His great-grandson, Samuel Wilder King II, is also a lawyer now practicing in Honolulu, and in 2015, he named his own son Samuel Wilder King III. ==See also== *List of Asian Americans and Pacific Islands Americans in the United States Congress ==References== - Category:1886 births Category:1959 deaths Category:20th- century American politicians Category:American military personnel of World War I Category:American naval personnel of World War II Category:American people of Native Hawaiian descent Category:Delegates to the United States House of Representatives from the Territory of Hawaii Category:Governors of the Territory of Hawaii Category:Hawaii Republicans Category:Native Hawaiian politicians Category:People from Honolulu Category:Tanager Expedition Category:United States Naval Academy alumni Category:United States Navy officers ","title":"Samuel Wilder King"},{"id":"823977","text":"Glen Walter Edwards (March 5, 1916 ‚Äì June 5, 1948) was a test pilot for the United States Air Force, and is the namesake of Edwards Air Force Base. ==Early life== Edwards was born March 5, 1916, in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada, where he lived until 1931. At age 13, his parents Claude Gustin Edwards, a real estate salesman, and Mary Elizabeth (n√©e Briggeman) Edwards moved the family to California, settling in Lincoln, northeast of Sacramento. He attended Lincoln High School, where he was a member of the Spanish Club and worked on the school newspaper, \\"El Eco\\". After graduating from high school in 1936, he attended Placer Junior College in Auburn, California, eventually transferring to UC Berkeley.This day in aviation - Glen Edwards bio ==World War IINorth Africa and southern Italy=== After graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, Edwards enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces on July 15, 1941, five months before Pearl Harbor, as an aviation cadet. Upon completion of flight training, he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant at Luke Field, Arizona, in February 1942. Assigned to the 86th Light Bombardment Squadron of the 47th Bombardment Group, he departed for the North African Theater of Operations (Tunisia) as a flight commander in October 1942. There he led his flight of A-20s on extremely hazardous, low-level missions against German tanks, convoys, troop concentrations, bridges, airfields, and a variety of other tactical targets. When the Germans broke through the Kasserine Pass in February 1943, his undermanned and undersupplied squadron flew eleven missions in a single day, repeatedly attacking advancing armored columns and blunting their thrust. On one of these missions, Edwards and his crew set a record by completing a combat mission‚Äîfrom takeoff to landing‚Äîin just 19 minutes. His squadron received a Distinguished Unit Citation for this action. During his tours in the North African campaign and the invasion of Sicily, Edwards completed 50 combat missions and was awarded four Distinguished Flying Crosses and six Air Medals. Returning to the United States in December 1943, he was assigned to the Pilot Standardization Board at Florence Army Air Field, South Carolina, and then, in late 1944, to the Flight Test Division at Wright Field, Ohio. He graduated from the Air Materiel Command Flight Performance School (initial designation of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School) (Class 45) there in May 1945 and was assigned to the Bomber Test Operations Section. ==Post warThe first test flights=== Although assigned to Wright Field, he spent much of his time at Muroc Army Air Field, in California's high desert, testing a wide variety of experimental prototypes such as Douglas' highly unconventional pusher-prop light bomber, the XB-42 Mixmaster. In December 1945, he and Lieutenant Colonel Henry E. Warden set a new transcontinental speed record when they flew this airplane from Long Beach, California, to Bolling Air Force Base, in Washington, D.C., in just five hours, 17 minutes. In 1946, he was the principal project pilot for the jet-powered Convair XB-46 prototype bomber. It was also during this period that he acquired his first experience with a flying wing, as he familiarized himself with the flying qualities of the Northrop N-9M, a single-seat, one-third scale mock-up of the giant XB-35 prototype bomber. His superb skills as a pilot, engineer and officer were held in such high esteem that his immediate superior, Major Robert Cardenas, recommended him as project pilot for an unprecedented program‚Äîthe first attempt to exceed the speed of sound in the Bell X-1. That assignment, however, went to Capt. Chuck Yeager. ===University=== Edwards was, instead, selected to be among the first to be sent to Princeton University for graduate study in the aeronautical sciences. The recent war had spawned truly revolutionary advances in aviation technology and it had become apparent to men such as Col. Albert Boyd, the chief of the Flight Test Division, that a new breed of military test pilot‚Äîone who combined the talents of a highly skilled pilot with the technical expertise of an engineer‚Äîwould be required to effectively evaluate increasingly complex aircraft and onboard systems. Thus, when Glen Edwards graduated from Princeton with a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 1947, he represented one of the first of this new breed. ==Death== In May 1948, Edwards was selected to join the team of test pilots and engineers at Muroc who were then evaluating the Northrop YB-49, the all-jet version of the exotic flying wing bomber. After his first few flights, he was not favorably impressed, confiding to his diary that it was \\"the darndest airplane I've ever tried to do anything with. Quite uncontrollable at times.\\" Then, on June 5, 1948, he was flying as co-pilot with Maj. Daniel Forbes when the airplane departed from controlled flight and broke apart in the sky northwest of the base. All five crew members were killed. Glen Edwards Grave Lincoln Cemetery ==Tributes== One of Col. Boyd's first orders of business, when he assumed command of Muroc in late 1949, was to rename the base in honor of someone who had given his life to the cause of experimental flight research. By tradition, Air Force bases were named after distinguished individuals who were native sons of the state in which a base was located. Boyd could think of no one more deserving than the bright, young, Canadian- born Californian whose promising career had ended in the skies over the western Mojave. On December 8, 1949, Muroc Air Force Base was officially redesignated 'Edwards Air Force Base' and, during ceremonies on January 27, 1950, a plaque was unveiled that commemorates his achievements. That plaque is now located in a place of honor in front of the headquarters of the Air Force Flight Test Center. The tribute at its base reads: \\"A pioneer of the Flying Wing in the western skies, with courage and daring unrecognized by himself.\\" In 1995, Edwards was inducted into the Aerospace Walk of Honor. In 2008, the family of Captain Edwards donated his diaries to the Air Force Flight Test Center museum. The diaries describe Edwards' experiences during World War II, from when he joined the Army Air Corps, up to a few days before he died. There is a middle school in Lincoln, California, named after Edwards. ==Notes== ==References== Ford, Daniel: Glen Edwards: The Diary of a Bomber Pilot (Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1998) ==External links== *Glen Edwards and the Flying Wing *Edward AFB History Office biography *A Toast to Glen Edwards *Check-Six.com - Crash site of the YB-49 - Includes full crew list Category:1918 births Category:1948 deaths Category:Canadian aviators Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:United States Army Air Forces officers Category:People from Medicine Hat Category:Aviators killed in aviation accidents or incidents in the United States Category:Accidental deaths in California Category:Canadian emigrants to the United States Category:U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School alumni Category:American test pilots Category:Engineers from California Category:United States Army Air Forces pilots of World War II Category:Recipients of the Air Medal Category:Princeton University alumni Category:People from Lincoln, California Category:American aviation record holders Category:20th-century American engineers Category:Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in 1948 ","title":"Glen Edwards (pilot)"},{"id":"824008","text":"Paulaner Dunkel Dunkel, or Dunkles, is a word used for several types of dark German lager. Dunkel is the German word meaning dark, and dunkel beers typically range in color from amber to dark reddish brown. They are characterized by their smooth malty flavor. In informal terms, such as when ordering at a bar, \\"dunkel\\" is likely to mean whatever dark beer the bar has on tap, or sells most of; in much of north and western Germany, especially near D√ºsseldorf, this may be Altbier. In Bavaria, Dunkel, along with helles, is a traditional style brewed in Munich and popular throughout Bavaria. With alcohol concentrations of 4.5% to 6% by volume, dunkels are weaker than Doppelbocks, another traditional dark Bavarian beer. Dunkels are produced using Munich malts which give the Dunkel its color. Other malts or flavors may also be added. Many dunkels have a distinctive malty flavor that comes from a special brewing technique called decoction mashing. Most commonly, dunkel beers are dark lagers, but the term is also used to refer to dark wheat beers such as Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse Dunkel. Dunkel weizen is another term used to refer to dark wheat beers, which are fruity and sweet with more dark, roasted malts than their lighter counterpart, the hefeweizen. ==Munich dunkel== Dunkels were the original style of the Bavarian villages and countryside, and it was the most common style at the time of the introduction of the Reinheitsgebot (1516). As such, it is the first \\"fully codified and regulated\\" beer. Its ABV is rarely higher than 5.5%, and it has low bitterness, a distinctive dark color, and a malty flavor. Dunkel is brewed using lager yeasts. Lighter-colored lagers were not common until the later part of the 19th century when technological advances made them easier to produce. ==Franconian dunkel== Dunkel is also widespread in parts of Franconia, for example the Franconian Switzerland, where it has been originally the most common beer type. The region has a lot of microbreweries, of which many still produce Dunkel. One Example is Weissenohe Abbey Brewery (Weissenoher Klosterbrauerei). ==Examples== * Aktienbrauerei Kaufbeuren Dunkel * Andechser Dunkel * Augustiner Dunkel * Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel * Dunkel Fester A dunkel-style beer brewed in the UK by the Wychwood Brewery * Erdinger Dunkel * Franconia Brewing Company German Dunkel * Hacker-Pschorr M√ºnchner Dunkel * Hofbr√§u M√ºnchen Dunkel * K√∂nig Ludwig Dunkel * L√∂wenbr√§u Dunkel * Paulaner Original M√ºnchner Dunkel * Spaten M√ºnchen Dunkel * Warsteiner Premium Dunkel * Weihenstephaner Tradition Bayrisch Dunkel * Weltenburg Abbey Weltenburger Kloster Barock Dunkel ==See also== * Doppelbock * German beer * Helles * Schwarzbier ==References == ==External links== * Munich Dunkel ‚Äì by K.

He was known mostly for his works based on literature, with paintings based on the works of Dante, Goethe, and Lord Byron, as well as religious subjects. He was also a prolific painter of portraits of famous and influential people in his lifetime. Politically, Scheffer had strong ties to King Louis Philippe I, having been employed as a teacher of the latter's children, which allowed him to live a life of luxury for many years until the French Revolution of 1848. ==Life== Statue of Scheffer on the Scheffersplein in Dordrecht, made by Joseph Mezzara after a design by Scheffer's daughter, Cornelia. Scheffer's house in Paris, France, now the Mus√©e de la Vie romantique (Museum of Romantic Life) Scheffer was the son of Johan Bernard Scheffer (1765‚Äì1809), a portrait painter who was born in Homberg upon Ohm or Kassel (both presently in Germany) and moved to the Netherlands in his youth, and Cornelia Lamme (1769‚Äì1839), a portrait miniature painter and daughter of landscape painter Arie Lamme of Dordrecht, for whom Arij (later \\"Ary\\") was named. Ary Scheffer had two brothers, the journalist and writer Karel Arnold Scheffer (1796‚Äì1853) and the painter Hendrik Scheffer (1798‚Äì1862). His parents educated him and he attended the drawing academy in Amsterdam from the age of 11 years. In 1808 his father became the court painter of Louis Bonaparte in Amsterdam, yet his father died one year later. Encouraged by Willem Bilderdijk, Ary moved to Lille, France for further study after the death of his father. In 1811 he and his mother, who greatly influenced his career, moved to Paris, France, where he studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts as a pupil of Pierre-Narcisse Gu√©rin. His brothers followed them to Paris later.Scheffer, Arij (1795‚Äì1858) in the Biographical Dictionary of the Netherlands: 1880‚Äì2000 (in Dutch) Scheffer started exhibiting at the Salon de Paris in 1812. He began to be recognized in 1817, and in 1819 he was asked to make a portrait of the Marquis de Lafayette. Perhaps because of Lafayette's acquaintances, Scheffer and his brothers were politically active throughout their lives and he became a prominent Philhellene. In 1822 he became drawing teacher to the children of Louis Philippe I, the Duke of Orl√©ans. Because of his connection with them, he obtained many commissions for portraiture and other work. In 1830 riots against the rule of King Charles X resulted in his overthrow. On 30 July, Scheffer and influential journalist Adolphe Thiers rode from Paris to Orl√©ans to ask Louis Philippe I to lead the resistance, and a few days later he became \\"King of the French\\". That same year, Scheffer's daughter Corn√©lia was born. He registered the name of her mother as \\"Maria Johanna de Nes\\", but nothing is known of her and she may have died soon after Cornelia's birth. Considering that his grandmother's name was \\"Johanna de Nes\\", it has been speculated that he kept the name of Cornelia's mother secret so as not to compromise the reputation of a noble family. Cornelia Scheffer (1830‚Äì1899) became a sculptor and painter in her own right.Scheffer, Cornelia (1830‚Äì1899) in the Biographical Dictionary of the Netherlands: 1880‚Äì2000 (in Dutch) Scheffer's mother did not know of her namesake granddaughter until 1837, after which she cared for her until she died only two years later. Scheffer became an associate member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands in 1846, and resigned in 1851. Scheffer and his family prospered during the reign of Louis Philippe I, who abdicated on 24 February 1848. Scheffer and Hendrik were inundated with artistic commissions, and they taught numerous students in their workshop in Paris, so many that of the works produced during this period that bear his signature the number that he actually made himself cannot be verified. Scheffer was elevated as commander of the Legion of Honour in 1848. As a captain of the Garde Nationale he escorted the French royal family in its escape from the Tuileries and escorted the Duchess d'Orl√©ans to the Chambre des D√©put√©s, where she in vain proposed her son as the next monarch of France. Scheffer fought in the army of Cavaignac during the June Days Uprising in Paris of 23 to 26 June 1848. The cruelty and hatred that the governmental faction exhibited and the misery of the lower classes so shocked him that he withdrew from politics and refused to make portraits of the family of Napol√©on III, who reigned after the Uprising. On 16 March 1850 he married Sophie Marin, the widow of General Baudrand, and on 6 November of that year he finally became a French citizen. He continued to frequently travel to the Netherlands, and traveled to Belgium, Germany, and England, but a heart condition impaired his activity and eventually caused his death in 1858 in his summer house in Argenteuil. He is buried in the Cimeti√®re de Montmartre. ==Works== When Scheffer left Gu√©rin's studio, Romanticism had come into vogue in France, with such painters as Xavier Sigalon, Eug√®ne Delacroix and Th√©odore G√©ricault. Scheffer did not show much affinity with their work and developed his own style, which has been called \\"frigidly classical\\".Murray, P. & L. (1996), Dictionary of art and artists. Penguin Books. . Francesca da Rimini and Paolo Malatesta Appraised by Dante and Virgil, 1854 Scheffer often painted subjects from literature, especially the works of Dante, Byron and Goethe. Two versions of Dante and Beatrice have been preserved at Wolverhampton Art Gallery, United Kingdom, and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, US. Particularly highly praised was his Francesca da Rimini, painted in 1836, which illustrates a scene from Dante Alighieri's Inferno. In the piece the entwined bodies of Francesca di Rimini and Paolo Malatesta swirl around in the never-ending tempest that is the second circle of Hell. The illusion of movement is created by the drapery that envelopes the couple, as well as by Francesca's flowing hair. These two figures create a diagonal line that intersects the majority of the canvas creating not only a sense of movement, but also giving the painting an air of instability. Francesca clings to Paolo as he turns his face away in anguish. There are an additional two figures in the image: hidden in the background, the poets Dante and Virgil look on as they make their way through the nine circles of Hell. Scheffer's popular Faust-themed paintings include Margaret at her wheel; Faust doubting; Margaret at the Sabbat; Margaret leaving church; The garden walk, and Margaret at the well. In 1836, he painted two pictures of Goethe's character Mignon: Mignon desires her fatherland (1836), and Mignon yearns for heaven (1851). Temptation of Christ, 1854 He now turned to religious subjects: Christus Consolator (1836) was followed by Christus Remunerator, The shepherds led by the star (1837), The Magi laying down their crowns, Christ in the Garden of Olives, Christ bearing his Cross, Christ interred (1845), and St Augustine and Monica (1846). One of the reduced versions of his Christus Consolator (the prime version today to be found in the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam), lost for 70 years, was rediscovered in a janitor's closet in Gethsemane Lutheran Church in Dassel, Minnesota in 2007. It has been restored and is on display at the Minneapolis Institute of Art. Portrait of Katarzyna Potocka, 1850 (National Museum, Warsaw) Scheffer was also an accomplished portrait painter, finishing 500 portraits in total. His subjects included composers Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and Franz Liszt, the Marquis de la Fayette, Pierre-Jean de B√©ranger, Alphonse de Lamartine, Charles Dickens, Duchess de Broglie, Talleyrand and Queen Marie Am√©lie. After 1846, he ceased to exhibit. His strong ties with the royal family caused him to fall out of favour when, in 1848, the Second Republic came into being. Scheffer was made commander of the Legion of Honour in 1848, that is, after he had wholly withdrawn from the Salon. Shut up in his studio, he produced many paintings that were only exhibited after his death in 1858. The works first exhibited posthumously include Sorrows of the earth, and the Angel announcing the Resurrection, which he had left unfinished. By the time of his death, his reputation was damaged and was further undermined by the sale of the Paturle Gallery, which contained many of his most celebrated achievements: though his paintings were praised for their charm and facility, they were condemned for poor use of color and vapid sentiment. ==Friends and family== Jesus and Angel, between 1848 and 1858 Christ Weeping Over Jerusalem, 1851 At various times Maurice Sand, Scheffer, Charles Gounod, Hector Berlioz were in relationships with Pauline Viardot‚Äîin letters they claimed that they were in love with her.–ñ—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∑–∞–ª >> Author:–ò—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ –ß–ê–ô–ö–û–í–°–ö–ê–Ø \\"–ü–æ–ª–∏–Ω–∞ –í–∏–∞—Ä–¥–æ: –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –¥–∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å–∏–∏\\".

Specifically it is used to treat cellulitis, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, endocarditis, joint infection, and biliary tract infections. It is also used to prevent group B streptococcal disease around the time of delivery and before surgery. It is typically given by injection into a muscle or vein. Common side effects include diarrhea, vomiting, yeast infections, and allergic reactions. It is not recommended in people who have a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin. It is relatively safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Cefazolin is in the first-generation cephalosporin class of medication and works by interfering with the bacteria's cell wall. Cefazolin was patented in 1967 and came into commercial use in 1971. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication. ==Medical uses== Cefazolin is used in a variety of infections provided that susceptible organisms are involved. It is indicated for use in the following infections: * Respiratory tract infections * Urinary tract infections * Skin infections * Biliary tract infections * Bone and joint infections * Genital infections * Blood infections (sepsis) * Endocarditis It can also be used peri-operatively to prevent infections post-surgery, and is often the preferred drug for surgical prophylaxis. There is no penetration into the central nervous system and therefore cefazolin is not effective in treating meningitis. Cefazolin has been shown to be effective in treating methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) but does not work in cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In many instances of staphylococcal infections, such as bacteremia, cefazolin is an alternative to penicillin in patients who are allergic to penicillin. However, there is still potential for a reaction to occur with cefazolin and other cephalosporins in patients allergic to penicillin. Resistance to cefazolin is seen in several species of bacteria, such as Mycoplasma and Chlamydia, in which case different generations of cephalosporins may be more effective. Cefazolin does not fight against Enterococcus, anaerobic bacteria or atypical bacteria among others. === Bacterial susceptibility === As a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, cefazolin and other first-generation antibiotics are very active against gram- positive bacteria and some gram-negative bacteria. Their broad spectrum of activity can be attributed to their improved stability to many bacterial beta- lactamases compared to penicillins. === Spectrum of activity === Gram-positive aerobes: * Staphylococcus aureus (including beta-lactamase producing strains) * Staphylococcus epidermidis * Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and other strains of streptococci Gram- Negative Aerobes: * Escherichia coli * Proteus mirabilis === Non susceptible=== The following are not susceptible: * Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus * Enterococcus * most strains of indole positive Proteus (Proteus vulgaris) * Enterobacter spp. * Morganella morganii * Providencia rettgeri * Serratia spp. * Pseudomonas spp. * Listeria ==Special populations Pregnancy === Cefazolin is pregnancy category B, indicating general safety for use in pregnancy. Caution should be used in breastfeeding as a small amount of cefazolin enters the breast milk. Cefazolin can be used prophylactically against perinatal Group B streptococcal infection (GBS). Although penicillin and ampicillin are the standard of care for GBS prophylaxis, penicillin-allergic women with no history of anaphylaxis can be given cefazolin instead. These patients should be closely monitored as there is a small chance of an allergic reaction due to the similar structure of the antibiotics. === Newborns === There has been no established safety and effectiveness for use in premature infants and neonates. === Elderly === No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed in clinical trials comparing elderly and younger subjects, however the trials could not eliminate the possibility that some older individuals may have a higher level of sensitivity. ===Additional considerations=== People with kidney disease and those on hemodialysis may need the dose adjusted. Cefazolin levels are not significantly affected by liver disease. As with other antibiotics, cefazolin may interact with other medications being taken. Some important drugs that may interact with cefazolin such as probenecid. ==Side effects== Side effects associated with use of cefazolin therapy include: * Common (1-10%): diarrhea, stomach pain or upset stomach, vomiting, and rash. * Uncommon (<1%): dizziness, headache, fatigue, itching, transient hepatitis. Patients with penicillin allergies could experience a potential reaction to cefazolin and other cephalosporins. As with other antibiotics, patients experiencing watery and/or bloody stools occurring up to three months following therapy should contact their prescriber. Like those of several other cephalosporins, the chemical structure of cefazolin contains an N-methylthiodiazole (NMTD or 1-MTD) side-chain. As the antibiotic is broken down in the body, it releases free NMTD, which can cause hypoprothrombinemia (likely due to inhibition of the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase) and a reaction with ethanol similar to that produced by disulfiram (Antabuse), due to inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase. Those with an allergy to penicillin may develop a cross sensitivity to cefazolin. == Mechanism of action == Cefazolin inhibits cell wall biosynthesis by binding Penicillin binding proteins which stops peptidoglycan synthesis. Penicillin binding proteins are bacterial proteins that help to catalyze the last stages of peptidoglycan synthesis, which is needed to maintain the cell wall. They remove the D-alanine from the precursor of the peptidoglycan. The lack of synthesis causes the bacteria to lyse because they also continually break down their cell walls. Cefazolin is bactericidal, meaning it kills the bacteria rather than inhibiting their growth. ==Society and cultureCost=== Cefazolin is relatively inexpensive. ===Brand names=== It was initially marketed by GlaxoSmithKline under the trade name Ancef. Other trade names include: Cefacidal, Cefamezin, Cefrina, Elzogram, Faxilen, Gramaxin, Kefzol, Kefol, Kefzolan, Kezolin, Novaporin, Reflin, Zinol, and Zolicef. == References == == External links == * MedlinePlus Drug Information: Cefazolin Sodium Injection.

AIRMS is located in Simla. It works in liaison with RAW and Military intelligence. ==Aviation Research Centre == Cameras of MiG-25RB for aerial surveillance The Aviation Research Centre (ARC) is a part of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW;) of the Cabinet Secretariat (Special Requirements) India. The first head of the ARC was R. N. Kao, the founding chief of R&AW.; Over the years the ARC has grown into a large operation and flies a large and varied fleet. Aerial surveillance, SIGINT operations, photo reconnaissance flights (PHOTINT),NSNL 52 - Intelligence profile : India monitoring of borders, imagery intelligence (IMINT) are the main functions of the Aviation Research Centre (ARC). The aircraft are fitted with state-of-the-art electronic surveillance equipment and long range cameras capable of taking pictures of targets from very high altitudes. ARC also takes the responsibility along with the IAF to transport Special Frontier Force (SFF) commandos from their trans-location at Sarsawa, 250 km north of New Delhi, though the SFF's own base is in Chakrata in Uttarakhand (UK) state. ==Central Bureau of Investigation== The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is the premier investigating agency of India. It functions as a national investigating and security organization as well as an intelligence agency, and acts as India's liaison to Interpol. Operating under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, the CBI is headed by the Director who is an Indian Police Service officer of Director General Rank, CBI, who reports directly to the Prime Minister. The agency has been known to investigate several economic crimes, special crimes, cases of corruption and other high-profile cases. The CBI headquarters are located in New Delhi. ==Central Economic Intelligence Bureau== ==Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre (India)== ==Criminal Investigation Department (India)== Each state has own CID department reporting to the State Home Minister. == Directorate of Enforcement == The Enforcement Directorate is a law enforcement agency and economic intelligence agency responsible for enforcing economic laws and fighting economic crime in India. It is part of the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, Government of India. ==Department of Criminal Intelligence== ==Directorate of Air Intelligence== ==Directorate of Military Intelligence== ==Directorate of Naval Intelligence== ==Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation== The Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation is the law enforcement agency under the Ministry of Finance responsible for investigating violations of India's tax laws, including fraud, evasion and money laundering. It is tasked to, # To collect intelligence and information regarding aspects of the black economy which require close watch and investigation. Also, keeping in view the scene of economic offences, the Bureau is required to collect information and provide periodical and special reports to the concerned authorities; # To keep a watch on different aspects of economic offences and the emergence of new types of such offences. The Bureau was made responsible for evolving counter -measures required for effectively dealing with existing and new types of economic offences; # To act as the nodal agency for cooperation and coordination at the international level with other customs, drugs, law enforcement and other agencies in the area of economic offences. # To implementation of the COFEPOSA (i.e. Conservation of Foreign Exchange & Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1971 which provides for preventive detention of persons involved in smuggling and foreign exchange rackets under certain specified circumstances) # To act as a Secretariat of the Economic Intelligence Council which acts as the apex body to ensure full co-ordination among the various Agencies including Central Bureau of Investigation, Reserve Bank of India, Intelligence Bureau etc. # Head the investigation wing of the Income Tax Department at the Regional Level; # Collection of intelligence pertaining to evasion of Direct Taxes; # Organizing search action to unearth black money- from time to time; # Dissemination of information and intelligence collected- by passing on the same to the concerned authorities including assessing authorities; # Keep liaison and hold meetings with other organisations in the region to ensure co- ordination and smooth flow of information; # Take appropriate steps to ensure that information and other persons having information about tax evaders come forward with the same to the Department. Disbursement of rewards would be one of the measures. ==Defence Intelligence Agency== This agency was established on 5 March 2002 with the appointment of Lt. General Kamal Davar as the first Director General (DG). The DG reports to the Chief of Defence Staffs (CDS). It is supposed to be the nodal agency for all defence-related intelligence, thus distinguishing it from the RAW. Much of the agency's budget and operations are classified. DIA has control of MoD's prized technical intelligence assets ‚Äì the Directorate of Signals Intelligence and the Defence Image Processing and Analysis Centre (DIPAC). While the Signals Directorate is responsible for acquiring and decrypting enemy communications, the DIPAC controls India's satellite-based image acquisition capabilities. The DIA also controls the Defence Information Warfare Agency (DIWA) which handles all elements of the information warfare repertoire, including psychological operations, cyber-war, electronic intercepts and the monitoring of sound waves. ==Directorate of Income Tax (Intelligence and Criminal Investigation)== This is the Income Tax's intelligence arm. It is India's official FATF unit. The Directorate of Intelligence is an allied and compact investigative setup. The DGIT (Intelligence) reports directly to the Member (Investigation), Central Board of Direct Taxes. The office will be attached to the office of the Board. The Directorate is required to take up intensive investigation of selected cases / class of cases and develop them for further action / specialized operation; study and analyze emerging trends in tax evasion, new modus operandi etc.; create an economic offence database; develop a profiling system etc. both in traditional and non-traditional fields. The Directorate liaise/interact with other intelligence/investigating agencies such as FIU, NCB, ED, DRI, DGCEI, SFO, CEIB etc. The Directorate has access to all the information received by the Department viz. AIR, TDS, BCTT, STT, CIB, AST etc. Departmental national net work, Departmental records etc. The DGIT and his directorate are located at Delhi. They have an all India jurisdiction and are assigned concurrent powers with the other DG‚ÄôsIT (Inv.).Criminal Investigation (CI) investigates potential criminal violations of the Direct Tax Code and related financial crimes in a manner intended to foster confidence in the tax system and compliance with the law. While other federal agencies also have investigative jurisdiction for money laundering and some bank secrecy act violations, the Income Tax Department is the only federal agency that can investigate potential criminal violations of the Direct Tax Code. Criminal Investigation must investigate and assist in the prosecution of those significant financial investigations that will generate the maximum deterrent effect, enhance voluntary compliance, and promote public confidence in the tax system. Special agents and agents (ITO and Inspector rank) are allowed to carry firearms when they are posted in the Directorate of Criminal Investigation (DCI) in the IT department. The Finance Ministry has recently notified bringing under one umbrella the intelligence and criminal investigation units of the Income Tax department to effectively deal with terror financing cases and transactions that pose a threat to national security. The department will now recruit special agents and agents (criminal investigation) under the new wing, half of whom would be recruited or brought on deputation from premier investigative agencies and police organisations of the country. The special agents who will form part of the premier DCI would be able to carry firearms under the rules prescribed by their parent organisation and would be able to tackle any intimidation in course of their new duty of checking and gathering intelligence on tax evasion. The DCI is headed by the Director General of Intelligence (Income Tax) and was notified in May this year to tackle the menace of black money with cross-border ramifications.Tax evasion cases: I-T 'special agents' to carry arms Commissioners of the Intelligence directorate of Income Tax are posted in cities such as Delhi, Chandigarh, Jaipur, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata and Lucknow will also take up criminal investigation work under the DCI. ==Directorate of Revenue Intelligence== Functions with the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), in the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance.Directorate of Revenue Intelligence Its charter includes the functions of collection of intelligence about smuggling of contraband goods, narcotics, under-invoicing etc. through sources of India and abroad and to coordinate, direct and control anti-smuggling operations.Charter of the Organization ==Economic Intelligence Council== ==Indian Political Intelligence Office== ==Intelligence Bureau== The Intelligence Bureau (IB) is India's internal intelligence agency and reputedly the world's oldest intelligence agency. ==Investigation Division of the Central Board of Direct Taxes== ==Joint Cipher Bureau== The Joint Cipher Bureau works closely with the IB and RAW. It is responsible for cryptanalysis and encryption of sensitive data. The inter-services Joint Cipher Bureau has primary responsibility for cryptology and SIGINT, providing coordination and direction to the other military service organizations with a similar mission. Most current equipment providing tactical intelligence is of Russian origin, including specialized direction finding and monitoring equipment. The Joint Cipher Bureau is also responsible for issues relating to public and private key management. Cryptographic products are export-controlled licensed items, and licenses to India are not generally available for products of key length of more than 56 bits. The domestic Indian computer industry primarily produces PCs, and PC-compatible cryptographic products have been developed and are being used commercially. More robust encryption systems are not commercially produced in India, and progress in this field has been slow due to the general unavailability of technology and know-how. Customised cryptographic products have been designed and produced by organizations in the defence sector are engaged in the implementation of cryptographic techniques, protocols and the products. ==Narcotics Control Bureau== The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) is the chief law enforcement and intelligence agency of India responsible for fighting drug trafficking and the abuse of illegal substances. ==National Investigation Agency== National Investigation Agency (NIA) is a central agency established by the Indian Government to combat terror in India. It acts as the Central Counter Terrorism Law Enforcement Agency. The agency is empowered to deal with terror-related crimes across states without special permission from the states. The Agency came into existence with the enactment of the National Investigation Agency Act 2008 by the Parliament of India on 31 December 2008. ==National Technical Research Organisation== The National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) is a technical intelligence agency under the National Security Advisor in the Prime Minister's Office, India.

Although his work was published in the architectural press of his day, it was little appreciated outside Glasgow during his lifetime. It has only been since the 1950s and 1960s that his critical reputation has revived‚Äînot least of all in connection with his probable influence on Frank Lloyd Wright.Andrew MacMillan in \\"Greek\\" Thomson, Stamp et al., p.207 Henry-Russell Hitchcock wrote of Thomson in 1966: \\"Glasgow in the last 150 years has had two of the greatest architects of the Western world. C. R. Mackintosh was not highly productive but his influence in central Europe was comparable to such American architects as Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. An even greater and happily more productive architect, though one whose influence can only occasionally be traced in America in Milwaukee and in New York City and not at all as far as I know in Europe, was Alexander Thomson\\".Letter by Hitchcock published in the Glasgow Herald, 4 March 1966, on the occasion of the proposed demolition by the City council of the Caledonia Road Church ==Early life== Thomson was born in the village of Balfron in Stirlingshire. The son of John Thomson, a bookkeeper, and Elizabeth Cooper Thomson, he was the ninth of twelve children. His father, who already had eight grown children from his previous marriage, died when Alexander was seven. The family consequently moved to the outskirts of Glasgow, but tragedy struck when the eldest daughter, Jane, and three of her brothers died between 1828 and 1830, the year that Alexander's mother died. The remaining children moved with one of the older brothers, William, a teacher, and his wife and child to Hangingshaw, just south of Glasgow. The Thomson boys all worked from a young age, but the children were also home schooled. It is believed that Alexander worked in a lawyer's office, possibly Wilson, James, and Kays, where his older brother, Ebenezer, was employed as a bookkeeper and where he later became a partner in the business. ==Career== Alexander was eventually apprenticed to Glasgow architect Robert Foote, ultimately gaining a place in the office of John Baird as a draughtsman. In 1848 Thomson set up his own practice, Baird & Thomson, with John Baird II, who became his brother-in-law, and this firm lasted nine years. In 1857, as \\"the rising architectural star of Glasgow,\\"Stamp, Gavin. \\"At Once Classic and Picturesque...\\": Alexander Thomson's Holmwood. The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 57.1 (1998):46-58. he entered into practice with his brother George where he was to enjoy the most productive years of his life. He served as president of both the Glasgow Architectural Society and the Glasgow Institute of Architects. Thomson was an elder of the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland, and his deep religious convictions informed his work. There is a strong suggestion that he closely identified Solomon's Temple with the raised basilica of the same form of his three major churches.J. Stevens Curl, \\"St Vincent Street Church as a mnemonic of the Temple of Solomon\\", p.6 ff, The Alexander Thomson Society Newsletter, No. 12 January 1995. Caledonia Road Church, Glasgow He produced a diverse range of structures including villas, a castle, urbane terraces, commercial warehouses, tenements, and three extraordinary churches. Of these, Caledonia Road Free Church (1856‚Äì57) is now a ruin, Queen's Park United Presbyterian Church (1869) was destroyed in WWII, and St Vincent Street Church (1859) is the only intact survivor. Hitchcock once stated, \\"[Thomson has built] three of the finest Romantic Classical churches in the world‚Äù.H. R. Hitchcock, Architecture: Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, 1963, p.63 Thomson developed his own highly idiosyncratic style from Greek, Egyptian and Levantine sources and freely adapted them to the needs of the modern city. Thomson's Egyptian Halls on Union Street St. Vincent Street Free Church At the age of 34, Thomson designed his first and only castle, Craigrownie Castle, which stands at the tip of the Rosneath Peninsula in Cove, overlooking Loch Long. The six-storey structure is Scots Baronial in style, featuring a central tower with battlements, steep gables and oriel windows, in addition to a chapel and a mews cottage. Thomson's villa designs were realized at Langside, Pollokshields, Helensburgh, Cove, the Clyde Estuary, and on the Isle of Bute. His \\"mature villas are Grecian in style while resembling no other Greek Revival houses,...[and they] are dominated by horizontal lines and rest on a strong podium.\\"Stamp, Gavin. \\"At Once Classic and Picturesque...\\": Alexander Thomson's Holmwood. The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 57.1 (1998): 46. According to Gavin Stamp, \\"Thomson carefully designed his villas with symmetries within an overall asymmetry in a personal language in which the horizontal discipline of a continuous governing order‚Äîwhether expressed or implied‚Äîwas never abandoned. Regarding similarities to Frank Lloyd Wright, Stamp states, \\"It has often been remarked that there are clear resemblances between the early houses of the Prairie School and Thomson's horizontally massed design, with its low-pitched gables and spreading eaves -- together with a connecting garden.\\" As Sir John Summerson noted, \\"There is something wildly 'American' about Thomson -- a 'New World' attitude. You can see it in the villas...a sort of primitivism, ultra- Tuscan.\\" Caledonia Road Church, Glasgow Later in his career he would abandon his eclecticism and adopt the purely Ionic Greek style for which he is best known, as such he is perhaps the last in a continuous tradition of British Greek Revival architects. In attacking the Gothic, he \\"insisted that 'Stonehenge is really more scientifically constructed than York Minster'...[alluding to] Pugin's comment that in their temples 'the Greeks erected their columns like the uprights of Stonehenge'.\\"Stamp, Gavin. \\"At Once Classic and Picturesque...\\": Alexander Thomson's Holmwood. The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 57.1 (1998): 50. Other important works still standing include Moray Place, Great Western Terrace, Egyptian Halls in Union Street, Grosvenor Building, Buck's Head Building in Argyle Street, Grecian Buildings in Sauchiehall Street, Walmer and Millbrae Crescents, and his villa, Holmwood House, at Cathcart. Terraced houses on Millbrae Crescent in Langside, c. 1870Grave monuments designed by Thomson that are worthy of study include those to the Revd. A.O. Beattie and the Revd. G.M. Middleton, as well as that for John McIntyre in Cathcart Old Parish Cemetery. Thomson was a visionary who introduced into our vocabulary some of the essential elements of sustainable housing. This argument hinges on an unrealized design Thomson prepared in 1868 for the Glasgow City Improvement Trust, an agency of the Town Council given the task of redeveloping a large area of slum housing centred on the medieval Old Town. The Trust invited Thomson and five other prominent architects to propose designs for the reconstruction of various parcels of land along the spine of Glasgow's High Street. Thomson suggested that closely spaced parallel tenements be built within the central courtyard, the ends of which will be open to facilitate ventilation. He also proposed that alternate streets be glazed for better warmth and safety for the residents. Although Thomson's ideas failed to catch on at the time, new research and CAD techniques have helped show how revolutionary was his proposal for improved workers' housing. ==Writings== Thomson's published writings include the Haldane lectures on the history of architecture (1874) and the Inquiry as to the Appropriateness of the Gothic Style for the Proposed building for the University of Glasgow (1866) which attempted to refute Ruskin and Pugin‚Äôs claims for the superiority of Gothic. ==Family== On 21 September 1847, Thomson married Jane Nicholson, granddaughter of the architect Peter Nicholson, in a double wedding ceremony with her sister, Jessie, who married John Baird II. They had twelve children in total and would later lose five of them in an epidemic. One brother, George Thomson (1819‚Äì1878), became a baptist missionary in Limbe, Cameroon (then known as \\"Victoria\\"), where he combined his religious activities with a passion for botany. An epiphytic orchid of the genus Pachystoma was named Pachystoma thomsonianum in his honour. His nephew, Rev. William Cooper Thomson (1829-1878) was a missionary in Nigeria, after whose first wife the bleeding-heart vine Clerodendrum thomsoniae was named.Balfour, J.H. Description of a new species of Clerodendron... Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal n.s., 15(2): 233‚Äì235, t. 2. 1862. ==Death== Thomson died on 22 March 1875 at his home in Moray Place in Strathbungo, Glasgow, fittingly in one of his own creations. The architect was buried in the lair adjacent to that in which his five deceased children were laid to rest, in Gorbals Southern Necropolis, on 26 March 1875, and he was joined there by his widow, Jane, in 1889. His obituary appeared in \\"Building News\\" on 26 March 1875, written by his friend, Thomas Gildard, who also wrote his biography.Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Gildard ==Legacy== The Glasgow Institute of Architects set up The Alexander Thomson Memorial immediately following his death. A marble bust of the architect by John Mossman was presented to the Corporation Galleries, Sauchiehall Street, and is now displayed in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. The Alexander Thomson Travelling Studentship, of which the second winner was Charles Rennie Mackintosh, was established in his honor, \\"for the purpose of providing a travelling studentship for the furtherance of the study of ancient classic architecture, with special reference to the principles illustrated in Mr. Thomson‚Äôs works\\". Thomson was the pre-eminent architect of his era in Glasgow, yet until recently, his buildings and his reputation have been largely neglected in the city graced by his works. Holmwood House is generally considered to be Thomson's finest and most original residential subject. Under the ownership of the National Trust for Scotland, Holmwood has been restored to its original condition and opened to the general public. During the renovation, nineteen panels of a classical frieze depicting scenes from Homer's Iliad were discovered under layers of paint and wallpaper, rendering Thomson's nickname all the more apt. In 1999, a retrospective entitled Alexander Thomson: The Unknown Genius was held at The Lighthouse, reminding Glaswegians of the need to preserve the remaining examples of this unique architect's contribution to their city. The British emigre architect George Ashdown Audsley closely followed Thomson's ornamentation for several of his secular buildings. The most notable surviving example is his Bowling Green Offices (completed 1896) in New York City. The highly carved granite base of this tall office building is in the Thomson manner with brick Chicago School style floors above. ==Bibliography== *\\"Alexander Thomson: architectonics and ideals of the classic Glaswegian\\", John McKean, AA Files (Architectural Association, London), No 9, Summer 1985 *Dignity and Decadence, Richard Jenkyns, Harvard University Press, 1991. *\\"Greek\\" Thomson, Ed.

In 1799, his painting Marcus Sextus (Louvre) was exhibited at the Salon and excited wild enthusiasm. Part of this was due to the subject - a victim of Sulla's proscription returning to Rome to find his wife dead and his house in mourning - in which an allusion was found to the turmoil of the French Revolution. Morpheus and Iris, Hermitage Museum (1811) Gu√©rin on this occasion was publicly crowned by the president of the Institute, and went to Rome to study under Joseph-Beno√Æt Suv√©e. In 1800, unable to remain in Rome on account of his health, he went to Naples, where he painted The Shepherds in the Tomb of Amyntas . In 1802 Gu√©rin produced Phaedra and Hippolytus (Louvre); in 1810, after his return to Paris, he again achieved a great success with Andromache and Pyrrhus (Louvre); and in the same year also exhibited Aurora and Cephalus (Louvre) and Bonaparte and the Rebels of Cairo (Versailles). These paintings suited the popular taste of the First Empire, being highly melodramatic and pompously dignified. The Restoration brought to Gu√©rin fresh honours; he had received from the first consul in 1803 the cross of the Legion of Honour, and in 1815 Louis XVIII named to the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. His style changed to accord with popular taste. In Aeneas Relating to Dido the Disasters of Troy (Louvre), Gu√©rin adopted a more sensuous, picturesque style. Aeneas tells Dido about the fall of Troy, 1815. Gu√©rin was commissioned to paint for the Madeleine a scene from the history of St Louis, but his health prevented him from accomplishing what he had begun, and in 1822 he accepted the post of director of the French Academy in Rome, which in 1816 he had refused. On returning to Paris in 1828, Gu√©rin, who had previously been made chevalier of the order of St. Michel, was ennobled. He now attempted to complete Pyrrhus and Priam, a work which he had begun at Rome, but in vain; his health had finally broken down, and in the hope of improvement he returned to Italy with Horace Vernet. Shortly after his arrival at Rome Baron Gu√©rin died, on 6 July 1833, and was buried in the church of La Trinit√© de Monti by the side of Claude Lorrain. A heroic portrait by Guerin hangs in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Baltimore. An 1821 gift of King Louis XVIII of France, it depicts the Descent from the Cross. ==Pupils== Many artists studied with Gu√©rin, among them Eug√®ne Delacroix, Th√©odore G√©ricault, Ary and Hendrik Scheffer.Fr√©d√©ric Chappey, Les Professeurs des Beaux-Arts (1794-1873), dans : Romantisme, 1996.

The Red Guardian is an identity that was created as the Soviet equivalent of Captain America, although its use has continued after the fall of the Soviet Union. David Harbour will portray the Alexei Shostakov incarnation of Red Guardian in the 2021 film Black Widow set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. ==Aleksey Lebedev== Aleksey Lebedev (Russian: –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π –õ–µ–±–µ–¥–µ–≤), the Golden Age version of Red Guardian, first appeared in Namor, The Sub-Mariner Annual #1 (June 1991), created by writers Dana Moreshead and Mike Thomas, and artist Phil Hester. Very little is known of him, but he fought alongside Captain America (William Naslund) and the Sub-Mariner at the Potsdam Conference, in July, 1945. He began his career during World War II and met the All-Winners Squad (formerly the Invaders) on only one recorded occasion, clashing with them shortly after the war's end, where he taunted Captain America (secretly the Patriot) that he was 'slowing down' after he was able to catch Captain America's shield.Captain America: Patriot #2 Like the other crusaders of the same name, he was created as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America. He was later apparently killed during the purges of the 1950s, opposing the brutal experiments that would later create his successor.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update 2010 #4 ==Alexei Shostakov== Alexei Alanovich Shostakov was the second version of Red Guardian, and was created by Roy Thomas and John Buscema. Alexei Shostakov was born in Moscow, and was the husband of Natasha Romanova. Both he and his wife became agents of the Soviets: the latter as the Black Widow while the former became a test pilot and KGB agent and then trained as a Soviet counterpart to Captain America as the \\"Red Guardian\\". Alexei Shostakov was one of the Soviet Union's most acclaimed pilots. During World War II on the Eastern Front, he shot down a large number of Luftwaffe fighter planes in aerial battles and was credited for helping the Soviet Air Force win air supremacy over the skies of Stalingrad and Kursk. Because of his extraordinary skill, Shostakov was chosen for the most secret and dangerous tests and new aircraft for the Soviet Union. This included being the first pilot to test fly the MiG-15. The Soviet state controlled news media greatly publicized this and certain other missions of his such as his aerial battles against the U.S. Air Force over MiG Alley during the Korean War. As a result, Shostakov was decorated as a hero of the Soviet Union. Shostakov was also successful in his private life, having married the equally famous ballerina Natalie (familiarly known as Natasha) Romanova. As the Cold War flared up in the 1950s, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev realized that the Soviet Union needed its own equivalent to Captain America. Khrushchev chose Alexi Shostakov over Yuri Gagarin who would later become the first man in space. The KGB faked his death and trained him in secret, keeping his survival a secret from Natasha. He became a master of hand-to-hand combat and a highly skilled athlete. In addition, he carried a throwing disc on his belt which could be used against an opponent. Magnetic force returned the disc after throwing. The disc had the yellow hammer and sickle symbol on it and his costume was red with a star on his chest to symbolise the Soviet flag. While the Black Widow became disillusioned with KGB masters and defected to the United States, the Red Guardian remained loyal and became more ruthless and vindictive. The Red Guardian battled the Avengers with his Chinese ally Colonel Ling, to protect a Communist Chinese secret weapon located at a secret military base at an unrevealed location in the People's Republic of China, encountering the Black Widow and Captain America (Steve Rogers). When the Black Widow noticed \\"something familiar\\" about him, Red Guardian revealed his identity.

Arts refer to paintings, architecture, literature, music, dance, languages and cinema. In early India, most of the arts were derived Vedic influences. After the birth of contemporary Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism arts flourished under the patronage of kings and emperors. The coming of Islam spawned a whole new era of Indian architecture and art. Finally the British brought their own Gothic and Roman influences and fused it with the Indian style. They have a culture infusion in their art. ==Architecture== The Taj Mahal in Agra is widely considered to be the best example of Indo-Islamic architecture and is one of the most well-known monuments in the world. The earliest production in the Indus Valley Civilization was characterised by cities and houses where religion did not seem to play an active role. The Buddhist period is primarily represented by three important building types- the Chaitya Hall (place of worship), the Vihara (monastery) and the Stupa (hemispherical mound for worship/ memory) - exemplified by the caves of Ajanta and Ellora and the monumental Sanchi Stupa. The Jaina temples are characterised by high levels of detail that can be seen in the Dilwara Temples in Mt. Abu. Early beginnings of Hindu temple architecture have been traced to the remains at Aihole and Pattadakal in present-day Karnataka, and have Vedic altars and late Vedic temples as described by PƒÅ·πáini as models. Later, as more differentiation took place, the Dravidian/ Southern style and or the Indo-Aryan/ Northern/ Nagara style of temple architecture emerged as dominant modes, epitomized in productions such as the Brihadeeswara Temple, Thanjavur, and the Sun Temple, Konark. With the arrival of Islam, a new style of architecture known as Indo- Islamic architecture emerged combining traditional Indian and Islamic elements. The earliest examples include the Qutb complex, a series of monuments built by successive sultans of the Delhi Sultanate. The architecture of the Mughal Empire includes the Red Fort, Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, Humayun's tomb, Jama Masjid and Fatehpur Sikri. With colonization, a new chapter began. Though the Dutch, Portuguese and the French were influencers, it was the English who had a lasting impact. The architecture of the colonial period varied from the beginning attempts at creating authority through classical prototypes to the later approach of producing a supposedly more responsive image through what is now termed Indo-Saracenic architecture- a mixture of Hindu, Islamic and Western elements. With the introduction of Modern Architecture into India and later with Independence, the quest was more towards progress as a paradigm fuelled by Nehruvian visions. The planning of Chandigarh- a city most architects hate/love- by Le Corbusier was considered a step towards this. Later as modernism became less popular in the West and new directions were sought for, there was a movement in India toward architecture rooted in the Indian context. This direction called Critical Regionalism is exemplified in the works of architects such as B. V. Doshi, Charles Correa, etc. Apart from this, the advent of globalisation and economic development since the 90s, has spawned a collection of modern IT campuses and skyscrapers, and as economic reform accelerates, metropolitan areas are gaining futuristic skylines. ;Various examples of Indian architecture Image:Madurai-tank.jpg Typical South Indian temple gopuram (temple gate) built almost a millennium ago, but as tall as a modern mid-rise. Image:victoria-kolkata.jpgVictoria Memorial, a specimen of British Indian architecture, which incorporated European gothic, Persian saracenic and traditional Indian architecture. Image:Ellora cave16 003.jpg The massive Ellora Hindu and Buddhist temples were not constructed, but in fact carved out of solid rock from the top to the bottom. Image:Sanchi2.jpgThe Great Buddhist Stupa at Sanchi is the oldest existing structure in India, aside from the Indus Valley civilization ruins, and a World Heritage Site. Image:Amritsar-golden-temple-00.JPGThe Harimandir Sahib, known popularly as the Golden Temple, is a sacred shrine for Sikhs. Image:Bombay-Stock-Exchange.jpgPhiroze Jeejeebhoy Towers, location of the Bombay Stock Exchange is an example of 1980s Indian architecture. ==Literature== Rabindranath Tagore won the Nobel prize for literature. It is the first Nobel prize won by Asia. Indian literature is generally acknowledged, but not wholly established, as the oldest in the world. India has 22 officially recognized languages, and a huge variety of literature has been produced in these languages over the years. In Indian literature, oral and written forms are both important. Hindu literary traditions dominate a large part of Indian culture. Apart from the Vedas which are a sacred form of knowledge, there are other works such as the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, treatises such as Vaastu Shastra in architecture and town planning, and Arthashastra in political science. Devotional Hindu drama, poetry and songs span the subcontinent. Among the best known are the works of Kalidasa (writer of the famed Sanskrit play Shakuntala) and Tulsidas (who wrote an epic Hindi poem based on the Ramayana, called Raamcharitmaanas). Tamil literature has been in existence for more than 2500 years. Tolkaappiyam has been credited as its oldest work, whereas the exact origins of Thirukkural is unknown. The golden age of Tamil literature was during the Sangam period, roughly 1800 years ago. The classic works of this period are Cilappatikaram, Manimekalai, and Sivakasinthamani. Tamil literature is known for its secular traditions, although its authors had strong religious beliefs. Thirukkural is considered to be the greatest of Tamil works. Kannada literature is probably the third oldest in Indian literature next to Sanskrit literature and Tamil literature. The earliest reported work in Kannada literature dates back to the fifth century. The first available literary in Kannada is Kavirajamarga, written in the eighth century by Amoghavarsha Nrpatunga. Hindi literature started as religious and philosophical poetry in medieval periods in dialects like Avadhi and Brij. The most famous figures from this period are Kabir and Tulsidas. In modern times, the Khadi dialect became more prominent and a variety of literature was produced in Sanskrit. The most renowned Bengali writer is Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, who received the Nobel Prize for Literature. In the last century, several Indian writers have distinguished themselves not only in traditional Indian languages but also in English. India's only native-born Nobel laureate in literature was the Bengali writer Rabindranath Tagore, but VS Naipaul, a diaspora Indian novelist born in Trinidad, also won the Nobel in 2001. Other major writers who are either Indian or of Indian origin and derive much inspiration from Indian themes are R. K. Narayan, Vikram Seth, Salman Rushdie, Arundhati Roy, Raja Rao, Amitav Ghosh, Vikram Chandra, Mukul Kesavan, Shashi Tharoor, Nayantara Sehgal, Anita Desai, Ashok Banker, Shashi Deshpande, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Bharati Mukherjee. ==Music== Indian music includes multiple varieties of folk, popular, pop, and classical music. India's classical music tradition, including Carnatic and Hindustani music, has a history spanning millennia and, developed over several eras, remains fundamental to the lives of Indians today as sources of religious inspiration, cultural expression and pure entertainment. India is made up of several dozen ethnic groups, speaking their own languages and dialects. Alongside distinctly subcontinental forms there are major influences from Persian, Arab and British music. Indian genres like filmi and bhangra have become popular throughout the United Kingdom, South and East Asia, and around the world. Indian stars now sell records in many countries, while world music fans listen to the roots music of India's diverse nations. American soul, rock and hip hop music have also made a large impact, primarily on Indian pop and filmi music. Other highly popular forms are ghazal, qawwali, thumri, dhrupad, dadra, bhajan, kirtan, shabad, and gurbani. Filmi music is often said to have begun in 1931, with the release of Ardeshir M. Irani's Alam Ara and its popular soundtrack. In the earliest years of the Indian cinema, filming was generally Indian (classical and folk) in inspiration, with some Western elements. Over the years, the Western elements have increased, but without completely destroying the Indian flavour. Most of the Indian movies are musicals and feature elaborate song and dance numbers. There is constant work for pop music composers ‚Äî or music directors, to use the Indian term. Movie soundtracks are released as tapes and CDs, sometimes even before the movie is released. ==Dance== Indian classical dance is performed in different styles. Its theory can be traced back to the Natya Shastra of Bharata Muni, a sage from Tamil Nadu (400 BC). The Natya Shastra is the most important ancient treatise on classical Indian dance. It is also called the fifth Veda in reference to the foundation of Hindu religion and philosophy, from which sprang the related South Indian musical tradition of Carnatic music. Its various current forms include Bharatanatyam, Odissi, Manipuri, Kathakali, Kuchipudi, Mohiniaattam, Kathak and Sattriya. Bharatanatyam is a classical dance form originating in Tamil Nadu. It is thought to have been created by Bharata Muni. In ancient times Bharatanatyam was performed by mandir (Hindu temple) Devadasis. Many of the ancient sculptures in Hindu temples are based on Bharatanatyam dance postures karanas. Odissi is one of the oldest surviving forms of dance, with depictions of Odissi dancing dating back as far as the 1st century BC. Like other forms of Indian classical dance, the Odissi style traces its origins back to antiquity. Dancers are found depicted in bas-relief in the hills of Udaygiri (near Bhubaneswar) dating back to the 1st century BC. The Natya Shastra speaks of the dance from this region and refers to it as Odra-Magadhi. Kathakali (katha for story, kali for performance or play) is a form of dance-drama. It originated in the South Indian state of Kerala over 500 years ago. It is a spectacular combination of drama, dance, music and ritual. Characters with vividly painted faces and elaborate costumes re-enact stories from the Hindu epics, Mahabharata and Ramayana. Kuchipudi is a classical dance form from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, a state of South India. Kuchipudi is the name of a small village in the Divi Taluq of Krishna district that borders the Bay of Bengal and with resident Brahmins practising this traditional dance form, it acquired the present name. Mohiniaattam is a traditional dance from the South Indian state of Kerala. Mohini is an Apsaras in the Hindu mythology and aattam in Malayalam means dance. So Mohiniaattam essentially means \\"dance of the enchantress\\". The theme of Mohiniaattam is love and devotion to god. The costume worn by the dancers are typically white coloured kasavu saree with golden borders. The Kathak dance form arose from the Vaishnava devotees dancing to the episodes from Krishna's life. Originally a Northern Indian temple dance, it was transformed to a court dance in the Mughal era. The new Muslim influence brought with it certain changes to the dance form: what had been a largely devotional practice now became more a courtly entertainment. The Sattriya dance is believed to be a creation of the great Vaishnavite (bhakti) guru Srimanta Sankardeva considered the lead architect of Assamese literature and culture. He created this magnificent Sattriya dance to accompany the Ankiya Naat (a form of Assamese one-act play, another creation of Sankardeva) which was usually performed in Satras (Assamese monasteries). Since the dance developed and grew within the Satras, it is named after these religious institutions. Folk dances are performed for every possible occasion, to celebrate the arrival of seasons, birth of a child, a wedding and festivals. The dances are very focused on gestures, postures, and expressions. The dances burst with verve and vitality. Men and women perform some dances exclusively, while in some performances men and women dance together. On most occasions artists sing the main lyrics and are accompanied by instruments. Each form of dance has a specific costume. Most costumes are flamboyant with extensive jewels. Bhangra is a form of music and dance that originated in the Punjab region of India. Bhangra dance began as a folk dance conducted by Punjabi farmers to celebrate the coming of Vaisakhi, a sikh festival. The specific moves reflect the manner in which villagers farmed their land. This musical art further became synthesized after the partition of India, when refugees from different parts of the Punjab shared their folk dances with individuals who resided in the regions they settled in. This hybrid dance became Bhangra. The dance started from just one move and evolved later on. It has been popularized by Punjabi artists from the Sikh communities, with which it is now commonly associated.[1] Today, Bhangra dance survives in different forms and styles all over the globe ‚Äì including pop music, film soundtracks, collegiate competitions and even talent shows. Thirayattam is a ritual performing dance of south malabar region (kozhikode and malappuram Dt:) in Kerala state. In Malayalam language, the word \\"Thirayattam\\" refers to a 'colourful dance' This vibrant Ethnic art form blend of dance, instrumental music, drama, facial and body makeup, martial art and ritualistic Function. Thirayattam enacted in courtyards of sacred groves and village shrines, during Thirayattam festival.\\"Thirayattam\\" ( Folklore Text- malayalam, Moorkkanad peethambaran),State Institute of language, Kerala. == Sculpture == First sculptures in India date back to the Indus Valley civilization, where stone and bronze carvings have been discovered. This is one of the earliest instances of sculpture in the world. Later, as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism developed further, India produced some of the most intricate bronzes in the world, as well as unriveled temple carvings. Some huge shrines, such as the one at Ellora were not actually constructed using blocks, but instead carved out of solid rock, making them perhaps the largest and most intricate sculptures in the world. During the 2nd to 1st century BCE in far northern India, in what is now southern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha's life and teachings. Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form before this time, but only through some of his symbols. This may be because Gandharan Buddhist sculpture in modern Afghanistan displays Greek and Persian artistic influence. Artistically, the Gandharan school of sculpture is said to have contributed wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, acanthus leaf decorations, etc. The pink sandstone sculptures of Mathura evolved during the Gupta period (4th to 6th century) to reach a very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. Newer sculptures in Afghanistan, in stucco, schist or clay, display very strong blending of Indian post-Gupta mannerism and Classical influence, Hellenistic or possibly even Greco-Roman. Meanwhile, elsewhere in India, less anatomically accurate styles of human representation evolved, leading to the classical art that the world is now familiar with, and contributing to Buddhist and Hindu sculpture throughout Asia.

Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of Ellora, Maharashtra state present an example of Indian paintings, and the colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals. Thereafter, frescoes of Ajanta and Ellora caves appeared. India's Buddhist literature is replete with examples of texts which describe that palaces of kings and aristocratic class were embellished with paintings, but they have not survived. But, it is believed that some form of art painting was practiced in that time. Indian Art was given a new lease of life by the British in early 19th century when the new government required painters to document Indian life and times. The English School paintings, as these new art were called had seen the emergence of India's greatest artists of all times Raja Ravi Verma. Other important artists of the Colonial period include Jamini Roy, Amrita Shergil, Ramkinker Baij and Rabindranath Tagore. After independence, Indian art became more diverse and artists like Maqbool Fida Hussain, Francis Newton Souza, Subodh Gupta, Devajyoti Ray, Sudip Roy, Paresh Maity and Bose Krishnamachari earned international recognition. ;Indian art, ancient and medieval Image:Indischer Maler um 1650 (I) 001.jpg Image:Meister des Rasikapriy√¢-Manuskripts 002.jpg Image:Daudia 001.jpg Image:Indischer_Maler_des_6._Jahrhunderts_001.jpg ==Cinema== India is a major regional center for cinema. The Indian film industry is the second largest in the world (1200 movies released in the year 2002). Each of the larger jrods supports its own film industry: Hindi, Bengali, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Odia. The Hindi/Urdu film industry, based in Mumbai, formerly Bombay, is called Bollywood (a melding of Hollywood and Bombay). Similar neologisms have been coined for the Kannada (Karnataka State) film industry (Sandalwood) based on Karnataka being known for Sandalwood, Tamil film industry (Kollywood, from the Kodambakkam district of Chennai) and the Telugu film industry (Tollywood). Tollygunge is a metonym for the Bengali film industry, long centered in the Tollygunge district of Kolkata. The Bengali language industry is notable as including the director Satyajit Ray, an international filmmaker and a winner of many awards, among them the Bharat Ratna (India's highest civilian award), the L√©gion d'honneur (France), and the Lifetime achievement Academy Award. Odia film industry is known as Ollywood and it has a history of film making since 1936. The Bollywood industry is usually the largest in terms of films produced and box office receipts, just as Urdu/Hindi speakers outnumber speakers of other Indian languages within India. == Radio == Radio broadcasting was, until recently a government monopoly under the Directorate General of All India Radio‚Äîestablished in 1936 and since 1957 also known as Akashvani‚Äîa government-owned, semicommercial operation of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. From only six stations at the time of independence, All India Radio's network had expanded by the mid-1990s to 146 AM stations plus a National Channel, the Integrated North-East Service (aimed at tribal groups in northeast India), and the External Service. There are five regional headquarters for All India Radio: the North Zone in New Delhi; the North-East Zone in Guwahati, Assam; the East Zone in Calcutta; the West Zone in Bombay; and the South Zone in Madras. All India Radio covers 99.37% of India's populace. The government-owned network provides both national and local programs in Hindi, English, and sixteen regional languages. Commercial services, which were inaugurated in 1957, are provided by Vividh Bharati Service, headquartered in Mumbai. Vividh Bharati, which accepts advertisements, broadcasts from thirty-one AM and FM stations in the mid-1990s. India has an extensive network of medium wave and shortwave stations. In 1994 there were eighty-five FM stations and seventy-three shortwave stations that covered the entire country. The broadcasting equipment is mostly Indian made and reaches special audiences, such as farmers needing agroclimatic, plant protection, and other agriculture-related information. The number of radio receivers increased almost fivefold between 1970 and 1994, from around 14 million to nearly 65 million. Most radios are also produced within India. The foreign broadcast service is a function of the External Services Division of All India Radio. In 1994 seventy hours of news, features, and entertainment programs were broadcast daily in twenty-five languages using thirty-two shortwave transmitters. The principal target audiences are listeners in neighbouring countries and the large overseas Indian community. Satellite Radio was introduced to the Indian market in 2000 by WorldSpace, a Washington-DC based company. Currently WorldSpace beams 30 channels comprising music, news, and regional channels, a subscriber in India pays 1,200 per annum. In addition, some premium channels are available at an extra cost. This service requires special receivers which are often subsidized by world space. Recently The Department of Space (DoS) indicated it is exploring the possibility of setting up a multi-media satellite platform that would include satellite radio, video and data channels. == Television == Television service is available throughout the country. Doordarshan is a government-owned broadcaster established in 1959 and a part of All India Radio until 1976. It operates of one national network and seven regional networks. In 1992 there were sixty-three high-power television transmitters, 369 medium-power transmitters, seventy-six low-power transmitters, and twenty-three transposers. Regular satellite transmissions began in 1982 (the same year colour transmission began). By 1994 some 6 million people were receiving television broadcasts via satellite, and the number was expected to increase rapidly throughout the rest of the decade. Cable television was even more prolific, with an estimated 12 to 15 million subscribers in 1994. Besides Doordarshan, Zee TV‚Äîan independent station broadcasting from Mumbai since 1992‚Äîuses satellite transmissions. In fact, because Doordarshan is the only network that is permitted to broadcast television signals domestically, Zee TV and other entrepreneurs broadcast their Indian-made videotapes via foreign transmitters. Other networks joining the fray are Cable News Network (1990); Asia Television Network (1991); Hong Kong-based Star TV (1991); Jain TV, near Bombay (1994); EL TV, a spin-off of Zee TV in Bombay (1994); HTV, an affiliate of the Hindustan Times in New Delhi (1994); and Sun TV, a Tamil language service in Chennai (1994). In a communications breakthrough in July 1995, Doordarshan agreed, for a US$1.5 million annual fee and 50 percent of advertising revenue when it exceeds US$1.5 million, to allow CNN to broadcast twenty-four hours a day via an Indian satellite. regional, and local service. The number of television sets increased from around 500,000 in 1976 to 9 million in early 1987 and to around 47 million in 1994; increases are expected to continue at around 6 million sets per year.

Part of a group of successful Norwegian athletes, he won his first international medal only two years later, placing second at the 1994 European Championships . By finishing third in the final of the 1995 World Championships, he established himself as one of the top 800 m runners in the world, and was among the medal contenders for the 1996 Summer Olympics, held in Atlanta. Not present at the Olympics was world champion Wilson Kipketer, who had emigrated from Kenya to Denmark, but wasn't allowed to run for his new country by the Kenyans. This made the final wide open. Rodal made the final, which was run in a blistering pace. Rodal overtook most of the field in his second lap, and took the lead at the last bend, crossing the line first in a new Olympic record of 1:42.58, which stood until the 2012 Summer Olympics. With four runners under 1:43, the final was one of the fastest 800 m ever run. The Olympic title would remain Rodal's only international victory. He failed to make the final of the Sydney Olympics in 2000, finishing seventh in his semi-final.

Apollo was the main deity of the sanctuary of Didyma, also called Didymaion. But it was home to both of the temples dedicated to the twins Apollo and Artemis. Other deities were also honoured within the sanctuary. The Didymaion was well renowned in antiquity because of its famed oracle. This oracle of Apollo was situated within what was, and is, the one of the world's greatest temples to Apollo. The remains of this Hellenistic temple belong to the best preserved temples of classical antiquity. Besides this temple other buildings existed within the sanctuary which have been rediscovered recently; a Greek theatre and the foundations of the above-mentioned Hellenistic temple of Artemis, to name but two. ==Geography== Map of the area around ancient Didyma The ruins of Didyma are located a short distance to the northwest of modern Didim in Aydin Province, Turkey, whose name is derived from the ruins. It sits on a headland that in antiquity formed the Milesian Peninsula. Didyma was the largest and most significant sanctuary on the territory of the great classical city Miletus. The natural connection between Miletus and Didyma was by way of ship. But during antiquity the sediments from the Meander River silted up the harbour of Miletus. A slow process which eventually meant that the nearby Latmian Gulf developed from a bay into a lake (today Bafa G√∂l√º). The linear distance between Miletus and Didyma measures some 16 km. As well as the simple footway there also existed a Sacred Way between the city and its sanctuary which measured some 20 km in distance. This Sacred Way, built in the 6th century BC, was used for festival processions.Tuchelt, K. (1991). Branchidai-Didyma, p. 38-39. It touched the harbour of Didyma, situated 3 km northwest of the sanctuary called PanormosThe archaeological research project of Panormos (today Mavi≈üehir). Along this route were ritual waystations, and statues of noblemen and noblewomen, as well as animal and mythological beast figures. Some of these statues, dating to the 6th century BC, are now in the British Museum (Room 13), excavated by the British archaeologist Charles Thomas Newton in the 19th century.British Museum Collection Bust of a marble kouros from the Sacred Way at Didyma, now in the British Museum, 550 BCBritish Museum Highlights The lighthouse and the remains of the altar of Poseidon The Milesians erected an altar dedicated to Poseidon 6 km southwest of Didyma. The altar was built in the first half of the 6th century BC at the southwest cape of the Milesian Peninsula. Here was the border between Ionia and Caria (according to StraboStrabo, Geographica 14.1.5.). The remains of the altar are still visible and can be easily found due to the location of a nearby modern lighthouse. Architectural members of this famous altar can be seen in the Pergamon Museum of Berlin. ==Names== In Greek didyma means \\"twin\\", but the Greeks who sought a \\"twin\\" at Didyma ignored the Carian origin of the name. The Carians settled this area before the Ionian Greeks. Didyma was first mentioned among the Greeks in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo. But its establishment is supposed to precede literacy and even the Hellenic colonization of Ionia around 1000 BC. In contrary the first archaeological pieces of evidence of Didyma date in the 8th century BC.Tuchelt, K. (1991). Branchidai-Didyma, p. 9-10. Mythic genealogies of the origins of the Branchidae line of priests, designed to capture the origins of Didyma as a Hellenic tradition, date to the Hellenistic period. Greek and Roman authors laboured to refer the name Didyma to \\"twin\\" temples or to temples of the twins Apollo and Artemis, whose own cult center at Didyma had then only recently been established. Also, as Wilamowitz suggested, there may be a connection to Cybele Dindymene, the \\"Cybele of Mount Dindymon\\". Excavations by German archaeologists have lately uncovered the temple dedicated to Artemis, north of the temple of Apollo. Apollo was worshipped in nearby Miletus under the name Delphinius (the same name was also used at Delphi). At Didyma, he was worshipped as Didymeus (ŒîŒπŒ¥œÖŒºŒµœÖœÇ). His other names in the area were Philesios, and Carinus (ŒöŒ±œÅŒπŒΩŒøœÇ).APOLLON TITLES theoi.com ==History== A map of the main sanctuaries in Classical Greece The temple of Apollo southwards. A bull figure from the site. It is supposed that until its destruction by the Persians in 494 BC, Didyma's sanctuary was administered by the family of the Branchidae, who claimed descent from an eponymous Branchos (Carian: êä∑êä†êä•êãÑêä† par≈ãa), a youth beloved of Apollo.Strabo, Geographica, 14.1.5. The priestess, seated above the sacred spring, gave utterances that were interpreted by the Branchidae. Both HerodotusHerodotus, Histories, 1.157.3. and PausaniasPausanias, Description of Greece, 7.2.6. dated the origins of the oracle at Didyma before the Ionian colonization of this coast. Clement of Alexandria quotes Leandrios saying that Cleochus, grandfather of the eponymous founder Miletus, was buried within the temple enclosure of Didyma.Clement Alexandrinus, Protrepticus, 3.45.2-3. Under the Persian king Darius, following the naval battle of Lade, the sanctuary was burned in 494 BC. The Persians carried away the bronze cult statue of Apollo to Ecbatana, traditionally attributed to Canachus of SicyonPausanias, Description of Greece, 2.10.5. at the end in the 6th century BC. It was then reported that the oracle spring ceased to flow and the archaic oracle was silenced.Parke reports that the adyton is normally dry today. Although the sanctuaries of Delphi and Ephesus were swiftly rebuilt, Didyma remained a ruin until the time Alexander the Great conquered Miletus and freed it from the Persians in 334 BC. In between a complete break had been rent in the oracles' personnel and tradition, the Branchidae priests marched off to Persian sovereign territory. Callisthenes, a court historian of Alexander, reported that the spring began once more to flow as Alexander passed through Egypt in 331 BC.see Strabo, Geographica 17,1,43. After the liberation from the Persians the Milesians began to build a new temple for Apollo, which was the largest in the Hellenic world after the temple of Hera on the Isle of Samos and the temple of Artemis at Ephesus. Vitruvius recorded a tradition that the architects were Paeonius of Ephesus, whom Vitruvius credited with the rebuilding of the Temple of Artemis there, and Daphnis of Miletus.Vitruvius, De architectura, 7 praef. 16. The dipteral temple of Apollo was surrounded by a double file of Ionic columns. From the pronaos lead two tunnels to the inner court. This was the location of the oracle spring, the sacred laurel tree and the naiskos - which was itself a small temple. It contained in its own small cella the bronze cult image of Apollo, brought back by Seleucus I Nicator from Persia about 300 BC.Pausanias, Description of Greece, 8.46.3. In the Hellenistic period, beside Alexander, the kings Seleucus I and Seleucus II received oracles. So in the 3rd century BC the sanctuary of Apollo stood under the influence of the Seleucids, offering very rich donations to Apollo. Didyma suffered a serious setback in 277/76 BC, as Galatians looted it, coming from the Balkans to Asia Minor. Pliny reportedPliny the Elder, The Natural History, 6.18. the worship of Apollo Didymiae, Apollo of Didymus, in Central Asia, transported to Sogdiana by a general of Seleucus I and Antiochus I whose inscribed altars there were still to be seen by Pliny's correspondents. Corroborating inscriptions on amphoras were found by I. R. Pichikyan at Dilbergin. Afterwards the kings of Bithynia made donations to the Didymaion in the 2nd century BC and the Ptolemaic kings of Egypt in the first half of 1st century BC. The annual festival held in Didyma under the auspices of Miletus were called the Didymeia. They are first mentioned at the beginning 3rd century BC. A hundred years later they were made a Panhellenic (open to all Greeks) and a penteteric festival (they took place every four years). In the first half of the 1st century BC the Didymeia were banned because Miletus had supported Mithridates, in his war against the Romans. Furthermore, the sanctuary of Apollo was looted by pirates in 67 BC. After Pompey had reorganized the East of the Roman Empire, the Didymeia were permitted again in 63 BC. Some years later Gaius Iulius Caesar expanded the area under asylum in Didyma. Apparently the Roman emperor Caligula tried to complete the huge temple of Apollo. Emperor Trajan renewed the Sacred Way between Miletus and Didyma as inscriptions prove in 101 AD. His successor Hadrian visited Miletus and Didyma in 129 AD and acted as Prophet - the highest office in the sanctuary. Under Commodus the Didymeia were held as the Commodeia for the cult of the emperor. In Hellenistic and Roman times the sanctuary of Apollo flourished again. Numerous oracles of Apollo were imparted, some of them are extant in Roman inscriptions. These included inquiries and responses, and literary testimony records Didyma's role as an oracle, with the \\"grim epilogue\\"Robert Parker, reviewing Fontenrose 1988 in The Classical Review New Series 39.2 (1989), p 270. of Apollo's supposed sanction of Diocletian's persecution of Christians, until the closing of the temples under Theodosius I. This was the end of the oracle. In Late Antiquity Didyma had been the seat of a bishop. Under Justinian I it was honoured with the title Iustinianopolis. In Byzantine times it changed the name to Hieronda deriving from the Greek name for sanctuary (hieron). This name was used for the village above the temple ruin until the early 20th century (Jeronda) and today the Turks continue to call it Yoran. About 1300 AD the Turks conquered this area of Ionia. Afterwards an earthquake in 1493 destroyed the temple of Apollo and the village was abandoned. About 300 years later the village was resettled by Greeks who used the broken ancient buildings as quarries. == Modern investigations == Pilaster capital at the Temple of Apollo in Didyma. 2nd century BC. When Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli visited the spot in 1446, it seems that the temple was still standing in great part, although the cella had been converted into a fortress by the Byzantines, but when the next European visitor, the Englishmen Jeremy Salter and Dr Pickering, arrived in 1673, it had collapsed. The Society of Dilettanti sent two expeditions to explore the ruins, the first in 1764 under Richard Chandler, the second in 1812 under William Gell. The French \\"Rothschild Expedition\\" of 1873 sent a certain amount of architectural sculpture to the Louvre, but no excavation was attempted until Emmanuel Pontremoli and Bernard Haussoullier were sent out by the French Schools of Rome and Athens in 1895. They cleared the eastern fa√ßade and partly the northern flank, and discovered inscriptions giving information about other parts. German excavations made between 1905 and 1913 revealed all of the incomplete Hellenistic temple of Apollo and some carved fragments that belonged to the earlier Archaic temple and to associated statues. After the Second World War the German Archaeological Institute recommenced the investigations at Didyma in 1962. From now on not only the temple of Apollo was explored but the whole area surrounding the temple. In this way some unknown buildings were discovered. The huge district with the Sacred Way north of the temple of Apollo was excavated by Klaus Tuchelt. There he found the supposed sanctuary of Artemis.Tuchelt, K. (1991). Branchidai-Didyma, p. 24-38. In 1979 Lothar Haselberger discovered scratched drawings on the walls in the courtyard of the temple of Apollo.Haselberger, Die Bauzeichnungen des Apollontempels von Didyma (Deutscher Kunstverlag), 1983; \\"Antike Planzeichnungen am Apollontempel von Didyma\\" Spektrum der Wissenschaft, 1985; \\"Aspekte der Bauzeichnungen von Didyma\\", Revue arch√©ologique, 1991 A closer examination brought the first ancient blueprint of at least two temples (Apollo and Artemis) back to life. Under Klaus Tuchelt and Peter Schneider the Sacred Way from Miletus was investigated, especially the area outside of the sanctuary of Apollo. They found some of the stations of the procession from Miletus to Didyma.Tuchelt, K. (1991). Branchidai-Didyma, p. 38-50. Map of the sanctuary of Apollo at Didyma. In 2003 Andreas Furtwaengler took over the directorship of the excavation of Didyma. His explorations were concentrated on the Archaic period of the Apollo temple and its close surroundings.Furtw√§ngler, A. E. (2009). Didyma: Ein √úberblick √ºber die j√ºngeren Forschungen, Colloquium Anatolicum 8, p. 1-21. Helga Bumke succeeded him 2013. She began in 2001 the exploration of the disposal site of the debris from the Persian looting in 494 BC. Afterwards, also under her auspices, were the discovery of the Greek theatre in 2010/11 and during 2013 the foundations of the temple of Artemis and of another Hellenistic building, residing under a Byzantine chapel.Bumke, H. (2015). Aktuelle Forschungen in Didyma. In: Anatolien - Br√ºcke der Kulturen. p. 325‚Äì343. Since 2009 the excavations are sponsored mainly by the North Rhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences, Humanities and the Arts.http://www.awk.nrw.de/about-us.html ==Buildings== Aerial view of the Temple of Apollo. The sekos of the temple of Apollo. Temple of Apollo: two Ionic columns of the colonnade. The view of the columns from above. ===The temple of Apollo=== The Hellenistic temple had two predecessors. The first sacred building dedicated to Apollo was erected around 700 BC. It was probably a hekatompedos, which means 100 feet long. The width of this first sekos measured 10 meters. 'Sekos' is Greek for ‚Äòcourtyard‚Äô; we can therefore deduce that the late geometric temple and its successors had never been roofed. The oldest temple of Apollo surrounded the sacred spring and the sacred laurel tree. This spring and tree formed the centre of the sanctuary for more than 1000 years. From the middle of the 6th century BC the Milesians raised a new temple and constructed a new altar for Apollo. Alas, of this temple only the foundations of the sekos wall survived. Though as a lot of late Archaic column fragments were found it was likely a Dipteros, which means the sekos was surrounded by two rows of columns. These Ionic columns were partly ornamented with reliefs like the columns of the temple of Artemis in Ephesus. In the western half of the sekos the remains of a small temple were found, the so-called Naiskos, which housed the cult statue of Apollo. The sacred spring in its original location was already dry by the 6th c. BC and had diverted its position to the eastern half of the sekos. In front of this late Archaic temple was a circular building erected to surround the altar for Apollo, which, according to Pausanias,Pausanias, Description of Greece, 5.13.8‚Äì11. was made of blood and ashes of the sacrificed animals. This circular building with the conical altar inside was used until the end of antiquity, whilst to the east and south of the temple stood a stoa for storing some of the famous donations of Apollo.Weber, U. (2015) Der Altar des Apollon von Didyma. In: Mitteilungen des Deutschen Arch√§ologischen Instituts, Abteilung Istanbul. vol. 65, p. 5‚Äì61. The ramifications for the temple after the Ionians lost the navel battle off of the islands of Lade in 494 BC were that most of the buildings of Didyma were heavily damaged by the Persians. The planning for the new Hellenistic temple started after 334 BC. The Milesians resolved to build one of the greatest temples ever made. This goal was not really reached, but they built a temple with a unique plan. The temple of Apollo was clearly planned according to ritual requirements. Though at this present moment, the exact usage and function can only possibly be a matter of conjecture. The temple certainly attained the ambition of being one of the largest ancient temples ever built, its crepidoma with 7 steps measures almost 60 by 120 meters and the stylobate 51 by 109 meters. The temple building itself was surrounded by a double file of Ionic columns, each one of them 19,70 meters high. This consisted of 10 columns along the shorter sides and the 21 columns filling the longer sides, though not all of these were erected even by the end of antiquity. Above the columns followed the architraves with the frieze. The frieze is especially famous as it housed the impressively monumental heads of Medusa. A stone-carved Medusa head The entrance was at the east side. With a pronaos of three rows of four columns, the approaching visitor passed through a regularized grove formed by the columns. The door usually leading to a cella was replaced by a blank wall with a large upper opening through which one could glimpse the upper part of the naiskos in the inner court (in inscriptions the inner court is referred to as ‚Äûsekos\\" or ‚Äûadyton\\"). The impassable threshold of this door stands 1,5 meters above the floor of the pronaos, while the entire door reaches a height of 14 meters. The entry route lay down either of two long constricted sloping tunnels built within the thickness of the walls and giving access to the inner court, still open to the sky but isolated from the world by the 25 meters high walls of the sekos. This was the location of the oracle spring, the laurel tree and the naiskos with the cult statue.http://www.smb- digital.de/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module;=collection&objectId;=698371&viewType;=detailView Relief with the cult statue The foundations of the naiskos are 8,24 meters wide and 14,23 meters long. This Ionic prostylos was built around 300 BC. It is famed because of the superior high quality of its ornamentation. The naiskos with the cult statue of Apollo is depicted on Imperial coins of Miletus.https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8554948v.r=milet%20gordian?rk=42918;4 The sacred oracle spring was not situated in the naiskos, but in the eastern half of the sekos. It was found beneath the early Byzantine church. The inner walls of the sekos were articulated by pilasters. The capitals of them are ornamented with griffins and flowers. Among them a long frieze with griffins decorated the whole sekos. A pilaster capital with griffins. Between the two tunnel exits in the sekos a monumental staircase leads up to three openings into a room whose roof was supported by two columns on the central cross-axis. Among these three doors were placed two Corinthian half columns, whose spectacular capitals originally survived but during the First World War they were unfortunately destroyed. The room with the two central columns opened to the east to the great impassable portal. To the north and south of this hall two stairwells existed. In inscriptions they were called ‚Äûlabyrinthoi\\", probably because of their ceiling decoration showing a meander pattern. These labyrinthoi lead to the roof of the temple and their function is not yet clear.See the corresponding parts in: Wiegand, Th., Knackfu√ü, H. (1941) Die Baubeschreibung, Didyma 1 The ceiling of the \\"labyrinthoi\\" with the famous meander pattern. The oracular procedure so well documented at Delphi is almost unknown at Didyma and must be reconstructed on the basis of the temple's construction. The priestess sat above the oracle spring and was inspired by Apollo. The prophet announced the oracle probably from the room with the high and impassable threshold. The answers were delivered, as in Delphi, in classical hexameters. But at Delphi, nothing was written; at Didyma, inquiries and answers were written and some inscriptions with them were found. In Didyma a small structure, the Chresmographion featured in this process; it was situated outside the temple because according to inscriptions it was used for storing architectural members for the temple there.G√ºnther, W. (1971) Das Orakel von Didyma in hellenistischer Zeit. A base of a column of the eastern facade. Although the construction work continued for over 600 years the temple of Apollo was never completed. But the main body of the temple itself had been completed around 100 BC. In the following centuries Miletus continued to erect the columns of the colonnade. The columns of the eastern fa√ßade were built during the reign of emperor Hadrian. The western facade was completed too and some columns on the flanks. The roof was also never entirely finished; the temple lacked the pediments. There were also other parts of this huge temple which remained unfinished. Therefore, this building is totally unique in Greek architecture. It is like a handbook on this topic which informs you about all the different stages of constructing a temple. When something is unfinished it becomes easier to see the process of construction. This ‚Äûbook\\" begins in the quarries of Miletus at the former Latmian Gulf (today Bafa G√∂l√º) and lead from the harbours there to the harbour of Didyma (former Panormos, today Mavisehir). From there along the road to the sanctuary and then into the sanctuary. At all these places unfinished architectural members of the temple are visible.Peschlow-Bindokat, A. (1981). Die Steinbr√ºche von Milet und Herakleia am Latmos, Jahrbuch des deutschen arch√§ologischen Instituts, vol. 96, p. 157‚Äì214. The inner walls of the sekos remained unpolished too. That's why Lothar Haselberger could discover there the Hellenistic construction drawings. This discovery and interpretation led to some important information about the planning and the building phase of the Apollo temple. In particular, the very famous one of the draft of a column of the temple of Apollo is on the northern sekos wall. On the western wall inside the sekos the inscribed pictorial instructions of the pediment of a small temple is scratched in. Because the inscribed architectural members are similar in style to the naiskos of Apollo Haselberger and other scholars thought that it could have been the design drawings of the naiskos. But one problem persisted unsolved, because the drawn pediment is over 2 meters wider than the actual one of the naiskos of Apollo.Haselberger, L. (1983). Bericht √ºber die Arbeit am J√ºngeren Apollontempel von Didyma, Mitteilungen der Abteilung Istanbul, vol. 33, p. 90-123. The mosque (with the temple of Artemis behind) and the temple of Apollo eastwards This perplexing enigma was eventually unravelled in 2012. It had been clear that the drawing on the western sekos wall would also suit to the rediscovered fragments of architectural members from the temple of Artemis also. So the Hellenistic temple of Artemis was designed with Apollo's naiskos as a model, drawn upon the wall behind the naiskos in the 2nd century BC. The only existing problem was to find a foundation with the width of the drawing (10,71 meters).Bumke H. (2015). Didyma. Bericht √ºber die Arbeiten der Jahre 2010-2013. In: Arch√§ologischer Anzeiger, vol. 2015/1, p. 112-119. ===The temple of Artemis=== Foundations of the temple of Artemis northwards. The foundations of the temple of Artemis were discovered in 2013 directly behind the mosque and former Greek Orthodox church 100 m north of the temple of Apollo. This temple has the dimensions of 31,70 meters long and 11,50 meters wide. These limestone blocks show that the temple of Artemis had three rooms, but it is not altogether clear if it was orientated to the east or to the west because its altar has not yet been found. In contrast to the temple of Apollo the foundation of the temple of Artemis is orientated exactly East-West, as is common for most Greek temples. Parts of its superstructure came not to light in situ. After the excavations the foundations were reinterred after each campaign, so today nothing is visible of them.Bumke H. (2015). Didyma. Bericht √ºber die Arbeiten der Jahre 2010-2013. In: Arch√§ologischer Anzeiger, vol. 2015/1, p. 119-124; Breder, J., Bumke, H. (2016). Die Kulte von Didyma im Licht neu entdeckter Bauten. In: Antike Welt, vol. 2, p. 52‚Äì60. Floor plan of the temple of Artemis (gray: extant foundations; pink:supposed temple orientation to the east) During excavations in 1994, to the south of the mosque, an Ionic architrave and frieze blocks of an unknown building had been excavated. These blocks of white marble bear almost the same pattern and size as architrave and frieze from the Hellenistic naiskos of Apollo. Therefore, it seemed likely they belonged to the elusive and tantalising temple of Artemis because of the twinning stylistic components. But this idea could not be proved until 2012. The architrave and frieze blocks from the Artemis temple are deeper and wider than the ones from Apollo's naiskos. A cornice block (consisting of geison and sima), already found in 1909, but first investigated in 2012 belongs to them. It was the keystone to solve the riddle.Bumke H. (2015). Didyma. Bericht √ºber die Arbeiten der Jahre 2010-2013. In: Arch√§ologischer Anzeiger, vol. 2015/1, p. 112-119. For architrave, frieze and cornice are derived from a wider temple than the naiskos. Further they match perfectly to the construction drawing in the sekos. Finally this construction drawing matches the proportions of the new temple foundation. That means the Ionic temple of Artemis had four front columns and its length was exactly three times longer than its width. Another difference between the naiskos of Apollo and the temple of his sister Artemis concerns the time of their construction. The ornamentation of the naiskos can stylistically be dated around 300 BC, but the ornaments of the temple of Artemis date in the 2nd century BC. Hence the date of the new temple is known, but though it seems likely that it was dedicated to Artemis there remains speculation, especially as no inscription was found on the architectural members?Weber, U. (2015). Ein zweiter hellenistischer Naiskos im Apollonheiligtum von Didyma? (Kurzfassung). In: Koldewey-Gesellschaft, Bericht √ºber die 48. Tagung f√ºr Ausgrabungswissenschaft und Bauforschung, p. 169-171. Older inscriptions from the 6th century BC show that beside Apollo, both Artemis and Hekate had been worshipped in Didyma. Another inscription from the 3rd century BC mentions the cult statue of Artemis. In later inscriptions reconstruction works of the temple of Artemis are reported. Therefore, there can be no doubt that Artemis had her own temple in Didyma. She was the main deity beside Apollo, and to no other deity worshipped in Didyma is a temple documented. Furthermore, Artemis is the twin sister of Apollo. All this leads to the conclusion that this temple designed according to Apollo's naiskos must be the one of Artemis and it stood originally on the promontory north of the temple of Apollo.Tuchelt, K. (1973). Vorarbeiten zu einer Topographie von Didyma, Mitteilungen des Deutschen Arch√§ologischen Instituts, Abteilung Istanbul., Beiheft 9, p. 32-37; Bumke, H. (2015). Aktuelle Forschungen in Didyma. In: Anatolien - Br√ºcke der Kulturen. p. 325‚Äì343. In the end these results contradict Klaus Tuchelt's view that the sanctuary of Artemis was situated west of the sacred way, as Helga Bumke had some years ago already suggested.Tuchelt, K. (1991). Branchidai- Didyma, p. 24-38; Bumke, H. (2006). Die Schwester des Orakelgottes. Zum Artemiskult in Didyma. In: Mylonopoulos, J., Roeder, H., Arch√§ologie und Ritual, p. 215‚Äì237. ===Sacred Way with the Roman baths=== The Sacred Way from Miletus with the remains of the stoa. The Sacred Way inside the sanctuary of Apollo was excavated under Klaus Tuchelt. He found the remains of different buildings from the Archaic period along the wide and plastered road. To the west of the road the rock comes to the surface. Situated there were some wells, basins and small water canals. Their usage is not yet really clear, but they could have had a cultic function. Along the road during the Roman period stood a stoa. It also flanked the passageway to the Roman baths. So the stoai together with the water facilities make it more likely that the complex, of the so-called ‚ÄûFelsbarre\\", served for profane reasons. One option would be a function similar to a Roman macellum (food market), as proposed by Helga Bumke.Bumke, H. (2006). Die Schwester des Orakelgottes. Zum Artemiskult in Didyma. In: Mylonopoulos, J., Roeder, H., Arch√§ologie und Ritual, p. 215‚Äì237. The ruins of the Roman baths northwestwards. The Roman baths at the end of an alley were erected in the 2nd century AD. Rudolf Naumann investigated them and found impressive mosaics in the entrance hall, the apodyterium. It was followed by the frigidarium, the tepidarium and caldarium. The baths were used until the 6th/7th century AD, as were other buildings along the Sacred Way.Naumann, R. (1980). Didyma. Bericht √ºber die Arbeiten der Jahre 1975 - 1979, 2. Die Ausgrabungen bei den Thermen in Didyma. In: Mitteilungen des Deutschen Arch√§ologischen Instituts, Abteilung Istanbul., vol. 30, p. 177-189. ===Stadium=== The southern flank of the temple of Apollo with the stadium. Parallel to the southern colonnade of the temple of Apollo was situated a stadium which dates from the Hellenistic period, though athletic agons were probably held there earlier. The steps of the temple's crepidoma served as seats for the spectators on the northern side of the stadium. Upon these seven steps are engraved many ‚Äûtopos inscriptions\\". Southern crepidoma of the temple of Apollo with a \\"topos inscription\\": Œ¶ŒôŒõŒôŒ£ŒöŒüŒ• (Seat of Philiskos). That means the spectators marked their seats engraving their names. As these inscriptions are also found on the southern part of the western colonnade it seems likely that the stadium was longer than the south side of the temple of Apollo. The average stadium length was usually about 190 meters (one stadion). The seating on the southern side of the stadium consisted of tiers of limestone blocks with seven or eight steps. The remains of a device for starting the contests are extant near the southeast corner of the Apollo temple.Wiegand, Th., Knackfu√ü, H. (1941) Die Baubeschreibung, Didyma 1, p. 132. 140-141. Astonishingly, the blocks of the southern tier of the stadium were reused for the cavea of the theatre in the second half of the 1st century AD. One can but assume that the music agons became more important and influential than the athletic ones. ===Theatre=== The northern wall of the cavea westwards. The remains of the theatre came to light during 2010 and 2011. The walls, stairs and steps of the cavea were a totally unexpected find. Evidence that the theatre arose in the second half of the 1st century AD is indicated by the find of a coin dating from the time of the Roman emperor Nero and a lot of sherds from the same period. Then the cavea had a diameter of 52 meters and could receive 3000 spectators. Later in the first half of the 2nd century AD it was enlarged to a diameter of 61 meters and 4000 spectators would have found a seat. North half of the Cavea with the excavated walls and stairs (gray). At this present time it has not been possible to excavate the foundations of the stage building, but the architectural members of a building typical for a scene building are known since the beginning of the 20th century. After the cavea of the theatre was excavated Helga Bumke suggested that the entablature of the so-called ‚ÄûTabernakel\\" building was part of the scene building. The inscribed dedications on the architraves reveals that the stage building was consecrated to the gods Apollo, Artemis, Leto, Zeus, the emperor Hadrian and the people of Miletus. But it is not known who dedicated this building. As emperor Hadrian visited Miletus and Didyma in 129 AD the scene building was probably complete by that time. The winners of the musical contests, organized to worship Apollo, were honoured in several inscriptions from the Roman period. These competitions took place in the newly found theatre, but it can be assumed that a Hellenistic predecessor existed. An inscription from the beginning 3rd century BC reports that Antiochos I received a seat of honuor during the choir contests at Didyma.Bumke, H. (2013). ¬ªKulte im Kult¬´ ‚Äì Der sakrale Mikrokosmos in extraurbanen griechischen Heiligt√ºmern am Beispiel von Didyma ‚Äì Erste Ergebnisse. In: K√∂lner und Bonner Archaeologica, vol. 2, p. 181‚Äì187; Bumke H. (2015). Didyma. Bericht √ºber die Arbeiten der Jahre 2010-2013. In: Arch√§ologischer Anzeiger, vol. 2015/1, p. 125-146. ===Other Buildings=== The ancient inscriptions of Didyma testify that many more buildings existed there in antiquity than the mentioned ones above. During the many years of excavations hundreds of architectural fragments came to light which could be not allocated to a known building or monument. One of them is a Doric stoa from the 2nd century BC, and another one the so-called ‚ÄûProphetenhaus\\" or chresmographeion, a smaller Doric building also from the 2nd century BC. The search of the foundations of these and other structures is difficult because the area around Apollo's temple is closely built-up. Therefore, it is almost impossible to use geophysical prospecting methods for the search. Interpreting the written sources and old maps make it possible to find places with ancient foundations. This was done by Helga Bumke in the case of the foundation of the temple of Artemis and another Hellenistic foundation southeast of the temple of Apollo in 2013. This squarish substructure measuring 11 meters by 12 meters consisted of limestone blocks, but no superstructure came to light. It may have had a cultic function because it is characterised by the same curious orientation as the temple of Apollo. Above the substructure was a small church built in Byzantine times which has seen several reconstructions up until the 19th century.Bumke H. (2015). Didyma. Bericht √ºber die Arbeiten der Jahre 2010-2013. In: Arch√§ologischer Anzeiger, vol. 2015/1, p. 146-155. ===Churches=== The mosque and formerly church northwards (the foundations of the temple of Artemis are behind). The most famous church of Didyma stood in the sekos of the temple of Apollo. Its final remains were demolished in 1925. This church was made with blocks from the naiskos and other small buildings from outside the temple around 500 AD. After a serious earthquake in the 7th century AD, a reconstruction of the three- aisled basilica was erected. In the 11th century AD, another earthquake occurred and the church in the sekos collapsed. This was replaced by only a small chapel which was used for the Christian cult. Another early Christian church was constructed 100 meters north of the temple of Apollo, at approximately the same location where today the mosque stands. This church also employed the use of ancient blocks salvaged from the temple of Artemis nearby and the previously mentioned Doric stoa above. Its later history is not yet clear, but in 1830 their remains were used to erect a new church for the recently arrived Greek settlers. In 1924 it was converted into a mosque for the Muslims just transported from North Greece during the Exchange of Populations. More chapels or churches surely existed in Byzantine Didyma because it was the seat of a bishopric, but about this age little is known. Some of these Byzantine churches either fell into disrepair or used as animal pens after the area was abandoned in the 16th century and reused by the newly settled Greeks at the end of the 18th century when the quarrying of the temple marble became a profitable trade.Wiegand, Th., Knackfu√ü, H. (1941) Die Baubeschreibung, Didyma 1, p. 29-45. 142-149; Bumke H. (2015). Didyma. Bericht √ºber die Arbeiten der Jahre 2010-2013.

It was first presented on Broadway on March 17, 1957 but had only a brief run (68 performances) and modest success.\\"Orpheus Descending\\" (1957) on the Internet Broadway Database It was revived on Broadway in 1989, directed by Peter Hall and starring Vanessa Redgrave and Kevin Anderson. The production ran for 13 previews and 97 performances.\\"Orpheus Descending\\" (1989) on the Internet Broadway Database The play is a rewrite of an earlier play by Williams called Battle of Angels, which was written in 1940. Williams wrote the character of Myra Torrance for Tallulah Bankhead, but she turned down the role, saying \\"The play is impossible, darling, but sit down and have a drink with me.\\" The production premiered on Broadway the same year, starring Miriam Hopkins. It was the first produced play written by Williams and by his account it \\"failed spectacularly\\". Battle of Angels remained un-produced in New York for 34 years, until the Circle Repertory Company opened their sixth season with it in 1974, directed by Marshall W. Mason. Williams was rewriting Battle of Angels by 1951.[5] Williams, Tennessee. The Selected Letters of Tennessee Williams, Volume II, 1945‚Äì1957. New York: New Directions, 2004, p. 380 When Orpheus Descending appeared in 1957, Williams wrote: \\"On the surface it was and still is the tale of a wild-spirited boy who wanders into a conventional community of the South and creates the commotion of a fox in a chicken coop. But beneath that now familiar surface it is a play about unanswered questions that haunt the hearts of people and the difference between continuing to ask them...and the acceptance of prescribed answers that are not answers at all.\\" == Description == The play is a modern retelling of the ancient Greek Orpheus legend and deals, in the most elemental fashion, with the power of passion, art, and imagination to redeem and revitalize life, giving it new meaning. The story is set in a dry goods store in a small southern town marked, in the play, by conformity, sexual frustration, narrowness, and racism. Into this scene steps Val, a young man with a guitar, a snakeskin jacket, a questionable past, and undeniable animal-erotic energy and appeal. He gets a job in the dry goods store run by a middle-aged woman named Lady, whose elderly husband is dying. Lady has a past and passions of her own. She finds herself attracted to Val and to the possibility of new life he seems to offer. It is a tempting antidote to her loveless marriage and boring, small-town life. The play describes the awakening of passion, love, and life ‚Äì as well as its tragic consequences for Val and Lady. The play deals with passion, its repression and its attempted recovery. On another level, it is also about trying to live bravely and honestly in a fallen world. The play is replete with lush, poetic dialogue and imagery. On the stage, the opening sections seem somewhat lacking in dramatic movement, but the play picks up power as the characters are developed and it moves to its climax. Val, representing Orpheus, represents the forces of energy and eros, which, buried as they are in compromise and everyday mundanity, have the tragic power to create life anew. == Plot == Dolly and Beulah, two gossiping housewives, tell each other that Jabe Torrance has just had surgery in Memphis but is dying. Carol Cutrere comes in a little later and Val, a roaming singer and musician, comes into the general store. Carol flirts with Val, insisting she has met him before in New Orleans, but he denies any prior knowledge of her. Lady agrees to hire Val as a clerk. After a few weeks, Val tells Lady about his wild past in New Orleans and admits that he once knew Carol. When David enters the store, Lady tells David that she aborted his child when he left her. Val and Vee are talking about her painting when Vee's husband, Talbot, catches him kissing her hand. Lady allows Val to stay at the store, but Val steals money from the cashbox when she leaves to get linens for the bed. Val returns the money and wants to leave, but Lady begs him to stay. On Easter, Jabe tells Lady he was responsible for her father's death and has a hemorrhage. At sunset, Vee says she has been blinded by a vision of the risen Christ and Val is yelled at by Vee's husband for helping her up. Vee's husband, Sheriff Talbot, tells him he has until sunset to get out of town. Val is ready to leave but Lady tries to stop him. She tries to get the nurse to kill her husband with a lethal dose of morphine, but the nurse will not. Then Lady tells Val she is happily pregnant with his child, and tells Val she looks forward to a new life because of this. Both walk about the newly decorated refreshment emporium adjoining the store, symbolizing the promise of a new start. As Val and Lady embrace, Val looks up to see that Jabe has torn a hole through his floor, and thus through the ceiling of the emporium, and is throwing coal oil into the place, setting it on fire while yelling out the upstairs window that Val has set the place on fire and is \\"robbing the place.\\" Lady escapes through the door of the emporium and heads up the stairs towards Jabe's room yelling \\"No Jabe, no!\\" whereupon Jabe shoots Lady on the stairway. As Lady dies, the local sheriff and fire squad break through the front door, and seeing Val trying to get out of the emporium, open their water hoses full force in an ultimately successful attempt to push him back into the burning building, thus murdering him. Lady calls out for him while dying from her husband Jabe's gunshots. In the final scene, Carol walks in the remains of the burnt-out emporium while another transient looks about and discovers Val's snakeskin jacket. Carol trades a gold ring for the jacket and offers a soliloquy on \\"the fugitive kind.\\" == Adaptations == In 1959, a screen adaptation starring Marlon Brando and Anna Magnani appeared under the title The Fugitive Kind; it was directed by Sidney Lumet, and flopped like the stage production.Jacobsen, Colin. \\"The Fugitive Kind\\" DVD Movie Guide website (April 20, 2010) Orpheus Descending, a more faithful version ‚Äì a film adaptation of the Peter Hall stage production ‚Äì was released in 1990, starring Vanessa Redgrave.

It is often contrasted with the better-known extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH), and is particularly popular among UFO researchers in the United Kingdom, such as David Clarke, Hilary Evans, the editors of Magonia magazine, and many of the contributors to Fortean Times magazine. It is also popular in France since the publication in 1977 of a book written by Michel Monnerie,Monnerie, M. (1977). Et si les ovnis n'existaient pas? Paris : Les Humano√Ødes Associ√©s. Et si les ovnis n'existaient pas? (What if ufos do not exist?). UFOlogists claim that the psychosocial hypothesis is occasionally confused with aggressive anti-ETH debunking, but that there is an important difference in that the PSH researcher sees UFOs as an interesting subject that is worthy of serious study, even if it is approached in a skeptical (i.e. non-credulous) way.\\"Ritual Debunker Abuse\\", the Hierophant, Fortean Times issue 216 (November 2006), page 13. The psychosocial hypothesis builds on the finding that most ufo reports have mundane explanations like celestial objects, airplane lights, balloons, and a host of other misperceived things seen in the sky which suggests the presence of an unusual emotional climate which distorts perceptions and the perceived significance and anomalousness of merely terrestrial stimuli.Allan Hendry, The UFO Handbook, Doubleday, 1979, p. 154\\"Allan Hendry Comments on Dr. Westrum's Review\\" (of The UFO Handbook) Zetetic Scholar #5, 1979, pp. 107-10.Elaine Hendry \\"Comments on J. Richard Greenwell's 'Theories, Hypotheses, and Speculations on the Origins of UFOs'\\" Zetetic Scholar, #7, 1980, pp. 79-80. In the more exotic situation where people claim direct contact with extraterrestrials, the need for a psychosocial approach seems obligated by the presence of at least 70 claims of people meeting Venusians and at least 50 claims of meeting Martians; both worlds now known to be uninhabitable and devoid of any advanced civilization. Hoaxing seems to explain some of these contactees claims, but visionary dreams, hallucinations, and other mental processes are clearly implicated in such myth-based material. By generalization, the other material suggesting the presence of extraterrestrial entities from elsewhere is hypothesized to be explainable by similar means. The observed presence of surreal dream-like activity and imagery or themes based in the cultural environment and historically understood sources reinforces the proposition that the extraterrestrial hypothesis is unnecessary and, by Occam's razor, probably incorrect. ==Origin== In the English UFO literature, the term psycho-social hypothesis first achieved prominence in April 1984 when the cover of Magonia featured \\"The Rise of the Psycho-social hypothesis\\" by Jacques Scornaux and Peter Rogerson. Scornaux's use of the term traces back to French UFO controversies spawned by Michel Monnerie whose book Le Naufrage des Extra- terrestres (1979) presented \\"le mod√®le socio-psychologique\\" as a direct challenge to the extraterrestrial hypothesis.Michel Monnerie, Le Naufrage des Extra-terrestres, Nouvelles Editions Rationalistes, 1979, p. 56. Claude Maug√© had exposed Magonia readers to a brief outline of \\"the socio-psychological model\\" emerging from French studies in 1983, but flipping the syllables made the term more conventional to existing academic vocabulary.Claude Mauge \\"Questioning the 'Real' Phenomenon\\" Magonia #13 1983, pp. 3-5, 15. Rogerson's adopting the term represented to him an evolution and de-escalation of exotic hypotheses he had been entertaining that originally included paranormal notions like psi, collective hallucinations, and the collective unconscious. The term marked the embrace of a fully normal system of psychological processes that included dreams, hallucinations, fantasy interpretations of materially real stimuli, distortions of perception, and metachoric experiences. These were things influenced by cultural myths, social conditioning, and historical context. Since 1968, the circle of writers who wrote for Magonia had been exploring alternatives to the ETH under a general sense that it had failed to account for much of what was being seen in the high strangeness cases. Roger Sandell spoke of being a nuts and bolts ufologist till he realized that ufo reports he had gathered from a 1905 Welsh wave made little sense and were part of a larger complex of ghost stories and religious visions. He notes that ufological thought had once been dominated by theories that Venus and Mars were the source of ufos, but the space program had shown they were in fact quite lifeless. Add in the apocalyptic and demonological material of then contemporary ufo thinking and the need for a major re-think seemed obliged. Could it all be mundane products of the human mind such as dreams, rumors and hoaxes?Roger Sandell, Peter Rogerson, John Rimmer \\"Ten Years On: The Editors Look Back on a Decade of Ufology\\" MUFOB, new series 10 spring 1978, pp. 7-8, 16. Peter Rogerson had similarly become convinced we are seeing the rise of a contemporary mythology and advocated for a comprehensive search for historical antecedents of ufo rumors. He began the search for the social factors driving ufo flaps and social panics. Magonia writers would point to \\"a relationship between ufo waves and times of radical social change\\"\\"Notes & Quotes\\" Magonia #3 Spring 1980, pp. 10-11. with Rogerson offering that the 1954 French flap had occurred at \\"a time of national defeat and government crisis.\\"Peter Rogerson, \\"Towards a revisionist history of Ufology\\" MUFOB new series #13 Winter 1978/9, pp. 13-15. In one striking piece, he offered a lengthy meditation on the social resonances and ideological influences shaping the varying beliefs found among ufo writers over the course of ufo history.Peter Rogerson \\"Why Have All the UFOs Gone?\\" Magonia #7 1981 pp. 3-9, 13-15. Allen Greenfield confessed in Magonia in 1979 he had become disenchanted with the divisive emotionality and groupthink of ufo culture and worried about the influence of belief he eventually saw in his early work advocating the ETH. He was starting to think the bigger mystery was not what ufos were, but \\"What are we to make of the whole world-wide rumor complex‚Ä¶what are we to make of the rumor ‚Äì the ufo mythos?\\" What was the meaning of all the mythologizing that attends the spread of the ufo rumor?Allen H. Greenfield \\"Confessions of a Ufologist\\" MUFOB, new series 15 summer 1979, pp. 7-8, 13. http://magonia.haaan.com/category/author/greenfield- allen/ ==Science fiction aspects of the UFO mythos== Bertrand M√©heust, a French sociologist, began a study of the science fiction parallels to ufo mythology when he stumbled upon a copy of the 1908 novel The Lightning Wheel by Jean de la Hire in his family's attic. He opened it and began reading how the central characters find themselves being lifted up by a ray into a flying disc that hums and glows with a halo of light.Jeffrey J. Kripal, Authors of the Impossible: The Paranormal and the Sacred, University of Chicago Press, 2010, pp. 206‚Äì8. The discovery stimulated a search for parallels between ufo experience narratives and pre-1947 science fiction literature. Meheust found dozens of them, many of the more impressive including such wondrous effects as invisible force-fields, mesmeric mental effects, materializations and dematerializations, teleportation, traveling through walls, levitating entities, and engine-stopping rays.Bertrand Meheust, Science Fiction et Soucoupes Volantes Mercure de France, 1978 One could also find humanoids visiting earth for a range of motives that parallel later UFO thought: wanting to spy on humans, experiment on us, breed with us, create a multi-generational program to shape humanity, deal with their dying world, invade our world, and teach us lessons about cosmic history and the need for peace. While some of this can be relegated to coincidences driven by similar reasoning and expectations about the future, often these wonders are more reminiscent of supernatural and old occult mythology than what is really reasonably expected to be created using future technology. Michel Monnerie wove Meheust's study into his larger historical critique of what shaped ufo mythology.Michel Monnerie, Le Naufrage des Extra-terrestres, Nouvelles Editions Rationalistes, 1979. Michel Meurger deserves special mention for expanding Meheust's thesis into an impressive compendium of parallels brimming with nearly 800 footnotes and a set of dozens of illustrations.Michel Meurger, ALIEN ABDUCTION: L'enl√®vement Extraterrestre de la Fiction √† la croyance -- Scientifictions: la Revue de l'Imaginaire Scientifique; numero 1, volume 1 Encrage, 1995 (in French) 253pp. One subsequent paper, in English, presents a focused historical study, showing a continuum between the nightmarish medical horrors experienced in modern ufo abduction narratives, back through the mad scientists of pulp science fiction, that built in turn upon anti-vivisection propaganda and rumors circulating in the 19th century.Michel Meurger, \\"Surgeons from Outside\\" Fortean Studies # 3 (1996) pp. 308‚Äì21. Jacques Vallee was among the first ufologists to note that electromagnetic effects associated with ufos could be found in earlier fiction such as a play written by Arthur Koestler and the first flying saucer novel ‚Äì Bernard Newman's The Flying Saucer (1948).Jacques Vallee, Dimensions: A Casebook of Alien Contact Contemporary Books, 1988, p. 167. This observation has been expanded in one study published in Magonia that traces a continuum of anti-machine machines back through wartime rumors about Marconi developing engine-stopping rays and a sizeable culture backdrop of films, film serials, and pulp stories imagining future wars and the superweapons that would fight them.Martin S. Kottmeyer, Magonia #90; November 2005, pp. 3‚Äì15. \\"Engine Stoppers \\" Meheust early saw that the more common species of aliens in ufo experiences were well represented in the Hugo Gernsback era (1926‚Äì36) pulps.Bertrand Meheust, Science Fiction et Soucoupes Volantes Mercure de France, 1978, pp. 126‚Äì35. This insight has been followed up in increasing detail by subsequent researchers. Grays, in particular, are now well understood as having been a stereotype in large part because Gernsback specifically asked his writers to do stories where future evolution caused beings to develop large brains but atrophied bodies caused by technology making muscles irrelevant to survival.Mike Ashley and Robert A.W. Lowndes, The Gernsback Days: A Study of the evolution of modern science fiction from 1911 to 1936 Wildside, 2004, p. 169.Martin Kottmeyer \\"Ghostly Grays: Earlier Hauntings\\" Magonia Supplement #60; 7 February 2006, pp. 3-5.http://www.users.waitrose.com/~magonia/ms60.htm Gernsback loved H.G. Wells's writings, reprinted his work, and it was Wells who first developed the logic of such degenerative evolution which he inserted into his masterwork War of the Worlds (1898).Ronald Story, ed. The Encyclopedia of Extraterrestrial Encounters: A Definitive Illustrated A-Z Guide to All Things Alien New American Library, 2001, pp. 223-30. Important modifications to the stereotype were introduced by the creative team that built the aliens appearing at the climax of Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Completely black eyes and thin pencil necks soon appeared on bald brainy aliens in ufo encounters in mimicry of film imagery. While the public was given the impression that the aliens would be based on those found in ufo investigations; the CE3K alien design team had never been given drawings to base their work on. They were only given a brief verbal directive that they should be large-headed and short.Ronald Story, ed.

Allen Hynek in 1977: \\"Why flying saucers? Why not flying cubes or flying pyramids, or for that matter, why not flying pink elephants or even flying buildings, reported from a hundred different countries? Indeed if UFO reports were entirely the result of excited imaginations, why not hundreds, possibly thousands, of totally and radically different types of reports as people of different cultures let their locally conditioned imaginations loose?\\"Hynek UFO Report, Dell, 1977, p. 28. Ufo historian David M. Jacobs, phrased things somewhat differently in 1987: \\"there was no precedent for the appearance or the configuration of the objects in 1947\\" in popular science fiction films, popular science fiction or popular culture in general. They did not resemble the fanciful rocketships or earthly space travel contraptions in the SF literature.David M. Jacobs, \\"The New Era of UFO Research\\", Pursuit, no. 78, 1987, p. 50. In 1988, Martin Kottmeyer observed a colleague trying to speculate that the source of saucer imagery lay in a certain art movement. While the notion immediately struck him as wrong, he began to think about what might be a better approach. He soon began gathering together what writings he could find about the Kenneth Arnold UFO sighting in 1947, typically pointed to as the start of the modern ufo phenomenon. One of the first things he turned to was a memoir given as a speech before the First International UFO Congress in 1977.Kenneth Arnold, \\"How It All Began,\\" in Curtis Fuller, ed., Proceedings of the First International UFO Congress, Warner Books, 1980, pp. 17-30. His eye soon fell on a statement by Arnold that the objects he sighted \\"were not circular.\\" Arnold also complained the flying saucer label arose because of a \\"great deal of misunderstanding\\" on the part of the reporter who wrote the story up for the Associated Press.Arnold incorrectly said United Press in his memoir, this is the correct attribution of the news service involved. Bill Bequette asked him how the objects flew and Arnold answered that, \\"Well, they flew erratic, like a saucer if you skip it across the water.\\" The intent of the metaphor was to describe the motion of the objects not their shape. Bill Bequette would later insist the fault was not with him, but Arnold himselfRonald Story, ed. The Encyclopedia of Extraterrestrial Encounters: A Definitive Illustrated A-Z Guide to All Things Alien New American Library, 2001, pp. 88-9 but, ultimately it does not matter who is to blame for it. The only salient fact is that a mistake was definitely made somewhere. Any doubt about this is eliminated by turning to the first document written by Kenneth Arnold, the report he wrote and sent to Air Force mere days after his sighting nine mystery objects speeding across the face of Mount Rainier.Brad Steiger, Project Blue Book, Ballantine 1976, p. 33 It includes a drawing of the shapes made by one of the objects. It is certainly confirms the memoir. It isn't circular or round as a saucer properly ought to be. Shoe heel or beetle might better express the awkwardly inelegant form. The logical implications of saucers being a mistake had the feel of paradigm shift to Kottmeyer, like suddenly learning that one of the axioms one learned in school forming the base of Euclidean geometric reasoning had just changed. One was not living in a Euclidean universe, but a Riemannian one where a straight line was no longer the shortest distance between two points. All those people in 1947 who reported seeing circular, disc-shaped, saucer-shaped crafts (82% of the 853 cases collected by Ted Bloecher)Martin S. Kottmeyer, \\"A Plastic Phenomenon,\\" The REALL News 6, #2, February 1998, pp. 1, 7-11.http://www.reall.org/newsletter/v11/n01/reall-news-v11-n01.pdf had based their expectations on a mistake, a rumor with journalistic credentials. They weren't seeing what Arnold saw, only what they were told he saw. Similarly the rumor shaped the ufo phenomenon for decades afterwards keeping the shape dominant throughout the culture, shaping film imagery, saucer photography, ufo illustration, contactee tales, and high strangeness abduction experiences By one tally 82% of the craft descriptions in alien abduction reports fall into the flying saucer category.Bullard, Thomas E., \\"UFO Abductions: The Measure of a Mystery. Volume 1: Comparative Study of Abduction Reports.\\" Fund for UFO Research, 1987, p. 196. It can be found in nearly all the well-known cases: Betty & Barney Hill's interrupted journey, Herb Schirmer, Travis Walton, the Andreasson affair, Whitley Strieber Kottmeyer first reported his discovery in a letter to Saucer Smear published April 25, 1988.Saucer Smear 35, #3 p.7 It was more widely disseminated when the finding was published as part of an article titled \\"Entirely Unpredisposed\\" that appeared first in Magonia in 1990.Martin Kottmeyer, \\"Entirely Unpredisposed,\\" Magonia #35, January 1990, pp. 3-10; reprinted in The Skeptic, 8, #3, 1994, pp. 17-18. There he spelled out its full argumentative significance: \\"The implications of this journalistic error are staggering in the extreme. Not only does it unambiguously point to a cultural origin of the whole flying saucer phenomenon, it erects a first-order paradox into any attempt to interpret the phenomenon in extraterrestrial terms: Why would extraterrestrials redesign their craft to conform to Bequette's error?\\" In 1993, he offered a fuller account of the significance of the finding in a piece titled \\"The Saucer Error.\\"Martin Kottmeyer, The REALL News, 1, #4, May 1993, pp. 1, 6. http://www.reall.org/newsletter/v01/n04/index.html Some ETH skeptics embraced Kottmeyer's arguments and tried to expand it with additional material concerning Arnold's writings. The cover of Arnold's 1950 memoir of the 1947 incident The Saucer As I Saw It has been pointed to as showing a more crescent-shaped craft than that drawn in the AF report. A photo of Arnold holding a sketch showing yet another subtly different shape has also been pointed to as significant. While not uninteresting flourishes to the story, one should not ignore that historical investigation always privileges the earliest documents of a case and those generated by the witness over later and second-hand journalistic quotes. Late images and writings are vulnerable to a range of doubts concerning both memory and distortions arising from revisions shaped by late arriving issues and fluid fashions of interpretation, reason enough to ignore them. The principal counterargument advanced to save the ETH is that flying saucers were seen before Kenneth Arnold's story hit the headlines and those could not have been shaped by the rumor. Many of these reports were never published, let alone investigated, before Arnold became news and so are vulnerable to errors of memory and suggestion. Even if any are eventually found with a satisfactory pedigree, the argument overlooks that Hynek and Jacobs only offered the questions they did because saucers are the dominant shape of ufos after 1947. No amount of research is ever go change the fact that saucers make up only a trivial percentage of things seen in the sky before 1947 and will never be proven to be dominant. The fallacy of this approach is demonstrated by imagining what a Hynek-like thinker, immersed in the reports of the airship era (1896/7), asked and answered, \\"Why cigar-shaped and not globes or cubes?\\" and then was told that reports of a slow, low-flying cigar-shaped object in 1347 A.D.Jacques Vallee and Chris Aubeck, Wonders in the Sky: Unexplained Aerial Objects from Antiquity to Modern Times and their Impact on Human Culture, History, and Beliefs, Jeremy P. Tarcher / Penguin, 2010, case #125. meant he had not found the source of the problem. He would clearly dismiss the report as irrelevant ‚Äì the implicit issue is explaining the dominance of the shape. The rumor generated by Arnold's report is the clear answer to Hynek's question, regardless of minor cases that were exceptions to the dominants of their own era. ==Flaps of flying phantoms== One of the more striking failures of the ETH has been in the realm of offering explanations of UFO flaps. In the first couple decades of the saucer controversy, several researchers sought to argue that flaps were generated by saucers timing their arrival to the proximity of Mars. Predictions were generated, but notably failed.Dove, Lonzo \\"The Mars Explosions and the Flying Saucers,\\" Space Review, 2, #3 July 1953, p. 3.Jarrold, Edgar R. \\"Spotlight on Australia,\\" Space Review, 2, #3 July 1953, p. 6.Lord, Harry \\"Search for Patterns\\" Flying Saucers, January 1963, pp. 66-9.Aim√© Michel, Flying Saucers and the Straight-Line Mystery Criterion, 1958, pp. 205-6. One 1962 study remarked, \\"If one works with data limited to the period 1950 to 1956 one can argue a correlation as strong as one in a thousand against chance existed.\\"Jacques Vall√©e & Janine Vall√©e, \\"Mars and the Flying Saucers: A contribution to the scientific study of the periodicity of the flying saucer phenomenon in its correlation with the oppositions of Mars\\" Flying Saucer Review, 8, #5, September‚ÄìOctober 1962, pp 5-11. Outside this limited set, however, it is clear no correlation can be found. Charles H. Smiley, Chairman of the Department of Astronomy at Brown University computed 14 ideal minimum energy orbits for transportation from Mars to Earth and Venus to Earth between 1956 and 1965 and determined the likely arrival times plus and minus ten days. He then looked at the number of ufo reports to Blue Book for these periods. They were self-evidently insignificant and corresponded to no flaps.Charles Smiley, \\"The 8:05 from Mars is Late,\\" The New Report on Flying Saucers by True magazine #2, 1967, pp. 30-1, 65. Other researchers argued flaps were indications of phased operations, indications of the construction of bases, or ways of desensitizing humanity to the extraterrestrial presence before overt Contact or a Mass Landing, which would culminate in the imminent future.Frank Edwards, Flying Saucers-Serious Business Bantam, 1966 pp. 182-3.Frank Edwards, Flying Saucers-Here and Now Bantam, 1968 pp. 159-60.John A. Keel, \\"'Flap Dates,' Kidnappings, and Secret Bases\\" True: The New Report on Flying Saucers, #2 Fawcett Publications, 1967, pp. 14-17, 56-60.Richard Hall, Uninvited Guests, Aurora, 1988, pp. 213, 216-7. These predictions clearly failed as well. British researchers, puzzled by the failures decided to take things in new directions: Peter Rogerson would write, \\"There should be a major co- operative effort at a systematic search for pre-1947 'waves,' involving, if possible, full scrutiny of national and local newspapers, and scientific and popular magazines, starting with flap periods, then other periods.\\" Attention should be paid to \\"the social, religious, political and scientific background.\\"Peter Rogerson, \\"New Directions for UFO Research.\\" Merseyside UFO Bulletin volume 5, number 2, May 1972, Roger Sandell's work on a 1905 outbreak of ufo sighting in Wales had already suggested that these earlier flaps had odd facets, some of the high strangeness material echoed modern cases, but not in the ways might hope if one thought them extraterrestrial. Mary Jones encountered a sinister black clad man she identified as Satan, but would probably thought an MIB had it not been 1905 Wales.Roger Sandell, \\"UFOs in Wales in 1905\\" Flying Saucer Review 17, #4, July/August 1971, pp. 24-5. Other Men in Black were seen and one figure turned into a black dog before one witness's eyes.Roger Sandell, \\"More on Welsh UFOs\\" Flying Saucer Review 18, #2 March/April 1972, pp. 31-3.Kevin McClure, Stars & Rumors of Stars, undated.Kevin McClure, \\"Welsh Lights\\" in Peter Brookesmith, The Alien World, Black Cat, 1984, pp. 20-20. Noting such things only add to the complexity of the ufo phenomenon he urged progress could only be made by detailed research conducted with no preconceptions. Nigel Watson, in time, began reporting on his research into a March‚ÄìMay 1909 panic involving the belief that German airships were spying on Britain.Nigel Watson, The Cigar Ship of 1909!

These flaps generally involved cigar-shaped craft more reminiscent of Zeppelins than extraterrestrial spacecraft and were attended by rumors of foreign spies and spy networks. They often had their own forms of physical evidences, multiple witnesses to crafts with improbable details, and surreal close encounters. The rumors all had idiosyncratic aspects which pointed to a need to interpret them in terms of the contemporary societal backdrop ‚Äì often tensions about impending war, sometimes political conflicts within the society. By the 1930s, the imagery of phantom airships was replaced by phantom aeroplanes ‚Äì 'ghost fliers' in places including Scandinavia and Britain. Later phantom flier imagery transmutes into Foo-fighters and ghost rockets, in accordance with new rumors and newer facts of evolving modern technology.Nigel Watson, Phantom Aerial Flaps and Waves, Magonia magazine 1987, 23 pp. One researcher would point out that a mid-1600s boom in prophecies accompanied rumors of the imminent overthrow of King and Church. The aligning of aerial phenomena and political events had been alleged as early as John Aubrey, the antiquary, concerning events in 1647. A series of sightings of second suns, second moons, and marching of armies in the sky, it was assumed significantly, preceded the 1662 Act of Uniformity and the revival of the Church of England.John Fletcher, \\"Lo! He comes in clouds descending,\\" Magonia #1 Autumn 1979, pp. 3-8. http://magonia.haaan.com/2009/clouds/ The imagery of these earlier flaps give little ground to broad extraterrestrial interpretations: they no longer look futuristic in the slightest with their Zeppelin shapes, propellors, flapping wings, masts, ship decking, and humans in contemporary attire. It seems irrefutable that social forces are necessary to account for them. Whatever the ultimate explanations of individual modern ufo flaps prove to be, it is blatant that social forces can be a sufficient cause in creating emotional climates favorable to frequent sightings of things in the sky that are not fully real. In the spirit of being engaged in \\"a long, slow process of trial & error studies\\",Peter Rogerson \\"Towards a Revisionist History of Ufology\\" MUFOB new series #13 Winter 1978/9, pp. 13-15. variations in these explanations have been experimented with. The 1905 Wales flap occurred at a time that the traditional values were under assault from the modern world. The religious revival associated with the sightings maybe were generated by the tensions of rapid, unprecedented social change.Peter Rogerson, \\"Future Shock\\" and UFO Cults. Merseyside UFO Bulletin, Volume 6, Number 2, August 1973: Psychosocial researchers have looked into other notions like Phil Klass's notion that media is the primary driver of flaps but they find it so scandalously error-riddled,Martin S. Kottmeyer,\\"Did Life Magazine Help Spawn the 1952 UFO Wave?\\" Magonia Supplement #48; 21 October 2003, pp. 1-3. http://www.users.waitrose.com/~magonia/ms48.htmMartin S. Kottmeyer, \\"Keyhoe and the 'Modest Surge' of 1950\\" Magonia Supplement #49; 16 February 2004; pp. 1-2. http://www.users.waitrose.com/~magonia/ms49.htmMartin S. Kottmeyer, \\"Do Ufo Films Stimulate Ufo Flaps?\\" Magonia Supplement #57; 5 July 2005; pp. 1-6. http://www.users.waitrose.com/~magonia/ms57.htmMartin Kottmeyer, \\"UFO Flaps: An Analysis ‚Äì The Alexander Imich Award Winning UFO Essay\\" in The Anomalist #3, Winter 1995/96, pp. 64-89.; revised in Ronald Story, ed. The Encyclopedia of Extraterrestrial Encounters: A Definitive Illustrated A-Z Guide to All Things Alien New American Library, 2001, pp. 650-1. it is difficult to accept it has anything like the sizeable role he alleges. Media doubtless contributes imagery, but the emotional component of the rumors associated with flaps relies on larger aspects of the social environment. It is necessary to add that researchers in the psychosocial tradition have not held much respect for glib notions of flaps like mass hysteria e.g. as when expressed back in 1954 by the French psychiatrist George Heuyer.George Heuyer, \\"Note sur les psychoses collectives.\\" Bulletin de l'Acad√©mie Nationale de M√©decine, 138, 29-30, 487-490. By the time they were writing, doubts had already been expressed. Mark Rhine in the Condon report and Robert Hall for the 1969 AAAS symposium on UFOs looked at certain classic episodes of mass hysteria or hysterical contagion like the June bug epidemic, the Seattle windshield pitting epidemic, and the Mad Gasser of Mattoon, to see how well they could serve as explanatory models for what is going on with the ufo phenomenon. Neither developed the idea very far and Hall discerned several difficulties in comparing these phenomena, probably the most notable being the fleeting character of those model social epidemics.Robert L. Hall, \\"Sociological Perspectives on UFO Reports\\" in Carl Sagan and Thornton Page, eds., UFOs: A Scientific Debate WW Norton, 1974, pp. 213-23. Michael Swords later offered additional observations that essentially killed it for researchers on both sides of the debate.Michael D. Swords, \\"Mass Hysteria & Multiple-Witness Sightings\\" MUFON Ufo Journal #197 September 1984, pp. 16-19. In a recent discussion of Great Britain's Warminster flap of the 1960s, the researchers echo these developments and prefer to discuss the flap as a collective delusion maintained by rumor and gossip.Steve Dewey and John Ries, In Alien Heat: The Warminster Mystery Revisited, Anomalist Books, 2006, pp. 214-7. Given the general decline of respect for the broader concept of hysteria in modern psychology; this seems just as well. ==The Modern Myth of Jung== With his essay Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies (1958), Carl Gustav Jung can be seen as one of the founding fathers of the PSH. Some also say that because of his use of the concept of synchronicity in this book,C.G. Jung, Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies Bollingen Series: Princeton University Press, 1978 Passage # 789 he is also one of the founding fathers of paranormal explanations of the UFO phenomena. ETH advocates sometimes say that while Jung approached UFOs psychologically because he was a psychologist, he was also on record as stating that some might be true physical objects under intelligent control, citing in particular radar corroboration. They say Jung truly seriously considered the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis. The Associated Press quoted him in 1958 saying, \\"a purely psychological explanation is ruled out.\\" The flying saucers were real and \\"show signs of intelligent guidance and quasi-human pilots. I can only say for certain that these things are not a mere rumor, something has been seen. ...If the extraterrestrial origin of these phenomena should be confirmed, this would prove the existence of an intelligent interplanetary relationship. ... That the construction of these machines proves a scientific technique immensely superior to ours cannot be disputed.\\"Many newspapers, e.g., New York Herald Tribune, Stars and Stripes, July 30, 1958 Disciples of Jung have offered thoughtful rebuttals.Dennis Stillings, \\"What Did Carl Gustav Jung Believe about Flying Saucer?\\" in Dennis Stillings, ed., Cyberbiological Studies of the Imaginal Component in the UFO Contact Experience; Archaus, volume 5 (1989), Archaeus Project, 1989, pp. 33-50. Jung risibly complained about that 1958 newspaper piece for making him look like someone who believed ufos were physically real. \\"This report is altogether false.\\" Jung was completely uncommitted on the issue of whether they were real or unreal.C.G. Jung, Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies Bollingen Series: Princeton University Press, 1978, Passage # 1445 p. 136 He tried to set the record straight. \\"I was quoted as a saucer believer. I issued a statement to the United Press and gave a true version of my opinion, but this time the wire went dead: nobody, so far as I know, took any notice of it, except one German newspaper‚Ä¶ one must draw the conclusion that news affirming the existence of Ufos is welcome, but that skepticism seems to be undesirable. To believe that Ufos are real suits the general opinion, whereas disbelief is to be discouraged‚Ä¶ This remarkable fact in itself surely merits the psychologist's interest.\\"C.G. Jung, Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies Bollingen Series: Princeton University Press, 1978, Preface to the First English edition, pp. 3-4. ==See also== *Extraterrestrial hypothesis *Interdimensional hypothesis *Cultural tracking ==References== ==Further reading== * Abrassart, J-M (2011).

The noun Saulƒó/Saule in the Lithuanian and Latvian languages is also the conventional name for the Sun and originates from the Proto-Baltic name *SauliƒÅ > *Saulƒì.Baltic etymology ==Representation== Saulƒó is one of the most powerful deities, the goddess of life and fertility, warmth and health. She is patroness of the unfortunate, especially orphans. The Lithuanian and Latvian words for \\"the world\\" (pasaulis and pasaule) are translated as \\"[a place] under the Sun\\". Saulƒó is mentioned in one of the earliest written sources on Lithuanian mythology. According to the Slavic translation of the Chronicle by John Malalas (1261), a weak smith named Teliavelis made the Sun and threw it into the sky. Missionary Jerome of Prague (ca. 1369‚Äì1440) spent three years attempting to Christianize Lithuania and later recounted a myth about the kidnapped Saulƒó. She was held in a tower by a powerful king and rescued by the zodiac using a giant sledgehammer. Jerome swore that he personally witnessed the hammer, venerated by the locals. ==Family== A circa 1912 painting by Janis RozentƒÅls depicting the daughters of Saule (Saules meitas) Saulƒó and Mƒónuo/Mƒìness (the Moon) were wife and husband. Mƒónuo fell in love with Au≈°rinƒó (the morning star or Venus). For his infidelity, Perk≈´nas (thunder god) punished Mƒónuo. There are different accounts of the punishment. One version has it that Mƒónuo was cut into two pieces, but he did not learn from his mistakes and thus the punishment is repeated every month. Another version claims that Mƒónuo and Saulƒó divorced, but both wanted to see their daughter ≈Ωemyna (earth). That is why the Sun shines during the day, while the Moon visits at night. A third version claims that the face of Mƒónuo was disfigured by either Dievas (the supreme god) or Saulƒó. In other myths, Au≈°rinƒó is depicted as a daughter and servant of Saulƒó. Au≈°rinƒó lights the fire for Saulƒó and makes her ready for another day's journey across the sky. Vakarinƒó (the evening star) makes the bed for Saulƒó in the evening. In the Lithuanian mythology, Saulƒó was mother of other planets: Indraja (Jupiter), Sƒólija (Saturn), ≈Ωiezdrƒó (Mars), Vaivora (Mercury). ==Feasts== Saulƒó's feast was celebrated during the summer solstice. Lithuanian Rasos (turned into Saint Jonas' Festival by Christianity) and Latvian Lƒ´go (turned into JƒÅ≈Üi) involve making wreaths, looking for the magical fern flower, burning bonfires, dancing around and leaping over the fire, and greeting the Sun when it rises at around 4 am next morning. It is the most joyous traditional holiday. The winter solstice is celebrated as the return of Saulƒó. Christianity absorbed Lithuanian K≈´ƒçios and Latvian Ziemassvƒìtki into Christmas. Other celebrations took place around the equinoxes. ==See also== * List of solar deities * Proto-Indo-European mythology * Indo-European cosmogony * Baltic mythology * Lithuanian mythology * Prussian mythology * Latvian mythology ==References== Category:Lithuanian goddesses Category:Mother goddesses Category:Fertility goddesses Category:Solar goddesses Category:Childhood goddesses Category:Baltic goddesses Category:Latvian goddesses Category:Baltic gods ","title":"Saulƒó"},{"id":"824293","text":"Self portrait by Jean-Baptiste Regnault The Education of Achilles by Chiron the Centaur. 1782 (Louvre) Jean-Baptiste Regnault (9 October 1754 - 12 November 1829) was a French painter. ==Biography== Regnault was born in Paris, and began life at sea in a merchant vessel. At the age of fifteen his talent attracted attention, and he was sent to Italy by M. de Monval under the care of Bardin. After his return to Paris in 1776, Regnault won the Grand Prix for his painting Alexandre and Diog√®ne, and in 1783 he was elected to the French Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. His diploma picture, The Education of Achilles by Chiron the Centaur, is now in the Louvre, as also are his Trois Gr√¢ces, Le D√©luge, Descente de croix (Christ taken down from the Cross, originally executed for the royal chapel at Fontainebleau) and Socrate arrachant Alcibiade du sein de la Volupt√©. His L'origine de la peinture and L'origine de la sculpture, ou Pygmalion amoureux de sa statue are now at the Palace of Versailles. Besides various small pictures and allegorical subjects, Regnault was also the author of many large historical paintings; and his school, which reckoned amongst its chief attendants Gu√©rin, Crepin, Lafitte, Blondel, Robert Lef√®vre, Henriette Lorimier and Alexandre Menjaud, was for a long while the rival in influence of that of David.

The essay was first published in American Biology Teacher in 1973.; reprinted in Dobzhansky first used the title statement, in a slight variation, in a 1964 presidential address to the American Society of Zoologists, \\"Biology, Molecular and Organismic\\", to assert the importance of organismic biology in response to the challenge of the rising field of molecular biology.. The phrase appears on page 449 as \\"nothing makes sense in biology except in the light of evolution, sub specie evolutionis.\\" The term \\"light of evolution\\"‚Äîor sub specie evolutionis‚Äîhad been used earlier by the Jesuit priest and paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and then by the biologist Julian Huxley. == Overview == Dobzhansky opens with a critique of Shaikh Abdul Aziz bin Baz, the then Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, for holding a belief based on scripture that the Sun revolves around the Earth. Dobzhansky asserts that \\"it is ludicrous to mistake the Bible and the Koran for primers of natural science. They treat of matters even more important: the meaning of man and his relations to God.\\" He then criticizes the early English antievolutionist Philip Henry Gosse ‚Äì who had proposed that fossils were created in the places where they were found ‚Äì for blasphemously implying that God is deceitful. As he had said in his earlier presidential address, \\"If the living world has not arisen from common ancestors by means of an evolutionary process, then the fundamental unity of living things is a hoax and their diversity is a joke.\\" These two themes of the unity of living things and the diversity of life provide central themes for his essay. Dobzhansky used the example of the adaptive radiation of Drosophila fruit flies (blue arrows) on Hawaii. Addressing the diversity of life on Earth, Dobzhansky asks whether God was joking when he created different species for different environments. This diversity becomes reasonable and understandable, however, if Creation takes place not by the whim of the Creator \\"but by evolution propelled by natural selection.\\" He further illustrates this diversity from his own investigation of the widely diverse range of species of fruit flies in Hawaii. Either the Creator, \\"in a fit of absent mindedness,\\" created many species of fruit flies in Hawaii, or the fruit flies that arrived on the islands, diversified to fill a wide range of vacant ecological niches. He illustrates the unity of living things using the molecular sequence of cytochrome C, which Emanuel Margoliash and Walter M. Fitch had shown to be similar in a wide range of species, including monkeys, tuna, kangaroos, and yeast. This unity is further illustrated by the similarity of the embryos of different species. Either God deliberately arranged things \\"to mislead sincere seekers of truth\\" or these similarities are the result of evolution. Dobzhansky concludes that scripture and science are two different things: \\"It is a blunder to mistake the Holy Scriptures for elementary textbooks of astronomy, geology, biology, and anthropology.\\" One response to this paper was a paper by Stephen Dilley, \\"Nothing in biology makes sense except in light of theology?\\". This argued that Dobzhansky's arguments all \\"hinge[d] upon sectarian claims about God‚Äôs nature, actions, purposes, or duties\\"‚Äîclaims that in Dilley's view required more justification and appeared mutually incompatible. == The underlying theme == The underlying theme of the essay is the need to teach biological evolution in the context of debate about creation and evolution in public education in the United States. The fact that evolution occurs explains the interrelatedness of the various facts of biology, and so makes biology make sense. The concept has become firmly established as a unifying idea in biology education. == The phrase == The notion of the \\"light of evolution\\" came originally from the vitalist Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, whom Dobzhansky much admired. In the last paragraph of the article, Dobzhansky quotes from de Chardin's 1955 The Phenomenon of Man: :(Evolution) general condition to which all theories, all hypotheses, all systems must bow and which they must satisfy henceforward if they are to be thinkable and true. Evolution is a light which illuminates all facts, a curve that all lines must follow. (p. 219 of The Phenomenon of Man) The phrase \\"nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\\" has come into common use by those opposing creationism or its variant called intelligent design.Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District ‚Äì Context: 1. An Objective Observer Would Know that ID and Teaching About \\"Gaps\\" and \\"Problems\\" in Evolutionary Theory are Creationist, Religious Strategies that Evolved from Earlier Forms of Creationism While the essay argues (following de Chardin) that Christianity and evolutionary biology are compatible, a position described as evolutionary creationism or theistic evolution, the phrase is also used by those who consider that \\"in biology\\" includes anthropology, and those who consider a creator to be unnecessary, such as Richard Dawkins who published The Selfish Gene just three years later. == Quotations == ==References== == External links == * PDF as published by The American Biology Teacher, Vol. 35, No. 3 (Mar., 1973) Category:1973 essays Category:Evolution and religion Category:Evolutionary biology literature Category:Works originally published in American magazines ","title":"Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution"},{"id":"824318","text":"Nils Schumann (born 20 May 1978) is a former German athlete, winner of the 800 m at the 2000 Summer Olympics, who retired in 2009.http://www.marathonscene.com/germany/news/former-olympic-800m-champion- nils-schumann-retires_2009/ For most of the five years before his retirement he had featured sparingly at an international level due to injuries. Schumann, born in Bad Frankenhausen, began his career as a footballer in 1984 before switching to athletics. He won a gold medal over 800 m at the 1998 European Athletics Indoor Championships in Valencia. At the European Championships in Budapest in the same year, he won the title in a close finish. A few weeks later he also won the 800 m race at the World Cup in Johannesburg. He also made the final of the 1999 World Athletics Championships, but placed 8th and last. He had a quiet 2000 season, until the Olympics started in Sydney. Schumann cruised through the preliminaries, easily qualifying for the final. In the final, Schumann set in his final sprint at the last straight, taking the lead with just 50 m to go. Favourite Wilson Kipketer of Denmark gained in the closing meters, but was unable to prevent a surprise victory by the German runner. In the following year, Schumann finished in fifth place at the 2001 World Championships in Athletics in Edmonton. Schumann, who also won a bronze medal at the 2002 European Championships, was unable to defend his Olympic title at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, suffering from injury throughout the 2004 season. ==Competition record== { - !colspan=\\"6\\"Representing - 1996 World Junior Championships Sydney, Australia 5th 800 m 1:49.44 - 1997 European Junior Championships Ljubljana, Slovenia bgcolor=gold1st 800 m 1:51.00 - rowspan=31998 European Indoor Championships Valencia, Spain bgcolor=gold1st 800 m 1:47.02 - European Championships Budapest, Hungary bgcolor=gold1st 800 m 1:44.89 - World Cup Johannesburg, South Africa bgcolor=gold1st 800 m 1:48.66 - rowspan=31999 rowspan=2European U23 Championships rowspan=2Gothenburg, Sweden bgcolor=gold1st 800m 1:45.21 - bgcolor=gold1st 4 √ó 400 m relay 3:02.96 - World Championships Seville, Spain 8th 800 m 1:46.79 - rowspan=22000 European Indoor Championships Ghent, Belgium bgcolor=cc99663rd 800 m 1:48.41 - Olympic Games Sydney, Australia bgcolor=gold1st 800 m 1:45.08 - 2001 World Championships Edmonton, Canada 5th 800 m 1:45.00 - rowspan=22002 European Championships Munich, Germany bgcolor=cc99663rd 800 m 1:47.60 - World Cup Madrid, Spain 5th 800 m 1:45.34 } ==Beyond retirement== On 3 March 2008 Schumann married the 400 meter runner Korinna Fink.leichtathletik.de: Nils Schumann im Hafen der Ehe, 3.

It was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1994. An announcement in the back of one edition of Earth is for a novel titled Stratos, to be released in the spring of 1992. It seems likely that this was delayed, and renamed Glory Season. ==Plot summary== Three thousand years before the story starts, Lysos founds a human colony on the isolated planet of Stratos in an effort to radically re- engineer human life into a happier, more pastoral form. She developed a strain of human beings that conceives clones in winter (always female), while those conceived in summer (variants or \\"vars\\") obtain their genes through sexual reproduction just in case biological adaptation becomes necessary. Further, males and females have opposed seasons of sexual receptivity: men in summer and women in winter. This scheme is said to be stable over evolutionary time because women gain an advantage from self-cloning, while men only reproduce in summer. Finally, men have been made far less aggressive during the times that they are less sexually receptive and are much less numerous. The social result is that the vast majority of the population of Stratos consists of groups of female clones, each in its own social or economic niche. Over the centuries, these groups have come to dominate society. Men are confined to relatively few professions (such as sailing) and have a lower social status than clones, but higher than vars. In each generation, a few women vars become successful enough to found their own clan or \\"hive\\" of clones. As is customary, clones are trained to carry on their clan's business, while vars leave as young adults to seek their fortune. It is time for identical twins Maia and Leie to enter the outside world. They plan to work as sailors to gain experience and explore Stratos, find their niche, and found a clan. Almost immediately, they hit a snag. The only two ship's captains willing to take them on at that time insist they split up, because they cannot have it appear to their clone passengers that clones are doing lowly ship's work. The ships are traveling together. Aboard, Maia meets Naroin, a highly competent female bosun's mate. Later, Leie's ship is lost in a storm. Maia is heartbroken and seriously injured, but eventually recuperates and finds a job on a railroad. On the railroad, Maia discovers her var temporary assistant is actually a clone courier and courtesan running illegal drugs. The drugs are designed to shift a man's period of sexual interest. They are part of a plot by reactionary \\"Perkinites\\" (named after Charlotte Perkins Gilman, author of Herland) to minimize the role of men in an isolated valley, and perhaps later all of Stratos. Maia notifies the \\"Planetary Equilibrium Authority\\", but is kidnapped and imprisoned by the Perkinites. She discovers that Renna, a prisoner in another cell, is transmitting messages electrically. She talks with Renna by code and develops a friendship with her unseen fellow inmate. When she discovers that Renna is being transferred somewhere else, Maia engineers her escape, only to find that idealistic radicals (\\"rads\\") and their allies have already freed Renna, who is actually the \\"Visitor,\\" a male envoy from the rest of humanity whose arrival has triggered great debate among the leaders of Stratos as to how to respond to the renewed - and unwanted - contact. She tags along with Renna and the rads. A platonic friendship develops between Renna and Maia. Their group, which includes Naroin, is later overtaken at sea by pirates (pirating being a tolerated, legal activity). During the ensuing boarding fight, Maia is shocked when she encounters her sister, one of the pirates. The pirates win, with the help of traitors planted in the rads' group. They strand many of their female prisoners, including Maia and Naroin, and one young male sailor named Brod on a deserted island and take Renna, their prize, to a secret base. After the castaways manage to ambush pirates sent to eliminate all witnesses, they sail off to alert the authorities, but Maia, accompanied only by Brod, sets out to try to rescue Renna. They inadvertently stumble upon the pirate base. While secretly reconnoitering it, Maia helps free more prisoners, including the rads and the crew of her ship. She also learns that Renna has somehow escaped. More fighting breaks out when their enemies learn the rest of their prisoners are loose. In the turmoil, Maia and her allies are cornered, but she finds a secret exit which leads to the long-lost \\"Jellicoe Former\\", an advanced manufacturing facility that can produce anything. Renna is killed when the spaceship he found and completed at Jellicoe Former explodes soon after its launch. Maia is severely injured in the battle. The police and other interested parties arrive to save the survivors of Maia's side. While recuperating, Maia is dragged into politics and kept a prisoner discreetly by one clan because she has become a symbol. She tells her story to a group of male heads of sailing clans. One of them turns out to be the father she had never known. For her actions, they offer her \\"clan\\" an alliance. At the end, with Renna dead, Maia becomes an embarrassment to her captors, so she is allowed to walk away free. She decides that she will not found a clan of clones, but rather have offspring the old way. ==Major themes== The nature of the novel is a subject of some contention, some believing that the setting is a feminist utopia, others holding it to be a dystopian work functioning as a post-feminist critique of feminism. The structure of the society is complex enough to make either interpretation possible, though the society's origin and structure is based on an extreme of separatist feminism. Also, the structure of the society as seen within the narrative supports the view of biological determinism when it comes to the relationship between genetics and gender roles. The author, in the novel's afterword, explains that the idea for the society in which the story takes place originated from a study of reproductive cycle of aphids, which is heterogamous. Aphids alternate between asexual reproduction in the Summer, i.e., when the environment is favorable and there is plenty of food, and sexually in the Fall when the organism is stressed by its environment. This has the biological advantage of ensuring identical copies of the parent will be well suited to take advantage of the favorable conditions, and variation in offspring in a stressful environment in hopes some of the offspring will find the environment favorable, even when the parents do not. The entire social construct in the novel is therefore an extrapolation of this idea onto a human culture, where successful female clans (female, because only they can produce offspring) can take advantage of their sociological niches by producing exact copies, and unsuccessful females produce variable offspring sexually. One could argue that successful human organizations such as the clans require a variety of personality types and individuals of complementary skill sets to be successful as an organization. While this criticism is not directly addressed, it might act as a limiter on how large a particular clan could grow, since inevitably a large organizational structure would require specialization of tasks for which none of the clan members may be suited. ==See also== * , the inspiration for the game called Life in the book * Virgin Planet ‚Äì an SF novel by Poul Anderson where a male explorer stumbles across a lost planet of all women who reproduce by cloning themselves ==References== ==External links== * Glory Season at Worlds Without End Category:1993 novels Category:1993 science fiction novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Cellular automata in popular culture Category:Novels by David Brin ","title":"Glory Season"},{"id":"824336","text":"Phantasmagoria is a type of horror show using an optical device to display moving images.

The bridge is known to have existed since at least 1375 and the current brick bridge was opened in 1892, replacing a series of wooden bridges. It gave its name to the nearby Upminster Bridge tube station, which opened in 1934, and has also been applied to the neighbourhood around the station in the London Borough of Havering. ==Etymology== The bridge has been alternatively known as Bridge House Bridge and Lower Bridge, with Bridge House referring to a house which stood nearby on the current site of Hornchurch Stadium. The placename Upminster is first recorded in 1062 as Upmynstre and is recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book. It is formed from Old English upp and mynster, possibly meaning the large church on high ground, above the valley of the Ingrebourne. However, it may also indicate the position of an Anglo-Saxon minster secondary to those at Barking or Tilbury.Blair, John (2005). The Church in Anglo-Saxon Society. Oxford University Press. p. 102. ==History== The bridge has existed since at least 1375. It is recorded in 1617 as being in need of repair. The River Ingrebourne formed the boundary between the ancient parishes of Hornchurch and Upminster. However, upkeep of all bridges over the river were the responsibility of the Upminster parish authorities, as Hornchurch claimed exception due to the charter of the Royal Liberty of Havering. The wooden bridge was destroyed and replaced with another after the winter of 1709/10. Replacement wooden carriage bridges were constructed in 1759 and 1827 and an adjacent ford was in use up until the 19th century. A stone and brick structure was completed in 1892 and contains a time capsule. The significance of the boundary was reduced in 1934 when both sides became part of Hornchurch Urban District. Upminster Bridge tube station opened in 1934. Until its last replacement with railings in the 1980s by Havering London Borough Council, the bridge used to have two low height cast-iron plated bridge sides that were cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, makers of Big Ben and other bells in the Houses of Parliament. A nearby pub used to bear the name The Bridge House but is now called The Windmill, after a brief period being the Hungry Horse. ==Geography== The area is split between the Hornchurch and Upminster post towns. However, the post town boundary does not follow the line of the river, instead deviating from it at Hacton Bridge, following the Fenchurch Street‚ÄìSouthend railway line to Berkeley Close and then realigning to the river at Upminster Golf Course. This causes three streets east of the Ingrebourne to be in the Hornchurch post town and twelve streets west of the river to be in the Upminster post town. The street names Bridge Avenue, Boundary Road, Hornminster Glen and Minster Way allude the nature of the location as a boundary between places. ==Transport== It is the location of Upminster Bridge tube station. The area is served by the 193, 248 and 370 bus routes, with services to Cranham, Romford, Upminster and Lakeside. The London Loop key walking route passes through the Upminster Bridge area, and the station forms the end point of section 22 from Harold Wood and the starting point of section 23 to Rainham. Until 1972, bus routes on the A124 road that crosses the narrow bridge were more numerous. Before 248 was extended from its orbital run around Upminster Park Estate to connect into Romford town centre, the London Transport buses reaching Upminster station were the 193 and the 86. The latter running all the way from Bow and Limehouse the 15 or so miles to Upminster most of the time hugging the course of the A124 road. ==References== ==External links== *Hidden London - Upminster Bridge Category:Areas of London Category:Districts of the London Borough of Havering ","title":"Upminster Bridge"},{"id":"824388","text":"Francis V, Duke of Modena, Reggio and Guastalla, Archduke of Austria-Este, Royal Prince of Hungary and Bohemia, Duke of Mirandola and of Massa, Prince of Carrara (; 1 June 1819 ‚Äì 20 November 1875) was a reigning prince. He was Duke of Modena, Reggio, and Mirandola, Duke of Guastalla from 1847 and Duke of Massa and Prince of Carrara from 1846 to 1859. His parents were Francis IV of Modena and Princess Maria Beatrice of Savoy. He was the last reigning Duke of Modena before the duchy was incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy. ==Life and legacy== Obelisk erected in Reggio Emilia to celebrate the marriage of the Duke with Princess Adelgunde of Bavaria Francis was baptised 5 days after birth by the local archbishop in the local cathedral; Emperor Franz I of Austria, the former Holy Roman Emperor, acted as his godfather, but his uncle Archduke Ferdinand acted as proxy for the emperor. In 1826 Francis IV of Modena appointed Count Clemente Coronini as tutor to Francis, with Don Pietro Raffaelli, who would later become Bishop of Carpi and Reggio, as his assistant. In 1829, Baron Ernest Geramb became Francis' new tutor. On 15 September 1836, Francis became a Knight of the Austrian Order of the Golden Fleece, and 3 years later he received the Grand Cordon of the Dutch Order of the Lion. After the death of his mother in 1840, Francis was considered the legitimate heir to the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland by Jacobites as Francis I. At his death his younger brother‚Äôs daughter Maria Theresia of Austria-Este became Jacobite claimant. Francis V, Duke of Modena. On 30 March 1842, Francis married Princess Adelgunde of Bavaria, daughter of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, in the Allerheiligen-Hofkirche at the Munich Residenz. The Archbishop of Munich-Freising was the chief witness to the wedding. The couple had only one child, Princess Anna Beatrice (19 October 1848 in Gries, Bolzano ‚Äì 8 July 1849 in Modena). In 1842, Francis received another order: the Savoy Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation. At the death of his father Francis IV of Modena on 21 January 1846, Francis succeeded as reigning Duke of Modena. As member of a cadet branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine he also bore the titles of an Archduke of Austria and a Prince Royal of Hungary and Bohemia from birth; from his father he inherited also the title of Duke of Reggio and Mirandola, Duke of Massa, Prince of Carrara and Lunigiana. At the death of his cousin the Empress Marie-Louise on 18 December 1847, he succeeded as Duke of Guastalla. During the revolutions of 1848, Francis was forced to flee his Duchy by a popular uprising and was restored by Austrian troops in the following year. In 1855, Francis established his own new order: the Order of the Eagle of Este, of which he acted as Grand Master. In 1859 the Duchy of Modena was invaded by armies of France and Piedmont. On 14 June, Francis fled. On 18 March 1860, King Victor Emanuel II of Sardinia ordered Modena to be incorporated into the new kingdom of Italy. Francis protested against this four days later. After the loss of his duchy, Francis withdrew to Vienna, where he lived in the Palais Modena. He also had a summer residence at Schloss Wildenwart in Bavaria. Although he spent most of his time in Austria he occasionally traveled and in 1864 he visited the Middle East. On 7 March 1861, William Ewart Gladstone, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, made a verbal attack against Francis. Later Lord Derby and Constantine Phipps, Marquis of Normanby discovered that Gladstone's accusation had been entirely false. Francis died at Vienna on 20 November 1875. He left most of his huge estate to his 1st cousin twice removed Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, who subsequently used the title Archduke of Austria-Este. His remains were kept at the Capuchin Church in Vienna. ==Ancestors== On a note of rarity, Francis shared the same birthday with his paternal grandfather/maternal great- grandfather, Ferdinand of Austria-Este. ==References== *Giornale della Reale Ducale Brigata Estense, Ristampa anastatica Aedes Muratoriana, Modena 1977 *Gian Carlo Montanari, I Fedelissimi del Duca ‚Äì La Brigata Estense, Edizioni il Fiorino, Modena 1995 *Elena Bianchini Braglia, In esilio con il Duca, Il Cerchio Iniziative Editoriali, Rimini 2007. *Nicola Guerra, \\"I filoestensi apuani durante il processo di unita' nazionale\\" in Rassegna storica Toscana, 2003 ==External links== * Category:1819 births Category:1875 deaths Category:House of Habsburg Category:Austria-Este Category:Austrian princes Category:Dukes of Italy Category:Dukes of Modena Category:Hereditary Princes of Modena Category:Modenese princes Category:Dukes of Reggio Category:Dukes of Massa Category:Dukes of Guastalla Francis 1 Category:Roman Catholic monarchs Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Austria Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Joseph Category:Grand Crosses of the Saxe-Ernestine House Order Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Ludwigsorden ","title":"Francis V, Duke of Modena"},{"id":"824396","text":"The Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope or JKT is a 1-metre optical telescope named for the Dutch astronomer Jacobus Kapteyn( 1851-1922) of the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma in the Canary Islands, Spain.

He had been a barrister-at-law in his home-country Australia when he joined the judiciary of Hong Kong in 1965 as a magistrate in the Lands Tribunal. Since then, he had been successively promoted as President of the Lands Tribunal, a puisne judge of the Supreme Court and Vice-President of the Court of Appeal. In 1996, he became acting Chief Justice of the Supreme Court when Sir Ti-liang Yang resigned and contested for the first ever election of the Chief Executive. After the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from Britain to People's Republic of China in 1997, he was appointed Vice-President of the Court of Appeal of the High Court. He retired from the High Court in 1999 but remained as a non-permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal. Sir Noel was honoured with a knighthood and a Gold Bauhinia Star in 1999 by the British monarch and the Government of Hong Kong respectively. He chaired an independent inquiry to probe into the opinion poll scandal of the University of Hong Kong in 2000. In 2005, he was one of the presiding judges of the Court of Final Appeal who heard the inheritance dispute between local tycoon Nina Wang and her old-aged father-in-law. In his later years, Sir Noel was a judge of the Court of Appeal of Brunei Darussalam and was appointed President in 2007. He died in office in 2009. ==BiographyEarly years=== Power was born on 4 December 1929 in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, to a locally renowned family of Irish descent. His grandfather, the Hon. Francis Isidore Power (1852‚Äì1912), was a member of the Legislative Council of Queensland; his great-uncle, Virgil Power, (1849‚Äì1914) was a judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland. Noel was the middle child among his siblings with an elder brother and younger sister. His parents were John Joseph Power, a doctor in the Australian Army and once the president of the Queensland Turf Club, and Hilda Power.\\"Sir Noel Plunkett Power \\", Supreme Court of Queensland Library, retrieved on 24 November 2009. In his early years, Noel Power was educated at Downlands College, Toowoomba, Queensland. After that he read law and studied literature at the University of Queensland where he was a member of the winning team in the Inter-Varsity Debating Competition. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and LL.B degrees from the university.Who's Who. London: A & C Black, 2008. ===Judicial career=== Shortly after graduation, Power was called to the bars of the High Court of Australia and Supreme Court of Queensland in 1955, where he began his career as a barrister-at-law. In 1965, he moved to Hong Kong and became a magistrate of the Lands Tribunal. He managed to get promoted as President of the Lands Tribunal in 1976. In this capacity, he had compiled the Lands Tribunal Law Reports for three consecutive years, before getting promoted again as a puisne judge of the Supreme Court in 1979. During serving in the Supreme Court, Power was appointed by the government in 1984 to chair the Broadcasting Review Board. Under his chairmanship, the committee published a report in 1985 which resulted in the establishment of the Broadcasting Authority in 1987. In 1987, Power became a judge of the Court of Appeal, a post he had held until 1993 when he was appointed Vice-President of the Court of Appeal. From 1994 to 1997, he was also the chairman of the editorial board of the Hong Kong Law Reports. In 1996, Power was appointed acting Chief Justice of the Supreme Court when Sir Ti-liang Yang resigned and contested for the election of the Chief Executive. He did not hold the post for long and was soon succeeded by Andrew Li as Chief Justice of the Court of Final Appeal immediately after the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong from Britain to the People's Republic of China in 1997. The end of British rule bought many changes to the judicature of Hong Kong. A Court of Final Appeal was set up to replace the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and the Supreme Court was renamed the High Court, and Power was appointed a non- permanent judge of the Court of Final Appeal in addition to his original post as Vice-President of the Court of Appeal. Justice Power retired from the Court of Appeal in July 1999 but continued to serve in the Court of Final Appeal. In 2005, he was one of the judges of the Court of Final Appeal who heard the inheritance dispute between local business tycoon, Nina Wang, and her old aged father-in-law. The case was one of the longest civil trials in the legal history of Hong Kong. The court finally overturned the previous High Court rulings and found in favour of Nina Wang. To mark his contribution to the judiciary of Hong Kong, Power was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the Queen's Birthday Honours of 1999. He received the knighthood in person from Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace in the same year. Also in 1999, the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region awarded him the Gold Bauhinia Star, the second-highest honour the Chief Executive can bestow. In 2000, an opinion poll scandal emerged in the University of Hong Kong when the Director of the university's Public Opinion Programme (POP), Dr Robert Chung, revealed to the local media that he was pressured by then Chief Executive, Tung Chee Hwa, through a third person that he must stop conducting public opinion polls on the popularity of the Chief Executive and the government. The scandal aroused critical debate in Hong Kong that the then Pro-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong, Sir Ti-liang Yang, was compelled to set up an independent inquiry panel. Justice Power was then appointed to chair the panel while other members of the inquiry were Ronny Wong Fook- hum, former Chairman of the Bar Association, and Pamela Chan, former Chief Executive of the Consumer Council.„ÄàÊ¢ÅÊåØËã±ÔºöÊ∏ØÂ§ßÂïèÈ°åÊ∏ØÂ§ßËß£Ê±∫„ÄâÔºå„ÄäÊòüÂ≥∂Á∂≤Êñ∞ËÅûÂõûÈ°ß„ÄãÔºå2000Âπ¥7Êúà27Êó•„ÄÇ In the 76-page report later published by the inquiry, all three members concurred in concluding that the Senior Special Assistant to the Chief Executive, Andrew Lo Cheung-on, did attempt to influence the Public Opinion Programme. The report finally resulted in the resignations of the then Vice-Chancellor, Prof Cheng Yiu-chung, and Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Prof Wong Siu-lun, of the university. ===Later years=== Since 1980, Power had already served as visiting judge to Brunei Darussalam on several occasions. After retiring from the Court of Appeal of Hong Kong in 1999, he was appointed a judge of the Court of Appeal of Brunei Darussalam in 2003, and became President of the Court of Appeal of Brunei Darussalam in 2007. Power resided in Australia in his final years but kept travelling frequently to hear cases in Brunei. Despite declining health, he managed to work through the legal year of 2009 in Brunei. ===Death=== On 19 November 2009, he suddenly suffered a heart attack and was sent to the Jerudong Park Medical Centre in Brunei. He died on the same day in the medical centre, while he was still in office, aged 79.\\"President Of Brunei Court Of Appeal Passes Away\\", BruDirect.COM, 21 November 2009. The death of Justice Power was grieved by the Law Society of Brunei Darussalam and Chief Justice of Hong Kong, Andrew Li. In his statement, Chief Justice Li particularly praised him as \\"one of the most outstanding Judges to have served Hong Kong in recent decades. He was an outstanding lawyer and his judgments have provided authoritative guidance in many areas, particularly in the criminal field.\\"\\"Former top judge, Sir Noel Power, dies \\", RTHK News, 20 November 2009.

They moved to Hong Kong soon after their marriage. The couple had two sons and one daughter. Sir Noel's hobbies included travelling, reading, and cooking and wine tasting. From 1984 to 1999 he was the Chairman of Hong Kong Island of the International Food and Wine Society. From 1994 to 1999 he was Chairman of Asia-Pacific Zone and from 1999 to 2009 was Chairman of Gold Coast of the same society. Sir Noel found the Wines of the Pacific Rim Fair in Hong Kong in 1988.

The character was originally called Ghost Rider, and was renamed following the introduction of Marvel's motorcycle-riding character called Ghost Rider. He was played by Sam Elliott in the 2007 film Ghost Rider, as an amalgamation of Carter Slade and Caretaker. ==Publication history== Marvel's first Ghost Rider look was based on the Magazine Enterprises character Ghost Rider (Rex Fury), created by writer Ray Krank and artist Dick Ayers for editor Vincent Sullivan in Tim Holt #11 (1949). The character appeared in horror-themed Western stories through the run of Tim Holt, Red Mask, and A-1 Comics up until the institution of the Comics Code.Ghost Rider (Magazine Enterprises) at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on December 8, 2015. After the trademark to the character's name and motif lapsed, Marvel Comics debuted its own near-identical, horror-free version of the character in Ghost Rider #1 (cover-dated Feb. 1967), by writers Roy Thomas and Gary Friedrich and original Ghost Rider artist Ayers. The song \\"(Ghost) Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend\\", being popular at the time, inspired the comics. The song was also the inspiration for the Magazine Enterprises' horror-Western comic-book character the Ghost Rider. Co-creator Dick Ayers recalled that editor Vin Sullivan \\"describe[d] what he wanted in the Ghost Rider\\" and told Ayers to see the 1949 Disney animated feature The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, one segment of which adapted Washington Irving's story \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\", featuring the Headless Horseman. \\"[A]nd then he told me to play the Vaughn Monroe record \\"(Ghost) Riders in the Sky\\".

At least five men have been the Phantom Rider, one of whom is active in the modern day. The Magazine Enterprises library of characters, including its version of Ghost Rider, was reprinted by AC Comics in the 1980s. While the copyrights have lapsed due to non-renewal, AC renamed the Ghost Rider as the Haunted Horseman, due to Marvel having maintained the Ghost Rider trademark. ==Fictional character biographyCarter Slade=== Carter Slade, the first to wear the mask, debuted in Ghost Rider #1 (Feb. 1967). He battled evil while dressed in a phosphorescent white costume, complete with a full-face mask, cape, and the requisite white hat. Slade received his outfit and his white horse from Flaming Star, a Native American medicine man. He was never called the Phantom Rider in these original appearances. In Marvel continuity, it was not until after Slade's death that the name Phantom Rider was given to the character, and reprints now retroactively use that name for Slade. Eventually, the modern era Ghost Rider Johnny Blaze found himself transported into the 19th century where he met and teamed up with Carter Slade. Carter was badly wounded and Blaze took him to Flaming Star to be healed and then dealt with Carter's enemies. Carter recovered and Johnny returned to the present.Ghost Rider vol. 2, #50 Carter Slade's spirit, however, returned and possessed his descendant Hamilton Slade to make him a new Phantom Rider and rode out to rescue Johnny Blaze from certain doom.Ghost Rider vol. 2, #56 ===Jamie Jacobs=== After Slade's death in Western Gunfighters #7 (Jan. 1972), his sidekick Jamie Jacobs became the second Phantom Rider. He was soon killed in action.Western Gunfighters #7 (Jan. 1972) ===Lincoln Slade=== Lincoln Slade is Carter Slade's brother and a U.S. Marshal, as well as the third Phantom Rider.Western Gunfighters #7 (Jan. 1972) Lincoln was driven insane by his powers. When the West Coast Avengers are traveling through time on one of their adventures, Lincoln becomes infatuated with one of their members, Mockingbird. Lincoln kidnapped the Avenger and fled to a secret location. He then drugs Mockingbird, removing her ability to give or deny consent, and rapes her. Once the effects of the drugs wear off, an enraged Mockingbird fights and defeats him. In the course of the battle he is knocked over a cliff. As he clings to the cliffside, he first pleads with Mockingbird to help him, then attempts to reassert his hypnotic authority and orders her to help him. Hating him for his violation of her, Mockingbird allows him to fall to his death.West Coast Avengers vol. 2, #18-23 (Aug. 1987) Years later, Lincoln's restless spirit possesses his descendant, Hamilton Slade, to seek \\"vengeance\\" against Mockingbird.Hawkeye & Mockingbird #1 His spirit returns a second time in order to make Mockingbird return his feelings.Mockingbird Vol. 1, Issue #6-7 Comic Book Resources placed him as one of the superheroes Marvel wants you to forget. ===Reno Jones=== In the miniseries Blaze of Glory, the African American gunslinger Reno Jones used the Ghost Rider identity briefly in a battle with the Klan-affiliated mercenaries called the Nightriders. Jones was one-half of the team called the Gunhawks, along with his former friend, Kid Cassidy, whom Jones had believed dead. Cassidy was revealed to be alive and the leader of the Nightriders; he was killed, and Jones retired.Blaze of Glory: The Last Ride of the Western Heroes #3‚Äì4 ===Hamilton Slade=== In present-day continuity, Lincoln Slade's distant descendant Hamilton Slade was an archaeologist who found the burial site of his legendary ancestor, in issue #56 of the supernatural-motorcyclist series Ghost Rider. As he explored the site, he found a large burial urn and from it appeared the ghostly garb of his ancestors Carter and Lincoln Slade. Possessed by the spirits of his ancestors, he became the new version of the Phantom Rider, and rode off to rescue Johnny Blaze, the current Ghost Rider, from one of his foes.Ghost Rider #56 However, he would have no memory of his adventures as the Rider and eventually Lincoln's ghost would takeover more frequently and haunt Mockingbird for his death.West Coast Avengers #31 An exorcism released the spirits of Carter and Lincoln from Hamilton and Lincoln was defeated and banished while Hamilton agreed to have Carter possess him, only now Hamilton was in control and retained memory of his adventures as the Rider.West Coast Avengers #41 Hamilton attempted a similar exorcism to save his daughter Jaime from the returning spirit of Lincoln Slade. He was killed by Crossfire as the exorcism was being completed.Hawkeye & Mockingbird #4‚Äì5 ===J. T. Slade=== Nick Fury recruits Carter Slade's grandson, James Taylor Slade (also known as J. T. Slade), introduced in The Mighty Avengers #13, to be part of Fury's team against the \\"Secret Invasion\\" of the shape-shifting alien Skrulls. He has superhuman reflexes and the ability to cause a chain to ignite in flame and cause massive damage.Secret Invasion #3 The character roll call at the beginning of Secret Invasion #4 (Sept. 2008) refers to J. T. as \\"Hellfire\\". Hellfire goes on to make numerous appearances in the ongoing series, Secret Warriors. In Secret Warriors #16, he is revealed to be a HYDRA double agent.Secret Warriors #16 Nick Fury allows Hellfire to fall to his death as a result of the character's double dealings.Secret Warriors #22 ===Jaime Slade=== In the 2010 series Hawkeye & Mockingbird, it is revealed that Hamilton Slade had a daughter named Jaime Slade. While she was examining an urn belonging to the Slade family estate, Lincoln Slade's spirit possessed her, transforming Jaime into the new Phantom Rider. Claiming to be both \\"the spirit and the heir\\", the Phantom Rider teamed up with Crossfire to battle the heroes Hawkeye and Mockingbird. Jaime's father, Hamilton Slade, attempted an exorcism which would rid his daughter of the possessing spirit. Hamilton was successful, but was killed by Crossfire as the exorcism had been completed. Jaime regained her senses to see Mockingbird stand over her father's dead body and believed the Avenger was responsible. Despite having Lincoln's spirit vanquished from her, Jaime transformed back into the Phantom Rider and attacked Mockingbird. She was defeated and taken into custody.Hawkeye & Mockingbird #1‚Äì5 ==In other mediaFilm=== * Actor Sam Elliott plays Texas Ranger Carter Slade (credited as the \\"Caretaker\\") in the 2007 film Ghost Rider. ===Television=== * A variation of Phantom Rider appears in Ultimate Spider-Man vs. The Sinister 6.

For a gas, n^2 \\\\approx 1, so the molar refractivity can be approximated by :A = \\\\frac{R T}{p} \\\\frac{n^2 - 1}{3}. In SI units, R has units of J mol‚àí1 K‚àí1, T has units K, n has no units, and p has units of Pa, so the units of A are m3 mol‚àí1. In terms of density œÅ, molecular weight M, it can be shown that: :A = \\\\frac{M}{\\\\rho} \\\\frac{n^2 - 1}{n^2 + 2} \\\\approx \\\\frac{M}{\\\\rho} \\\\frac{n^2 - 1}{3}. ==References== * Born, Max, and Wolf, Emil, Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light (7th ed.), section 2.3.3, Cambridge University Press (1999) Category:Physical chemistry Category:Physical optics ","title":"Molar refractivity"},{"id":"824439","text":"INT may refer to: * abbreviation for interjection * Telecom & Management SudParis, formerly Institut National des T√©l√©communications (INT), a French higher education institute * Telecom SudParis, formerly Telecom INT, a French grande ecole, graduate school for engineers * Telecom Business School, formerly INT Management, a French Grande Ecole, graduate business school * Smith Reynolds Airport, Winston-Salem, North Carolina * The Israel National Trail, a hiking trail that crosses Israel * The Indian National Theatre, a theatre organisation and troupe based in Mumbai, India * an interception in American football statistics * The Interstate Railroad, A former US railroad. * Int Base, the headquarters of the Church of Scientology ==Mathematics and science== * int(S) means the interior of set S * \`\\\\int\`, the LaTeX command that produces integral symbols * INT (chemical), a synthetic dye * Isaac Newton Telescope, an optical telescope in the Canary Islands ==Computing== * \`int\`, short for integer in many programming languages * shorthand for interrupt * abbreviation for internationalization * INT (x86 instruction), an assembly language instruction for the x86 architecture for generating a software interrupt * .int, a generic top-level domain (gTLD) * INT - Interactive software development environment.

It is a process of the dorsal body cavity. This canal is enclosed within the vertebral foramen of the vertebrae. In the intervertebral spaces, the canal is protected by the ligamentum flavum posteriorly and the posterior longitudinal ligament anteriorly. The outermost layer of the meninges, the dura mater, is closely associated with the arachnoid mater which in turn is loosely connected to the innermost layer, the pia mater. The meninges divide the spinal canal into the epidural space and the subarachnoid space. The pia mater is closely attached to the spinal cord. A subdural space is generally only present due to trauma and/or pathological situations. The subarachnoid space is filled with cerebrospinal fluid and contains the vessels that supply the spinal cord, namely the anterior spinal artery and the paired posterior spinal arteries, accompanied by corresponding spinal veins. The anterior and posterior spinal arteries form anastomoses known as the vasocorona of the spinal cord and these supply nutrients to the canal. The epidural space contains loose fatty tissue, and a network of large, thin-walled blood vessels called the internal vertebral venous plexuses. Spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the canal which can occur in any region of the spine and can be caused by a number of factors. The spinal canal was first described by Jean Fernel. ==References== ==External links== * Diagram at wisc.edu Category:Bones of the thorax Category:Bones of the vertebral column ","title":"Spinal cavity"},{"id":"824450","text":"Thomas Culpeper ( 1514 ‚Äì 10 December 1541) was a courtier and close friend of Henry VIII, and related to two of his queens, Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard. He is known to have had many private meetings with Catherine after her marriage, though these may have involved political intrigue rather than sex. A letter to him was found, written by Queen Catherine and signed, \\"Yours as long as life endures.\\" Accused of adultery with Henry's young consort, Culpeper denied it and blamed the queen for the situation, saying that he had tried to end his friendship with her, but that she was \\"dying of love for him\\". Eventually, Culpeper admitted to intending to sleep with the queen, though he never admitted to having actually done so. ==Early life== Thomas Culpeper was the second of the three sons of Alexander Culpeper (d. 1541) of Bedgebury, south of Maidstone in Kent, and his second wife, Constance Harper. His older brother, also named Thomas, was a client of Thomas Cromwell.Retha M. Warnicke, 'Katherine [Katherine Howard] (1518x24‚Äì1542)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004 The brothers were known for collecting valuable items for the royal family during their time at court.Wagner, John A. Bosworth Field to Bloody Mary: An Encyclopedia of the Early Tudors. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2003. He was distantly related to the Howard clan, who were immensely powerful at the time, being a distant cousinAccording to Culpepper Connections, The Culpepper Family History Site they were 7th cousins. of Joyce Culpeper, Catherine Howard's mother. They were particularly influential after the fall of Cardinal Wolsey in 1529, and for a brief time under the reign of Anne Boleyn, who was one of their cousins. ==Royal service== Having bought the Higham Park estate at Bridge near Canterbury in 1534, by 1535 Culpeper was acting as courtier for the Viscount Lisle and his wife, Honor, during which time he collected a number of items for them. In 1538, Honor presented Culpeper with a hawk and during that same year, Culpeper worked with Richard Cromwell to gain a hawk for King Henry VIII. Culpeper was described as \\"a beautiful youth\\" and he was a great favourite of Henry. It was because of this favouritism that Culpeper had major influence with the King and was often bribed to use his influence on others' behalf.Wagner In 1539, a Thomas Culpeper was accused of raping a park-keeper's wife and then murdering a villager. However, there is a possibility that the rapist was Culpeper's elder brother, also called Thomas. Due to similar names, some confusion between the brothers is possible. However, his elder brother, Thomas (born around 1501), may have received a knighthood, as referenced on the Culpeper Family Tree. Whoever was the guilty party, through influence on the King, a pardon was given. Culpeper was given the honour of being keeper of the armoury and Henry eventually made Culpeper gentleman to the King's Privy chamber, giving him intimate access to the King, as the role involved dressing and undressing Henry and often sleeping in his bedchamber. He was part of the group of privileged courtiers who greeted Henry's German bride Anne of Cleves when she arrived in England for her marriage. From 1537‚Äì1541, Culpeper was given several gifts, including keeper of the manor at Penshurst Palace and property in Kent, Essex, Gloucestershire, and Wiltshire. ==Affair with Catherine Howard== In 1540, Culpeper caught the attention of Henry's new teenaged bride, Catherine Howard, and by 1541 they were spending time together, often alone and late at night, aided and abetted by Catherine's Lady-in-waiting, Lady Rochford, the widowed sister-in-law of Anne Boleyn. The affair caused the downfall of all involved. Culpeper had close access to the Queen's apartments and often came into contact with the Queen and her attendants.Smith, Lacey Baldwin. A Tudor Tragedy. New York: Pantheon Books, 1961. Thomas Culpeper was first introduced into Catherine Howard's personal life in March 1541, when King Henry VIII went on a trip to Dover and left Catherine behind at Greenwich. At this time Culpeper began asking favours of Catherine. The private meetings between them are thought to have begun sometime around May of that same year. Catherine's lady-in-waiting the Lady Rochford, arranged the meetings between Culpeper and Catherine. On these occasions only she and another lady-in-waiting, Katherine Tilney, were allowed entrance to the Queen's chamber. On 30 June Catherine and King Henry VIII travelled north to York in the hope of meeting James V of Scotland. They arrived at Lincoln on 9 August, where Culpeper met Catherine for another secret meeting in her bedchamber. These meetings continued in Pontefract Castle, after the court arrived on 23 August. It is believed that the letter Catherine sent to Culpeper was sent during these proceedings. In this letter she wishes to know how he is and is troubled that he is ill. Catherine also writes: :\\"I never longed so muche for [a] thynge as I do to se you and to speke wyth you, the wyche I trust shal be shortely now,\\" and \\"my trust ys allway in you that you wolbe as you have promysed me...\\"Howard, Catherine. Letter to Thomas Culpeper. 1541. TS. The National Archives, U.K. These statements cause some audiences to believe that their affair was not only one of passion, but also centred on Culpeper's political agenda. With Henry in poor health and only his very young son Edward to succeed him, being Catherine's favourite would undoubtedly have put Culpeper in a very strong political position. As a well-liked member of the King's Privy Chamber he enjoyed a close relationship with Henry. If the promise Catherine mentioned was in reference to his possible knowledge about her previous sexual relationships, Culpeper could have used this as leverage to gain power and control over the Queen herself. In this specific letter Catherine states that she longs to talk with Culpeper but does not mention any desire to be intimate with him, although she does sign off with the dedication, ‚ÄúYours as long as life endures‚Äù. Letter from Catherine Howard to Thomas Culpeper Accounts of the Queen's premarital indiscretions had meanwhile come to the attention of Thomas Cranmer, then Archbishop of Canterbury. During Cranmer's investigations, he came across rumours of an affair between the Queen and Culpeper; Culpeper was soon arrested for questioning. Both he and the Queen denied the allegations, but the letter from Catherine to Culpeper, found during a search of Culpeper's quarters, provided the evidence for which Cranmer was looking. Whether the association between Culpeper and the Queen was ever consummated is still debated by historians, but the letter seems to give evidence of Catherine's feelings for Culpeper. Also in the letter was a reference to Jane Boleyn, Lady Rochford. ==Downfall and execution== Culpeper was arrested on orders from King Henry and, in December 1541, was tried for adultery alongside Francis Dereham, who was separately accused of adultery with the Queen before her marriage to Henry. Catherine had not hidden the affair with Culpeper from members of her household, who now testified against her to protect themselves. The Queen was portrayed as having seduced Culpeper at Chenies Palace in Buckinghamshire. With testimony given of private meetings at Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, and during the royal progress to the north of England in the summer of 1541, his fate was sealed. Under interrogation, Culpeper admitted to intending to have sexual relations with Catherine and that she intended to sleep with him. Lady Rochford, however, stated in her interrogation that she believed that Culpeper had \\"known the Queen carnally.\\" Both Culpeper and Dereham were found guilty and sentenced to death. They were both to be hanged, drawn and quartered. Both men pleaded for mercy; Culpeper, presumably because of his former closeness to the King, received a commuted sentence of simple beheading. Dereham received no such mercy. Culpeper was executed along with Dereham at Tyburn on 10 December 1541, and their heads were put on display on London Bridge. Culpeper was buried at St Sepulchre-without-Newgate church in London. Queen Catherine Howard and Lady Rochford were both subsequently executed on 13 February 1542, and were buried in the Church of St Peter ad Vincula, on the grounds of the Tower of London. ==Popular fiction== In popular fiction, very little is told about Thomas Culpeper, save his association with King Henry VIII's fifth wife. He is portrayed in several plays and several writings, always closely associated with Catherine. === Portrayal in literature === In the book A Tudor Tragedy; The Life and Times of Catherine Howard, by Lacey Baldwin Smith, the author writes that there were rumours during the time period that Thomas Culpeper and Catherine Howard intended to be married before Henry VIII set his sights on her.A Tudor Tragedy, The Life and Times of Catherine Howard, Lacey Baldwin Smith, 1961, The Reprint Society Ltd., page 61 The book describes Thomas Culpeper as a young man in his 20s, hence his appeal to Catherine, who, during the time of her marriage to Henry VIII, witnessed his steadily declining physical state and overall health. This was in conjunction with his steadily declining sanity; during his last year with Catherine Howard, Henry VIII was seen as more and more emotionally erratic. The affair seems to have always attracted the attention of authors who are looking to write about scandal. One such particular writer was a Spanish chronicler who may have been at King Henry VIII's court, who wrote his very romantic ‚Äì and for the greater part inaccurate ‚Äì interpretation of Catherine's career.A Tudor Tragedy, Lacey Baldwin Smith, 1961, The Reprint Society Ltd, page 150, 151 In his version of the story, he portrays King Henry VIII as the cruel, selfish husband, who bullied the unwilling Catherine into marrying him against her will, despite her previous involvement with Thomas Culpeper, who is portrayed as the devoted and heartbroken hero who resisted his love for Catherine for as long as he possibly could, until one day he secretly slipped her a note declaring his love for her. When their love was discovered by the King, Thomas was arrested but, according to the writings, he stated: ‚ÄúGentlemen, do not seek to know more than that the King deprived me of the thing I loved best in the world, and, though you may hang me for it, I can assure you that she loves me as well as I love her, although up to this hour no wrong has ever passed between us. Before the King married her, I thought to make her my wife, and when I saw her irremediably lost to me I was like to die.‚Äù According to the story, the Duke of Somerset retorted to this monologue with, \\"You have said quite enough, Culpeper, to lose your head.\\"A Tudor Tragedy, Lacey Baldwin Smith, 1961, The Reprint Society Ltd, page 151 In Ford Madox Ford's trilogy on Catherine Howard, entitled The Fifth Queen, Culpeper is portrayed as an intimate of Catherine's who, early on in the novel, arrives with her in tow on a mule as the wedding with Anne of Cleves is about to take place. In dragging the mule forward as a riot is starting outside the King's garden, he is described as \\"a man in green at the mule's head, [who] ... sprang like a wild cat under the beast's neck. His face blazed white, his teeth shone like a dog's, he screamed and struck his dagger through the butcher's throat [someone trying to block his and Catherine's way]. His motions were those of a wild beast\\". His introduction to Court is brought about through Catherine. He is sent to Calais to keep him from getting in trouble at Court for his brawling. He is often mentioned as having sold property to buy his impoverished cousin Catherine a proper dress and is not at all consistent with the historical record. === On-screen portrayals === In the 1933 film The Private Life of Henry VIII, Culpeper was played by Robert Donat. In the 1970 BBC series The Six Wives of Henry VIII, he was played by Ralph Bates, though Robin Sachs assumed the role in the subsequent 1972 film, Henry VIII and His Six Wives. In the Showtime television series The Tudors, Thomas Culpeper is portrayed by Torrance Coombs; in this series, he is characterized as a cruel, arrogant man whose interest in Catherine is purely sexual, his relationship with her is an outgrowth of a preexisting affair with Jane Boleyn, Viscountess Rochford (a detail that has no basis in history). === References in popular culture === In the musical Six, loosely based on the lives of the six wives of Henry VIII, Culpeper is mentioned in the fourth verse of Catherine Howard's song \\"All You Wanna Do\\", as the \\"friend [she] need[ed]\\" while she was married to Henry. ==References== ==External links== *Letter from Catherine Howard to Thomas Culpeper Category:1510s births Category:1541 deaths Category:1539 crimes Category:Executed people from Kent Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:16th-century English people Category:Recipients of English royal pardons Category:People executed under the Tudors for treason against England Category:People executed by Tudor England by decapitation Category:People executed under Henry VIII Category:People executed at Tyburn Category:Catherine Howard Category:Male lovers of royalty Thomas Category:English courtiers ","title":"Thomas Culpeper"},{"id":"824479","text":"Charles Bennett (28 December 1870 ‚Äì 18 December 1948) was a British athlete, winner of the 1500 metres at the 1900 Summer Olympics and the first British track and field athlete to become Olympic champion. He was a member of Finchley Harriers (founded 1877) which was amalgamated into Hillingdon Athletic Club in 1966. Bennett, a train driver born in Shapwick, Dorset, was one of the top British middle-distance runners in his years, winning the AAA championship in 1897, and the cross country running title in 1899 and 1900. In the latter year, also the Olympic year, he won the British title in the mile, qualifying himself for the 1500 m in Paris. That distance had a rather weak field, and Bennett lead throughout the race, defeating local favourite Henri Deloge in 4:06.0. That time was an official world record, although many athletes had already run faster in competitions over the slightly longer mile. Together with the combined British/Australian 5000 metres team, Bennett won a second Olympic title. Bennett finished first in the race, with an unofficial world record 15:29.2, beating teammate John Rimmer. His third event was the 4000 m steeplechase, in which he just failed to catch up with the same Rimmer in the final part of the race, settling for second place. Bennett died in Bournemouth, aged 79.

He was one of the few leaders of the romantic movement who cared more for treatment of form than of colour. ==Biography== Xavier Sigalon was born in Uz√®s, Gard, towards the end of 1787, son of a poor rural schoolmaster. With great difficulty he came to Paris and obtained admission to the studio of Pierre-Narcisse Gu√©rin. He did not agree with the instruction he was given, and tried to train himself by studying the Italian masters in the gallery of the Louvre. In 1822 he exhibited The Young Courtesan, which at once attracted attention and was bought for the Luxembourg. Sigalon continued to challenge himself, producing Locusta in 1824, and Athaliahs Massacre in 1827. Both these works showed incontestable power; but the Vision of St Jer√¥me, which appeared at the Salon of 1831, and the Crucifixion, were much the most individual of all his achievements. In 1831 he received the cross of the Legion of Honour. His paintings at this time, although powerful in their drawing and composition, were not colorful and did not sell. Sigalon found himself forced to earn a humble living by painting portraits. In 1833 Adolphe Thiers, then minister of the interior, recalled Sigalon to Paris and entrusted him with the task of copying the Sistine fresco of The Last Judgement for a hall in the Palace of the Fine Arts. His friend Fran√ßois Souchon agreed to assist Sigalon in this huge task. There was a dispute between the two artists, and Souchon returned to Paris. He was replaced as Sigalon's assistant by Numa Boucoiran. When Sigalon exhibited his gigantic work in the Baths of Diocletian at Rome, he was visited in state by Gregory XVI. Sigalon carried his copy back to Paris in February 1837. He returned to Rome some time later to copy the pendants of the Sistine Chapel, but succumbed to an attack of cholera on 18 August 1837. ==ReferencesSources=== * * * Category:1787 births Category:1837 deaths Category:People from Uz√®s Category:19th-century French painters Category:French male painters Category:French romantic painters ","title":"Xavier Sigalon"},{"id":"824514","text":"Henry Denis Litton CBE, GBM (Chinese transliteration: ÁÉàÈ°ØÂÄ´) (born 7 August 1934) is a retired judge in Hong Kong. ==Early life and education== Born into a Eurasian family in Hong Kong, Henry Litton excelled in school during his early years first at the Diocesan Boys' School in Hong Kong and then in England which he was educated at King's College, Taunton and Merton College, Oxford, where he graduated with honours in jurisprudence. His father, John Letablere Litton (1903-1941), served as a gunner in the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps. He was killed in action on 18 December 1941 defending Hong Kong from Japanese attack, and was laid to rest in Stanley Military Cemetery. His mother Enid Tak-ching Lo-Litton was a tennis player and won an impressive thirteen Hong Kong National Championships over a 24-year span.

Litton was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1970 and co-founded the Hong Kong Law Journal with Gerald de Basto QC, another local barrister. He also served as Chairman of the Bar Association from 1971 to 1973, from 1977 to 1980 and again from 1983 to 1985. Litton was appointed in 1987 an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for his contribution to the law and was elevated to the bench in 1992 as a Justice of Appeal. He rose steadily through the ranks, becoming Vice-President of the Court of Appeal in 1995 and a Permanent Judge of the Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong's court of last resort) in 1997, when British colonial rule in Hong Kong ended and China resumed its sovereignty over the region. He assumed senior status three years later, citing personal reasons. Until 2015, he continued to hear cases on a part-time basis as a non-permanent judge of the Court he served. In 2007, Litton was appointed a Judicial Commissioner, as well as a Justice of Appeal, of the Supreme Court of Brunei Darussalam. ==Extrajudicial life== In 2019, Litton released his book Is the Hong Kong Judiciary Sleepwalking to 2047?, in which he criticised numerous aspects of Hong Kong's legal system, focusing particularly on the misuse of judicial reviews in recent years. He also argued that courts ought not serve as a ‚Äúdebating chamber‚Äù to challenge government policy.

A member of the Democratic party, he served in the United States Congress from 1963 to 1965 and was the third lieutenant governor of Hawaii from 1966 to 1970. He unsuccessfully ran for governor twice, in 1970 and 1974. ==Early life== Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Gill attended public schools (Lincoln Elementary and Roosevelt High School).The Thomas P. Gill Papers, University of Hawaii Library He was a decorated infantryman in the Pacific Theatre during World War II, earning a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. After the war, he attended law school at Boalt Hall at UC-Berkeley and began practicing law in Hawaii.Tom Gill, 87, was wild card of politics ==Career== Gill served in Hawaii's territorial legislature and, after statehood in 1959, became a member of the first state house delegation, representing the 15th district until his time in Congress. He was elected to one of his state's two Congressional seats in 1962 and served one term. In Congress, he was a staunch supporter of liberal causes, including civil rights. He then worked as the director of Hawaii's Office of Economic Opportunity. In 1964, Gill chose not to seek reelection and instead ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senator, losing to Republican incumbent Hiram Fong. In 1966, he was elected Lieutenant Governor with incumbent Governor John A. Burns. During his term as Lieutenant Governor, Gill, considered outspoken and acerbic, developed differences with Burns, and was never shy about criticizing the incumbent, despite being part of his administration. In 1970, Gill challenged Burns in the Democratic primary. Gill ran as a reformer, campaigning against what he described as an entrenched, corrupt political machine. He narrowly lost, even though Burns significantly outspent him in a savvy campaign that included sophisticated use of expensive image-building television spots. Most in the state's large Japanese population remained loyal to Burns, who had spearheaded their rise to political power during the 1950s. Before Neil Abercrombie lost in 2014 this race stood as the closest anyone came to a primary defeat of an incumbent governor of Hawaii. Gill ran in the primary for governor again in 1974, but lost again in the primary to George Ariyoshi, who had succeeded him as lieutenant governor. After failing both campaigns, he resumed his career as a lawyer. ==Papers== Thomas P. Gill donated 86 record center boxes of material to the University of Hawaii at Manoa Library in May 2001. The bulk of the papers cover Gill's two years in Congress and four years in the Hawaii Lt. Governor's office. The collection is rich in material documenting his enthusiastic political life and his concerns about nuclear power; the environment; land development, especially on the Big Island of Hawaii; social and economic justice; and the high cost of living in Hawaii. There is a smaller amount of material from his pre- and post-Congressional life. The papers are arranged in five series: Political Offices (held by Gill), 1955‚Äì1970; Politics (Democratic Party, Hawaii and National), 1952‚Äì1972; Personal (election campaigns and biographical material), 1939‚Äì2001; Memorabilia (mostly election campaigns), 1940‚Äì2005 and bulk 1958-1980; Audiovisual (audiotapes, films, photographs; primarily election campaigns and Big Island development), 1958-1974. The papers were arranged and described from July 2005 through March 2006 by archivist Ellen Chapman, and are available to researchers in the Library's Archives & Manuscripts Department by appointment. A Finding Aid, which provides a timeline, series descriptions, and list of specific topics covered in the collection is available at The Thomas P.

After passing his bar exam in 1959, Ching commenced his practice of law in Hong Kong, and was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1974. During this period, he was regarded by some as the most successful barrister in Hong Kong's history. Ching was later appointed to the Court of Appeal in 1995 and the Court of Final Appeal in 1997, where he served with distinction. He resigned in 2000 due to health reasons and died soon after. A scholarship named after him was set up by the Hong Kong Bar Association. Throughout his career both as advocate and as judge Mr. Justice Ching was an advocate for the merging of the legal professions in Hong Kong (barristers and solicitors). ==References== Category:1935 births Category:2000 deaths Category:People educated at King's College, Taunton Category:Alumni of University College, Oxford Category:Hong Kong judges Category:Recipients of the Grand Bauhinia Medal Category:British Hong Kong judges Category:Reform Club of Hong Kong politicians Category:Hong Kong Senior Counsel Category:Barristers of Hong Kong ","title":"Charles Ching"},{"id":"824573","text":"Western Gunfighters is the name of two American Western-anthology comic book series published by Marvel Comics and its 1950s forerunner, Atlas Comics. That initial Atlas series ran eight issues, from 1956 to 1957, and featured artists including Gene Colan, Reed Crandall, Joe Maneely, John Severin, Alex Toth, Al Williamson, and Wally Wood, with many stories written by Stan Lee. Volume two, published by Marvel from 1970 to 1975, consisted mostly of Western reprints but also featured new material, including stories of the masked Old West hero Ghost Rider and the introductions of such short-lived Western features as \\"Gunhawk\\" and \\"Renegades\\", by writers including Gary Friedrich and Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel, and artists including Dick Ayers and Tom Sutton. ==Publication historyAtlas Comics=== Marvel Comics' first comic book titled Western Gunfighters was an anthology series published by the company's 1950s forerunner, Atlas Comics. It premiered with issue #20 (cover-dated June 1956), taking over the numbering of a previous Atlas series, Apache Kid, the star of which did not go on to appear in the revamped book. Atlas editor-in- chief Stan Lee wrote many of the stories, generally signing them. The artwork included at least two stories each by Dave Berg, Vic Carrabotta, Gene Colan, and Don Heck, and one story each from Reed Crandall, Russ Heath. Angelo Torres, Alex Toth, Al Williamson, Wally Wood, and George Woodbridge. Most covers were by John Severin or Joe Maneely. It ran through issue #27 (Aug. 1957). The series was one of several Atlas Western anthologies that included Frontier Western, Gunsmoke Western, Western Thrillers, and Wild Western; and two successor series that took over its numbering, Cowboy Action and Quick- Trigger Western. ===Marvel Comics=== Marvel's second series of that name was a Western anthology that ran 33 issues (Aug. 1970 - Nov. 1975) and used an almost identical cover logo. Primarily consisting of reprints of Atlas / Marvel Western stories, it also ran new material through issue #7 (Jan. 1972), with the feature \\"Ghost Rider\\", a continuation of Marvel's 1967 series, headlining. These first seven issues were 68- or 52-page, 25¬¢ \\"giants\\", relative to the typical 15¬¢ comics of the times, with #8-on published as standard 36-page comics at the prevailing price of 20¬¢, rising to 25¬¢ by the time it ended publication. The premiere issue featured a 10-page Ghost Rider story by the character's 1960s team of writer Gary Friedrich and penciler Dick Ayers, and introduced three new features: *\\"Gunhawk\\", created by writer Jerry Siegel, the co-creator of Superman, and penciler Werner Roth, starred an initially unnamed Old West bounty hunter. The 10-page story marked the first professional comic-book work of artist Sal Buscema, the inker. After Ghost Rider-Gunhawk team-up stories in issues #4-5, the \\"Gunhawk\\" feature ran in issues #5-7. After a 28-year hiatus, Gunhawk, his name now given as Lee Barnett, co-starred in the 2000 miniseries Blaze of Glory, where he is killed after murdering Kid Colt by shooting him in the back. Marvel predecessor Atlas Comics had published a short-lived Western title, The Gunhawk, from 1950-1951, starring an unrelated character named Red Larabee.Nevins, \\"Red Larabee\\". *\\"Tales of Fort Rango\\", by writer Friedrich and artist Syd Shores, starred a post-Civil War U.S. Army office, Major Brett Sabre, sent to instill order at an undisciplined fort in The Dakotas. The feature did not continue, though the locale of Fort Rango reappeared in the first six issues of Red Wolf, starring a Native American hero. Saber returned decades later in a single 10-page feature, \\"The Man from Fort Rango!\\", in the one-shot Western Legends #1 (Sept. 2006). *\\"Renegades\\", created by writers Roy Thomas and Mike Friedrich (no relation to Gary Friedrich) and artist Tom Sutton, concerned a quartet sent out by Colonel William Travis from the Alamo to seek reinforcements, and unjustly branded as cowards. The foursome's only subsequent appearances were in issues #4-5. *In addition, issue #4 included the one-off \\"The Outcast\\", about a \\"half-breed\\" Caucasian-Native American. According to a note at the story's end, the feature was \\"conceived by Roy Thomas and executed by [penciler Barry Windsor-]Smith and [writer Steve] Parkhouse nearly two years ago!\\" In issue #6, Marvel's original Western Ghost Rider, Carter Slade, was killed saving his brother Lincoln, a U.S. marshal. In the following issue, his place was taken by his young friend and sidekick, Jaime Jacobs, who was almost immediately killed in action. In that same story, Lincoln Slade became the third Ghost Rider. Reprinted backup features in the first seven issues variously starred the Apache Kid, the Western Kid, Wyatt Earp, and the Black Rider (renamed Black Mask). The series thereafter became all-reprint. Issues #8-9 featured Black Mask as the lead feature, plus the Apache Kid and the Outlaw Kid. Issues #10-15 swapped gunfighter Matt Slade for the Outlaw Kid. From #16 through the final issue, #33, the lineup was Kid Colt as the starring feature, plus the Apache Kid and the Western Kid, the latter dropping that handle and going by his regular name, Tex Dawson, in a feature called \\"Gun- Slinger\\". Herb Trimpe penciled most of the initial seven issues' covers, with Ayers supplying two and John Severin one. The bulk of the reprint issues' covers were by Gil Kane, with Severin drawing #8-10. The remainder were by a smattering of artists, including Jim Steranko (#14, March 1973). ==References* Atlas Tales Category:Atlas Comics titles Category:Comics by Len Wein Category:Marvel Comics titles Category:Western (genre) comics Category:1956 comics debuts Category:1957 comics endings Category:1970 comics debuts Category:1975 comics endings ","title":"Western Gunfighters"},{"id":"824609","text":"Galliano may refer to: *Galliano (liqueur), a liqueur *Galliano (surname) *Galliano (band), 1980s‚Äì1990s UK acid jazz/jazz funk/dance band *Galliano, a subdivision of Cant√π, Italy *Galliano, Louisiana, United States *Banco Galliano, also Galliano's Bank, a bank that operated in Gibraltar from 1855 to 1987 ==See also== *Galiano (disambiguation) *Gagliano (disambiguation) *Galeano (disambiguation) ","title":"Galliano"},{"id":"824672","text":"Joseph \\"Joe\\" James Fern (August 25, 1872 - February 20, 1920) was the first Mayor of Honolulu from 1909 to 1915 and again from 1917 to 1920. During and after his tenure, Fern became one of the most beloved political figures in the Territory of Hawaii. He was one of the first members of the Hawai'i Democratic Party. ==Early years== Fern was born on the Big Island of Hawaii to James Fern and Kaipua Kaipo Luahoomae on August 25, 1872. In 1885, Fern worked in the town of Kohala at the Union Mill Plantation. In 1892, he moved to the island of Oahu to work at the Hawaiian Tramways Company, driving trolleys and streetcars through downtown Honolulu. In 1894, Fern traded jobs to work as a ship's master at the Wilder Steamship Company. ==Political career== At the time the Democratic Party had been deadlocked with infighting although Fern could not be free from the feuds he preferred to avoid them. In 1907, Fern was influenced to run for a seat on the Honolulu Board of Supervisors. He won the election and served for two years before the creation of the office of Mayor of Honolulu. The office of mayor was created upon the insistence of Washington, D.C., despite the opposition of the Big Five oligarchy that dominated the economy of Hawaii. Fern was multilingual, speaking Hawaiian, English, Japanese, Chinese, and Portuguese and used it to his advantage throughout his political career. Another advantage he had was with his avoidance of the Democratic infighting he made few enemies which resulted in relatively united support by Democrats for Fern. On January 4, 1909, Fern won the special election for the newly created mayor's office by a margin of 7 votes and re-elected in the regular elections in 1910 with a margin of less than 100 votes. In 1915, he lost a reelection bid against Hawaii Republican Party member John Lane. After leaving office Fern was appointed City Jailer by Sheriff Charles Rose. When Lane tried to run for reelection, Fern challenged his successor again and won by 300 votes. ==Family life== He married Julia Natua in 1889 and had two children: Julia, James. In 1894, he married Sheba Kaiheku'i Alapai (died 1910) with whom he had twelve children: Joseph James, Mary K., Nancy K., George, Kaipo, Elizabeth, Marion, Mary, Keo, Santa Clara, Henry C., Esta. In 1910, he married Emma Keliikekukahilikaleleokalahikiolaokalani Smith. They had one child, Victoria Kukahilihiapoaliilani. ==Death and legacy== Fern died from complications with diabetes, while still in office. At the beginning of 1920 Fern came down with a high fever and he took several sick leaves. On February 9 he was admitted to Queen's Medical Center, Fern died there February 20, 1920. Evidence of his popularity among the people he served, Fern was granted a state funeral and was laid in the throne room of  ªIolani Palace. During the burial rites at the King Street Catholic Cemetery, the United States Army Air Corps presented a fly-over ceremony in a v-formation. Fern Elementary school in the Kalihi neighborhood in Honolulu was named after him. == References == ==External links== * Joseph J.

The game system is designed to allow players to create virtually any type of hero or villain desired. ==History== In the late 1990s, Steve Kenson had an idea for a superhero setting that he had been contracted to produce. Through a series of misfortunes, the project fell through and he was left with a partially completed manuscript. Shopping it around to various publishers, none were interested (superhero game popularity had declined at that time) until he talked to Chris Pramas (President of Green Ronin Publishing) about the setting. Pramas made the offer to publish the setting if Kenson would also create a superhero game system based on the d20 System. Kenson agreed and began work. Over time, it became clear to him that the game would need to be released only under the Open Game License. Releasing the game under the d20 Standard Trademark License, as originally planned, would have prohibited the inclusion of ability generation and character advancement rules. Presenting a complete game was seen as taking precedence over having a d20 logo on the product, so the decision was made to use the OGL without the d20 license. Mutants & Masterminds was published in 2002; the setting, which was once known as Century City, became Freedom City was published in 2003. The first edition of M&M; books featured graphic design and art direction by the design studio Super Unicorn, but other firms provide the artwork on all subsequent releases. A second edition of the Mutants & Masterminds system debuted at Gen Con in 2005 and saw wide release in October of that year. A third edition of Mutants & Masterminds was released in 2011 and it has also been translated to Italian by Kaizoku Press. In the previous year Green Ronin Publishing had released another superhero role-playing game, DC Adventures. Both games have the same mechanical system and are fully compatible. ==System== Mutants & Masterminds' game mechanics use a highly modified version of the d20 System. Differences include changes to character creation, injury and damage, hit points, the addition of \\"hero points\\" and super powers, the elimination of character classes and attacks of opportunity, a modified skill list, a very different feat selection, and that any equipment possessed is considered a part of the character and purchased in a manner similar to powers. ===Power Level=== M&M; characters are not class-based nor do they technically have class levels. Instead, they have a Power Level (or \\"PL\\"), and typically a character begins at Power Level 10 instead of Level 1. This allows a character to begin as an already established superhero with incredible abilities. The power level represents the maximum rank of any combat abilities a character can purchase. Each power level typically grants a character an allotment of points to purchase attribute levels, base attack and defense bonuses, saving throws, feats, skill ranks and super powers, though the game encourages game masters to modify the number of points given per level up or down to reflect the style of game they wish to run. All aspects of the character, including abilities, feats, skills, powers, and equipment, are purchased from this pool of points. The M&M; power level restricts the maximum bonus held by skill ranks, ability scores, and most feats and powers. Beyond limiting bonuses, power level does nothing to restrict a character's power; a power level 10 character can have a maximum strength of 40. ===Toughness saves=== Damage in M&M; is handled differently as well. M&M; does not use hit points. Instead, characters have a fourth saving throw called the \\"toughness save\\" which is based on their Constitution scores, like the fortitude save. Weapons and powers that do lethal and subdual damage do not roll any dice to determine damage. Instead, damaging attacks are ranked based upon their overall power. For example, a fairly fit but normal human may throw a punch that inflicts +1N (non-lethal) damage, while the irradiated simian mastermind with enhanced strength and razor-sharp claws throws out +12L (lethal) damage. When a character is struck by an attack, he or she rolls a toughness save against a target number equal to the rank of the attack plus 15. Success allows the character to shrug off the attack with minimal effect, while failure results in injury according to the degree of failure and the type of damage. Accumulated damage applies a penalty to further saves, increasing the chances of any given attack knocking out the character. This system of damage is meant to model the nature of superhero comics, in which many characters can ignore most damage outright while still being susceptible to a lucky punch or superpowered blast. The Mastermind's Manual rulebook includes notes for conversion to traditional hit points if desired. ===Advancement=== In M&M;, characters are awarded experience points, called \\"power points\\" (pp), that can do many beneficial things for the character. As described above, power points are used to purchase powers, feats, skills, abilities, and devices. The specific nature of power points was changed drastically with the 2nd edition of Mutants & Masterminds. In the first edition, when a character accrues 15 pp, they advance a power level, thus raising the caps on power and skill ranks, as well as on power bonus stacking. Under the second edition, power points and power levels are independent, the latter being set by the gamemaster as a function of the campaign. The 2nd edition version of power level determines only the maximum bonus that any power can give, and does not imply that a character does or does not have the points required to purchase enough levels in any power to reach this limit. Though the two are described as being entirely independent, the Mutants & Masterminds manual recommends that the power level be increased by one with each 15 Power Points awarded. ===Hero points=== Like many other super-hero role-playing games, M&M; uses \\"hero points\\". Hero points allow an unlucky player to be able to hold their own in a battle, thus reducing the amount that luck plays into the gameplay. A hero point can do several things, like allow the reroll of a failed roll of any sort at a crucial moment, including toughness saves to avoid damage. On this reroll numbers under 11 have ten added to them, resulting in a range of 11-20, and a very slim chance of failing. A player may also use a hero point to ignore fatigue, allowing them to use temporary feats without the negative effects of fatigue that normally occur with such feat usage. Hero points are generally awarded to a player by the gamemaster when something bad befalls the character, such as the villain escaping without them having a chance of stopping him. This is particularly encouraged if the bad thing in question is something related to one of their disadvantages, and many disadvantages provide no other benefit aside from acting as a source of hero points. ==Settings== Neither edition of the core M&M; book comes with a default setting, but both include an adventure that takes place in the Freedom City setting. Settings published for the game include: *Autumn Arbor: This setting, from Arbor Productions (purchased by Daring Entertainment in 2009 and re- released under the title \\"Dawn of Legends\\" with several new rules and character options), details a world where super-beings (called \\"Neos\\") have existed publicly since World War II. Autumn Arbor takes place in a world where the laws and legal systems have evolved to handle the often ignored nuances of the comic book genre, and where the characters are depicted as real people beneath the costumes and powers, often with real-life issues such as parenting and addiction. The setting is also supported by a novel line; the first of which, Little Girl Lost, was written by Lee F. Szczepanik, Jr., Autumn Arbor co-creator. The Autumn Arbor Campaign Setting was a 2008 Origins Awards semi- finalist. The campaign world was further detailed in the Dawn of Legends sourcebook, which expanded the setting beyond the city of Autumn Arbor to include superhuman activities in nations such as China, Cuba, Germany, Japan, Mexico and others,including alterations in world history/world events outside the United States. The role of the federal government and the legal system in dealing with \\"Neos\\" is also given in greater depth. *Bedlam: Designed by James Thomson for Plain Brown Wrapper Games, the setting harkens back to the Iron Age of Comics, with more mature-themed characters, situations, and scenarios. It is set in Bedlam, the City of Nowhere (AKA the City of Rust). Bedlam is a deeply troubled metropolis, riven by economic hardship, corruption, and dark occult activities. While much of the setting details street-level heroes and villains, more powerful \\"four-color\\" characters also exist within the city. Player character heroes may choose to play to type as ruthless vigilantes or defy the genre by becoming role-models for Bedlam's downtrodden populace. *DC Adventures: Published as a spin-off title based on the mainstream comic-book universe published by DC Comics, its Hero's Handbook introduced the third edition Mutants & Masterminds rules. Additional books provided in game descriptions of the various heroes and villains populating the DC Universe (DC Adventures Heroes & Villains, Volumes 1 and 2) as well as detailing the DC Universe itself (DC Adventures Universe). *Freedom City: A four-color, city- based setting by Steve Kenson that is filled with elements that are similar to the great icons and concepts of classic comic books. *Gestalt: Published by BlackWyrm Games, this hefty third party setting presents a campaign world where superhumans (\\"gestalts\\") first appeared in 1989 with powers matching classical archetypes. A traditional superhero world colored by surreal elements. *Halt Evil Doer: A Marvel-esque setting by Phipps Gaming Studios that is similar to the Modern Age of comics. Despite having many iconic elements that spring from the Silver Age/Bronze Age of the classic Marvel Universe, the setting includes archetypes drawn from the DC comics as well, including a \\"trinity\\" of major heroes based loosely on Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. However, despite drawing from earlier decades of superhero history, the characters and setting reflect the more mature, diverse, and nuanced comics of the current era. Halt Evil Doer has been extensively supported and expanded on Green Ronin's Atomic Think Tank forums. *META-4: This setting, by Erik Mona, Kyle Hunter, and Sean Glenn, is detailed in the Crooks! sourcebook. It has been compared to edgier 1990s comic books. *The Infinite Universe: Presented in a three volume (with other volumes tentatively announced) series from Big Finger Games, the heroes, villains, and timeline of the Infinite Universe are covered in the books \\"Adepts of the Arcane\\", \\"Lords of Lightning\\", and \\"Sons of the Gun\\". The campaign includes many black ops oriented characters, magically oriented heroes and villains, and secret organizations. *Nocturnals: Based on Dan Brereton's Nocturnals comic book series, the setting book was written by Mr. Brereton, with the assistance of Chris Pramas. It is a horror/pulp-based setting. *Noir: Written by Christopher McGlothlin, Noir is based on classic film noir. The setting of Noir is a dark world where heroes are flawed and the friend you trust may be your greatest enemy. *Golden Age: A setting for adventures in the Golden Age of Comic Books published from 1938-55. It also details the Freedom City setting during that era. *Hero High:A supplemental rulebook dealing with teenage heroes. *Iron Age: Very similar to Golden Age except that it deals with the Modern Age of Comic Books which is considered to roughly encompass the mid-1980s through early 1990s. *Lockdown: A prison-based setting. *Paragons: A generic and modular \\"real-world\\" setting that takes the recent trends in comic book movies, the Ultimate Marvel line of comic books, and the television show Heroes as inspiration. *Wild Cards: An adaption of the novels of the same name, edited by George RR Martin. The setting itself is a much stranger version of superheroes, opting for z-list types with only one power or mutation. ===Superlink program=== Green Ronin licences the use of M&M; through the M&M; Superlink program. Under this program, other publishers may request permission from Green Ronin to publish their own material (such as adventure modules, character books, and new power books) incorporating \\"product identity\\" text from Green Ronin's published works. (Text which is not \\"product identity\\" is already covered by the Open Game License; its use requires no further permission from Green Ronin.) Over a dozen publishers have produced more than fifty products using the Superlink program. A few have released their products as hard-back or soft-back books through retail outlets, but most have produced products as Portable Document Format books intended to be obtained on-line through electronic distribution systems. ==ReferencesMutants and Masterminds at RPGnetWiki * www.d20herosrd.com A fan-built and maintained SRD (System Reference Document) that includes all of the Open Game Content portions of the Mutants and Masterminds 3E rules.

Smith grew up in London and became interested in rock music at 15. He soon formed a friendship with future Iron Maiden guitarist Dave Murray, who inspired him to take up the guitar. After leaving school at 16, he formed a band called Urchin, which he led until their demise in 1980. He joined Iron Maiden in November 1980, replacing Dennis Stratton. Following a short-lived solo project called ASAP, he left Iron Maiden in 1990 and, after a year-long hiatus, formed the bands The Untouchables and, subsequently, Psycho Motel. In 1997, Psycho Motel was put on hold when Smith joined the band of former Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson. Smith and Dickinson would go on to return to Iron Maiden in 1999, after which the band gained new success. Smith has a current side project called Primal Rock Rebellion. ==BiographyEarly years and Urchin: 1977‚Äì1980=== Born in Hackney, Smith grew up in Clapton. He purchased his first record, Deep Purple's Machine Head, at the age of 15. This led him to befriend Dave Murray, with whom he formed a band called Stone Free, which comprised Murray on guitar, Smith on vocals and their friend, Dave McCloughlin, playing the bongos. After seeing the attention Murray received from girls, Smith took up the guitar, starting with an old Spanish guitar once owned by his brother, before purchasing an old guitar of Murray's for ¬£5. His early influences included Johnny Winter and Pat Travers, which he claims made him a \\"melodic player\\" rather than a \\"speed merchant or a shredder\\" as he \\"was inspired by blues rock rather than metal.\\" Leaving school after completing his O-levels, Smith formed a band called Evil Ways, including Dave Murray on guitar, which was later renamed Urchin. Smith began writing his own material, including \\"22 Acacia Avenue\\", which was later included on Iron Maiden's The Number of the Beast (1982). At this point, Murray left the band to join Iron Maiden and Urchin signed with DJM Records and released a single, \\"Black Leather Fantasy\\", in 1977. Shortly afterwards, Murray joined Urchin on their next single, \\"She's a Roller\\", as he had been sacked from Iron Maiden after a row with then vocalist Dennis Wilcock, although he was reinstated six months later. Smith was also offered a place in Iron Maiden while they were in the process of signing with EMI in 1979, but turned them down to continue with his own band, a decision he later regretted as Urchin split up in 1980. ===First tenure in Iron Maiden: 1980‚Äì1990=== Without a band, Smith was left \\"wondering what to do next,\\" before he \\"literally bumped into Steve [Harris] and Dave,\\" who asked if he might want to reconsider joining. After a successful audition, Smith debuted with the band on a German TV show, before setting out on a UK tour and recording the Killers album, released in 1981. Smith's first song-writing contributions appeared on The Number of the Beast, co-penning \\"Gangland\\" and \\"The Prisoner\\", as well as the previously mentioned \\"22 Acacia Avenue\\", after which he began co-writing many songs with singer Bruce Dickinson, on the following Piece of Mind album. Smith and Dave Murray combined playing dual lead guitars, creating what AllMusic calls \\"the most formidable twin-guitar attack in heavy metal, outside of Glenn Tipton and K. K. Downing.\\" Smith, along with Steve Harris, also provides the band's backing vocals, although he sang lead on \\"Reach Out\\", the B-Side to the \\"Wasted Years\\" single, featuring Bruce Dickinson on backing vocals. Originally written by guitarist Dave \\"Bucket\\" Colwell, whom he had worked with on The Entire Population of Hackney project, Smith would later sing \\"Reach Out\\" again for Colwell's solo album, Guitars, Beers & Tears, released in 2010. ===Departure from Iron Maiden and other projects: 1989‚Äì1999=== While Iron Maiden were taking some time off in 1989, Smith released a solo LP with the band ASAP (Adrian Smith And Project), entitled Silver and Gold, which was a commercial failure in spite of a promotional club tour. Unhappy with the direction the band were taking for their next release, No Prayer for the Dying, and feeling that he could not help enough in the creative work, Smith agreed to leave Iron Maiden in 1990 during the album's pre-production stages, and was replaced by Janick Gers. After releasing the experimental Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son albums in 1986 and 1988 respectively, Steve Harris had decided that the band should go for a \\"stripped-down,\\" \\"street level\\" approach, which Smith thought was a \\"step backward.\\" No Prayer for the Dying contained one last Smith song, co-penned with Bruce Dickinson, entitled \\"Hooks in You\\". After leaving, Smith started a family with his Canadian wife, Nathalie, and would not play guitar again until he joined Iron Maiden onstage at Donington Park in 1992 to perform \\"Running Free\\". In the same year, after hearing King's X for the first time, he decided that he would \\"love to play in a band like that\\" and formed The Untouchables, which later became Psycho Motel. The band recorded two albums, State of Mind in 1996 and Welcome to the World in 1997, during which they supported Iron Maiden on the British leg of The X Factour. The project was put on hold, however, when Smith joined Bruce Dickinson for his 1997 album, Accident of Birth, after which he became a full-time member of Dickinson's solo outfit, embarking on two world tours and contributing to one further studio release, 1998's The Chemical Wedding. ===Return to Iron Maiden: 1999‚Äìpresent=== Smith performing with Iron Maiden during the Somewhere Back in Time World Tour. In 1999, Smith re-joined Iron Maiden, along with vocalist Bruce Dickinson, who commented, \\"When he left the band in 1990, I think everybody was a bit surprised at how much we missed him and certainly, I don't think anybody had realized how much the fans would miss him ‚Äì big time. I wouldn't have rejoined Iron Maiden if he wasn't in the band. I just don't think it would have been complete without Adrian, and now, it's great having three guitarists.\\" The band embarked on a short tour, after which the new line-up's first album, Brave New World, was recorded with producer Kevin Shirley and released in 2000. He remains in Iron Maiden, with whom he has released four further studio albums, 2003's Dance of Death, 2006's A Matter of Life and Death, 2010's The Final Frontier and 2015's The Book of Souls. Smith claims that his guitar playing improved after leaving the band in 1990, in particular while working with Roy Z, from whom he \\"learned a lot about picking\\" and became \\"more disciplined.\\" Since returning to Iron Maiden, he has also continued experimenting with tuning (which he began doing in Psycho Motel), stating that he has used drop D tuning in live renditions of \\"Run to the Hills\\", \\"Wrathchild\\", \\"The Trooper\\" and \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\". Although Smith had previously been known to contribute shorter, more \\"commercial\\" tracks, since his return to the band he has penned many longer songs, beginning with \\"Paschendale\\" from Dance of Death. Smith performs lead guitar, bass and backing vocals on the album Awoken Broken by his collaborative studio project with Mikee Goodman of SikTh called Primal Rock Rebellion. The title was released on 27 February 2012, while one song, \\"I See Lights\\", was released as a free download on the project's official website on 2 January. ==Personal life== Adrian Smith was born in Hackney Hospital and grew up a few streets away from his childhood friend, and current bandmate, Dave Murray. Smith, whose father was a painter and decorator from Homerton, was the youngest of three, with an older brother, Patrick, and a sister, Kathleen. As a child, he was \\"a Manchester United fanatic,\\" although he would lose his interest in football once he got into music. In his spare time, Smith is a keen angler, revealing that he used to take \\"worms and maggots\\" with him on tour, and was featured on the front cover of Angler's Mail on 25 August 2009. For over 20 years, he has been married to his Canadian wife, Nathalie Dufresne-Smith, who currently works for Maiden Flight, a cancer awareness/patient rights organisation, and the pair have three children, Dylan, Natasha, and Brittany, the last of whom works as a professional film production assistant. In April 2020, ironmaiden.com announced Smith's autobiography titled Monsters of River and Rock would be released in September 2020. The book primarily details Smith's love of fishing, and relates anecdotes from his many decades of pursuing the hobby whilst touring and recording with Iron Maiden. Smith stated that around 70% of his book was focused upon fishing, with the remaining content discussing his music career. In its review of the publication, MetalTalk described the book as 'a prize catch amongst rock biographies ‚Äì highly recommended.' ==EquipmentGuitars=== Jackson guitar. Smith currently prefers to use his Jackson signature 'San Dimas' Dinky, although he has used a variety of guitars over his career, including several different Dean models, various Jacksons, including the Randy Rhoads model, Fender Stratocasters (including three Fender Floyd Rose Classic Stratocasters; one with an added Roland midi pick-up), Gibson Les Pauls, Gibson Explorers, Gibson SGs, an Ibanez Destroyer, a Hamer Scarab, and Lado Guitars. On the A Matter of Life and Death DVD, he says the first decent guitar he bought was a Deluxe Gold Top 1972 Gibson Les Paul, which he paid ¬£235 for when he was 17, in 1974. He still uses it to this day, stating that \\"it's still probably the best guitar I've got\\". As of 2010, his touring guitars included: Gibson Les Paul Deluxe Goldtop 1972 with DiMarzio Super Distortion in bridge position, his Jackson Superstrat 1986 prototype (which can be seen in the Maiden England video) with the pickguard changed to resemble his signature model, a Jackson Signature model with black scratchplate and maple neck, an early 70s Gibson SG, and another Jackson, inspired by his Les Paul Goldtop. As of August 2007, Smith endorses Jackson Guitars, his first guitar company endorsement in over fifteen years. With Jackson he has released two signature models, a San Dimas Dinky and an SDX. Prior to his endorsement, he was seen using other Jackson guitars, such as a King V during his time in Bruce Dickinson's solo band, before he went to Fender guitars. In August 2008, he had a Jackson guitar stolen from backstage at a show in Greece. ===Effects, controllers and processors=== * Dunlop Uni-vibe Wah Controller * Dunlop Cry Baby Wah * Yamaha MFC10 Midi Foot Controller * DigiTech Whammy Pedal * DigiTech Eric Clapton Crossroads * Two Ibanez TS-808 Tube Screamers * Duesenberg Channel 2 overdrive/distortion * Mike Hill B.I.S.

It is the headquarters of the Meru County, and the sixth largest urban centre in the country. Meru forms a municipal council with a population of 240,900 residents.Kenya National Bureau of Statistics: Population of local authorities ==Overview== Landscape in Meru County The city is located at 0.047035 degrees north and 37.649803 degrees east, on the northeast slopes of Mount Kenya. The Kathita River passes adjacent to the town. The main administrative part of the town is on the north side of the Kathita River. While the south side of the river is where residential areas are situated. Meru Town is situated about 8 km north of the equator, at an altitude of approximately 1500 m, in an area of mixed forest and clearings, small towns, villages and rural farms. The town is predominantly populated by the Ameru people, a Bantu ethnic group. In addition there are other people having different and diverse religions, cultures and all walks of life who live, trade and work in this agricultural and commercial town. ==History== Meru City's first District Commissioner was Edward Butler Horne. The Meru nicknamed him Kangangi, meaning the little wanderer due to his short stature and the fact that he traveled around Meru a lot as he surveyed the District. This was at a time when the Meru community lived a fairly settled life in ridge-top communities. The City's foundation in its present location was as a result of the military limitations of E. B. Horne's original camp at Mwitari's (homestead).F C. Gamble, assistant district commissioner, Meru, 1915. Private letter, 10 October 1919, \\"Lambert Papers\\" In 1912, according to Madeleine Laverne Platts, wife of W. A. F. Platts, Meru's first Assistant District Commissioner: > \\"Short [E. B.] Horne had laid out a nice little golf course. 500 local girls > were paid to cut the grass by plucking it out with their fingers. Next to > the golf course stood a large, handsome log house, in which the door opened > to reveal mud floors on which a large hat-stand stood gaunt and proud within > a pool of water.\\"1\\\\. Madeleine Laverne Platts, wife of W. A. E Platts, first > assistant district commissioner, Meru, 1912-1913. Diary, Rhodes House (see > \\"Archival Collections\\" in the Bibliography). As E.B. Horne was settling in Meru, Methodist leaders were seeking expansion. John B. Griffiths, a Welshman minister previously working at the Kenya coast, petitioned the colonial government to grant the entire Embu region to the Methodists as an exclusive religious sphere. The request was denied because the government considered it unsafe. Griffiths then applied a second time, requesting that the comparatively \\"peaceful\\" Meru district be regarded as the exclusive sphere of the United Methodist church. In December 1909 the government agreed.Hopkins, Trail Blazers and Road Makers, pp. 89, 97‚Äì99. Griffiths's party arrived at \\"Fort Meru\\" in October 1909, to be met by E. B. Horne who allotted the Methodists a plot of land at Ka-Aga. This was then a spirit forest, known to the Meru as the ‚Äúplace of curse removers [Aga]‚Äù, less than two miles north east of his new administrative headquarters. Griffiths's subsequent report of his expedition described Meru as a land of \\"hills, valleys, and innumerable streams.\\" He found it > \\"unlike any other area in Africa: Its hills are covered with ferns, hedges > are thick with blackberry bushes, and in the streams watercress abounds . . > . [and] mosquitoes are unknown. . . . We have been toiling for fifty years > in the sweltering climate of the coast, contending with tremendous > difficulties, bitter disappointments and deaths. We have been for years > meditating upon seeking another and better country in which our men can live > and labor and reap. SIR, HERE IT IS. THE FUTURE OF OUR EAST AFRICAN MISSION > LIES HERE. I implore the committee to enter it‚Äù. In January 1912 he and Griffiths and a Reverend Frank Mimmack occupied the allotted site and begun construction of the first buildings. They were later joined by Rev. Reginald T. Worthington. This site in Kaaga has grown to be Meru's Education Centre, with a National School, A leading school for students with special needs, two provincial schools and two Primary schools. In 1956, The Methodist Mission approached the Meru County Council and requested to be allotted land. Their request was granted and they were allotted 50 acres of land where they established the Methodist Training Institute in 1958. This institute grew over the years and merged with two other colleges to become The Kenya Methodist University, Kenya's largest private University. ==Climate== Meru has a cool subtropical highland climate (Csb) with heavy rainfall from March to May and from October to December. It has little rainfall in January and February and from June to September. ==Transport== The City of Meru is linked to Nairobi by a tarmac road named B6, from the south around the east side of Mount Kenya, via Embu, or from the northwest around the west and north side of Mount Kenya, via Nanyuki and Timau. An international airport is situated at Isiolo, 35 Kilometres away, via a new tarmac road through Ruiri. Within the town, the roads have seen a lot of improvement after the maintenance of urban roads was transferred to the Kenya Urban Roads Authority, which in turn set up its Upper Eastern Regional Headquarters in Meru. ==Tourism and hospitality== Meru City is a jumping-off place for Samburu and Buffalo Springs National Reserves and Lewa Conservancy, all some distance north of Meru, with Samburu and Buffalo Springs via Isiolo, and Meru National Park, to the northeast of Meru, via Maua in the Nyambene Hills. The Meru Museum is housed in Meru's first District Commissioner's Office, built by E. B. Horne. It preserves the historical and cultural artifacts of the Meru people.Meru Museum It is at Rutundu log cabins 20 Kilometre west of Meru City that Prince William proposed to the Duchess of Cambridge.

An inverted microscope is a microscope with its light source and condenser on the top, above the stage pointing down, while the objectives and turret are below the stage pointing up. It was invented in 1850 by J. Lawrence Smith, a faculty member of Tulane University (then named the Medical College of Louisiana). ==Construction== The stage of an inverted microscope is usually fixed, and focus is adjusted by moving the objective lens along a vertical axis to bring it closer to or further from the specimen. The focus mechanism typically has a dual concentric knob for coarse and fine adjustment. Depending on the size of the microscope, four to six objective lenses of different magnifications may be fitted to a rotating turret known as a nosepiece. These microscopes may also be fitted with accessories for fitting still and video cameras, fluorescence illumination, confocal scanning and many other applications. ==Biological applications== Inverted microscopes are useful for observing living cells or organisms at the bottom of a large container (e.g., a tissue culture flask) under more natural conditions than on a glass slide, as is the case with a conventional microscope. An inverted microscope is also used for visualisation of the mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria in the technique called Microscopic Observation Drug Susceptibility assay (MODS). ==Micromanipulation== Inverted microscopes are used in micromanipulation applications where space above the specimen is required for manipulator mechanisms and the microtools they hold, and in metallurgical applications where polished samples can be placed on top of the stage and viewed from underneath using reflecting objectives. ==References== ==External links== * An example of the Nachet-Smith inverted chemical microscope, c. 1885 Category:American inventions Category:Microscopes ","title":"Inverted microscope"},{"id":"824781","text":"John Henry Wilson (December 15, 1871 ‚Äì July 3, 1956), was a civil engineer, insurgent, co-founder of the Democratic Party of Hawaii, and Mayor of Honolulu, Hawaii three times: from 1920 to 1927, from 1929 to 1931, and from 1946 to 1954. == Early years == Wilson was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1871. His father was Charles B. Wilson (1850‚Äì1926), whose ethnic background was Scottish and Tahitian. C.B. Wilson was superintendent of the water works and fire chief under King KalƒÅkaua, and was Marshal of the Kingdom under Queen Lili ªuokalani. His mother was three quarters of European descent and one quarter Hawaiian Eveline M. \\"Kitty or Kittie\\" Townsend, granddaughter of Captain Henry Blanchard of the ship Thaddeus which had brought the first missionaries of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions to Hawaii in 1820. Wilson attended the Fort Street School and St. Alban's College. After graduating, he worked odd jobs on the West Coast, Hawaii, and Alaska. A construction job that he took in 1890 with Oahu Railway & Land led him to pursue civil engineering as a career. With financial support from the Queen, he enrolled at Stanford University in 1891. However, lack of funds after the overthrow of the monarchy in 1893 forced him to leave Stanford in 1894. While on the mainland he was approached by revolutionaries looking for suppliers for the 1895 Counter-Revolution in Hawaii, and attempt to restore the monarchy. He took part in the smuggling of guns and ammunition to Maui as part of the arms buildup by rebel forces. After the failed revolution he spoke little about his role in fearing he would be arrested for treason. He admitted he smuggled guns and was of rank to participate in planning his mission. He planned to land a ship of insurgents from Maui to attack Honolulu, but was the mission was aborted after the revolution was exposed and martial law was activated. In 1896 he once again joined Oahu Railway & Land and worked on a survey for a carriage road over the Nu ªuanu Pali. Armed with this knowledge, he and fellow Stanford student Louis Whitehouse bid for and won the contract to build the road, completing the road in January 1898. == Political career == Wilson served as roads engineer for both Maui and Honolulu counties. He was in a meeting on April 30, 1900 that organized the Democratic Party of Hawaii. He married hula practitioner Kini Kapahu on May 8, 1909. They moved to Moloka ªi and lived in the Pelekunu Valley before returning to Honolulu in 1919. His first political campaign was for a seat in the Territorial Senate in 1918, which he lost. However, upon the death of Mayor Joseph J. Fern in 1920, Wilson was selected by the Board of Supervisors to succeed him. Wilson served three times as mayor, from 1920 to 1927, 1929 to 1931, and from 1946 to 1954, a total of 19 years. As mayor, Wilson oversaw the completion of Honolulu Hale, which was completed in 1929 and consolidated the functions of the city's government. He also served on some territorial commissions, including coordinating the state holiday, Kamehameha Day, until 1956. Following World War II Wilson considered retirement he had been de facto leader of the Democratic Party of the original five founders only two remained. David KawƒÅnanakoa died in 1908, John S. McGrew died in 1911, and Charles J. McCarthy died in 1929. Delbert E. Metzger was a Federal Judge and powerful Democrat but his judicial career reduced his participation in politics this left Wilson as leader. Wilson preferred to leave the party in good hands. An ambitious detective named John A. Burns emerged as a successor Wilson could pass the torch to. In his 80s, Wilson was once again a revolutionary as a key member of a nonviolent revolution called the Democratic Revolution of 1954 that brought his party to power. The early Democrats held a dislike toward Asian-Americans as threats to Hawaiians and the social demographics of Hawaii. But unlike his colleagues, Wilson himself an early Democrat and part-Hawaiian, allowed passage of 442nd veterans into the party, such as Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga. He lived long enough to see the party that had overthrown the monarchy be dethroned themselves, and to some extent accomplishing what he failed in 1895. During this turbulent time Democrats were divided between right-wing \\"Walkouts\\" led by Ingram Stainback and the left-wing \\"Standpats\\" led by Burns, Wilson was a Standpat. A damaging letter written by Wilson criticizing non-Hawaii-born Democrats alluding to Stainback was considered the major factor in his loss to Republican Neal Blaisdell. During the late 1950s, Wilson advocated that the territorial government build a tunnel through the Ko ªolau Mountains from Honolulu to Kaneohe through Kalihi Valley. The territorial government, however, opted to build the tunnel through the Nu ªuanu Pali. The city eventually proceeded with plans to build a second set of tunnels through Kalihi Valley, which opened in 1961, five years after Wilson's death. The tunnels were named the John H. Wilson Tunnels in his honor. == References == == Further reading == * == External links == * ASCE Hawaii ‚Äì describes Johnny Wilson's early achievements Category:1871 births Category:1956 deaths Category:Hawaii Democrats Category:Mayors of Honolulu Category:Native Hawaiian politicians Category:Native Hawaiian people Category:Hawaiian insurgents and supporters Category: ªIolani School alumni ","title":"John H.

It is the second game in the TimeSplitters series, and a sequel to the original TimeSplitters. The game features a story mode consisting of ten levels in which the player assumes the role of one of two space marines as they attempt to stop the alien race of TimeSplitters from ruining history by collecting the time crystals in various time periods, ranging from the Wild West to the 25th century. It has several multiplayer modes. ==Gameplay== TimeSplitters 2 is a first-person shooter that requires players to kill enemies and complete objectives using a variety of weapons and tactics in different predefined scenarios. Armour and health bars on the sides of the screen lower when the player is shot, which can be increased by walking over body armor and medical kits. The weapons of TimeSplitters 2 include handguns, rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, a grenade launcher, various explosives, a crossbow, a flamethrower, a fire extinguisher and a brick. They are of many different time periods, from the historical to the futuristic. Some weapons have an alternate fire which activates a feature such as launching a grenade or detonating a remote mine. It is possible to dual wield some weapons. ===Story mode=== The main story mode of TimeSplitters 2 is divided into ten levels. Each level is in a different time period and contains a series of objectives that must be completed. Some objectives are present at the start of the level, while others are added during play. A few levels have secondary objectives, which are not required to complete unless on the normal or hard difficulty setting. Each level includes a single checkpoint in the middle where the player can restart if they die or fail to complete an objective (with the exception of the last level on any difficulty and the fourth level on easy). For each level, the player must choose from three difficulty levels. These difficulty levels not only change the strength of the enemies, but also increase the length of the level by adding additional objectives; for instance, in both easy and normal levels, there are optional secondary objectives, whereas in the hard levels, all secondary objectives are now primary and must be completed. At the end of every level, a time crystal must be recovered. After it is picked up, a time portal will appear which must be entered in order to complete the level. However, this is sometimes made more difficult by TimeSplitters that teleport to the player's location. In secret places of certain levels, there are cartridges of old school arcade games such as Snake, that can be picked up and played on the player's Temporal Uplink, the device that normally shows the map of the current level. The game's story mode can be played alone or cooperatively with another player. When playing co-op, in order to balance the game, the two players' health amounts are lowered. Along with the story mode, there are two single-player modes: an Arcade mode and a Challenge mode where a player is given a scenario and must complete it within certain requirements. The objective ranges from collecting bananas to shooting heads off zombies. After the objective is completed, the game will end, and a medal will be awarded depending on the number of points obtained. Certain medals allow the player to play as new characters in multiplayer or use cheats. Cheats can be turned on in the options menu to activate features such as unlimited ammunition or the ability to shoot paintballs. Free Radical's website implies that there are also controller-activated cheats that have never been released. They say they like to keep things \\"as impossible as possible.\\" ===Multiplayer=== Screenshot of the Chicago level. Arcade mode is the main multiplayer section of TimeSplitters 2. It can normally be played with up to four players with each player using a division of the television's screen. However, with a System Link, up to sixteen players can participate. System link was not included with the GameCube version. When a player is killed, they are respawned at a random location on the map with full health. Weapons, armour, and other items that enhance players' abilities are placed in several preset positions scattered about the map. The objective of the game depends on the mode selected. Four are available at the start: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Bag (a version of Capture the Flag) and BagTag (where a player must survive while in possession of the bag for the longest period of time). There are sixteen game modes in total, but twelve are unavailable until the player beats certain levels of the game. Several aspects of multiplayer can be customised, such as the weapons, the number of points needed to win, the number of minutes until the end of the game, as well as the music that plays along with the level. There is also a variety of different characters the player can choose to play as, each with their own individual statistics. Some characters are from the Story mode, while there are other more humorous ones such as a dinosaur and an Elvis impersonator. Up to ten computer-controlled bots can be used. Their appearance, difficulty, and team can be customised. The bots can do some acrobatic moves that the player cannot do such as rolls and somersaults. At the end of each match, the results of the game are shown. This includes the number of points each player or team scored, the weapon the player used most often, as well as awards the player earned. There are nearly 60 awards present in TimeSplitters 2. Players are given them based on what they did in the match. Awards are recorded in each player's profile which also keeps track of a variety of other statistics. There is also an Arcade League mode in which one player is placed in an Arcade match with pre-set bots and weapons. There are three difficulty levels of Arcade League: Amateur, Honorary, and Elite. Players must beat them in consecutive order. After a player beats an Arcade League level, a medal is awarded. A MapMaker is also available that can create playable levels. Levels for Story mode can be made as well as levels for Arcade mode. Created Story levels, however, cannot be played co-operatively. Maps are created by selecting and placing different pre-made tiles and rooms onto a grid. Spawn points, weapons, bags, armour, and objectives can then be placed anywhere on the level. There is a bar in the left side of the screen, representing memory, that lowers each time a tile or item is placed. When the bar depletes completely, nothing else can be placed onto the map. However, items can be deleted to increase memory. A theme can be chosen for each map such as Victorian, Industrial, Alien, and Virtual, which changes how the rooms appear. Only LAN networks are supported, but online play is possible with the use of PCs and third-party networking software. ==Plot== TimeSplitters 2 starts off in the year 2401 in the midst of a war between humanity and the TimeSplitters, an alien race bent on the destruction of mankind. However, rather than use brute force to destroy humanity, they are using the special objects called time crystals to travel through time changing the course of history, bringing Earth to ruin. Two space marines from Earth, Sergeant Cortez and Corporal Hart, are sent out to a space station overrun by TimeSplitters to retrieve the time crystals. However, when they reach the bridge, they are too late as they see the last few TimeSplitters take the time crystals into various time periods using the time portal. While Sergeant Cortez and Corporal Hart are preparing the time portal to follow the Timesplitters, they are attacked by another squad of Timesplitters. Corporal Hart decides to stay at the bridge to keep the Timesplitters at bay while Cortez goes into different periods of time to retrieve the time crystals. Upon arrival at each time period, Cortez takes the form of a person from that particular period of time, similar to Quantum Leap. For example, when Cortez arrives in the Wild West, he takes the form of a bounty hunter. When he arrives in a 24th-century robot factory, he takes the form of a robot. After Cortez retrieves all of the time crystals, he returns to the space station to rendezvous with Hart. The TimeSplitters outside finally manage to break into the bridge. Corporal Hart is killed in the ensuing battle. Cortez has little time to mourn, as the Timesplitters become relentless to retrieve the Time Crystals from him. Cortez manages to set the station to self-destruct and escape before its destruction. This leads into the events of TimeSplitters: Future Perfect. ==Development== In February 1999, 15 months before the release of Perfect Dark, several members of Rare that were part of the GoldenEye 007 development team, including Steve Ellis, Karl Hilton, Graeme Norgate, and David Doak, left to form their own company called Free Radical Design. After they developed the first TimeSplitters, TimeSplitters 2 went into development, trying to create a more fulfilling story mode alongside the Arcade and MapMaker modes. The game was developed over a 23-month period, with around half of that time devoted to creating the opening level. It was also one of the first multi-platform games to be re-released on both the PlayStation 2 Greatest Hits and Xbox Platinum labels. The location of the health bar and other gameplay features are reminiscent of GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark. The game engine present in TimeSplitters 2 is also very similar to the one present in GoldenEye 007. They both contain a similar aiming system and both lack the ability to jump. ===Releases=== There are a few minor differences between the console versions of TimeSplitters 2. For example, the PlayStation 2 version has a smaller playing field for minigames such as Anaconda. This consequently makes high scores on the PlayStation 2 version lower than the Xbox and GameCube versions which both have bigger playing fields for the minigames. There are four different versions of cover art for the North American release of the game. Some of the versions had a unique tag line for the GameCube and Xbox ports. The GameCube version displayed the quote \\"Heir apparent to GoldenEye\\", by Electronic Gaming Monthly. The Xbox version said, \\"First Halo, now this\\". Other versions include the Player's Choice edition and the original release without the quotes. Other release changes include removal of the map editor function and the renaming to Time Splitter: Invaders of the History on the Japanese release of the PlayStation 2 version. In addition, Europe, France, Japan, South Korea, and the United States each have different box art. In PSM3, Doak expressed interest in remaking TimeSplitters 2 with HD visuals and online multiplayer. In an October 2012 interview, Free Radical co-founder Steve Ellis said, \\"We had a \\"HD\\" downloadable version of TimeSplitters 2 in development at Free Radical in 2008. I don't know what happened to that but yes, I'd love to see it released at some point. Maybe it could be the catalyst that is required in order to raise enough interest in TimeSplitters 4 that a publisher might want to fund it.\\" Homefront: The Revolution, a game developed by Deep Silver Dambuster (the corporate successor to Free Radical Design in accordance with British business transfer law due to the closure of Crytek UK), contains an easter egg featuring two playable levels from the game, accessible via an arcade cabinet located in one of the main game's locations. ==Reception== The PlayStation 2 version of TimeSplitters 2 received \\"universal acclaim\\", while the GameCube and Xbox versions received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In comparison to the first game in the series, GamePro called \\"TimeSplitters 2 [...] everything the original game was and more\\" and \\"outdoes most other PS2 shooters in the process\\". GameSpot said that the game \\"may very well be the best split-screen multiplayer-focused first-person shooter ever created.\\" IGN concluded that the game was \\"clearly the best multiplayer first-person shooter on the PlayStation 2\\", but commented that it was not story-driven and little empathy was felt for the characters. GameSpy criticized the absence of online play, but complimented the game's \\"great deathmatching action\\" and the game's high frame rate. They also said the game is \\"everything you could possibly want in a sequel.\\" Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine praised it as \\"easily one of the best first-person shooters out there‚Äîon any system\\", but called its lack of online play \\"criminal.\\" The game has also been compared to GoldenEye 007 because of its many similar game elements, shared developers and references to that game, such as both games beginning on a Siberian dam. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2002 video games Category:Aztecs in fiction Category:Cathedrals in fiction Category:Cooperative video games Category:Eidos Interactive games Category:Experimental medical treatments in fiction Category:First-person shooters Category:Free Radical Design Category:GameCube games Category:Gargoyles in popular culture Category:Jungles in fiction Category:Monkeys in popular culture Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Notre-Dame de Paris Category:Parody video games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:Science fantasy video games Category:Science fiction comedy Category:Split-screen multiplayer games Category:Surreal comedy Category:Temporal war fiction Category:Terrorism in fiction Category:TimeSplitters Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games about size change Category:Video games about viral outbreaks Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games scored by Graeme Norgate Category:Video games set in Chicago Category:Video games set in Guatemala Category:Video games set in Paris Category:Video games set in the Soviet Union Category:Video games set in the United States Category:Video games set in Tokyo Category:Video games set on fictional islands Category:Video games set on fictional planets Category:Western (genre) video games Category:Xbox games Category:Zombie video games ","title":"TimeSplitters 2"},{"id":"824790","text":"Richard Galliano (born December 12, 1950, Cannes, Alpes-Maritimes) is a French accordionist of Italian heritage. [ Allmusic biography] ==Biography== Photo by Andrea Colombara He was drawn to music at an early age, starting with the accordion at 4, influenced by his father Luciano, an accordionist originally from Italy, living in Nice. After a long and intense period of study (he took up lessons on the trombone, harmony, and counterpoint at the Academy of Music in Nice), at 14, in a search to expand his ideas on the accordion, he began listening to jazz and heard records by the trumpet player Clifford Brown. \\"I copied all the choruses of Clifford Brown, impressed by his tone and his drive, his way of phrasing over the thunderous playing of Max Roach\\". Fascinated by this new world, Richard was amazed that the accordion had never been part of this musical adventure. In this period, Galliano won twice the first prize in the \\"world accordion cap competition\\" which took place in Spain (1966) and France (1967). In the Spanish competition, the participants' duty work was \\"Chaconne\\" by the Israeli accordionist Yehuda Oppenheimer. Galliano and Oppenheimer kept up their musical collaboration and personal friendship until Oppenheimer's death in 2012. Some later collaborations include Astor Piazolla, George Mraz, Brigitte Fontaine, Al Foster, Juliette Gr√©co, Charles Aznavour, Ron Carter, Chet Baker, Enrico Rava, Martial Solal, Miroslav Vitou≈°, Trilok Gurtu, Jan Garbarek, Michel Petrucciani, Michel Portal, Eddy Louiss, Bir√©li Lagr√®ne, Sylvain Luc, Renaud Garcia-Fons, Ivan Paduart, Anouar Brahem, Wynton Marsalis, and Toots Thielemans.

It grows in one layer on the edge of the eyelids. Eyelashes protect the eye from debris, dust and small particles and perform some of the same functions as whiskers do on a cat or a mouse in the sense that they are sensitive to being touched, thus providing a warning that an object (such as a bug) is near the eye (which then closes reflexively). The Ancient Greek word for eyelash is Œ≤ŒªŒ≠œÜŒ±œÅŒøŒΩ (transliterated as blepharon), which is seen as a root in biological terms like Blephara. ==StructureDevelopment=== The eyelashes of the human embryo develop from the ectoderm between the 22nd and 26th week of pregnancy. Natural eyelashes do not grow beyond a certain length, and fall off by themselves without any need for trimming. Eyelashes take about seven to eight weeks to grow back if pulled out, but constant pulling may lead to permanent damage. Their color may differ from that of the hair, although they tend to be dark on someone with dark hair and lighter on someone with light hair. Eyelash hair is not androgenic and is therefore not affected by puberty. ===Glands=== The follicles of eyelashes are associated with a number of glands known as the glands of Zeis and the glands of Moll. ==Clinical significance== A stye There are a number of diseases or disorders involving the eyelashes: *Madarosis is the loss of eyelashes. *Blepharitis is the irritation of the lid margin, where eyelashes join the eyelid. The eyelids are red and itching, the skin often becomes flaky, and the eyelashes may fall out. *Distichiasis is the abnormal growth of lashes from certain areas of the eyelid. *Trichiasis refers to ingrown eyelashes. *Eyelashes may become infested with parasitic crab louse. *An external hordeolum, or stye, is a purulent inflammation of infected eyelash follicles and surrounding sebaceous (Gland of Zeis) and apocrine (Moll's gland) glands of the lid margin. *Trichotillomania is a disorder that urges the sufferer to pull out scalp hair, eyelashes, etc. *Demodex folliculorum (or the demodicid) is a small mite that lives harmlessly in eyelash and other hair follicles, and about 20% of people have these mites living on them. Occasionally they may cause blepharitis. Eyelash and eyebrow transplant surgeries may help to reconstruct or thicken lashes or eyebrow hair. ==Society and cultureCosmetics=== Green mascara Long eyelashes are considered a sign of beauty in many cultures. Accordingly, some women seek to enhance their eyelash length artificially, using eyelash extensions. On the other hand, Hadza women are known to trim their own eyelashes. Kohl, a black putty (usually antimony sulfide or lead sulfide), has been worn as far back as the Bronze Age to darken the edge of the eyelid (just at the bottom of the eyelashes). In Ancient Egypt, it was used as well by the wealthy and the royal to beautify their eyes. Modern eye makeup includes mascara, eyeliner, eye putty, and eye shadow to emphasize the eyes. The twentieth century saw the beginning of convincing false eyelashes, popular in the 1960s. There are also different tools that can be used on the lashes such as eyelash curler or mascara shield (also named mascara guard or eye makeup helper). Permanent eyelash tints and eyelash extensions have also become popular procedures, even in fairly basic salons. It is also possible to get eyelash transplants, which are similar in nature to hair transplantation often done on the head. Since the hair is transplanted from the hair on the head, the new eyelashes will continue to grow like head hair and will need to be trimmed regularly. Latisse was introduced in the first quarter of 2009 by Allergan as the first drug to receive FDA approval for eyelash growth. Latisse is a solution of bimatoprost, the active component of the glaucoma medication Lumigan. According to Allergan, noticeable eyelash growth occurs within 16 weeks. Growth is reported to occur primarily on the upper eyelashes. In addition, the past decade has seen the rapid increase in the development of eyelash conditioners. These conditioners are designed to increase the health and length of lashes. Many utilize seed extract, minerals, and other chemicals to achieve these results. Cosmetic companies have recently relied on scientific research of prostaglandins and the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathways to develop eyelash products. Although bimatoprost is effective in promoting increased growth of healthy eyelashes and adnexal hairs, its effectiveness in patients with eyelash alopecia areata is debatable. ==In other animals== A horse's eye, showing lashes Lashes, being hair, are found in mammals. Camels' lashes are remarkably long and thick. Horses and cows feature eyelashes as well. Inherited eyelash problems are common in some breeds of dogs as well as horses. Eyelashes are an uncommon but not unknown feature in birds. Hornbills have prominent eyelashes (vestigial feathers with no barbs), as do ostriches. Amongst the reptiles, only Eyelash vipers show a set of modified scales over the eyes which look much like eyelashes. ==See also== *Eyelash extensions, used to enhance the length, curliness, fullness, and thickness of natural eyelashes ==References== ==External links== * Category:Facial features ","title":"Eyelash"},{"id":"824849","text":"This is a list of places in the United States named for Lewis Cass: == Counties == * Cass County, Illinois * Cass County, Indiana * Cass County, Iowa * Cass County, Michigan * Cass County, Minnesota * Cass County, Missouri * Cass County, Nebraska * Cass County, Texas In addition, Bartow County, Georgia was formerly Cass County, until after the American Civil War.

Experiment was built in 1799 at Baltimore, Maryland; and first put to sea late in November 1799, Lieutenant W. Maley in command. Experiment joined the squadron commanded by Captain Silas Talbot on the Santo Domingo station, and for seven months, cruised against French privateers in the Caribbean, taking a number of valuable prizes. On 1 January 1800, while becalmed in the Bight of Leogane with a convoy of four merchantmen, Experiment was attacked by 11 armed pirate boats, manned by about four or five hundred buccaneers. In the seven hours of fighting that followed, the pirates boarded one of the merchantmen, killing her captain, and towed off two other ships of the convoy after their crews had abandoned them. But Experiment sank two of the attacking craft, and killed and wounded many of the pirates, suffering only one man wounded. Arriving in the Delaware River early in July 1800, Experiment refitted, and returned to the West Indies. Again successful in her patrols against the French, she captured several armed vessels, one of which was carrying a high-ranking army officer. She also recaptured a number of American merchantmen, and in January 1801 rescued 65 Spaniards from the ship Eliza, wrecked on a reef of the island of Saona. Experiment returned to Norfolk early in February 1801, and was laid up there until August, when she sailed to Baltimore. There, she was sold in October 1801. ==References== * Category:Schooners of the United States Navy Category:Quasi-War ships of the United States Category:1799 ships ","title":"USS Experiment (1799)"},{"id":"824861","text":"Interurban 2115 toy train in the permanent collection of The Children‚Äôs Museum of Indianapolis.

The name 419 comes from \\"419 fraud\\", another name for advance fee fraud, and itself derived from the relevant section of the Nigerian criminal code. The website founder, Michael Berry, goes by the alias Shiver Metimbers. As of 2013, the 419 Eater forum had over 55,000 registered accounts. According to one member, \\"Every minute the scammer I'm communicating with is spending on me is a minute he is not scamming a real potential victim.\\" ==Concept== The website chronicles various reverse scams, known as \\"baits,\\" with e-mail exchanges between the baiters and the scammers, and commentary by the participants. The site hosts photographs of individuals reported to be scammers in humorous poses, or holding signs such as \\"I recommend 419eater\\". These photographs, according to the members who post them, were in most cases obtained during the process of a bait: the baiter, posing as an actual victim, will request the photos from the scammer, who will comply in the belief that the \\"victim\\" is about to fall for the scam and send money. In some cases, the scambaiter claims to have had the scammers send them money with a ploy similar to the original flim flam. This is known informally as cash baiting. According to Berry as documented in some of his successful cash baits, the proceeds of such reverse scams were given to a local charity. Now however, cash-baiting is frowned upon and is against 419eater.com rules, which are rigorously enforced. The website also includes a message forum and a bulletin board where scambaiters can post messages to communicate with each other. New scambaiters can request to be assigned a \\"mentor\\" to assist them in learning how to bait. The 419eater community previously engaged in the activity of identifying and removing fake banks and other websites created by the scammers from the Internet, as well as shutting down bank accounts used by scammers in the process of their illegal scamming activities. It did this in cooperation with Artists Against 419, which hosts a large, publicly accessible database of fake banks and similar fraudulent websites. In 2020, Artists Against 419 severed its ties with 419eater.com and the Fake Site forum is now locked https://forum.419eater.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=303663 During their baiting activities, experienced members may often gain information on victims of scams. This information is used constructively in the battle against the scammers. ==Notable events in the timeline of the site== Berry was a featured guest on BBC Radio 2's The Jeremy Vine Show on November 1, 2006. Berry has also collected some of the scambaits shown on the website, in a book Greetings in Jesus' Name!: The Scambaiter Letters. In early 2008, Berry retired from active involvement in 419eater.com to concentrate on work and other projects, handing control over to one of the site's long-running system administrators. Beginning September 6, 2007, the 419eater.com website‚Äîamong other \\"scam warning\\" websites‚Äîwas subjected to a massive botnet DDoS attack which rendered the site unreachable. However, by September 18, 2007, the site and forums were both back online. 419eater and its operatives were profiled on the September 12, 2008 episode of Public Radio International's This American Life, specifically one particular bait that ran for 100 days starting in April 2008 and involved sending a scammer named Adamu from Lagos, Nigeria to Ab√©ch√©, Chad, a dangerous and politically unstable region. 419eater.com was quoted as saying \\"When the scammer sends you a fake passport that looks like it was made by a blind hamster with a piece of charcoal in ten seconds, you praise it and say it really helps you to build trust\\". Several baiters \\"talked a scammer into traveling from Port Harcourt, Nigeria to Darfur to pick up a nonexistent $500,000. The 3,000-mile roundtrip got the scammer stranded for two weeks before he managed to make it home\\". Although the work of 419eater.com baiters does put scammers in danger, \\"the general consensus...was that they feel even the most dangerous of safaris is payback for all the scammers do. 'The scammer makes the decision to put themselves in harm's way; if something happens to them, so be it. Most of them would have no problem with you dying if it meant that they would make a dollar'\\". Another baiter was quoted as saying \\"Whether he is wandering through the desert hundreds of miles from home, or making yet another fruitless trip to the Moneygram office, that's all time he is not behind a computer scamming someone's elderly parents.\\" In January 2014, members of 419eater.com appeared in two segments of the Channel 4 series Secrets of the Scammers. In the first segment, scambaiters persuaded a scammer to travel from London to a remote location in Cornwall by train and taxi, to meet a victim (played by a baiter) and collect payment for a gold deal. In the second segment, a female scammer met with two scambaiters posing as victims in Trafalgar Square, to pass them a fake check. This scammer was subsequently questioned by the police.Secrets of the Scammers on YouTube In November 2014, members of 419eater.com appeared in a segment of the CBC Television series Dot.Con. During the segment, a scambaiter persuaded a scammer to travel from Paris to a remote location in Cornwall by air and taxi, to meet a victim (played by a baiter) and collect payment for a gold deal. Following this, two scammers travelled from London and met with a scambaiter posing as a victim in Plymouth to collect upfront payment for delivery of a trunk box of cash.Dot.Con on YouTube ==See also== *Scam baiting *Advance fee fraud ==References== ==External links== *419eater.com (Mobile) *The 419eater forum *\\"Turning the tables on Nigeria's e-mail conmen\\", 13 July 2004, BBC News *Greetings in Jesus Name!: The Scambaiter Letters *\\"Pining for the frauds: scammers act up\\", February 20, 2007, The Sydney Morning Herald *A Web Cadre Turns the Tables on African Scam Artists, The New York Times *Scam Baiting Technic *Baiting Nigerian scammers for fun (not so much for profit) Category:Social engineering (computer security) Category:Spamming Category:Internet vigilantism Category:Pranksters Category:British comedy websites ","title":"419eater.com"},{"id":"824876","text":"Main building The Federal University of Rond√¥nia' (', UNIR) is located in the state of Rond√¥nia, in Brazil.

Consequently, the colony was crowded with British soldiers, sailors and airmen. They received wide support from the Governor, General Mason-MacFarlane (later a Labour MP in the United Kingdom), who allowed them to fulfil the representative role that the Committee of the Exchange and the Commercial Library used to fill. The Governor also left the AACR with the responsibility of managing the leave scheme that allowed the Gibraltarians who remained on the Rock to visit their families in Britain. They also took a leading role in the repatriation of the Gibraltarian evacuees. Joshua Hassan, longest running leader of the AACR and Chief Minister of Gibraltar for 18 years. In 1945 the AACR became a political party, advocating improved pay and working conditions and the introduction of a democratic constitution. In August 1945, the first City Council elections since the war were held and the AACR won all the elected seats in the Council, with Hassan became its chairman. In the first elections to the new legislature in 1950, it won three of the five seats and was able to form a government.McHale, pp326‚Äì327 The party won successive elections in 1953 and 1956. The 1959 elections saw it win only three of the seven seats, but with the other four held by independents, it was able to continue in government. This was repeated after the 1964 elections, but the results of the 1969 elections (when it added \\"Gibraltar Labour Party\\" to its name) saw two new parties, the Integration with Britain Party and Isola Group win eight of the 15 seats between them, allowing them to form a government. After a member of the Isola Group defected in 1972, early elections were called, which saw the AACR win eight of the 15 seats and return to government. The party won subsequent elections in 1976 and 1980. After victory in the 1984 elections Hassan resigned without completing his term as Chief Minister in 1987 after an agreement on the shared use of Gibraltar Airport was signed by Spain and the United Kingdom, citing personal reasons. He was succeeded by the then Deputy Chief Minister, Adolfo Canepa. However, Canepa lost the 1988 election to Joe Bossano of the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party (GSLP), winning only seven seats and forming the opposition in 1988. In 1992 they failed to return to power and were effectively dissolved thereafter. The last election with an AACR candidate was the 1998 by-election following the death of Robert Mor of the GLSP. The AACR candidate John Piris received only 337 votes and was defeated by Joseph Garcia of the Gibraltar Liberal Party (GLP), backed by the GSLP. ==Ideology== Until the 1960s the party was linked with the Gibraltar Confederation of Labour, which it had founded. However, the links with unions began to weaken thereafter. The party had a pragmatic and progressive policy platform, and aimed to strengthen relations with Britain, but also give the territory freedom. This was reflected in its campaign slogan \\"With Britain, but not under Britain\\".McHale, p324 Like all other major Gibraltar political parties, it opposed transfer of sovereignty over Gibraltar from the United Kingdom to Spain. ==Gibraltar Award== On 10 December 2007 the Self Determination for Gibraltar Group awarded the founding fathers of the AACR with the Gibraltar Award in recognition of their contribution to the political development, democratisation and emancipation of Gibraltar.

Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series of films. Though he made only three theatrical appearances, Cecil has the unusual distinction in that he is one of the very few characters who was able to outsmart Bugs Bunny, and the only one to do so three times in a row and at the rabbit's own game. ==HistoryTortoise Beats Hare=== Animator Tex Avery introduced Cecil in the short Tortoise Beats Hare, released on March 15, 1941. Even from the cartoon's opening titles, Avery lets on that Bugs Bunny is about to meet his match. Bugs wanders onto the screen munching his obligatory carrot and absent-mindedly begins reading the title card, grossly mispronouncing most of the credits, such as for \\"Avery\\" rather than the correct . When he finally gets to the title itself, he becomes outraged, tears apart the title card, and rushes to Cecil Turtle's house. He then bets the little, sleepy-eyed turtle ten dollars that he can beat him in a race. Cecil accepts Bugs' bet, and the race begins several days later. Bugs races away at top speed just before finishing the shout of, \\"Get on your mark, get set, go!\\" Cecil quickly (for him, anyway) goes to a public telephone and calls up Chester Turtle, one of his relatives. After talking to Chester about the bet, he tells him to call \\"the boys\\" (cousins), and tell them to be ready when he comes to their position, and to \\"give him the works\\". Chester calls the relatives, all of whom look and sound like Cecil (some have deeper voices, some have higher voices), and relays the message. As Bugs runs relentlessly toward the finish line, Cecil and the other turtles take turns showing up at just the right moment to baffle the bunny. In the end, Bugs is convinced he has won, only to see Cecil (or one of his kin) across the finish demanding the money. Bugs suggests that he has been tricked, and all nine turtles approach and reply, \\"It's a possibility!\\" Voice actor Mel Blanc supplies Cecil's drowsy drawl, which is like a slowed-down version of Blanc's later characterization of Barney Rubble. \\"Tortoise Beats Hare\\" follows one of the many folk variants of the Aesop fable \\"The Tortoise and the Hare\\" in which the faster beast is deceived by look-alikes placed along the course.Aarne- Thompson-Uther type 275 http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0275.html More directly, it is Avery's parody of the 1935 Disney Silly Symphony, The Tortoise and the Hare. Avery left Warner Bros. before he could produce any new cartoons featuring Cecil. However, he introduced a similar character in 1943 named Droopy Dog. Droopy would even take some of his tricks from his slow-and-steady predecessor, such as using his relatives to help him outsmart a wolf. ===Tortoise Wins by a Hare=== Bob Clampett took Avery's scenario and altered it for his film Tortoise Wins by a Hare released on February 20, 1943. The title is an appropriate pun on \\"hair\\". Bugs again challenges Cecil to a race after viewing footage from their previous encounter two years earlier (which seems to depict Cecil as having won fairly instead of by cheating Bugs with his cousins). Bugs then goes to Cecil's tree home disguised as an old man (a parody of Bill Thompson's \\"Old Timer\\" character from the radio series Fibber McGee and Molly) to ask the turtle his secret. Cecil, not in the least bit fooled by the disguise remarks, \\"Clean livin', friend. Clean livin'...\\". And then reveals his streamlined shell lets him win, and produces a set of blueprints for his \\"air-flow chassis\\". The turtle ends the conversation with the comment, \\"Oh, and another thing... Rabbits aren't very bright, either!\\" just before slamming the door in the enraged bunny's face. Not getting the hint that the turtle's story is a humbug, Bugs builds the device and prepares for the race. Meanwhile, a bunny mob learns of the upcoming match-up and places all its bets on Bugs. (\\"In fact, we don't even think that the toitle will finish... Do we, boys?\\" \\"Duh, no, Boss, no!\\") The race begins, and Bugs still outpaces his reptilian rival. However, in his new get-up, the dim-witted gangsters mistake him for the turtle. Cecil reinforces this misconception by dressing in a gray rabbit suit and munching on some delicious carrots. The mobsters thus make the shelled Bugs' run a nightmare, ultimately giving the race to Cecil (in an aside to the audience, as the rabbits cheer him, Cecil remarks \\"I told you rabbits aren't very bright!\\"). When Bugs removes the chassis and sobbingly reveals that he's the rabbit, the rabbit gangsters remark, in mock-Bugsy style, \\"Ehhh, now he tells us!\\" and commit suicide by shooting themselves with a single bullet that goes through the sides of all of their apparently soft heads. (The final gag is often cut when shown on basic cable television, but can be found uncut on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1.) ===Rabbit Transit=== Cecil and Bugs would have one final match up in Friz Freleng's cartoon, Rabbit Transit, released on May 10, 1947. The title is a play of Rapid Transit. Unlike Tortoise Wins by a Hare, this cartoon presumes that Bugs and Cecil have never met before now. While relaxing in a steam bath, Bugs reads about the original fable and, as he did reading the credits of Tortoise Beats Hare, becomes incensed at the idea of a turtle outrunning a rabbit. Cecil, also in the steam bath, claims that he could outrun Bugs, prompting Bugs to challenge him to a race (again, as in Tortoise Beats Hare, although at least here Bugs receives some provocation). This time, Bugs and Cecil agree to no cheating. Cecil, however, quickly reveals that his shell is now rocket propelled, allowing him to go a surprising combination between fast and slow. Bugs does his best to steal, dismantle, and destroy the device, but all to little effect. In the end, however, Bugs does manage to top the turtle and crosses the finish line first. Nevertheless, it is Cecil who has the last laugh when he rooks the rabbit into confessing to \\"doing 100 easy\\"‚Äîin a 30-miles-per-hour zone. Bugs is taken away by the police to enjoy his victory ‚Äî behind bars. Cecil closes out the cartoon by saying Bugs' famous line, \\"Ain't I a...um... a stinker?\\" Iris-out. ==Other appearances== The Warners directors retired Cecil after his third showdown with Bugs. Nevertheless, Cecil has made occasional cameos in later projects. He is seen briefly in the 1996 film Space Jam and the 2003 DVD Looney Tunes: Reality Check, voiced by Joe Alaskey. He also made a cameo in one episode of The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries, voiced by Frank Welker. He features in some issues of the Looney Tunes comic book. His only notable Warner Bros. Animation Looney Tunes short cameo came in 1954's Devil May Hare, which was directed by Robert McKimson and pitted Bugs against the Tasmanian Devil, who made his debut here. Cecil Turtle appears in The Looney Tunes Show, voiced by Jim Rash. He and Bugs are once again enemies like in the classic shorts, and he has a habit of mispronouncing Bugs's name as \\"Buges Buney.\\" In Cecil's appearances on this show, he is the one who gets outwitted by Bugs, the first time in Looney Tunes history. His next appearance was in the episode The Shell Game. Now working as a scammer, Cecil tricks both Bugs and Porky into thinking they damaged his shell. However, Bugs started seeing through Cecil's con, and confronted him with Porky and took down his shell scam and sending him to prison, as well as scoring another victory over Cecil. Cecil also appears in the spinoff film Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run, voiced again by Rash and appearing as a spy working for the Mexican general Foghorn Leghorn. Cecil makes recurring appearances in New Looney Tunes, voiced by series producer Matt Craig. ==References== ==External links== * Cecil image gallery * WAV file of Cecil's voice Category:Looney Tunes characters Category:Fictional turtles Category:Male characters in animation Category:Film characters introduced in 1941 ","title":"Cecil Turtle"},{"id":"824992","text":"Kenneth \\"Ken\\" Lerner (born May 27, 1948) is an American television, stage and film actor.

Commerce raiding (, \\"war of the chase\\"; , \\"trade war\\") is a form of naval warfare used to destroy or disrupt logistics of the enemy on the open sea by attacking its merchant shipping, rather than engaging its combatants or enforcing a blockade against them. ==Privateering== The first sort of commerce raiding was for nations to commission privateers. Early instances of this type of warfare were by the English and Dutch against the Spanish treasure fleets of the 16th century, which resulted in financial gain for both captain and crew upon capture of enemy vessels (\\"prizes\\"). ===17th and 18th centuries=== Privateers formed a large part of the total military force at sea during the 17th and 18th centuries. In the First Anglo-Dutch War, English privateers attacked the trade on which the United Provinces entirely depended, capturing over 1,000 Dutch merchant ships. During the subsequent war with Spain, Spanish and Flemish privateers in the service of the Spanish Crown, including the notorious Dunkirkers, captured 1,500 English merchant ships, helping to restore Dutch international trade.Spanish Privateers Dutch privateers and others also attacked British trade, whether coastal, Atlantic, or Mediterranean, in the Second and Third Anglo-Dutch wars. During the Nine Years' War, French policy strongly encouraged privateers, including the famous Jean Bart, to attack English and Dutch shipping. England lost roughly 4,000 merchant ships during the war.Privateering and the Private Production of Naval Power, by Gary M. Anderson and Adam Gifford Jr. In the following War of Spanish Succession, privateer attacks continued, Britain losing 3,250 merchant ships.Brewer, John. The Sinews of Power: War, Money, and the English State, 1688-1783 (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1989), p.197. Parliament passed an updated Cruisers and Convoys Act in 1708, allocating regular warships to the defence of trade. In the War of Austrian Succession, the Royal Navy was able to concentrate more on defending British ships. Britain lost 3,238 merchantmen, a smaller fraction of her merchant marine than the enemy losses of 3,434. While French losses were proportionally severe, the smaller but better-protected Spanish trade suffered the least, and Spanish privateers enjoyed much of the best allied plunder of British trade, particularly in the West Indies. ==Napoleonic Wars== During Britain's wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France, the Royal Navy dominated the seas. France adopted a guerre de course strategy by licensing civilian privateers to seize British shipping. British East Indiamen of the time were therefore heavily armed to protect themselves against such raids, at the cost of considerable speed and maneuverability. Some East Indiamen, such as , were successfully able to fend off these attacks in other parts of the world; others, such as when Kent met Confiance in 1800, were less fortunate. U.S. and British privateers also actively raided each other's shipping during the War of 1812. ==American Civil War== During the American Civil War, the Confederate Navy operated a fleet of commissioned Confederate States Navy commerce raiders. These differed from privateers as they were state-owned ships with orders to destroy enemy commerce rather than privately owned ships with letters of marque. These included Sumter, Florida, Alabama, and Shenandoah. Most of the ships used in this period were built in Britain, which resulted in the Alabama Claims. ==Steel navies== By the 1880s, the navies of Europe began to deploy warships made of iron and steel. The natural evolution that followed was the installation of more powerful guns to penetrate the new steel warships. No longer would navies fight for \\"prizes\\", in which capture of the enemy warship meant financial gain for captain and crew as well as government when the prize and her cargo were auctioned. The advent of steel armor and high explosive and armor-piercing shells meant the destruction and sinking of enemy \\"men o' war\\" was the priority. First seen at the Sinope in 1853, the change was little appreciated until 1905, when at Tsushima seven pre-dreadnoughts were sent to the bottom, and the only prizes were those that had voluntarily surrendered. ==World War I== World War I saw Germany conducting a commerce war (\\"Handelskrieg\\") against Britain and her allies, principally with U-boats, but also with merchant raiders and light cruisers, and even occasionally with naval airships.Lehmann Chapter VI ==World War II== During World War II, the Battle of the Atlantic saw Nazi Germany conducting guerre de course against Britain and its allies, again using U-boats, auxiliary cruisers, and small groups of cruisers and battleships (raiders). Limitations set by the Treaty of Versailles meant Germany could not build a large battle fleet as she had in the time leading up to the World War I, and chose to covertly develop her submarines instead. U-boats were cheaper and quicker to build than capital ships, and consequently Germany built up a submarine force rather than a surface fleet. This meant Germany was not able to fight a war of \\"guerre d'escadre (battles between fleets), and therefore pursued guerre de course; what small numbers of surface warships Germany possessed, such as the s, as well as her auxiliary cruisers, also participated in this strategy. In addition, a number of commercial vessels were converted, perhaps the most famous being . During World War II, elements of the United States Navy based in Brazil conducted operations in the Atlantic against German commerce raiders and blockade runners. In the Pacific, the U.S. Navy operated against Japanese merchant shipping, as well as engaging in offensive operations against ships of the Japanese Imperial Navy. The bulk of the Japanese merchant marine was sunk by American submarines. By the end of the war, only 12% of Japan's pre- war merchant tonnage was still afloat. The Indian Ocean raid was a naval sortie by the Carrier Striking Task Force of the Japanese Navy from 31 March to 10 April 1942 against Allied shipping and bases in the Indian Ocean. It was an early engagement of the Pacific campaign of World War II. The staff of the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to send some raiders to Indian Ocean waters during December 12, 1941 ‚Äì July 12, 1942. The Germans had already been operating in the area and conducted mutual aid with Japanese submarines, in the form of re-supply and military intelligence. The Indian Ocean was the largest operating area involving direct contact between the two Axis partners, in which their primary objective was to keep pressure on the shipping lanes. The Japanese Navy participated in some commerce raiding, but concentrated its efforts toward a \\"decisive battle\\" in the Pacific, which never took place. ==See also== * Axis naval activity in Australian waters * Demoralization (warfare) * German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis * Indian Ocean raid * Japanese raiders in Indian Ocean Campaign * Merchant raider * Naval strategy * Piracy * Privateer * Q-ship * Tonnage war * Unrestricted submarine warfare ==Notes and references== * Lehmann, Ernst A.; Mingos, Howard.

He previously held the posts of Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry and Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in the cabinet of Junichiro Koizumi. He was regarded as one of Japan's most attractive public figures. On 4 October 2009, he was found dead in his Tokyo apartment. The cause of his death is yet to be determined; although no suicide note was found, there was also no indication of foul play. ==Early life and education== Nakagawa was born in Tokyo on 19 July 1953 and attended Azabu High School, graduated from the law faculty of the University of Tokyo and entered the Industrial Bank of Japan in 1978. His father, Ichiro Nakagawa, was a prominent Hokkaid≈ç politician who committed suicide in 1983. The younger Nakagawa was elected to the Japanese House of Representatives in the same year. ==Political career== In 1998, Nakagawa became Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries under Prime Minister Keiz≈ç Obuchi, and in 2003, he became Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry in the cabinet of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. He served as Agriculture Minister from October 2005 to September 2006, when incoming prime minister Shinz≈ç Abe appointed Nakagawa as chairman of the Policy Research Council of the LDP. In December 2006, Kyodo News Agency quoted Nakagawa as having said the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were \\"truly unforgivable on humanitarian grounds\\" and reported the politician's concerns over the possession of nuclear weapons by North Korea. Discussing Market Access of US beef and the Doha Round. Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer and Shoichi Nakagawa, Parliamentary Member, Liberal Democratic Party, Japan discuss market access of US beef and the Doha Round, 2 May 2008 Nakagawa's views were close to those of Abe. In particular, both support nationalism in history education, a hard-line stance regarding North Korea and constitutional amendments. Abe has made efforts to relink ties with neighbouring China, while Nakagawa officially voiced his concern over the country's growing military expenditure, claiming that, were the situation in Taiwan to deteriorate, Japan would become, by 2020, a Chinese colony. Yahoo! World News, 26 February 2007 Despite that most of the mainstream conservative LDP politicians are usually known for their persistent pro-Americanism, Nakagawa was especially known for his pro-Taiwanism in Japan.Âè∞Êπæ„É°„Éá„Ç£„Ç¢„ÅåÁèæÊîøÊ®©„ÄéÈ¢®Ââç„ÅÆ„Å®„ÇÇ„Åó„Å≥„Äè 17 February 2009 Nikkan Sports On 6 January 2007, in an interview with a reporter from the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph, Nakagawa stated \\"Women have their proper place: they should be womanly ...

The paper's Editorial Information Executive could not confirm the source of this information because of the age of the article. On 2 May 2008, Nakagawa had a discussion about market access of US beef and the Doha Round with Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer. In the Cabinet of Prime Minister Taro Aso, appointed on 24 September 2008, Nakagawa was appointed as Minister of Finance and Minister of State in charge of Financial Services.\\"Aso elected premier / Announces Cabinet lineup himself; poll likely on Nov. 2\\" The Yomiuri Shimbun, 25 September 2008 He was defeated in his constituency in the 2009 general election. ==Contribution to IMF== Sh≈çichi Nakagawa with Timothy F. Geithner, United States Secretary of the Treasury (Rome, 13 February 2009) On 10 October 2008, at G7 Nakagawa proposed in Washington a new emergency International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan program to help emerging and small economies such as Iceland, Brazil, Ukraine and Pakistan. The total size of the loans could be about US$200 billion (about 20 trillion yen) In some newly emerging economies and small and medium European countries, total assets in domestic financial institutions far exceed the national gross domestic products and those governments might be unable to raise necessary funds to help failing financial institutions through measures such as nationalisation. \\"Nakagawa plan\\" eased the concerns of small countries and emerging markets and reduced tension in international financial markets. Sh≈çichi Nakagawa with Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, IMF (Rome, 14 February 2009) On 14 February 2009, Strauss-Kahn stated 'This commitment is the single-largest supplemental financing contribution by an IMF member country ever, and it clearly demonstrates Japan's leadership and continuing commitment to a multilateral approach to global economic and financial challenges.' Strauss- Kahn said he hoped other countries would join Japan in providing support to the 185-nation institution. Prime Minister Taro Aso told Japan was ready to lend up to $100 billion from our foreign reserves to the IMF if it finds itself with insufficient funds to help emergency economies. Nikkei Business Daily reported that selling U.S. government bonds held by Japan to provide cash to the IMF would affect U.S. bond yields so Tokyo may consider lending U.S. government bonds to the IMF as collateral for it to raise funds. In a communiqu√©, G-7 ministers committed to acting jointly to support world growth and employment and strengthen the financial sector, while avoiding protectionism. The ministers met as the U.S. Senate voted in favor of a $787 billion economic stimulus plan‚Äîclearing the way for it to be signed into law by President Barack Obama. Strauss-Kahn emphasized \\"The biggest concrete result of this summit is the loan by the Japanese.... I want to thank the Japanese for having led the way.... Now I will continue with the objective of doubling the (IMF) resources,\\" he told reporters. \\"It is the largest loan ever made in the history of humanity.\\" Loans were made to a number of economies affected by the crisis, including Belarus, Hungary, Iceland, Latvia, Pakistan, Serbia, and Ukraine. It announced a precautionary loan for El Salvador last month and an IMF team has also been in negotiations with Turkey. ==Stance on the comfort women issue== Affiliated to the openly revisionist organization Nippon Kaigi,\\"Abe‚Äôs reshuffle promotes right-wingers\\" (Korea Joongang Daily - 2014/09/05) Nakagawa expressed in July 1998 his skepticism about the fact that many schools in Japan taught about forced \\"comfort women\\" by the Japanese military during the World War II in history textbooks claiming that there was no evidence that the Japanese government and military were directory involved in recruiting or forcing women to work in the brothels. :\\"We admit that there were comfort women who traveled with the military,\\" Nakagawa said. \\"Poverty and other issues were behind this development, which is quite tragic and sad. It's a sad fact that similar phenomena existed in other parts of the world, including the U.S.\\" Nakagawa had an opposing position to Y≈çhei K≈çno's statement that the Japanese government was directly involved in recruiting and forcing \\"comfort women\\" to work in the brothels. He stated in a radio program that he wouldn't acknowledge K≈çno's statement as long as the current Japanese government concealed what he thought to be the truth. He added that K≈çno had a masochistic view of history and that other countries would even fake their pride for their own countries. He suggested the government amend or withdraw K≈çno's statement about \\"comfort women\\" immediately. ==Alcohol controversy== Nakagawa had been known for his extremely heavy drinking since a young age. A Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (Japan) bureaucrat, who was a fellow of Nakagawa's, witnessed Nakagawa drunk frequently, especially before hosting big political conferences.„É§„ÉûÂ†¥„Å´„Å™„Çã„Å®È£≤„Åæ„Åö„Å´„ÅÑ„Çâ„Çå„Å™„ÅÑ‚Ä¶‰∏≠Â∑ùÊ∞è„ÄÅÂ§±ÊÖã„ÅÑ„Çç„ÅÑ„Çç 18 February 2009 Yomiuri Shimbun During the G7 meeting of finance ministers in Rome on 14 February 2009, where he signed an agreement to lend an extra $100 billion to the IMF that was described as the \\"largest loan ever made in the history of humanity\\",IMF Survey: IMF Gains New Funding, Puts Focus on Bank Clean Up IMF Nakagawa was seen to be slurring his words.\\"Japanese finance minister denies he was drunk at G-7\\" International Herald Tribune, February 16, 2009 Nakagawa claimed that his drowsiness and slurred speech were the result of taking too much cold medicine before the meeting.

AARNet built the Internet in Australia. In 1995, the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee (AVCC) transferred AARNet1 as a going concern to Telstra who then operated it as the initial Telstra Internet. Today, AARNet is Australia's National research and education network (NREN). It forms the Australian component of the global advanced research and education Internet network. AARNet Pty Ltd, which owns and operates the AARNet, is a not-for- profit company limited by shares. The shareholders are 38 Australian universities and the Australian CSIRO. AARNet's services in addition to Internet connectivity include Eduroam, voice, video and data storage services and a content mirror. ==History== The AARNet network as at October 1993 AARNet was initially built between the University of Melbourne in Melbourne, where the international Internet feed initially landed, and university and CSIRO facilities in all Australian state capital cities and the Australian National University in Canberra. AARNet was formed in 1989 by the Australian Vice- Chancellors' Committee (AVCC). In 1989, Kevin Robert Elz established the first permanent Internet feed to Australia, at the University of Melbourne. Until this time, researchers within Australia had limited access to the ARPANET, due to the high expense of providing communications between Australia and the United States. The national network infrastructure generally consisted of groups of hosts connected throughout the country exchanging mail and files on a periodic schedule using the SUN3 software and protocols, with several international dial-up links around the country exchanging this information where required. AARNet was initially built as a multi-protocol network, comprising Internet Protocol (IP) as well as DECnet and X.25 so as to accommodate pre-existing ACSnet and SPEARnet systems then in current use. With the rapid subsequent growth in popularity of the Internet, AARNet soon evolved into an IP-only network. In 1988, there were a number of popular network protocols, such as IBM's SNA and the CCITT's X.25, and the ARPANET's IP protocol was only beginning to become favoured. Australian National University staff members Geoff Huston and Peter Elford were seconded by the AVCC in 1989 and tasked with technical management and build of the new network. AARNet introduced its 'value added reseller' program to allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to use its network, the first being Connect.com.au in May 1994. AARNet gradually became a wholesale backbone ISP, serving over 300 smaller ISPs by June 1995. At that point, about 20% of total AARNet traffic was from these other users, and AVCC decided to sell the AARNet commercial assets to Telstra, who currently operates it under the name Telstra Internet. In early 1997, AARNet2 went into service, a network that used ATM links and Internet services under a contract with Cable & Wireless Optus (CWO), now Optus. AARNet became a separate company from the AVCC in 1999. In 2001 AARNet deployed its own international capacity by acquiring 310 Mbit/s of capacity from Sydney via Hawaii to Seattle. As of 2006, the current network is known as AARNet3, and the backbone uses a dark fibre network provided by Nextgen Networks. NREN networks ==Chronology== Major milestones in the development of AARNet include: ===Pre-AARNet ‚Äì Pre-internet=== *1963: CSIRONET established by the CSIRO's Division of Computing Research *1976: CSIRONET had grown to connect more than 50 computers spanning from Townsville to Hobart to Perth via a combination of dial-up and low speed leased line connections *1979: ACSnet formed ‚Äì used MHSnet to transfer files, email and newsgroups between computers in Australian universities and to the USA via low speed dialup connections *1986: South Pacific Education and Research Network (SPEARnet) formed ‚Äì used X.25-based Coloured Book protocols to interconnect 22 Australian and New Zealand universities *1989: Internet brought to Australia via a NASA- subsidized 56 kbit/s dedicated satellite circuit between the University of Melbourne and the University of Hawaii ===The early years ‚Äì building the Internet in Australia=== *1989: AARNet established by the AVCC *1990: AARNet national backbone network built from Brisbane to Perth, each link initially at 48 kbit/s capacity, starring from a hub at the international Internet landing point at the University of Melbourne. AARNet national network was initially built as a multi-protocol layer 3 network, comprising Internet Protocol (IP) as well as DECnet and X.25 so as to accommodate the pre-existing ACSnet and SPEARnet networks. Connections to around 40 universities and CSIRO sites commissioned. *1990‚Äì92: International capacity increased in several rapid increments from 56 kbit/s to 1.5 Mbit/s, at an average 6 month doubling rate.

AARNet was formed into a separate company on 22 December 1998. AARNet Pty Ltd, ACN 084540518, ABN 54 084 540 518, is a not-for-profit company limited by shares. The shareholders are 38 of Australia's universities and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). AARNet Pty Ltd became a licensed telecommunications carrier (Telco) under the Australian Telecommunications Act on 27 November 2000, becoming Australian carrier number 61. ==National network== AARNet national network as at October 2013 The AARNet4 national network comprises high capacity optical fibre transmission paths between switching centres in major cities from Cairns to Perth as well as branch lines to Darwin, Hobart and several other locations. Because optical fibre repair times are long, the backbone network follows two physically diverse paths. As at late 2013, capacity on each leg of the routed network was between 10 and 100 gigabit per second (Gbit/s). Starting with only 48 kbit/s national backbone capacity in 1990, this reflects a similarly rapid exponential growth rate as for AARNet's international capacity. The Network peers with external content providers and ISPs to increase performance and availability of the network. The organisation has a selective peering policy for peering with other providers. This policy applies to all requests for settlement-free interconnection with AARNet, either via dedicated connections or traffic via public internet exchanges. AARNet provides the Internet to several million end-user devices at Australian universities, CSIRO, various other research and educational institutions, and some hospitals. Customer site connections are mostly at 1 to 10 Gbit/s rates, with most end-user Ethernet services at 1 Gbit/s, and Eduroam services at available Wi-Fi performance levels. AARNet's layer 3 services are usually delivered at the AARNet PoP sites. With the introduction of the AARNet3 optical fibre network (i.e. from 2006 onwards) AARNet progressively developed capability to extend services to customer sites in some locations, as well as providing layer 1 and layer 2 inter-campus connections in those areas. Prior to that, and at other locations, it is end-customer institutions' responsibility to extend services to site and to provision their own inter-campus network links. These are either operated directly by AARNet such as in Queensland or provided by companion networks such as SABRENet in South Australia and VERNet in Victoria. Summary of AARNet national IP network performance levels as at 2013: * National backbone links: mostly 10 to 100 Gbit/s * Customer site connections: mostly 1 to 10 Gbit/s * End-user services: mostly 1 Gbit/s Ethernet and available Wi-Fi rates * Continues to sustain traffic growth rates of 50% per annum year on year over the preceding decade ==International connectivity== AARNet's trans-Pacific capacity growth from its inception to 2013 AARNet provides the Australian component of the global advanced Research and Education Internet network. AARNet has high capacity interconnections with North American (Internet2), European (G√âANT) and Asian (TEIN3) components of the global network. As at late 2014, AARNet operated a total capacity of 120 Gbit/s to North America and a further 5 Gbit/s to Asia. This equates to a 2.2 million-fold increase over AARNet's initial trans-Pacific capacity of 56 kbit/s in 1990 and represents an average doubling time of aggregate international capacity of only 14 months over the entire history of AARNet (cf. Moore's Law). ==Application services== In addition to providing high capacity Internet transmission and routing services and a comprehensive range of core Internet services including BGP, DNS, NTP and IPv6, AARNet also provides a variety of higher-layer network services including: * Eduroam global federated authentication service, most often appearing as Eduroam Wi-Fi services on-campus and at associated locations * VoIP IP telephony services * AUCX unified voice and video communications exchangeUnified Communications Exchange, AARNet * Cloud services including CloudStor file storage service * AARNet mirror site to reduce load on international links due to repeated downloads of the same material. To further optimise network traffic loads, AARNet operates high capacity peering links with various major content providers including the Australian ABC, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. ==Supporting big science== CSIRO's ASKAP antennas at the Murchison Radio- astronomy Observatory (MRO), Western Australia, Australia Throughout their life, a major driver for the very high capacities of advanced Research and Education Internet networks including AARNet has been to meet the needs of data-intensive research across a wide range of research disciplines in both the sciences and the humanities. For example, to interconnect major research instruments such as synchrotrons and telescopes in remote locations to high performance computer systems and researchers around the world, such as astronomers in Europe viewing the southern sky using telescopes in Australia or high resolution realtime video links between remote locations. Most recently, AARNet has built a 100 Gbit/s WDM optical fibre transmission system from Perth to Geraldton and on to the Murchison Radio-astronomy Observatory (MRO) in Western Australia in support of Australia's component of the international Square Kilometre Array project and the initial ASKAP telescope array at the MRO. ==References== ==External links== * AARNet * AARNet mirror site Category:Education in Australia Category:Internet in Australia Category:Internet mirror services Category:Internet service providers of Australia Category:National research and education networks Category:Scientific organisations based in Australia Category:Technology companies established in 1998 Category:1998 establishments in Australia ","title":"AARNet"},{"id":"825056","text":"The Seattle Sun was a free, monthly neighborhood newspaper in Seattle, Washington.

This character was named after, but is unrelated to, the real-life Native American man known as The Apache Kid (Haskay-bay-nay-natyl). ==Publication history== The Apache Kid (Alan Krandal) debuted as the cover feature, drawn by a young John Buscema, of Two-Gun Western #5 (cover-dated Nov. 1950). The writer co-creator is unknown. He received his own title the following month, premiering as The Apache Kid #53 (Dec. 1950, picking up the numbering from Reno Browne, Hollywood's Greatest Cowgirl)Apache Kid at AtlasTales.com and then running as Apache Kid #2-19 (Feb. 1951 - Jan. 1952; Dec. 1954 - April 1956). Stories also ran in the omnibus titles Two-Gun Western #5-9 (Nov. 1950 - Aug. 1951) and Wild Western #15-22 (April 1951 - June 1952). After that initial Buscema story and at least two by Joe Maneely (who would also do many of the later covers), the bulk of the book's run would be penciled and inked by future Silver Age X-Men artist Werner Roth.Apache Kid (Marvel character) at the Grand Comics Database After The Apache Kid ended with #19 (April 1956), its numbering continued as the anthology series Western Gunfighters, where the character did not appear. Apache Kid reprints, however, did appear in Marvel's 1970s omnibus series also titled Western Gunfighters. The Kid shared its pages with new Ghost Rider (also known as Phantom Rider) stories, as well as anthological and Western-hero reprints of a changing lineup that included Atlas' Black Rider (here renamed Black Mask), the Western Kid, Wyatt Earp, and later Kid Colt. Apache Kid reprints ran from #2-33, the final issue (Oct. 1970 - Nov. 1975). ==Other versions== The character returned in Apache Skies (2002), a four-issue miniseries starring the Rawhide Kid and two persons called the Apache Kid: Dazii Aloysius Kare, and his wife, Rosa. This was a sequel to the miniseries Blaze of Glory (2000), which specifically retconned that the naively clean-cut Marvel Western stories of years past were merely dime novel fictions of the characters' actual lives. Unrelated characters called the Apache Kid appeared in Fox Comics' Western Outlaws #21 (May 1949), and Youthful Comics' Indian Fighter #5 (Jan. 1952). ==Fictional character biography== Caucasian child Alan Krandal was raised by Apache chief Red Hawk and his wife after being orphaned. When grown, he took on a \\"civilian\\" identity as cowboy Aloysius Kare, changing to his warpaint outfit to fight outlaws both white and Native American, and generally protect both groups of people. Captain Bill Gregory of the nearby fort was his \\"white brother\\" who also respected the elder Red Hawk's counsel. Unlike many other Western comics of the 1950s, Apache Kid generally presented the indigenous Americans in the same light as Caucasians, and made distinctions among the various tribes.The Apache Kid at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

Through a series of splits and mergers, Okada then became a member of the New Frontier Party, Sun Party, and Minseito, finally entering the DPJ upon its merger with Minseito in 1998. He became president of the DPJ on 18 May 2004, and led the DPJ to one of its largest electoral victories in history during the 2004 House of Councillors election.

As foreign minister, Okada was one of the chief participants in negotiations with the United States (US) over the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma on Okinawa. The Foreign Ministry under Okada also confirmed the existence of a long-rumored secret pact between Japan and US which had allowed the US military to carry nuclear weapons into Japanese territory in contravention of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan. The previous administration under the LDP had denied that such a pact existed. In a September 2010 cabinet reshuffle, Okada was moved from foreign minister to secretary general of the DPJ. Okada, who is viewed as an intraparty ally of Prime Minister Naoto Kan, is believed to have been given the role of secretary general in order to secure Kan's influence in the governing party, as well as to help force the passage of government bills in parliament. Okada ran in the DPJ leadership election held in January 2015 after former president Banri Kaieda resigned after losing his seat. Okada won and returned as DPJ leader after a period of nine years. In 2016, he remained as leader when the Democratic Party of Japan merged with the Japan Innovation Party to become the Democratic Party.

He graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1955 with a law degree. He began his career as a bureaucrat in the Ministry of Finance, which gave him authority on finance and tax system issues later in his legislative career. Toward the end of his time at the ministry, he served as an assistant to Chief Cabinet Secretaries Susumu Nikaido and Noboru Takeshita. He was elected to the House of Councilors for the first time in the 1977 election as a member of the Liberal Democratic Party. After serving two terms, he declined to run in 1986 in order to plan a run for the House of Representatives, and won a seat representing Kanagawa Prefecture in the 1990 general election.

He served as Minister of Finance in the cabinets of Morihiro Hosokawa and Tsutomu Hata, and did not substantially change the previous LDP government's financial policy objectives. Fujii was a member of Ichiro Ozawa's Liberal Party during the late 1990s, and served as its secretary-general and headed its financial committee while it was in a coalition government with the LDP. Fujii historically supported Ozawa in opposing any increase in the consumption tax. Fujii lost his seat in the 2005 general election and planned to retire from politics. However, he returned to the Diet in 2007 with retroactive effect after two incumbent representatives resigned. In the run-up to the 2009 general election, he led a campaign to stop Ozawa from becoming the president and prime ministerial candidate of the DPJ. He initially intended to retire from the Diet following the election, and allowed another DPJ candidate to run for his district, but withdrew his resignation at the request of Yukio Hatoyama shortly before candidate lists were finalized. The DPJ won the election in a landslide, and Fujii maintained a seat in the House despite being ranked only 35th on the party's candidate list. === DPJ government (2009-2012) === Fujii was named minister of finance after the election of Hatoyama as Prime Minister in September 2009.Kajimoto, Tetsushi; Fujioka, Chisa (15 September 2009). Japan cabinet takes shape, Fujii for finance: media. Reuters. Shortly following his appointment, Fujii publicly opposed intervention to weaken the Japanese yen for the benefit of Japanese exporters, saying that other countries would be inclined to do the same thing. He later clarified that he did not favor a strong yen and was not pleased with its recent appreciation in value. Fujii also reversed his historical position on the consumption tax, and demanded the appointment of two vice ministers, Yoshihiko Noda and Naoki Minezaki, who were in favor of raising it. Ozawa told Fujii in December 2009 that he failed to demonstrate political leadership, and persuaded Hatoyama to change the party's campaign promise on gasoline taxes over Fujii's objections. Fujii abruptly announced his resignation as finance minister on 5 January 2010, and it was reluctantly accepted by Prime Minister Hatoyama a day later. Fujii had been suffering from high blood pressure and exhaustion, so he claimed that his deteriorating health forced him to resign from the high-stress position of finance minister. However, some political analysts believed that Fujii resigned due to his power struggle with Ozawa. On 7 January 2010, Naoto Kan replaced Fujii as finance minister. Fujii served in the Kan cabinet as Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary. Noda took over the finance portfolio under the Kan government, and succeeded Kan as prime minister in 2011. Fujii remained in regular contact with Noda throughout this time, but was careful to keep a low profile in doing so. He publicly maintained his position on yen intervention, stating in 2011 that it was more important for Japan to open its markets. He announced his retirement from politics at the age of 80, shortly prior to the 2012 general election. == References == == External links == * in Japanese. - Category:1932 births Category:Living people Category:People from Tokyo Category:University of Tokyo alumni Category:Ministers of Finance of Japan Category:Members of the House of Representatives (Japan) Category:Members of the House of Councillors (Japan) Category:Democratic Party of Japan politicians Category:Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) politicians Category:Japan Renewal Party politicians Category:Liberal Party (Japan, 1998) politicians Category:21st-century Japanese politicians ","title":"Hirohisa Fujii"},{"id":"825142","text":"is a Japanese politician from Takasaki, Gunma, who served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from September 2008 to September 2009.

Ward and starring John Goodman, Peter O'Toole, and John Hurt. The film is about an American who becomes the unlikely King of the United Kingdom after an electrical accident wipes out the British royal family. The story is loosely based on the novel Headlong by Emlyn Williams. Very little of the story survived the transition to the screen; characters were changed and the story made into a comedy. The film was a minor box office hit. ==Plot== When the entire British royal family is electrocuted and killed in a freak accident outside Buckingham Palace while having a royal portrait taken, Sir Cedric Willingham leads a search for any surviving heirs to whom to pass the crown. After days of researching, his team finally locates a living heir in the form of an American named Ralph Jones. Shortly after being fired from his job as a lounge singer in Las Vegas, Ralph is informed by Cedric's assistant private secretary Duncan Phipps that his grandmother Constance had an affair with the first Duke of Warren while working as a hotel waitress when the Duke visited the United States, resulting in Ralph having royal blood. Phipps provides further proof by showing Ralph a duplicate of the ring his grandmother used to wear that the Duke had given her. Ralph is flown to London, where Cedric gives him a crash course on royal etiquette. In only his second day as King, he goes to a strip club and meets Miranda Greene, an out-of-luck exotic dancer and aspiring fashion designer, and dares her to go out on a date with him if the British press proves his claim to the monarchy. Meanwhile, Lord Percival Graves is opposed to having an American on the throne and proposes to declare the reigning House of Wyndham at an end and replace it with the House of Stuart, of which he is patriarch. Prime Minister Geoffrey Hale states that Ralph's succession is legitimate unless he commits a grievous error. With this in mind, Graves bribes a cash-strapped Miranda to stir up controversy by having a public relationship with Ralph. Despite warnings by Cedric not to commit a mistake similar to that of King Edward VIII, Ralph sneaks out of the Palace to have a romantic date with Miranda at Hyde Park. The next day, Miranda returns the money to Graves, but he already has photographs of her with Ralph. In order to preserve Ralph's reputation, Miranda breaks up with him. Despite Ralph's reluctance to accept British culture and his ineptness in formal affairs, he makes a positive impression on King Mulambon of Zambezi during the latter's state visit. The two monarchs share their concerns about the role of leadership they have assumed and the economic interests of their nations. Ralph accumulates a small but loyal following. Ralph's staff arrange for him to marry Princess Anna of Finland to continue the royal bloodline and guarantee jobs for the UK in Finland's newly discovered oil reserves in the Baltic Sea. On the night of the Finnish Royal Family's visit, Ralph is turned off by Princess Anna's unusually deep voice, her bizarre sexual preferences, and her nonchalant acceptance of arranged royal marriage. Miranda attends the royal ball as a set-up by Graves, and photos of her affair with Ralph are given to Anna's father King Gustav which, along with Ralph's wild musical number of \\"Good Golly, Miss Molly\\", results in Finland turning down the UK in favor of Japan for the offshore equipment contract. Having failed to realize that the role of King comes with certain expectations, and that he cannot rely on his charm or blue-collar background, Ralph accepts a stern rebuke from Cedric and endeavors to set things right. Miranda confesses to Ralph her role in the scandal and he walks out on her. Ralph develops suspicions about his circumstances and learns through Phipps that Cedric is another heir to the throne. His mother who was a parlor maid had a one night stand with the king and Cedric turned down the role. Ralph addresses Parliament, apologizing for his recent actions and informing the country that he has worked out a deal with King Mulambon for Zambezi to purchase ¬£200 million worth of British mining equipment and open three car engine plants in Britain, ensuring jobs for Miranda's family and thousands of Britons. He then reveals that Graves has been sabotaging his succession to the throne and has him arrested for violating the Treason Act of 1702 that was enacted by William III. Finally, he announces that he will abdicate and reveals Cedric as his successor. After Cedric accepts his duty as King, Ralph is appointed as the Third Duke of Warren, with a lucrative annual salary and his own recording studio in his own country estate. He marries Miranda and raises his son Ralph II with her while fronting his own singing group Ralph and the Dukettes. They perform a cover of \\"Duke of Earl\\" as the credits roll. ==Cast== ==ProductionFilming=== King Ralph was shot in various locations in England. Stand-ins for Buckingham Palace include Wrotham Park, Syon House, Somerset House, Harewood House, Old Royal Naval College, Apsley House, Belvoir Castle, Hagley Hall, Lancaster House, and Blenheim Palace. Warwick Castle and Hever Castle were used to substitute the interior shots for Windsor Castle. St Pancras railway station was used to film the scene introducing the Finnish Royal Family. Highclere Castle was used for Lord Graves' home. Dalton, South Yorkshire, was the location of Miranda's parents' home. ===Marketing=== Universal Pictures launched a marketing campaign for the film, including a partnership with Burger King valued at US$8 million. ==Soundtrack== The film's score was composed by James Newton Howard, while the soundtrack features songs performed by John Goodman: #\\"Tiny Bubbles\\" #\\"Good Golly, Miss Molly\\" #\\"Duke of Earl\\" Other songs featured in the film include: #\\"Good Golly, Miss Molly\\" by Jeff Lynne #\\"Be-Bop-A-Lula\\" by Gene Vincent and His Blue Chaps #\\"Moulin Rouge\\" #\\"I'm in the Mood for Love\\" ==ReceptionBox office=== In the US the film earned $8.3 million in its opening weekend, in third place. ===Critical response=== Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 27% based on reviews from 11 critics, with an average rating of 4.8/10. Owen Glieberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C grade, complaining about the entirely predictable jokes, but praising Goodman for his likable performance. Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert of At the Movies gave the film \\"Two Thumbs Down\\", with Ebert commenting that \\"it might have been funnier if John Goodman had played a sleazeball instead of a cuddly nice guy.\\" William Thomas of Empire magazine gave the film two out of five stars, calling it \\"Poor, even for a 'funny because he's fat' film.\\" ==References* * * Category:1991 films Category:1991 comedy films Category:American comedy films Category:American films Category:English-language films Ralph Category:Films about royalty Category:Films scored by James Newton Howard Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films set in England Category:Films set in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Films set in London Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios Category:Films shot in England Category:Films shot in Hampshire Category:Films shot in Hertfordshire Category:Films shot in Oxfordshire Category:Films shot in South Yorkshire Category:Films shot in Warwickshire Category:Films shot in Worcestershire Category:Monarchy in fiction Category:Universal Pictures films ","title":"King Ralph"},{"id":"825155","text":"LTA4 Note the four double bonds, three of them conjugated. This is a common property of A4, B4, C4, D4, and E4. LTB4 LTC4 is a cysteinyl leukotriene, as are D4 and E4. LTD4 LTE4 Leukotrienes are a family of eicosanoid inflammatory mediators produced in leukocytes by the oxidation of arachidonic acid (AA) and the essential fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) by the enzyme arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase. Leukotrienes use lipid signaling to convey information to either the cell producing them (autocrine signaling) or neighboring cells (paracrine signaling) in order to regulate immune responses. The production of leukotrienes is usually accompanied by the production of histamine and prostaglandins, which also act as inflammatory mediators. One of their roles (specifically, leukotriene D4) is to trigger contractions in the smooth muscles lining the bronchioles; their overproduction is a major cause of inflammation in asthma and allergic rhinitis. Leukotriene antagonists are used to treat these disorders by inhibiting the production or activity of leukotrienes. == History and name == The name leukotriene, introduced by Swedish biochemist Bengt Samuelsson in 1979, comes from the words leukocyte and triene (indicating the compound's three conjugated double bonds). What would be later named leukotriene C, \\"slow reaction smooth muscle-stimulating substance\\" (SRS) was originally described between 1938 and 1940 by Feldberg and Kellaway. The researchers isolated SRS from lung tissue after a prolonged period following exposure to snake venom and histamine. Leukotrienes are commercially available to the research community. ==TypesCysteinyl leukotrienes=== LTC4, LTD4, LTE4 and LTF4 are often called cysteinyl leukotrienes due to the presence of the amino acid cysteine in their structure. The cysteinyl leukotrienes make up the slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A). LTF4, like LTD4, is a metabolite of LTC4, but, unlike LTD4, which lacks the glutamic residue of glutathione, LTF4 lacks the glycine residue of glutathione.internet checked April 24, 2012 ===LTB4=== LTB4 is synthesized in vivo from LTA4 by the enzyme LTA4 hydrolase. Its primary function is to recruit neutrophils to areas of tissue damage, though it also helps promote the production of inflammatory cytokines by various immune cells. Drugs that block the actions of LTB4 have shown some efficacy in slowing the progression of neutrophil-mediated diseases. ===LTG4=== There has also been postulated the existence of LTG4, a metabolite of LTE4 in which the cysteinyl moiety has been oxidized to an alpha-keto-acid (i.e.‚Äîthe cysteine has been replaced by a pyruvate). Very little is known about this putative leukotriene. ===LTB5=== Leukotrienes originating from the omega-3 class eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) have diminished inflammatory effects. LTB5 induces aggregation of rat neutrophils, chemokinesis of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), lysosomal enzyme release from human PMN and potentiation of bradykinin-induced plasma exudation, although compared to LTB4, it has at least 30 times less potency. == Biochemistry  Synthesis === Eicosanoid synthesis. (Leukotrienes at right.) Leukotrienes are synthesized in the cell from arachidonic acid by arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase. The catalytic mechanism involves the insertion of an oxygen moiety at a specific position in the arachidonic acid backbone. The lipoxygenase pathway is active in leukocytes and other immunocompetent cells, including mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes, and basophils. When such cells are activated, arachidonic acid is liberated from cell membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2, and donated by the 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) to 5-lipoxygenase. 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO) uses FLAP to convert arachidonic acid into 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), which spontaneously reduces to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE). The enzyme 5-LO acts again on 5-HETE to convert it into leukotriene A4 (LTA4), an unstable epoxide. 5-HETE can be further metabolized to 5-oxo-ETE and 5-oxo-15-hydroxy-ETE, all of which have pro-inflammatory actions similar but not identical to those of LTB4 and mediated not by LTB4 receptors but rather by the OXE receptor (see 5-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid). In cells equipped with LTA hydrolase, such as neutrophils and monocytes, LTA4 is converted to the dihydroxy acid leukotriene LTB4, which is a powerful chemoattractant for neutrophils acting at BLT1 and BLT2 receptors on the plasma membrane of these cells. In cells that express LTC4 synthase, such as mast cells and eosinophils, LTA4 is conjugated with the tripeptide glutathione to form the first of the cysteinyl-leukotrienes, LTC4. Outside the cell, LTC4 can be converted by ubiquitous enzymes to form successively LTD4 and LTE4, which retain biological activity. The cysteinyl-leukotrienes act at their cell-surface receptors CysLT1 and CysLT2 on target cells to contract bronchial and vascular smooth muscle, to increase permeability of small blood vessels, to enhance secretion of mucus in the airway and gut, and to recruit leukocytes to sites of inflammation. Both LTB4 and the cysteinyl-leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4) are partly degraded in local tissues, and ultimately become inactive metabolites in the liver. === Function === Leukotrienes act principally on a subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. They may also act upon peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. Leukotrienes are involved in asthmatic and allergic reactions and act to sustain inflammatory reactions. Several leukotriene receptor antagonists such as montelukast and zafirlukast are used to treat asthma. Recent research points to a role of 5-lipoxygenase in cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric illnesses. Leukotrienes are very important agents in the inflammatory response. Some such as LTB4 have a chemotactic effect on migrating neutrophils, and as such help to bring the necessary cells to the tissue. Leukotrienes also have a powerful effect in bronchoconstriction and increase vascular permeability. ==Leukotrienes in asthma== Leukotrienes contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma, especially in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), and cause or potentiate the following symptoms: *airflow obstruction *increased secretion of mucus *mucosal accumulation *bronchoconstriction *infiltration of inflammatory cells in the airway wall ===Role of cysteinyl leukotrienes=== Cysteinyl leukotriene receptors CYSLTR1 and CYSLTR2 are present on mast cells, eosinophil, and endothelial cells. During cysteinyl leukotriene interaction, they can stimulate proinflammatory activities such as endothelial cell adherence and chemokine production by mast cells. As well as mediating inflammation, they induce asthma and other inflammatory disorders, thereby reducing the airflow to the alveoli. The levels of cysteinyl leukotrienes, along with 8-isoprostane, have been reported to be increased in the EBC of patients with asthma, correlating with disease severity. Cysteinyl leukotrienes may also play a role in adverse drug reactions in general and in contrast medium induced adverse reactions in particular. In excess, the cysteinyl leukotrienes can induce anaphylactic shock. ==Leukotrienes in dementia== Leukotrienes are found to play an important role in the later stages of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in studies with animals. In tau transgenic mice, which develop tau pathology, \\"zileuton, a drug that inhibits leukotriene formation by blocking the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme\\" was found to reverse memory loss. == See also == * A chemical synthesis of Leukotriene A methyl ester * Eoxins (14,15-leukotrienes) ==References== ==Further reading== * Bailey, J.

Dog crossbreeds, sometimes called designer dogs, are dogs which have been intentionally bred from two or more recognized dog breeds. They are not dogs with no purebred ancestors, but are not otherwise recognised as breeds in their own right, and do not necessarily breed true. == Early dog crossbreeds == Several types of dog crossbreeds date from the 14th century or earlier, such as the lurcher or the longdog. Historically, crosses between dogs of different types were more well accepted at a time when modern purebred breeds (based on the eugenics principles) did not yet exist. These types of crosses were performed to aggregate qualities of two different types in the same dog or to perfect an already fixed type of dog, always for working purposes. An example to be cited is the famous case of Lord Orford's Greyhounds, which were improved by adding courage through the crossing with Old English Bulldogs, achieving the desired result after six generations. With the success of Lord Orford's dogs, the practice was adopted by other Greyhound breeders and became more common. File:181. Greyhound x Bulldog first cross.JPGGreyhound/Old English Bulldog first cross File:182. Greyhound x Bulldog second cross.JPGGreyhound/Old English Bulldog second cross File:183. Greyhound x Bulldog third cross.JPGGreyhound/Old English Bulldog third cross File:182. Greyhound x Bulldog fourth cross.jpgGreyhound/Old English Bulldog fourth cross Other historical examples are the bull and terrier (Old English Bulldog and terrier cross) and crosses between foxhounds and Old Spanish Pointersthat later resulted in the English Pointer. ==Designer dogs== The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica traces what was the \\"designer dog\\" fad to the late 20th century, when breeders began to cross purebred Poodles with other purebred breeds in order to obtain a dog with the Poodle's hypoallergenic coat, along with various desirable characteristics from other breeds.A Bassador (Basset Hound-Labrador Retriever cross) The primary identifying mark of a designer dog is that the resulting puppies are called by a portmanteau word made up of syllables (or sounds) from the breed names of the two purebred parents, such as Schnoodle (Schnauzer and Poodle cross). or Shepsky (German Shepherd Dog/Siberian Husky cross). Other purebred breeds are being crossed to provide designer dogs described with an endless range of created labels, such as the Puggle (Pug and Beagle cross). There are even complex crosses (with multiple breeds in recent ancestry) being labeled in this manner, such as German Chusky (German Shepherd Dog, Siberian Husky and Chow Chow cross). Like children in a family, a percentage of designer dogs with the same breed ancestry will look similar to each other, even though crossbreeding does not result in as uniform a phenotype as the breeding of purebreds. Often even pups in the same litter will look quite different.A Huskamute (Siberian Husky-Alaskan Malamute cross) puppy Another defining characteristic of designer dogs is that they are usually bred as companion dogs and pets. Working and hunting dogs deliberately crossbred for a particular working purpose are not generally given portmanteau names; they are most often referred to by a type name, such as Eurohounds (racing sled dogs) or lurchers (hunting dogs). These dogs could be considered only as crossbreeds, not as designer animals, since appearance is not the main reason for them to be bred. An exception to this is the Labradoodle, which although having a portmanteau name, is often used as a Guide or Assistance dog as well as being a popular family dog. Although designer dogs are often selected by owners for their novelty, reputable breeders sometimes use crossbreeding in an attempt to reduce the incidence of certain hereditary problems found in the purebred dogs, while retaining their more appealing traits. Jon Mooallem in The New York Times writes, \\"Given the roughly 350 inherited disorders littering the dog genome, crossing two purebreds and expanding their gene pools can be 'a phenomenally good idea,' according to one canine geneticist‚Äîif it is done conscientiously.\\" Crossbreeding has not been well studied in dogs, although it has been for livestock. The heritability of the desired trait being bred for (such as a hypoallergenic coat) needs to be known; \\"Heritability is the proportion of the measurable difference observed between animals for a given trait that is due to genetics (and can be passed to the next generation).\\" In addition, the goals of dog crossbreeding may be harder to define than the goals of livestock crossbreeding; good temperament may be harder to define and measure than high calf weight. A Welsh Corgi and Jack Russell Terrier crossbreed puppy Designer dog breeders are often criticised for being more interested in profitable puppy production than in dog health and welfare. Wally Conron comments on the popularity of crosses after his introduction of the Labradoodle: \\"Were breeders bothering to check their sires and bitches for heredity faults, or were they simply caught up in delivering to hungry customers the next status symbol?\\" Designer dog puppies sometimes bring higher prices than the purebreds from which they are bred. The fanciers of designer dogs respond that all modern dog breeds were created from earlier breeds and types of dogs through the same kind of selective breeding that is used to create designer dogs. The Toy Poodle was bred down in size from the larger Standard Poodle, most likely by crossing with various very small Bichon types, such as the Maltese and Havanese. Most of the modern breeds have ancestries that include various older dog types and breeds; see individual breed articles for details of the origin of each breed. Health of crossbred dogs depends on their being descended from healthy parents. Breeders who select their breeding stock for cost-effectiveness and who skip health testing for the same reason will not produce puppies that are as reliably healthy as those bred by more conscientious breeders. However, studies of longevity in dogs have found some advantage for crossbreeds compared to purebred dogs. In general it is believed that crossbred dogs \\"have a far lower chance of exhibiting the disorders that are common with the parental breeds. Their genetic health will be substantially higher.\\" Many breeders of designer dogs take advantage of the fact that people are impressed by a pet that they believe offers them an elevated social status, such as other \\"designer\\" goods do. \\"It's human nature to aspire to own something a little different, a little fancy or in short supply.\\" ==Genetic defects== Crossbreeding to take advantage of the increased chance that a recessive detrimental allele will only be inherited from one parent, and therefore not expressed in the phenotype of the offspring, is only one strategy breeders can use to decrease the incidences of genetic defects. Knowing the disease incidence in the breed, and the genetic history of the individual, is ultimately important in dog breeding. ==Registration and recognition== Crossbreed dogs are not recognized by traditional breed registries, even if both parents are registered purebreds. Breed associations such as the American Kennel Club, the United Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel Club do not recognize designer crosses as dog breeds.A Westiepoo (West Highland White Terrier-Poodle cross) adult If crossbred dogs are bred together for some period of time, and their breeding is well documented, they may eventually be considered a new breed of dog by major kennel clubs (an example of a recent crossbreed becoming a breed recognised by all major kennel clubs is the Cesky Terrier). New breeds of dogs must have a breed club that will document the ancestry of any individual member of that breed from the original founding dogs of the breed; when the kennel club that the breed club wishes to join is satisfied that the dogs are pedigreed, they will accept and register the dogs of that breed. Each kennel club has individual rules about how to document a new breed. Some minor registries and internet registry businesses will register dogs as any breed the owner chooses with minimal or no documentation; some even allow the breeder or owner to make up a designer \\"breed name\\" for their pet. Some crossbred dogs, created by breeding two purebred dogs of different breeds, may have the advantage of heterosis, or crossbreed vigor. This advantage can be progressively diluted when two crossbreeds are bred in the attempt to create a breed, narrowing the gene pool. The best way to continue taking advantage of crossbreed vigor is from the breeding of dogs of purebred ancestry, as this vigor is typically seen only in the first generation cross of two purebred animals of separate breeds, thus taking advantage of genetic diversity. ==Portmanteau names== With the long-time popularity of the label Cockapoo, used since at least 1960 and constructed by combining elements of its two contributing breeds (Cocker Spaniel/Miniature Poodle), it has become extremely common to find crossbred dogs given labels likewise invented by portmanteau. The tendency for using such labels in a jocular way dates back at least to Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom's Dorgis (Dachshund/Pembroke Welsh Corgi). None of these have become recognised by any major registry as purebred breeds. However, as of 2006, the portmanteau words Cockapoo and Labradoodle are found in some dictionaries. Fanciful label names such as these are often found in for-sale ads, or on the websites that allow sellers to make up their own names for litters of crossbred puppies. The terms are only loosely descriptive and are seldom consistent. ==See also== * Coydog * Coywolf * Crossbreed, for any animal * Dog hybrid (with other Canis species: wolf, coyote, jackal, etc.) * Dingo‚Äìdog hybrid * Dog type * Jackal‚Äìdog hybrid * Puppy mill * Purebred dog * Wolfdog ==References== ==External links== * *Much Ado About Poo at canismajor.com * D Category:Dog breeding ","title":"Dog crossbreed"},{"id":"825165","text":"The Bakhtiari () are a southwestern Iranian tribe,Curzon, Persia and the Persian Question, London, 1892, II, pp. 273-303. and a subgroup of the Lurs.

Spencer Wells et al., \\"The Eurasian Heartland: A continental perspective on Y-chromosome diversity,\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (August 28, 2001 The Southwest Eurasian haplogroups F, G, and T1a also reach substantial frequency among Bakhtiaris. ==Etymology== The term bakhtiari can be best translated as \\"companion of fortune\\" or \\"bearer of good luck\\" The term has deep Persian roots and is the result of two smaller words bakht and yar complied together . Bakht is the Persian word for \\"fortune\\" and yar, iar, iari literally means \\"companion\\". The latter designation largely relates to the nature of the tribe's annual \\"migration\\". This has to do with the harsh nature of Bakhtiari life and overcoming of countless difficulties that Bakhtiaris have faced in the Zagros ranges. In this sense, Bakhtiaris view themselves as a hardworking tribe, facing numerous obstacles everyday and yet fortunate enough to overcome each of these challenges as a solid unit. Nevertheless, the origins of Bakhtiaris are ancient and it may have very well been the case that the tribe underwent a series of name changes throughout its history. However it is mostly claimed that the designation \\"Bakhtiari\\" came largely into use some time in antiquity.Garthwaite., Gene R. Khans and Shahs : a Documentary Analysis of the Bakhtiyari in Iran. New York: Cambridge UP, 1933. Print. ==History== Constitutional Revolution: In Iran's contemporary history, the Bakhtiari have played a significant role; particularly during the advent of the country's Constitutional Revolution (1905‚Äì1907). This event was largely secured through the Bakhtari campaign, which eventually deposed Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar (r. 1907‚Äì1909). The Bakhtiari tribesmen, under the leadership of the Haft Lang khans Sardar Assad and his brother Najaf Qoli Khan Bakhtiari- Saad ad-Daula (also referred to as Samsam-os Saltane), captured Tehran and, as a result, saved the revolution.Douglas, William O. \\"The Bakhtiari Save the Constitution.\\" Strange Lands and Friendly People. Hicks, 2007. 114-20. Print. These events eventually led to the abdication of Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar (r. 1907‚Äì1909) in 1909 and his exile to Russia. This incident secured Saad ad- Daula the position of Prime Minister in the period that followed the abdication of the Qajar Shah. Nonetheless, with Russian backing, the Shah would soon return in 1911 by landing with a coalition of forces at Astarabad . p. 285-286 However, his efforts to reclaim his throne would bear no fruit. In this sense, the Bakhtiaris played a critical role in saving the revolution from the Qajar forces. Pahlavi Period: With the expansion of Bakhtiari influence, urban elites (particularly in Tehran) began to worry in regards to a potential Bakhtiari takeover of Persia's affairs. Prior to this point, the Bakhtiari had largely remained within their own territorial boundaries. The Bakhtiari influence would continue to play an important role within the early 20th century politics of Iran. Reza Shah Pahlavi (r. 1925‚Äì1941) made the destruction of the Bakhtiari influence his mission. The existence of oil on Bakhtiari territory further motivated the Pahlavi monarch to undermine the autonomy of the tribe and force its population to adhere to the commands of the central government. Reza Shah Pahlavi would eventually execute a few noteworthy tribal leaders to crush Bakhtiari autonomy and maintain control over the tribe. Amongst the executed Khans was Mohammad Reza Khan (Sardar-e- Fateh), the father of what later became the Pahlavi Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar. The latter event was a turning point for Bakhtiari and their rise within Iranian politics. ==Tribal structure== A Bakhtiari nomad family The Bakhtiari people are mainly from two tribal divisions, Chahar Lang (English: Four Shares) and Haft Lang (English: Seven Shares). Lang word in bakhtiari dialect means \\"share of tax or inheritance\\". Due to the harsh nature of their life style, Bakhtiaris have been able to keep their blood lines intact, largely marrying within their own tribe. Bakhtiaris trace a common lineage, being divided into the Chahar Lang (The Four Shares) and Haft Lang (The Seven Shares) groups, each controlled by a single powerful family. The overall khan alternates every two years between the chiefs of the Chahar Lang and the Haft Lang. The famous documentary Grass: A Nation's Battle for Life (1925) tells the story of the migration of Bakhtiari tribe from winter quarters in Khuzestan to summer quarters Chahar Mahaal. This film also tells the story of how these people crossed the river Karun with 50,000 people and 500,000 animals. The documentary \\"People of the Wind\\" (1975) retraces this same journey, 50 years later. The British documentary series \\"The Ascent of Man\\" (1973) in the first part of its second episode, \\"The Harvest of the Seasons,\\" also shows the Bakhtiari making the annual migration to the summer pastures. This portrayal is not however, particularly positive, using the Bakhtiari as an example of a pre-agricultural tribe frozen in time. As of 2006, the migration still takes place, although the livestock are now transported in trucks, and the shepherds no longer walk barefoot in the snow between provinces. ==Music== The Bakhtiari are noted in Iran for their remarkable music which inspired Alexander Borodin.Ullens de Schooten, Marie-T√®r√©se. (1956). Lords of the Mountains: Southern Persia & the Kashkai Tribe, pp. 113-114. Chatto and Windus Ltd. Reprint: The Travel Book Club. London. The Bakhtiari dialect is the most popular dialect of the Luri language. == Culture  Livelihood and Dwellings === Bakhtiari nomads migrate twice a year with their herds for pasture: in spring to the mountains in their summer quarters (sardsƒ´r or yaylƒÅq) and in autumn to valleys and the plains in their winter quarters (garmsƒ´r or qishlƒÅq). The livestock the Bakhtiari mainly raise are goats, sheep, horses, and cattle. However, some Bakhtiari also engage in agricultural occupations and mostly cultivate wheat and other cereal grains. Nomadic Baktiari rely on trading and bartering with nearby villages and populations to obtain products they don't have or are unable to create themselves (like agricultural goods). Temporary dwellings for the Bakhtiari include rectangular tents or brush or wood shelters. These types of dwellings are used when moving their herds around. Recently, some Bakhtiari have urbanized and began to settle in large villages and even in cities. === Language, Gender, and Religion === A Bakhti√¢ri dialect speaker, recorded for Wikitongues. The Bakhtiari speak the Lori language (Bakhtiari dialect). Many men can also speak Persian. Shia Islam is the main religion followed by both the nomadic and sedentary Bakhtiaris. The Bakhtiaris are devout and practice the faith piously. Despite the patriarchal nature of Bakhtiari society, women enjoy a rather high degree of freedom. This was because of their importance in the Bakhtiari economy as weavers in which colorful and stylish designs on carpets made them very popular among buyers. However, after the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the Bakhtiari (along with Iranian society in general) underwent rapid changes so presently, Bakhtiari women don't have the same kind of privileges they had before the revolution. ==Famous Bakhtiaris== *Bahman Ala'eddin (Masood Bakhtiari), the most famous singer in the Bakhtiari dialect. *Davar Ardalan, NPR producer and author, whose mother Mary Laleh Bakhtiar is a Bakhtiari. *Sardar Assad, Bakhtiari Haft Lang Chieftain and Constitutionalist. *Laleh Bakhtiar, authorLaleh Bakhtiar, \\"Muhammad\\", Diane Publishing (1994), 39 pages. . and former professor at the University of Chicago, who wrote a feminist re-interpretation of the Koran. *Rostam Amir Bakhtiar, Chief of Imperial Protocol (1953‚Äì1979). *Abbasgholi Bakhtiar, Minister of Industries & Mines (1979). *Abdolhamid Bakhtiar, Majles Deputy. *Agha Khan Bakhtiar, Minister of Labor (1957‚Äì1958), Head of the National Iranian Oil Company. *Gholam-Reza Bakhtiar, Sardar Bakhtiar, Deputy Governor of Esfahan. *Rudi Bakhtiar, former CNN and FOX TV news anchor and journalist. *Shahpour Bakhtiar, politician and Prime Minister of Iran (1979). *Teymur Bakhtiar, Iranian general and head of Savak. *Behnoosh Bakhtiari, Iranian actress. *David Bakhtiari, NFL player and offensive tackle for the Green Bay Packers. *Gholam-Hossein Bakhtiari (Sardar Mohtashem), Minister of War (1911‚Äì13, 1918). *Pezhman Bakhtiari, poet (1900‚Äì1974). *Shaghayegh Dehghan, Iranian television actress, half Bakhtiari. *, Iranian Ambassador to West Germany (1950s). *Soraya Esfandiary-Bakhtiari, Empress of Iran (1951‚Äì58). *Mirza Hideyatu'llah Ashtiani Bakhtiari (d.1892), Iran's finance minister during the Qajar period. *Yahya Bakhtiar, Attorney General and author of Pakistan's 1973 Constitution. *Eman Mobali, football player. *Fereydoon Moshiri, contemporary Persian poet. *Zargham Saltaneh, Ebrahim, commander and instrumental figure in the Constitutional Revolution of 1909. *Nasir Khan, Sardar Jang, Governor of Yazd. *Niloufar Bakhtiar Bakhtiari, founder of NBB Design London, Interior Architecture. *Mohsen Rezaei, former commander-in-chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. *Bijan Allipour, CEO of NISOC. *Bahram Akasheh, Iran's leading experts on earthquakes ==Books== * * Ali Quli Khan Sardar Assad and A.

It is the sequel to Star Fox (1993) and, like its predecessor, pushed the graphical capabilities of the SNES with Argonaut's Super FX technology. Star Fox 2 continues the battle against Emperor Andross, who seeks to conquer the Lylat system. It introduces semi-real-time gameplay, new ship types, new Star Fox team members, and a more advanced 3D game engine. It is the seventh game in the series but the second made. Star Fox 2 was completed and planned for release in 1995, but was canceled over fears that it would appear graphically inferior compared to new 32-bit consoles from competitors. Various prototype ROM images leaked online in the ensuing years. In 2017, the game was released as an unlockable game on the Super NES Classic Edition. In 2019, it became available on the Nintendo Switch Online service for the Nintendo Switch. ==Gameplay== A screenshot showing the main gameplay area, a map representing the Lylat system. Instead of following mostly linear paths inside predefined missions as in Star Fox, the player moves a team of two ships freely around a map screen that represents the Lylat system. When the player's ships make contact with enemy forces, the game switches to an action perspective, piloting the Arwing ship directly with controls and gameplay similar to the first Star Fox. When the player clears the specified objectives, they are taken back to the map screen to select a new destination. The objective is to beat all enemy forces present in the map while defending planet Corneria, preventing its damage level from reaching 100%. The player must intercept fighters and incoming IPBMs (interplanetary ballistic missiles), while also dealing with battleships, which deploy more fighter squadrons, and planetary bases, which fire IPBMs. If Corneria's damage level reaches 100% or the player runs out of extra ships, the game ends. General Pepper employs a satellite that can shoot down enemies on a limited basis; the player must also defend this installation from special enemies that can take over the satellite, and use its cannon to fire at Corneria. The player also encounters the Star Wolf mercenary team and various bosses. Star Fox 2 employs a semi-real-time strategy system. While selecting a destination on the map screen, the game is paused, but while the player's ships travel to their destinations, enemies and missiles also move toward theirs. While fighting enemies in the action screen, time moves at a slower pace than on the map screen, allowing other enemies and missiles to advance and cause damage. To prevent excessive damage to Corneria, the player may need to leave a battle to intercept another enemy. ==Synopsis== After his defeat in the original Star Fox, the antagonist, Andross, returns to the Lylat system and launches an attack against Corneria, using his new fleet of battleships and giant missiles launched from hidden bases to destroy the planet. General Pepper again calls upon the Star Fox team for help. Armed with new custom Arwings, a Mothership, and two new recruits (Miyu, a lynx, and Fay, a dog), the Star Fox team sets out to defend Corneria by destroying Andross's forces before they can inflict critical damage on the planet. Along the way, Star Fox must also combat giant bosses, bases on planets throughout the Lylat system, members of the Star Wolf team and finally Andross himself. Star Fox 2 features six playable characters, more than any game in the series until Star Fox Command (2006). Primary characters include Fox McCloud, a fox who wears a green suit and leads the Star Fox team; Falco Lombardi, the cocky expert pilot with a green suit and a sometimes contentious relationship with Fox; Peppy Hare, a rabbit in a red suit and a mentor to Fox and the wisest member of the team; Slippy Toad, a frog in a blue suit and the team technician and childhood friend of Fox; Fay, a white dog with a blue suit like Slippy and a pink hair bow who is a new member of the team; and Miyu, a tomboyish lynx who is also a new addition to the team. ==Development== Director Katsuya Eguchi Like its predecessor Star Fox (1993), Star Fox 2 was co-developed by Nintendo EAD in Japan and UK-based Argonaut Software. Development began shortly after work was finished on the European and competition versions of Star Fox. Argonaut had a contract with Nintendo to create three games. For their final two games, Argonaut programmers Giles Goddard and Dylan Cuthbert decided to split with Goddard working on Stunt Race FX (1994) and Cuthbert on Star Fox 2. Cuthbert worked out of Nintendo's headquarters in Kyoto and had little contact with Argonaut during development. He served as lead programmer and was assigned two Japanese Nintendo programmers to work under him. The team was overlooked by designers Shigeru Miyamoto and Katsuya Eguchi, with Eguchi serving as director. Edge reported publicly in December 1993 that development on a sequel to Star Fox had begun. The team decided early on to use the Super FX 2 chip in the game cartridge. It was an enhanced version of the Super FX, a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) for SNES ROM cartridges developed by Argonaut. The original chip was designed to calculate 3D math quickly and was first used in Star Fox. The Super FX 2 had more memory and ran at 21 MHz, twice as fast as the original chip. Argonaut's original proposal for the Super FX used this improved architecture, but Nintendo found it too expensive at the time. Cuthbert also rewrote parts of the engine to run in parallel in RAM to free more Super FX 2 processing for more advanced features like planar clipping and advanced collision detection. All these enhancements gave the new chip greater capabilities to manipulate more polygons, more sprites, and texture map quicker; giving the team the computing power needed for free-roaming 3D environments. Such free-roaming gameplay was planned for the original Star Fox, but it was limited to on rails because of the original Super FX chip's limited computing powers. Cuthbert also retooled the engine to increase the framerate from 20 to 30 FPS, but it was not steady so they locked the framerate at 20 FPS. Freely explorable environments were the only gameplay element planned for the original Star Fox carried into Star Fox 2, all other ideas were new. The Super FX 2 chip developed by Argonaut Software, seen here in Yoshi's Island Miyamoto considered the Star Fox series a platform for experimenting new gameplay ideas. The team experimented more with Star Fox 2 than Star Fox. This creativity led to gameplay ideas such as the platforming sequences with the robot walker. Miyamoto took great interest in Cuthbert's platforming gameplay (before Super Mario 64's release in 1996). At one point in development, the walker sequences occurred in much larger space stations with energy gates that needed to be unlocked, a gameplay structure comparable to dungeon crawling. Because of the Super FX 2's greater computing power, the team decided to have the fighters visibly transform into the walkers. The transformation was made in a realistic sense; the artists even drafted the mechanisms by which the fighters transformed. Director Eguchi wanted to explore a more roguelike game system and use similar game mechanics to Star Luster (1985). He played Star Luster repeatedly for inspiration and was particularly fond of its random encounters system. He also enjoyed Fortune Street and was inspired by its more strategic gameplay elements. Given this direction, the team designed the main gameplay structure: players would move across a map defending planets from the enemy, battling in randomly generated enemy encounters. It was designed to play out differently each gameplay session. For further replayability, the team added six playable characters, two of which were series newcomers: Miyu and Fay. More antagonists were added as well including Wolf. A two-player mode was planned and tested, but the team could not get the frame rate high and steady enough for it to be enjoyable. === Promotion at Winter CES === Star Fox 2 was playable on the show floor at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show (Winter CES) in Las Vegas in January 1995. The version demonstrated was significantly different from the final version completed later. GamePro enjoyed the free-roaming gameplay, the craft morphing ability, and strategy elements. Electronic Gaming Monthly also liked the shift to free-roaming and felt the non-linear gameplay and ship morphing abilities were two major improvements. Nintendo Power dubbed it their top SNES game of the show. All three magazines thought Star Fox 2 was better than the original. Edge was more critical, writing that Star Fox 2 was Nintendo's attempt to keep the SNES relevant. They wrote that the Super FX polygons were not particularly impressive, and the gameplay lacked \\"the immediate appeal of its predecessor.\\" A man was arrested and charged with felony grand larceny for attempting to steal a demo cart from the show floor. ===Cancellation=== By mid-1995, Star Fox 2 was nearing completion, and was planned for release in August. However, 3D technology was advancing quickly and the 3D game market was expanding, with competition from the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn. The consoles ran impressive 3D graphics that captured the public's attention. Nintendo was concerned that the 16-bit Star Fox 2 3D visuals would be compared to the superior 3D capabilities of competing consoles. Cuthbert said that Star Fox 2 would be \\"compared directly against games such as Ridge Racer, which felt like you finally had an arcade machine's power in your home.\\" Nintendo decided to prioritize on its upcoming Nintendo 64 console, including a new Star Fox game, Star Fox 64. According to Cuthbert, Miyamoto wanted a clear break between 3D games on the SNES and the N64. The Super FX 2 chip also raised the cost of production, which would have made Star Fox 2 an expensive release. Star Fox 2 was canceled when it was about 95% complete. Nintendo still wanted the game finished after cancellation, so took it through full localization and QA testing. Cuthbert said there may not have been an official announcement of cancellation, and there was confusion about the game's status in the media. The August 1995 issue of GamePro printed that it had been delayed to 1996, while Electronic Gaming Monthly wrote that had been canceled in their September 1995 issue. Nintendo Power wrote in their September 1995 issue that \\"rumors of the demise of Star Fox 2 have been greatly exaggerated\\", with a release most likely coming in the first half of 1996. ==Prototype leaks== A screenshot from a prototype build In the years following cancellation, ROM images of incomplete builds of Star Fox 2 were leaked onto the internet. The leakers of the ROMs are anonymous. Cuthbert claims it was not him, though he recalls not cleaning his hard drive when he left Argonaut immediately following completion of Star Fox 2 and suspects the leakers pulled the ROMs from there or Argonaut's archives. The first ROMs leaked in the late 1990s and were early test builds with numerous software bugs. These versions mostly consist of debug menus and sparsely populated landscapes; one version includes a 2-player mode. A few years later, Cuthbert was contacted by an anonymous person that had a non-working copy of the final beta ROM. Cuthbert assisted in determining that an internal header was missing, and was able to add the header to get it functioning. The ROM image was leaked online after. This version was in Japanese and much more complete than previous versions. The emulation community was inspired by the release to improve Super FX chip handling in their Super NES emulators. A fan translation patch was also released which took four people and over 100 hours of work. The patch developers also changed a debug modifier that was set to zero, preventing Corneria from taking damage. All leaked ROMs are beta versions from before the game was finished. Some gameplay features do not work correctly, are incomplete, or hampered by software bugs. According to Cuthbert, all the leaked ROMs lack the final few months of QA work. They were also all set up in debug mode, so the encounter systems and randomized gameplay elements do not work correctly. Cuthbert claims the final version of the game is much better. Speaking about the final beta ROM, he said: \\"the basic parts are there, but there is an adage in game development, ‚ÄòThe last 10 percent is 90 percent of the game,‚Äô and the ROM is missing that last 10 percent of iteration -and -refinement.\\" ==Release== Star Fox 2 was released on the Super NES Classic Edition in 2017 For many years, the completed version of Star Fox 2 remained in Nintendo's archives. Super FX games were not considered for Nintendo's Virtual Console content distribution service because Nintendo had difficulty emulating the chip. In 2015, Miyamoto told journalists: \\"In my memory, I enjoyed [Star Fox 2] but I'm not sure I would release it, [...] I'd rather have people play a new game.\\" The company dug up Star Fox 2 during development of Star Fox Command (2006) to play it and gather inspiration for gameplay design. Cuthbert took part in this uncovering as his company Q-Games was co- developing Star Fox Command. When compiling a list of games to include on the Super NES Classic dedicated console, the system's producer proposed to include Star Fox 2. He thought it would be a waste otherwise to never release a completed and debugged game. The device was announced along with Star Fox 2's inclusion on June 26, 2017. The announcement came as a delightful surprise to Cuthbert. No one from Argonaut or Q-games was consulted or otherwise made aware ahead of the announcement. Some of the original developers celebrated the announcement. The Super NES Classic was released September 29, 2017 in North America and Europe, and October 5 in Japan. The version is the fully completed and localized English ROM that was completed back in the 1990s, though Cuthbert suspects Nintendo had to make minor changes like altering screen flashing to get it past modern regulations. Promotional artwork for Star Fox 2 was done by Takaya Imamura, the original Star Fox character designer. The game's instruction manual was released digitally online and included concept art and design documents. Kotaku noted how uncommon it is for Nintendo to release internal development documents like this. On December 4, 2019, Nintendo released a video of upcoming updates to its Nintendo Switch Online NES & Super NES services, available from December 12, 2019. The December Game Updates of Nintendo Switch Online Super NES included Star Fox 2 as a part of its portfolio of games, playable by those with Nintendo Switch Online membership. ==Reception== Star Fox 2 received mostly positive reviews upon its release on the Super NES Classic Edition. Reviewing Star Fox 2 on the Super NES Classic Edition, Eurogamer described it as \\"wonderfully surprising and inventive\\". Polygon described it as ambitious and fun. Nintendo World Report gave it 9/10 and wrote that it was \\"arguably the most important game in the Star Fox series, and one of the greatest Super Nintendo games\\". Nintendo Life gave the game 8/10, writing: \\"this 22-year-old relic is worth owning a SNES Mini for, and may well surprise you with its depth, complexity and challenge ‚Äì so long as you're not expecting a straight sequel to the original.\\" Destructoid gave it 7/10, describing it as \\"solid and definitely has an audience. There could be some hard-to-ignore faults, but the experience is fun.\\" IGN gave it 5/10, complementing its \\"janky-yet-plucky aesthetic\\", but complained that severe frame-rate drops plagued the game and that it was difficult to control the ships. They stated it was the worst game in the SNES Classic Edition and that, \\"Looking back, it probably deserved to be cancelled\\". ==Legacy== After Star Fox 2 was canceled, Argonaut's contract with Nintendo ended. Cuthbert was okay with this and desired to work with Sony or Namco on 3D PlayStation games anyway. He left Japan and moved to the United States to work with Sony. In 2001, he returned to Japan to establish Q-Games. The company collaborated with Nintendo in 2006 to develop Star Fox Command, and again in 2011 for Star Fox 64 3D. Cuthbert found the experimentation with Star Fox 2 personally helpful in his career. Star Fox 2 inspired the design of later Star Fox games. Free-range flying and tank gameplay were implemented into Star Fox 64, as was the character Wolf. Nintendo and Q-Games played Star Fox 2 to gather inspiration on its strategic gameplay elements for Star Fox Command. Miyamoto asked Cuthbert to make Command more similar to Star Fox 2 than Star Fox. The transforming Arwing ability and walker vehicle were re- introduced in Star Fox Zero (2016). The game also drove ideas for future Nintendo 64 games. Cuthbert believes a lot of the platforming experimentation they ran in Star Fox 2 gave Miyamoto confidence for Super Mario 64. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *Official Star Fox 2 website - Nintendo.co.jp *Design documents for StarFox 2 released by Nintendo - 1, 2 Category:2017 video games Category:Argonaut Games games Category:Nintendo games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Nintendo Switch Online SNES games Category:Star Fox video games Category:Super FX games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games produced by Shigeru Miyamoto Category:Video game sequels ","title":"Star Fox 2"},{"id":"825213","text":"is a Japanese politician.

Designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1989, she is now a museum ship in Honolulu, but her condition has deteriorated. She is currently not open to the public. In September 2008, ownership was transferred to a new nonprofit organization, the Friends of Falls of Clyde, which intends to restore her. Efforts to raise $1.5 million to get the ship into drydock have not succeeded . An additional $30 million may be needed to fully restore the ship. On February 7, 2019 the Hawaii Department of Transportation put the ship up for auction, but did not receive any qualified bids. ==History== Falls of Clyde was built in 1878 by Russell and Company in Port Glasgow, Inverclyde, Scotland, launched as the first of nine iron-hulled four-masted ships for Wright and Breakenridge's Falls Line. She was named after the Falls of Clyde, a group of waterfalls on the River Clyde, and built to the highest standard for general worldwide trade, Lloyd's Register A-1. Her maiden voyage took her to Karachi, now in Pakistan, and her first six years were spent engaged in the India trade. She then became a tramp pursuing general cargo such as lumber, jute, cement, and wheat from ports in Australia, California, India, New Zealand, and the British Isles. After twenty-one years as a British merchantman, Falls of Clyde was purchased for US$25,000 by Captain William Matson of the Matson Navigation Company, taken to Honolulu in 1899, and registered under the Hawaiian flag. When the Republic of Hawaii was annexed by the United States in 1900, it took a special act of the United States Congress to secure the foreign-built ship the right to sail as an American flag vessel. To economize on crew, Matson rigged Falls of Clyde down as a barque, replacing the five yards on her (jigger) mast with two more easily managed fore-and-aft sails. At the same time, he added a deckhouse, charthouse, and rearranged the after quarters to accommodate paying passengers. From 1899 to 1907, she made over sixty voyages between Hilo, Hawaii, and San Francisco, California, carrying general merchandise west, sugar east, and passengers both ways. She developed a reputation as a handy, fast, and commodious vessel, averaging 17 days each way on her voyages. In 1907, the Associated Oil Company (later Tidewater Oil) bought Falls of Clyde and converted her to a bulk oil tanker with a capacity of . Ten large steel tanks were built into her hull, and a pump room, boiler and generator fitted forward of an oil-tight bulkhead. In this configuration she brought kerosene to Hawaii and returned to California with molasses for cattle feed. Falls of Clyde In 1927, she was sold to the General Petroleum Company, her masts cut down, and converted into a floating fuel depot in Alaska. In 1959 she was purchased by William Mitchell, who towed her to Seattle, Washington, intending to sell her to a preservation group. Mitchell's plan fell through and subsequent efforts by Karl Kortum, director of the San Francisco Maritime Museum, and Fred Klebingat, who had sailed in her as chief mate in 1915, to place her in Long Beach, California, or Los Angeles, California, were similarly disappointed. In 1963, the bank holding the mortgage on Falls of Clyde decided to sell her to be sunk as part of a breakwater at Vancouver, British Columbia. Kortum and Klebingat aroused interest in the ship in Hawaii, and within days of the scheduled scuttling raised funds to buy the ship. At the end of October 1963, Falls of Clyde was taken under tow bound for Honolulu. ==Museum ship and controversy== Falls of Clyde (detail of the prow) Looking forward along the deck Falls of Clyde was given to the Bishop Museum and opened to the public in 1968. In 1970 the grandson of original 19th century designer William Lithgow was engaged to assist in her restoration as a full-rigged ship. Support came from Sir William Lithgow, the shipbuilder and industrialist, whose Port Glasgow shipyard donated new steel masts, and topgallants, jib and spanker booms of Oregon pine. In 1973 the ship was entered into the National Register of Historic Places, and declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1989. and The ship is now in poor condition. Causes of the deterioration of the ship are multiple. The ship has not been dry docked for a long time. Sandblasting arguably damaged the ship. Preventive maintenance was not performed, although it would have been relatively inexpensive. In fact, her long-time owner, the Bishop Museum, \\"has been accused of incompetence and dishonesty\\" for raising $600,000 to preserve the ship but then spending only about half that, and for other decisions on how the money that was spent. In 2008, the Bishop Museum announced plans to sink her by the end of the year unless private funds were raised for an endowment for her perpetual care. In September 2008 the Bishop Museum was persuaded to transfer ownership to the non-profit group Friends of Falls of Clyde, which intends to restore her. However, many artifacts and fixtures had been given away, taken, or otherwise disappeared on the assumption that the ship was to be scuttled. $350,000 was obtained from the Robert J. Pfeiffer Foundation, but hoped-for federal funds under the \\"Save America's Treasures\\" program or other programs did not come through. In each year since 2008, the Foundation has hoped to get her into drydock but has not succeeded . In June 2016 Harbors Division of the Hawaii Department of Transportation revoked the permit for her to moor at Pier 7, citing safety and security risks to port users. The Foundation has challenged the Harbors Division's assessment of the ship. ==Restoration and repatriation efforts== In August 2016 a group based in Glasgow, Scotland launched the Save Falls of Clyde ‚Äì International (FOCI) Campaign, with a view to have her returned to Scotland where she was originally built. Initially, They answered a call for help from the charity known as the ‚ÄòFriends of the Falls of Clyde‚Äô (FFOC) who owned and wanted to save the FOC from being scuttled by the Hawaiian Harbours Department. They quickly put together a plan to get her back to Scotland attempting to work with the Hawaiian Harbours department and building and executing a plan. ==Current efforts== The Hawaiian Harbors department has now filed for a \\"disposal\\" notice to the state department of historic artefacts. As the ship has been in Hawaii for over 50 years, it is now considered to be of cultural and historic importance, and the department has advised FOCI that the easiest way to take control of the Falls of Clyde is to bid as part of the \\"disposal\\" process. FOCI intends to bid, and has advised DOT harbours accordingly. Their proposal is to remove the FOC and repurpose her in a way that protects her heritage, but also offers a future that will support the marine environment and serve future generations of communities around the world. It appears that the state department for historic artefacts as well as the United States Coast Guard (USCG) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are not happy that \\"disposal\\" is the only course of action. The coast guard has the final sign off on the entire process and the understanding is that they are not happy for an unnecessary and dangerous step to be taken when there is an option to remove her safely on the table. The biggest fear is that the ship may sink in the narrow channel entrance or just outside the harbour; blocking Honolulu harbour for at least 6-12 months while a salvage operation takes place. FOCI have also been working with the support of the U.S. National Historic Maritime Society, seeking support from the National Park Service for their plans to repatriate her to Scotland. The ship is a registered National Historic Landmark. In Honolulu, Foss Marine, The Honolulu Pilots Association and others are offering their services and staff to support the operation. FOCI currently have an agreement in place with another lift ship company (Roll Dock) to take the FOC home in June 2020. However, due to the coronavirus outbreak, this is unlikely and the job has been pushed back to September 2020. In Scotland they have been, and are currently in, discussions with Inverclyde Council, Scotgov, Peel Ports, Strathclyde University, Caledonian University, Clyde Marine, Malin Group, Cleanships, Scottish Maritime Museum, Historic Environment Scotland, A.B.P., Glasgow Chambers of Commerce, North Ayrshire Council, Radio Clyde, The Clutha Trust, Crossroads and other groups to prepare for her arrival on the Clyde. ==Uses in popular culture== * The ship appears as a filming location in Magnum, P.I., Season 2, Episodes 5 and 6, \\"Memories are Forever\\" (November 5, 1981) and Season 6, Episode 10, \\"Blood and Honor\\" (November 21, 1985). ==References== ==Further reading== * * * == External links == * Hawai\`i Maritime Center * Maritime Heritage Program Information for the Falls of Clyde * Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum * Falls of Clyde on HawaiiWeb * Friends of Falls of Clyde website * Falls of Clyde International Ltd * Category:Ships built on the River Clyde Category:History of Inverclyde Category:Museum ships in Hawaii Category:National Historic Landmarks in Hawaii Category:Individual sailing vessels Category:Sailing ships of Scotland Category:Tall ships of the United Kingdom Category:Tall ships of the United States Category:Tankers of the United States Category:Museums in Honolulu Category:Four-masted ships Category:Windjammers Category:Oil tankers Category:Ships on the National Register of Historic Places in Hawaii Category:1878 ships Category:Full-rigged ships Category:Historic American Engineering Record in Hawaii Category:National Register of Historic Places in Honolulu Category:1878 in Scotland Category:Ships and vessels on the National Archive of Historic Vessels ","title":"Falls of Clyde (ship)"},{"id":"825306","text":"==B02A AntifibrinolyticsB02AA Amino acids=== :B02AA01 Aminocaproic acid :B02AA02 Tranexamic acid :B02AA03 Aminomethylbenzoic acid ===B02AB Proteinase inhibitors=== :B02AB01 Aprotinin :B02AB02 Alfa1 antitrypsin :B02AB04 Camostat :B02AB05 Ulinastatin ==B02B Vitamin K and other hemostaticsB02BA Vitamin K=== :B02BA01 Phytomenadione :B02BA02 Menadione ===B02BB Fibrinogen=== :B02BB01 Human fibrinogen ===B02BC Local hemostatics=== :B02BC01 Absorbable gelatin sponge :B02BC02 Oxidized cellulose :B02BC03 Tetragalacturonic acid hydroxymethylester :B02BC05 Adrenalone :B02BC06 Thrombin :B02BC07 Collagen :B02BC08 Calcium alginate :B02BC09 Epinephrine :B02BC30 Combinations ===B02BD Blood coagulation factors=== :B02BD01 Coagulation factor IX, II, VII and X in combination (Prothrombin complex concentrate) :B02BD02 Coagulation factor VIII :B02BD03 Factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity :B02BD04 Coagulation factor IX :B02BD05 Coagulation factor VII :B02BD06 von Willebrand factor and coagulation factor VIII in combination :B02BD07 Coagulation factor XIII :B02BD08 Coagulation factor VIIa :B02BD10 von Willebrand factor :B02BD11 Catridecacog :B02BD13 Coagulation factor X :B02BD14 Susoctocog alfa :B02BD30 Thrombin ===B02BX Other systemic hemostatics=== :B02BX01 Etamsylate :B02BX02 Carbazochrome :B02BX03 Batroxobin :B02BX04 Romiplostim :B02BX05 Eltrombopag :B02BX06 Emicizumab :B02BX07 Lusutrombopag :B02BX08 Avatrombopag :B02BX09 Fostamatinib ==References== B02 ","title":"ATC code B02"},{"id":"825332","text":"Purebreds, also called purebreeds, are cultivated varieties or cultivars of an animal species, achieved through the process of selective breeding. When the lineage of a purebred animal is recorded, that animal is said to be pedigreed. The term purebred is occasionally confused with the proper noun Thoroughbred, which refers exclusively to a specific breed of horse, one of the first breeds for which a written national stud book was created since the 18th century. Thus a purebred animal should never be called a \\"thoroughbred\\" unless the animal actually is a registered Thoroughbred horse. ==True breeding== In the world of selective animal breeding, to \\"breed true\\" means that specimens of an animal breed will breed true-to-type when mated like-to-like; that is, that the progeny of any two individuals in the same breed will show consistent, replicable and predictable characteristics. A puppy from two purebred dogs of the same breed, for example, will exhibit the traits of its parents, and not the traits of all breeds in the subject breed's ancestry. However, breeding from too small a gene pool, especially direct inbreeding, can lead to the passing on of undesirable characteristics or even a collapse of a breed population due to inbreeding depression. Therefore, there is a question, and often heated controversy, as to when or if a breed may need to allow \\"outside\\" stock in for the purpose of improving the overall health and vigor of the breed. Because pure-breeding creates a limited gene pool, purebred animal breeds are also susceptible to a wide range of congenital health problems. This problem is especially prevalent in competitive dog breeding and dog show circles due to the singular emphasis on aesthetics rather than health or function. Such problems also occur within certain segments of the horse industry for similar reasons. The problem is further compounded when breeders practice inbreeding. The opposite effect to that of the restricted gene pool caused by pure-breeding is known as hybrid vigor, which generally results in healthier animals. ==Pedigrees== A purebred Arabian horse. A pedigreed animal is one that has its ancestry recorded. Often this is tracked by a major registry. The number of generations required varies from breed to breed, but all pedigreed animals have papers from the registering body that attest to their ancestry. The word \\"pedigree\\" appeared in the English language in 1410 as \\"pee de Grewe\\", \\"pedegrewe\\" or \\"pedegru\\", each of those words being borrowed to the Middle French \\"pi√© de grue\\", meaning \\"crane foot\\". This comes from a visual analogy between the trace of the bird's foot and the three lines used in the English official registers to show the ramifications of a genealogical tree.History of dog pedigree in Europe http://www.braquedubourbonnais.info/en/pedigree.htm Sometimes the word purebred is used synonymously with pedigreed, but purebred refers to the animal having a known ancestry, and pedigree refers to the written record of breeding. Not all purebred animals have their lineage in written form. For example, until the 20th century, the Bedouin people of the Arabian peninsula only recorded the ancestry of their Arabian horses via an oral tradition, supported by the swearing of religiously based oaths as to the asil or \\"pure\\" breeding of the animal. Conversely, some animals may have a recorded pedigree or even a registry, but not be considered \\"purebred\\". Today the modern Anglo- Arabian horse, a cross of Thoroughbred and Arabian bloodlines, is considered such a case. ==Purebreds by animalPurebred dogs=== Pure-breed Zwergschnauzer A purebred dog is a dog of a modern breed of dog, with written documentation showing the individual purebred dog's descent from its breeds' foundation stock. In dogs, the term breed is used two ways: loosely, to refer to dog types or landraces of dog (also called natural breeds or ancient breeds); or more precisely, to refer to modern breeds of dog, which are documented so as to be known to be descended from specific ancestors, that closely resemble others of their breed in appearance, movement, way of working and other characters; and that reproduce with offspring closely resembling each other and their parents. Purebred dogs are breeds in the second sense. New breeds of dog are constantly being created, and there are many websites for new breed associations and breed clubs offering legitimate registrations for new or rare breeds. When dogs of a new breed are \\"visibly similar in most characteristics\\" and have reliable documented descent from a \\"known and designated foundation stock\\", then they can then be considered members of a breed, and, if an individual dog is documented and registered, it can be called purebred. ===Purebred horses=== The domestication of the horse resulted in a small number of domesticated stallions (possibly a single male ancestor) being crossed on wild mares that had adapted to local conditions. This ultimately produced horses of four basic body types, once thought to be wild prototypes, but now considered to be landraces. Many of these animals were then bred true to original type by selected breeding, though emphasizing certain inherent traits (such as a good temperament, suitable to training by humans) to a greater degree than others. In other cases, horses of different body types were cross bred until a desired characteristic was achieved and bred true. Written and oral histories of various animals or pedigrees of certain types of horse have been kept throughout history, though breed registry stud books trace back to about the 13th century, at least in Europe, when pedigrees were tracked in writing, and the practice of declaring a type of horse to be a breed or a purebred became more widespread. Certain horse breeds, such as the Andalusian horse and the Arabian horse, are claimed by aficionados of the respective breeds to be ancient, near-pure descendants from an ancient wild prototype, though mapping of the horse genome as well as the mtDNA and y-DNA of various breeds has largely disproved such claims. ===Purebred cats=== Purebred Himalayan A cat whose ancestry is formally registered is called a pedigreed or purebred cat. Technically, a purebred cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed. A pedigreed cat is one whose ancestry is recorded, but may have ancestors of different breeds. The list of cat breeds is quite large: most cat registries actually recognize between 30 and 40 breeds of cats, and several more are in development, with one or more new breeds being recognized each year on average, having distinct features and heritage. Owners and breeders compete in cat shows to see whose animal bears the closest resemblance (best conformance) to an idealized definition, based on breed type and the breed standard for each breed. Because of common crossbreeding in populated areas, many cats are simply identified as belonging to the mixed types of domestic long-haired and domestic short-haired cat, depending on their type of fur. Some original cat breeds that have a distinct phenotype that is the main type occurring naturally as the dominant domesticated cat type in their region of origin are sometimes considered subspecies and in the past received names as such, although this is no longer supported by feline biologists. with F. silvestris the wild cat and F. s. catus the domestic. Some of these cat breeds (with their invalid scientific names for historical interest) are: *F. catus anura - the Manx *F. catus siamensis - the Siamese *F. catus cartusenensis - the Chartreux *F. catus angorensis - the Turkish Angora ===Purebred livestock=== Purebred Barbados Blackbelly hair sheep. Charolais calves that were transferred as embryos, with their Angus and Hereford recipient mothers. Most domesticated farm animals also have true-breeding breeds and breed registries, particularly cattle, sheep, goats, rabbits, and pigs. While animals bred strictly for market sale are not always purebreds, or if purebred may not be registered, most livestock producers value the presence of purebred genetic stock for the consistency of traits such animals provide. It is common for a farm's male breeding stock in particular to be of purebred, pedigreed lines. In cattle, some breeders associations make a difference between \\"purebred\\" and \\"full blood\\". Full blood cattle are fully pedigreed animals, where every ancestor is registered in the herdbook and shows the typical characteristics of the breed. Purebred are those animals that have been bred- up to purebred status as a result of using full blood animals to cross with an animal of another breed. The breeders association rules the percentage of fullblood genetics required for an animal to be considered purebred, usually above 87.5%. Artificial breeding via artificial insemination or embryo transfer is often used in sheep and cattle breeding to quickly expand, or improve purebred herds. Embryo transfer techniques allow top quality female livestock to have a greater influence on the genetic advancement of a herd or flock in much the same way that artificial insemination has allowed greater use of superior sires.Embryo Transfer in Cattle Retrieved on 21 October 2008 ==Wild species, landraces, and purebred species== Breeders of purebred domesticated species discourage crossbreeding with wild species, unless a deliberate decision is made to incorporate a trait of a wild ancestor back into a given breed or strain. Wild populations of animals and plants have evolved naturally over millions of years through a process of natural selection in contrast to human controlled Selective breeding or artificial selection for desirable traits from the human point of view. Normally, these two methods of reproduction operate independently of one another. However, an intermediate form of selective breeding, wherein animals or plants are bred by humans, but with an eye to adaptation to natural region-specific conditions and an acceptance of natural selection to weed out undesirable traits, created many ancient domesticated breeds or types now known as landraces. Many times, domesticated species live in or near areas which also still hold naturally evolved, region-specific wild ancestor species and subspecies. In some cases, a domesticated species of plant or animal may become feral, living wild. Other times, a wild species will come into an area inhabited by a domesticated species. Some of these situations lead to the creation of hybridized plants or animals, a cross between the native species and a domesticated one. This type of crossbreeding, termed genetic pollution by those who are concerned about preserving the genetic base of the wild species, has become a major concern. Hybridization is also a concern to the breeders of purebred species as well, particularly if the gene pool is small and if such crossbreeding or hybridization threatens the genetic base of the domesticated purebred population. The concern with genetic pollution of a wild population is that hybridized animals and plants may not be as genetically strong as naturally evolved region specific wild ancestors wildlife which can survive without human husbandry and have high immunity to natural diseases. The concern of purebred breeders with wildlife hybridizing a domesticated species is that it can coarsen or degrade the specific qualities of a breed developed for a specific purpose, sometimes over many generations. Thus, both purebred breeders and wildlife biologists share a common interest in preventing accidental hybridization. == See also == {  valign=top  *Breed (includes lists of animal breeds) *Breed registry *Cat breed *Open stud book *Closed stud book *Consanguinity *Crossbreeding *Dog breed  valign=top  *Dog breeding *Dog hybrids and crossbreeds *Endogamy *Horse breeding *Inbreeding *Mixed-breed dog *Pedigreed animal documentation *Purebred (dog) } ==References== Category:Animal breeding Category:Livestock ","title":"Purebred"},{"id":"825382","text":"Consolidated Liberator aircraft of the Royal Air Force Coastal Command, 26 February 1944 The Leigh Light (L/L) was a British World War II era anti- submarine device used in the Battle of the Atlantic. It was a powerful (22 million candela) carbon arc searchlight of diameter fitted to a number of the British Royal Air Force's Coastal Command patrol bombers to help them spot surfaced German U-boats at night. Early night operations with the new Air-to- Surface Vessel radar (ASV) demonstrated that the radar's minimum range of about meant that the target was still invisible when it disappeared off the radar display. Efforts to reduce this minimum were not successful, so Wing Commander Humphrey de Verd Leigh hit upon the idea of using a searchlight that would be switched on just when the target was about to disappear on radar. The U-boat had insufficient time to dive and the bombardier had a clear view of the target. Introduced in June 1942, it was so successful that for a time German submarines were forced to switch to charging their batteries during the daytime, when they could at least see aircraft approaching. Germany introduced the Metox radar warning receiver in an effort to counter the combination of ASV and Leigh Light. Metox provided the submarine crew with early warning that an aircraft using radar was approaching. Because the radar warning receiver could detect radar emissions at a greater range than the radar could detect vessels, this often gave the U-boat enough warning to dive. Having expected this, the Allies introduced the centimetric ASV Mk. III radar, regaining control of the battle. Although the German Naxos countered these radars, by this time the U-boat force was already damaged beyond repair. ==Development== Early air-to-surface radar sets, namely the SV Mk. II, had an inconveniently long minimum detection range. Thus as the aircraft approached the target, it would disappear off the radar at a range that was too great to allow it to be seen by eye at night without some form of illumination. At first, aircraft solved this problem by dropping flares to light up the area, but since the flare only lit up the area directly under the aircraft, a string (a number of flares in succession) would have to be dropped until the submarine was spotted. Once it was spotted the aircraft would have to circle back to attack, the entire process giving the submarine a fair amount of time to dive out of danger. Eventually, time-delayed flares were developed that allowed the attacking plane time to circle. The flare was fired into the air from a buoy previously dropped by the plane. The surfaced submarine could then be seen in silhouette as the plane approached. Wing Commander Humphrey de Verd Leigh, an RAF personnel officer, came up with his own solution after chatting with returning aircrew. This was to mount a searchlight under the aircraft, pointed forward and allowing the submarine to be spotted as soon as the light was turned on. He then developed the Leigh Light entirely on his own, in secret and without official sanction‚Äîeven the Air Ministry were unaware of its development until shown the completed prototype.The Secret War, by Brian Johnson, Pen And Sword Military Classics, 1978, pages 216‚Äì217) At first it was difficult to fit on aircraft due to its size. Leigh persisted in his efforts to test the idea, and garnered the support of the Commander-in-Chief of Coastal Command, Sir Frederick Bowhill. In March 1941 a Vickers Wellington DWI that conveniently already had the necessary generator on board, (it had been used for anti-magnetic mining operations using a large electromagnet) was modified with a retractable \\"dustbin\\" holding the lamp, and proved the concept sound. At this point the Air Ministry decided that the idea was worthwhile, but that they should instead use the Turbinlite, a less effective system which had been originally developed as an aid for nighttime bomber interception. After trials they too eventually decided to use Leigh's system, but it was not until mid-1942 that aircraft started being modified to carry it. Development assistance and production was by Savage and Parsons Ltd. of Watford led by Jack Savage.Death of Jack Savage Flight 27 September 1945, page 350. Accessed October 2010 ==Operation== Photograph of a destroyed U-boat illuminated in Leigh Lights Two types of Leigh Light entered operational use: #The Turret type, fitted on Wellington aircraft, was a searchlight mounted in a retractable under-turret controlled by hydraulic motor and ram. The maximum beam intensity was 50 million candelas without the spreading lens and about 20 million candelas with the lens. Total weight was . #The Nacelle type, fitted on Catalinas and Liberators, was a searchlight mounted in a nacelle in diameter slung from the bomb lugs on the wing. The controls were electric and the maximum beam intensity was 90 million candelas without the spreading lens and about 17 million with the lens. Total weight was . By June 1942, aircraft equipped with ASV radar and the Leigh Light were operating over the Bay of Biscay intercepting U-boats moving to and from their home ports on the coast of France. The first submarine to be successfully sighted was the Italian submarine Torelli, on the night of 3 June 1942, and the first confirmed kill was the , sunk on 5 July 1942 by a Vickers Wellington of 172 Squadron, piloted by American Wiley B. Howell. In the previous five months not one submarine had been sunk, and six aircraft had been lost. The Leigh Light turned the tables, and by August the U-boats preferred to take their chances in daytime when they at least had some warning and could fight back. At least one Fairey Swordfish I biplane torpedo bomber was trialled with a Leigh Light under the lower port wing, with a large battery pack slung under the fuselage where the torpedo would normally be carried. The armament was a rack of anti-submarine bombs carried under the other wing. With such a heavy load performance was poor with a top speed marginally above the stall speed.Brown, Eric Wings on my Sleeve A Swordfish III was also fitted with a Leigh Light under the starboard wing, at some point, though it is unclear where the battery pack was stowed as the ASV radar scanner apparently filled the torpedo area. Wing Commander Peter Cundy was also given the Air Force Cross for his part in the development of the Leigh Light. ==Training== The Observation Post at Putsborough overlooking Morte Bay The Indicator arrow at Putsborough overlooking Morte Bay The observation post and concrete indicator arrow at Putsborough were built for Leigh Light training. A buoy anchored in Morte Bay was used as a target. Two other sites at Woolacombe and midway along the bay provided triangulation to assess the accuracy of the bombing attempt. ==References== ==External links== *Technical details of the Leigh Light Category:Military aviation Category:World War II military equipment of the United Kingdom Category:Searchlights ","title":"Leigh Light"},{"id":"825390","text":"In probability theory, Luce's choice axiom, formulated by R.

Crossbreeding, sometimes called \\"designer crossbreeding\\", is the process of breeding such an organism, often with the intention to create offspring that share the traits of both parent lineages, or producing an organism with hybrid vigor. While crossbreeding is used to maintain health and viability of organisms, irresponsible crossbreeding can also produce organisms of inferior quality or dilute a purebred gene pool to the point of extinction of a given breed of organism. A domestic animal of unknown ancestry, where the breed status of only one parent or grandparent is known, may also be called a crossbreed though the term \\"mixed breed\\" is technically more accurate. Outcrossing is a type of crossbreeding used within a purebred breed to increase the genetic diversity within the breed, particularly when there is a need to avoid inbreeding. In animal breeding, crossbreeds are crosses within a single species, while hybrids are crosses between different species. In plant breeding terminology, the term crossbreed is uncommon, and no universal term is used to distinguish hybridization or crossing within a population from those between populations, or even those between species. == Designer crossbreed == A designer crossbreed or designer breed is a crossbred animal that has purebred parents, usually registered with a breed registry, but from two different breeds. These animals are the result of a deliberate decision to create a specific crossbred animal. Less often, the animal may have more than two pure breeds in its ancestry, but unlike a mutt or a mongrel, its entire pedigree is known to descend from specific known animals. While the term is best-known when applied to certain dog crossbreeds, other animals such as cattle, horses, birds and cats may also be bred in this fashion. Some crossbred breeders start a freestanding breed registry to record designer crossbreds, other crossbreds may be included in an \\"appendix\\" to an existing purebred registry. either form of registration may be the first step in recording and tracking pedigrees in order to develop a new breed. The purpose of creating designer crossbreds is usually one or more of the following reasons: # to breed animals with heterosis, commonly known as \\"hybrid vigor\\", # to create animals with more predictable characteristics than mixed breed or mongrel breeding, # to avoid certain undesirable recessive traits that lead to genetic diseases that plague many purebred animals, # to develop an animal that combines what are viewed as the best traits of two or more breeds, # as the preliminary steps toward developing a new animal breed. Breeders of designer crossbreds borrow the technical language from hybrid plant breeding: A first generation, 50‚Äì50 crossbred is an F1 cross. Subsequent generations may see a purebred animal crossed back on a crossbred, creating a 75/25 cross, or a BC1 or F1b \\"backcross.\\" The breeding of two crossbreeds of the same combination of breeds, creating a F2 cross, an animal that is still a 50‚Äì50 cross, but it is the second filial generation of the combination. A F2 cross bred to an F2 cross creates a F3 cross. Similarly, a F2 animal bred to an F1 animal creates a F2b backcross. F3 crosses and greater are called \\"multi- generational\\" crosses. In dog breeding, three generations of reliable documented breeding can be considered a \\"breed\\" rather than a crossbreed. There are disadvantages to creating designer crossbreeds, notably the potential that the cross will be of inferior quality or that it will not produce as consistent a result as would breeding purebred animals. For example, the Poodle is a frequent breed used in creation of designer crossbreeds, due to its non-shedding coat, but that trait does not always breed true when it is part of a designer cross. Also, because breeders of crossbred animals may be less careful about genetic testing and weeding out undesirable traits, certain deleterious dominant genes may still be passed on to a crossbreed offspring. In an F2 cross, recessive genetic traits may also return if the parent animals were both carriers of an undesired trait. == Crossbreeds in specific animals  Cats === The many newly developed and recognized breeds of domestic cat are crossbreeds between existing, well- established breeds (sometimes with limited hybridization with some wild species), to either combine selected traits from the foundation stock, or propagate a rare mutation without excessive inbreeding. However, some nascent breeds such as the Aegean cat are developed entirely from a local landrace population. Most experimental cat breeds are crossbreeds. === Cattle === In cattle, there are systems of crossbreeding. In many crossbreeds, one animal is larger than the other. One is used when the purebred females are particularly adapted to a specific environment, and are crossed with purebred bulls from another environment to produce a generation having traits of both parents.Cross breeding systems for beef cattle larger Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries, Queensland === Sheep === The large number of breeds of sheep, which vary greatly, creates an opportunity for crossbreeding to be used to tailor production of lambs to the goal of the individual stockman.Crossbreeding In Sheep, by Angie Bailey, Jason Canup and Jorge Lucena Purdue University, US === Llamas === Results of crossbreeding classic and woolly breeds of llama are unpredictable. The resulting offspring displays physical characteristics of either parent, or a mix of characteristics from both, periodically producing a fleeced llama. The results are increasingly unpredictable when both parents are crossbreeds, with possibility of the offspring displaying characteristics of a grandparent, not obvious in either parent. === Dogs === A crossbred dog is a cross between two (sometimes more) known breeds, and is usually distinguished from a mixed-breed dog, which has ancestry from many sources, some of which may not be known. Crossbreeds are popular, due to the belief that they have increased vigor without loss of attractiveness of the dog. Certain planned crossbreeding between purebred dogs of different breeds are now widely known as \\"designer dogs\\"and can produce puppies worth more than their purebred parents, due to a high demand. ===Horses=== The National Show Horse was developed from crossbreeding programs in the 1970s and 1980s that blended Arabian horse and American Saddlebred bloodlines Crossbreeding in horses is often done with the intent of ultimately creating a new breed of horse. One type of modern crossbreeding in horses is used to create many of the warmblood breeds. Warmbloods are a type of horse used in the sport horse disciplines, usually registered in an open stud book by a studbook selection procedure that evaluates conformation, pedigree and, in some animals, a training or performance standard. Most warmblood breeds began as a cross of draft horse breeds on Thoroughbreds, but have, in some cases, developed over the past century to the point where they are considered to be a true-breeding population and have a closed stud book. Other types of recognized crossbreeding include that within the American Quarter Horse, which will register horses with one Thoroughbred parent and one registered Quarter Horse parent in the \\"Appendix\\" registry, and allow such animals full breed registration status as Quarter Horses if they meet a certain performance standard. Another well-known crossbred horse is the Anglo-Arabian, which may be produced by a purebred Arabian horse crossed on a Thoroughbred, or by various crosses of Anglo-Arabians with other Anglo-Arabians, as long as the ensuing animal never has more than 75% or less than 25% of each breed represented in its pedigree. == Hybrid animals == A hybrid animal is one with parentage of two separate species, differentiating it from crossbred animals, which have parentage of the same species. Hybrids are usually, but not always, sterile. One of the most ancient types of hybrid animal is the mule, a cross between a female horse and a male donkey. The liger is a hybrid cross between a male lion and female tiger. The yattle is a cross between a cow and a yak. Other crosses include the tigon (between a male tiger and female lion) and yakalo (between a yak and buffalo). The Incas recognized that hybrids of Lama glama (llama) and Vicugna pacos (alpaca) resulted in a hybrid with none of the advantages of either parent. At one time it was thought that dogs and wolves were separate species, and the crosses between dogs and wolves were called wolf hybrids. Today wolves and dogs are both recognized as Canis lupus, but the old term \\"wolf hybrid\\" is still used. == Mixed breeds == A mixed-breed animal is defined as having undocumented or unknown parentage, while a crossbreed generally has known, usually purebred parents of two distinct breeds or varieties. A dog of unknown parentage is often called a mixed-breed dog, \\"mutt\\" or \\"mongrel.\\" A cat of unknown parentage is often referred to as a domestic short-haired or domestic long-haired cat generically, and in some dialects is often called a \\"moggie\\". A horse of unknown bloodlines is called a grade horse. ==See also== * Artificial selection * Canid hybrid * Heterosis * Introgression * Selective breeding == References == Category:Animal breeding Category:Breeding ","title":"Crossbreed"},{"id":"825408","text":"==B03A Iron preparationsB03AA Iron bivalent, oral preparations=== :B03AA01 Ferrous glycine sulfate :B03AA02 Ferrous fumarate :B03AA03 Ferrous gluconate :B03AA04 Ferrous carbonate :B03AA05 Ferrous chloride :B03AA06 Ferrous succinate :B03AA07 Ferrous sulfate :B03AA08 Ferrous tartrate :B03AA09 Ferrous aspartate :B03AA10 Ferrous ascorbate :B03AA11 Ferrous iodine :B03AA12 Ferrous sodium citrate ===B03AB Iron trivalent, oral preparations=== :B03AB01 Ferric sodium citrate :B03AB02 Saccharated iron oxide :B03AB03 Sodium feredetate :B03AB04 Ferric hydroxide :B03AB05 Ferric oxide polymaltose complexes :B03AB07 Chondroitin sulfate-iron complex :B03AB08 Ferric acetyl transferrin :B03AB09 Ferric proteinsuccinylate :B03AB10 Ferric maltol :QB03AB90 Iron dextran complexes ===B03AC Iron, parenteral preparations=B03AD Iron in combination with folic acid=== :B03AD01 Ferrous amino acid complex :B03AD02 Ferrous fumarate :B03AD03 Ferrous sulfate :B03AD04 Ferric oxide polymaltose complexes ===B03AE Iron in other combinations=== :B03AE01 Iron, vitamin B12 and folic acid :B03AE02 Iron, multivitamins and folic acid :B03AE03 Iron and multivitamins :B03AE04 Iron, multivitamins and minerals :B03AE10 Various combinations ==B03B Vitamin B12 and folic acidB03BA Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin and analogues)=== :B03BA01 Cyanocobalamin :B03BA02 Cyanocobalamin tannin complex :B03BA03 Hydroxocobalamin :B03BA04 Cobamamide :B03BA05 Mecobalamin :B03BA51 Cyanocobalamin, combinations :B03BA53 Hydroxocobalamin, combinations ===B03BB Folic acid and derivatives=== :B03BB01 Folic acid :B03BB51 Folic acid, combinations ==B03X Other antianemic preparationsB03XA Other antianemic preparations=== :B03XA01 Erythropoietin :B03XA02 Darbepoetin alfa :B03XA03 Methoxy polyethylene glycol- epoetin beta :B03XA04 Peginesatide :B03XA05 Roxadustat :B03XA06 Luspatercept ==References== B03 ","title":"ATC code B03"},{"id":"825428","text":"Pat Sajak ( , born Patrick Leonard ; October 26, 1946) is an American television personality, former weatherman, and talk show host, best known as the host of the American television game show Wheel of Fortune. For his work on Wheel, Sajak has received 19 nominations for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host, winning 3 times. ==Early life== Born in Chicago on October 26, 1946, Sajak was also raised there, the son of Joyce Helen (Brandecka) and Leonard Anthony Sajdak, a factory worker, who died when Sajak was young. All of his grandparents were Polish. After Sajak's father's death, his mother married Walter Backal. Sajak graduated from Farragut High School in 1964, then went to Columbia College Chicago while working as a desk clerk at the Palmer House hotel. He served in the U.S. Army as a disc jockey during the Vietnam War for American Forces Vietnam Network. Sajak hosted the same Dawn Buster radio show that Adrian Cronauer had, and for 14 months followed Cronauer's tradition of signing on with \\"Good Morning Vietnam!\\" ==Career== Sajak won a contest on WLS radio's Dick Biondi Show to be a guest teen deejay. While at Columbia College Chicago, his broadcasting instructor Al Parker told him that a local radio station (WEDC) was looking for a newsman. Sajak applied for the job and was hired to work from midnight to 6:00 a.m. In 1968, Sajak joined the U.S. Army and was sent to Vietnam, where he served as a disc jockey on Armed Forces Radio. On the Military Channel's program, An Officer and a Movie, Sajak admitted to botching President Richard Nixon's 1969 Christmas broadcast to the troops; he accidentally cut the feed off prematurely. Upon realizing the error, he decided it would be best not to resume the feed. In the early 1970s, Sajak DJed for a Murray, Kentucky, radio station for a year. Also in the early 1970s, Sajak began DJing at 50,000-watt WSM in Nashville; at the time, WSM was playing pop music during the day, and he was the 3:00‚Äì5:00pm afternoon personality. The radio station's television sister, WSM-TV (now WSMV), brought Sajak on screen, first as a voiceover artist doing station identifications and anchoring the five-minute newscasts during NBC's Today Show, then as a weekend and substitute weatherman, where he became acquainted with anchor Dan Miller. In 1977, KNBC-TV in Los Angeles was looking for a weatherman, and spotted Sajak working in Nashville. Sajak accepted KNBC's request for him to be a full-time weatherman for the station. In 1981, Merv Griffin asked Sajak if he would be interested in taking over the duties as host on Wheel of Fortune from Chuck Woolery. However, Fred Silverman, then president and CEO of NBC, rejected his hiring, claiming he was too local, and Griffin responded by imposing a moratorium on new tapings until Sajak was hired.Griffin, Merv. Merv: Making the Good Life Last. New York: Pocket Books, 2003, page 101 The issue became moot when Silverman was dismissed due to repeated programming failures and replaced by Brandon Tartikoff. Sajak, who had already hosted two game show pilots in 1980, Press Your Luck for Ralph Edwards (no relation to the 1983 CBS game show of the same name) and Puzzlers for Mark Goodson, accepted the position. He hosted both the daytime (NBC) and syndicated evening versions of Wheel from 1983 to 1989, and continues to host the latter version. With Sajak returning for his 36th season in 2018‚Äì19, he became the longest-running host of any game show, surpassing Bob Barker, who hosted The Price Is Right from 1972 to 2007. Sajak was officially honored as such by the Guinness World Records with the episode taped March 22, 2019 and aired May 8, 2019 (two days before the primetime version's 7,000th episode). Sajak had a small role as a Buffalo, New York, newscaster in the 1982 comedy film Airplane II: The Sequel. When his late-night talk show on CBS premiered in January 1989, he left the daytime version of Wheel, and was replaced by former San Diego Chargers place-kicker Rolf Benirschke. Sajak appeared on Super Password several times from 1984 to 1989, as well as Password Plus in 1981, shortly before taking on hosting duties on Wheel. Other game shows on which Sajak guested were Dream House and Just Men!. Sajak was grand marshal of the National Memorial Day Parade in 2011. Sajak hosted a short-lived late- night talk show on CBS from January 9, 1989 to April 13, 1990. Dan Miller, Sajak's old friend and former anchor at WSM-TV in Nashville, joined Sajak as his sidekick. Sajak later became a frequent guest host for CNN's Larry King Live when King was unable to attend.Sajak hosted at least eight episodes of Larry King Live, including December 26, 2000; May 3, 2001; May 7, 2001; May 8, 2001; May 9, 2001; May 10, 2001; June 4, 2001; and January 5, 2003, according to CNN transcripts. He also became a regular substitute host for Regis Philbin on the syndicated Live with Regis and Kelly. Sajak also hosted a program, Pat Sajak Weekend, on the Fox News Channel in 2003. From at least 2002, he hosted The Pat Sajak Baseball Hour, a syndicated weekly radio sports talk show that ended in 2006 due to scheduling conflicts. Sajak is an external director of conservative publishing house Eagle PublishingRegnery Publishing: \\"Eagle Publishing Corporate Information\\" and is on the board of trustees at Hillsdale College in southern Michigan, currently as vice chairman. He has written for Human Events and served on the board of directors for the Claremont Institute. In 1983, Sajak portrayed Kevin Hathaway in the NBC daytime soap opera Days of Our Lives. In 1993, Sajak appeared as himself on the popular children's cartoon show Rugrats. In 1997, Sajak pulled an April Fool's Day prank on fans when he and Vanna White were contestants on an episode of Wheel hosted by Alex Trebek. The winnings of both Sajak and White were donated to charity (in this case, the American Cancer Society and the Boy Scouts of America). In return, Sajak hosted a regular episode of Jeopardy! in place of Trebek. He also appeared at the beginning of a 2010 April Fool's episode, along with Jeff Probst and Neil Patrick Harris. In 2001, he appeared as himself in the episode \\"Inner Tube\\" on the sitcom The King of Queens. Sajak began writing for the National Review Online in 2010. In his first post he questioned whether public employees should be allowed to vote on issues that would benefit them directly. He also has contributed to the center-right socio-political / social networking website, Ricochet.com. Sajak also is the author of several puzzle games, the first and best-known of them being \\"Lucky Letters\\", which debuted in 2007. The games, which Sajak developed with puzzle developer David L. Hoyt, are syndicated through Universal Uclick.PatSajakGames.com. Retrieved December 25, 2011. Sajak has also appeared on episodes of ESPN Radio's The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz, as well as Le Batard's other show, Highly Questionable. On May 8, 2019, Sajak broke the world record for having the longest career as game show host for the same show, hosting Wheel of Fortune for 38 years and 198 days. Sajak is signed as a host of Wheel of Fortune until 2022. ==In popular culture== Sajak with Vanna White in 2006 Pat Sajak was parodied in a 1980s Sesame Street sketch, with a Muppet named Pat Playjacks hosting \\"Squeal of Fortune\\". The goal was for the contestants (Prairie Dawn and The Count) to guess how many times a pig in the center of the wheel would squeal before the wheel stopped. During the 1980s, comedian Martin Short frequently portrayed a fictional character he called Ed Grimley, a hyperactive manchild who is obsessed with banal popular culture ‚Äì Sajak in particular ‚Äì on the sketch comedy television shows SCTV and Saturday Night Live. In 1986, Sajak and his Wheel of Fortune co-star Vanna White portrayed themselves on an episode of the NBC sitcom 227. In the fourth episode of season three of Comedy Central's Brickleberry, \\"That Brother's My Father\\", Pat Sajak gets kidnapped and becomes a hostage to the wheel of fortune. In the 1994 Rugrats episode \\"Chuckie is Rich\\", Pat Sajak awards Chaz with $10 million. His son, Pat Sajak Jr. appeared in the episode as well as one of the children in the wealthy daycare. Pat Sajak also voices himself in the episode. In the 4th season episode of The A-Team called \\"Wheel of Fortune\\", Pat Sajak makes a cameo along with co-star Vanna White. In the episode, Murdock wins big at Wheel of Fortune thanks to Face's system of guessing the letters correctly. In 1992, Sajak was a special guest star in the TV show The Commish. The episode first aired on November 7, 1992, and was called \\"The Two Faces Of Ed\\".

He homesteaded a farm in the Chauvin district, near Wainwright, Alberta.Edmonton Bulletin, 22 June 1921 Prior to winning the VC Harcus Strachan was initiated into freemasonry in his birthplace, at the Douglas Lodge 409 Bo'ness, on 22 January 1917.http://www.scotlandswar.ed.ac.uk/sites/default/files/pdf_Scottish_VCs_0.pdf ==World War I== Strachan joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force in July 1915.Canadian Great War Project Strachan was 33 years of age, and serving in the First World War with the Canadian Cavalry Brigade as a lieutenant in The Fort Garry Horse, when he performed the action for which he was awarded the VC. It has become traditional for the Garrys to hold a Regimental dinner every year on the anniversary of Strachan's unlikely cavalry exploit. The action occurred during the Battle of Cambrai. It occurred on 20 November 1917 at Masni√®res, France, after Lieutenant Strachan took command of the mounted squadron of Garrys when his commanding officer, 'B' Squadron leader Captain Campbell, was killed by machine gun fire.Williams, Jeffery, Byng of Vimy, Pen and Sword Military, Barnsley, 2014 p.188 Believing that the 29th Division with tanks already held the village of Masnieres, Brig. Gen. Nelson of the 88th Brigade, ordered the Fort Garry Horse to advance across the St Quentin Canal. On approaching the river bridge in front of Masnieres, the Garrys could see that the town was still held by the enemy and that the bridge across the St Quentin Canal was broken. The Garrys then found the Hampshire Regiment were crossing, in single file, over the lock gates. Tearing up a wooden pier, they built a bridge suitable for horses to cross. By 4pm 'B' Squadron set out through a gap in the enemy wire, and approached the German front line at a gallop. B Squadron leader Capt. Campbell was killed, and Strachan took command, leading 'B' Squadron at the gallop across the countryside toward Rumilly. Due to the state of the crossing at Masnieres and the limited available daylight Major-Gen W. H. Greenly commanding 2nd Cavalry Division, ordered any large-scale cavalry action to halt and ordered the recall of the units that had crossed the Canal. Neither Lt. Col. RW Patterson, commanding the Fort Garry Horse nor mounted orderlies, could find 'B' Squadron who were south-east of Rumilly to give them the recall order. B Squadron led by Strachan, cut its way through a line of infantry in a heavily camouflaged road and found a four-gunned German field battery in front of them. They charged, and rode down or sabred the gunners. German infantry positioned beyond the guns fired on them and again Strachan led a charge, They broke the infantry but were under fire, taking more casualties as they rode towards Rumilly. Now with less than fifty men and only five unwounded horses, they sheltered in a sunken road 1,200 yards east of the town. Strachan realised there was to be no support, so he had the horses cut loose and he led the unit in a withdrawal towards the Canal. During this fighting withdrawal, B Squadron scattered four bodies of German troops.Williams p.189 In short, Lieutenant Strachan led the squadron through the enemy line of machine-gun posts and then, with the surviving men, led the charge on the German battery, killing seven of the gunners with his sword. When all the gunners were killed and the battery silenced, he rallied his men and fought his way back at night on foot through the enemy's lines, bringing all unwounded men safely in, together with 15 prisoners. His citation reads: Strachan, having been promoted to captain, received his VC from King George V on 6 January 1918. ==Later life== After the war, he returned to his farm in the Chauvin district, Alberta Edmonton Bulletin, 22 June 1921 He ran as a Liberal candidate in the 1921 Alberta provincial election, in the Wainwright constituency, but was not elected, a victim of the Farmers' sweep.

After the war he retired and moved to Vancouver. Strachan eventually attained the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1967 he voiced his disdain for the U.S. proponents of the U.S.-Vietnam War.

Comprising and stretching inland to Happy Valley-Goose Bay, it forms part of the largest estuary in the province, primarily draining the Churchill River and Naskaupi River watersheds. Both Lake Melville and Hamilton Inlet are encircled by mountains, with primary settlements at Happy Valley-Goose Bay, North West River, and Sheshatshiu. ==Name== Lake Melville was named for Henry Dundas, first Viscount Melville, who served as Britain's lord of the Admiralty in 1804 and 1805. ==Geography== Lake Melville is situated in central Labrador. To the south are the Mealy Mountains while another inlet (Double Mer) is located to the north. The Churchill River flows into the southwest point of Lake Melville. Lake Melville extends further inland between the communities of North West River and Sheshatshiu and these extensions are known as \\"Little Lake\\" and \\"Grand Lake\\". The Naskaupi River flows into Grand Lake. Lake Melville is served by the Trans-Labrador Highway network. Route 500 spans from the mouth of the Churchill River at Happy Valley-Goose Bay to Labrador West while Route 510 goes from Happy Valley-Goose Bay to Blanc-Sablon where a ferry can be taken to Newfoundland. Route 520 is a paved highway on the west coast of Lake Melville connecting Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Sheshatshiu and North West River. Rigolet and Mud Lake are the only two communities in the region that cannot be reached by road. ==History== The area around Lake Melville was historically inhabited by the Inuit and the Innu. It is believed that Labrador's Inuit migrated to Labrador from Baffin Island in search of Europeans (the Norse are thought to have landed at Baffin Island around 1000 AD).Southern Inuit of NunatuKavut: the Historical Background At the end of the Seven Years' War, New France (including Labrador) was ceded to Great Britain. The British decided to develop a cod fishery in Labrador. The fishermen (who mostly came from Newfoundland), often married Inuit women and thus created the \\"Inuit-Metis\\". In 1824, the population around Lake Melville was 326 which consisted of 160 Inuit, 60 'half-Inuit', 90 European settlers, and 16 Canadian settlers.Southern Inuit of NunatuKavut: the Historical Background The economy around Lake Melville was historically based around the fishery and fur. Fort Smith (present-day North West River) was the seat of the Hudson's Bay Company factor for the surrounding territory. After John McLean discovered convenient riverine routes into the interior, it also was the supply centre for Fort Naskaupi. Fish and fur prices plummeted with the stock market crash beginning in 1929, weakening the meager though meaningful subsistence-based economy. Construction of an air base at Goose Bay in 1941 and radar installations along the coast offered Southern Inuit their first wage employment. Today, the town of Happy Valley-Goose Bay is one of the largest communities in Labrador and the tenth-largest community in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd- pl/Table-Tableau.cfm?LANG=Eng&T;=302&SR;=1&S;=5&O;=D&RPP;=25&PR;=10 The Lower Churchill Project is a planned hydroelectric project on the lower Churchill River. ==Transportation== A ferry service runs on Lake Melville and Hamilton Inlet, connecting a number communities including Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Rigolet and Cartwright. ==ReferencesCitations=Bibliography=== * . ==External links== *Information on area ferry services *Satellite map and information on Lake Melville * A map of Labrador with Hamilton Inlet shown as excluding L.

In his obituary, Wisden described him as the greatest wicket-keeper- batsman of all time. He is the only wicket-keeper-batsman to score a hundred first-class centuries. ==Early career== Born in Elham, Kent, in 1905, he was mentored by Francis MacKinnon, an ex-county player who lived in the village and then, after leaving the Harvey Grammar School, Folkestone, by Gerry Weigall, the Kent county coach, who encouraged him to learn to keep wicket so he would have a better chance of playing for the county as an all- rounder.Close of Play by Les Ames ‚Äì Published in 1953 by Stanley Paul He received the call to play for Kent while playing in West Malling and made his debut for the county on 7 July 1926 against Warwickshire at the Nevill Ground in Royal Tunbridge Wells.

He took 74 catches and made 23 stumpings. In first-class cricket, he scored 37,248 runs at an average of 43.51, including 102 centuries and 176 fifties, and took 704 catches and 417 stumpings. Unusually for a wicket-keeper, he also bowled over 200 overs, taking 24 first- class wickets with a bowling average of 33.37. Ames was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1929. He holds a number of wicket-keeping and batting records: *the most dismissals in an English county cricket season (127 in 1929); *the most stumpings in an English season (64 in 1932); *1000 runs and 100 dismissals in each of three seasons (1928, 1929, 1932), a feat that has only been achieved once again in county cricket; *the only wicket-keeper to score 100 first-class centuries; *in 1934 he was the last Englishman to score 100 or more runs before lunch in a Test match until Ian Bell did so seventy years later. Ames scored 120 runs in the session which is a record for most runs before lunch in Test cricket; *centuries against every English first-class county, apart from his own county, Kent; *the record 8th wicket partnership for England in Test cricket: 246 with Gubby Allen against New Zealand at Lord's in 1931. This record was finally broken by Jonathan Trott and Stuart Broad in 2010 when they scored 332 runs; *the first wicket-keeper to score a century batting at number seven in Test Cricket. After his final playing season in 1951, Ames became a successful manager and administrator. He managed MCC tours to the West Indies in 1967/68 when he deemed in his post- tour report that Basil D'Oliveira was a 'bad tourist' who did not adjust well to overseas conditions, spent much of his time partying, and generally detracted from team morale. This had it has been argued some role in justifying the original non-selection of D'Oliveira for the 1968/9 tour to South Africa. When that tour was cancelled he managed the subsequent replacement visit to Sri Lanka and Pakistan in 1968/69. In 1950 he had been the first professional to be appointed as a Test selector,David Frith, Bodyline Autopsy, ABC Books, Sydney, 2002, p. 435. continuing until 1956 and serving again in 1958. He was the secretary and manager of Kent County Cricket Club, including when the side won the County Championship in 1970. ==Outside cricket== Ames joined football club Clapton Orient in 1926 making his League debut against Preston North End in January 1927 and a total of 14 senior appearances in five seasons, before briefly playing for Gillingham in 1931, where he made five appearances and scored one goal. His cricketing career was interrupted by the Second World War, during which Ames served with the Royal Air Force rising to the rank of Squadron Leader.

A less-common version in France is tartare aller-retour, a mound of mostly raw ground meat that is lightly seared on both sides. == History The Tatars and raw meat=== A popular caricature of Mongol warriors‚Äîcalled Tatars or Tartars‚Äîhas them tenderizing meat under their saddles, then eating it raw. This story was popularized by Jean de Joinville in the 13th century. But Joinville never encountered Mongols himself and used this as a way of showing that they were uncivilized.Nata≈°a Polgar, \\"Joinville: A Hagiographic Story about Oneself and About the Other\\", Narodna umjetnost: hrvatski ƒçasopis za etnologiju i folkloristiku 45:1:21-41 (2008), p. 31, 39 It is possible that this story was a confusion originating in the use of thin slices of meat to protect saddle sores from further rubbing.The Raw Truth: Don't Blame the Mongols (or Their Horses) ===Popularization of raw meat in Europe and the United States=== In the late 19th century, the Hamburg steak became popular on the menus of many restaurants in the port of New York. This kind of fillet was beef minced by hand, lightly salted and often smoked, and usually served raw in a dish along with onions and bread crumbs.1802, \\"Oxford English Dictionary\\" Hamburg steak gained popularity because of its ease of preparation and decreasing cost. This is evident from its detailed description in some of the most popular cookbooks of the day. Documents show that this preparation style was used by 1887 in some U.S. restaurants and was also used for feeding patients in hospitals; the Hamburg steak was served raw or lightly cooked and was accompanied by a raw egg. It is not known when the first restaurant recipe for steak tartare appeared.Prosper Montagn√© (1938), \\"Larousse gastronomique\\" While not providing a clear name, it's possible that the dish was popularized in Paris by restaurateurs who misunderstood Jules Verne's description of \\"Koulbat\\" (\\"...a patty of crushed meat and eggs...\\") in his 1875 novel Michael Strogoff. Emmanuel Guillemain d'Echon, Dans les steaks de l‚ÄôAsie tartare, 17 August 2015 ===Origins of the name=== In the early twentieth century, what is now generally known as \\"steak tartare\\", was in Europe called steack √† l'Americaine. One variation on that dish included serving it with tartar sauce; the 1921 edition of Escoffier's Le Guide Culinaire defines \\"Steack √† la tartare\\" as steack √† l'Americaine made without egg yolk, served with tartar sauce on the side. \\"Steack √† la tartare\\" (literally meaning \\"served with tartar sauce\\") was later shorted to \\"steak tartare\\"Albert Jack, What Caesar Did for My Salad: Not to Mention the Earl's Sandwich, Pavlova's Meringue and Other Curious Stories Behind Our Favourite Food, 2010, , p. 141 at Google Books Over time, the distinction between steack √† l'Americaine and its tartar- sauce variant disappeared. The 1938 edition of Larousse Gastronomique describes steak tartare as raw ground beef served with a raw egg yolk, without any mention of tartar sauce. It has also been called \\"Tartar steak\\" in English. \\"√Ä la tartare\\" or simply \\"tartare\\" can still mean \\"served with tartar sauce\\" for some dishes, mostly fried fish.Prosper Montagn√©, Charlotte Snyder Turgeon, The new Larousse gastronomique: the encyclopedia of food, wine & cookery, 1977, p. 334 At the same time, the name \\"tartare\\" is also sometimes applied to other dishes of raw meats or fish, such as tuna tartare, introduced in 1975 by the restaurant Le Duc in Paris.Gael Greene, \\"Le Colisee Thrown to the Lions\\", New York (magazine) November 3, 1975, p. 101 == Health concerns == Health concerns have reduced the popularity of this meat dish in some parts of the world because of the danger of contamination by bacteria and parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii and Taenia saginata. ===Bacteria=== When basic hygienic rules are followed and fresh meat is used, the risk of bacterial infection is low. ===Parasites=== Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite that may be found in raw or undercooked meat. A multicentre case-control study found inadequately cooked or inadequately cured meat as the main risk factor for toxoplasma infection in all centres. Due to the risk of congenital toxoplasmosis in the fetus, pregnant women are advised not to eat raw meat. Latent toxoplasmosis in adults has been associated with, but not proven to cause, psychological effects and lower IQ in some studies. Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm) may also be acquired via ingestion of under-cooked beef. The tapeworm is transmitted to humans via infectious larval cysts that are found in cattle. People with taeniasis may not know they have a tapeworm infection, due to the fact that the symptoms are usually mild or nonexistent. But, it is still possible to develop cysticercosis. == Regional variations Europe=== Filet am√©ricain, or pr√©par√© is eaten as a spread in the Netherlands and Belgium Malgogi-yukhoe (Korean horse meat tartare) Steak tartare is found in many European cuisines. The Belgian version, filet am√©ricain (also known as pr√©par√©), is generally made with mayonnaise and seasoned with capers and fresh herbs. It was formerly made of horse meat. It is usually served with french fries.Jacques Mercier, Au coeur des mots: Les rubriques de Monsieur Dico, p. 216 In Poland, Czechia and Slovakia steak tartare (tatarsk√Ω biftek) is found in many restaurants. The meat is ground lean sirloin and has a raw egg yolk in a dimple in the middle. The meat can be premixed with herbs and spices, but usually the customer is given spices and condiments to add to taste. Steak tartare is typically served with toasted bread and raw garlic cloves for rubbing on the bread. In Poland, steak tartare is known as \\"tatar\\" or \\"befsztyk tatarski\\" and is traditionally served as an appetizer with diced onions, pickled dills, pickled mushrooms, egg yolk, spices, and, optionally, yeast extract or coriander. A variant of steak tartare is also present in Danish sm√∏rrebr√∏d, where it is served on rugbr√∏d (rye bread) with assorted toppings. In Sweden, steak tartare, r√•biff, is usually served with raw egg yolk, raw onions, diced pickled beetroot and capers. In Finland, tartarpihvi is served with raw egg yolk, raw onions, pickled and salted cucumbers and capers. Variations of the dish include dressing with buttermilk sauce and salmon roe. The (European) Russian version can include pickled and salted mushrooms and toasted white bread. ===North America=== Steak tartare is served at many trendy restaurants in the United States. In Wisconsin, a steak tartare sandwich, called a \\"cannibal sandwich\\", is popular among the descendants of German immigrants; it uses sirloin, rye bread, salt, pepper and chopped onions. ===South America=== Chilean cuisine features a dish of prepared raw beef called crudos. In southern Brazil, influenced by German immigrants, it is known as Hackepeter or Carne de On√ßa in Curitiba where this dish is very common and served covered with chives. === Africa === Ethiopians have long eaten a dish of raw, minced beef called kitfo. == In popular culture == In the British TV series Mr. Bean, In the 2nd episode, \\"The Return of Mr. Bean\\", the protagonist visits a restaurant and is served a steak tartare. After realizing it is not what he expected, he tries a variety of strategies to avoid eating it. == See also == * Basashi - Japan, horse meat * Carpaccio - Italy, beef * √áiƒü k√∂fte - Turkey * Crudos - Chile * Gored gored - Ethiopia * Hamburger - United States, beef * Kibbeh nayyeh - Levant * Kitfo - Ethiopia * Larb - Laos * List of beef dishes * List of steak dishes * Mett or hackepeter - Germany, pork * Salmon tartare * Sushi and Sashimi - Japan, seafood * Yukhoe - Korea ==References== ==Bibliography== * Linda Stradley, I'll Have What They're Having: Legendary Local Cuisine, Falcon, 2002 * * Raymond Sokolov, How to Cook, revised edition 2004, , p. 41 at Google Books * Albert Jack, What Caesar Did for My Salad: Not to Mention the Earl's Sandwich, Pavlova's Meringue and Other Curious Stories Behind Our Favourite Food, 2010, , p. 141 at Google Books ==External links== * Steak Tartare.

Disintegration in frames: aesthetics and ideology in the Yugoslav and post- Yugoslav cinema Stanford University Press, Stanford, California, page 181, ), also called drekalo, krekavac, zdrekavac or zrikavac, is a mythical creature in South Slavic mythology. The name is derived from the verb ‚Äúdreƒçati‚Äù (to screech). == Description == In South Slavic mythology and folk tales this creature has been variously described: * In some folk tales it has been depicted in the form of an undead man that came out of the grave during night time and haunt people. * Also in some folk tales it has been depicted in the form of an undead unbaptised child that rose out from its grave during night time to haunt its parents. Also this creature is known for calling out to people passing near cemeteries to baptise it. * In Eastern Serbia it has been depicted in the form of a humanoid canine creature that walks on its back legs. * In the vicinity of Maglaj it has been depicted in the form of ghosts of soldiers that wander around during night time, scaring people. * In the vicinity of Kozarska Dubica it has been depicted as a vampire-like undead man that rises out of the grave during night time, and wanders around scaring people. * In the vicinity of Arilje it has been depicted in form of a long- necked long-legged creature with a cat-like head. * In Sredaƒçka ≈æupa it has been depicted in the form of a one-legged humanoid creature with glowing eyes that wanders around during night time and scares people. * In the vicinity of Prijepolje, Le≈°ak and Dragaƒçevo it has been depicted as an apparition that can be seen in form of a dappled foal, dog, cat, or bird. * In the vicinity of Gru≈æa it has been depicted in the form of a creature having a dappled, elongated and spindle-thin body with a disproportionately large head. This creature can fly and it is believed to be the soul of a dead child. A modern description of a supposed drekavac describes it as a canine creature similar to a dog or some kind of bird. == Original beliefs == The drekavac was originally thought to have come from the souls of sinful men, or from children who died unbaptised. It was popularly believed to be visible only at night, especially during the twelve days of Christmas (called unbaptised days in Serbo-Croatian) and in early spring, when other demons and mythical creatures were believed to be more active. When assuming the form of a child, it predicts someone's death, while in its animal form, it predicts cattle disease. The drekavac is believed to avoid dogs and bright light. Also, it is believed that if the shadow of drekavac falls upon some person then that person will turn sick and die. == Modern sightings == Though the creature is used in precautionary tales for children, there are adults who still believe in its existence. According to the guide of a reporter of Duga magazine, numerous villagers on the mountain of Zlatibor report seeing it, and many inhabitants claim to have heard it. Some modern sightings happened: * In 1992, it was reported that in the Krvavica, the villagers found remains of an animal unlike any known from the area, and claimed it was a drekavac. It was described as looking like a dog, but with a \\"snake-like\\" head and hind legs \\"similar\\" to those of a kangaroo. Later, it was revealed to be just a rotten carcass of a fox; * In 2003, in the village of Tometino Polje near Divcibare, a series of attacks on sheep occurred, with some villagers concluding that they had been perpetrated by a drekavac. Other villagers disagreed, seeing as the attacks took place in the daytime, as opposed to night, when the drekavac is supposedly more active. == Appearances and references in fiction  In literature === * Drekavac is mentioned in a short story by Branko ƒÜopiƒá, \\"Brave Mita and drekavac from the pond\\" (Cyrillic: \\"–•—Ä–∞–±—Ä–∏ –ú–∏—Ç–∞ –∏ –¥—Ä–µ–∫–∞–≤–∞—Ü –∏–∑ —Ä–∏—Ç–∞\\") in which a group of superstitious fishermen stop fishing because they hear mysterious yells in the pond, where they were usually fishing, and start believing that they hear a drekavac, which leads to hunger in the village. The protagonist of the story, a courageous village boy named Mita, investigates this mystery and captures the \\"drekavac\\", which turns out to be a great bittern, a bird very rare for the area. * Drekavac is also mentioned in ƒÜopiƒá's book Eagles Fly Early. === In video games and roleplaying games === Drekavac is rarely depicted in video and roleplaying games. * In the Magic: The Gathering has a card of drekavac from the Dissension set. *In Eve Online: The Triglavian collective has named Drekavac to its Battlecruiser ship line. * Serbian trading card game \\"Izvori Magije\\" has numerous cards of drekavac type creatures, one of them named Drekavac iz vira (meaning \\"Drekavac from the whirlpool\\"). This creature is described as: Big-headed and with long thin necks, drekavac often jump out of whirlpools to attack people who are returning home from watermills. * In DmC: Devil May Cry, a demon named Drekavac appears as a recurrent enemy. It is not named as such until your final encounter with it. Rather than claws, it possesses long thin swords. == Similar mythical creatures == * Bukavac ‚Äì recorded in Syrmia, a six-legged monster with gnarled horns, slimy skin and long tail, that lives in water (rivers, swamps and creeks) and comes out of it during the night. It is known that it makes loud noises, and it will try to strangle people and animals that it encounters; * Jaud () ‚Äì a vampirised premature baby; * Myling ‚Äì from Scandinavian folklore, a phantasmal incarnations of the souls of unbaptized children that had been forced to roam the earth; * Nav ‚Äì the soul of dead child that died before its third age; * Plakavac ‚Äì recorded in Herzegovina, is a newborn strangled by its mother, which will rise from its grave at night as small vampire-like creature, return to its house and scream around it, but otherwise can't do anyharm; * Poroniec ‚Äì a hostile and malicious demon from Slavic mythology.

Although not the first or the only one to do so, he was the most influential poet to introduce Italian Renaissance verse forms, poetic techniques, and themes to Spain. He was well known in poetic circles during his lifetime, and his poetry has continued to be popular without interruption until the present. His poetry was published posthumously by Juan Bosc√°n in 1543, and it has been the subject of several annotated editions, the first and most famous of which appeared in 1574. ==Biography== Garcilaso was born in the Spanish city of Toledo between 1498 and 1503. Claver√≠a Bosc√°n affirms he was born between 1487 and 1492, and another sources affirms he was born in 1501. His father Garcilaso de la Vega, the third son of Pedro Su√°rez de Figueroa, was a nobleman and ambassador in the royal court of the Catholic Monarchs. His mother's name was Sancha de Guzm√°n. Garcilaso was the second son which meant he did not receive the mayorazgo (entitlement) to his father's estate. However, he spent his younger years receiving an extensive education, mastered five languages (Spanish, Greek, Latin, Italian and French), and learned how to play the zither, lute and the harp. When his father died in 1509, Garcilaso received a sizeable inheritance. Cover of The works of Bosc√°n and Garcilaso de la Vega in 4 books, 1543 After his schooling, he joined the military in hopes of joining the royal guard. He was named \\"contino\\" (imperial guard) of Charles V in 1520, and he was made a member of the Order of Santiago in 1523. There were a few women in the life of this poet. His first lover was Guiomar Carrillo, with whom he had a child. He had another suspected lover named Isabel Freire, who was a lady-in-waiting of Isabel of Portugal, but this is today regarded as mythical. In 1525, Garcilaso married Elena de Z√∫√±iga, who served as a lady-in-waiting for the King's favorite sister, Leonor. Their marriage took place in Garcilaso's hometown of Toledo in one of the family's estates. He had six children: Lorenzo, an illegitimate child with Guiomar Carrillo, Garcilaso, √ç√±igo de Z√∫√±iga, Pedro de Guzm√°n, Sancha, and Francisco. Garcilaso's military career meant that he took part in the numerous battles and campaigns conducted by Charles V across Europe. His duties took him to Italy, Germany, Tunisia and France. In 1532 for a short period he was exiled to a Danube island where he was the guest of the Count Gy√∂rgy Cseszneky, royal court judge of Gy≈ër. Later in France, he would fight his last battle. The King desired to take control of Marseille and eventually control of the Mediterranean Sea, but this goal was never realized. Garcilaso de la Vega died on 14 October 1536 in Nice, after suffering 25 days from an injury sustained in a battle at Le Muy. His body was first buried in the Church of St. Dominic in Nice, but two years later his wife had his body moved to the Church of San Pedro Martir in Toledo. ==Works== Garcilaso de la Vega is best known for his tragic love poetry that contrasts the playful poetry of his predecessors. He seemed to progress through three distinct episodes of his life which are reflected in his works. During his Spanish period, he wrote the majority of his eight-syllable poems; during his Italian or Petrarchan period, he wrote mostly sonnets and songs; and during his Neapolitan or classicist period, he wrote his other more classical poems, including his elegies, letters, eclogues and odes. Influenced by many Italian Renaissance poets, Garcilaso adapted the eleven-syllable line to the Spanish language in his sonetos (sonnets), mostly written in the 1520s, during his Petrarchan period. Increasing the number of syllables in the verse from eight to eleven allowed for greater flexibility. In addition to the sonetos, Garcilaso helped to introduce several other types of stanzas to the Spanish language. These include the estancia, formed by eleven- and seven-syllable lines; the \\"lira\\", formed by three seven-syllable and two eleven-syllable lines; and endecas√≠labos sueltos, formed by unrhymed eleven-syllable lines. Dramatized lecture of Garcilaso's Apollo and Daphne Throughout his life, Garcilaso de la Vega wrote various poems in each of these types. His works include: forty Sonetos (Sonnets), five Canciones (Songs), eight Coplas (Couplets), three √âglogas (Eclogues), two Eleg√≠as (Elegies), and the Ep√≠stola a Bosc√°n (Letter to Bosc√°n). Allusions to classical myths and Greco-Latin figures, great musicality, alliteration, rhythm and an absence of religion characterize his poetry. It can be said that Spanish poetry was never the same after Garcilaso de la Vega. His works have influenced the majority of subsequent Spanish poets, including other major authors of the period like Jorge de Montemor, Luis de Le√≥n, John of the Cross, Miguel de Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Luis de G√≥ngora and Francisco Quevedo. For example: (√©gloga Tercera): ::::M√°s a las veces son mejor o√≠dos ::::el puro ingenio y lengua casi muda, ::::testigos limpios de √°nimo inocente, ::::que la curiosidad del elocuente. He was very good at transmitting the sense of life into writing, in many poems including his ¬´dolorido sentir¬ª: ::::No me podr√°n quitar el dolorido ::::sentir, si ya del todo ::::primero no me quitan el sentido. We see the shift in traditional belief of Heaven as influenced by the Renaissance, which is called \\"neo-Platonism,\\" which tried to lift love to a spiritual, idealistic plane, as compared to the traditional Catholic view of Heaven. (√âgloga primera): ::::Contigo mano a mano ::::busquemos otros prados y otros r√≠os, ::::otros valles floridos y sombr√≠os, ::::donde descanse, y siempre pueda verte ::::ante los ojos m√≠os, ::::sin miedo y sobresalto de perderte. (√âgloga primera) He has enjoyed a revival of influence among 21st century pastoral poets such as Seamus Heaney, Dennis Nurkse, and Giannina Braschi. ==Literary references== Monument to Garcilaso in Toledo, Spain Garcilaso is mentioned in multiple works by Miguel de Cervantes. In the second volume of Don Quixote, the protagonist quotes one of the poet's sonnets. In El licenciado Vidriera, Tom√°s Rodaja carries a volume of Garcilaso on his journey across Europe. The title of Pedro Salinas's sequence of poems La voz a ti debida is taken from Garcilaso's third eclogue. In the novel Of Love and Other Demons by Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, one of the main characters, Father Cayetano Delaura, is an admirer of Garcilaso de la Vega. In the novel, which takes place in 18th- century colonial Colombia, Delaura is forced to give up being a priest because of his tragic love affair. Puerto Rican poet Giannina Braschi wrote both a poetic treatise on Garcilaso de la Vega's Eclogues, as well as a book of poems in homage to the Spanish master, entitled Empire of Dreams. ==Modern translations== * The Odes and Sonnets of Garcilaso de la Vega, trans James Cleugh, (London: Aquila, 1930) == Further reading == * Creel, Bryant. \\"Garcilaso de la Vega\\".

Schempp which declared that required public school sanctioned Bible readings were unconstitutional. ==Biography== Schempp was born in Philadelphia and grew up in the Roslyn community of Abington Township. He graduated from Abington High School in 1958, and attended Tufts University where he earned bachelor degrees in physics and geology. In 1967, Schempp received his Ph.D. in physics from Brown University. In 1977, Schempp was part of the Pittsburgh Explorer‚Äôs Group Nanga Parbat Expedition which was to be the first American group to reach the peak of Nanga Parbat in Pakistan. Schempp, who is retired, currently resides in Boston, Massachusetts. Stephen D. Solomon, a professor at New York University, has written a book about Schempp and the Supreme Court case entitled Ellery‚Äôs Protest: How One Young Man Defied Tradition and Sparked the Battle over School Prayer. ==Activism== On November 26, 1956, Schempp staged a protest against the school requirement that each student read 10 Bible passages and the Lord's Prayer each day during homeroom. That day he brought a copy of the Qur'an and read from it; for this he was sent to the Principal's office. With the help of his father, Edward Schempp, and the American Civil Liberties Union, they sued the Abington School district over their policy of mandatory Bible readings. To maintain standing in the case, Schempp (and later his younger siblings Roger and Donna) continued to fight this policy in the courts over several years. The Schempps were Unitarian Universalists, a theologically liberal religious community. The case was eventually decided in Schempps's favor by the Supreme Court in 1963, five years after he had graduated from high school. The precedent that this decision established, that the public school does not have the right to sponsor religious exercises and then pressure students to take part in them has appeared time and time again in every church-state case focusing on religion in public schools. Schempp considers himself to be an atheist but supports the Unitarian Universalist organizations and is a strong supporter of the ACLU and of the separation of church and state. He is a popular speaker at Unitarian Universalist and secular humanist meetings, where he speaks about his landmark protest as well as the current state of democracy, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. Schempp is a member of the American Humanist Association and Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. In 1996, he received the Religious Liberty Award from Americans United. He is on the Advisory Board of the Secular Student Alliance and the Secular Coalition for America. He has traveled throughout the country talking about his experiences. In 2002, Schempp was elected to Abington Senior High School's hall of fame for his accomplishments in physics. His involvement in the court case was not mentioned in his acceptance speech except that he opened with the line, \\"I never thought they'd invite me back here.\\"\\"Dr. Ellery Schempp ‚Äì A Humanist You Should Know,\\" iHumanism, 17 June 2013. The award did include the notation ‚ÄúInitiated school prayer suit against Abington which was eventually decided by U.S. Supreme Court in 1963.‚Äù ==Physics== Schempp's doctoral thesis was entitled Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance in Nitrogen Heterocycles. This work was the precursor to the development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on which he continued to work for a substantial portion of his career. ==References== ==External links== * OYEZ.Org: Abington School District v.

It was serialized in many different Japanese magazines, including Monthly Sh≈çnen King, Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine, Sh≈çnen Big Comic, COM, Sh≈çjo Comic, Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday, Monthly Sh≈çnen Jump, and Monthly Comic Nora. In 2012, comiXology acquired the digital distribution rights to Shotaro Ishinomori's catalogue, including Cyborg 009. ==Plot== Nine people from around the world are kidnapped by the evil Black Ghost organization, led by its tyrannical leader Skull, to undergo experiments that would allow him to use them as human weapons to promote the production of cyborg warfare. While he succeeds in converting the group of nine into cyborgs with superhuman powers, his most reputable scientist, Dr. Isaac Gilmore, helps the cyborgs escape to rebel against Skull and his organization. The nine cyborgs (from which the name of the series is derived) band together in order to stop Black Ghost from achieving its goal of starting the next world war by supplying rich buyers with countless weapons of mass destruction. After the destruction of Black Ghost, the nine cyborgs go on to fight a variety of threats such as mad scientists, supernatural beings, and ancient civilizations. ==Characters== ==MediaManga=== The first arc was serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen King (Sh≈çnen Gahosha). It depicts Cyborg 009's origin story, the escape from Black Ghost, and the group running from the cyborg assassins. It ended with the battle against the Mythos Cyborgs. The second arc, called The Underground Empire Yomi Arc, appeared in Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine (Kodansha) alongside the release of the film version. The story is highly influenced by Edgar Rice Burroughs' Earth's Core series, including an expedition to the center of the Earth with a drill tank and a reptile race who can use telepathy and grow wings. The story ends with the final battle against Black Ghost. In the final scene, 009 and 002 fall into Earth's atmosphere and are seen as a shooting star by two small children, one of whom wishes for a toy gun and the other for world peace (a scene reminiscent of Ray Bradbury's Kaleidoscope). As such, 001 was able to use his telekinetic powers at the last minute to retrieve 002 and 009 from their plummet before death. The third arc, serialized in Monthly Bouken-oh (Adventure King) (Akita Shoten), contained 6 story arcs, including the Monster Island Arc, the Middle East Arc, and the Angels Arc. The series abruptly ended during the Angels Arc. The fourth arc, called The Battle of the Gods Arc, was serialized in COM (Mushi Production). Ishinomori resumed and retold the interrupted Angels Arc with a new plot, but the series once again ended abruptly. Ishinomori would not resume the series for a few years after this. The fifth arc was serialized in Sh≈çjo Comic (Shogakukan), and included the Wind City Arc, the Snow Carnival Arc, and the Edda Arc. The story deals with legendary and mythical like characters challenging the 00 Number Cyborgs. The sixth arc followed closely after the fifth arc. Arcs such as the Deinonychus Arc (appeared in Monthly Sh≈çnen Jump (Shueisha)) and Green Hole Arc (appeared in Play Comic (Akita Shoten)) were depicted, then long after, the Underwater Pyramid Arc was serialized in Monthly Manga Sh≈çnen (Asahi Sonorama). The seventh arc was serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday (Shogakukan) alongside the revival anime. A long arc consisting of many short arcs, this series dealt with the battle against Neo Black Ghost as well as the emotional trauma of the 00 Number Cyborgs. The story is set approximately 20 years after the Yomi Arc, and the personalities and conduct of the cyborgs are depicted as more adult. The eighth arc was serialized in Monthly Comic Nora (Gakken). This longer arc was called People Drifting Through Time and Space Arc, and is a sequel to the Immigration Arc. The Count of St. Germain from the Underwater Pyramid Arc appears, but the design of his drawing is different. Manga publication history The series was written and illustrated by Shotaro Ishinomori, serialized in Monthly Sh≈çnen King, published in Japan by Akita Shoten and other companies through its history, and published in North America by Tokyopop. Digital comics distributor comiXology licensed the entire catalogue from Ishimori Productions in 2012, and has made the first 10 volumes of Cyborg 009 available to the public.

All of the 50 episodes from the 1979 version were released in Sweden with a Swedish dub in a total of 25 VHS tapes between 1986 - 1989. All of the voices were done by the Danish actor Timm Mehrens. The 2001 version aired on MBC 3 several times starting from 2005 and became extremely popular with Arab viewers. It also aired on Cartoon Network Australia's Toonami Block in 2002 ===North American releases=== The 1967 movie was released in Mexico, and years later, the 2001 television series aired on Toonami in 2003. The movie was later replayed on Cadena Tres in 2007, and was quite popular with Mexican viewers. The 1979 series was broadcast with English subtitles on Japanese-language television in Hawaii, California, and in the New York metropolitan area. The English subtitles were produced by San Francisco-based Fuji Television, which did not broadcast the series as part of its Japanese programming on KEMO-TV. The 1980 film was released in the United States in 1988 by Celebrity Home Entertainment as Defenders of the Vortex, with an edited version of an English dub that was commissioned through the Tokyo, Japan-based Frontier Enterprises. It later received an unedited direct-to-video English release in 1995 by Best Film and Video Corporation with the full version of the same dub. The 2001 TV series was licensed by Avex Inc. (the North American branch of Avex Mode, the 2001 series' original distributor in Japan) and dubbed into English by Animaze and ZRO Limit Productions. The entire series was dubbed, with the first 26 episodes shown on the Toonami programming block on Cartoon Network, while episodes 27 to 47 were shown on Cartoon Network's late Friday night \\"Graveyard Shift\\" block, right before the show was dropped from their line-up. The first 8 episodes were distributed on DVD by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment in a two-disc uncut bilingual set, as well as two dub-only edited broadcast volumes of four episodes each along with Portuguese and Spanish dubs. As of 2017, none of the other episodes have become available on home video outside Japan and Hong Kong, but Madman Entertainment released the first 26 dubbed episodes to DVD in Australia; they are since out of print. Discotek Media announced during their Otakon 2017 panel that they have licensed the 2001 series, and they will release the entire series, in the uncut bilingual version, on a SDBD set. The purpose for this set is to restore the uncut version of the dub for the whole series to its best state possible, as well as the video quality. The uncut dub master tapes were damaged upon arrival, due to the age of the DA-88 tapes. The set has an 11-page essay about the restoration process by the company's producer and Anime News Network founder Justin Sevakis, along with an 83-page art gallery. The set was also the North American and dub premiere of the three-episode God's War finale. The set was officially released on June 25, 2019. The 2012 movie is licensed by Funimation in North America, Anime Limited in the UK, and Madman Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand. An English dub was produced by NYAV Post, and a theatrical release was released in all three territories. ==References== ==External links== * *SPTI's Anime & Animation Brochure: Cyborg 009 *„Çµ„Ç§„Éú„Éº„Ç∞ÔºêÔºêÔºô Asahi Shimbun, 15 July 2008 *009 Re:Cyborg Movie * Category:1964 manga Category:1966 anime films Category:1967 anime films Category:1968 anime television series Category:1979 anime television series Category:1993 video games Category:1994 video games Category:2001 anime television series Category:2002 video games Category:Akita Shoten manga Category:Asahi Sonorama manga Category:Brain's Base Category:Cyborgs in anime and manga Category:Discotek Media Category:Fictional cyborgs Category:Kodansha manga Category:Manga adapted into films Category:Media Factory manga Category:OLM, Inc.

An eyepiece, or ocular lens, is a type of lens that is attached to a variety of optical devices such as telescopes and microscopes. It is so named because it is usually the lens that is closest to the eye when someone looks through the device. The objective lens or mirror collects light and brings it to focus creating an image. The eyepiece is placed near the focal point of the objective to magnify this image. The amount of magnification depends on the focal length of the eyepiece. An eyepiece consists of several \\"lens elements\\" in a housing, with a \\"barrel\\" on one end. The barrel is shaped to fit in a special opening of the instrument to which it is attached. The image can be focused by moving the eyepiece nearer and further from the objective. Most instruments have a focusing mechanism to allow movement of the shaft in which the eyepiece is mounted, without needing to manipulate the eyepiece directly. The eyepieces of binoculars are usually permanently mounted in the binoculars, causing them to have a pre-determined magnification and field of view. With telescopes and microscopes, however, eyepieces are usually interchangeable. By switching the eyepiece, the user can adjust what is viewed. For instance, eyepieces will often be interchanged to increase or decrease the magnification of a telescope. Eyepieces also offer varying fields of view, and differing degrees of eye relief for the person who looks through them. == Eyepiece properties == A 25 mm Kellner eyepiece Several properties of an eyepiece are likely to be of interest to a user of an optical instrument, when comparing eyepieces and deciding which eyepiece suits their needs. === Design distance to entrance pupil === Eyepieces are optical systems where the entrance pupil is invariably located outside of the system. They must be designed for optimal performance for a specific distance to this entrance pupil (i.e. with minimum aberrations for this distance). In a refracting astronomical telescope the entrance pupil is identical with the objective. This may be several feet distant from the eyepiece; whereas with a microscope eyepiece the entrance pupil is close to the back focal plane of the objective, mere inches from the eyepiece. Microscope eyepieces may be corrected differently from telescope eyepieces; however, most are also suitable for telescope use. === Elements and groups === Elements are the individual lenses, which may come as simple lenses or \\"singlets\\" and cemented doublets or (rarely) triplets. When lenses are cemented together in pairs or triples, the combined elements are called groups (of lenses). The first eyepieces had only a single lens element, which delivered highly distorted images. Two and three-element designs were invented soon after, and quickly became standard due to the improved image quality. Today, engineers assisted by computer-aided drafting software have designed eyepieces with seven or eight elements that deliver exceptionally large, sharp views. === Internal reflection and scatter === Internal reflections, sometimes called \\"scatter\\", cause the light passing through an eyepiece to disperse and reduce the contrast of the image projected by the eyepiece. When the effect is particularly bad, \\"ghost images\\" are seen, called \\"ghosting\\". For many years, simple eyepiece designs with a minimum number of internal air-to-glass surfaces were preferred to avoid this problem. One solution to scatter is to use thin film coatings over the surface of the element. These thin coatings are only one or two wavelengths deep, and work to reduce reflections and scattering by changing the refraction of the light passing through the element. Some coatings may also absorb light that is not being passed through the lens in a process called total internal reflection where the light incident on the film is at a shallow angle. ===Chromatic aberration === Lateral or transverse chromatic aberration is caused because the refraction at glass surfaces differs for light of different wavelengths. Blue light, seen through an eyepiece element, will not focus to the same point but along the same axis as red light. The effect can create a ring of false colour around point sources of light and results in a general blurriness to the image. One solution is to reduce the aberration by using multiple elements of different types of glass. Achromats are lens groups that bring two different wavelengths of light to the same focus and exhibit greatly reduced false colour. Low dispersion glass may also be used to reduce chromatic aberration. Longitudinal chromatic aberration is a pronounced effect of optical telescope objectives, because the focal lengths are so long. Microscopes, whose focal lengths are generally shorter, do not tend to suffer from this effect. === Focal length === The focal length of an eyepiece is the distance from the principal plane of the eyepiece where parallel rays of light converge to a single point. When in use, the focal length of an eyepiece, combined with the focal length of the telescope or microscope objective, to which it is attached, determines the magnification. It is usually expressed in millimetres when referring to the eyepiece alone. When interchanging a set of eyepieces on a single instrument, however, some users prefer to refer to identify each eyepiece by the magnification produced. For a telescope, the angular magnification MA produced by the combination of a particular eyepiece and objective can be calculated with the following formula: :\\\\mathrm{MA}= \\\\frac{f_O}{f_E} where: * f_O is the focal length of the objective, * f_E is the focal length of the eyepiece. Magnification increases, therefore, when the focal length of the eyepiece is shorter or the focal length of the objective is longer. For example, a 25 mm eyepiece in a telescope with a 1200 mm focal length would magnify objects 48 times. A 4 mm eyepiece in the same telescope would magnify 300 times. Amateur astronomers tend to refer to telescope eyepieces by their focal length in millimetres. These typically range from about 3 mm to 50 mm. Some astronomers, however, prefer to specify the resulting magnification power rather than the focal length. It is often more convenient to express magnification in observation reports, as it gives a more immediate impression of what view the observer actually saw. Due to its dependence on properties of the particular telescope in use, however, magnification power alone is meaningless for describing a telescope eyepiece. For a compound microscope the corresponding formula is :\\\\mathrm{MA}= \\\\frac{ D D_{\\\\mathrm{EO} }}{f_O f_E} = \\\\frac{D}{f_E} \\\\times \\\\frac{ D_{\\\\mathrm{EO}}}{f_O} where * D is the distance of closest distinct vision (usually 250 mm) * D_\\\\mathrm{EO} is the distance between the back focal plane of the objective and the back focal plane of the eyepiece (called tube length), typically 160 mm for a modern instrument. * f_O is the objective focal length and f_E is the eyepiece focal length. By convention, microscope eyepieces are usually specified by power instead of focal length. Microscope eyepiece power P_\\\\mathrm{E} and objective power P_\\\\mathrm{O} are defined by : P_\\\\mathrm{E} = \\\\frac{D}{f_E}, \\\\qquad P_\\\\mathrm{O} = \\\\frac{D_{\\\\mathrm{EO}}}{f_O} thus from the expression given earlier for the angular magnification of a compound microscope : \\\\mathrm{MA} = P_\\\\mathrm{E} \\\\times P_\\\\mathrm{O} The total angular magnification of a microscope image is then simply calculated by multiplying the eyepiece power by the objective power. For example, a 10√ó eyepiece with a 40√ó objective will magnify the image 400 times. This definition of lens power relies upon an arbitrary decision to split the angular magnification of the instrument into separate factors for the eyepiece and the objective. Historically, Abbe described microscope eyepieces differently, in terms of angular magnification of the eyepiece and 'initial magnification' of the objective. While convenient for the optical designer, this turned out to be less convenient from the viewpoint of practical microscopy and was thus subsequently abandoned. The generally accepted visual distance of closest focus D is 250 mm, and eyepiece power is normally specified assuming this value. Common eyepiece powers are 8√ó, 10√ó, 15√ó, and 20√ó. The focal length of the eyepiece (in mm) can thus be determined if required by dividing 250 mm by the eyepiece power. Modern instruments often use objectives optically corrected for an infinite tube length rather than 160 mm, and these require an auxiliary correction lens in the tube. === Location of focal plane === In some eyepiece types, such as Ramsden eyepieces (described in more detail below), the eyepiece behaves as a magnifier, and its focal plane is located outside of the eyepiece in front of the field lens. This plane is therefore accessible as a location for a graticule or micrometer crosswires. In the Huygenian eyepiece, the focal plane is located between the eye and field lenses, inside the eyepiece, and is hence not accessible. === Field of view === Simulation of views through a telescope using different eyepieces. The center image uses an eyepiece of the same focal length as the one on the left, but has a wider apparent field of view giving a larger image that shows more area. The image on the right also has a shorter focal length, giving the same true field of view as the left image but at higher magnification. The Pl√∂ssl, an eyepiece with a large apparent field of view The field of view, often abbreviated FOV, describes the area of a target (measured as an angle from the location of viewing) that can be seen when looking through an eyepiece. The field of view seen through an eyepiece varies, depending on the magnification achieved when connected to a particular telescope or microscope, and also on properties of the eyepiece itself. Eyepieces are differentiated by their field stop, which is the narrowest aperture that light entering the eyepiece must pass through to reach the field lens of the eyepiece. Due to the effects of these variables, the term \\"field of view\\" nearly always refers to one of two meanings: ;Actual field of view:The angular size of the amount of sky that can be seen through an eyepiece when used with a particular telescope, producing a specific magnification. It ranges typically between 0.1 and 2 degrees. ;Apparent field of view:This is a measure of the angular size of the image viewed through the eyepiece. In other words, it is how large the image appears (as distinct from the magnification). This is constant for any given eyepiece of fixed focal length, and may be used to calculate what the actual field of view will be when the eyepiece is used with a given telescope. The measurement ranges from 30 to 110 degrees. It is common for users of an eyepiece to want to calculate the actual field of view, because it indicates how much of the sky will be visible when the eyepiece is used with their telescope. The most convenient method of calculating the actual field of view depends on whether the apparent field of view is known. If the apparent field of view is known, the actual field of view can be calculated from the following approximate formula: :FOV_C= \\\\frac{FOV_P}{mag} ::or :FOV_C= \\\\frac{FOV_P}{(\\\\frac{f_T}{f_E})} where: * FOV_C is the actual field of view, calculated in the unit of angular measurement in which FOV_P is provided. * FOV_P is the apparent field of view. * mag is the magnification. * f_T is the focal length of the telescope. * f_E is the focal length of the eyepiece, expressed in the same units of measurement as f_T. The focal length of the telescope objective is the diameter of the objective times the focal ratio. It represents the distance at which the mirror or objective lens will cause light to converge on a single point. The formula is accurate to 4% or better up to 40¬∞ apparent field of view, and has a 10% error for 60¬∞. If the apparent field of view is unknown, the actual field of view can be approximately found using: :FOV_C= \\\\frac{57.3d}{f_T} where: * FOV_C is the actual field of view, calculated in degrees. * d is the diameter of the eyepiece field stop in mm. * f_T is the focal length of the telescope, in mm. The second formula is actually more accurate, but field stop size is not usually specified by most manufacturers. The first formula will not be accurate if the field is not flat, or is higher than 60¬∞ which is common for most ultra-wide eyepiece design. The above formulae are approximations. The ISO 14132-1:2002 standard determines how the exact apparent angle of view (AAOV) is calculated from the real angle of view (AOV). :tan\\\\frac{AAOV}{2}= mag \\\\times tan \\\\frac{AOV}{2} If a diagonal or Barlow lens is used before the eyepiece, the eyepiece's field of view may be slightly restricted. This occurs when the preceding lens has a narrower field stop than the eyepiece's, causing the obstruction in the front to act as a smaller field stop in front of the eyepiece. The precise relationship is given by :{AAOV}=2 \\\\times arctan \\\\frac{0.5d}{f_E} This formula also indicates that, for an eyepiece design with a given apparent field of view, the barrel diameter will determine the maximum focal length possible for that eyepiece, as no field stop can be larger than the barrel itself. For example, a Pl√∂ssl with 45¬∞ apparent field of view in a 1.25 inch barrel would yield a maximum focal length of 35mm. Anything longer requires larger barrel or the view is restricted by the edge, effectively making the field of view less than 45¬∞. === Barrel diameter === Eyepieces for telescopes and microscopes are usually interchanged to increase or decrease the magnification, and to enable the user to select a type with certain performance characteristics. To allow this, eyepieces come in standardized \\"Barrel diameters\\". Telescope eyepieces Examples (from left to right) of 2\\" (51 mm), 1.25\\" (32 mm), and 0.965\\" (24.5 mm) eyepieces. There are six standard barrel diameters for telescopes. The barrel sizes (usually expressed in inches) are: * 0.965 in. (24.5 mm) ‚Äì This is the smallest standard barrel diameter and is usually found in toy store and shopping mall retail telescopes. Many of these eyepieces that come with such telescopes are plastic, and some even have plastic lenses. High-end telescope eyepieces with this barrel size are no longer manufactured, but you can still purchase Kellner types. * 1.25 in. (31.75 mm) ‚Äì This is the most popular telescope eyepiece barrel diameter. The practical upper limit on focal lengths for eyepieces with 1.25\\" barrels is about 32 mm. With longer focal lengths, the edges of the barrel itself intrude into the view limiting its size. With focal lengths longer than 32 mm, the available field of view falls below 50¬∞, which most amateurs consider to be the minimum acceptable width. These barrel sizes are threaded to take 30 mm filters. * 2 in. (50.8 mm) ‚Äì The larger barrel size in 2\\" eyepieces helps alleviate the limit on focal lengths. The upper limit of focal length with 2\\" eyepieces is about 55 mm. The trade-off is that these eyepieces are usually more expensive, will not fit in some telescopes, and may be heavy enough to tip the telescope. These barrel sizes are threaded to take 48 mm filters (or rarely 49 mm). * 2.7 in. (68.58 mm) ‚Äì 2.7\\" eyepieces are made by a few manufacturers. They allow for slightly larger fields of view. Many high-end focusers now accept these eyepieces. * 3 in. (76.2 mm) ‚Äì The even larger barrel size in 3\\" eyepieces allows for extreme focal lengths and over 120¬∞ field of view eyepieces. The disadvantages are that these eyepieces are somewhat rare, extremely expensive, up to 5 lbs in weight, and that only a few telescopes have focusers large enough to accept them. Their huge weight causes balancing issues in Schmidt-Cassegrains under 10 inches, refractors under 5 inches, and reflectors under 16 inches. Also, due to their large field stops, without larger secondary mirrors most reflectors and Schmidt-Cassegrains will have severe vignetting with these eyepieces. Makers of these eyepieces include Explore Scientific and Siebert Optics. Telescopes that can accept these eyepieces are made by Explore Scientific and Orion Telescopes and Binoculars. * 4 in. (102 mm) ‚Äì These eyepieces are rare and only commonly used in observatories. They are made by very few manufacturers, and demand for them is low. Microscope eyepieces Eyepieces for microscopes have barrel diameters measured in millimeters such as 23.2 mm and 30 mm. === Eye relief === The eye relief. 1 Real image 2 - Field diaphragm 3 - Eye relief 4 - Exit pupil The eye needs to be held at a certain distance behind the eye lens of an eyepiece to see images properly through it. This distance is called the eye relief. A larger eye relief means that the optimum position is farther from the eyepiece, making it easier to view an image. However, if the eye relief is too large it can be uncomfortable to hold the eye in the correct position for an extended period of time, for which reason some eyepieces with long eye relief have cups behind the eye lens to aid the observer in maintaining the correct observing position. The eye pupil should coincide with the exit pupil, the image of the entrance pupil, which in the case of an astronomical telescope corresponds to the object glass. Eye relief typically ranges from about 2 mm to 20 mm, depending on the construction of the eyepiece. Long focal-length eyepieces usually have ample eye relief, but short focal-length eyepieces are more problematic. Until recently, and still quite commonly, eyepieces of a short- focal length have had a short eye relief. Good design guidelines suggest a minimum of 5‚Äì6 mm to accommodate the eyelashes of the observer to avoid discomfort. Modern designs with many lens elements, however, can correct for this, and viewing at high power becomes more comfortable. This is especially the case for spectacle wearers, who may need up to 20 mm of eye relief to accommodate their glasses. == Eyepiece designs == Technology has developed over time and there are a variety of eyepiece designs for use with telescopes, microscopes, gun-sights, and other devices. Some of these designs are described in more detail below. ===Negative lens or \\"Galilean\\"=== Negative lens The simple negative lens placed before the focus of the objective has the advantage of presenting an erect image but with limited field of view better suited to low magnification. It is suspected this type of lens was used in some of the first refracting telescopes that appeared in the Netherlands in about 1608. It was also used in Galileo Galilei's 1609 telescope design which gave this type of eyepiece arrangement the name \\"Galilean\\". This type of eyepiece is still used in very cheap telescopes, binoculars and in opera glasses. ===Convex lens=== Convex lens A simple convex lens placed after the focus of the objective lens presents the viewer with a magnified inverted image. This configuration may have been used in the first refracting telescopes from the Netherlands and was proposed as a way to have a much wider field of view and higher magnification in telescopes in Johannes Kepler's 1611 book Dioptrice. Since the lens is placed after the focal plane of the objective it also allowed for use of a micrometer at the focal plane (used for determining the angular size and/or distance between objects observed). === Huygens === Huygens eyepiece diagram Huygens eyepieces consist of two plano- convex lenses with the plane sides towards the eye separated by an air gap. The lenses are called the eye lens and the field lens. The focal plane is located between the two lenses. It was invented by Christiaan Huygens in the late 1660s and was the first compound (multi-lens) eyepiece.Philip S. Harrington, \\"Star Ware\\", page 181 Huygens discovered that two air spaced lenses can be used to make an eyepiece with zero transverse chromatic aberration. If the lenses are made of glass of the same Abbe number, to be used with a relaxed eye and a telescope with an infinitely distant objective then the separation is given by: : d= \\\\frac{1}{2} (f_A + f_B) where f_A and f_B are the focal lengths of the component lenses. These eyepieces work well with the very long focal length telescopes (in Huygens day they were used with single element long focal length non-achromatic refracting telescopes, including very long focal length aerial telescopes). This optical design is now considered obsolete since with today's shorter focal length telescopes the eyepiece suffers from short eye relief, high image distortion, chromatic aberration, and a very narrow apparent field of view. Since these eyepieces are cheap to make they can often be found on inexpensive telescopes and microscopes. Because Huygens eyepieces do not contain cement to hold the lens elements, telescope users sometimes use these eyepieces in the role of \\"solar projection\\", i.e. projecting an image of the Sun onto a screen for prolonged periods of time. Cemented eyepieces are traditionally regarded as potentially vulnerable to heat damage by the intense concentrations of light involved. ===Ramsden=== Ramsden eyepiece diagram The Ramsden eyepiece comprises two plano-convex lenses of the same glass and similar focal lengths, placed less than one eye-lens focal length apart, a design created by astronomical and scientific instrument maker Jesse Ramsden in 1782. The lens separation varies between different designs, but is typically somewhere between 7/10 and 7/8 of the focal length of the eye-lens, the choice being a trade off between residual transverse chromatic aberration (at low values) and at high values running the risk of the field lens touching the focal plane when used by an observer who works with a close virtual image such as a myopic observer, or a young person whose accommodation is able to cope with a close virtual image (this is a serious problem when used with a micrometer as it can result in damage to the instrument). A separation of exactly 1 focal length is also inadvisable since it renders the dust on the field lens disturbingly in focus. The two curved surfaces face inwards. The focal plane is thus located outside of the eyepiece and is hence accessible as a location where a graticule, or micrometer crosshairs may be placed. Because a separation of exactly one focal length would be required to correct transverse chromatic aberration, it is not possible to correct the Ramsden design completely for transverse chromatic aberration. The design is slightly better than Huygens but still not up to today‚Äôs standards. It remains highly suitable for use with instruments operating using near-monochromatic light sources e.g. polarimeters. === Kellner or \\"Achromat\\" === Kellner eyepiece diagram In a Kellner eyepiece an achromatic doublet is used in place of the simple plano-convex eye lens in the Ramsden design to correct the residual transverse chromatic aberration. Carl Kellner designed this first modern achromatic eyepiece in 1849, also called an \\"achromatized Ramsden\\". Kellner eyepieces are a 3-lens design. They are inexpensive and have fairly good image from low to medium power and are far superior to Huygenian or Ramsden design. The eye relief is better than the Huygenian and worse than the Ramsden eyepieces.\\"Military handbook MIL- HDBK-141\\", chapter 14 The biggest problem of Kellner eyepieces was internal reflections. Today's anti-reflection coatings make these usable, economical choices for small to medium aperture telescopes with focal ratio f/6 or longer. The typical apparent field of view is 40‚Äì50¬∞. ===Pl√∂ssl or \\"Symmetrical\\"=== Pl√∂ssl eyepiece diagram The Pl√∂ssl is an eyepiece usually consisting of two sets of doublets, designed by Georg Simon Pl√∂ssl in 1860. Since the two doublets can be identical this design is sometimes called a symmetrical eyepiece.Steven R. Coe, Nebulae and how to observe them, p. 9. The compound Pl√∂ssl lens provides a large 50¬∞ or more apparent field of view, along with relatively large FOV. This makes this eyepiece ideal for a variety of observational purposes including deep-sky and planetary viewing. The chief disadvantage of the Pl√∂ssl optical design is short eye relief compared to an orthoscopic since the Pl√∂ssl eye relief is restricted to about 70‚Äì80% of focal length. The short eye relief is more critical in short focal lengths below about 10 mm, when viewing can become uncomfortable especially for people wearing glasses. The Pl√∂ssl eyepiece was an obscure design until the 1980s when astronomical equipment manufacturers started selling redesigned versions of it.Philip S. Harrington, Star Ware: The Amateur Astronomer's Guide, page 183 Today it is a very popular design on the amateur astronomical market, where the name Pl√∂ssl covers a range of eyepieces with at least four optical elements. This eyepiece is one of the more expensive to manufacture because of the quality of glass, and the need for well matched convex and concave lenses to prevent internal reflections. Due to this fact, the quality of different Pl√∂ssl eyepieces varies. There are notable differences between cheap Pl√∂ssls with simplest anti-reflection coatings and well made ones. === Orthoscopic or \\"Abbe\\" === Orthoscopic eyepiece diagram The 4-element orthographic eyepiece consists of a plano-convex singlet eye lens and a cemented convex-convex triplet field lens achromatic field lens. This gives the eyepiece a nearly perfect image quality and good eye relief, but a narrow apparent field of view ‚Äî about 40¬∞‚Äì45¬∞. It was invented by Ernst Abbe in 1880. It is called \\"orthoscopic\\" or \\"orthographic\\" because of its low degree of distortion and is also sometimes called an \\"ortho\\" or \\"Abbe\\". Until the advent of multicoatings and the popularity of the Pl√∂ssl, orthoscopics were the most popular design for telescope eyepieces. Even today these eyepieces are considered good eyepieces for planetary and lunar viewing. Due to their low degree of distortion and the corresponding globe effect, they are less suitable for applications which require an excessive panning of the instrument. === Monocentric === Monocentric eyepiece diagram A Monocentric is an achromatic triplet lens with two pieces of crown glass cemented on both sides of a flint glass element. The elements are thick, strongly curved, and their surfaces have a common center giving it the name \\"monocentric\\". It was invented by Hugo Adolf Steinheil around 1883. This design, like the solid eyepiece designs of Robert Tolles, Charles S. Hastings, and E. Wilfred Taylor,Handbook of Optical Systems, Survey of Optical Instruments by Herbert Gross, Hannfried Z√ºgge, Fritz Blechinger, Bertram Achtner, page 110 is free from ghost reflections and gives a bright contrasty image, a desirable feature when it was invented (before anti-reflective coatings). \\"Demystifying Multicoatings\\" by Rodger Gordon (Originally appeared in TPO Volume 8, Issue 4. 1997) It has a narrow field of view of around 25¬∞ and is a favorite amongst planetary observers. === Erfle === Erfle eyepiece diagram An erfle is a 5-element eyepiece consisting of two achromatic lenses with extra lenses in between. They were invented during the first world war for military purposes, described in US patent by Heinrich Erfle number 1,478,704 of August 1921 and are a logical extension to wider fields of four element eyepieces such as Pl√∂ssls. Erfle eyepieces are designed to have wide field of view (about 60 degrees), but they are unusable at high powers because they suffer from astigmatism and ghost images. However, with lens coatings at low powers (focal lengths of 20 mm and up) they are acceptable, and at 40 mm they can be excellent. Erfles are very popular because they have large eye lenses, good eye relief and can be very comfortable to use. ===K√∂nig=== K√∂nig eyepiece diagram The K√∂nig eyepiece has a concave-convex positive doublet and a plano-convex singlet. The strongly convex surfaces of the doublet and singlet face and (nearly) touch each other. The doublet has its concave surface facing the light source and the singlet has its almost flat (slightly convex) surface facing the eye. It was designed in 1915 by German optician Albert K√∂nig (1871‚àí1946) as a simplified Abbe. The design allows for high magnification with remarkably high eye relief ‚Äî the highest eye relief proportional to focal length of any design before the Nagler, in 1979. The field of view of about 55¬∞ makes its performance similar to the Pl√∂ssl, with the advantage of requiring one less lens. Modern versions of K√∂nigs can use improved glass, or add more lenses, grouped into various combinations of doublets and singlets. The most typical adaptation is to add a positive, concave-convex simple lens before the doublet, with the concave face towards the light source and the convex surface facing the doublet. Modern improvements typically have fields of view of 60¬∞‚àí70¬∞. === RKE === RKE eyepiece diagram An RKE eyepiece has an achromatic field lens and double convex eye lens, a reversed adaptation of the Kellner eyepiece. It was designed by Dr. David Rank for the Edmund Scientific Corporation, who marketed it throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s. This design provides slightly wider field of view than classic Kellner design and makes its design similar to a widely spaced version of the K√∂nig. According to Edmund Scientific Corporation, RKE stands for \\"Rank Kellner Eyepiece'\\". In an amendment to their trademark application on January 16, 1979 it was given as \\"Rank, Kaspereit, Erfle\\", the three designs from which the eyepiece was derived.17 January 2008 http://tdr.uspto.gov/search.action?sn=73173827 === Nagler === Nagler type 2 eyepiece diagram Nagler type eyepieces Invented by Albert Nagler and patented in 1979, the Nagler eyepiece is a design optimized for astronomical telescopes to give an ultra-wide field of view (82¬∞) that has good correction for astigmatism and other aberrations. Introduced in 2007, the Ethos is an enhanced ultra-wide field design developed principally by Paul Dellechiaie under Albert Nagler's guidance at Tele Vue Optics and claims a 100-110¬∞ AFOV. This is achieved using exotic high-index glass and up to eight optical elements in four or five groups; there are five similar designs called the Nagler, Nagler type 2, Nagler type 4, Nagler type 5, and Nagler type 6. The newer Delos design is a modified Ethos design with a FOV of 'only' 72 degrees but with a long 20mm eye relief. The number of elements in a Nagler makes them seem complex, but the idea of the design is fairly simple: every Nagler has a negative doublet field lens, which increases magnification, followed by several positive groups. The positive groups, considered separate from the first negative group, combine to have long focal length, and form a positive lens. That allows the design to take advantage of the many good qualities of low power lenses. In effect, a Nagler is a superior version of a Barlow lens combined with a long focal length eyepiece. This design has been widely copied in other wide field or long eye relief eyepieces. The main disadvantage to Naglers is in their weight. Long focal length versions exceed , which is enough to unbalance small telescopes. Another disadvantage is a high purchase cost, with large Naglers' prices comparable to the cost of a small telescope. Hence these eyepieces are regarded by many amateur astronomers as a luxury.Martin C. Cohen .

It was promoted by the lead single \\"I Drove All Night\\". One Heart was produced mainly by Swedish producers: Max Martin, Rami Yacoub, Peer √Östr√∂m, Anders Bagge and Kristian Lundin. It topped the charts in various countries and was certified multi-platinum, platinum and gold around the world. One Heart has sold over five million copies worldwide. ==Background and content== The release of this album marked the beginning of A New Day..., Dion's five-year concert arrangement in The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. One Heart contains songs produced by Max Martin, Rami Yacoub, Peer √Östr√∂m, Anders Bagge, Ric Wake, Kristian Lundin, Kara DioGuardi, John Shanks, Guy Roche, and others. It includes a cover of Roy Orbison's \\"I Drove All Night\\", made famous by Cyndi Lauper. Another song, \\"Reveal\\" was written by Cathy Dennis who also wrote \\"Toxic\\" for Britney Spears and \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" for Kylie Minogue, among others. \\"Sorry for Love (2003 version)\\" is actually an original version of the song. The dance version was released a year earlier on A New Day Has Come. Already available on the A New Day Has Come 2002 special limited edition, \\"Coulda Woulda Shoulda\\" was included here as well. One Heart also features \\"Have You Ever Been in Love\\", taken from A New Day Has Come. The last track on the album, \\"Je t'aime encore\\" was recorded also in French and included on Dion's next album, 1 fille & 4 types. In June 2004, a bonus DVD called One Year... One Heart was included on some editions of A New Day... Live in Las Vegas, containing the recording of \\"I Drove All Night\\" and \\"Have You Ever Been in Love\\", and the making of \\"One Heart\\" music video among other features. ==Promotion== In the United States, \\"I Drove All Night\\", \\"Have You Ever Been in Love\\", \\"One Heart\\", and \\"Love Is All We Need\\" were used from 2003 to 2004 in an advertising campaign for DaimlerChrysler, and the CD's inlay cover had the Chrysler logo and slogan. ==Singles== \\"I Drove All Night\\" was chosen as the leadoff single and became a hit, reaching number one in Canada, Belgium and Sweden. Although \\"Have You Ever Been in Love\\" was already featured on Dion's previous album A New Day Has Come, it was released as the second single from One Heart in the United States and third in selected countries. It was successful on the Adult Contemporary charts in the US and Canada, reaching number two and three, respectively. The title track promoted the album as the second single outside the United States, and reached top forty in various countries, including number twenty-seven in the United Kingdom. There were also two radio releases at the end of 2003: \\"Stand by Your Side\\" in the US and \\"Faith\\" in Canada. ==Critical response== The album received mainly mixed reviews from most music critics. AllMusic's senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated it two-and-a-half stars out of possible five, writing that the collaboration with Britney Spears's producer Max Martin in three tracks was a sign of \\"desperation that underscores every minute of One Heart, where it seems like Dion will do anything to stay on the charts\\". Erlewine also wrote that \\"One Heart favors a smooth Vegas-showstopper gloss to radio-ready sheen, which only accentuates the lack of cohesiveness here\\" and that the album \\"reveals all her weaknesses\\". Chuck Arnold of People wrote a mixed review towards the album's songs, calling it \\"a bit jarring at times\\" and that \\"Dion sounds so strangely subdued on some tracks, you keep waiting for her to really let rip\\". Either way, he wrote positively that \\"There is a lightness to One Heart that has been missing from much of Dion's previous work, as she leans more toward upbeat dance numbers, easy-listening rock and even borderline country-pop\\". Entertainment.ie's Andrew Lynch was more negative, writing that \\"The problem is, Dion's songwriters seem to have been under strict instructions to keep the material as bland as possible. And while her glass- shattering voice is as spectacular as ever, she still doesn't sound as if she believes a word of what she's singing. One Heart is certainly one of her better collections - but frankly, that isn't saying very much\\". The Guardian's Betty Clarke wrote that \\"Dion proves she can be more than a series of hollow - if album-shifting - sentiments\\". Darryl Sterdan wrote a very negative review for Jam!, saying that \\"it's bad enough the 14-song CD is full of unoriginal, instantly forgettable fluff -- leftover Britney bubble-pop from Max Martin, cliche chest-pounding power ballads, a title cut that's a blatant Shania soundalike and a Cher-style Eurodisco revamp of the Roy Orbison hit \\"I Drove All Night,\\" which she's already turned into a Chrysler jingle\\". Instead of the mixed and negative reviews, a positive review came from Amazon's Rebecca Wallwork, who praised Dion for \\"an unrelenting theme of joy and believing in one's self\\" and highlighted the album for \\"being both well timed and well executed\\". But she revealed that \\"it contains no surprises, but then, besides her voice, that's one of Dion's biggest assets\\". In a more positive review, Entertainment Weeklys Elisabeth Vincentelli questioned \\"why Celine get so little respect?\\" and later went to praise the album for \\"Dion's uncanny ability to infuse sincerity into aural Hallmark cards and sound like the only person on earth who believes in true love\\". In the end, she wrote: \\"And in our age of postmodern ironists, isn't it refreshing to encounter someone who so genuinely loves her job?\\" Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani praised \\"the album as a whole\\", saying that \\"she continues the restrained approach of her last record, both in production and performance\\". He finished the review, noting that \\"One Heart may be the smartest album Dion could make at this stage in her career\\". Billboard praised the album by concluding: \\"One Heart may not crackle with the noise of an \\"event\\" record, but it succeeds at something far more important: It is a fine piece of music\\".Review by Billboard Retrieved 8 March 2015 ==Commercial performance== In Canada, One Heart shot to the top of the chart, selling 97,000 copies in its first week, making it the biggest debut of the year.

The bomb was tested during the Truman administration as part of Operation Ivy. This series of tests involved the development of very powerful nuclear weapons in response to the nuclear weapons program of the Soviet Union. The production of Ivy King was hurried to be ready in case its sister project, Ivy Mike, failed in its attempt to achieve a thermonuclear reaction. The Ivy King test actually took place two weeks after Mike. Unlike the Mike bomb, the Ivy King device could theoretically have been added to United States' nuclear arsenal because it was designed to be air-deliverable. Video of Ivy King test. On November 16, 1952 at 11:30 local time (23:30 GMT) a B-36H bomber dropped the bomb over a point north of Runit Island in the Enewetak atoll, resulting in a 500 kiloton explosion at . The tropopause height at the time of the detonation was about . The top of the King cloud reached about with the mushroom base at about .OPERATION IVY. Project 7.5. Dispersion of Gaseous Debris from Nuclear Explosions; Philip W. Allen, DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE WASHINGTON DC. Defense Technical Information Center, 1985. The Ivy King bomb, designated as a Mk-18 bomb and named the \\"Super Oralloy Bomb\\", was a modified version of the Mk-6D bomb. Instead of using an implosion system similar to the Mk-6D, it used a 92-point implosion system initially developed for the Mk-13. Its uranium-plutonium core was replaced by 60 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU) fashioned into a thin-walled sphere equivalent to approximately four critical masses. The thin-walled sphere was a commonly used design, which ensured that the fissile material remained sub-critical until imploded. The HEU sphere was then enclosed in a natural-uranium neutron reflector. To physically prevent the HEU sphere collapsing into a critical condition if the surrounding explosives were detonated accidentally, or if the sphere was crushed following an aircraft accident, the hollow center was filled with a chain made from aluminum and boron, which was pulled out to arm the bomb. The boron-coated chain also absorbed the neutrons needed to drive the nuclear reaction. The primary designer of the Super Oralloy Bomb, physicist Ted Taylor, later became a vocal proponent of nuclear disarmament. ==References== * *Chuck Hansen (1995) Swords of Armageddon.

It was her first new studio album since 1997's Let's Talk About Love. Dion returned to the music scene after a two-year hiatus when she gave birth to her first child in 2001. She collaborated on A New Day Has Come with various producers, including Anders Bagge and Peer √Östr√∂m for the first time. A New Day Has Come garnered mostly positive reviews from the music critics, who noticed that Dion explores a \\"broader, more adventurous\\" range of pop music and \\"dips its toe\\" into modern music, particularly dance (\\"Sorry for Love\\"). However, the album also contains the usual adult contemporary songs, including power ballads like \\"I Surrender\\", \\"Have You Ever Been in Love\\", and the title track. Critics also praised \\"Ten Days\\", \\"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\\", \\"I'm Alive\\", \\"When the Wrong One Loves You Right\\", \\"The Greatest Reward\\", and two covers: \\"Nature Boy\\" and \\"At Last\\". A New Day Has Come became a commercial success throughout the world and entered number one in more than seventeen countries. It has sold 3.3 million units in the United States and was certified three-times Platinum by the RIAA. In Canada, after shipping 600,000 copies, the album was certified six-times Platinum. The IFPI certified it three-times Platinum for selling three million units in Europe. Overall, A New Day Has Come has sold twelve million copies worldwide. The first single, \\"A New Day Has Come\\" was released in March 2002 and peaked inside the top ten in Canada and Europe. In the United States, it reached number twenty-two on the Billboard Hot 100 and broke the record for most weeks at number one on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart, staying on top for twenty-one weeks. The next single, \\"I'm Alive\\" was issued in August 2002 and also peaked inside the top ten in numerous European countries. The last commercial single, \\"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\\" was released in November 2002 and performed moderately on the charts, reaching the top forty in Europe. ==Background== After the farewell millennium concert on 31 December 1999 in Montreal, Dion decided to take a break from the public scene for two years to focus on her family. On 25 January 2001, she gave birth to Ren√©-Charles Angelil, her first son. Since then, she had performed publicly only a handful of times, including 21 September 2001, when she sang a live rendition of \\"God Bless America\\" at the America: A Tribute to Heroes telethon honoring victims of the September 11 attacks, and 28 September for Montreal's companion fund-raiser, A Show for Life, singing \\"L'amour existe encore\\". According to Dion, the album's title, A New Day Has Come, acknowledged a new chapter in her life and career. However, she was also deeply affected by the events of 11 September and wanted the words to serve as a reminder of the tragedy. \\"It represents my child, because I gave life,\\" Dion said. \\"Obviously, it also marks my return with a new album. But a new day has also come in the lives of other people because something bad has happened, because we've lost lives, because there's a scar on our world now\\". Dion struggled over an appropriate image for the cover of the album, feeling that a portrait reflecting her good fortune was in poor taste. She suggested to Sony Music Entertainment that the album cover not include her picture. However, after much discussion, the photo shoot for A New Day Has Come took place in Montreal in late December 2001 with well-renowned photographer Melvin Sokolsky. On 30 and 31 January 2002 an additional photo session for the album took place in Florida, on a beach near Dion's home by the French photographer Patrick Demarchelier. The album cover for A New Day Has Come by Demarchelier was released on 28 February 2002. Ren√© Ang√©lil, Dion, and the Sony family began selecting prospective songs at the beginning of 2001, and on 28 August 2001 she started recording vocal tracks for nearly two dozen songs at Montreal's Piccolo Studios. Because of Dion's unwillingness to leave her seven-month-old baby, the album's collaborators traveled to Montreal. \\"I didn't feel the pressure to try and outdo anything,\\" Dion said of her time in the studio. \\"I proved myself before, so now I can enjoy. I was relaxed, I just let go. It was such a pleasure\\". The album was scheduled for release internationally on 25 March 2002 and in North America on 26 March 2002. However, it was first released in Australia, on 22 March 2002. ==Content== Most of the producers of the album had worked with Dion before: Walter Afanasieff, Kristian Lundin, Andreas Carlsson, Christopher Neil, Guy Roche, Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange, Ric Wake, Aldo Nova, Simon Franglen and Humberto Gatica. The new ones included Swedish musicians Anders Bagge, Peer √Östr√∂m and Arnthor Birgisson, French singer G√©rald de Palmas and the US producer Steve Morales. A New Day Has Come showcases Dion's traditional themes of love and hope. She sings ballads alongside several uptempo pop tracks and a pair of standards. The album contains sixteen tracks on the North American version and seventeen on the international editions, including \\"Super Love\\". It features \\"A New Day Has Come\\", the title track, which for Dion represents the birth of her child but \\"it can mean different things for anyone who has to find strength again\\"; I'm Alive\\", \\"fun\\" and \\"fresh\\" song from the team that wrote \\"That's the Way It Is\\"; \\"I Surrender\\", the album's \\"bombastic, heart- pounding\\" ballad which has become a popular song choice for contestants on reality television singing competitions like American Idol;A New Day Has Come Collector's Edition liner notes by Chuck Taylor: \\"\\"I Surrender,\\" which would later become a favorite among America Idol finalists vying to validate vocal prowess\\" \\"Sorry for Love\\", a dance number written and produced by the Swedish team, co-written by Kara DioGuardi; \\"Have You Ever Been in Love\\", a power ballad also written and produced by Bagge and √Östr√∂m; \\"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\\", an emotional ballad about the death of one's mother which Dion first heard three years prior but turned it down at that time; \\"Nature Boy\\", a 1947 song made popular by Nat King Cole that features Dion accompanied only by piano as originally foreseen symphonic orchestration was not added; \\"At Last\\", a gospel-tinged number first recorded by Glenn Miller in 1941; \\"Ten Days\\", a rock-oriented adaptation of \\"Tomber\\" (2000) by G√©rald de Palmas which was recorded at the last minute after Dion heard the original French version; \\"The Greatest Reward\\", an adaptation of \\"L'envie d'aimer\\" (2000) from the French musical Les Dix Commandements, performed originally by Daniel L√©vi; and \\"Aun Existe Amor\\", a Spanish-language version of Dion's French song \\"L'amour existe encore\\". ===Special editions=== On 11 November 2002 in Europe and 19 November 2002 in North America, Sony Music Entertainment released a Limited Edition of A New Day Has Come, which includes the original album, as well as a bonus DVD featuring the \\"I'm Alive\\" video, a preview of Dion's Las Vegas show A New Day... as well as two previously unreleased tracks, \\"Coulda Woulda Shoulda\\" and \\"All Because of You\\". The North American Limited Edition includes a longer version of \\"The Greatest Reward\\" lasting 4:04, instead of original 3:28. On 29 January 2008, Legacy Recordings released a Collector's Edition of A New Day Has Come with bonus DVD.

The first one was issued after Dion performed the song at the Billboard Latin Music Awards in May 2002 where she was honoured with a special award for \\"My Heart Will Go On\\", which was the first English-language song to top Billboards Hot Latin Tracks chart. \\"At Last\\" was sent to the adult contemporary radio stations in December 2002 and peaked at number sixteen on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks. Although not changed, \\"Have You Ever Been in Love\\" was also included on Dion's next album, One Heart and released as a single in April 2003. The song spent fourteen weeks at number two on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks in the United States. ==Critical reception== The album garnered generally positive reviews from music critics. Chuck Taylor from Billboard gave it a favorable review, saying that Dion explores a \\"broader, more adventurous\\" range of pop music. Among the highlights, he mentioned \\"Sorry for Love\\" where Dion \\"dishes out her first all-out dance anthem\\" and holds a twelve-second \\"authentic note that puts the \\"d\\" in diva\\", \\"I'm Alive\\" and \\"When the Wrong One Loves You Right\\", which he described as \\"hitworthy uptempo gems\\", the rock-leaning \\"Ten Days\\", and a Spanish track, \\"Aun Existe Amor\\". According to Taylor, Dion does not disappoint with ballads like the \\"rafter-shaking\\" \\"I Surrender\\" where she sings of \\"forbidden love amid a firestorm of utterly volcanic instrumentation\\" and \\"The Greatest Reward\\", and two standards ‚Äì the \\"diamond-dipped\\" \\"Nature Boy\\" and gospel \\"At Last\\". He called the album the most \\"versatile and gratifying\\" Dion's recording yet. Larry Flick, also from Billboard wrote about another song, \\"Have You Ever Been in Love\\" that \\"at a time when music is frightfully aggressive and the world at large is fraught with turmoil, a classic Dion power ballad is a warm source of comfort\\". The track \\"builds from a gentle, piano-laced opening into a deliciously theatrical, string-framed climax\\". All along, Dion offers an \\"appealing palette of vocal colors that range from delicate and breathy to full-bodied and appropriately dramatic\\". Chuck Taylor also reviewed all three singles from the album. He wrote that the life- affirming \\"A New Day Has Come\\" \\"comes off like a gentle exhale against the world's ills\\". The Ric Wake Radio Remix of \\"A New Day Has Come\\" opens with an \\"Enya-inspired whisper before a shuffle skips in and lifts the song upward like a dove gracefully taking flight\\". The Album Edit \\"comes sans the beat, allowing Dion's performance alone to fully color the message\\". According to him, on both versions Dion \\"embraces a particularly restrained performance ‚Äì dramatic enough to steer the track's emotion, but still delicate to offer comfort\\". \\"I'm Alive\\" demonstrates a stylistic \\"left turn, with its throbbing tribal rhythms and a loose, sky-grazing vocal from Dion\\". The \\"percolating\\" Humberto Gatica Mix \\"adds juice\\" to the Album Version, while the uptempo Wake Up Mix, with assistance from Ric Wake and Richie Jones, is Dion's most \\"inspired and festive\\" remix to date, with Blondie's \\"Heart of Glass\\" woven into the beat to \\"splendid effect\\". Taylor criticized the choice of the third single, \\"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\\", a ballad relegated solely to adult contemporary radio stations. He noticed that the song is \\"devastatingly beautiful\\", offering a loving tribute to one's mother at death's door and that Dion \\"delivers it with a heaving helping of passion, emotionally drawing one's attention to the devotional message\\". Although he felt that many will connect to the loss of a parent, on a commercial level, this was a disappointing decision. According to Taylor, songs like \\"Sorry for Love\\" and \\"When the Wrong One Loves You Right\\" were primed for radio airplay and dancefloor remixes and were ideal candidates for release. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album three and a half out of five stars saying that its construction is \\"as perfect as it could be\\". It doesn't \\"deviate\\" from Dion's mainstream audience, yet it \\"dips its toe\\" into modern music, particularly dance, while \\"keeping hip\\" (\\"Nature Boy\\"). Although Erlewine described \\"Rain, Tax (It's Inevitable)\\" as \\"bizarre\\", he wrote that \\"there's really nothing to fault it on, actually,\\" the album is \\"more ambitious than it needs to be, covers more stylistic territory than any other Dion record, while never abandoning the middle-of-the-road; it's a balancing act that nobody since Barbra Streisand has been able to pull off\\". According to Erlewine, the songs aren't \\"that particularly memorable\\", \\"the mood shifts effortlessly, it never seems to stay in one place,\\" but it \\"never catches hold, either\\". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave A New Day Has Come three out of five stars. According to him, Dion is great at what she does and \\"if she ever tried anything too edgy she'd probably just sound foolish\\". Cinquemani disliked \\"Rain, Tax (It's Inevitable)\\" but praised \\"Sorry for Love\\" on which Dion \\"gets the Cher treatment\\", an unexpected \\"change of pace that actually works\\". Among other highlights he mentioned two covers, a \\"soulful\\" rendition of \\"At Last\\" and a \\"simple and moving\\" arrangement of \\"Nature Boy\\". He also noticed that the album is \\"packed\\" with the usual adult contemporary songs: \\"I Surrender\\", a power ballad \\"only a singer with Dion's voice could pull off,\\" \\"Ten Days\\", the guitar-driven \\"catchy pop-rocker with a surprisingly edgy vocal,\\" \\"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\\", a track featuring Shania Twain on backing vocals that \\"will leave you nauseous or in tears\\", \\"I'm Alive\\", the \\"uplifting\\" midtempo number and \\"A New Day Has Come\\", the \\"stirring\\" title track. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the album B‚àí. He felt that A New Day Has Come was \\"over-arranged\\" by producers, which works \\"against Dion's enthusiasm for the wonders of babies and innocence\\". Nevertheless, he praised the \\"jaunty disco\\" of \\"Sorry for Love\\", and \\"Have You Ever Been in Love\\" which \\"builds in intensity to sound like \\"a James Bond movie theme as delivered by Barbra Streisand\\". Tucker described \\"Rain, Tax (It's Inevitable)\\" as the most \\"idiosyncratic\\" and \\"idiomatic\\" song that Dion has ever recorded. According to the positive review from Mike Ross of Jam!, A New Day Has Come \\"picks up where Falling into You left off\\". Dion's album is a full of \\"bombast, melodrama and soaring love ballads indistinguishable from anything she's ever done\\". Attempts at modernity are \\"spotty\\", though \\"welcome\\". Ross noticed that ballads are the strongest tracks on the album and praised \\"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\\", with \\"two soaring key changes\\" in the same song, which is then launched into a \\"high Earth orbit of melodrama by an orchestra that would make John Williams blush with envy\\". Barnes & Noble also gave the album favorable review and wrote that the new songs reveal a more \\"spiritual\\" and \\"edgier\\" Dion. They praised the \\"uplifting\\" title track, \\"heartfelt, country-tinged\\" \\"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\\", \\"anthemic, gospel choir-accented ballad\\" \\"Prayer\\", \\"bluesy, honky-tonk rocker\\" \\"Ten Days\\", \\"soaring ballad\\" \\"Have You Ever Been in Love\\", and \\"solid renditions\\" of \\"Nature Boy\\" and \\"At Last\\". ==Commercial reception== Dion earned two career achievements with the debut of A New Day Has Come in the United States. It became her first album to open at number-one on the Billboard 200 ‚Äì her fourth number-one overall ‚Äì and it set a personal best for first-week sales (558,000 units). Previously, 1997's Let's Talk About Love sold 334,000 in its first week, while 1999's All the Way... A Decade of Song opened with 303,000. The 558,000 tally became Dion's third largest one-week total, following 640,000 units of All the Way ... A Decade of Song and 624,000 copies of Let's Talk About Love, both during Christmas periods. In the second week, A New Day Has Come fell to number two selling 263,000 copies. It stayed there for another week with sales of 226,000 units. For the next two weeks, A New Day Has Come occupied the number three position and sold 163,000 and 114,000 copies respectively. In the sixth week, it fell to number six selling 101,000 units and in the seventh week it climbed to number two with 143,000 copies sold. A New Day Has Come spent ten weeks inside the top ten on the Billboard 200. On the list of best selling albums of 2002 in the United States, it reached number 12 with sales of 2,645,000 units. In January 2003, it was certified three-times Platinum by the RIAA and as of 5 December 2010, it has sold 3,307,000 copies in the United States. In Canada, A New Day Has Come debuted at number-one, selling 151,600 copies ‚Äî more than ten times her nearest competition, Shakira's Laundry Service (12,200). It stayed at number-one for seven straight weeks marking Dion's longest run at number- one, beating the six-week reign of The Colour of My Love. It was certified six-times Platinum by the CRIA. A New Day Has Come topped the charts in most European countries and was certified Multi-Platinum, Platinum and Gold. After selling three million copies in Europe and spending seven weeks at number-one on the European Top 100 Albums, it was certified three-times Platinum by the IFPI. A New Day Has Come also peaked at number-one in Australia and New Zealand and was certified two-times Platinum in both countries. The album entered number one in more than seventeen countries, becoming the biggest debut of 2002. The commercial success of A New Day Has Come led to its fifth position on the list of best selling albums of 2002, according to the IFPI. It has sold twelve million copies worldwide.Chuck Taylor (2008). A New Day Has Come Collector's Edition liner notes. p. 2.: \\"(...) and ultimately selling 12 million copies worldwide (...)\\". ==Accolades== In 2003, Dion won the American Music Award for Favorite Adult Contemporary Artist and was nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist.

It is frequently used to calculate trajectories of particles in molecular dynamics simulations and computer graphics. The algorithm was first used in 1791 by Delambre and has been rediscovered many times since then, most recently by Loup Verlet in the 1960s for use in molecular dynamics. It was also used by Cowell and Crommelin in 1909 to compute the orbit of Halley's Comet, and by Carl St√∏rmer in 1907 to study the trajectories of electrical particles in a magnetic field (hence it is also called St√∂rmer's method). The Verlet integrator provides good numerical stability, as well as other properties that are important in physical systems such as time reversibility and preservation of the symplectic form on phase space, at no significant additional computational cost over the simple Euler method. ==Basic St√∂rmer‚ÄìVerlet== For a second-order differential equation of the type \\\\ddot{\\\\vec x}(t) = \\\\vec A\\\\big(\\\\vec x(t)\\\\big) with initial conditions \\\\vec x(t_0) = \\\\vec x_0 and \\\\dot{\\\\vec x}(t_0) = \\\\vec v_0, an approximate numerical solution \\\\vec x_n \\\\approx \\\\vec x(t_n) at the times t_n = t_0 + n\\\\,\\\\Delta t with step size \\\\Delta t > 0 can be obtained by the following method: * set \\\\vec x_1 = \\\\vec x_0 + \\\\vec v_0\\\\,\\\\Delta t + \\\\frac12 \\\\vec A(\\\\vec x_0)\\\\,\\\\Delta t^2, * for n = 1, 2, ... iterate *: \\\\vec x_{n+1} = 2 \\\\vec x_n - \\\\vec x_{n-1} + \\\\vec A(\\\\vec x_n)\\\\,\\\\Delta t^2. ===Equations of motion=== Newton's equation of motion for conservative physical systems is :M \\\\ddot{\\\\vec x}(t) = F\\\\big(\\\\vec x(t)\\\\big) = - abla V\\\\big(\\\\vec x(t)\\\\big), or individually :m_k \\\\ddot{\\\\vec x}_k(t) = F_k\\\\big(\\\\vec x(t)\\\\big) = - abla_{\\\\vec x_k} V\\\\big(\\\\vec x(t)\\\\big), where : t is the time, : \\\\vec x(t) = \\\\big(\\\\vec x_1(t), \\\\ldots, \\\\vec x_N(t)\\\\big) is the ensemble of the position vector of N objects, : V is the scalar potential function, : F is the negative gradient of the potential, giving the ensemble of forces on the particles, : M is the mass matrix, typically diagonal with blocks with mass m_k for every particle. This equation, for various choices of the potential function V, can be used to describe the evolution of diverse physical systems, from the motion of interacting molecules to the orbit of the planets. After a transformation to bring the mass to the right side and forgetting the structure of multiple particles, the equation may be simplified to :\\\\ddot{\\\\vec x}(t) = A\\\\big(\\\\vec x(t)\\\\big) with some suitable vector-valued function A representing the position-dependent acceleration. Typically, an initial position \\\\vec x(0) = \\\\vec x_0 and an initial velocity \\\\vec v(0) = \\\\dot{\\\\vec x}(0) = \\\\vec v_0 are also given. ===Verlet integration (without velocities)=== To discretize and numerically solve this initial value problem, a time step \\\\Delta t > 0 is chosen, and the sampling-point sequence t_n = n\\\\,\\\\Delta t considered. The task is to construct a sequence of points \\\\vec x_n that closely follow the points \\\\vec x(t_n) on the trajectory of the exact solution. Where Euler's method uses the forward difference approximation to the first derivative in differential equations of order one, Verlet integration can be seen as using the central difference approximation to the second derivative: : \\\\frac{\\\\Delta^2\\\\vec x_n}{\\\\Delta t^2} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{\\\\vec x_{n+1} - \\\\vec x_n}{\\\\Delta t} - \\\\frac{\\\\vec x_n - \\\\vec x_{n-1}}{\\\\Delta t}}{\\\\Delta t} = \\\\frac{\\\\vec x_{n+1} - 2 \\\\vec x_n + \\\\vec x_{n-1}}{\\\\Delta t^2} = \\\\vec a_n = \\\\vec A(\\\\vec x_n). Verlet integration in the form used as the St√∂rmer methodwebpage with a description of the St√∂rmer method. uses this equation to obtain the next position vector from the previous two without using the velocity as : \\\\vec x_{n+1} = 2 \\\\vec x_n - \\\\vec x_{n-1} + \\\\vec a_n\\\\,\\\\Delta t^2, \\\\qquad \\\\vec a_n = \\\\vec A(\\\\vec x_n). ===Discretisation error=== The time symmetry inherent in the method reduces the level of local errors introduced into the integration by the discretization by removing all odd-degree terms, here the terms in \\\\Delta t of degree three. The local error is quantified by inserting the exact values \\\\vec x(t_{n-1}), \\\\vec x(t_n), \\\\vec x(t_{n+1}) into the iteration and computing the Taylor expansions at time t = t_n of the position vector \\\\vec{x}(t \\\\pm \\\\Delta t) in different time directions: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\vec{x}(t + \\\\Delta t) &= \\\\vec{x}(t) + \\\\vec{v}(t)\\\\Delta t + \\\\frac{\\\\vec{a}(t) \\\\Delta t^2}{2} \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\vec{b}(t) \\\\Delta t^3}{6} + \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\Delta t^4)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vec{x}(t - \\\\Delta t) &= \\\\vec{x}(t) - \\\\vec{v}(t)\\\\Delta t + \\\\frac{\\\\vec{a}(t) \\\\Delta t^2}{2} \\\\- \\\\frac{\\\\vec{b}(t) \\\\Delta t^3}{6} + \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\Delta t^4), \\\\end{align} where \\\\vec{x} is the position, \\\\vec{v} = \\\\dot{\\\\vec x} the velocity, \\\\vec{a} = \\\\ddot{\\\\vec x} the acceleration, and \\\\vec{b} the jerk (third derivative of the position with respect to the time). Adding these two expansions gives :\\\\vec{x}(t + \\\\Delta t) = 2\\\\vec{x}(t) - \\\\vec{x}(t - \\\\Delta t) + \\\\vec{a}(t) \\\\Delta t^2 + \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\Delta t^4). We can see that the first- and third- order terms from the Taylor expansion cancel out, thus making the Verlet integrator an order more accurate than integration by simple Taylor expansion alone. Caution should be applied to the fact that the acceleration here is computed from the exact solution, \\\\vec a(t) = A\\\\big(\\\\vec x(t)\\\\big), whereas in the iteration it is computed at the central iteration point, \\\\vec a_n = A(\\\\vec x_n). In computing the global error, that is the distance between exact solution and approximation sequence, those two terms do not cancel exactly, influencing the order of the global error. ===A simple example=== To gain insight into the relation of local and global errors, it is helpful to examine simple examples where the exact solution, as well as the approximate solution, can be expressed in explicit formulas. The standard example for this task is the exponential function. Consider the linear differential equation \\\\ddot x(t) = w^2 x(t) with a constant w. Its exact basis solutions are e^{wt} and e^{-wt}. The St√∂rmer method applied to this differential equation leads to a linear recurrence relation :x_{n+1} - 2x_n + x_{n-1} = h^2 w^2 x_n, or :x_{n+1} - 2\\\\left(1 + \\\\tfrac12(wh)^2\\\\right) x_n + x_{n-1} = 0. It can be solved by finding the roots of its characteristic polynomial q^2 - 2\\\\left(1 + \\\\tfrac12(wh)^2\\\\right)q + 1 = 0. These are :q_\\\\pm = 1 + \\\\tfrac12(wh)^2 \\\\pm wh \\\\sqrt{1 + \\\\tfrac14(wh)^2}. The basis solutions of the linear recurrence are x_n = q_+^n and x_n = q_-^n. To compare them with the exact solutions, Taylor expansions are computed: :\\\\begin{align} q_+ &= 1 + \\\\tfrac12(wh)^2 + wh\\\\left(1 + \\\\tfrac18(wh)^2 - \\\\tfrac{3}{128}(wh)^4 + \\\\mathcal O(h^6)\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= 1 + (wh) + \\\\tfrac12(wh)^2 + \\\\tfrac18(wh)^3 - \\\\tfrac{3}{128}(wh)^5 + \\\\mathcal O(h^7). \\\\end{align} The quotient of this series with the one of the exponential e^{wh} starts with 1 - \\\\tfrac1{24}(wh)^3 + \\\\mathcal O(h^5), so :\\\\begin{align} q_+ &= \\\\left(1 - \\\\tfrac1{24}(wh)^3 + \\\\mathcal O(h^5)\\\\right)e^{wh}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= e^{-\\\\frac{1}{24}(wh)^3 + \\\\mathcal O(h^5)}\\\\,e^{wh}. \\\\end{align} From there it follows that for the first basis solution the error can be computed as :\\\\begin{align} x_n = q_+^{\\\\;n} &= e^{-\\\\frac{1}{24}(wh)^2\\\\,wt_n + \\\\mathcal O(h^4)}\\\\,e^{wt_n}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= e^{wt_n}\\\\left(1 - \\\\tfrac{1}{24}(wh)^2\\\\,wt_n + \\\\mathcal O(h^4)\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= e^{wt_n} + \\\\mathcal O(h^2 t_n e^{wt_n}). \\\\end{align} That is, although the local discretization error is of order 4, due to the second order of the differential equation the global error is of order 2, with a constant that grows exponentially in time. ===Starting the iteration=== Note that at the start of the Verlet iteration at step n = 1, time t = t_1 = \\\\Delta t, computing \\\\vec x_2, one already needs the position vector \\\\vec x_1 at time t = t_1. At first sight, this could give problems, because the initial conditions are known only at the initial time t_0 = 0. However, from these the acceleration \\\\vec a_0 = \\\\vec A(\\\\vec x_0) is known, and a suitable approximation for the position at the first time step can be obtained using the Taylor polynomial of degree two: : \\\\vec x_1 = \\\\vec{x}_0 + \\\\vec{v}_0 \\\\Delta t + \\\\tfrac12 \\\\vec a_0 \\\\Delta t^2 \\\\approx \\\\vec{x}(\\\\Delta t) + \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\Delta t^3). The error on the first time step then is of order \\\\mathcal O(\\\\Delta t^3). This is not considered a problem because on a simulation over a large number of time steps, the error on the first time step is only a negligibly small amount of the total error, which at time t_n is of the order \\\\mathcal O(e^{Lt_n} \\\\Delta t^2), both for the distance of the position vectors \\\\vec x_n to \\\\vec x(t_n) as for the distance of the divided differences \\\\tfrac{\\\\vec x_{n+1} - \\\\vec x_n}{\\\\Delta t} to \\\\tfrac{\\\\vec x(t_{n+1}) - \\\\vec x(t_n)}{\\\\Delta t}. Moreover, to obtain this second-order global error, the initial error needs to be of at least third order. ===Non- constant time differences=== A disadvantage of the St√∂rmer‚ÄìVerlet method is that if the time step (\\\\Delta t) changes, the method does not approximate the solution to the differential equation. This can be corrected using the formula : \\\\vec x_{i+1} = \\\\vec x_i \\\\+ (\\\\vec x_i - \\\\vec x_{i-1}) (\\\\Delta t_i / \\\\Delta t_{i-1}) \\\\+ \\\\vec a_i \\\\Delta t_i^2. A more exact derivation uses the Taylor series (to second order) at t_i for times t_{i+1} = t_i + \\\\Delta t_i and t_{i-1} = t_i - \\\\Delta t_{i-1} to obtain after elimination of \\\\vec v_i : \\\\frac{\\\\vec x_{i+1} - \\\\vec x_i}{\\\\Delta t_i} \\\\+ \\\\frac{\\\\vec x_{i-1} - \\\\vec x_i}{\\\\Delta t_{i-1}} = \\\\vec a_i\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\Delta t_{i} + \\\\Delta t_{i-1}}2, so that the iteration formula becomes : \\\\vec x_{i+1} = \\\\vec x_i \\\\+ (\\\\vec x_i - \\\\vec x_{i-1}) \\\\frac{\\\\Delta t_i}{\\\\Delta t_{i-1}} \\\\+ \\\\vec a_i\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\Delta t_{i} + \\\\Delta t_{i-1}}2\\\\,\\\\Delta t_i. ===Computing velocities ‚Äì St√∂rmer‚ÄìVerlet method=== The velocities are not explicitly given in the basic St√∂rmer equation, but often they are necessary for the calculation of certain physical quantities like the kinetic energy. This can create technical challenges in molecular dynamics simulations, because kinetic energy and instantaneous temperatures at time t cannot be calculated for a system until the positions are known at time t + \\\\Delta t. This deficiency can either be dealt with using the velocity Verlet algorithm or by estimating the velocity using the position terms and the mean value theorem: : \\\\vec{v}(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\vec{x}(t + \\\\Delta t) - \\\\vec{x}(t - \\\\Delta t)}{2\\\\Delta t} \\\\+ \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\Delta t^2). Note that this velocity term is a step behind the position term, since this is for the velocity at time t, not t + \\\\Delta t, meaning that \\\\vec v_n = \\\\tfrac{\\\\vec x_{n+1} - \\\\vec x_{n-1}}{2\\\\Delta t} is a second-order approximation to \\\\vec{v}(t_n). With the same argument, but halving the time step, \\\\vec v_{n+1/2} = \\\\tfrac{\\\\vec x_{n+1} - \\\\vec x_n}{\\\\Delta t} is a second-order approximation to \\\\vec{v}(t_{n+1/2}), with t_{n+1/2} = t_n + \\\\tfrac12 \\\\Delta t. One can shorten the interval to approximate the velocity at time t + \\\\Delta t at the cost of accuracy: :\\\\vec{v}(t + \\\\Delta t) = \\\\frac{\\\\vec{x}(t + \\\\Delta t) - \\\\vec{x}(t)}{\\\\Delta t} + \\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\Delta t). == Velocity Verlet == A related, and more commonly used, algorithm is the velocity Verlet algorithm, similar to the leapfrog method, except that the velocity and position are calculated at the same value of the time variable (leapfrog does not, as the name suggests). This uses a similar approach, but explicitly incorporates velocity, solving the problem of the first time step in the basic Verlet algorithm: :\\\\vec{x}(t + \\\\Delta t) = \\\\vec{x}(t) + \\\\vec{v}(t)\\\\, \\\\Delta t + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\,\\\\vec{a}(t) \\\\Delta t^2, :\\\\vec{v}(t + \\\\Delta t) = \\\\vec{v}(t) + \\\\frac{\\\\vec{a}(t) + \\\\vec{a}(t + \\\\Delta t)}{2} \\\\Delta t. It can be shown that the error in the velocity Verlet is of the same order as in the basic Verlet. Note that the velocity algorithm is not necessarily more memory-consuming, because it's not necessary to keep track of the velocity at every time step during the simulation. The standard implementation scheme of this algorithm is: # Calculate \\\\vec{v}\\\\left(t + \\\\tfrac12\\\\,\\\\Delta t\\\\right) = \\\\vec{v}(t) + \\\\tfrac12\\\\,\\\\vec{a}(t)\\\\,\\\\Delta t. # Calculate \\\\vec{x}(t + \\\\Delta t) = \\\\vec{x}(t) + \\\\vec{v}\\\\left(t + \\\\tfrac12\\\\,\\\\Delta t\\\\right)\\\\, \\\\Delta t. # Derive \\\\vec{a}(t + \\\\Delta t) from the interaction potential using \\\\vec{x}(t + \\\\Delta t). # Calculate \\\\vec{v}(t + \\\\Delta t) = \\\\vec{v}\\\\left(t + \\\\tfrac12\\\\,\\\\Delta t\\\\right) + \\\\tfrac12\\\\,\\\\vec{a}(t + \\\\Delta t)\\\\Delta t. Eliminating the half-step velocity, this algorithm may be shortened to # Calculate \\\\vec{x}(t + \\\\Delta t) = \\\\vec{x}(t) + \\\\vec{v}(t)\\\\,\\\\Delta t + \\\\tfrac12 \\\\,\\\\vec{a}(t)\\\\,\\\\Delta t^2. # Derive \\\\vec{a}(t + \\\\Delta t) from the interaction potential using \\\\vec{x}(t + \\\\Delta t). # Calculate \\\\vec{v}(t + \\\\Delta t) = \\\\vec{v}(t) + \\\\tfrac12\\\\,\\\\big(\\\\vec{a}(t) + \\\\vec{a}(t + \\\\Delta t)\\\\big)\\\\Delta t. Note, however, that this algorithm assumes that acceleration \\\\vec{a}(t + \\\\Delta t) only depends on position \\\\vec{x}(t + \\\\Delta t) and does not depend on velocity \\\\vec{v}(t + \\\\Delta t). One might note that the long-term results of velocity Verlet, and similarly of leapfrog are one order better than the semi-implicit Euler method. The algorithms are almost identical up to a shift by half a time step in the velocity. This is easily proven by rotating the above loop to start at step 3 and then noticing that the acceleration term in step 1 could be eliminated by combining steps 2 and 4. The only difference is that the midpoint velocity in velocity Verlet is considered the final velocity in semi-implicit Euler method. The global error of all Euler methods is of order one, whereas the global error of this method is, similar to the midpoint method, of order two. Additionally, if the acceleration indeed results from the forces in a conservative mechanical or Hamiltonian system, the energy of the approximation essentially oscillates around the constant energy of the exactly solved system, with a global error bound again of order one for semi- explicit Euler and order two for Verlet-leapfrog. The same goes for all other conserved quantities of the system like linear or angular momentum, that are always preserved or nearly preserved in a symplectic integrator. The velocity Verlet method is a special case of the Newmark-beta method with \\\\beta = 0 and \\\\gamma = 1/2. === Algorithmic representation === Since velocity Verlet is a generally useful algorithm in 3D applications, a general solution written in C++ could look like below. A simplified drag force is used to demonstrate change in acceleration, however it is only needed if acceleration is not constant. struct Body { Vec3d pos { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 }; Vec3d vel { 2.0, 0.0, 0.0 }; // 2m/s along x-axis Vec3d acc { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 }; // no acceleration at first double mass = 1.0; // 1kg double drag = 0.1; // rho*C*Area - simplified drag for this example /** * Update pos and vel using \\"Velocity Verlet\\" integration * @param dt DeltaTime / time step [eg: 0.01] */ void update(double dt) { Vec3d new_pos = pos + vel*dt + acc*(dt*dt*0.5); Vec3d new_acc = apply_forces(); // only needed if acceleration is not constant Vec3d new_vel = vel + (acc+new_acc)*(dt*0.5); pos = new_pos; vel = new_vel; acc = new_acc; } Vec3d apply_forces() const { Vec3d grav_acc = Vec3d{0.0, 0.0, -9.81 }; // 9.81m/s^2 down in the Z-axis Vec3d drag_force = 0.5 * drag * (vel * abs(vel)); // D = 0.5 * (rho * C * Area * vel^2) Vec3d drag_acc = drag_force / mass; // a = F/m return grav_acc - drag_acc; } }; ==Error terms== The local error in position of the Verlet integrator is O(\\\\Delta t^4) as described above, and the local error in velocity is O(\\\\Delta t^2). The global error in position, in contrast, is O(\\\\Delta t^2), and the global error in velocity is O(\\\\Delta t^2). These can be derived by noting the following: :\\\\mathrm{error}\\\\bigl(x(t_0 + \\\\Delta t)\\\\bigr) = O(\\\\Delta t^4) and :x(t_0 + 2\\\\Delta t) = 2x(t_0 + \\\\Delta t) - x(t_0) + \\\\Delta t^2 x(t_0 + \\\\Delta t) + O(\\\\Delta t^4). Therefore :\\\\mathrm{error}\\\\bigl(x(t_0 + 2\\\\Delta t)\\\\bigr) = 2\\\\mathrm{error}\\\\bigl(x(t_0 + \\\\Delta t)\\\\bigr) + O(\\\\Delta t^4) = 3\\\\,O(\\\\Delta t^4). Similarly: :\\\\mathrm{error}\\\\bigl(x(t_0 + 3\\\\Delta t)\\\\bigl) = 6\\\\,O(\\\\Delta t^4), :\\\\mathrm{error}\\\\bigl(x(t_0 + 4\\\\Delta t)\\\\bigl) = 10\\\\,O(\\\\Delta t^4), :\\\\mathrm{error}\\\\bigl(x(t_0 + 5\\\\Delta t)\\\\bigl) = 15\\\\,O(\\\\Delta t^4), which can be generalized to (it can be shown by induction, but it is given here without proof): :\\\\mathrm{error}\\\\bigl(x(t_0 + n\\\\Delta t)\\\\bigr) = \\\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\\\,O(\\\\Delta t^4). If we consider the global error in position between x(t) and x(t + T), where T = n\\\\Delta t, it is clear that :\\\\mathrm{error}\\\\bigl(x(t_0 + T)\\\\bigr) = \\\\left(\\\\frac{T^2}{2\\\\Delta t^2} + \\\\frac{T}{2\\\\Delta t}\\\\right) O(\\\\Delta t^4), and therefore, the global (cumulative) error over a constant interval of time is given by :\\\\mathrm{error}\\\\bigr(x(t_0 + T)\\\\bigl) = O(\\\\Delta t^2). Because the velocity is determined in a non-cumulative way from the positions in the Verlet integrator, the global error in velocity is also O(\\\\Delta t^2). In molecular dynamics simulations, the global error is typically far more important than the local error, and the Verlet integrator is therefore known as a second- order integrator. ==Constraints== Systems of multiple particles with constraints are simpler to solve with Verlet integration than with Euler methods. Constraints between points may be, for example, potentials constraining them to a specific distance or attractive forces. They may be modeled as springs connecting the particles. Using springs of infinite stiffness, the model may then be solved with a Verlet algorithm. In one dimension, the relationship between the unconstrained positions \\\\tilde{x}_i^{(t)} and the actual positions x_i^{(t)} of points i at time t can be found with the algorithm :d_1 = x_2^{(t)} - x_1^{(t)}, :d_2 = \\\\d_1\\\\, :d_3 = \\\\frac{d_2 - r}{d_2}, :x_1^{(t + \\\\Delta t)} = \\\\tilde{x}_1^{(t + \\\\Delta t)} + \\\\frac{1}{2} d_1 d_3, :x_2^{(t + \\\\Delta t)} = \\\\tilde{x}_2^{(t + \\\\Delta t)} - \\\\frac{1}{2} d_1 d_3. Verlet integration is useful because it directly relates the force to the position, rather than solving the problem using velocities. Problems, however, arise when multiple constraining forces act on each particle. One way to solve this is to loop through every point in a simulation, so that at every point the constraint relaxation of the last is already used to speed up the spread of the information. In a simulation this may be implemented by using small time steps for the simulation, using a fixed number of constraint-solving steps per time step, or solving constraints until they are met by a specific deviation. When approximating the constraints locally to first order, this is the same as the Gauss‚ÄìSeidel method. For small matrices it is known that LU decomposition is faster. Large systems can be divided into clusters (for example, each ragdoll = cluster). Inside clusters the LU method is used, between clusters the Gauss‚ÄìSeidel method is used. The matrix code can be reused: The dependency of the forces on the positions can be approximated locally to first order, and the Verlet integration can be made more implicit. Sophisticated software, such as SuperLUSuperLU User's Guide. exists to solve complex problems using sparse matrices. Specific techniques, such as using (clusters of) matrices, may be used to address the specific problem, such as that of force propagating through a sheet of cloth without forming a sound wave. Another way to solve holonomic constraints is to use constraint algorithms. ==Collision reactions== One way of reacting to collisions is to use a penalty-based system, which basically applies a set force to a point upon contact. The problem with this is that it is very difficult to choose the force imparted. Use too strong a force, and objects will become unstable, too weak, and the objects will penetrate each other. Another way is to use projection collision reactions, which takes the offending point and attempts to move it the shortest distance possible to move it out of the other object. The Verlet integration would automatically handle the velocity imparted by the collision in the latter case; however, note that this is not guaranteed to do so in a way that is consistent with collision physics (that is, changes in momentum are not guaranteed to be realistic). Instead of implicitly changing the velocity term, one would need to explicitly control the final velocities of the objects colliding (by changing the recorded position from the previous time step). The two simplest methods for deciding on a new velocity are perfectly elastic and inelastic collisions. A slightly more complicated strategy that offers more control would involve using the coefficient of restitution. == See also == *Courant‚ÄìFriedrichs‚ÄìLewy condition *Energy drift *Symplectic integrator *Leapfrog integration *Beeman's algorithm == Literature == ==External links== *Verlet Integration Demo and Code as a Java Applet *Advanced Character Physics by Thomas Jakobsen *Theory of Molecular Dynamics Simulations ‚Äì bottom of page Category:Numerical differential equations Category:Articles with example C++ code ","title":"Verlet integration"},{"id":"825737","text":"The Arrogant Worms are a Canadian musical comedy trio that parody many musical genres. They are well known for their humorous on-stage banter in addition to their music. ==History== The Arrogant Worms came together in 1991 to do a few spots on campus radio station CFRC in Kingston, Ontario, and quickly moved to doing spots on CBC Radio, particularly on Jack Farr's The Radio Show. Since 1992 the troupe has released fifteen CDs. Their most recent album, The First Farewell Album, was released in November 2016. The Worms have toured in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Each album consists mostly of independent tracks paying homage, always humorously, to different genres and topics. Two exceptions are the 1997 Live Bait and 2003 Semi-Conducted CDs, which are live albums, comprising collections of their best songs. Semi-Conducted is performed with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra. Rock, folk, ballads, country, and children's music all have been genres parodied by the Worms. When not spoofing a particular style of music, the Worms' material pokes fun at various aspects of daily life in Canada with songs like \\"Canada's Really Big\\", \\"Me Like Hockey\\", \\"We are the Beaver\\", \\"I Am Not American\\", and \\"Proud to Be Canadian\\". They have also recorded music videos for three songs: \\"Big Fat Road Manager\\", \\"Carrot Juice Is Murder\\", and \\"The River (River of Snot)\\". The first two of these are included on the Three Worms and an Orchestra DVD. ==MembersCurrent members=== * Trevor Strong - vocals (1991‚ÄìPresent) * Mike McCormick - guitar, vocals (1991‚ÄìPresent) * Chris Patterson - bass, vocals (1995‚ÄìPresent) ===Former members=== * John Whytock - bass (1991-1995) * Steve Wood - bass (1991) ===Additional contributors=== Include (but not limited to): * Andy Thompson - producer, recording engineer, keyboards, backing vocals, and more * Andrew Affleck - bass * Gord Thompson - bass, electric guitar, backing vocals * Adrian Dolan - accordion, fiddle, and mandolin * Tim Readman - guitar (filled in for Mike McCormick in the early 2006 tour and has opened for the Worms many times as well as being their perennial dialect coach) * Mike Ford - bass (filled in for Chris Patterson in March 2009, after Chris' wife gave birth to twins, and appeared on SPACE) ==DiscographyStudio albums=== * The Arrogant Worms (1992) * Russell's Shorts (1994) * C'est Cheese (1995) * Christmas Turkey (1997) * Dirt!

It has one double bond, and is the second simplest member of the alkene class of hydrocarbons. It is a colorless gas with a faint petroleum-like odor ==ProductionSteam cracking=== The dominant technology for producing propylene is steam cracking. The same technology is applied to ethane to ethylene. These two conversions are the #2 and #1 processes in the chemical industry, as judged by their scale. In this process, propane undergoes dehydrogenation. The by-product is hydrogen: :CH3CH2CH3 ‚Üí CH3CH=CH2 \\\\+ H2 The yield of propene is about 85 m%. By-products are usually used as fuel for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Steam cracking is one of the most energy-intensive industrial processes. The feedstock is naphtha or propane, especially in the Middle East, where there is an abundance of propane from oil/gas operations.Ashford‚Äôs Dictionary of Industrial Chemicals, Third edition, 2011, , pages 7766-9 Propene can be separated by fractional distillation from hydrocarbon mixtures obtained from cracking and other refining processes; refinery-grade propene is about 50 to 70%. In the United States shale gas is a major source of propane. ===Olefin conversion technology=== In the Phillips Triolefin or Olefin conversion technology propylene is interconverted with ethylene and 2-butenes. Rhenium and molybdenum catalysts are used: :CH2=CH2 \\\\+ CH3CH=CHCH3 ‚Üí 2 CH2=CHCH3 The technology is founded on an olefin metathesis reaction discovered at Phillips Petroleum Company. Propene yields of about 90 wt% are achieved. Related is the Methanol-to-Olefins/Methanol-to-Propene process. It converts synthesis gas (syngas) to methanol, and then converts the methanol to ethylene and/or propene. The process produces water as by-product. Synthesis gas is produced from the reformation of natural gas or by the steam-induced reformation of petroleum products such as naphtha, or by gasification of coal. ===Fluid catalytic cracking=== High severity fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) uses traditional FCC technology under severe conditions (higher catalyst-to-oil ratios, higher steam injection rates, higher temperatures, etc.) in order to maximize the amount of propene and other light products. A high severity FCC unit is usually fed with gas oils (paraffins) and residues, and produces about 20‚Äì25 m% propene on feedstock together with greater volumes of motor gasoline and distillate byproducts. ===Market and research=== Propene production has remained static at around 35 million tonnes (Europe and North America only) from 2000 to 2008, but it has been increasing in East Asia, most notably Singapore and China. Total world production of propene is currently about half that of ethylene. The use of engineered enzymes has been explored but is of no commercial value. ==Uses== Propene is the second most important starting product in the petrochemical industry after ethylene. It is the raw material for a wide variety of products. Manufacturers of the plastic polypropylene account for nearly two thirds of all demand. Polypropylene end uses include films, fibers, containers, packaging, and caps and closures. Propene is also used for the production of important chemicals such as propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, cumene, butyraldehyde, and acrylic acid. In the year 2013 about 85 million tonnes of propene were processed worldwide. Propene and benzene are converted to acetone and phenol via the cumene process. Overview of the cumene process Propene is also used to produce isopropanol (propan-2-ol), acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and epichlorohydrin. The industrial production of acrylic acid involves the catalytic partial oxidation of propene. Propene is also an intermediate in the one-step propane selective oxidation to acrylic acid. In industry and workshops, propene is used as an alternative fuel to acetylene in Oxy-fuel welding and cutting, brazing and heating of metal for the purpose of bending. It has become a standard in BernzOmatic products and others in MAPP substitutes,For example, \\"MAPP-Pro\\" now that true MAPP gas is no longer available. ==Reactions== Propene resembles other alkenes in that it undergoes addition reactions relatively easily at room temperature. The relative weakness of its double bond explains its tendency to react with substances that can achieve this transformation. Alkene reactions include: 1) polymerization, 2) oxidation, 3) halogenation and hydrohalogenation, 4) alkylation, 5) hydration, 6) oligomerization, and 7) hydroformylation. ===Combustion=== Propene undergoes combustion reactions in a similar fashion to other alkenes. In the presence of sufficient or excess oxygen, propene burns to form water and carbon dioxide. :2 C3H6 \\\\+ 9 O2 ‚Üí 6 CO2 \\\\+ 6 H2O When insufficient oxygen is present for complete combustion, incomplete combustion occurs allowing carbon monoxide and/or soot (carbon) to be formed as well. :C3H6 \\\\+ 2 O2 ‚Üí 3 H2O + 2 C + CO ==Environmental safety== Propene is a product of combustion from forest fires, cigarette smoke, and motor vehicle and aircraft exhaust. It is an impurity in some heating gases. Observed concentrations have been in the range of 0.1-4.8 parts per billion (ppb) in rural air, 4-10.5 ppb in urban air, and 7-260 ppb in industrial air samples. In the United States and some European countries a threshold limit value of 500 parts per million (ppm) was established for occupational (8-hour time- weighted average) exposure. It is considered a volatile organic compound (VOC) and emissions are regulated by many governments, but it is not listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous air pollutant under the Clean Air Act. With a relatively short half-life, it is not expected to bioaccumulate. Propene has low acute toxicity from inhalation. Inhalation of the gas can cause anesthetic effects and at very high concentrations, unconsciousness. However, the asphyxiation limit for humans is about 10 times higher (23%) than the lower flammability level. ==Storage and handling== Since propene is volatile and flammable, precautions must be taken to avoid fire hazards in the handling of the gas. If propene is loaded to any equipment capable of causing ignition, such equipment should be shut down while loading, unloading, connecting or disconnecting. Propene is usually stored as liquid under pressure, although it is also possible to store it safely as gas at ambient temperature in approved containers.Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Fourth edition, 1996, (v.20), page 261 ===Pharmacology=== Propene acts as a central nervous system depressant via allosteric agonism of the GABAA receptor. Excessive exposure may result in sedation and amnesia, progressing to coma and death in a mechanism equivalent to benzodiazepine overdose. Intentional inhalation may also result in death via asphyxiation (sudden inhalant death). ==Occurrence in nature== Propene is detected in the interstellar medium through microwave spectroscopy. On September 30, 2013, NASA also announced that the Cassini orbiter spacecraft, part of the Cassini- Huygens mission, had discovered small amounts of naturally occurring propene in the atmosphere of Titan using spectroscopy. ==See also== * Los Alfaques Disaster * Inhalant abuse * 2014 Kaohsiung gas explosions * 2020 Houston explosion ==References== Category:Alkenes Category:Monomers Category:Commodity chemicals Category:Petrochemicals Category:GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators Category:Gases Category:Allyl compounds ","title":"Propene"},{"id":"825749","text":" : For the USAF unmanned Quail drone aircraft, see ADM-20 Quail. The IMCO CallAir A-9 is a small agricultural aircraft that first flew in 1962, a development of the company's previous successful crop-dusters. It is typical of aircraft of its type - a single-seat aircraft with a low wing incorporating spraying gear. ==Design and development== Following the purchase of Call Aircraft Company, who had built the CallAir Model A series of light utility and agricultural aircraft, by Intermountain Manufacturing Company (IMCO) in 1962, IMCO produced a new agricultural derivative of the Callair, the CallAir A-9. Production of the new aircraft started in 1963.Taylor 1965, pp. 246‚Äì247. Like the earlier CallAir aircraft, the A-9 is a single-engined monoplane with a braced low wing. It is of mixed construction, with a fabric-covered steel- tube fuselage structure and a wood-and-fabric wing. The pilot sits behind the chemical hopper, and the cockpit is enclosed by two removable, bottom-hinged doors that form the left and right side windows. The aircraft is powered by a single Lycoming O-540 flat-six piston engine.\\"A-9 Owners Manual: Serials 1048, 1111, 1117 & Up\\" . Retrieved 23 February 2013. Later, some A-9s have been adapted for glider towing operations. IMCO was in turn purchased by Rockwell International in 1966, which built the plane under its Aero Commander division before shifting production to Mexico in 1971, under a joint venture there called AAMSA. Production continued until 1984. ==Variants== ;A-9 :Original variant, powered by a 235 hp (175 kW) Lycoming O-540-B2B5.
