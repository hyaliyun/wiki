Previously, he was the Bishop of Essen and, prior to that, was an Auxiliary Bishop of Trier. Since 2013, he has been a member of the Congregation for Bishops.  Early life and education  Genn was born on 6 March 1950 in the town of Burgbrohl, which is located in the Ahrweiler district of the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. He was raised on a farm in Wassenach and graduated from the Kurf√ºrst-Salentin gymnasium in Andernach in 1969. Between 1969 and 1974, he undertook the study of theology at the University of Trier and the University of Regensburg. Finally, on 29 June 1985, he received his Ph.D. in theology from the University of Trier. He wrote his doctoral thesis on St. Augustine.  Career  Genn speaking at the 100th Katholikentag in Leipzig  Priestly ministry  Genn was ordained a priest on 11 July 1976 in Trier by Bishop Bernhard Stein. Upon being made a priest, he was appointed a curate of the Holy Cross Church in Bad Kreuznach, a position he held for two years. In 1978, he was made the subregens (assistant head) of the diocesan seminary of Trier, where he remained until 1994. In 1985, he was made the seminary's spiritual director. From 1994 to 1997, Genn was a permanent lecturer of the theological faculty of the University of Trier. Following this, he was made the regens of the St. Lambert House of Study in the Burg Lantershofen.  Episcopal ministry  On 16 April 1999, Genn was appointed an Auxiliary Bishop of Trier and simultaneously the Titular Bishop of Uzalis by Pope John Paul II. He was consecrated a bishop in the Cathedral of Trier on 30 May 1999 and was charged as vicar for the Visitation District of Saarland. Bishop Hermann Josef Spital was his principal consecrator, while Bishops Franz-Josef Hermann Bode and Alfred Kleinermeilert were his co-consecrators. On 4 April 2003, he was then transferred by Pope John Paul II with his appointment as the third Bishop of Essen. He was enthroned in the diocese on 6 July 2003. Genn was appointed the seventy-sixth Bishop of M√ºnster on 19 December 2008 by Pope Benedict XVI after being elected by the cathedral chapter, succeeding Reinhard Lettmann. He was enthroned in the diocese on 29 March 2009. On 21 August 2010, he was awarded honorary citizenship of Wassenach. As part of a major political shake-up of the Congregation for Bishops on 16 December 2013, Pope Francis appointed Genn as a member of the congregation, succeeding Cardinal Joachim Meisner.  Coat of arms  Upon being made a bishop, Genn took up an episcopal coat of arms. Upon being made Bishop of M√ºnster, he adopted a new coat of arms. On his current coat of arms, the yellow and red striped fields on the top left and bottom right of the shield are taken from the Diocese of M√ºnster's coat of arms. The eagle in the top right field is indicative of Genn's hometown of Wassenach, as an eagle is present in its coat of arms, and is a remnant of his previous coats of arms as Bishop of Essen and Auxiliary Bishop of Trier. Moreover, the eagle relates to his Latin episcopal motto, , which is taken from . The seven heads of grain in the lower left field reference Genn's peasant background. However, their number also symbolizes the fullness of life and believers of God who gather from all directions with a hunger and thirst for life.

It is one of the largest producers of custom wall decorations in the world, with the headquarters in Cologne. History In 2004, brothers Daniel and Philipp M√ºhlbauer from Cologne began to work on an idea for wall decorations. They found business partners in Dafen Village near Shenzhen, famous for the mass production of replicas of oil paintings. However, realizing that the market was already saturated, they decided to turn to people who wanted to have their own pictures on their walls. They founded Picanova in 2006. In 2008, the DuMont publishing house became a partner. Ventech, a French venture capital firm, announced in 2013 that it invested several million euros in Picanova. Picanova's sales in 2014 amounted to 17,9 million euros, with a profit of EUR 1.1 million. The companies United Arts (myfoto), fotofox and Bestcanvas became part of Picanova. The company received the 2015 Eco Internet Award from the government of North Rhine-Westphalia for special achievements in digital economy. In March 2017, the company had 600 employees worldwide and managed 40 online shops in 25 countries. It produced up to 100,000 products per day. Production and offer The production plants are in four locations: Cologne, producing for European and Asian markets; Miami for the American market; a wood factory in Riga for canvas frames and other wooden items; and Shenzhen. Picanova first created an online platform, \\"mein Bild.de\\", which made it possible for users to print their own photos on canvasses to be hanged on the wall. With time, their offer widened to include not only surfaces and frames of different materials, but also pillows, mobile phone covers, and various other objects to be printed on. Services are offered under different domains in different countries. For example, the French site is called \\"photo-sur- toile.fr\\". Picanova's platforms \\"Creame\\" and \\"This is a Limited Edition\\" cooperate with artists whose illustrations customers can print. The company has also developed a 3D scanner allowing customers to physically capture and print small figures. Picanova's platform \\"Monetize.ly\\" is intended for celebrities from sports, film, show business, and the Internet. They can upload their pictures for their fans to print them. The Picanova group includes Yincool, a Chinese fashion company. Since 2017, Picanova has been the general sponsor of Yincool Fashion Weekend, which gathers European and Asian designers in J≈´rmala, Latvia.

CAINE Linux stands for computer aided investigative environment and is an Italian Linux live distribution. Actual Project Manager is Giovanni \\"Nanni\\" Bassetti. It is as a digital forensics project started in 2008.  Purpose  CAINE is a professional open source forensic platform that integrates software tools as modules along with powerful scripts in a graphical interface environment. Its operational environment was designed with the intent to provide the forensic professional all the tools required to perform the digital forensic investigate process (preservation, collection, examination and analysis). CAINE is a live Linux distribution so it can be booted from removable media (flash drive) or from an optical disk and run in memory. It can also be installed onto a physical or virtual system. In Live mode, CAINE can operate on data storage objects without having to boot up a supporting operating system. The latest version 9.0 can boot on UEFI/UEFI+Secure and Legacy BIOS allowing CAINE to be used on information systems that boot older operating systems (e.g. Windows NT) and newer platforms (Linux, Windows 10).  Requirements  CAINE is based on Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit, using Linux kernel 4.4.0-97. CAINE system requirements to run as a live disc are similar to Ubuntu 16.04 (2 GHz dual core processor or better; 2 GB system memory). It can run on a physical system or in a virtual machine environment such as VMware Workstation.  Supported platforms  The CAINE Linux distribution has numerous software applications, scripts and libraries that can be used in a graphical or command line environment to perform forensic tasks. CAINE can perform data analysis of data objects created on Microsoft Windows, Linux and some Unix systems. One of the key forensic features in version 9.0 is that it sets all block devices by default to read-only mode. Write-blocking is a critical methodology to ensure that disks are not subject to writing operations by the operating system or forensic tools. This ensures that attached data objects are not modified, which would negatively impact digital forensic preservation.  Tools  CAINE provides software tools that support database, memory, forensic and network analysis. File system image analysis of NTFS, FAT/ExFAT, Ext2, Ext3, HFS and ISO 9660 is possible via command line and through the graphic desktop. Examination of Linux, Microsoft Windows and some Unix platforms is built-in. CAINE can import disk images in raw (dd) and expert witness/advanced file format. These may be obtained from using tools that are included in CAINE or from another platform such as EnCase or the Forensic Tool Kit. Some of the tools included with the CAINE Linux distribution include: * The Sleuth Kit ‚Äì open source command line tools that support forensic inspection of disk volume and file system analysis. * Autopsy ‚Äì open source digital forensics platform that supports forensic analysis of files, hash filtering, keyword search, email and web artifacts. Autopsy is the graphical interface to The Sleuth Kit. * RegRipper ‚Äì open source tool, written in Perl, extracts/parses information (keys, values, data) from the Registry database for data analysis. * Tinfoleak ‚Äì open source tool for collecting detailed Twitter intelligence analysis. * Wireshark ‚Äì supports interactive collection of network traffic and non real- time analysis of data packet captures (*.pcap). * PhotoRec ‚Äì supports recovery of lost files from hard disk, digital camera and optical media. * Fsstat ‚Äì displays file system statistical information about an image or storage object.

He has served as Director of the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences since 2013, and was Director of the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology (SIBCB) from 2004 to 2009. He was also a member of the 12th National People's Congress. His research focus is the Wnt signaling pathway.  Biography  Li Lin was born in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province in 1961. After graduating from Nanjing University in 1983 with a bachelor's degree in biochemistry, he entered the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry to study under Professor Xu Genjun, an enzyme specialist, and earned his Ph.D. in 1989. At the time, scientific research in China was poorly funded, and his research was limited by primitive facilities and supplies. He often went to slaughterhouses and wet markets himself to buy chicken and pig livers for his experiments. From 1990 to 1992, Li worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the State University of New York, Stony Brook. He returned to the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry (now Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, SIBCB) afterwards, at a time when most Chinese students and researchers chose to stay abroad for the better living standards and research facilities. He was promoted to full professor in 1993. His research is focused on the mechanisms of the Wnt signaling pathway. Li served as Deputy Director of the SIBCB from 2002 to 2004, and Director from 2004 to 2009. Since 2013, he has been Director of the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, of which SIBCB is a constituent institute. He is an editor of many scientific journals.  Honours and awards  Li has won many awards, including the CAS Young Scientist Award (1993), National Outstanding Young Scientist Award (1995), Outstanding Young Scholar Award by Hong Kong Qiushi Foundation (1996), and China Youth Science and Technology Award (1997). He was elected as an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2011. He was also elected as a member of the 11th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and a member of the 12th National People's Congress.

Biography The band's first album, Blooztown, was released in 2000 on Nerus Records and re-released in 2001 on Biograph. The album was recorded with Johnny Gale (Cyndi Lauper, Aaron Carter, M2M, Loudon Wainwright III, Dave Mason, Jules Shear, Hank Ballard, The Ramones, Joan Osborne, James Brown, Aaron Neville), Bobby Forester, Bernard Purdie and special guest Ray Alexander (on two songs). Their second album, Angel in the Shadows, released in 2003, was recorded with Gale, Richard Crooks (Dr. John, David Bromberg and Bob Dylan), Seth Glassman (James Brown, Paul McCartney, Aaron Neville, Brian McKnight, Jill Sobule, J.D Souther, Bobby Womack, Dr. John, Hall and Oates, Cyndi Lauper, Kenny Rogers, Carole King), Kevin Rymer, Murray Weinstock (The Manhattan Transfer, Esther Phillips, Richie Havens, Don Covay and Buddy Miles), Greg \\"Clutch\\" Reilly, and Michael Snyder. Following the album's release the band undertook its first tour of the United Kingdom, with UK band Groove Juice as the support act. They also played the Eel Pie Club with Storm Warning as support. In 2006 they released a live album, Live at Stonybrook University, which comprises songs from their first two album together with a number of original unrecorded songs. The album was recorded live on November 28, 2005 at the University Cafe at Stony Brook University and features Alexander, Rymer (keys), Mike Porter (bass) and Jay Sharkey (drums). Its release was followed by another UK tour. The band's next album in 2009, Pale Rider, featured the live band (with Ed \\"The Hat\\" D'Alessio on drums). It was also the first time the band had recorded with a horn section, on the track \\"Miss Catherine\\". Hitman undertook its first European tour after this release. In 2010, Alt-Strum Productions licensed \\"Two Minute Warning\\" from the Angel in the Shadows to be an add-on for the Rock Band 3 video game. The band's fifth album, Blues Enough, released in 2013, featured the live band with the new drummer, Guy LaFountaine. It also featured a horn section consisting of Michael Snyder on all saxes, Eric Altarac on trumpet, and Al Alpert on trombone. Neil Alexander performed on harmonica on two cuts, \\"Life's Too Short\\" and \\"Blues Enough\\". Additionally, a female backup vocal section was used, composed of Joanne Alexander and Victoria Anyah. The Hitman Blues Band resumed touring in the UK, but brought over the entire American band without the female backup singers. However, in 2014 they added Joanne Alexander and Nancy Hampton to the live lineup, singing backup. In 2015, \\"Trouble On The Line\\" and \\"I'm Coming For You\\", both from the Pale Rider album, were used in the film, Ghostline (the former in the beginning of the movie, and the latter during closing credits). Their sixth album, The World Moves On, released in 2016, featured Alexander (guitar/vocals), Kevin Bents (keyboards), Mike Porter (bass), La Fontaine (drums), and Mickey Vitale (tenor saxophone) and Nick Clifford (baritone saxophone). It has been described as a \\"celebration of the traditions of the Delta Blues mixed with the glorious groove of the Memphis and Chicago blues.\\" Additional tours of the UK and France followed, using the American lineup. However, in 2017 John Kelly replaced Vitale on tenor saxophone. In June 2017, Hitman was featured on the cover of Blues in Britain.

They are a Pashtun tribe indigenous to northern Kandahar province of Afghanistan. There was little ethnographic literature on the Miana beyond the observations of some 19th and early 20th century British civil and military personnel prior to the research of Zahir Khan Advocate. Miana is related to Qais Abdul Rasheed through his grandson whose name was also Miana. Miyanishin District is a mountainous area of Kandahar Province. Miana are part of greater Pashtun family called Sarbani which also includes Durrani, Tarin, etc. History The origin of the Miyana may be connected with Hephthalites, who had a large nomadic confederation that included present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan in the 5th-6th centuries AD, as well as with Scythians, who are known to have settled where most Pashtuns live today.

Sarban's father was Qais Abdul Rasheed who is considered the founding father of Pathan or Afghan nation. Qais Abdul Rasheed Qais Abdul Rasheed was known to be the pioneer of Pakhtuns. From Sara, Qias Abdul Rasheed had three sons named Sarban, Garghashti, and Batni. Sarban is the pioneer of Sarbani Pukhtoons. He had two sons named Shrakhboon and Khrashboon. Shrakhboon had six sons named Urmur, Bareech, Tareen, Miana, Babar, and Sheerani. Western View Accounts of earliest contact of the Miana tribe with the British are not known, but the British became familiar with these peoples as diplomatic relations between the Durrani Empire and the British Raj increased. Mianas living around the vicinity of Multan migrated to the British protectorate princely state of Bahawalpur to avoid persecution as forces of Ranjit Singh tighten their grip on Punjab. According to gazettes of British Raj during 1800s, Miana are Afghans of Azeri or Iranian origin.

Previously, he represented Veracruz as a federal deputy in the LXIII Legislature of the Mexican Congress. Early life and education Garc√≠a was born in the Veracruz state capital of Xalapa and received a degree in mechanical and electrical engineering from the Universidad Veracruzana in 1991, followed by master's degrees from the Instituto Polit√©cnico Nacional and the University of Manchester. In 2004, he obtained a doctoral degree from the Hamburg University of Technology. Garc√≠a has taught at the Escuela Normal Superior Veracruzana Doctor Manuel Su√°rez Trujillo and the Universidad Veracruzana.  Political career  Garc√≠a's first political experience was in the Mexican Socialist Party (PMS), where he became a follower of party leader Heberto Castillo. When the PMS was essentially replaced by the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) in 1989, he remained with the party as a representative and national councilor. In 2013, he became one of MORENA's founding members. In 2015, Garc√≠a successfully ran for the Chamber of Deputies for the LXIII Legislature from Veracruz's tenth district, covering voters in Xalapa. He initially served on the Justice Commission, an assignment he left when he took leave from the federal legislature in order to run for Governor of Veracruz in 2016. Competing alone for MORENA, Garc√≠a garnered 26.39 percent of the vote, finishing third behind candidates H√©ctor Yunes Landa and winner Miguel √Ångel Yunes Linares. After the failed gubernatorial bid, Garc√≠a returned to the Chamber of Deputies with just one secretarial commission post, on the Navy Commission. In order to align itself with the federal electoral calendar, Veracruz held gubernatorial elections again in 2018, with Garc√≠a running as the candidate for the Juntos Haremos Historia coalition, headlined by MORENA. The 2018 gubernatorial bid bore fruit, with exit polls on election night putting him ahead of Miguel √Ångel Yunes M√°rquez, the son of Yunes Linares, and the other candidates in the race.

It was released on June 21, 2004, by Callaway Arts & Entertainment in over 110 countries and 38 different languages, including a Braille edition. The book contains a moral tale and was inspired by a 300 year-old story by rabbi Baal Shem Tov, that Madonna had heard from her Kabbalah teacher. The premise was set in a small, 18th century town in Eastern Europe, and the story talks about how everyone has the ability to open the gates of heaven, however unworthy one is deemed to be. The cover art and the images inside were painted by Russian illustrator Gennady Spirin who chose Baroque painting as inspiration for crafting the characters and the scenery. Like her previous endeavors, Madonna promoted the release by appearing on talk show and reading to children at a hospital in London. Critics gave mixed review of the book, with reviews being mostly negative about Madonna's writing but praised Spirin's illustrations. Three weeks after its release, Yakov and the Seven Thieves debuted at number seven on The New York Times Best Seller list in the category for Children's Picture books. Synopsis A cobbler called Yakov and his wife Olga are frightened that their gravely ill son Mikhhail is dying. They hear about a man of healing who lives in the last house of their village and Yakov goes to him for guidance. The man refuses Yakov's money, instead clarifies that if he can save Yakov's son, the cobbler can repay by making a pair of shoes for his grandson. The next day, Yakov visited the man only to be told that when he had prayed, the gates of heaven would not open. The distressed cobbler begged him to try yet one more time. The healer asked his grandson to go into the village and find all the thieves, pickpockets and criminals, and bring them back to the house. They included the thieves Vladimir the Villain who could bend metal and punch holes through stones, Boris the Barefoot Midget who snatched the purse of old ladies, Ivan the Arsonist, Petra the Pickpocket, Stinky Pasha and a large host of ne'er-do- wells. With the healer's direction, the thieves all got on their knees and started to pray. A miracle occurred and the prayers of the men, who previously robbed by opening gates, helped to open the gates of heaven and Yakov's son was healed. The next day, Yakov came with a new pair of shoes for the grandson and declared that Mikhail was alive and well. It was the prayers of the gang of crooks that made a difference. Background and development In 2003, American singer Madonna signed a contract with Callaway Arts & Entertainment for a series of five children's books. She explained that each book dealt \\"with issues that all children confront... Hopefully there is a lesson that will help kids turn painful or scary situations into learning experiences\\". The first two releases were The English Roses (September 2003), and Mr. Peabody's Apples (November 2003). Both debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list. Joe D'Angelo from MTV News confirmed that the third book would be titled Yakov and the Seven Thieves. Madonna was again inspired by a 300 year-old story by rabbi Baal Shem Tov that she had heard from her Kabbalah teacher, and wanted to share the \\"essence\\" of it. \\"We must never forget that hidden behind a large amount of darkness is a large amount of light,\\" the singer wrote in the preface.Yakov and the Seven Thieves, 2004, Acknowledgement, p. III According to the press release, the premise was set in a small, 18th century town in Eastern Europe and was written for readers aged six and up, with the book manufactured in a 32-page jacketed hardcover. The initial release date for Yakov and the Seven Thieves was set for April 2004, but publisher Nicholas Callaway confirmed that the book would be released on June 21, 2004, in over 110 countries and 38 different languages, including a Braille edition. Although Callaway published it, the release was distributed through 42 agencies, including Gallimard Jeunesse in France, Penguin Books in the United Kingdom and the United States, and Hanser Verlag in Germany. Madonna promoted the book by appearing on ABC News on June 16, 2004, where she dedicated the release to \\"naughty children everywhere\\" and spoke about the power of praying according to her. While on the Re-Invention World Tour of 2004, Madonna visited London's Great Ormond Street Hospital, where her daughter Lourdes read an excerpt from the book to a group of ailing children. The cover art and the images inside were painted by Russian illustrator Gennady Spirin. This was Spirin's first time working with a contemporary author and story, and was initially uncomfortable with the mayhem surrounding Madonna. He clarified that the ideas given to him were \\"clear\\" and \\"style parameters were set\\", which resulted in crafting the characters \\"amazingly quickly\\". Since the story was set in 18th century Europe, Spirin chose Baroque painting as inspiration since it made the book \\"dressier, but at the same time preserves the dramatic element and the psychological characteristics of each of the characters\\". Critical and commercial reception While on the Re- Invention World Tour (pictured), Madonna appeared at Great Ormond Street Hospital for a reading session from the book. Three weeks after its release, Yakov and the Seven Thieves debuted at number seven on The New York Times Best Seller list in the category for Children's Picture books. The sales fell drastically, as observed by Edward Wyatt from The New York Times, and it sold just 27,000 copies according to Nielsen BookScan. This was much less from the 321,000 copies sold of The English Roses and the 127,000 copies of Mr. Peabody's Apples. Positive review came from The Des Moines Register with critic Maria Sudekum Fisher complimenting the \\"redemption arc\\" of the storyline. The Children's BBC did not find any \\"weak bits\\" in the book and listed the introduction of the thieves as well as the illustrations as highlight. Canada.com found Yakov to be the best among Madonna's three released books, feeling that \\"the story moves along nicely and gets its message about redemption across without being too preachy. it's also appropriately written for its target audience\\". An article in The Economist felt that had any unknown author released Yakov and the Seven Thieves, it would not have received much promotion. The review noted that the message in the story was distinct, describing it as \\"a more overtly religious message than is normally encountered in children's picture books\\" and found the moral as \\"purely medieval Catholicism\\". The critic added that \\"for all the ecumenical confusion, the message is heartfelt and the delivery straightforward. [Madonna] has a vivid and direct writing style‚Äîpresumably the product of two decades of song-writing experience.\\" The Publishers Weekly complimented Spirin's illustrations and Madonna's comic writing while describing the seven thieves, but criticized her \\"soapbox approach\\" in telling a witty story. The review also noted Spirin adding minute details to the images, including \\"the smallest features of 18th-century European town life: cobbler's nails, brass drawer-pulls, feather pens, children's toys\\". Deirdre Donahue from USA Today also complimented Spirin's paintings, but was critical of the story, calling it \\"dreary and inappropriate\\" as well as \\"lackluster and verbose\\". She criticized the fact that Spirin's name was not present on the book cover art and felt that Yakov and the Seven Thieves was the \\"worst\\" of Madonna's three published children's books. \\"Dying children, prayers, criminals praying to open the gates of heaven. It's positively Grimm. Yakov will either bore or frighten children,\\" Donahue concluded. Tim Adams from The Observer compared the release to the work of Hans Christian Andersen, but added that the \\"triteness of the story and the easiness of the moralising is more than redeemed by the excellence of the illustrations\\". Reviewing the book for Tablet, Ayelet Waldman found the moral of the story as \\"unsatisfying and somehow ill-constructed\\", as well as \\"half-baked\\". She complimented Spirin's paintings describing them as \\"complex and multilayered\\" like Renaissance paintings, but found it odd that the renderings were not Jewish, and instead the illustrator gave a Tudor town. Waldman believed that Yakov and the Seven Thieves would become \\"a staple of Hanukkah gift-giving. It's a muddled and simplistic story [...] but the illustrations are lovely and the title sounds like those of all the other boring Jewish storybooks.\\" Jane Doonan from Times Educational Supplement listed the artwork as the \\"best reason\\" for buying the book, since she felt that the \\"internal logic of the story doesn't bear inspection, and the mawkishness and moralising is unappealing\\".

Curt Heinrich Dathe (7 November 1910- 6 January 1991) was a German zoologist best known for being the director of the Berlin Zoo where he helped in popularizing animal conservation and worked on the successful captive breeding of a range of animals including numerous species of birds. As a youth he joined to become a member of the NDSAP, the Nazi party, and regretted it in a posthumous biography. He received the national prize of the GDR in 1965. A school in Berlin is named after him. Dathe was born in Reichenbach where his father was an office manager. In the 1930s he studied zoology, botany and geology at the University of Leipzig. He was interested in research and travel. His early work was as an assistant at the Leipzig zoological gardens under Karl Max Schneider and he worked on a doctoral thesis on the male reproductive organs of guinea pigs and other rodents. He became a deputy director of Leipzig zoo. In 1932 he joined the NSDAP due to feelings of patriotism. During the second world war he was injured in one arm. At the end of the war he was held as a British prisoner. During this time he contemplated suicide but was inspired when he saw a woodchat shrike. He gave ornithological lectures to the other prisoners. When he returned to Leipzig he was not allowed to work due to his former party membership. He worked in a series of small jobs, helping on the market, and at one point employed to imitate different bird songs on the radio. From 1950 he allowed to teach at Leipzig University. 1950 was also the year in which he was hired by Leipzig Zoo. Between 1955 and 1957 he served as acting director. Dathe helped rebuild the Berlin zoo after the war. He was appointed director for the zoo and he served for more than three decades during which time he appeared regularly in radio and TV shows making him popular. In his memoirs Dathe downplayed his association with the Nazi party. He claimed that he joined the party before it became politically powerful. Dathe however was a director of the chapter (Ortsgruppe) at Leipzig zoo that helped in grassroots activities. Dathe died of cancer in 1991. His grave in Friedrichsfelde is specially honored by the city of Berlin. His sons Holger and Falk are also well known zoologists. Heinrich-Dathe-Platz and Dathe- promenade at the Tierpark metro station are named after him. A memorial plaque was installed in the elephant house at the zoo in 2012. A school in Friedrichshain was renamed after him as the Dathe-Gymnasium but it was criticized on the basis of Dathe's NSDAP membership but this was debated and finally retained by a committee.

She is a former member of the Japanese idol group Nogizaka46. Biography It≈ç was born on February 20, 1996 in Osaka, Japan to a fashion designer mother and a graphic designer father. She began her singing career in 2011 by successfully auditioning for the first generation of Nogizaka46, an idol group created as the official rival of AKB48. As a Nogizaka46 member, It≈ç appeared in several albums, concerts, short films, music videos, and television shows, including the million-selling singles \\"Influencer\\" and \\"Itsuka Dekiru kara Ky≈ç Dekiru\\". In 2017, at the group's sold-out first Tokyo Dome concert, It≈ç performed for the last time as a Nogizaka46 member. It≈ç's acting career began while she was still a member of Nogizaka46. She had a minor part in the 2013 movie Bad Boys J, but her first major film role was in Eyes, an adaptation of a story by Ring author Koji Suzuki. In 2017 she played a supporting role in Asahinagu, an adaptation of the manga of the same name, for which she had to learn how to use the naginata. While in Nogizaka46, It≈ç art directed and styled several of her individual performance videos, which were included in bonus versions of singles and DVDs. Shortly before her graduation from Nogizaka46, It≈ç's first solo art exhibition was held in October 2017 at GALLERY X BY PARCO and featured photographs of fellow Nogizaka46 members, a room filled with objects meant to represent the contents of It≈ç's brain, and an original short film playing on a loop. In 2017 she also filmed her first solo commercial, for the app „É™„ÇØ„Éù (\\"requpo\\"), based on a character she created and played in a Nogizaka46 music video. In 2018, It≈ç's photobook √âtranger, for which she styled the clothing, was published. She was also selected to be the image model for the MOOSIC LAB 2018 music and film festival. In 2019, It≈ç was cast in her first post-Nogizaka46 film role, winning a supporting role in Kakegurui ‚Äì Compulsive Gambler, a film adaptation of the Homura Kawamoto manga of the same name.

The \\"Q\\" area was painted black on a white background, while the numbers were painted white on a black background. Starting on 1 July 1955, plates were manufactured in the format aaa-nnn with white text on a black base.

Queensland ‚Äì Sunshine State in green-on-white, as issued between 1977 and 2001 Once the aaa-nnn format between NAA-000 and PZZ-999 was exhausted, Queensland reversed the order to nnn-aaa, starting 1 July 1977. These plates were issued with green text on a white reflective background and bore the slogan Queensland ‚Äì Sunshine State. As such Queensland became the second jurisdiction in Australia to issue sloganised plates. This series started at 000¬∑NAA and spanned through to 999¬∑PZZ. After exhausting this initial allocation, in late 1987, Queensland began issuing combinations from 000¬∑AAA onwards. On 28 September 2001, the last plate with green text was manufactured‚Äî999¬∑GKJ. Queensland ‚Äì The Smart State in maroon-on-white, as issued between 2001 and 2013 Queensland ‚Äì Sunshine State in maroon-on-white, as issued since 2001 In October 2001, Queensland's then Premier, Peter Beattie announced in the state would be switching to maroon-on-white plates embossed with the slogan Queensland ‚Äì The Smart State. The Premier stated that idea for the change came from a member of the public. This was to demonstrate the state government's efforts to promote education, research and development within Queensland. Due to backlash from tourism operators and the public, Beattie rescinded his decision on 30 October, instead allowing motorists to select between either the old or new slogans with maroon text. However, it adopted as policy that all government owned motor vehicles, including privately plated vehicles use The Smart State slogan, except where the Premier otherwise agrees. The first of the new maroon plates were manufactured on 14 November 2001. This started at 000¬∑GKK for the Sunshine State plates and 000¬∑HAA for The Smart State versions. The Smart State slogan was allocated the combinations 000-HAA to 999-HFU, 000-HOY to 999-HQQ, 000-JAA to 999-JDZ, 000-JKA to 999-JKT, 000-KAA to 999-KAZ, 000-KFA to 999-KGK, 000-KOA to 999-KPD, 000-KWS to 999-KXG, 000-LFA to 999-LFU, 000-LOA to 999-LOZ, 000-LZI to 999-LZZ, and 000-MAA to 999-MFM. All others have Sunshine State slogans. In late May 2010, after 999¬∑MZZ was reached, the series skipped to 000¬∑RAA, due to standard-issue plates in the 000-NAA to 999-PZZ remaining in circulation, and 000-QAA to 999-QZZ combinations being used and reserved for large trailers and government vehicles. On 22 April 2012, the recently elected Campbell Newman-led LNP government announced that it would stop manufacturing The Smart State plates as a cost-cutting measure, noting that nine out of 10 customers chose the Sunshine State slogan. Starting on 19 August 2013, limited edition Queenslander! ‚Äì 8 in a Row slogan plates starting at 000¬∑UAA were issued to celebrate the recent eighth consecutive State of Origin win for Queensland. In July 2014, when the combination 999¬∑TZZ was reached, the 000-UAA to 999-UZZ series were skipped, recommencing from 000¬∑VAA. The U-series plates are reserved for large trailers and special applications, such as the limited edition Queenslander! ‚Äì 8 in a Row plates.

Personalised plates  Tropical Queensland personalised plate Queensland personalised plate PPQ ‚Äì Personalised Plates Queensland is a personalised plate product of the Queensland Transport and Main Roads Department and they have a dedicated website in use. Queensland motorists have a choice of nearly 100 different types of personalised plates. Personalised plates are very popular amongst Queenslanders and often sell for a premium via classifieds or various online portals such as eBay. In addition, PPQ offers customers 'retro' plates, which are essentially general-issue plates that may be retained if customers change vehicles. As vintage general issue 'Q' plates, white-on-black plates and green-on-white plates will eventually attract a relatively high price among classic car collectors and restorers, PPQ has made retro plates essentially non-transferable; that is, they may be attached to many different vehicles, but the listed owner(s) must stay the same with each registration and can only be transferred to direct relations. Formats used are nn-aaa, aaa-nn, nnn-aaa or aaa-nnn, Qaa-nnZ and Qaa-nnY (for Euro combinations) and custom combinations as cccccc. 7-letter combinations are auctioned off from time to time and for limited periods between 2007 and 2009, PPQ made 7-letter combinations available for sale online. Queensland plates are manufactured by LicenSys in Brisbane. * September 2010 ‚Äì PPQ released 7 letter/number combinations that were not already issued for a limited period of 7 days at the fixed price of $2995 but by 2012 it is now permanent. * November 2010 ‚Äì PPQ launched the Q Signature Series plates: Qaann * March 2011 - PPQ launched the NRL footy plates range covering all of these NRL teams and incorporates Qld based NRL teams.

It was formed in 2005 from the merger of two older psychoanalytic organizations, the Los Angeles Psychoanalytic Society and Institute (LAPSI) and the Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute and Society (SCPIS), which had been founded as a single organization in the 1940s and then split around 1950. History of Psychoanalytic Institutes in Los Angeles Psychoanalytic study groups are documented in the Los Angeles area from the late 1920s, with influence from the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis and the Topeka Psychoanalytic Institute \\"Los Angeles Psychoanalytic Society and Institute.\\" International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis. Encyclopedia.com. Accessed: 31 Aug. 2019 . The Los Angeles society was initially associated with the California Psychoanalytic Society in San Francisco, which later became the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Society and Institute after the Los Angeles group became independent. The first formal psychoanalytic institute in Southern California was founded in 1946 as the Los Angeles Psychoanalytic Institute, with key figures including Ernst Simmel, Otto Fenichel, May Romm,\\"DR. MAY E. ROMM, PIONEER IN FIELD OF PSYCHIATRY\\" New York Times 1977-Oct-19 https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1977/10/19/92276236.html?pageNumber=31 Frances Deri, and Hanna Heilborn.\\"Los Angeles Psychoanalytic Society and Institute.\\" International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis. Encyclopedia.com. Accessed: 31 Aug. 2019 . Early members included psychoanalysts who had left Europe to escape Nazi persecution and the turmoil of the Second World War. Like psychoanalytic institutes and societies in some other American cities, the Los Angeles Institute and its successor organizations split several times over the second half of the 20th century. One major source of schismogenesis was the conflict between the dominant ego psychology/neo-Freudian position and increasing interest in the ideas of Melanie Klein and Wilfred Bion, and later of Self Psychology and other developments. Another major factor was disagreement over the role of non-physician psychoanalysts.\\"Splits in Psychoanalysis.\\" International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis. Encyclopedia.com. 31 Aug. 2019 . In Europe, where psychoanalysis began, Freud himself was trained as a physician and his ideas were very influential among many psychiatrists and other physicians. However, some early figures in Freud's movement included non-physicians, such as his daughter Anna Freud, and he defended the notion of non-physician psychoanalysts in his essay on lay analysis. A number of later prominent European psychoanalytic thinkers such as Erik Eriksen and Harry Guntrip were also non-physicians. In the United States, the American Psychoanalytic Association was a nearly all-physician organization for many years, and opposed the expansion of psychoanalysis to non-physicians.\\"International Psychoanalytical Association.\\" International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis. Encyclopedia.com. 31 Aug. 2019 . This played out in a number of conflicts among American psychoanalytic institutes and societies, as psychologists and some other academics and clinicians also wanted psychoanalytic training and to practice psychoanalysis. (This ultimately resulted in a lawsuit in the 1980s, and American psychoanalytic institutes have all admitted non-physician candidates since at least 1992).Robert Pear (1992-Aug-19) \\"M.D.'s Make Room for Others In Ranks of Psychoanalysts\\" New York Times. https://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/19/health/md- s-make-room-for-others-in-ranks-of-psychoanalysts.html In 1950, the Los Angeles Institute split over the issue of non-physician analysts. The Institute for Psychoanalytic Medicine of Southern California broke away in that year, later changing its name to the Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute and Society (SCPIS, sometimes affectionately pronounced \\"skippy\\"). SCPIS focused on physician members, while the group that retained the name of Los Angeles Psychoanalytic Society and Institute (LAPSI) began to allow training of psychologists. It also pioneered [research psychoanalysts],http://www.mbc.ca.gov/Applicants/Psychoanalysts/ individuals with advanced degrees in social sciences, humanities, law, or some other fields who wished to complement their academic and professional work with psychoanalytic training. During the 1970s through early 1990s, several other psychoanalytic institutes were founded in the greater Los Angeles in response to differences of opinion over the direction in which psychoanalysis should go. The Los Angeles Institute and Society for Psychoanalytic Studies (LAISPS), an organization of psychologists and educators, was founded in 1970. From the beginning, it offered training to a wider variety of health professionals than just physicians and PhD-level psychologists. Kleinian analysts had existed within both SCIPI and LAPSI but as minority viewpoints in both organizations. The Psychoanalytic Center of California (PCC) was established in the 1980s with a specific focus on the works of Melanie Klein and her associates; it joined the International Psychoanalytical Association in 1989.\\"Los Angeles Psychoanalytic Society and Institute.\\" International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis. Encyclopedia.com. Accessed: 31 Aug. 2019 . Another source of controversy, similar in some ways to the earlier impact of Kleinian-Bionin theories, was the emergence of Self Psychology from the writings of Heinz Kohut and his interlocutors in the 1960s and 1970s. Analysts devoted to self psychology and intersubjective approaches formed the Institute of Contemporary Psychoanalysis in 1990. Robert Stolorow, one of its founders,https://icpla.edu/members/ was a major figure in intersubjective psychoanalysis on the West Coast. In the early 2000s, leadership of both SCIPI and LAPSI began discussing a potential merger. Membership was declining across most psychoanalytic institutes in the United States (for a variety of reasons including changes in insurance coverage for long-term psychotherapy and changing institutional pressures, fewer psychiatrists and psychologists underwent full analytic training), and some of the earlier controversies such as admission of non-physician psychotherapists, had become irrelevant. SCPIS and LAPSI formally merged in 2005, with headquarters at the prior LAPSI building on Sawtelle Boulevard.

In 1813 the department was renamed to Department of the Surveyor of Buildings administered by the Surveyor of Buildings.

Bill's father, Thomas Ah Chow, was born in Hong Kong in 1834, educated in England, worked initially as a sea-cook and then as a ship's steward. He first arrived in NSW in 1855 aged 21 yrs where his spent his first two years. He later came to Victoria to ply the busy coastal route between Melbourne and Port Albert on steamers transporting miners and their equipment to Gippsland‚Äôs goldfields. However, the construction of the Sale Canal between 1883 and 1890, which included the Swing Bridge at Longford, gave closer access to the Port of Sale for boats coming via the Gippsland Lakes. This combined with the opening of the railway from Melbourne to Gippsland in 1877 spelled the ultimate demise of the coastal shipping to Port Albert. Thomas Ah Chow married Agnes Elizabeth Mason on 30 May 1872 and the newlyweds lived in South Melbourne or Emerald Hill as it was known then. The couple eventually settled at Mossiface near Bruthen in about 1880 to become one of the early farming families of the region. Thomas William (Bill) Ah Chow was born at Bruthen on 11 September 1892 as the youngest of 13 children to Thomas and Agnes. Many Chinese came to the Victorian gold rush in the 1850s to seek their fortune at the Omeo and Cassilis diggings. Many of the immigrants later settled and integrated into their local communities working as farm labourers, tending market gardens, making furniture, running grocery stores and cafes or practising Chinese medicine. However, the large and sudden influx of Asian immigrants to the gold fields gave rise to wide-spread fears and prejudice about Chinese immigration to Australia. By the time of Federation in 1901, all Australian colonies had enacted legislation restricting Chinese immigration. These restrictions were part of the White Australia Policy, which sought to ensure that the population remained predominantly British subjects or at least of European origin. The new Federal Parliament passed the Immigration Restriction Act 1901 which allowed the Government to deny entry to people failing an onerous dictation test in any European language chosen by the immigration officer. These policies were progressively dismantled between 1949 and 1973.  Chinese ANZAC  When the First World War was declared in 1914 Australia issued a call to arms. At the time, the population was approximately 4.9 million and around 420,000 Australians enlisted for service, representing nearly 40% of the male population aged between 18 and 44. However, under the White Australian Policy together with the Defence Act of 1909, those ‚Äúnot substantially of European origin or descent‚Äù were excluded from serving in the naval and military forces. Moreover, minimum physical requirements such as height and chest circumference made it difficult for young Chinese men of smaller stature to enlist.Bill Ah Chow sitting in the buggy, in his army uniform, carefully holding his right arm ‚Äì circa: 1920 Bill Ah Chow attempted to enlist at least twice in the army, first at his home town of Bruthen on 6 May 1915, but was rejected because of his obvious Chinese appearance. Undeterred, he reapplied and was accepted two years later on 19 June 1917 at the nearby City of Sale, where he wrote \\"No\\" on his attestation paper to the question \\"Have you ever been declared unfit for service in His Majesty‚Äôs service?\\" It is thought that the recruitment officer must have questioned his answer because it was crossed out and overwritten with a note \\"yes, not of sufficiently European appearance\\". However, by this time, the war in France was dragging on and restrictions were being relaxed and Thomas William Ah Chow was accepted. Bill was assigned to the 25th reinforcements of the 5th Battalion AIF and sailed to France on-board the HMAT A-32 Themistocles on 4 August 1917. While serving on the Western Front in France, Bill was not only gassed but also wounded three times, once seriously of a gunshot wound to the right shoulder on 31 July 1918. Bill was repatriated to No 1 Australian Auxiliary Hospital which was set in the grounds of the stately Harefield Park near London and saw no further active service. He sailed home from England to Australia on-board the HMAT A-38 Ulysses on 18 January 1919. The community welcomed him with a civic reception at Mossiface on 26 March where he was presented with a small gold medallion.Bruthen and Tambo Times (Vic. : 1914 - 1919), Thursday 27 March 1919, p. 3 http://nla.gov.au/nla.news- article135791288 He was later medically discharged from the Army on 19 June 1919. Like many men of his generation, Bill Ah Chow rarely spoke of his wartime experiences. Overall the Chinese-Australian community supported the war effort with around two hundred enlisting. Nineteen received gallantry awards and forty were killed in action. One of the most famous and decorated was sniper, Billy Sing.  Farmer  Before the War, Bill took a job as a farm roustabout and boundary rider on the remote and historic Bindi Station east of Omeo which was established in 1834 and holds one of the earliest property titles issued in Victoria. In April 1912 he reported finding the dead body of Charlie Price at Scrubby Creek to Omeo police while he was out looking for bullocks. David Kelly was later charged with murder. After the War, Bill returned to Bruthen where he drove sheep and worked cattle. He married Myrtle Cox in 1920 and they initially lived in Swan Reach. The couple had two children Raymond William (1921) and Rose Myrtle (1923). In 1923 he applied for, and after some initial rejections was granted, two small allotments of land totalling 111-2-2 acres under the Soldier Settlement Scheme in the Parish of Bumberrah near Mossiface. Bill stayed on his block until 30 March 1926 but his oat and maize crops were not a success. He also experienced significant medical problems, partly because of his war injuries, including shortness of breath and his shoulder injury proved a major impediment for life as a farmer. Bill and his family then moved to Buchan South and later to Ensay in the Upper Tambo Valley where they lived in the old school house on the edge of town. It is also believed that Bill helped to construct the wooden fire tower at Mt Nowa Nowa for the Forests Commission Victoria (FCV) in 1926/27 when he lived at Buchan South.  Fire Towerman  Bill Ah Chow at Nunniong with his work horses in Jan 1940. Photo: Jim McKinty In the late 1930s, with his good local knowledge of the mountain ranges, Bill was offered a new job as a fire lookout over the summer months by the local Forest Commission Victoria (FCV) District Forester, Jim Westcott. Bill was paid a wage as a Fireguard plus allowances for camping and for providing his own riding horse, packhorse with packsaddle and saddle bags. Provisions and fodder for his horses, were purchased in Bruthen and delivered once a fortnight by the local FCV officer assigned to oversee the area. As a Fireguard, Bill‚Äôs primary role was to spot and report on bushfires from Mt Nugong about 30 km east of Swifts Creek. Riding his horse and leading the pack horse loaded with a portable RC-16 radio (callsign VL3BB), heavy spare battery and the provisions for the day, he made the journey up the steep bridle path 3 km from Bentley's Plain to the summit. After unloading his packsaddles, Bill often let both his horses roam free to make their own way home back down to Bentley's Plain. The Forests Commission also established a Weather Observation Station at Bentley's Plain in 1950 and Bill read the thermometers, measured rainfall, estimated cloud cover, wind speed and direction, recorded the observations and transmitted the information by radio to the FCV office at Bruthen which were then sent to the Bureau of Meteorology once a month. 300x300px At the end of the summer fire spotting season, and after the first good rain of autumn, Bill set off alone on his horse along the many bridle paths that cross-crossed the alpine country as far as the NSW border throwing matches along the way to burn forest fuels and reduce the bushfire risk. Bill would often rendezvous at Limestone Creek with another Fireguard, Charlie Pendergast based at Benambra on a similar expedition. When not on fire lookout duty Bill assisted local Forests Commission crews building nearby forest roads after the 1939 bushfires. The work entailed removing trees with explosives and dragging the stumps with his Clydesdale work horses. The horses also pulled a heavy plough to break out the formation, dragged a grader to shape the surface and moved sections of concrete culvert pipe. However there was still plenty of hard work for the men with hand tools as well handling the horses and explosives. The new roads provided access for firefighting and for logging crews. The nearby Washington Winch was imported into Australia in 1920 and operated initially in Western Australia before being purchased by the Forests Commission for 1939 bushfire salvage logging the Central Highlands around Noojee. It was later sold and moved to its present site by local sawmilling company Ezards in 1959 where it operated until 1961‚Äì62. It remains the only high lead-skyline logging system left in Victoria and is listed on the State Heritage Register.  Mt Nugong Fire Tower  left Mt Nugong sits at an elevation of 1482 m, about 3 km from Bentley‚Äôs Plain. The summit has commanding views over the extensive mountain forests as well as the Tambo Valley below and was one of a network of fire lookouts (hilltop clearings) and fire towers (built structures) created across Victoria as consequence of the Stretton Royal Commission into the disastrous 1939 Black Friday bushfires. Prior to a fire tower and Stanley Hut being built, there was no shelter from sun, wind or cold. In 1952 the Forests Commission scrounged a decommissioned control tower from the RAAF at Bairnsdale Airfield, but the tubular-steel scaffold needed to transported and re-assembled by local FCV crews. There were many logistical difficulties erecting the heavy metal tower because there were no roads to the summit. The structure at Mt Nugong did not include the RAAF air traffic controllers cabin and was still open to the elements until a rudimentary shelter was added in about 1954. Bill often boasted about his eagle eyesight but also complained that the Forests Commission would not issue him binoculars. The new firetower was eventually equipped with an alidade to record compass bearings to smoke sightings and lightning strikes as well as a fixed radio set to communicate with Bruthen or Swifts Creek.Bill Ah Chow. Moscow Villa mountain man. The Melbourne Age newspaper. 27 April 1960. Page 13. Bill worked for the Forests Commission as towerman at Mt Nugong for more than two decades until 1957 but sometimes came out of retirement when a replacement towerman couldn‚Äôt be found. This first tower survived two more decades before a storm blew it down in 1974 and it needed to be rebuilt.  Moscow Villa  When Bill became a fire spotter for Forests Commission Victoria he camped at Bentley‚Äôs Plain on the Nunniong Plateau about 30 km east of Swifts Creek. Bentley‚Äôs Plain was named after John Bentley who was sentenced in 1866 along with James Neville before his Honour Sir Redmond Barry to two years with hard labour for stealing cattle.alt=Bill helped to build Commins Hut and cattle yards on Quinn‚Äôs Plain in 1937 for James (Jim) Commins and Charlie Duke who leased the Nunniong Cattle Run. It was used when mustering stock and Bill Ah Chow also stayed there prior to building his own hut. alt= Bill then built himself a substantial log hut he named ‚ÄúMoscow Villa‚Äù which was completed in January 1942, on the day the Battle of Moscow was won. Bill used local wood to build the hut and hand split the palings. Initially it had an iron chimney which was later replaced in 1975 by large one made of local stone. He lived in Moscow Villa during the summer months and in winter returned to his family in Ensay. While there are some variations to the story, which is common with oral history, bush folklore has it that Moscow Villa was visited at some stage between 1942 and 1947 by a party of senior Forests Commission officials which included Herbert Duncan Galbraith, the Divisional Inspector from Bairnsdale who later became Commissioner, whereupon Bill was challenged about his loyalty and the name of his hut. Bill swiftly retorted that he was not a communist and that the name was an acronym for ‚ÄúMy Own Summer Cottage Officially Welcomes Visitors Inside Light Luncheon Available‚Äù. The visit was during the McCarthyist era and the tensions of the Cold War when Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies was attempting to ban the Communist Party of Australia. Bill's quick wit and humour prevailed and his hut retained its quirky name. Bill had a reputation for welcoming walkers, fisherman and foresters into his comfortable hut to sit around the fire, to share a meal, and enjoy an evening of bush yarns. He was also very proud of his Chinese heritage and would, with little encouragement, don traditional dress for his guests. Moscow Villa is currently maintained by the Department of Environment Land Water and Planning (DELWP) with the support of the Victorian High Country Huts Association and is one of the very few traditional mountain huts to have survived bushfires, neglect and vandalism and remains Bill Ah Chows‚Äô legacy as a popular camping site and snow refuge. The floor was replaced and rotten timbers removed in 1999, and once again in 2018. The stone chimney was built in 1975 by local Forests Commission crew (Brian Shelton, George Gallagher, Gary Antonoff & Peter Walker). The inside loft and wooden table were made by the local DELWP carpenter Brendan Purcell and Bill's family provided material and photos for the information boards inside.  Inconsistencies with some of Bill's historical records  left Thomas William (Bill) Ah Chow died on 18 August 1967 at Omeo, aged 74*, and is buried at Ensay cemetery. * However, some interesting but minor discrepancies come to light when studying Bill's headstone at the Ensay Cemetery. The simple Department of Veteran Affairs brass plaque displays a small Christian Cross, Rising Sun Badge of the ADF and cameo photo of Bill (which is the key link) and describes the grave as belonging to \\"William‚Äù Ah Chow rather than \\"Thomas William‚Äù Ah Chow and his age of death is incorrectly stated as 70 rather than 74. These anomalies were double checked against his WW1 Army Service records held in the Australian National Archives, the Australian War Memorial records, the Victorian Register of Births, Deaths and Marriages and those held at the Victorian Public Record Office. They reveal: #The Victorian Register of Births, Deaths and Marriages records \\"William Thomas‚Äù Ah Chow as being born at Bruthen in 1892 with his father as Thomas and his mother Agnes (Mason). #When Bill first tried to enlist in the Army on 6 May 1915 he has clearly handwritten \\"Thomas William\\" at the top of his attestation papers and signed as \\"Thomas William\\" at the bottom. He states his father, Thomas Ah Chow from Mossiface/Bruthen, as his next-of-kin and correctly states his age as 22 years, 8 months (ie. born September 1892). #At his second successful attempt to enlist on 19 June 1917 he has once again written \\"Thomas William\\" at the top but this time signed as \\"William Thomas\\" at the bottom. He also states his age incorrectly as 25 years and 9 months. (ie. born September _1891_ ). #The Australian National Archives have all his military records stored under ‚ÄúThomas William‚Äù AhChow (one word). All the correspondence on his file is signed T W Ah Chow. #The Australian War Memorial has Bill listed as Private No. 7740 \\"Thomas William\\" Ah Chow on the 1917 embarkation roll. #But records show he married Myrtle Cox on 22 December 1920 as ‚ÄúWilliam Thomas‚Äù Ah Chow. #Then his application for land under the Soldier Settlement Scheme in April 1923 was made under the name and signature of ‚ÄúThomas William‚Äù Ah Chow, aged 30 (ie. born September 1892). #Lastly, the Victorian Register of Births, Deaths and Marriages record that ‚ÄúWilliam Thomas‚Äù Ah Chow died at Omeo in 1967, aged 74, and both his place of birth and parents names coincide with those on his birth certificate. There is no suggestion of impropriety and no explanation is advanced. However, these inconsistencies make it difficult for family genealogists. But to everyone who knew him, he was simply Bill.

Thornburgh was a court case decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in which the Peyote Way Church of God challenged an exemption in the Controlled Substances Act that permitted members of the Native American Church to use peyote in religious ceremonies while not giving the same exemption to members of other churches. The court ruled that the exemption was primarily a political rather than a religious one and that all of Peyote Way's claims were without merit.  Background  The psychedelic drug peyote has been traditionally used by Native Americans. There have been various peyote-based belief systems, but one prominent one is that of the Native American Church, founded in 1918. The Peyote Way Church of God was formed in 1977 by Immanuel Trujillo, a former member of the Native American Church who had left the group in 1966 because he objected to the church's requirement of being a Native American to be a member. Peyote was first made illegal in the United States by the Drug Abuse Control Act Amendments of 1965 but a regulation was issued exempting religious use by the NAC. That exemption continued after the Controlled Substances Act passed in 1970 but continued to apply only to that church. Peyote Way sued in 1980, arguing that the exemption applying to the NAC but not them violated various constitutional rights of the church. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled against them, and they appealed.  Opinion  The majority opinion started by considering Peyote Way's claim under the Free Exercise Clause, which it considered precluded because of the Supreme Court's opinion in Employment Division v. Smith as the laws in question were generally applicable. It then looked at the claims of inequality with the Native American Church's peyote exemption. The court found that because the NAC limited membership only to those of Native American ancestry the exemption was for a political group and it was \\"rationally related to the legitimate governmental objective of preserving Native American culture\\". Hence there was no equal protection problem in only giving the exemption to the NAC. The same justification applied to Peyote Way's argument under the Establishment Clause. Finally the court cited Bowers v. Hardwick in refusing to recognize any new privacy right for Peyote Way to practice their religion. The dissent argued that because the exemption was only for the Native American Church it must necessarily be a religious exemption rather than a political one, but would also have denied Peyote Way's claim for relief because the unconstitutionality of the NAC exemption would not give any rights to them.  Legacy  The decision was criticized in the American Indian Law Review for relying on the NAC's official membership requirements instead of investigating if non-Native individuals were indeed using peyote under the church's umbrella. In 1994 Congress amended the American Indian Religious Freedom Act to legalize peyote use by all members of Indian tribes, making it clear that the granted exemption was to a political group rather than a religious one. The Peyote Way Church of God still exists and offers \\"spirit walks\\" to the public in order for them to take peyote. The church no longer faces legal action. Trujillo died in 2010.

The lead author is Peter Menkhorst along with Danny Rogers and Rohan Clarke. Original illustrations are by Jeff Davis, Peter Marsack and Kim Franklin. The guide covers a total of 936 species that comprise 747 breeding residents or regular migrants, 29 introduced species and 160 vagrants. These birds are grouped as marine and costal birds, freshwater birds and terrestrial birds and then taxonomically. Weighing in at almost 1.5 kilograms and with dimensions of 24.6 cm by 17.2 cm and 3.4 cm thick with 576 pages the size and weight of this book makes it more practical as a reference book than a field guide. However, it is structured as a field guide and the authors call it a field guide in the text (see Acknowledgements page 2 and page 3 as examples).  Description  The Guide starts with a two- page visual reference guide giving the page where each bird can be found and is then followed by an alphabetical quick reference guide. Both are useful in assisting in locating the required page for bird identification. In addition there is an extensive index at the back of the book. This is then followed by details on how the guide was constructed, their sources of information and specifically what area and species were covered. This is followed by sections on identifying birds and on birding in Australia. Before the detailed description of species commences there is a guide for birders to the evolution and classification of birds. While this may not be expected in such a work this section ‚Äúit will get birders thinking‚Äù. This section was written by Dr Leo Joseph of the Australian National Wildlife Collection, CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation). The Guide provides detailed maps indicating where a species or sub-species are likely to occur and shading to help identify where the birds are most likely to occur. Several of the reviewers highlighted this feature as a major positive of the guide and the 10,000 Bird review considered the 2 field guides with this feature the best available. In 2019 the revised edition was published. This edition has updated maps, artwork and species accounts.  Reviews  The Foreword to The Australian Bird Guide was written by Paul Sullivan, Chief Executive of Birdlife Australia, Australia's peak ornithological body. This foreword states that the authors and artists of this book are considered leaders in their field and that the details of species and sub-species is a first for Australian birds. It also describes how the maps are derived from data collected by thousands of people over many decades to give some of the best distribution maps seen in Australian Guides. Booktopia sees the Australian Bird Guide as \\"the most comprehensive field guide to Australian birds ever seen\\", and is effusive about its colour plates and comprehensive species accounts. A review of the guide by Chris Watson, Bafta-winning wildlife sound recordist was predominantly positive and includes an interview with Rohan Clark, one of the authors, which helps to understand why this new guide was developed when Australia has a significant number of existing guides. However, it does point out that some of the plates have colour problems and the reviewer is not a fan of including written bird calls. Watson finished the review with ‚ÄúIn all truth, this could be the most pointless review I‚Äôve ever written. Everyone is going to buy this book and everyone is going to love it. Enjoy!‚Äù Watson asked Clark in the interview if a smartphone app was being considered and he replied that it was a decision of CSIRO Publishing. Alan Pearson from the British Bird Guides also reviewed the book and while he did mention the size of the book, overall he was also very enthusiastic about the guide. While the Chris Watson review was critical of the written bird sounds this review thought they had been done very well. Pearson was also critical that the birds full length (size range) was not provided rather it provides wing size, bill length and weight. Donna Lynn Schulman reviewed this Guide for 10,000 Birds and at the same time compared this guide to the most popular existing Australian bird guides. The author thought that the Australian Bird Guide edged out The Field Guide to the Birds of Australia, 9th edition by Graham Pizzey and Frank Knight, edited by Sarah Pizzey (2012). The review thought the index of the Guide was not as good as the Pizzey and Knight guide. The reviewer preferred the Guide because of the ‚Äúcurrency of information, denseness of text, and quality and quantity of illustrations. They also state that because of the difference in emphasis of the different guides there are many reasons to own more than one of the guides. This review looked at the following guides in its review: * The Australian Bird Guide * Field Guide To The Birds Of Australia, 7th edition by Nicholas Day and Ken Simpson *The Slater Field Guide to Australian Birds * Field Guide To Australian Birds, rev. by Michael Morcombe *The Field Guide to the Birds of Australia, 9th edition by Graham Pizzey and Frank Knight  Awards  * Winner 2017 Whitley Award from the Royal Zoological Society of NSW * Winner of the 2018 Australian Book Industry Award, Small Publisher's Adult Book of the year.

Glasswing operates health, education, migration, and community development programs for children throughout Latin America and New York City.  History  In 2007, Celina de Sola, a Salvadoran humanitarian worker and public health specialist, co-founded Glasswing International with her brother Diego and husband Ken Baker. Its mission is to curb the impact of poverty and violence in Latin America through public education, public health, and community development. Glasswing is headquartered in San Salvador and New York City with offices in Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama.  Overview  Glasswing works in low-income communities where there are high rates of violence, dropout, and most youth have been raised by a single parent or relative other than their biological parents. Its partners in the public and private sectors include USAID, Chevron, Walmart Centroam√©rica, and Hanesbrands. A 2016 study by the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile found that students enrolled in Glasswing's community schools showed improved academic performance, positive behavior changes, increased emotional resilience, and felt they had a better school environment.

All plates from 1910 to 1924 consisted of black characters on a white background, with the state abbreviation added in 1912. In 1924, the colour scheme for car plates was reversed, so that they consisted of white characters on a black background. In 1937, a new serial format was adopted for both cars and lorries, consisting of two letters followed by three numbers, with leading zeros as necessary. This ran from AA-000 to ZZ-999, with the letters I and Q omitted to avoid confusion with the numbers 1 and 0 and the letter O. Plates for both vehicle types consisted of white characters on a black background. When the two-letter serials were exhausted in 1951, a three-letter format was introduced, starting at AAA-000. At the same time, the plates' colour scheme changed to black characters on a yolk yellow background. The yolk yellow was replaced with a brighter lemon yellow in 1961, by which point the three-letter serial format had reached the mid 'C' series. In October 1980, around the beginning of the 'L' series, plates with reflective sheeting began to be issued. At the same time, the slogan \\"NSW ‚Äì The Premier State\\" was added at the bottom of the plate; this was used until November 1988. Two further slogans followed, again appearing at the bottom of the plate: \\"NSW ‚Äì The First State\\" from June 1989 to September 1994, and \\"NSW ‚Äì Towards 2000\\" from September 1994 to September 1996. Since September 1996, car plates have carried the full state name at the bottom. In the three-letter serial format, the letters I and Q were omitted originally, but were added in 1970. Several blocks of series were skipped, or were reserved for other vehicle types (see the Skipped Combinations section below). By July 2004, the format had reached the ZLF series, and was thus close to exhaustion. Hence, the current format was introduced, consisting of two letters, two numbers, and two more letters, starting at AA-00-AA. Plates continue to consist of black characters on a lemon yellow background, with reflective sheeting.

In 1951, a separate serial format was introduced for trailers consisting of two letters followed by four numbers. The first letter progressed T, R, A, B and finally C, while the numeric combinations for each series ran from 1000 to 9999; the first serial was thus TA-1000, while the last was CS-9999. Plates continued to consist of white characters on a black background, while the colour scheme for car plates changed (above). In August 1981, trailer plates adopted the same colour scheme as car plates, of black characters on a lemon yellow background. At the same time, a new serial format was introduced consisting of one letter followed by five numbers, starting at A-00000. This format omitted the letters I, O and T, and was exhausted in December 2014. In August 2014, a new trailer plate was introduced consisting of black characters on a white background, and a plain \\"NSW\\" legend. This plate uses the same two-letter, two-number, two- letter serial format as car plates, but has T as the first letter, with the first serial being TR-00-AA. This serial format began to be used on the lemon yellow trailer plate as well from December 2014, beginning with TA-00-AA; at the same time, the legend on this plate was changed from the full state name to \\"NSW ‚Äì TRAILER\\".

In 1937, the colour scheme was reversed to white characters on a black background, and a serial format of two letters followed by two numbers was introduced, running from AA-00 to ZZ-99, with the letters I and Q skipped for the reasons described above. In 1951, the serial format was expanded to two letters followed by three numbers, starting at AA-000. As with car plates, the colour scheme changed at this point to black characters on a yolk yellow background, with the yolk yellow in turn being replaced with lemon yellow in 1961. Since October 1980, motorcycles have been provided with one plate rather than two, and plates have been manufactured with reflective sheeting. The two-letter, three-number serial format was exhausted in August 1989, at which point the current format was introduced, consisting of three letters and two numbers, starting at ZZZ-99 and progressing backwards. In November 2009, a plate consisting of black characters on a white background was introduced, using the same serial format but starting at ABA-00 and progressing forwards.

General notes When a black on yellow plate is judged to be in need of replacement, the Roads and Maritime Services are required to manufacture a replacement at no cost to the owner, hence it is quite common to see plates from older series in the current format. Registration plates, both personalised and standard, are able to be transferred between vehicles. A number of Sydney bus operators still recycle old plates including Forest Coach Lines and Punchbowl Bus Company.New South Wales Fleet Lists Australian Bus Fleet Lists This practice has since ceased as the Road and Maritime Services has insisted all old plates need to be remade into the current base.

Plate customisation has also been added into the coloured, premium range and recently motorcycles (7 March). Certain restrictions about combinations have been put in place to prevent people from designing plates which appear too much like numeral-only plates which are auctioned off separately (e.g. 9I2 would not be allowed as it is too similar to 912). There are also restrictions preventing people from picking combinations that are too similar to special plates issued by the Authority (for instance, HC-nnn and HC-nnnn combinations are reserved only for accredited hire-car operators).  Special purpose vehicles  Vehicles with particular purposes in New South Wales have been introduced with numberplates specific to their type. * Taxis have two types of plate: Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong plates have a T¬∑nnnn format, while regional and country taxis use TC¬∑nnnn. As of October 2009, the Taxi plate design has changed to its current format following enforcement camera errors showing the zeros or eights between the character spaces. It has an embossed premium slimline at the top with sticker for LPG, CNG and TPG moved to two bottom corners. The white on blue reflective base remain the same. NSW -TAXI is the legend description. * Tow truck plates use nnnn¬∑TT or nnnn¬∑TT and as of March 2018 123-TTT was seen on a table top tow truck nnn¬∑TTT depending on the registered use of the vehicle. They have blue characters on a white background, and the top of the plate reads \\"TOW TRUCK\\", that was introduced in October 2000. The original yellow on black format with NSW The First state or Towards 2000 began in November 1990. It is now in the current NEW SOUTH WALES format and is seen to have 9906-TT as of 28 March 2008. As of September 2008 it is in 9800s series, but now it is issued in 7000 to 8999 unused blocks as the first one 7002-TT was seen at the Northern Beaches as of December 2008. * Buses have black on yellow plates, with the prefix Metro: M/O¬∑nnnn, Country: nnnn¬∑MO (Motor Omnibus) or nnnn¬∑ST 2008-current (State Transit Buses) nnnn¬∑ST 2018\\\\. Commercial buses in Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong districts have M/O-nnnn plates, with the M over the O; all other commercial buses use nnnn-MO. Like other vehicles, buses not used for hire or reward are registered with general-issue car plates. The M/O¬∑1000 to M/O¬∑3999 range was reserved for the State Transit Authority and its predecessors.State Transit Authority ‚Äì Sydney/Newcastle Buses Australian Bus Fleet Lists When the end of the series was reached in the early 1970s the series was reissued before again being exhausted again in 2000. Some plates were reissued for a third time before the State Transit Authority adopted its own nnnn¬∑ST series from 2008. In March 2018 the base colour issued to one bus has the yellow NEW SOUTH WALES legend. The M/O¬∑6nnn series was reserved for the Wollongong region, but now cancelled M/O 6000s series are re-issued to private buses in Sydney, which continues from M/O¬∑5nnn series and into 8000s as of June 2019. * Tourist vehicles have black on yellow plates, with the prefix TV¬∑nnna. Originally issued as yellow on black TV¬∑nnn plates in the 1960s, before changed to reflective black on yellow format in the early 1980s. At the time the tourist coach market was heavily regulated with a finite number of TV plates on issue, making them like taxi plates a traded commodity. As of September 2018 it has reached TV-9999 and is reissuing cancelled blocks from TV-1000 onwards. Starting on 2 October 2019, new TV series commenced at TV-001A using last alpha suffix in place of numerical. * Police and emergency vehicles in New South Wales, such as ambulances and police vehicles, are using aaa-nna slimline plates for cars. Some police vehicles have had personalised plates fitted, for example several Highway Patrol vehicles have plates featuring the HWP series from 1975 and in recent decades the initials of officers killed on duty. During the 2010s HWP series were allocated to Police HWP motorcycles and VIP series during the 2000s, that continues to today. NSW Ambulance plates in 1937 had AC series plates allocated for the duration of the original AA-000 to ZZ-999 series. From the 1960s CDA series plates were allocated to Central District Ambulances in Sydney but no longer in use as was phased out in the 1980s.New South Wales Rural Fire Service vehicles were exempted from displaying registration plates, however some have been fitted with standard issue plates. New South Wales Fire Brigades vehicles were at one stage only fitted with brass plates featuring the letters \\"NSWFB\\". These plates were red on gold brass and from 1984, NSWFB plates were pressed into standard dies in gold and red base. It was withdrawn from 1991 when FBY-000 to FBY-999 was allocated that lasted until 2010 when it was replaced by the standard series. * Conditional Registration Scheme nnnnn¬∑E Conditional Motorcycle format: nnnn¬∑N Forklift, Off-Road Vehicles, etc., that need to use public roads as part of their operation can be registered conditionally. As of June 2008, it is reported that the motorcycle sized series has overflowed to 0001-C onwards after reaching 9999-C then moved onto M and N suffix. By June 2019 89000-D suffix Conditional Plates are the latest issues. nnnn¬∑U for machinery/tractors commenced in December 2013 starting as T suffix to balance between existing Conditional and Machinery/Tractors types. As of May 2018, it moved to U suffix series. * Rally vehicle plates: nnnnn¬∑R Introduced in 2014,with the slogan NSW ‚Äì Rally Vehicle. * Historic and veteran cars Cars ‚Äì nnnnn¬∑J Cycles ‚Äì nnnn¬∑J From 1959 to 2002 there were colourful club plates provided by the club and was manufactured in either Vintage Car or Veteran Car legend on top.

Available from January 2017‚Äîusing slimline embossed dies format and 5 character base that was later replaced by motorcycle sized plates following feedback from dealers. :* This clarifies the allocation of trailer and motorcycle plates as B-series motorcycle trade plates have been discontinued and replaced by the allocation of 6000A to 9999A series. Trailers have moved to 0000A to 5999A replacing the three numeric blocks. This previous permanent arrangement existed from 1991 to 2003 in colour as shown: A¬∑nnnn. * CC Consular Plates ‚Äì CC¬∑nnnn Special purpose plates are used for consular corps since 1978 in CC-2000 to CC-4999 range, initially in white on blue then changed to black on yellow by August 1983, with the same legend at top NSW CONSULAR CORPS. The legend moved from top to the bottom from changeover to fat dies in October 1992 and since the variations of dies and bases were updated on a few occasions to the current style.  Other purpose plates  *NSW Auxiliary A supplementary plate to be displayed on a bike rack or other kind of racks displaying the duplicate number/alpha combination was introduced in October 1995, initially in black on off white non reflective and screenprinted legend as \\"NSW ‚Äì BIKE RACK\\" . In 1998 it changed to black on reflective white, again on screenprinted legend. In 1999 the legend changed to embossed. In 2006 the legend reverted to screenprinted.

He was an expert on lions and their biology and was responsible for coining the behavioural term \\"flehmen\\". Biography Schneider was born in Callenberg, Lichtenstein, one of six siblings in a merchant family. He studied in his hometown and then at Waldenberg where he became a teacher from 1908 working in Meerane. In 1912 he received an Abitur from the Realgymnasium Freiberg and a degree in science in 1910 from the University of Leipzig. In 1913 he wrote a thesis on the philosophy of Heinrich Rickert's transcendentalism, but due to the onset of World War I he received a doctorate only in 1918. During the war he was drafted into the front line and was injured in the lower left leg, leading to its amputation. After the war he became an assistant in zoology at Frankfurt University. In 1919 he moved to Leipzig and worked at the university and as an assistant in the Leipzig Zoo from 1920. In 1934 he became director of the Leipzig Zoo where he took a special interest in the breeding behaviour of big cats, particularly lions. He coined the word flehmen in 1930 for the characteristic displays of big cats and several other mammals. The zoo was very successful in captive breeding and even exported lions to Africa. He wrote extensively and was popular due to TV shows that he directed and presented.Prof. Dr. Karl Max Schneider (1887-1955) (in German).

Prior to the mid 1970s, the role was essentially filled under the title Vice presidents of Programs. {  !Name !Years !Notes - James T. Aubrey March 1957 ‚Äì April 28, 1958 As vice president in charge of programs (a title he gained before March 1957), he brought to the air what he recalled as \\"wild, sexy, lively stuff, things that had never been done before,\\" shows such as Maverick, a western with James Garner, and 77 Sunset Strip, a detective show with Efrem Zimbalist Jr. (However, by the time Strip went on the air in October 1958, Aubrey had already left the network.) Oulahan and Lambert said Aubrey scheduled \\"one lucrative show after another ... and for the first time the third network became a serious challenge to NBC and CBS.\\" Among the successes he scheduled were The Donna Reed Show, a domestic comedy; The Rifleman, a western with Chuck Connors; and The Real McCoys, a rural comedy with Walter Brennan and Richard Crenna. - Thomas W. Moore 1958‚Äì1963 Among the shows aired during this time were The Real McCoys, 77 Sunset Strip, My Three Sons, The Flintstones, Ben Casey, and The Untouchables. While he was network president, the network added, among other shows, McHale's Navy, Peyton Place, The Addams Family and Batman. - Edgar Scherick June 1963‚Äì1966 In June 1963, Scherick became Vice President of Programming for the ABC Television Network, where he created many popular shows including Bewitched, Batman, That Girl, The Hollywood Palace, and Peyton Place. - Leonard Goldberg 1966‚Äì1969  - Martin Starger 1969‚Äì1972; 1972‚Äì1975 He led ABC during its boom period in the 1970s, pioneering the creation of television shows such as ABC Movie of the Week, Marcus Welby, M.D. and Happy Days. He also pushed the limits of television broadcast presiding over pioneering miniseries and specials such as Roots and Rich Man, Poor Man. - Barry Diller 1973‚Äì1974 He was hired as an assistant by Elton Rule, then west coast head of ABC, who was promoted to network President at the same time Diller went to work for him in 1964, taking him on to New York City. Diller was soon placed in charge of negotiating broadcast rights to feature films. He was promoted to Vice President of Development in 1965. In this position, Diller created the ABC Movie of the Week, pioneering the concept of the made-for-television movie through a regular series of 90-minute films produced exclusively for television. - Fred Silverman 1975‚Äì1978 Silverman was named president of ABC Entertainment in 1975,Smith-Shomade, Beretta E. (January 10, 2013) \\"Watching While Black\\". Rutgers University Press, p. 21, 280 pages. Retrieved August 20, 2014. putting him in the awkward position of saving Happy Days, the very show that Good Times had brought to the brink of cancellation. Silverman succeeded in bringing Happy Days to the top of the ratings and generating a hit spin-off from that show, Laverne & Shirley. At ABC, Silverman also greenlit other popular series such as The Bionic Woman (a Six Million Dollar Man spin-off), Family, Charlie's Angels, Donny & Marie, Three's Company, Eight Is Enough, The Love Boat, Soap, Fantasy Island, Good Morning America, long form pioneer Rich Man, Poor Man and the award-winning miniseries, Roots. These moves brought ABC's long-dormant ratings from third place to first place. However, Silverman was criticized during this period for relying heavily on escapist fare (it was Silverman who conceived the infamous The Brady Bunch Hour with Sid and Marty Krofft in late 1976) and for bringing T&A; or \\"jiggle TV\\" to the small screen with numerous ABC shows featuring buxom, attractive, and often scantily-clad young women (such as the popular Battle of the Network Stars). ABC Daytime had mediocre ratings, so in order to increase them, Silverman hired Gloria Monty to produce the ailing General Hospital. He gave Monty thirteen weeks to increase the serial's ratings or it would be cancelled. He later expanded General Hospital and One Life to Live to a full hour, and created a 3 hour afternoon serial block. Among game shows, Silverman introduced Goodson- Todman's Family Feud to the network. During Silverman's time at ABC, he overhauled the network's Saturday-morning cartoon output, dumping Filmation (which had produced the failed Uncle Croc's Block) and replacing it with content from Hanna-Barbera, including a continuation of Scooby-Doo. ABC abandoned the wiping of video-taped programs under Silverman's watch in 1978, as CBS had done while he was at that network. - Anthony Thomopoulos 1978‚Äì1983 His big break came in 1973, when Barry Diller hired him on at ABC to oversee prime-time programming. He was noted, among other things, for the tough position he took in dealing with the contract holdout of Suzanne Somers on the hit ABC show Three's Company,Tom Shales, \\"Behind 'Three's Company,' Somers and Smoke\\", The Washington Post, May 12, 2003 . and for his quick cancellation of the 1982 cult favorite Police Squad!, explaining that the show had been cancelled because, among other reasons, \\"it required constant attention\\".Barbara Holsapple, \\"Do Viewers Need Help With 'Police Squad?', Pittsburgh Press, July 1, 1982.Steve Weinstein, \\"Never Ready for Prime Time? : 'Doctor, Doctor' is the latest wild and crazy comedy to find the going tough on network TV\\", Los Angeles Times, March 4, 1990.\\" - Lewis Erlicht 1983 ‚Äì November 1985 After seeing Emmanuel Lewis in a Burger King commercial, ABC's programming chief, Lew Erlicht, wanted to give the actor his own series. At this time, Another Ballgame creator Stu Silver desired to develop an original show based on the lead characters portrayed by Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy in the film Woman of the Year and saw Alex Karras and Susan Clark's on- screen chemistry as being strikingly reminiscent of this. The network felt the need to cast Lewis in a project quickly, before he grew another inch (like child actor Gary Coleman, who was also small for his age, Lewis would end up at 4'3\\".) With the number of comedy pilots ABC had greenlit for that fall's schedule, it was likely that Lewis would not be able to get his own series and timeslot unless he was worked into already-existing comedy projects. So, among others shows, co-producers on Another Ballgame were approached about working Lewis into the show. Stars Karras and Clark liked the idea of the sudden marriage and instant adoption of a young black boy, and the Webster character was thus created. Moonlighting was created by Glenn Gordon Caron, one of the producers of the similar Remington Steele, when he was approached by Erlicht. Erlicht liked the work Caron had done on Taxi and Remington Steele and wanted a detective show featuring a major star in a leading role who would appeal to an upscale audience. Caron wanted to do a romance, to which Erlicht replied \\"I don't care what it is, as long as it's a detective show.‚Äù - Brandon Stoddard 1985‚Äì1989 During his tenure as the head of ABC entertainment shows such as Roseanne, The Wonder Years and Thirtysomething were created. - Bob Iger 1989‚Äì1992  - Ted Harbert 1992‚Äì1996 At ABC, Harbert was closely associated with groundbreaking programs such as The Wonder Years,NYPD Blue,The Practice, and My So Called Life, among many others, and, during his tenure, ABC moved to the top in primetime programs in 1995 for the first time in 17 years, and led all the networks in profits for several years. - Jamie Tarses 1996‚Äì1999 Tarses was the first woman and one of the youngest people to hold such a post in an American broadcast network.

His decision was vindicated, however, when the show went on to become a huge success. Braun and his partner, Susan Lyne, also greenlit other ABC shows that went on to great success in the years following his dismissal, including Desperate Housewives, Extreme Makeover Home Edition, Boston Legal and Grey's Anatomy. These shows began an unprecedented turnaround for ABC. - Stephen McPherson 2004 ‚Äì July 2010 With relatively little buzz surrounding its 2010‚Äì11 pilots, compounded by a sexual harassment lawsuit against him, Stephen McPherson resigned as ABC Entertainment Group president on July 27, 2010.

It is also commonly called data extrusion or data exportation. Data exfiltration is also considered a form of data theft. Since the year 2000, a number of data exfiltration efforts severely damaged the consumer confidence, corporate valuation, and intellectual property of businesses and national security of governments across the world.  Types of exfiltrated data  In some data exfiltration scenarios, a large amount of aggregated data may be exfiltrated. However, in these and other scenarios, it is likely that certain types of data may be targeted. Types of data that are targeted includes: * Usernames, associated passwords, and other system authentication related information * Information associated with strategic decisions * Cryptographic keys * Personal financial information * Social security numbers and other personally identifiable information (PII) * Mailing addresses * United States National Security Agency hacking tools  Techniques  Several techniques have been used by malicious actors to carry out data exfiltration. The technique chosen depends on a number of factors. If the attacker has or can easily gain physical or privileged remote access to the server containing the data they wish to exfiltrate, their chances of success are much better than otherwise. For example, it would be relatively easy for a system administrator to plant, and in turn, execute malware that transmits data to an external command and control server without getting caught. Similarly, if one can gain physical administrative access, they can potentially steal the server holding the target data, or more realistically, transfer data from the server to a DVD or USB flash drive. In many cases, malicious actors cannot gain physical access to the physical systems holding target data. In these situations, they may compromise user accounts on remote access applications using manufacturer default or weak passwords. In 2009, after analyzing 200 data exfiltration attacks that took place in 24 countries, SpiderLabs discovered a ninety percent success rate in compromising user accounts on remote access applications without requiring brute-force attacks. Once a malicious actor gains this level of access, they may transfer target data elsewhere. Additionally, there are more sophisticated forms of data exfiltration. Various techniques can be used to conceal detection by network defenses. For example, Cross Site Scripting (XSS) can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to provide a malicious actor with sensitive data. A timing channel can also be used to send data a few packets at a time at specified intervals in a way that is even more difficult for network defenses to detect and prevent. File:Data Exfiltration Methods.jpgalt=Main data exfiltration techniquesMain data exfiltration techniques  Preventive measures  A number of things can be done to help defend a network against data exfiltration. Three main categories of preventive measures may be the most effective: * Preventive * Detective * Investigative One example of detective measures is to implement intrusion detection and prevention systems and regularly monitor network services to ensure that only known acceptable services are running at any given time. If suspicious network services are running, investigate and take the appropriate measures immediately. Preventive measures include the implementation and maintenance of access controls, deception techniques, and encryption of data in process, in transit, and at rest. Investigative measures include various forensics actions and counter intelligence operations.

He is thought to be the most prolific artist working in dalle de verre in the UK in the 20th century. His contributions to listed Modernist buildings are an integral part of their value and are mentioned in their listings. Life and work The ceiling of the Lantern Tower, painted by Dom Charles Norris, 1939 Dom Charles Norris (1909-2004) was a Benedictine monk and glass artistBuckfast Abbey: History, Art and Architecture (editor P Beacham), 'Modern Medievalism: Dom Charles Norris, Dalle de Verre and the Blessed Sacrament Chapel' by R Proctor, (2017) He was born Louis Charles Norris and he studied at the Royal College of Art in the 1920s. He entered Buckfast Abbey in 1930 as the age of 21 and began to work as a stained glass artist in 1933. He supervised a team of monks to rebuild the abbey, including the east window in dalle de verre in the Blessed Sacrament Chapel. Pierre Fourmaintraux is said to have brought the dalle de verre technique to Britain before joining James Powell and Sons (later Whitefriars Glass Studio) in 1956. He trained Dom Charles Norris in the technique, with Norris becoming one of the most prolific British proponents. Norris's design of the east window is mentioned in the List Entry Summary for Buckfast Abbey on the Historic England site. In addition to his work in the workshops of Buckfast Abbey, Dom Charles Norris also had an association with the workshop at Prinknash Abbey and with Aylesford Priory in Kent. Dom Charles Norris completed windows for a large number of churches including those at Perranporth Our Lady's, Lillington and Our Lady of Fatima, Harlow. Stained glass window at Buckfast Abbey, 1965 A review by the Diocese of Plymouth and English Heritage notes: \\"The latter Waldo Maitland‚Äôs Our Lady of the Portal and St Piran, Truro (1973) is one of a large number of churches in the Diocese with stained glass designed and made under the supervision of Dom Charles Norris at Buckfast Abbey (an early example at Falmouth, dating from 1948, is illustrated on the front cover).\\"Churches in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Plymouth: An Architectural and Historical Review for English Heritage and the Diocese of Plymouth, The Architectural History Practice Limited, 2009 Works Buckfast Abbey Buckfast Abbey credits Dom Charles with the following artworks, noting: \\"In 1968 Dom Charles completed his most striking embellishment of the church the huge east window in the Blessed Sacrament Chapel. This employs the technique known as dalles-de-verre in which ‚Äòtiles‚Äô of coloured glass are chipped into shape and laid, mosaic- fashion, in a matrix of resin. Following this work, windows were made at Buckfast for many churches throughout the country.\\" *Painted the lantern tower ceiling in egg-tempera (1939). *Designed the marble pavement in the choir (1949). *Laid the floor in the Lady Chapel (1958). *Stained glass window at Buckfast Abbey (1965). *East window in the Blessed Sacrament Chapel (1968). A review by the Diocese of Plymouth and English Heritage notes: \\"Norris‚Äôs finest work is at Buckfast itself, where his glass of 1965 floods the newly-built Lady Chapel with warm red and blue glows\\". Work on listed buildings Church of Our Lady Lillington, Grade II listed, showing dalle de verre walls on left hand side of building Many of the listings of notable 20th century churches include references to the importance of Dom Charles Norris's work. He collaborated on several listed churches with notable 20th century architect Gerard Goalen and artist Steven Sykes. St Gregory the Great, South Ruislip - Grade II listed Designed by Gerard Goalen in 1965, Historic England gives as a reason for its designation 'artistic interest', saying: \\"reflective of a culture of sacred art within the Catholic Church, and Goalen‚Äôs interest in the use of contemporary art in combination with architecture, St Gregory‚Äôs contains several notable works of art by a number of highly regarded C20 artists, including Patrick Reyntiens, Steven Sykes, Dom Charles Norris and Willi Soukup\\". Church of Our Lady Lillington - Grade II listed A Roman Catholic church, built in 1963, by Henry Fedeski ARIBA, with extensive dalle- de-verre glass by Dom Charles Norris OSB of Buckfast Abbey, and mosaic by Steven Sykes. Historic England cites the Church's artistic embellishment as one of the reasons for its designation. \\"The glory of the church is the extensive scheme of brightly-coloured dalle-de-verre glass designed by Dom Charles Norris of Buckfast Abbey, which fills the walls entirely at clerestory level, and is used for all the ground-floor glazing; it is complemented by mosaic work by Steven Sykes, who had also worked at Coventry Cathedral.\\" Although designed by Norris, the glass itself was made at Prinknash Abbey. Church of Our Lady Fatima, Harlow - Grade II listed A Roman Catholic church designed 1953-4 by Gerard Goalen and built 1958‚Äì60. Its listing by Historic England says: \\"The chief decorative feature is the slab and fused slab glass set in concrete, designed and made by Dom Charles Norris OSB of Buckfast Abbey, assisted by Paulinus Angold and Jerome Gladman...[the church] was the first to combine this [liturgically-planned features] with modern glass, already so popular in France, Germany and Switzerland, where Goalen had travelled extensively.\\" Marychurch, Hatfield - Grade II listed A Roman Catholic church designed in 1970 by George Mathers. Historic England cites the glasswork as one of the reasons for the church's listing: \\"The church is embellished by highly accomplished pieces of art work: these include the extensive scheme of dalle de verre glass by Dom Charles Norris and Dom Paulinus Angold, as well as the welded steel screen and font by Angela Godfrey\\". The listing goes on to elaborate on Norris's contribution: \\"The windows in Marychurch were designed by Dom Charles Norris (d.2004), a Benedictine monk and artist, trained at the Royal College of Art, who with Dom Paulinas Angold (d.2010) had been responsible for the creation and construction of the coloured glass at Buckfast Abbey Church (Grade II*), where they developed the technique to create lighter windows using Epoxy Resin and sand instead of concrete.\\" The Parish Church of St John The Evangelist, Exmouth - Grade II listed This church was reordered in 1964 and at that time a dalle-de-verre screen by Dom Charles Norris was added. Historic England highlights the screen in its listing noting how Dom Charles Norris's work in this material \\"became well-known and influential\\". Church of the Holy Redeemer, St Wulstan and St Eadburga, Pershore - Grade II listed A Roman Catholic church designed by Scottish architect Hugh Bankart ARIBA, FRIBA in 1958‚Äì59, which includes a three-light dalle-de-verre west window by Dom Charles Norris. Shrine of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and St Simon Stock, Aylesford - Grade II* listed The Roman Catholic Shrine was designed by Adrian Gilbert Scott. It contains works by a large number of notable artists including (in the Relic Chapel) \\"four pairs of semi-abstract dalle de verre windows made by Dom Charles Norris from Kossowski‚Äôs designs\\". Norris also contributed the windows in the exedra chapels. Church of St Bernadette, Belfast - Grade B+ listed A fan-shaped Roman Catholic church capable of seating over 1000 people which was designed by Brian Gregory and opened in 1967. It contains many works of modern art, most notably a nine-foot-high Crucifixion sculpture by Elisabeth Frink. Dom Charles Norris' dalle-de-verre windows form the whole of the curved fa√ßade of the building.

She married the Reverend William Belcher in 1870, and had five children with him, although one died young. In 1886, Dickenson left England and travelled to Tasmania, Australia. There she met and married Augustus Maximillian Dickenson, a medical doctor based in Deloraine, Tasmania. In 1888 the couple had a daughter, Augusta Edith Dickenson, known as Austral. In the 1890s Dickenson travelled through Australia, India and South Africa; she wrote articles and took photographs for The Adelaide Advertiser newspaper. She published a small volume entitled \\"What I Saw In India and the East\\" in 1900. In 1899 The Adelaide Advertiser and The Adelaide Chronicle supported Dickenson to travel to South Africa, where the Boer War had broken out, and write articles about the war. She met and interviewed Australian nurses, and described conditions in refugee camps, orphanages, hospitals and prisoner of war camps. She was frequently critical of the conditions people and children were kept in.

He was educated at the lyc√©e in Ben Aknoun and showed a precocious talent as a composer. His first published song, \\"Reine de pr√©s\\" was written when he was 14 and had considerable success. His teacher suggested that he go to France to study at the Conservatoire de Paris, but his mother was opposed to the idea. Instead, at the age of 16 he enrolled in the in Algiers where he won the first prize in harmony the following year. While still a student at the √âcole sup√©rieure several of his songs were performed at the Casino d'Alger. Valsien eventually went to Paris after completing his military service as a nurse stationed at B√¥ne in the north- eastern corner of Algeria. In Paris he showed his songs to the singer F√©lix Mayol. It marked the beginning of a partnership which produced some of Mayol's greatest successes including \\"Cousine\\", \\"Arrouah Sidi\\", \\"Si l'on s'aime\\", \\"Voil√† pourquoi\\", and \\"Bou-dou-ba-da-bouh!\\". The latter became a prototype for a genre of popular songs depicting soldiers from France's African colonies and inspired the title of Bon Candidat Boudoubadabout, one of Georges Rouault's etchings in the series Les R√©incarnation du P√®re Ubu. At the outbreak of World War I, Valsien rejoined the army as a nurse and was stationed at Barlin in northern France. While under bombardment by German artillery, he composed the song \\"Petit matelot\\" which Mayol sang in his visits to French military hospitals. Towards the end of the war, he fell ill and was transferred to the auxiliary service in Orl√©ans. There he met Jean Guitton who showed him an operetta libretto he had written, Clo-Clo, and convinced Valsien to set it to music. Clo-Clo (co-composed with Francis Kams) premiered at the Eldorado in 1920 conducted by Valsien himself. In the later years of his career, Valsien devoted himself primarily to conducting for various Paris theatres including the Th√©√¢tre Daunou, Th√©√¢tre des Folies-Wagram, and Th√©√¢tre des Nouveaut√©s as well as conducting dozens of recordings for Odeon Records. He also appeared as an actor in the role of the orchestra conductor in Henri Jeanson's 1949 film Lady Paname. Valsien died in Paris at the age of 73.

It is also known as the Corowa Flour Mill and site. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  First explored by Charles Sturt in 1838, the Corowa-Wahgunyah area was rapidly taken up as squatting runs. The most influential settler was John Foord, son of a well-known Parramatta coach-builder, who was attracted by the district when he was overlanding cattle from the Monaro to Victoria in 1839 and immediately returned to take up , straddling the Murray River. Agriculture, with wheat and tobacco, developed and the gold rushes of the 1850s (including one at Corowa) created a new, significant market. Foord was encouraged in 1856 to lay out a private town on the Victorian side of the river, called Wahgunyah, and in 1857 he bought Henry Hopwood's Echuca punt when Hopwood built his pontoon bridge there. The punt was installed at Wahgunyah but was replaced in 1863 by a privately owned wooden toll-bridge operated by a company headed by John Foord. The bridge was decisive in encouraging urban development on the New South Wales side, where North Wahgunyah, Foord's second private town, became Corowa. The customs houses at the Corowa bridge handled large amounts of wool and the wheat and oats crops were very substantial in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Corowa has been an important centre for grain growing since the 1870s. In 1887 a Roller Flour Milling company was formed in Corowa. This mill, subsequently known as the Netherby Roller Flour Mills, was burnt down in 1920. It was replaced by the current structures. The new four storey brick mill building housed fourteen stands of double steel roller mills, with six silo bins providing storage capacity of in the adjoining skillion roof section. Other new buildings were a brick office and boiler house. The architect of the mill is unknown. However, it is remarkably similar in detail to the mill building in Albury and was probably executed by the same designer and builder. The old boiler house was replaced after the fire with a similar brick building said to have housed a gas engine instead of steam boilers and pumps. Although the motive power had changed, it is evident that the mechanical power transfer system of line-shafting with flat belt drives continued to be in use up until the mill closed in 1970. The milling company exported flour to the U.K. Malaya, Borneo, Indonesia, the Middle East and North Africa through Aden. It also supplied a large domestic market. In the 1950s the mill was processing three tons of flour per hour and a block of concrete silos were built to provide grain storage for this large output. In the years after the closure of the mill in 1970 the milling machinery was removed. In the late 1980s the site was purchased by Bunges, a South American- based company of millers who operate the flour mill in Albury with the intention of extending their stock and grain milling operations to the Corowa Mill building. In 2001, the Corowa Council bought the mill from Goodman Fielder in relation to a planned water works project. Several proposals were made as to what to do with the site over a number of years, but it remained vacant. In 2010, a whisky and chocolate factory, Corowa Whisky and Chocolate, commenced out of the former flour mill.  Description  The complex of mill buildings of heritage significance occupies the southern corner of a very large site. Steel Street runs along the south-west boundary and the railway along the south-east boundary of the site. There is an area of vacant land across the front of Steel Street, along the railway side and to the rear. there is a space of at least ten metres between the mill and the concrete silos to the north-west. All the other buildings on the site are to the north and east. The mill is constructed in the local apricot coloured brick. The modern additions for grain storage are well away from the old buildings and two relatively modern extensions are in a reasonably sympathetic style. One is a gable roofed, galvanised iron clad building attached to the side of the skillion, probably used as a workshop or bagging floor. The other is a hip roofed extension to the small gable roofed brick office building next to the skillion. The small office building is on the west corner of the complex.

They are found throughout the Philippine islands but are most prevalent in large lakes like Laguna de Bay, and sheltered coastal areas like the Manila Bay, Ragay Gulf, and Batan Bay. Variations of salamb√°w lift nets include the bintol (used for catching crabs), panak (used for catching chambered nautilus), tangkal (a stationary lift net operated at night), and the basnig (a deep-water lift net operated from outrigger canoes). Salamb√°w rafts were also known as saraboa or salakab. Etymology Salamb√°w is derived from Proto-Western Malayo- Polynesian *salambaw, meaning a \\"large fishing net\\". Its cognates include s…ôlambaw in Iban and Malay. The term is only used in the northern and Visayan regions in the Philippines and is absent in the south. Description French traveler Paul de la Gironiere 1873 illustration of a salamb√°w raft by German explorer Fedor Jagor Salamb√°w rafts were made from reeds or bamboo lashed together. At the center of the raft is a tall upright pole or a tower structure (timba) around in height. At the top of the pole are two large curving spars crossed with each other. A large square net is attached to the ends of these spars. The pole acts as a crane, it can be tilted to submerge the net using a weighted lever mechanism. The operator either pushes or pulls the lever, or climbs on it to bring it down with their body weight, thus raising the pole. Salamb√°w rafts are usually operated by two people. Though it catches only a few fish at a time, they can be raised and lowered repeatedly every few minutes. Salamb√°w operated at night may use fishing light attractors. These were traditionally candles made of resin. Variants Basnig A basnigan near Basilan with nets deployed Basnig or Balasnig are lift nets operated by a large outrigger boat called Basnigan. They utilize a large bag net suspended directly below or beside the ship. This net is attached to multiple temporary booms projecting from the ship's outriggers and detachable auxiliary masts. Modern basnig typically use generators and electric lights to attract fish and squid. This method is unique to the Philippines. It is common in the Visayas, particularly in the provinces of Capiz and Iloilo. With the poles deployed, the entire ship can look like a spiderweb. Bintol A smaller hand-operated version of the salamb√°w is known as a bintol. It is shaped like a square and is baited. It is used primarily to catch crabs in shallow water. Bintol are usually lowered to the bottom of inland waters, at depths of . Panak Another specialized deep- sea lift net is known as the panak. It is used to catch lagang (chambered nautilus, which are valued for their shells), and sometimes lobsters. Panak can be lowered to extreme depths of . In contrast to the shallow-water salamb√°w, they are only lowered and raised around ten times a night. Tangkal Tangkal or bintahan are large stationary lift nets. They use box-shaped nets and are operated from a bamboo platform built on the shoreline or out at sea. They typically use kerosene lamps placed above the center of the net as fish attractors. The nets are lifted by means of counterweights, with the fish collected by long hand nets. They are typically used to catch anchovies, mullets, slipmouths, and barracudas. It is similar to an Indonesian lift net known as bagan. Cultural significance One of the three patron saints of the Catholic Obando Fertility Rites in Obando, Bulacan is Nuestra Se√±ora Inmaculada Concepci√≥n de Salamb√°o, better known as Our Lady of Salamb√°o. She is named thus because her figurine was supposedly discovered by fishermen in a salamb√°w net.

It was designed by James Barnet, the Colonial Architect, and built from 1886 to 1887 by W. Squires. It is also known as the Corowa Court House. The property is owned by the Department of Justice, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000.  History  First explored by Charles Sturt in 1838, the Corowa-Wahgunyah area was rapidly taken up as squatting runs.

Construction commenced in May 1886 and was completed in 1887. This Court House was chosen in 1893 for the promotion of an Australian Federation League, where discussions were held by various states in the lead up to the Federation of Australia.  Description  The courthouse is a red brick building, with darker red brick flat arches over windows; roofs are hipped, corrugated iron. A verandah to front of courthouse has paired timber posts which are fairly plain. The building is symmetrical, but has a flat roof extension to one side. Doors to smaller wings on either side have etched glass panels. The Corowa Court House was designed during the transitional period between the Victorian and Federation era. The building is a Palladian composition with a central two storey block flanked on either side by single storey wings. Building detail uses Georgian Revival elements with double hung sash windows and flat brick arched lintels over. The central block features a ground floor verandah across the front facade which is supported on pairs of stop chamfered timber columns decorated with cast iron brackets.  Condition  As at 26 October 2000, the building condition was good; with a weatherboard addition at rear. The timber furniture and fittings were still intact, and in good condition.  Heritage listing  As at 25 May 2010, the building was a plain, brick courthouse which is symmetrical, and has pleasing proportions. It makes an important contribution to the character of the streetscape. One of the conferences to urge for the federation of colonies was held in the courthouse 31 July and 1 August 1893. A fine example of late 19th century transitional architecture which has a Georgian Revival appearance. This Court House is of historical and social significance and was used as the venue for discussions held between the various states prior to the Federation of Australia. The courthouse was a venue for the 1893 'People's Conference' organised by the Australian Federation League and the 1902 Premiers' meeting leading up to the River Murray Agreement.* The Corowa Courthouse was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. History In 1836, Jacob Fishbeck Sr. moved from St. Lawrence County, New York to Michigan, following his son Freeman, who had moved the previous year. They were soon joined by the remainder of Jacob Sr.'s children: Jacob Jr., Nicholas, Philip, Levi, and Elsey, and Isabella. The family constructed a house on this property and began farming; however, Jacob Sr. died in 1839, leaving the farm to his son Jacob Jr. The younger Jacob Fishbeck and his wife Aeroea continued to farm the land, eventually having three children. Aeroea Fishbeck died in the early 1850s, and in 1853 Jacob Fishbeck married Sarah A. Rodgers; the couple eventually had two children in addition to Jacob's three. Also in 1853, Jacob constructed the current house on the property. Although the builder of the house is not certain, it was likely constructed by family friend and local carpenter David Pierce. Jacob Fishbeck Jr. farmed the property until 1868 when he sold it to William R. Geer. In 1870 it was sold again to Peter T. Gill, who lived on the property until 1883, when he sold the farm to John Milet and his sons John Milet Jr. and Thomas Milet. In 1887 John Milet Jr. bought out his father and brother. John Milet Jr. married Catherine Stafford, and the couple eventually had five children: Mary E., John H., Frank, Anna, and Walter. John Milet Jr. died in 1912, after which his estate was divided among his wife and children, all of whom were living at home at the time. His eldest son John H. Milet assumed operation of the farm along with his mother, and continued operating it through her death in 1942 and his in 1958. After this Anna ran the farm until her death in 1975, after which three of her nieces inherited the property. They subdivided the property, but left the farmstead intact. The farmstead was sold to first to Eugene Montague, and then in 1995 to Alan and Amelia Gliese. Description The Jacob Fishbeck farmstead complex includes an 1853 farmhouse, a small barn, privy, garage, and chicken coop. The house is a Greek Revival example of the Upright and Wing house, consisting of a 1-1/2 story upright with a one-story side wing and a rear addition. The house is clad with weatherboard, and sits on a stone foundation. It has a wide roof cornice and several porches, including a porch fronting the wing which is supported by square Tuscan columns. The windows in the house are double hung, predominately six-over-six units. The main door is located at the center of the upright, and has an elaborate surround with pilasters to the side and a pediment above. A second door in the wing section provides access through the porch, and two more doors are located on the sides. The barn is a small gambrel roof structure, likely constructed about 1885. A shed roof addition runs along one side. The foundation is a mixture of stone and concrete, and the barn is clad with a variety of materials, including board and batten siding and flush vertical boarding. The remaining structures, including the privy, garage and chicken coop, are located in a cluster; these buildings likely date from the early 20th century. The privy is a small rectilinear building with a shed roof clad with clapboard siding with a hinged door. The garage is a rectilinear structure with a gable roof and a shed roof addition. The chicken coop is a simple shed roof structure with two doors and a row of windows.

However, following a string of legal disputes over what El Greco deemed inadequate pay for his work, along with his decision to prioritize showcasing his own stylistic choices over a straightforward and naturalistic depiction of religious content, the Cretan master achieved just the opposite. Consequently, El Greco remained in Toledo for the rest of his life, where he was well-received by his contemporaries such as the Spanish preacher and poet Hortensio F√©lix Paravicino, who remarked that, \\"Crete gave him life and the painter's craft, Toledo a better homeland, where through death he began to achieve eternal life.\\" Other than the appreciation shown towards El Greco by his contemporaries, he also found success in his artistic career.

Analysis The work's overarching theme is one that had been extensively developed by El Greco over a couple decades of his career. It essentially served as a predecessor to his later Immaculate Conception. In the earlier work, El Greco defies the conventional Western pictorial composition; instead of causing the viewer's glance to travel from right to left, as was the usual line of sight, Saint John is positioned in the bottom left corner of the painting, struck by the vision of the Madonna floating above him.Stoichita, Victor I. \\"Image and Apparition: Spanish Painting of the Golden Age and New World Popular Devotion.\\" RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics, no. 26 (1994): 32-46. http://www.jstor.org/stable/20166903. In this way, El Greco's unorthodox composition becomes a consciously chosen visual device: the viewer becomes incorporated into the painting by being placed in the shoes of Saint John. Notably, even in this early ideological stage for the theology in relation to the Virgin Mary, Saint John, with his back to the viewer, surrenders the spotlight to the mother of Christ. Yet, with a minor role in the painting, the saint's inclusion contributes to a metaphorical representation of the immaculate conception theology; his vision at Patmos during which the Virgin Mary is conceived, by the grace of God, without the sin of humanity. The painting's angular and schematic quality reflects El Greco's constant ties to his Byzantine roots. A mandorla conveys the quality of a halo as it frames Mary's head, and the beaming rays of sunlight are a common motif seen in the artist's works. El Greco implements symbolism with the depiction of roses, iris, olive, and palm, as well as the throne implied by the cherub heads that framed Mary's feet (also seen in The Holy Trinity, 1577‚Äì1579). In the same detail of The Virgin, one can make out a crescent moon which contributes to Mary's unspoiled birth, additionally acting as a cultural insight into Catholic Spain's faith. During the Spanish Renaissance, the Virgin Mary had a widespread cult which attributed the crescent moon to the divine figure.DAVIES, DAVID. \\"El Greco and the Spiritual Reform Movements in Spain.\\" Studies in the History of Art 13 (1984): 57-75. http://www.jstor.org/stable/42617963. The thornless roses allude to a part of nature which is often used to reflect the relations between God and Christ, one that has no imperfections. The enclosed garden alludes to hortus conclusus; its inclusion implies the Virgin's virtue and purity. 180x180px 200x200px References Category:1580s paintings Category:Paintings by El Greco El Greco Category:Angels in art Category:Birds in art Category:Mannerism ","title":"The Immaculate Conception with St John the Evangelist"},{"id":"57811677","text":"The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception is a painting of the Immaculate Conception by El Greco.

Painted for the high altar of the Chapel of Oballe, San Vicente, Toledo, it was the schematic centerpiece and was accompanied by the Visitation. Two other probable companions are the renditions of Saint Peter and Saint Ildefonso. As in the earlier version, El Greco includes several elements attributed to the Virgin Mary: such as flowers like roses and lilies, a fountain of clear water, and an enclosed garden. Here we see an added view of Toledo on the bottom left of the painting. For an atmosphere of divinity, El Greco has depicted the supernatural simultaneous glowing of the sun and the moon. When comparing the two paintings to one another, the time gap in their production is visible in how El Greco's stylistic preferences become exaggerated. Towards the later years of his career, his style progresses into one that overlooks proportion, scale, atmospheric perspective, realistic anatomy, and color blending. His figures become radically elongated and possess an ethereal, ghostly skin tone. These details act in contrast to the lifelike floral still life they are set against to communicate the metamorphosis from the earthly and the divine. thumb El Greco, The Visitation, (1610‚Äì13), oil on canvas, 96 x 72.4 cm, Dumbarton Oaks, Washington 250x250px Technique and Influence In accordance to his training in Venice, as well as his preference that opposed Northern Italy's focus on design over color, El Greco held the belief that the color used in a composition is superior to its form. The works of his later years contain figural depictions that are more theatrical than descriptive in their forms. Without being melodramatic, El Greco manages to convey pathos in his ecclesial renderings. His tendency to stretch out his figures is amplified in his altarpiece works. In his completion of The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception, El Greco had requested that the altarpiece be lengthened so as to not compromise the length of the Virgin's figure. Despite the criticism El Greco faced during the span of his artistic career, especially in his later years, his works found admirers and inspired the innovations of artists from the 19th century onward. Beginning with artists such as Eug√®ne Delacroix and √âdouard Manet, who were drawn to his use of color and expression, the creative correspondence continued into the 20th century. His muddling of space and the forms which occupy it became a pictorial device later employed by modern artists such as Paul C√©zanne and Pablo Picasso. This allowed El Greco to be accredited as being the forefather of Expressionism and Cubism. The symbolists were influenced by the reserved figural expression the old master portrayed in his pictures, referencing them for their own works. Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis, literary artists, were bemused to write by the mystical character rumored (by scholars) as one having been possessed by El Greco in addition to the artworks he produced. A collection of poetic works by Rilke, (Himmelfahrt Mariae I.II., 1913), were written after the poet had viewed The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception.Naqvi-Peters, F. (1997).

Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/233511859 Contemporary artists as well, such as Kysa Johnson, in her specific use of The Virgin of the Immaculate Conception as a basis for her works, have been influenced by the 16th-and-early-17th-century artist.

The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The first cross-country railway line in NSW, connecting the southern and western lines, was proposed as early as 1875, with Surveyor Wade instructed to explore the country between Murrumburrah and Blayney to recommend a suitable route. Two similar routes were considered: one leaving the western line near the summit between Newbridge and Blayney, following the Evans Swamp Valley and the ridge near Waugoola Creek. The alternative was a line further west and in flatter country, between the Waugoola and Limestone creeks to the east of Cowra and continuing past Young before joining the southern line.Forsyth, 1985; Ryan, 1986 A later proposal (1879), this time by Surveyor Hogg, recommended that the branch line leave the western line 1.005 kilometres beyond Blayney station, passing through Carcoar and going directly through, rather than above, the town of Young. Construction of the cross-country line was approved by Parliament in April 1881 and a contract for the first stage of works to the first section of line from Murrumburrah to Young let to Messrs. O'Rourke and McSharry in September 1882. The work was to be completed by December 1884 but did not open until March 1885.Forsyth, 1985; Ryan 1986 The rest of the cross- country line was constructed in two sections (Young to Cowra and Cowra to Blayney) with tenders called for both sections in February 1885 for completion by June 1887. The successful contractor for the Cowra to Blayney section was J. S. Robertson with the contract for the section from Young to Cowra let to Fishburn & Co. The first sod for the Blayney - Cowra section was turned in Blayney in March 1885 by the widow of Andrew Lynch, the former member for the electorate of Carcoar, who had been a strong advocate for construction of the line. The Young to Cowra section opened as a temporary terminus on November 1, 1886. The section between Cowra and Blayney (including Woodstock) was delayed due to late arrival of materials for the bridge over the Lachlan River at Cowra, but opened on February 13, 1888.Forsyth, 1985; Ryan, 1986; SRA, 1993 Rail services to Woodstock (and other stations on the line) were suspended in .Ryan, 1986; SRA, 1993  Description  Extant items at Woodstock include the type 4, timber, 3rd class station building (1888), brick and concrete platform face, station seat, and station signs. There are also some relics in the former goods yard. The station building is a weatherboard structure which includes a gabled roof with galvanized corrugated sheeting, two brick chimneys, and bargeboards with finials at gable ends. There is an attached platform awning with metal roof, metal posts and decorative brackets. The platform side of the building is notable for a lack of fenestration, with five double hung sash windows provided on the road side of the building and few windows on the platform side. The internal arrangement of the building features six main rooms all accessed from the platform. A jib crane with brick base, loading bank, and remains of a storage bin (possibly for coal) were reported to exist in the adjacent yard and former loco depot, though at the time of writing the station's entry on the State Heritage Register it was unclear as to whether they were located outside the heritage listing boundary.  Heritage listing  The railway station at Woodstock is a good representative example of a type 4 (third class), late nineteenth century, timber station building that retains a good level of intactness. The railway station is an elegant, restrained weatherboard building which includes a notable veranda awning. It is an important element within the townscape of Woodstock, being located in a prominent position in the centre of the town. The station building, loading bank and jib crane demonstrate the former use of the place as a passenger station and goods yard dating back to the 1880s. Woodstock railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The station building, loading bank and jib crane at Woodstock date back to the arrival of the railway in Woodstock and surrounding districts in the 1880s, a period of rapid expansion of the government railway network throughout NSW.

It is also known as Corowa Railway Station and yard group. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  First explored by Charles Sturt in 1838, the Corowa-Wahgunyah area was rapidly taken up as squatting runs. The most influential settler was John Foord, son of a well-known Parramatta coach- builder, who was attracted by the district when he was overlanding cattle from the Monaro to Victoria in 1839 and immediately returned to take up , straddling the Murray River. Agriculture, with wheat and tobacco, developed and the gold rushes of the 1850s (including one at Corowa) created a new, significant market. Foord was encouraged in 1856 to lay out a private town on the Victorian side of the river, called Wahgunyah, and in 1857 he bought Henry Hopwood's Echuca punt when Hopwood built his pontoon bridge there. The punt was installed at Wahgunyah but was replaced in 1863 by a privately owned wooden toll-bridge operated by a company headed by John Foord. The bridge was decisive in encouraging urban development on the New South Wales side, where North Wahgunyah, Foord's second private town, became Corowa. The customs houses at the Corowa bridge handled large amounts of wool and the wheat and oats crops were very substantial in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.  Description  The complete comprises a type 4 station building of standard roadside brick, built in 1892. Other structures include a brick platform face, also completed in 1892; a water column; and a water tank.  Heritage listing  Corowa is an excellent example of a country terminus site with buildings constructed during the transition phase from early railway construction to the standardisation that took place after the 1888 Railways Act and the Eddy administration which followed. The station building in particular is an excellent example of a small country station which retains its original form and detail where most similar structures have been altered.

Beginnings He was born on 17 May 1955 in Potchefstroom. He completed his school career at Potchefstroom Gimnasium. Eloff completed his undergraduate studies in Law and Theology at Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education and later a PhD (Theology) at Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education He was a Pastor in the Reformed Church of South Africa. Reconciler of the democratic process The Dakar Conference was held on 9 to 12 July 1987. It occurred in Dakar, Senegal. It discussed strategies for bringing change in South Africa regarding: national coherence, Government structures and the economy with the African National Congress (ANC). The ANC was still banned by South African Government in 1987. Eloff was part of the Institute for Democratic Alternatives in South Africa (IDASA) delegation. Vice‚ÄìChancellor of the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education / North-West University He was the Vice-Chancellor of the university from 2002 to 2014. In 2004 the former Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education university merged with the Mafikeng University to form the North-West University with 3 campuses, one each at Vereeniging, Potchefstroom and Mafikeng. Mafikeng became later known as Mahikeng. It is now called North-West University. It was Eloff who had to execute this merger. The merger was forced on Eloff by former Education Minister Kader Asmal after Eloff refused to remove the \\"Christian Higher Education\\" from the name of the Potchefstroom University. It was not initially Asmal's plan to merge Potchefstroom University. The Merger Mess Controversy On 12 September 2008 the newspaper Mail & Guardian reported on the \\"merger mess\\" . Professor Barney Pityana, Vice-Chancellor of the University of South Africa was quoted by the Mail & Guardian to have said that at Eloff's university, \\"the new institution is unmanageable\\". A subsequent government investigation, published in 2009 in the Government Gazette, described a failed merger, in the words of Dutch academics Boersma and Wells (p.97) \\"a picture of a hopelessly divided university, inhabited by both demoralized and detached students and staff, ruled by a management that is either incapable or unwilling to see this reality, and lacks the policy framework to infuse diversity into the institution as an instrument of effective transformation and equity.\\" . In early 2014 Eloff had to resign as Vice-Chancellor when it became apparent that a far-right fascist atmosphere reigned on campus, with students being initiated with Nazi-salutes. Photos of the Nazi-salutes, and an account of a lecturer that was victimized and pushed out of the NWU by Eloff and his managers because she dared raise questions about these far-rightwing practices, can be read on Medium.. His position, which was already precarious by 2008, had finally become untenable. Following his resignation, Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande lashed out against Eloff, saying that Eloff was \\"not committed to addressing the violation of human rights at this institution‚Äù. His successor is Professor Dan Kgwadi The Controversy around Dan Kgwadi One year after his resignation from the North-West University, Eloff was still murking the waters of the institution with criticism against his successor, Professor Dan Kgwadi. Eloff criticised Kgwadi, stating that \\"\\"Dan Kgwadi is the biggest professional disappointment of my life. It's bad to say that of your successor, but with Kgwadi I momentarily lost my judgement. I thought he was the best man to lead the North West University.\\" It has been suggested that one reason for Eloff's cricisim against Kgwadi was because Kgwadi instituted a forensic investigation into claims that Eloff was linked to a donation of R10m to a trust that was allegedly done without permission from the university's council. In response, a group of NWU students and workers reacted strongly, writing in an open letter that \\"\\"We are not surprised that you and other white Afrikaner neo-colonialist academics are not in favour of Prof Kgwadi‚Äôs transformational agenda and plan to deracialise Pukke.\\" Executive Director FW de Klerk Foundation Eloff was appointed as Executive Director of the Foundation on 1 July 2016. FW de Klerk is a past president of South Africa, a former leader of the Nationalist Party (the party who instituted the policy of Grand Apartheid), a former Chancellor of the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education. He is also a controversial Nobel Peace Prize winner. De Klerk founded the Foundation to: *Promoted the South Africa Constitution, and support the Bill of Rights. These two together with the rule of law are executed through the Centre for Constitutional Rights. *Work to obtain unity in diversity through the Centre for Unity in Diversity. *It also supports children with disadvantages and disabilities by means of charitable support. Controversy at the FW de Klerk Foundation In February 2020 the FW de Klerk Foundation was widely condemned when Mr. de Klerk said in an interview with the BBC that apartheid was not a crime against humanity. In a statement defending this view, the FW de Klerk Foundation argued on 14 February 2020 that describing apartheid as a crime against humanity was simply \\"an agitprop project initiated by the Soviet Union\\". The Foundation and Mr. de Klerk later apologised after a furore broke out. Eloff stated after this that \\"I don't believe there will be a change in leadership at the foundation\\". However, Eloff resigned from the Foundation' Board of Trustees on 30th April 2020. Controversy over COVID-19 in South Africa Eloff voiced his strong opposition against the lockdown measures instituted by the South African government in order to stem the spread of COVID-19 in the country. As reported , Eloff called on the South African government \\"don't extend lockdown even for another day\\", despite the country having one of the highest incidences of the pandemic in the world. Soon after, it was reported that Eloff tested positive for COVID-19 . South Africa is one of the world's worst COVID-19 affected countries, with 545,000 confirmed cases by the first week of August 2020. Personal life He is married to Suzette van der Westhuizen . He has two daughters and three granddaughters. Award Honorary Doctorate of Law, by the London South Bank University, UK in 2008. Book He wrote a book called Wat Nou, Suid-Afrika?\\", later translated as Turning Point about how to create the society that we want. He based this on what he has learned through the Dakar Conference to being the Vice‚ÄìChancellor up to being involved in the FW de Klerk Foundation.

The castle stands at the bottom of the valley of the River Gryfe on a peninsula created by the Blacketty and Green Waters which have their confluence beyond the two deep gorges. History The gorge of the Burnbank Burn. The castle was held from the 12th century by the Lyle, L'Isle, Lyell or Insula family who had first settled in Northumberland. Ralph de Insula of Duchal is recorded in the reign of Alexander II (1198 ‚Äì 1249) and he may have built the first castle here. In the mid 15th century Lord Lyle was ennobled by James II and a successor, Sir Robert Lyle became Lord Chief Justice and a Privy Councillor to James III. Lord Lyle had died in 1470 and his heiress had married Alexander Lyle of Craigbate. In 1513 James IV and his natural son James (see below), Archbishop of St Andrews, both died at the Battle of Flodden. The title of Lord Lyle passed to the descendants of Sir Neil Montgomerie of Lainshaw near Stewarton who had married Jean, daughter of the 4th Lord Lyle. Evidence of the old feudal baronial court is to be found in the place name 'Moothill' located near East Green in John Thomson's Atlas of Scotland, 1832. The name 'Duchal' is often written as 'Duchall' on old maps, etc. Siege and later history A section of the curtain wall on the Green Water side. Robert Lyle, 2nd Lord Lyle fought against the king at the Battle of Sauchieburn in 1488 and in 1489 he supported the Lennox rebellion resulting in James IV besieging Duchal, which had been garrisoned by the Earl of Lennox in 1488, local tradition holding that Mons Meg was used as had been the case at Crookston Castle and Dumbarton Castle. A second cannon was also employed and this became known as 'Duchal'. The king himself attended the siege at some point and nine Dutch pirates are known to have volunteered as an alternative to hanging. The sheriffs had to provide oxen to haul the guns to Duchal and the king obtained at Paisley who came to the castle with mattocks and spades. The siege only lasted a few days. The lands of Duchal were forfeited, the castle was repaired and held for a time by Robert Cunningham, 2nd Lord Kilmaurs and later 2nd Earl of Glencairn, however Sir Robert managed to return to the king's favour and even became Lord Chief Justice for a second time in 1492. In 1544 Duchal Castle passed to the John Porterfield of Porterfield by purchase on the death of John de Lyle, 3rd Lord Lyle. Jean Knox of Ranfurly, retired to their old seat of Porterfield in 1575 upon her husband's death and subsequently the family used the property as a dower house. Duchal passed to Lord Melfort by Crown grant however it was returned to the Porterfields of that Ilk. In 1578 Duchal was attacked and burnt as part of a family feud by James Cunningham, Master of Glencairn (later the 7th Earl of Glencairn), attacked and burnt down Duchal Castle as part of a feud between the Cunninghams and the Porterfields. The damage appears to have been repaired as the castle remained in use for some time afterwards. Duchal Castle in 1701 is recorded as partly ruinous and Catherine Boyd, wife of Alexander Porterfield is said to have built Duchal House as his wife, daughter of the Earl of Kilmarnock, regarded the old castle in its wooded location to be cold, damp and unsuited to comfortable living. Duchal had been reduced to a substantial ruin by 1782 however the castle's draw well (slop shute or garderobe) and drawbridge survived. The castle gradually declined in importance until the family started afresh at the site of 'New Duchal'. A substantial number of human bones are recorded to have been found in an upper apartment during the dismantling of the now abandoned fortifications. A summerhouse was built on the River Gryfe using stones recycled from the old fortifications and the remains of a rectangular building between the inner and outer bailey may be the remains of this building. Marion Boyd and Alexander Stewart James IV kept and often visited one of his mistresses, Marion Boyd of Bonshaw at Duchal, having a son, Alexander Stewart with her, born in 1497 at the castle. On a visit here from Glasgow on 22 February 1497 the king commanded that money be left for Marion and his baby son giving eighteen shillings \\"to the noris that fosterit Marioun Boydis barne and fourteen to a harper.\\" She later married John Mure of Rowallan Castle. The King celebrated his twenty-fifth birthday at Duchal on 17 March 1498 and enacted a Deed or Revocation here. Description The well/slop shute/garderobe/postern gate from the Green Water Gorge. The castle's curtain walls follow much of the edge of the raised peninsula with its continuous precipitous and mainly vertical drop into the rivulets on either side. The courtyard is fairly level and was divided into an inner and outer bailey. At the western end of the site a deep ditch crossed by a drawbridge with a gatehouse helped defend the ground level access off what is now a narrow country lane, some traces of this ditch survive. On the north-eastern side is a prominent stone lined well (take care if visiting), slop shoot or garderobe gives access to the Burnbank Burn gorge and shows evidence of having been reduced in size as some stage for defensive reasons (See photograph). This feature may have once been a postern gate with steps down. Two or possibly three 16th century wide-mouthed gun loops can still be seen in the courtyard wall. The thickness of these curtain walls suggests a 13th-century date. On the south-eastern side, overlooking the deep Blacketty Burn gorge, is a rocky outcrop that stands circa 20 ft above the courtyard floor with visible masonry foundations and this was the site of the keep, possibly a later structure of 14th or 15th century date, however too little remains to validate this. The main entrance and gatehouse was at the north-western angle and two postern gates also existed, one at the northern end that was accessed via steps from the courtyard and the other at the eastern end leading to the end of the peninsula. At the north-west are the likely remains of a window associated with a lean to structure. The name 'Duchal' imay translate as 'Two Rivers'. The Covenant The Porterfields were supporters of the Covenanters and eventually suffered by forfeiture and imprisonment in 1684, the laird becoming known as Melfort's Martyr. Lord Melfort had pursued the case against the Porterfields with great vigour and he was granted the family estates which he held for a short time before they were returned and he fled the country. Before 'Duchal' was arrested and tried an incident took place where two of Melfort's spies came to Duchal and pretended to be fellow Covenanters in need of food and shelter which they were duly given, however Lady Duchal suspected them and had them watched, upon which it was observed that they did not say grace before eating. Lady Duchal informed her husband who had them seized, bound and severely whipped before placing them in an old vault where they lay until an officer collected them. Duchal House Duchal House was built to the east of the castle (NS353680) by the Porterfields in 1710 and as was the custom much of the carved stone, etc. was robbed and used in the new building. Duchal House is still occupied and despite various additions the present structure may incorporate part of the 1710 building. References ;Notes ;Sources *Coventry, Martin (2010).

The picture depicts Christ in a moment of personal reflection as he carries the cross to his death, therefore committing the ultimate sacrifice for humankind. In the painting, Christ's eyes are lifted up to the heavens as he begins his walk towards his crucifixion. His gentle hands wrap around the cross as a stormy night floods the background. Christ Carrying the Cross is an oil painting, 105x79cm. The painting, one of numerous similar paintings by El Greco, is currently in the El Greco room in the New York art collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  El Greco   Summary of life  Born in 1541 in Crete, El Greco's official name is Dom√©nikos Theotok√≥poulos. El Greco acquired this name while living in Italy, no doubt studying the classical style of art. In Italy, El Greco lived in Venice, and studied under Titian, one of the most profound Italian Renaissance artists. After three years, El Greco moved from Venice to Rome to continue his studies and works under the patronage of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. While in Rome, Greco continued to develop his own personal artistic style, combining the styles of the Byzantine era, the Renaissance era, and the Mannerist era. To read a full version of El Greco's life, history, and artistic style click here.  Painting style and technique  Because he combined the stylistic ideas of three different eras and conceptions of art, El Greco's paintings were truly unique. Overall, they captivated a new essence about the idea of the body. Greco's figures often were lengthy, elongated forms that felt almost fluid in nature. His painting usually carried the notion of Romanticism, focusing on the suffering and love through pain and contention. El Greco also was inspired by the techniques and ideals of the Renaissance period, specifically the idea that a perfect human body was a pure connection to the divine. Most of Greco's works featured figures that related to this divine and iconoclastic sense of being. However, El Greco's figures were often distorted and elongated, contrasting the sheer proportionate perfection of the Renaissance bodily form. Instead, his paintings and works connected to a divine presence by through strong, visual, emotional appeals. This reflection of strong and purposeful emotion stems from the Mannerist age, captivating the idea of an aggressive, emotional, and almost violent perspective and strong emotional whirlwind to captive the narration and feeling behind the piece. This was often the structural layout in most of Greco's works.

Establishing an aesthetic color palette was sometimes more important than the actual figure itself. Greco often had a tendency to use deep, full, rich colors to motivate the emotional expression in the piece to affect the viewers mood. The saturated hues of navy, black, purple, and red allowed for the viewer to be taken to another dimension. Greco's use of color captivates a sense of wrathfulness and divine devotion that seems other worldly. The main idea of Greco's painting style was to dramatize the narration, emotion, and message of each piece. El Greco often used oil paints on canvas. Provenance The painting, Christ Carrying the Cross, had been owned by Sir William Stirling Maxwell (1818‚Äì1878), General Archibald Stirling, and Lieutenant Colonel William Stirling. In 1953 it was acquired by Robert Lehman, and in 1975 it was acquired as part of his collection by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It is on view in the Met museum's Gallery 958.  The artwork   Details of the work  In Christ Carrying the Cross, there are a multitude of minute details that help narrate the raw, expressive emotion of the work. Overall, the aching look in Christ's eyes show both a plea for mercy and an understanding of what is to come. The painting itself was inspired by and parallels Michelangelo's Risen Christ. The work also relates directly to the Northern Italian narration of the way to calvary. This narration allows the artist to express the human emotions of Christ rather than his projected divine expression. In this work, the Northern Italian per narration allows Christ to beg for mercy while also having an understanding of his role in God's plan to forgive humankind for their sins. In addition to Christ's emotional expression, the Northern Italian narration of the crucifixion story allowed Christ to be an isolated being, separated from the whirlwind of the crowd surrounding his crucifixion. On the way to calvary, Christ is carrying the cross to his own crucifixion in Jerusalem. This painting depicts a moment along the way where Christ stops amid a storm to communicate and reflect to the heavens before committing the ultimate sacrifice for humankind. = Christ = Many of the emotional details in this piece are shown in Christ himself. Below is a table elaborating on a few details from the painting that assist with the narration of the piece. {  +Details of Christ !Detail of the work: !Location of the detail: !Meaning of the detail: !Source: - Tears in Christ's gaze Christ's eyes The oversized tears in Christ's eyes demonstrate the moment where Christ is both pleading to the heavens and accepting his fate and sacrifice for humankind. Christ's tears are a direct expression to human emotion, relating to the tenderness and expressiveness of humankind, connecting both on a narrational and divine level. Paragraph 4 https://www.elgreco.net/christ-carrying-the-cross.jsp - Crown of Thorns On top of Christ's head The crown of thorns was placed on Christ's head as a mockery from the guards. The guards were taunting Jesus, as he lay nailed to the cross, nagging him for being the King of the Jews. However, the crown no longer has a negative association. The crown now demonstrates that Christ died a king. In addition, the thorns and blood represent the outcast and torture of Christ leading up to his crucifixion. https://www.gotquestions.org/crown-of- thorns.html - Implied line Gaze to the heavens An implied line is a suggested connection between two object on the same plane. In this case, Christ's line of sight is directed towards the heavens. Because of the strong cultural association with eye contact, it becomes the strongest form of an implied line. It allows the connection from an individual to pierce through to another object. In this work, by looking up, Christ is affirming and connecting to the God moments before his crucifixion. https://artsandculture.google.com/usergallery/implied-lines/-QIS4P1SqwUOLQ } An alternate portrayal of Jesus calming the storm: Christ at the Sea of Galilee - Tintoretto = Background = The background of Christ Carrying the Cross is an overwhelming storm: lightning, thunder, and possible rain. The clouds gather in dark hues to darken the mood and narration of the piece. Usually, storms are associated with feelings of fear and unease: both feelings that are highly applicable to the human nature of this portrait. The storm clouds also have breaks of light, allowing the viewer to understand Christ's acceptance of his sacrifice as he communicates and reflects with the heavens. Often, Christ imagery is associated with a biblical passage or text. In this case, the background illustrates Matthew 8:23-27. In this text, Christ reminds the disciples of their faith, even in moments of struggle and fear. This same narration is shown in Christ Carrying the Cross. Although the storm seems to be raging in the background in a moment of death, Christ reminds us that God is with us and is with him at all times. There is no need to have doubt or fear in the eyes of the Lord. = Christ and cross imagery = This painting is a prime example of religious imagery. Not only does the work feature Christ, a religious, iconoclastic figure, but it also displays an array of biblical passages and narratives throughout the work. As mentioned earlier, the background of the piece demonstrates Matthew 8:23-27. The actual narration of the crucifixion is written about in all four gospels of the Bible: Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John.

Am image from an Edo period scroll produced in 1728 of a man pressing mother coins into a sand mould to produce the imprints for cash coins in the mint of the Sendai Domain. Mother coins (), alternatively known as seed coins or matrix coins, were coins used during the early stages of the casting process to produce Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Ryukyuan, and Vietnamese cash coins. As cash coins were produced using sand casting mother coins were first produced to form the basis for all subsequent cash coins to be released into circulation. Under the Han dynasty in China mints started producing cash coins using bronze master moulds to solve inconsistencies in circulating coins, this only worked partially and by the sixth century mother coins were introduced to solve these inconsistencies almost completely. The Japanese adopted the usage of mother coins in the 600s and they were used to manufacture cast Japanese coins until the Meiji period. The mother coin was initially prepared by engraving a pattern with the legend of the cash coin which had to be manufactured. In the manufacturing process mother coins were used to impress the design in moulds which were made from easily worked metals such as tin and these moulds were then placed in a rectangular frame made from pear wood filled with fine wet sand, possibly mixed with clay, and enhanced with either charcoal or coal dust to allow for the molten metal to smoothly flow through, this frame would act as a layer that separates the two parts of the coin moulds. The mother coin was recovered by the people who cast the coins and was placed on top of the second frame and the aforementioned process was repeated until fifteen layers of moulds had formed based on this single mother coin. After cooling down a \\"coin tree\\" (Èå¢Ê®π) or long metallic stick with the freshly minted cash coins attached in the shape of \\"branches\\" would be extracted from the mould and these coins could be broken off and if necessary had their square holes chiseled clean, after this the coins were placed on a long metal rod to simultaneously remove the rough edges for hundreds of coins and then these cash coins could be strung together and enter circulation.Zuroku Nihon no kahei, vol.3 (Tokyo: Touyou Keizai Shinpousha, 1974), pp. 72-79. (in Japanese). The Sangpyeong Tongbo (Â∏∏Âπ≥ÈÄöÂØ∂) cash coins were known as yeopjeon (ËëâÈå¢, \\"leaf coins\\") because of the way that cash coins resembled leaves on a branch when they were being cast in the mould. The introduction and subsequent usage of mother coins in the casting process proved to be paramount in controlling the quality of the cash coins. Only minor differences between mother coins remained even if the carver was very skilled. If mother coins had even the slightest error than this error would be visible on every cash coin that would be produced from it, which is why mother coins with any imperfections were quickly withdrawn from the production process before impacting many coins meant for circulation. Due to the high quality control mother coins with deformities are almost never found.  Wax mother coins  Under the Sui and Tang dynasties mother coins reached their definite form and were produced in moulds engraved by ancestor coins, however during this same period a casting technique called \\"the lost wax method\\" was used to cast for example Kaiyuan Tongbao cash coins, in this method mother coins made from wax rather than metal were used, these mother coins were produced in large quantities because they were very cheap to make, unlike metal mother coins these wax mother coins stayed in the clay moulds and when the mould heated up they would melt away leaving a cavity for the molten metal to pour into forming the coins. This technique was also used for casting other bronze items however it was only used for casting coinage during the Sui and Tang dynasties and its sudden discontinuation pointed out to the fact that it was probably inefficient for mass producing small items such as coins.Ancient Chinese Coins - The casting of coins during the Tang by Lars Bo Christensen.

Cast Chinese Coins. Trafford, United Kingdom: Trafford Publishing. . these ancestor coins were used to cast more mother coins and from a single ancestor thousands of mother coins could be cast. The production process of making mother coins with ancestor coins was the same as it was for the casting of circulation coins from mother coins, however these coins were usually only produced for a new reign title, when preparing to cast new cash coins with new inscriptions for a recently ascended emperor, a mint would first engrave an ancestor coin out of fine brass which would form the basis for mother coins. The introduction of ancestor coins under the Manchu Qing dynasty lead to all mints having more consistently produced coinages and smaller variations between the coins produced by separate mints in both inscription (or legend) as well as in quality.Coin.shouxi.com Ê∏ÖÈí±ÂêçÁèç:Á•∫Á••ÈáçÂÆùÊ∫êÂçÅÊØçÈí± ÊñπÂ≠îÈí±ÊúÄÂêéÈ´òÂ≥∞ http://www.shouxi.com 2013-08-31 10:12 È¶ñÂ∏≠Êî∂ËóèÁΩë ÂèëË°®ËØÑËÆ∫.

Iutsushi (Japanese: Èã≥ÂÜô„Åó) is a Japanese term that could be translated as \\"to cast a copy from\\", this refers to a technique where regular circulating cash coins were used as mother coins, this was a very common practice in Japan until the seventeenth century and mostly Chinese cash coins from the Song and Ming dynasties were used. Outside of Japan this technique was also largely used to produce counterfeit currency by illegal Chinese and private Vietnamese mints, as the cash coins produced by using the Iutsushi technique were less crisp than their mother coins, often have smooth reverses, and the fact that these coins shrunk after metal had cooled down, Iutsushi coins are also diminutive in size compared to the original circulating coins and the inscriptions are also inferior in quality as they display more softer and quite blurry. For these reasons the cash coins produced using this technique were among the cash coins known as Bitasen (ÈêöÈä≠) or bad metal coins in Japan. Due to Iutsushi it‚Äôs often very hard to distinguish Japanese Bitasen from Chinese counterfeit cash coins as well as privately produced cash coins from Vietnam as many of these used the same inscriptions and it's not uncommon for there to be large variations in both the quality and metal content of original coins that have been heavily circulated.Masuo Tomifusa, Honpou bitasen zufu, (Anasendou 1982).

It combined the main non-Labor forces, the \\"Kidstonites\\" of William Kidston and the Conservatives of Robert Philp, similar to the federal Commonwealth Liberal Party whose fusion it preceded. The Liberals held government from their formation in 1908 until defeat in 1915 after which they combined with other elements in the state to form the National Party. History The Liberals were formed after a period of flux in Queensland state politics in which multiple parties and factions had operated with both the 1907 and 1908 elections returning Legislative Assemblies with three groupings of approximately equal weight. William Kidston had served as Premier of Queensland since 1906, breaking with the Labor Party in 1907 to form his own \\"Kidstonites\\" grouping. The Kidstonites initially governed with the external support of Labor but in the two broke over bills on private railway construction which relied on the support of Robert Philp's Conservative faction. Increasingly the Kidstonites and the Conservatives were drawn together and, following a trip by Kidston to the United Kingdom, in October 1908 the two groups merged; this merger preceded the similar federal merger of anti-Labor forces as the Commonwealth Liberal Party by seven months. However not all of the Kidstonite MLAs accepted the merger, and a group called the \\"Independent Opposition\\" emerged, headed by former Attorney General James Blair and including former Labor leaders Peter Airey and George Kerr. The fused party revived the name \\"Liberals\\", previously used by the followers of Samuel Griffith, Premier in the 1880s & 1890s. Kidston became leader of the new party whilst Philp retired to the backbenches, although other prominent followers of his such as Digby Denham served in the cabinet. The new party governed for a year before another state election at which they increased their number of seats whilst the Independent Opposition was reduced to a small remnant. The government pushed further reforms including electoral reform based on reasonably equal sized electorates and the consolidation & simplification of land legislation. In early 1911 Kidston retired from politics, to be succeeded by Denham. The same year saw the creation of the People's Progressive League, an extra-parliamentary organisation to support the government. Under Denham the party faced a number of divisions. Rural Liberals organised internally as the Farmers' Parliamentary Union, expressing discontent that would later boil over and lead to the emergence of a separate party. A liquor bill was blocked by the Queensland Legislative Council in 1911 and a major constitutional crisis and split in the Liberals was only averted due to a tramway and general strike in Brisbane that began in January 1912. Denham took a hard law & order line against the strike, even when the federal government declined his request to supply armed forces. An early election was called in April at which the Liberals increased their seats, albeit with losses in Brisbane.The government passed the Industrial Peace Act that took a hard line against the unions. The government took an increasingly hardline approach in the face of a revived Labor Party, but faced declining popularity. In 1914 compulsory voting was introduced for state elections in the hope of shoring up support. However the party continued to stumble. Rural discontent continued with the result that in the 1915 election dissatisfaction with the Denham government led to the Queensland Farmers' Union running its own candidates, five of whom were elected and formed a distinct separate Country Party grouping in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. The 1915 election saw the Liberals swept from power, losing over half their seats with Denham himself and many other ministers personally defeated. In opposition the party was briefly led by Edward Macartney, and then by James Tolmie, both former ministers. The impact of Labor winning the election and their actions in government resulted in the opposition forces soon looking to ally. The National Political Council was formed in 1916 to co-ordinate activities between opposition groups and proved the foundation for further integration. The Australian Labor Party split of 1916 had only a minor impact in the state with Premier T. J. Ryan working hard to successfully keep the party together in the state with only limited losses and instead the emphasis remained on the opposition groups with the Liberals and Country Party coming together in July 1917 as the National Party. Tolmie became the leader of the new party. Leaders {  - ! Leader ! Date started !

It was designed by John Whitton in his capacity as Engineer-in-Chief for Railways. The bridge was built from 1886 to 1887 by contractors Fishburn & Co. It is also known as the Cowra Rail Bridge over Lachlan River and the Cowra Lattice Railway Bridge. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History Tenders for the section of line including the bridge were advertised in February 1885. The bridge was completed in sixteen months, with no accidents even though it was at the time the highest bridge in New South Wales. A temporary bridge to facilitate access for contractors and machinery had to be erected, and work proceeded even though the river was in partial flood at several times during works. The official opening of the Young-Cowra section of line took place on 25 August 1886; however, trains could only proceed as far as the river, as the bridge works were not complete. The last rivet was placed in June 1877, and the bridge was opened to passengers for the first time on 9 September 1877.  Description  The Cowra Rail Bridge over the Lachlan River is a three-span continuous iron lattice bridge. The spans are to centres of piers and the lattice work has four triangulations. The piers are pairs of cast iron cylinders (supplied by Stockton Forge Co, England). The bridge has wrought iron plate web girders at each end of the lattice bridge. Apart from relatively minor technical works of repair and strengthening, the bridge retains its original fabric.  Significance  During the 20-year period 1873-1893 there was a massive program of public works in New South Wales, particularly in expanding the road and rail networks. It was a boom period that ended with a severe economic depression. Despite the boom conditions, the respective Chief Engineers, for Roads (William C. Bennett) and for Railways (John Whitton) were constrained to economise by using as much local material as possible, consequently an enormous amount of hardwood timber was used for bridge works, mostly timber beam and timber truss bridges. However, there were many major rivers to be crossed, requiring long span bridges, for which no form of timber bridge was suitable. These large bridges had to be metal and supplied from England, a very expensive import cost to the successive colonial governments. Both Chief Engineers were British so they chose the widely used wrought iron lattice truss bridge in the half-through form. Twelve of these were built for the railways and 24 for roads. These two sets of iron lattice bridges are the most significant group of bridges of the colonial period. A high percentage are extant and still in use, 11 on railways and 18 on roads. The current railway lattice bridges are: * 1876Bathurst Rail Bridge over Macquarie River - still standing but no longer in use * 1881Macquarie River at Wellington * 1882Peel River at Tamworth * 1882MacDonald River at Woolbrook * 1884Rail Bridge over Murray River, Albury-Wodonga * 1884Macquarie River Railway Bridge, Dubbo * 1885Murrumbidgee River at Narrandera * 1887Lachlan River at Cowra. Two former railway lattice bridges (1885 Georges River at Como and the 1886 Meadowbank Rail Bridge over Parramatta River) were converted for use by pedestrian/cycle ways. The 1871 lattice railway bridge over the Hunter River at Aberdeen was replaced by steel girders and demolished. The 1881 Murrumbidgee River at Wagga Wagga was demolished in 2004 and replaced with a concrete structure.  Heritage listing  Cowra was reached by rail in 1886, the line extending from Young. The bridge built in 1886 is one of the original iron lattice Whitton bridges and is an important surviving element from the most significant period of railway development. It is an excellent example in an important railway town. The building of such a relatively large structure on this cross country line reflects the importance that the railway administration gave to this line to provide an outlet for coal from Lithgow, and produce from central NSW, to reach the south and Victoria and vice versa. The bridge is a member of the most significant group of colonial bridges in New South Wales. Collectively, as items of railway infrastructure, they contributed significantly to the history and development of New South Wales. Each bridge is an imposing structure at its site. In terms of contemporary bridge technology the wrought iron lattice bridge was among the best for major bridgeworks. Cowra rail bridge over Lachlan River was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Twelve wrought iron lattice railway bridges were built in New South Wales during the boom period for railway construction 1871-1887, starting at Aberdeen and ending at Cowra. Nine of the survivors are owned and managed by the Rail Access Corporation. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. All nine iron lattice railway bridges are imposing structures. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Every iron lattice railway bridge crossed a major river which made it possible for the railway extension to develop the districts reached, socially and commercially. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Collectively, the iron lattice railway bridges represent a significant class of bridge structure.

Center Parcs' Le Lac d'Ailette residence is located on the side of the lake.  Environment and fauna  20 ha of marsh, 200 ha of coppicing and 100 of barren vegetation and meadows disappeared due to the implementation of the lake. Yet the site hosts numerous bird species. In December 1987, 107 Aves-class animals were censed. This number rose to 116 as of December 1988. More recently, between February 1999 and February 2007, Daniel Baverel identified 177 species on the site; this analysis showed that 207 bird species have ever been present on site, including 76 nesting birds. Also, the lake hosts several species that are rare in Picardy, including Najas marina, Groenlandia densa, claspingleaf pondweed, northern pike, Caenis lactea and emerald damselfly. The lac de l'Ailette is protected as a natural zone of ecological interest, fauna and flora.

It is a terminal station for the Kaliningrad ‚Äî Svetlogorsk railway. Electric trains ES1 Lastochka and ET2M make a passenger trips from Svetlogorsk-II. The station is located in the town center.  History  The station Rauschen-D√ºne was opened on 6 May 1906 with the construction of the branch line from Rauschen-Ort (now Svetlogorsk-I railway station). Rauschen-D√ºne station was more convenient for passengers, as unlike Rauschen-Ort station it is located in the city center. In the 1920s, the popularity of the resort increased. There was a boom in construction. Building materials were removed to Rauschen by trains. The number of passenger trains also increased to 12-15 at the weekend. At the end of the Second World War, the rolling stock was removed from East Prussia. Tracks, overpasses, water and power equipment were put out of order. Repair works continued until 1947. After the war the first train from Kaliningrad arrived to Svetlogorsk-II station in 1947. New station building was built in 1975. It was decorated with three-dimensional mosaic reliefs in the style of socialist realism by the works of artists Nikolai Frolov, Oleg Atroshchenko and Albert Shestakov. Svetlogorsk-II station was electrified DC and equipped with automatic train protection in 1976. By the 2000s the station building not only needed major repairs, but also ceased to meet the aesthetic and architectural requirements of the main resort of the region and the requirements for stations with intensive passenger traffic. In December 2006, a new station building was constructed. It has a waiting room for 150 people, six ticket offices, buffets and rest rooms.

Description and history The Samuel Beach House is located east of Branford Center, on the north side of East Main Street just east of Beach Place. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. The roof has a steep 45¬∞ pitch that is unusual for the period, and is slight flared at the cornices. The main facade is five bays wide, with a symmetrical arrangement of windows around a center entrance. The window tops butt against trim pieces that extend the width of the facade. The entrance is sheltered by a shed-roof hood (a later addition); it has a double-leaf door flanked by wide sidelight windows. The second story and attic level both slightly overhang the level below. The interior does not retain many original finishes, but its basic layout remains intact, as do three fireplaces. With The house's construction was dated to 1790 by a survey of historic properties performed in the 1930s. At the time of its listing on the National Register, it was still owned within the Beach family.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. History John H. Galloway was born in Gorham, New York in 1817. He arrived in Howell in 1844 with his wife Delia Ann Brown Galloway and their two-year-old son Frederick. There, Galloway and his brother-in-law, Nathan Hickey, established the first foundry in the area, manufacturing stoves and agricultural implements. Delia Galloway died in 1845, and in 1848 John married Martha Durfee; the couple later had two sons, James and Elias. The couple built this house, likely in the early 1850s. In about 1854 Galloway sold his interest in the foundry. He continued in business, buying part-ownership in another foundry. He served as a county supervisor in 1858-60, served one term in the Michigan Senate in 1861, and served as Howell village assessor from 1863 to 1865. He was also president of the village in 1879. John and Martha lived in their house until Martha's death in 1889 and John's in 1892. As John's sons Frederick and James had predeceased him, the estate was divided among Elias Galloway and Frederick's sons Frederick R. and James R. Galloway. Elias Galloway took up residence in his parents‚Äô house, but much of his time elsewhere. He died in 1918, and his widow Elizabeth McMichael Galloway lived in the house until her death in 1936. With Elizabeth's death, the house went to James R. Galloway (his brother Frederick R. died unmarried in 1915). James sold the house in 1937 to Dr. and Mrs. Duncan C. Stephens in 1937. In 1946, the house was sold to Herbie and Doris Sneed, who immediately sold it to Herbert and Alice Schott. The Schotts sold it to John and Alice Stritzinger in 1977; they lived in the house at least until 2006. Description The Galloway House is an asymmetrical two-story Italianate brick structure with a low hip roof having widely overhanging eaves supported by paired brackets. A single-story wing projects from the rear. A full-width, flat-roofed porch runs across the front elevation, sheltering an entry flanked with pilasters, with a transom above. The house has one-over-one and two-over- two windows with low segmental-arch heads, along with a large bay window.

After World War II, he turned a former concentration camp (the Fossoli di Carpi near Modena, Emilia-Romagna) into a refuge for orphaned children. Saltini also set up a satellite community on the present site of Nomadelfia, in Maremma, Tuscany.

The properties of 2D h-BN films depends greatly on the quality of the films. It has been challenging to synthesize high-quality 2D h-BN over large areas. In particular, the small grain size of polycrystalline h-BN results in many grain boundaries, which create charge traps and higher surface roughness. The production of 2D h-BN can be divided into top-down and bottom-up approaches. In bottom-up methods, a film is grown or deposited on a surface; in top-down methods, a larger structure is reduced until the desired state or structure is achieved. Top-down methods The general idea behind top-down approaches is to take bulk h-BN, break the Van der Waals forces between the hexagonal layers and separate the resulting two-dimensional sheets of h-BN. These techniques mainly consist of mechanical and chemical exfoliation methods. In mechanical exfoliation the atomic sheets of h-BN are physically pulled or separated from each other. For example using regular adhesive tape to peel off graphene sheets is one of the most famous mechanical exfoliation methods and similar techniques can also be used to create h-BN sheets. Generally speaking mechanical exfoliation methods can be considered as simple ways to fabricate h-BN nanosheets, but their yield can be small and the size of the fabricated structures is usually limited. On the other hand, the number of defects on the produced nanosheets has been found to be smaller compared to chemical methods. Chemical exfoliation is carried out in liquid solvents such as dichloroethane and dimethylformamide. Sonication is used to break Van der Waals forces in h-BN crystals which allows the solvent molecules to expand the atomic layers. These methods are quite simple and can also provide a higher yield compared to mechanical exfoliation, although the samples are easily contaminated. Bottom-up methods Chemical vapor deposition Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a bottom-up chemical deposition method used to construct high-quality nanoscale films. In CVD, a substrate is exposed to precursors, which react on the wafer surface to produce the desired film. This reaction often also results in toxic byproducts. Historically, ultra-high vacuum CVD (UHVCVD) has been used for thin h-BN deposition on transition metals. More recently, CVD of h-BN has also been successful on metallic surfaces at higher pressures. CVD is reliant on the use of reactive precursors. For h-BN, there are gaseous, liquid, and solid options to choose from, each with their respective advantages and drawbacks. Gaseous precursors, such as BF3/NH3, BCl3/NH3, and B2H6/NH3, are toxic and require careful ratios of gases to preserve a 1:1 B/N stoichiometry. Liquid precursors, such as borazine, have equal amounts of boron and nitrogen, and do not produce highly toxic side products. However, they are sensitive to moisture, and hydrolyze readily. This drawback can be counteracted by raising the temperature, but higher temperatures also result in increased rates of reaction. Finally, for solid precursors, borazane is stable and has a 1:1 B/N stoichiometry. Its drawback is its decomposition into the highly active BH2NH2, which polymerizes at room temperature. Pure borazane consequently does not work as a precursors, and should be mixed with BH2NH2 and borazine. CVD is classified by its operation conditions into atmospheric pressure CVD (APCVD), low-pressure CVD (LPCVD) and ultra-high vacuum CVD. Higher vacuums require more sophisticated equipment, and higher operation costs, while higher pressures yield faster growth. For h-BN, APCVD has been unable to precisely control the number of layers. At least LPCVD is currently required to produce large area monolayer h-BN. The choice of substrate in CVD is important, as the film under production must stick to the surface. In h-BN, as in graphene, transition metals such as Cu or Ni are popular choices for CVD substrate materials. Platinum has also been used as a wafer, as has iron foil and cobalt. The drawback with catalytic transition metal wafer materials is the need to transfer the end result to a target substrate, such as silicon. This procedure often damages or contaminates the film. Some h-BN films have been grown on Si, SiO2/Si, and sapphire The orientation of domains on the h-BN film is affected by the choice of substrate material and its orientation. Typically, domains are triangular in LPCVD, and triangular, truncated triangular, or hexagonal in APCVD. Often, these domains are randomly oriented, but h-BN domains align strictly with copper (100) or (111) surface lattices. With Cu (110), alignment is less strict, but still strong over millimeter distances. Physical vapor deposition =Sputtering= In sputtering, a solid target of the desired film material is bombarded with energetic particles, so that a thin film can be produced on a wafer facing the target. Ar ion beams have been used to sputter h-BN on Cu foils, resulting in high- quality, few-layer films, and magnetron sputtering of B in N2/Ar has been used to grow high-quality h-BN on Ru. This process results in films two atomic layers thick; thicker films can be grown by alternating room temperature deposition and annealing cycles. Co-segregation When a source of boron and nitrogen, such as amorphous BN, is sandwiched between a Co or Ni film and SiO2, it is possible to grow an atomically thin h-BN film on the metal surface by annealing the heterostructure in a vacuum. The B and N atoms dissolve in the metal bulk, diffuse through the film, and precipitate on the surface. In this way, the use of unconventional or toxic precursors is avoided. Other methods In molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) heated gaseous elements are allowed to condense on the wafer. MBE has been used to grow h-BN films from elemental B and N on Ni foils. Molten boron oxide reacts with gaseous ammonia to form an ultrathin h-BN film at the reaction interface. The film grows to 20-30 nm in thickness, after which the process self-terminates, the setup is cooled down, and the boron oxide can be dissolved in water.

Carrier  He was born as the third child of Hermann Friedrich Krupp and his wife, Therese Wilhelmi. His brother was Alfred Krupp. After finishing his studies at the Burgplatz Royal Secondary School in Essen, he learnt in Solingen. During his spare time, he worked at his father‚Äôs shop. He became the mechanical director of Berndorfer Metallwarenfabrik in Berndorf, which was founded by his brother, Alfred. In 1847 he met with Marie Baum, daughter of the rich Daniel Baum, whom he married at the same year. They lived near the Berndorfer Metallwarenfabrik in every summer and in Vienna, Wollzeile, in front of Metallwarenfabrik. Hermann Krupp was Protestant, while his wife Marie was Catholic. To reflect it, sons were Protestants, daughters became Catholics. They had six children all together. Hermann Krupp was fond of his work, and had a good relationship with his employee, who were loyal to him. Based on that Revolutions of 1848 did not have wrong impact on work made in Berndorf instead of Essen, there was no break of work in Austria. As a result of responses in Essen, Therese Krupp sold the factory for Alfred, who retired from the factory in Berndorf. At the same time Hermann refused the part what he would have received from the factory in Essen. Though Alfred and Hermann had very different characteristics as siblings, they always had good relationship inside the family. He participated at World Expo hold in 1876 in Philadelphia, and visited several companies in the US. He wanted to gather new ideas and experiences regarding the production of nickel and silver. At the end of long travellings, his health damaged, handed over his company to his son, Arthur. Her died at the age of 65. Sources * Hans Jaeger: Krupp, Hermann.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. The house is now part of the campus of the Yeshiva K'tana. Description and history The Benedict-Miller House is located in a residential area three blocks north of Waterbury's downtown Main Street area, on the north side of Hillside Avenue at its junction with First Avenue. It occupies a large grassy parcel, and is set well back from the road, with a fine view over the downtown and industrial areas of the city. The house is a three-story wood frame structure, with asymmetrical massing and plan typical of the Queen Anne style. Its exterior is clad in a variety of finishes, including brick on the lower levels, wooden paneling, and varying styles of cut wooden shingles on the upper levels. A variety of porches and gabled dormers add rich variety to the exterior, most retaining the turned posts and balustrades characteristic of the period. The interior of the house is also replete with high quality original period finishes. With The house was completed in 1880 for Charles Benedict, a leading industrialist in Waterbury's dominant brass works. It was designed by Charles and George Palliser, and exhibits many elements found in the pattern books they published. It is one of only two grand houses to survive that were built for the city's 19th-century industrial leaders. The house was the second to be built for Benedict, who acquired the land in 1869 and originally had an Italianate estate house built. Benedict died in 1881, apparently before the family finished moving in. It was sold by his daughter in 1889 to Charles Miller, a local dry goods merchant. The city purchased the surviving elements of the subdivided estate in 1952, and it served for a time as part of the Waterbury campus of the University of Connecticut.

He was born 10 November 1914 in the Gro√ü Borstel district of Hamburg and died in Stockholm on 23 December 2008. Marcus‚Äô father was a German lawyer named Paul Marcus but his mother, Hilda Maria Dahl, was Swedish. The couple had four children: Ingolf, Gert, Holger and Anna Britta. Paul was of Jewish descent so, with the rise of Nazism, the family had to flee Germany. Ingolf, who was at that time a young pianist, had already moved to Zurich, where he later began a career as a conductor and composer. In 1939, he moved to Los Angeles and took his mother's maiden name, Dahl. Gert Marcus and his brother Holger moved to Sweden in 1933; other family members joined them there. The Sequence of Di-eder, in Lindholmen in G√∂teborg (Hans Wretling) Apart from a few months studying at the Otte Sk√∂lds m√•larskola (1936‚Äì37) and some months at the Ateneum School in Helsinki, Finland (1937‚Äì1938), Gert Marcus was an autodidact. He became one of Sweden's most consistent concretists, even if he distanced himself from all \\"isms\\". Marcus lived most of his life in Stockholm but he worked for long periods in France in Menton, L‚ÄôEsconil (Brittany) and Paris, and in Italy at Massa-Carrara. Early in his life he was influenced by Paul C√©zannes attempts in determining how to create space and volume without the use of Renaissance perspective. This led to Marcus‚Äô creating a color theory ‚Äì which he was faithful to during his entire artistic career. Work on volume and color opened for him a road to bas-reliefs and eventually to sculpture. In 1955 he met the artists Michel Seuphor, Nicolas Sch√∂ffer, and Georges Vantongerloo in Paris. With the last, Marcus developed a long and profitable friendship. In the 1950s, Gert Marcus was awarded several commissions, including that for a wall mosaic in Sankt Mikaels kapell in Mora in 1954, another mosaic in Stockholm's polishus in 1957, a choir wall in the church of Vant√∂r in Stockholm, and a wall mosaic in finely crushed glass in Sergelteatern in 1959. Marcus was frequently commissioned to provide sculptural monuments in public spaces in Sweden and even to design the interior of the Bagarmossen metro station in Stockholm. In 1999 Gert Marcus was awarded the Prince Eugen medal by the King of Sweden for \\"outstanding artistic achievement.\\" Body and Line, in Lund (Gert Marcus) Marcus married twice, first to Anne-Marie S√∂derlund, a marriage that lasted from 1945 to 1970 and produced two children, Anna and Claude and then, in 1977, to fellow sculptor Fran√ßoise Ribeyrolles-Marcus, with whom he fathered a second daughter, Aurelia. The \\"Initiative Marcus und Dahl\\" In 2017 residents of Gro√ü Borstel founded a new society, \\"Initiative Marcus und Dahl\\", with the goal of reviving interest in the work of Gert Marcus and Ingolf Dahl as well as other artists living or working, or having lived or worked, in Gross-Borstel. In 2018 a new street near the pre-World War II family home was named \\"Gert Marcus Strasse\\".

June 30, 1862 ‚Äì March 28, 1955) was a society leader in Denver, Colorado in the 19th century. She was the wife of Crawford Hill and daughter-in-law of senator and mining executive Nathaniel P. Hill. She created the first list of socialites in Denver, called the Who's Who in Denver Society, now called the Blue Book. She entertained with lavish parties and card games for an elite group called the Sacred 36. Early years Crawford Hill Louise Sneed was born in Townsville, North Carolina at about the start of the American Civil War. Her parents were William Morgan Sneed and Louise (Bethell) Sneed. Her mother died July 11, 1862, 11 days after giving birth to Louise. The Sneeds had a total of six children, two males were serving in the American Civil War at the time of her death. She was educated in New York City at St. Mary's School on 46th Street. It was an Episcopal boarding and day school offering primary, preparatory, and collegiate education for young ladies. It also provided preparation for foreign travel. Her father died December 10, 1891 near Townsville. After both of her parents had died, she went to live with an older sister in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1893, she came to Denver to visit cousins at Bethell mansion on Capitol Hill, where she met Crawford Hill, the son of Senator Nathaniel P. Hill. Marriage and children Crawford and Louise were married in Memphis in 1895. Sensing that her daughter-in-law was making a power play, Alice Hale Hill said that she was \\"sick over Crawford's marriage\\". Louise Sneed Hill with sons, Crawford Jr. and Nathaniel in 1905. Western History Department, Denver Public Library The Hills moved into an apartment at La Veta Place in downtown Denver, on the present site of the City and County building. They had two sons there, Nathaniel and Crawford, Jr. Denver society Hill began her quest to remedy what she saw as a \\"social wasteland\\" and to become a member of Denver society, following and surpassing the footsteps of her mother-in-law. The Hills built Crawford Hill Mansion at Tenth and Sherman Streets in 1905. Hill invited who she considered to be the best of Denver's high society to play whist or bridge. The group was made up of an elite group of 36 women for 9 tables of four people. This group became known as the Sacred 36. Margaret Brown wanted to be part of the group, but never was invited because of her improper grammar and boisterous demeanor. She labeled Hill \\"the snobbiest woman in Denver\\". Later, when Brown became a national figure as The Unsinkable Molly Brown, following the RMS Titanic disaster, she was then let into the Hill mansion. Hill entertained in style, wearing haute-couture clothing, with the best people of Denver, the international set, and royalty. She used the best caterers and the best orchestras. Seeking publicity, she courted the journalists and sent gifts to those that wrote about her parties. Crawford Hill Mansion, Tenth and Sherman Streets, Denver, Colorado She created the first published record of members of society in 1908 with the Who's Who in Denver Society. To be included on the list, one must have money and know how to entertain. It has evolved to the Blue Book of wealthy people from Denver. She provided information, such as the proper hours for calling, rules for the calling card, the high tea, the wedding journey, and how to get into society. Hill traveled to New York City; Newport, Rhode Island;, and Paris. While in England, she was presented at the court of King Edward VII. She wore a satin gown embroidered with diamonds and had a red velvet cape trimmed in 14-karat gold. She became the first person in Denver to entertain a president when William Howard Taft visited. He was met by a red carpet, an orchestra, and Hill's sons wearing white satin suits. She was politically active, involved in Republican women's clubs. Her sons married and moved to Newport, where she visited them. She continued to travel to Paris, London, and New York City. Bulkeley Wells Buckeley Wells. Photo from History of Colorado, edited by Wilbur Fiske Stone (1918). She met Bulkeley Wells, a polo-playing socialite, around 1914. He was a general in the Colorado National Guard and had mining interests in the state. They became involved in a love affair, which Crawford seemed to tolerate. The three of them often dined together and at times traveled together. Louise hung pictures of both men in the foyer of the mansion, Wells having the larger of the two pictures. The younger Wells was married with four children. His wife, Grace Livermore Wells, divorced him in 1918. As a result of the divorce, Wells lost $15 million in mining interests and the financing he received from his wife's family. Crawford Hill died in 1922, and Hill assumed that Wells would marry her, but he eloped with a woman from Nevada. Determined to \\"break him\\", she persuaded his remaining financial backer, Harry Payne Whitney, to withdraw his support. He lost his mining empire and gas and oil speculations. He gambled and lost the last of his money. He was on the verge of bankruptcy when he committed suicide in 1931. Later years She lived in the mansion until World War II when it was difficult to get domestic servants. She sold it in 1942 and moved into a suite in the Brown Palace Hotel. She led a quiet life until her death on May 28, 1955. She is buried at Fairmount Cemetery next to Crawford in the Hill family plot. After her death, there was no longer an interest in the flashing entertaining performed by Hill, nor the concept of society as Hill saw it. Local historian Caroline Bancroft said \\"There is no Society in Denver anymore\\".

Anteriorly the sutures are margined by a strong ridge, which is itself marked by extremely fine spiral lines. The whorls are marked by numerous fine spiral lines, which traverse the axial ribs as well as the other parts of the whorl. The spiral lines are finer and more numerous in the posterior part of the whorl, and are coarsest where they cross the axials.

This was followed by a translation titled The Yellow Sofa, by John Vetch and published by Carcanet Press in 1993. The latest translation, by Margaret Jull Costa, was published by Dedalus Books in 2012, together with six short stories by the same author. Alves & Co. is a comic novella on the theme of infidelity and its consequences. Background The story was found by E√ßa's son, Jos√© Maria, together with other writing, in a locked trunk. After deciphering his father's \\"vertiginous‚Äù script\\", Jos√© Maria addressed what he perceived as stylistic imperfections by editing the text on almost every page, removing semi-colons and dashes, changing the syntax and grammatical structure and adding adjectives. The novella was eventually released in 1925. Plot Alves & Co. concerns Godfredo Alves. He had a successful import-export business in Lisbon in the last decades of the 19th century, in partnership with his friend Machado. Godofredo admires Machado's success with women and makes no complaint when he absents himself from the office to further these relationships. One day he arrives at the office to find Machado absent again. Thinking of Machado's successful romances, he then remembers that it is his own wedding anniversary and, after buying a present for his wife, Ludovina, returns home early, only to find Machado in an embrace with her on the yellow sofa of his house. Machado runs away. With the help of a financial incentive, Godofredo persuades his father- in-law to take back his wife. He also feels the need to regain his honour through challenging Machado to a duel. The story is really about his half- hearted efforts to achieve this; the contrast between the feeling that he must stand up for his honour and that of not wanting to get hurt or killed, despite his suggestion to Machado of a suicide pact. Eventually his friends, originally approached to be seconds, arrange a compromise that avoids a duel. In time he gets back together with his wife and, once again, becomes friends with Machado. Reviews and other observations Adultery, more precisely female adultery, is a recurrent theme in Eca's work. The novella has been described as a \\"nice, small portrait of Portuguese bourgeois life ... a fine little story, but a satire of the gentlest sort\\". The humour comes through the ways the characters each try to smooth things over by turning a blind eye to the truth. \\"It is an amusing tale of a weak-willed but sympathetic man trying to make the best of a situation that's beyond his capacity.\\" As Conall Cash puts it, the novella explores \\"ways in which Alves' bourgeois consciousness reacts to this catastrophe, and how his romantic, chivalrous side battles with and inevitably loses out to the respectable, conservative pose of the businessman\\". Cash sees the work as an allegory for Portuguese society of the time. Cash also highlights the role of Portuguese colonialism in this story and many others by E√ßa; in Alves & Co., Godofredo runs a trading house dealing with the colonies. Opera adaptation An opera based on Alves & Co., The Yellow Sofa by Julian Philips with a libretto by Edward Kemp, conducted by Leo McFall and directed by Frederic Wake-Walker was performed for the first time at Glyndebourne opera house in the United Kingdom in 2009. The Yellow Sofa was then revived for the Glyndebourne tour in 2012, and performed across the UK. In 2020, the opera is scheduled to receive its Hungarian premiere directed by Andr√°s Alm√°si-T√≥th.

From September 1968 the Yaa-nnn series commenced (in blue on reflective white) at YAB. YAA was set aside for recalls of numericals, but public pressure led to a backflip and the authorities allowed motorists to retain their existing numbers as long as they converted them into blue on reflective white, for a fee. ACT plates were the first of any region in Australia to be reflective, this commenced at YAA-nnn. Canberra ‚Äì The Nation's Capital Canberra ‚Äì Heart of the Nation. This licence slogan is optional on most cars that are in Canberra. It is now withdrawn from sale By November 1979, It changed with the new slogan added to \\"ACT- Canberra The National Capital\\" starting at YMA-000 as the previous block stopped at YJZ-999. In 1983, following the change of Federal Government, blocks of YKA to YKK's in the previous style were allocated to the public as it was found in storage. To celebrate the Bicentennial celebrations in 1988, new vehicle registrations received plates from YRS-000 to YSP-999 that had a black outline of the new Parliament House in the middle, flanked by 1788 on the left and 1988 on the right. As these special plates become evermore rarer, they are sought after and particularly valuable. Remakes have been done in current embossing style. In early 1996, as YZZ-999 was reached, it went back to YKL to continue filling the unused allocation in the ACT- Canberra The National Capital slogan, and filled unused YAQ, YBQ, YCQ, YDQ, YEQ, YFQ, YGQ, YHQ, YIQ, YJQ, before ending as YLZ-999.

The previous Feel the Power Slogan was replaced by the original \\"ACT ‚Äì Canberra The Nation's Capital\\" and an optional slogan was offered \\"ACT ‚Äì Canberra Heart of the Nation\\". In 1999, manufacturer changes lead to the adoption of NSW Premium embossed dies on ACT plates and continues today. This started from 'YAT-00A'. Since 2007 a special series bearing the slogan \\"ACT-Celebration of a Century 2013\\" is being issued in commemoration of Canberra's centenary year in 2013. These plates were issued starting with YGA-00A, then at end of YGZ-99Z it skipped over to YIA-00A. Since 8 July 2015, a new slogan has been offered ‚Äì CANBERRA ‚Äì AN AGE FRIENDLY CITY as an additional option to the existing slogans. The ranges YKQ-00A to YKQ-99Z and YLP-00A to YLP-99Z have been allocated for this new slogan. Canberra - The Nation's Capital series has also been updated as the alpha numerics has been embossed closer rather than the wider and the ink colour changed to a slightly darker blue tone.

The hotel is located at the Barcelona's main avenue, Avenida Diagonal. History In the early 70's the mayor of Barcelona was Josep Maria de Porcioles, a clever politician who took full advantage of the construction fever of developmentalism. During his long term (1957 - 1973) he undertook urban projects destined to transform Barcelona into a city that could host a new Universal Exhibition like the one that in 1929 had radically changed the city. Porcioles believed that for his projects, the city needed more luxury hotels, so he granted a license to the Hilton hotel chain to build a large and modern skyscraper in the heart of the Diagonal. The problem was that the concession was illegal, since it exceeded by 40% the limits indicated by the law for volumetric and building heights. The courts ordered Hilton to demolish the excess of the building that was illegal, which meant cutting half a skyscraper and compensating the city with a millionaire amount. The Hilton didn‚Äôt do it, and the litigation lasted years, until the Democracy (1980), when an agreement was reached that saved the building. A private company bought the building and converted it for sanitary uses, the courts accepted the exchange and the Hilton became the Barcelona Hospital. Instead of suites, they had to put in operating rooms, the luxurious halls were replaced by waiting rooms, waiters replaced by nurses and guests by patients. A few years later, Hilton managed, legally to build another hotel, located just across the road, where the current Hospital was planned. ‚ÄúHilton hotel becomes a hospital‚ÄùHospital de Barcelona Building Nowadays the hotel has 290 rooms, including 14 suites, it is 45.00m in height and includes 14 floors above ground and 5 more below.Hilton Barcelona on Emporis Hilton Barcelona has been renovated in 2012 and the designer of the renovation in the lobby was the Italian architect and designer Matteo Thun.Hotel Hilton, Barcelona ‚Äì Redesign References Category:Hotels in Barcelona Category:Hilton Hotels & Resorts hotels ","title":"Hilton Barcelona"},{"id":"57813122","text":"Changing Stations is a classical-contemporary concept album by British composer Daniel Liam Glyn, released on 28 October 2016 via Caravan Boy Records. The album's first single, \\"Monday\\", was released to digital music retailers on 16 September 2016 and the track itself was performed on RTTV's current affairs programme, Going Underground.  Background and release  Shortly after graduating from The University of Salford, Glyn relocated to London and began seeking inspiration for a collection of new piano pieces to coincide with his neurological condition, Synaesthesia. Glyn soon began to study the London Underground tube map and felt a connection between his Synaesthesia and each of the tube lines colours, and decided to study them in more detail to gain a better understanding of each line and their contrasting atmospheres and type of commuter. Work on the compositions began in late 2012 and concluded in 2014. The eleven tracks featured on the album are based on each of the London Underground's main tube lines: Bakerloo, Central, Circle, District, Hammersmith and City, Jubilee, Metropolitan, Northern, Piccadilly, Victoria, and Waterloo and City, and are composed in the keys of G minor, A major, C major, F# minor, E major, B major, Ab major, D major, D minor, Bb major and D minor respectively. Each track focuses heavily on the different speeds, sounds, and mood of each line, and are composed in the key signature synaesthetically assigned by Glyn with reference to the colour of the tube line on the map. The thoughts, opinions and descriptions of the London Underground can be heard throughout the record by commuters of the network, along with stories of different events in the city. The recording of the album took place between 2014 and 2015 in both Manchester and London through the use of computers and mobile phones, paying homage to the revolution in technology on the London Underground since its inception. Elements of prepared piano can be heard on several tracks on the record, replicating and imitating the sounds of the train carriages and train tracks in movement. Items such as credit cards, oyster cards, paper money, coins, and tube maps, (all of which are frequently used to travel on the London Underground), were strategically placed between the strings of piano to produce an array of different rhythmic and percussive sounds, drawing inspiration from composers such as John Cage and Maurice Delage who also used this technique. \\"Melancholy\\", the ninth track on the album, is based on the 7th July 2005 terrorist attack on the network's Piccadilly Line, and features a narration by one of the survivors of the attacks. The final track on the album, \\"The Drain\\", takes its name from the colloquial term for the Waterloo and City line. The album was successfully funded through Kickstarter in April 2016 and subsequently released worldwide on 28 October 2016. In May 2017, every piece from the album was remixed by electronic music producer Damion O'Brien, turning the original compositions into a new collection of Electronica, Ambient House, Nu-disco, and Drum & Bass themed tracks. The project 'Changing Stations: Derailed' was described by Annabelle Carvell of Synaesthesia Magazine as \\"injecting a new lease of life into the original classical piano compositions, with the tracklisting re- arranged to form a new 'journey' on the London Underground\\"  Critical reception  Barry Adamson from Piccadilly Records described the album as \\"a beautiful, and conceptually superb suite of plaintive modern-classical utterances and spoken word narration. Somewhere between the grand, filmic post-rock of This Will Destroy You and the soundtrack work of Adam Wiltzie and Max Richter.\\" Aliya Ismangil of The Mancunion stated the compositions have \\"a feel of constant frantic energy from the minor pulsing chords under eerie synth sounds, reflecting the haphazard contrasts of the different stations on a line\\".Changing Stations' music album tells story of synaesthesia The MancUnion, 13 March 2017 Sam Liddicott from Music Musings & Such defined the album as \\"unique and highly illuminating music\\".

Sirlin studied from 1948 to 1952 at the University of Buenos Aires, where he received his doctorate in 1953 under the supervision of Richard Gans. In 1953‚Äì1954 Sirlin was a fellow at the Centro Brasileiro de Pesquisas F√≠sicas in Rio de Janeiro, where he took several graduate course, including one taught by Richard Feynman. Sirlin was in 1954‚Äì1955 at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and in 1955‚Äì1957 at the Cornell University, where in 1958 he received a doctorate under the supervision of T≈çichir≈ç Kinoshita. (Sirlin's Argentine doctorate was not accepted in the academic system of the USA.) From 1957 to 1959 he was a research assistant at Columbia University. At New York University he was from 1959 to 1961 an assistant professor, from 1961 to 1968 an associate professor, and from 1968 a full professor, retiring in 2008. Sirlin did research in the 1950s on radiative corrections in the theory of muon decay, i.e. higher-order corrections in the allowed weak interactions of quantum electrodynamics (QED). In 1960 Sirlin and Ralph E. Behrends discovered the nonrenormalization theorem for partially conserved vector currents in the SU(2) theory of weak interactions and suggested the theorem's generalization to higher symmetry. Their theorem plays an important role in experimentally verifying predictions from the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. Beginning in the 1970s Sirlin did research with his student William J. Marciano on higher- order corrections in leptonic decays. With Tsung-Dao Lee und Richard M. Friedberg, Sirlin did research on non-topological soliton solutions in quantum field theory. Sirlin was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1971. He was in the academic year 1983‚Äì1984 a Guggenheim Fellow and in 1997 received the Alexander von Humboldt Award. In 2002 Sirlin and William J. Marciano received the Sakurai Prize for their collaborative research on the theory of electroweak interactions. Selected publications * with M. A. B.

As a Romanian national monument, its code is CV-II- m-A-13297. \\"B√°lv√°nyos\\" in Hungarian means \\"idolatrous\\", so the name of the fortress can be loosely translated into \\"the Castle with/of the Idols\\".  Location  B√°lv√°nyos castle can be found on the top of a steep hill, to the northwest of where the Torjai and Bodoki mountains meet.  Etymology  The castle received its name from the fact that it was one of the last holdouts of the original pagan Hungarian faith. The castle's lords, the Apor family, refused to convert to Christianity, long after the conversion of most of the rest of the country. According to traditional tales, the Apors became Christians in the early 12th century. According to a legend, the lord's son, Apor Szilam√©r, wanted to marry Mike Imola, then the only child of the rival Mike family. The Mikes were already Christians at the time, making a marriage impossible. Apor Szilam√©r decided to kidnap the girl, provoking the anger of the Mike family, who prepared to lay siege to the castle. Imola proved to love Szilam√©r back, and persuaded him to convert to Christianity - making peace and a marriage between the family possible without bloodshed. This legend became the basis for J√≥kai M√≥r's novel titled B√°lv√°nyosv√°r.  History  According to folklore, tribal chieftain Opour (Apor) built the castle during the rule of king Stephen I, in order to be able to continue practicing his pagan faith in peace. Written sources mention the castle from the 12th century onward, first under the name Baluanus, and later, in 1360, as Castrum Balwanus. The castle had an ovoid-shaped wall, and on its northern end a quadrangular tower with cisterns below it. The castle was fortified with both an outer and an inner wall. According to local folklore, this was the location where Otto of Bavaria, crowned King of Hungary, lost his crown to K√°n (Apor) L√°szl√≥ in 1307. During the chaotic period after the extinction of House √Årp√°d, Otto went to Transylvania to visit K√°n L√°szl√≥, allegedly to ask for the lord's daughter's hand. K√°n L√°szl√≥ let the king in, but imprisoned him, also taking the Holy Crown of Hungary. This paved to way for the Angevin dynasty's coming to power in Hungary. The crown was later given to the first Angevin king, Charles Robert, but only after Papal pressure, and three years late for Charles Robert's coronation. The castle was inhabited by the Apor family all the way up to the 17th century, until Apor L√°szl√≥ fell in the Battle for Brass√≥ (Brasov) in 1603. After this, the family moved into a more comfortable manor in Torja. Soon after, the castle started decaying.

The chant has been performed by fans of a number of clubs, but came to prominence during the UEFA Euro 2016, when fans of Iceland national team introduced their 'viking clap' or 'volcano clap' with a 'huh' chant. During 2018 FIFA World Cup where Iceland was one of the participating teams, the clap once again drew attention. The Viking Thunder Clap has been adopted by fans of many countries worldwide.  Origin  The chant may have been inspired by the film 300 released in 2006. Some believed the chant was first used by fans of Scottish club Motherwell F.C., while others suggest it had been performed by fans of the French club Lens more than two decades prior. Fans of the Greek side PAOK have also chanted \\"PAOK\\" on the clap of hands since the mid 1990s.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=looVzTVn8Tk The version by Motherwell fans was passed on to the Icelandic fans when Motherwell faced Icelandic team Stjarnan in a Europa League game in 2014, and Icelandic fans then used it for the Iceland national team. During the UEFA Euro 2016, Iceland performed unexpectedly well and reached the quarter-finals, and the performance of the chant by their fans drew the attention of other European fans, who then also performed the chant. It has since been adopted by fans in many countries worldwide. Other teams India national team celebrating their win with the fans choreographing the viking claps during 2019 AFC Asian Cup.

He was the first civilian to hold a visiting professorship of military history at West Point, and was a professor of military history at the United States Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. He was the founder of the modern military staff ride, and was a two-time recipient of the Outstanding Civilian Service Medal of the Department of the Army. Family and education Jay Luvaas was the son of Morten Jay Luvaas (1896‚Äì1973) and Agnes Olson (1900‚Äì1982), both children of Norwegian immigrants. He was born on 15 June 1927 in Erie, PennsylvaniaObituary of Jay Luuvas, _Daily Press_ (Williamsburg), 14 January 2009. and grew up in Meadville, where his father, a graduate of St. Olaf College,Registration State: Minnesota; Registration County: Rice; Roll: 1675779. taught music at Allegheny College, and composed choral music.Year: 1940; Census Place: Meadville, Crawford, Pennsylvania; Roll: m-t0627-03475; Page: 14B; Enumeration District: 20‚Äì22B.

Career Jay Luvaas in 1954, at the Duke University manuscript collection, with curator Mattie Russell. Luvaas' The Civil War: A Soldier's View (1958) collected the writings of Colonel George Francis Robert Henderson, a British observer of the American Civil War. Henderson's international reputation had been built on a biography of Stonewall Jackson; Luvaas' study combined Henderson's work as a military historian/biographer and a teacher of the art of war, recognizing that Henderson's fame rested on his career as a teacher and writer, not as a field officer. In the final chapter, as J. Orin Oliphant points out, Luvaas analyzed Henderson's contribution to military thinking and education.J. Orin Oliphant, Review. _Pennsylvania History: A Journal of Mid-Atlantic Studies_ , Reviewed Work: The Civil War: A Soldier's View. A Collection of Civil War Writings by Colonel G. F. R. Henderson by Jay Luvaas, Vol. 25, No. 3 (July, 1958), pp. 339-341. In 1959, the University of Chicago Press published Luvaas' dissertation on the lessons learned by British, French and Prussian military observers of the Civil War, The Military Legacy of the Civil War: The European Inheritance; this was republished in 1988 by University of Kansas. In this study, he examined the American Civil War through a foreign soldier's eyes, and found the view very different from those presented by American soldiers. Luvaas offered a careful account of the conclusions of the European military observers, particularly the Prussian, British and French. These observers eventually helped to shape tactics of World War I and World War II, but not, as previously believed, the Second Schleswig War between Prussia and Denmark or the Franco-Prussian War.Trumbull Higgins (reviewer), Reviewed Work: The Education of an Army: British Military Thought, 1815-1940 by J.

Boone Bartholomees, Buff Facings and Gilt Buttons: Staff and Headquarters Operations in the Army of Northern Virginia, 1861‚Äì1865, University of South Carolina Press, 1998, , p. vii. He visited the battlefields of the American Civil War annually, either on War College Staff Rides or with regular tours. Beginning in 1962, Luvaas led groups of amateur and student historians to various Virginia and Pennsylvania battlefields; the group, nicknamed the Army of Cussewago, after Cussewago Creek near Meadville, included over time Luvaas' friends, interested historians, students from Allegheny, and cadets from West Point.Donald Delbert France, Speak, Memory: Time Regained. Tromps. Accessed 7 July 2018. Luvaas' and Nelson's volume the U.S. Army War College Guide to the Battle of Gettysburg (1986) is a feature in Civil War battlefield tours.Edward K. Eckert, St. Bonaventure Cadets Visit Gettysburg, _Army History_ , No. 13 (Fall 1989), pp. 11‚Äì12. With his friend Brigadier General Harold W. Nelson, Luvaas authored several volumes of the US Army War College Staff Ride Series on the Civil War: Gettysburg, Antietam, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, and co-authored another on the Battle of Shiloh and the Atlanta campaign. Luvaas also the translated military writings of Napoleon and Frederick the Great, and edited volumes of the writings by George Henderson, and a book on the history of military theory in Britain in the 19th and 20th centuries. Luvaas argued that the primary value of the subject of history to a military officer is not merely a factual background, but also a grasp of trends and the meaning of ideas. History should not be subjected to the idea that it repeats itself, an unreasonable process that forces historical evidence into convenient patterns. Rather, the study of history, military history in particular, helps to illustrate points of leadership and doctrine.Jay Luvaas, Military History and Officer Education: Some Personal Reflections, _The Army Historian_ , No. 6 (Winter 1985), pp. 9-11. In his 1985 essay on officer education, Luvaas maintained that the best people to teach officers were civilian historians, although others promoted a modified view, that a faculty of civilian military historians should be tempered with professional soldiers.David G. Gruenbaum (Maj.), \\"Military History and Officer Education: Who Should Teach, and What? \\" _The Army Historian_ , No. 9 (Fall 1985), pp. 11‚Äì13. The combined spirit if the professional soldier and the civilian historian, Benjamin Franklin Cooling suggests, is a new school of military history that unifies old and new historical styles: it modifies the patriotic gore described by Edmund Wilson with contextual and integrative studies of leadership and theory. There is room for both the \\"informed and broader contextual study of military history as suggested by Professor Jay Luvaas, ... and [for] his more popular resurrected \\"historical rides\\" to Civil War battlefields.\\"Benjamin Franklin Cooling, Toward a More Usable Past; A Modest Plea for a Newer Typology of Military History, _Military Affairs,_ Vol. 52, No. 1 (Jan., 1988), DOI: 10.2307/1988377 pp. 29‚Äì31. Assessment Luvaas was one of a generation of historians to examine the Anglo-American tradition in military history. Trumbull Higgins described Luvaas' work in Education of An Army: British Military Thought 1815-1940 (1964), as a careful and detailed study of the development in military thought from Wellington to World War I, and a much needed analysis that flowed logically from Luvaas' earlier work on the Civil War.Trumbull Higgins (reviewer), Reviewed Work: The Education of an Army: British Military Thought, 1815-1940 by J. Luvaas, _The American Historical Review_ , Vol. 71, No. 1 (Oct., 1965), DOI: 10.2307/1863126 p. 185. In his 1999 review of Military Legacy of the Civil War (1959), Owen Connelly maintained that Luvaas had never written or edited a bad book and that he \\"demolished the widely accepted idea that U.S. Civil War had demonstrated the nature of modern war to Europeans, especially the Prussians,\\" lessons that they employed successfully against Denmark and France immediately. Instead, Connelly maintained, Luvaas argued that the Prussians had all but ignored their Civil War observations until after 1914, as did the other powers. According to Connelly, Luvaas' work in Napoleon on the Art of War argued that Napoleon \\"created\\" the operational level of war, a category between strategy and tactics. Furthermore, Napoleon made the corps his standard unit, and it was adopted by all the major armies in turn, making operational art possible.Owen Connelly, _The Journal of Military History_ , Reviewed Work: Napoleon on the Art of War by Jay Luvaas Vol. 63, No. 4 (Oct., 1999), DOI: 10.2307/120576 pp. 977‚Äì978.

The same year, motorcycles and trailers plates were modified to accommodate registration labels to be displayed in a box below the T letter for trailers and at the right hand side for motorcycles. It happened for a while before the change of manufacturer. In the 1990s MVR started offering custom, or combination of alpha numerics personalised in Ochre-white base, Black-white base and black-yellow base, with slogan options N.T. - OUTBACK AUSTRALIA or N.T. - NATURE TERRITORY - or N.T. at the top. In 1998, Vehicle general series reverted to the Australian standard embossing used before 1987. Trailer plates used the Tnn-nnn format up it was exhausted in 1998 after which Ta-nnnn was implemented. This was previously on a black on yellow base until 1979 when the current ochre on white slogan plates were introduced. In the early 2000s slimline plates were introduced on personalised /custom or general series via remakes only. By August 2008 it was reported both motorcycles and general series have reached the 9's and a new system was being looked into to replace the current system. It was reported that the MVR in the NT is looking at n-a-nnnn or aa-nnnn or the NSW aa-nn-aa format to replace it. It is expected to occur near the end of 2010. As of 23 October 2009, the NT Government announced the chosen new plate format Ca-nn-aa. It will also replace the all numeric motorcycle series with alpha numeric series. The new series was unveiled in January 2011. It became available for issue in June 2011, with the same ochre on reflective white base and slogan slightly modified to show as NT OUTBACK AUSTRALIA without dash and full stops. Motorcycles From 1953, Motorcycles had the NT insert embossed at the left hand side while the remainder is embossed as 12-345 in white on black base. From 1979, the ochre on reflective white base was introduced, with the slogan NT-OUTBACK AUSTRALIA for a brief period at the top before reverting to N.T. Motorcycles since March 2011, have the new format adopted as A-1234 replacing the numerics issued since it began, is the 1st version. in 2013, with the labels abolished, motorcycles plates had the box rego label space removed and alpha numeric characters realigned to the middle, hence version 2 of the current format began but it lasted for about 2,500 before changing again. As of October 2015, motorcycles have changed the embossing back into the standard Australian motorcycle starting from A-8900's, hence the 3rd version since the March 2011 changeover. Special purpose plates Government Special purpose plates offered are MO (Buses), MB (Mini Buses), Private Hire PH, Taxi, SUB taxi series, TV (Tourist Vehicle), SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle), LV (Limousine Vehicle), CV (Courtesy Vehicle), D - Dealer Trade series and SFV (Special Function Vehicle) Dealer Trade series was in annual cyclic colours before changing to the yellow on black reflective base then finally into current ochre on reflective white base. MO bus plates from 1953 until 1987 was in yellow on black base which was later reflective in the 1980s and was replaced by the current blue on mid yellow base. Initially it used wheat base but changed to mid yellow base. Lorry plates in small L embossing and in black on white was introduced in 1953 but lasted only 3 years and was recalled & replaced by the standard general series. in the 2010s, a new club plate scheme has replaced the VCC (Vintage Car Club) scheme, with embossed legend CLUB down left vertical and bottom legend \\"NT-MOTOR ENTHUSIAST\\" and is white on reflective red.

The union was established in 1831 by a wide variety of local societies, in support of a strike at Gotts Woollen Mill in Leeds. The most important society was the Leeds Clothiers Union, and its leader, Simeon Pollard, became the Yorkshire Trades Union's secretary. The various societies comprising the union each had their own initiation ceremonies, and they required members to take a vow of secrecy. Initially, the union grew quickly, having 20,000 members by October 1832, including some in other counties. However, the majority of members worked in making textiles from wool or worsted, and it was in these trades that it repeatedly took industrial action against employers who tried to force workers to sign agreements not to join a union. The union collapsed in 1834, although many of its constituent societies remained active.

The party achieved its first state party in New York with ballot access. The party has stated that they intend to surpass the elections vote limit or use petitions to gain access in other states, in order to contest future elections. The party contested its first election in the New York gubernatorial election of 2018 with candidate Stephanie Miner, former chairperson of the New York Democratic Party and former mayor of Syracuse.  Foundation and history  The party's founders previously worked as staffers for George W. Bush, including CEO Sarah Lenti, who served under Condoleezza Rice as a Director on the National Security Council, and Reed Galen, who worked on three presidential campaigns and is chief strategist of the party. On June 18, 2018, Stephanie Miner, a member of the Democratic Party, announced she would run for the 2018 New York gubernatorial election and announced she would run under the party. Miner subsequently picked former Republican Mayor of Pelham, Michael Volpe as her running mate. The party chair, Scott Muller, stated that he intends to register the party in New York before expanding to create a national party. Miner was required to achieve 50,000 votes in the election, or use petitions, to gain permanent ballot access for the next four years. SAM announced in 2018 that they would work with the newly created, Kansas-based Party of the Center to gather the 18,000 petition signatures necessary to certify the party on Kansas ballots. On August 21, 2018, SAM achieved ballot access for their first electoral race in the New York Gubernatorial election in 2018. The party gained 40,000 signatures, which far exceeded the 15,000 required, and the petitions were subsequently deemed valid. This enabled them to form a SAM party within the state of New York to contest any future elections they choose to enter. On November 11, 2018, SAM became a ballot-access qualified party in New York state after Miner got 50,672 votes on the party line. On January 14, 2020, SAM filed a lawsuit against a new law enacted in New York which would remove ballot access from parties if they do not receive 130,000 votes or 2% of the presidential popular vote, whichever is greater. As of February 2020, there are 349 registered members of SAM in New York. Ideology The party generally takes a centrist or center-right approach, as it is founded by former George W. Bush administration staff members. As a result of the ideological foundations of the party, it aims to attract both moderate Republicans and centrist Democrats. Party platform The party follows a set of general principles rather than an objective ideology of policies, in order to pursue a common outcome without divisive political differences. The party's priorities include: * Addressing income inequality * Innovating health care * Improving the education system * Remaining fiscally responsible * Promoting diversity * Embracing free markets * Providing simple and fair tax * Supporting liberal democracy domestically and internationally * Undertaking criminal justice reform * Pursue electoral reform (Including repealing Sore- loser laws) * Rejecting isolationism Electoral history Gubernatorial nominees {  + ! colspan=\\"8\\" Serve America Movement Gubernatorial Tickets - New York - Year State Nominee Running Mate Vote Count Percentage Place Notes - 2018 New York Stephanie Miner Michael Volpe 51,367 .89 5th  } Voter registration New York: {  - !

He served as a member of the Prussian regional parliament (\\"Provinziallandtag\\") between 1924 and 1933. In 1938 he was arrested in Moscow where he had lived for some years. He was executed in 1939.  Life  Leopold Flieg was born into a working-class family in Berlin. Half a century later it would have become important for the authorities that the family was identified as Jewish, with the result that his mother and sister, along with a number of relatives, would be murdered in Nazi concentration camps. On leaving school Flieg undertook a commercial apprenticeship at a bank, and he worked as a bank official till the outbreak of the war. In 1908, aged fifteen, he joined the Young Socialists. Three years later, still aged only eighteen, he joined the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD) itself. 1911 was also the year in which he became a member of the \\"Zentralverband der Handlungsgehilfen\\" (loosely: \\"National Clerical Workers' Union\\"). There are indications that he was already on the fringes of the social circle centred on the political pioneers, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht. During the First World War Flieg was conscripted into the army, but he was wounded early on and spent the war years in Berlin where he was employed as a \\"soldier-clerk\\" in the \\"secret department\\" of the General Staff. During the war years Flieg was involved actively with the anti-war Spartacus League, and he was one of the founders of one of the Free Socialist Youth (\\"Freie sozialistische Jugend\\") organisations of the time. In 1918, working as secretary for Leo Jogiches, a close friend of Rosa Luxemburg he increasingly became an \\"insider\\" with the leadership of what would soon become the German Communist Party. Flieg was always noted for his discretion and retiscent demeanour, however. His manner was famously measured and he never raised his voice. During 1918 he began a lifelong friendship with Willi M√ºnzenberg, but the extent of his influence in extremist left-wing circles during the crucial final months of 1918 remains unclear. The founding congress of the Communist Party of Germany took place in Berlin over three days between 30 December 1918 and 1 January 1919. The core of the founding membership consisted of those who had hitherto been Spartacus League members: Leo Flieg was a party member and part of the leadership team from the outset. He worked closely with Willi M√ºnzenberg on the creation of the Young Communist International (\\"Kommunistische Jugendinternationale\\" / KJI), serving as a member of its executive committee from its launch in 1919 till March 1922. During the immediate postwar years Flieg was lodging in Berlin with the family of a girl friend. The father of the family, who worked at the giant Osram factory in Berlin, was heard to marvel at the abstemious ways of his daughter's seemingly unassuming friend: \\"I was amazed that Leo managed a whole egg for breakfast: half that amount would most certainly have been enough for him!\\" (\\"Mich wundert es eigentlich, das Leo zum Fr√ºhst√ºck ein ganzes Ei schafft, ein halbes w√ºrde ihm sicher auch gen√ºgen!\\"). From 1922, jointly with K√§the Pohl, Flieg served as secretary to the Organisation Office (\\"Orgb√ºro\\") of the party politburo. He participated in every congress conducted by the Communist Party of Germany between 1920 and 1932. In 1924 he stood successfully for election to the Prussian regional parliament (\\"Provinziallandtag\\") as a Communist Party member. Successively re-elected at subsequent elections, he retained his seat without a break till 1932. He was elected to the party Central Committee in 1927 and appears to have joined the politburo shortly afterwards. At the sixth world congress, in 1928, he joined the Comintern International Control Commission. One source indicates that from 1928 Flieg made his home in the Comintern's so-called \\"Hotel Lux\\" in Moscow, though the extent of his activities in Germany suggests that at this point much of his time was still spent in Berlin. Leo Flieg liked to operate behind the scenes, which can make it hard to pin down details of his work for the German Communist Party. According to one source, records uncovered in Moscow during 1992/93 show that during the early 1930s, as a secretary of the party and commissioner of the Comintern Intelligence Service (\\"–û—Ç–¥–µ–ª –º–µ–∂–¥—É–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π —Å–≤—è–∑–∏, \\" / OMS), Leo Flieg was in charge of spending an annual subsidy from Moscow valued at 1.8 million marks, co-ordinating false passports, radio operators and couriers. He himself headed up a counterfeiting operation with 170 \\"employees\\". This intelligence role was conducted in close collaboration with the Soviet secret police. The Soviet Communist Party became increasingly polarised during the later 1920s between those who were supportive of Stalin and those who dared to be thought to speculate that perhaps Lenin's successor should have been Leon Trotsky. The Soviet party and the German Party were closely linked at various levels: party ruptures in Moscow found powerful echoes among the comrades in Berlin, with a major programme of expulsions during 1928 and the establishment by many of those expelled of an alternative party. Sources insist that through this period Leo Flieg carried out his party functions with skill, loyalty and meticulous care, without regard to whether the party leadership might be considered too far to the left or too far to the right. Then, in May 1932 Flieg was relieved by the German Party of his party responsibilities, seen as having become too close to Heinz Neumann, a close political comrade and a personal friend. In 1930/31 Neumann had become critical of the party leader Ernst Th√§lmann, and thereby also of Stalin, both of whom, he said, were underestimating the dangers presented by the rise of the Nazi Party. In April 1932 Neumann was stripped of his party functions and summoned to Moscow. Flieg was identified as a \\"member of the Neumann group\\" and his demotions, accompanied by the inevitable mutterings about Trotskyite sympathies, followed a few weeks later. His membership of the politburo was reduced to \\"candidate membership\\". Despite his disgrace in Germany, Flieg still had influential friend in Moscow as a result of his years as linkman for the Berlin activities of the OMS. He knew Piatnitsky and Abramov-Mirov and other Comintern leaders from long years of working together on \\"intelligence matters\\". By the end of 1932 he was working in Moscow for the Comintern executive committee. Sources are not entirely consistent over his postings over the next few years. In January 1933 the Nazis took power in Germany and Communist Party activists were either arrested (or worse) or escaped abroad. Moscow and Paris both quickly became informal headquarter locations for the German Communist Party in exile. Flieg was sent to Paris and was able to renew his important hands-on political work as a \\"technical secretary to the politburo\\". By 1934 he was evidently rehabilitated by the Germany party, and there is mention of his having been sent by the politburo Central Committee not just to Paris, but also to Saarbr√ºcken during the run-up to the 1935 referendum, and to Prague. In October 1935 the exiled German Communist Party held its first party conference since the Nazi take-over in Berlin. The Brussels Conference was also the last conference that the party would be able to hold for more than ten years. Flieg participated, identified pseudonymously as \\"Alfons\\", and presented the party's finance report. He was re-elected to the party Central Committee. After that he was probably based in Paris till 1937. During 1937 Leo Flieg was deprived of his German nationality and so became stateless. At Easter that year he received an invitation from the Comintern to a meeting in Moscow. Those with contacts in the Soviet Union were by this time fully aware of the rising level of political arrests under way in what later came to be known in English language sources as the Great Purge. Flieg knew the risks inherent in returning to Moscow and friends urged him to stay in Paris. The Swedish banker Olof Aschberg urged him not to go, and promised support in seeking \\"emigrant status\\" from the French authorities. But Flieg felt constrained to accept the invitation. He had responsibilities for party monies, and feared he might be accused of embezzlement by Comintern chiefs in Moscow if he did not comply with their order. Flieg returned to Moscow in June 1937 and installed himself once more in the \\"Hotel Lux\\". His meeting with Comintern management took place, but he received only a reprimand. Early in 1938 the German representative among the Comintern leadership, Philipp Dengel, lodged an application for Flieg to be permitted to leave the country again. Authorisation never came through. Instead, on 20 March 1938, Leo Flieg was arrested by the NKVD and charge with \\"membership of a right-wing Trotskyite spying organisation\\". According to a television report of research undertaken by the Hamburg historian, Reinhard M√ºller, Leo Flieg was tortured for an entire year (\\"Flieg wurde ein ganzes Jahr lang gefoltert ....\\"). In the course that lengthy succession of torture sessions he was persuaded to incriminate himself and many others. In the written \\"confession\\" extracted from him he confirmed his membership of a Comintern anti-Soviet conspiracy. On 14 March 1939 Leo Flieg was condemned to death by a military tribunal of the High Court and executed by shooting. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1957. Personal paranoia at the top of the Soviet government which underpinned the Great purge can be seen as a sufficient explanation for Flieg's conviction. He was only one of many hundred Comintern workers and collaborators who fell victim to it. Documents from the Soviet Union that became available after 1990 disclosed a hitherto unsuspected level of involvement by leading members of the German community of exiled communists in Moscow. In the words of one headline that appeared in 1990, \\"more than a thousand German communists fell victim to the Stalin Terror, with the approval of leading comrades in the Communist Party of Germany\\". Subsequent investigation of contemporary documents suggests to some that the involvement of the leading German communist comrades probably extended beyond mere approval. In 2002 work undertaken on more recently studied Soviet documents led one specialist historian to point the finger at Herbert Wehner (identified in Soviet records of the time under the party name \\"Kurt Funk\\"). Wehner returned from Soviet exile in 1946 and rose to become a leading figure in West Germany's Social Democratic Party. Under NKVD interrogation in the Lubyanka Building during 1937 Wehner found himself accused of joint responsibility for the arrest, in Germany, of the German party leader, Ernst Th√§lmann, back in 1933. The accusation might have been expected to have ended in Wehner's death, but it did not. Wehner chose to co-operate. He wrote for his interrogators a lengthy report entitled \\"Report of investigation into deeply ingrained Trotzkyite activity in the German anti-fascist movement\\" (\\"Untersuchungsbericht zur trotzkistischen W√ºhlarbeit in der deutschen antifaschistischen Bewegung\\"). The report included the names of all the communist German political exiles in Moscow who shortly afterwards fell under suspicion of being \\"Trotskyites\\" and / or members of \\"counter-revolutionary groups\\". Wehner's report on Flieg included the observation that he had been characterised by party leader Ernst Th√§lmann as a rogue (\\" Er sei, so Wehner, vom Vorsitzenden Ernst Th√§lmann als Gauner bezeichnet worden\\"). Soon after Wehner submitted his report hundreds of German communist party refugees were detained by the Soviet authorities. For Reinhard M√ºller this was part of a desperate \\"survival straegy\\", which for a terrified Herbert Wehner worked in its own terms, but for which hundreds of others paid the price. An alternative interpretation might be that the German political exiles caught up in the Stalin purges would have been arrested anyway, and Wehner's active collusion merely facilitated the exercise.

It consists of seven cover songs and was released on August 24, 2018. Background After extensive gaps in album releases by the band between their last studio albums, six years between Out of the Vein (2003) and Ursa Major (2009), followed by another six years until Dopamine (2015), Third Eye Blind frontman Stephan Jenkins announced the band would be moving away from full-album releases in favor of more frequent, smaller EP releases moving forward. Jenkins made good on the promise, just a year later releasing the seven-track EP We Are Drugs. The band's next plans included releasing a 2017 EP called Summer Gods, to coincide with a tour of the same name, and would have explored a variety of new sounds for the band, including trap music. However, the EP was not finished in time to be released during the tour, and was instead changed into simply a live album of performances from the tour. In June 2018, it was announced that the next EP was instead to be titled Thanks for Everything, and to consist of seven cover versions of various songs of Jenkins' selection. The change in plans was attributed to, and inspired by, the band's trips to local museums and galleries during the Summer Gods touring, and the proceeds from the EP go towards the Andy Warhol Museum. Jenkins stated that the act of reinterpreting and recording cover songs of various genres that had influenced the band over the years was done to help find inspiration for the creation of a future studio album. Composition and themes The EP consists of the band's reinterpretations of seven vastly different musical artists: Happy Diving's \\"10\\", Babyshambles's \\"Fuck Forever\\", Santigold's \\"This Isn't Our Parade\\", Tim Buckley's \\"Song to the Siren\\", Chastity Belt's \\"Joke\\", Queens of the Stone Age's \\"In the Fade\\", and Bon Iver's \\"Blood Bank\\". \\"Blood Bank\\" is a song the band had previously been performing at live concerts as early as 2012. Consequence of Sound described their version of \\"Fuck Forever\\" as \\"less consciously sloppy than [Babyshamble's frontman Pete] Doherty's original cut\\" but still having \\"an anthemic, cathartic feel that's no doubt born from his views on the US's current political climate.\\" Release and promotion The EP was first announced on June 22, 2018, alongside the release of the first single, \\"Fuck Forever\\".

When the Taa-nnn issues were exhausted, motorcycles were issued with high end YYA-000 to YZZ-999,then started at YKA-000 to YKA-799, and trailers issued YAA-000 to YIL-999. Since 2008, newly issued plates are in the form S000-AAA and motorcycles as S00-AAA, while trailers start at S000-TAA.  EzyPlates  EzyPlates is administrated by the Department of Transport Infrastructure and Energy SA. * Premium Plates Since 1995, \\"Premium\\" registration plates can be purchased which are much more compact in size, in the format aa-nnna: the letter is usually repeated (e.g.: AA-nnna, BB-nnna, current series DD-nnna). These seem to follow the New South Wales Premium format, using black lettering on a white background on a noticeably slimmer plate. South Australian \\"Premium\\" registration plates feature black characters on a white base, and the letters \\"SA\\" down the side, in the same format as NSW \\"Premium\\" registration plates. As of 28 September 2009, there is a new addition to the premium range ‚Äì white on black base, from XX-000A onwards. * Personalised plates: Introduced in 1979, in green on yellow original format with South Australia legend at the top. It started as aa-nnnn, aaa-nnn and aaaa-nn. Available for general vehicles, trailers and motorcycles in 1996, the range was revamped, to the premium style dies and later with more recent dies, and has additional colour range on top of the original green on reflective yellow. * Custom Plates: Introduced in the 1990s and revised to the current range of colours. Can order up to 7 characters and is also available for trailers and motorcycles. *Japanese JDM: The Department of Planning, Transportation and Infrastructure SA is proposing a JDM plate in black, red, green and magenta colours on reflective white with SOUTH AUSTRALIA embossed at the bottom and Japanese inscription at the top. It will come in set series and custom options. Yet to be released as is currently seeking feedback via their Facebook page before they can be released.  Special purpose plates  Government and police vehicles has SA Government plates in blue text on white background as S000¬∑AQA (or previously XQA-000), with a Q as the second letter signifying \\"Queen\\" or representative of the government. Older systems were allocated SAA-000 to SZZ-999 to government services as well. The legend is embossed as SA Government. Ambulances belonging to SA Ambulance Service have plates in the form AMB-nnn, however some vehicles now have standard SA Government plates due to leasing agreements with the State Government (Fleet SA). Metropolitan taxis have plates with the word TAXI in a smaller size followed by three or four numbers, separated by the current tourism logo for South Australia ‚Äì SA, A Brilliant Blend. More recently a new country taxi plate has been introduced in black on reflective yellow replacing general issue plates on SA country taxis. Other chauffeured vehicles have a different style plate with a blue outline. Since September 2007, The heavy vehicle series commenced and the format used is SB¬∑00¬∑AB with the legend SA ‚Äì HEAVY VEHICLE,the Trailers start at SY¬∑00¬∑AA  General issue  No general issue SA registration plates (other than Government) are issued with the letter Q anywhere in the combination. The only exception is the series VPQ-nnn and WSQ- nnn ‚Äì both of which were the first set issued by a new manufacturer. Between 1981 and October 2008, all general issue SA plates contained the slogan \\"SA ‚Äì The Festival State\\", for the Adelaide Festival of Arts. Between 1997 and October 2008, other slogans were available for an additional fee, including: South Australia ‚Äì Gateway to the Outback; South Australia ‚Äì The Defence State; South Australia ‚Äì The Wine State; South Australia ‚Äì the Creative State; South Australia ‚Äì The Rose State; and South Australia ‚Äì The Electronics State. All slogan plates are discontinued, as at October 2008.

After the Catalan government declared an illegal Catalan declaration of independence and consequently the Spanish Senate imposed direct rule over Catalonia, Millo continued to have an important role. Several Catalan town councils in the hands of radical independentist movements approved motions declaring him persona non grata, such as Montblanc, Vic or Girona.Vic declara persona 'non grata' Enric Millo i exigeix la retirada dels cossos policials i militars de l'Estat Girona declara Felip VI i Millo persones no grates i s'oposa a l'aplicaci√≥ del 155 His term ended on 19 June 2018,Real Decreto 427/2018, de 18 de junio, por el que se dispone el cese de don Josep Enric Millo i Rocher como Delegado del Gobierno en la Comunidad Aut√≥noma de Catalu√±a. when he was replaced by Teresa Cunillera,Real Decreto 455/2018, de 18 de junio, por el que se nombra Delegada del Gobierno en la Comunidad Aut√≥noma de Catalu√±a a do√±a Teresa Cunillera i Mestres. after Mariano Rajoy's Government was ousted following the no confidence vote against Rajoy at the motion of censure on 2 June 2018.

Like other Australian plates, these are usually particular to a vehicle, changing hands with it, and are generally permanent (yearly registration is required, however). Victorian registration plates are manufactured at Hopkins Correctional Centre in Ararat, Victoria. Initial Victorian plates, issued from 1910 to 1939, were in numerals only, from 1 to 285-000. From 1930, \\"Vic\\" inserts were added vertically down the left-hand side of the plate. In 1939, Victoria switched to a two-letter, three-number scheme (AA-000 to ZZ-999) of which also bear \\"Vic\\" down the left-hand side. This format was later used for motorcycles. In 1972, the two-letter, three-number scheme was reintroduced as an optional, personalised plate style for cars. These had an embossed \\"Vic\\" above the plate's embossed characters in full length. Victoria (1953‚Äì1977) From January 1953, owing to the Federal number plate system, Victorian plates switched to the three-letter, three-number standard: GAA-000 to HZZ-999, and JAA-000 to LZZ-999, coloured white lettering on a black background, and a \\"Vic\\" insert on the top of the plate. The first three-lettered plate, GAA-000 was issued on 27 January 1953. The letters \\"I\\" and \\"Q\\" were not issued in any combinations, due to these being easily mistaken for \\"1\\" and \\"O\\" or \\"0\\". For the same reason, In 1964, Victoria skipped the I-prefix series and went straight from HZZ-999 to JAA-000. However, having reached the end of their Federal allotment of letters, Victoria in 1974 commenced from LZZ-999 to IAA-000 (in some later plate sequences, the capital I had noticeable staves to tell them apart from the number 1. The earlier sequences did not, due to the I-series plates being made by two different manufacturers, who used different dies for the \\"I\\"). This was only a temporary measure, naturally, as Victoria faced the same problem having proceeded through the I-series three years later. Victoria ‚Äì Garden State (1977‚Äì1994) Having exhausted the I-series plates, in November 1977, reflective green-on-white plates were introduced, beginning at AAA-000 and running to FZZ-999, and then skipping to a brief run of RAA-000 to RBZ-999 in 1994, bearing the slogan Victoria ‚Äì Garden State at the bottom of the plate initiated by the then premier Rupert Hamer. In the early 1990s, it was discovered that the reflective properties of many registration plates in the range from AAA-000 to EZZ-999, and the principally the C-series, were defective and this had coincided with the rapid introduction of traffic enforcement cameras in Victoria. Due to the number of plates which were unidentifiable in photographs, all defective plates were recalled and new plates issued free of charge. This caused the rapid consumption of the plate stocks especially late in the F-series and some plates (those were starting with FVA-000 to FVZ-999 and FYA-000 to FYZ-999) were produced in Queensland to meet demand. These plates are identifiable by their different embossed dies and vertical diamond separator (as opposed to Victoria's horizontal diamond). It is a popular myth that the defective paint was caused by prisoners manufacturing the plates urinating in the paint mixture. To commemorate the 150th anniversary of European settlement in Victoria, plates from late 1984 to 1985 bore the slogan Victoria ‚Äì 150 Years across the bottom. These plates were issued for the CBK-000 to CDZ-999 range and were the same green colour. In 1985, some of the CGI-000 to CGQ-999 or CGZ-999 series plates bore the slogan Vic ‚Äì Nuclear Free State across the bottom, also in green initiated by John Cain the premier at the time. For the Australian Bicentenary in 1988, plates in the DJE-000 to DRZ-999 range bore the \\"Vic\\" insert horizontally down the left-hand side and the slogan Australia 1788 ‚Äì 1988 in green across the bottom. In 1992, the EWA-000 to EYF-999 plates were produced with the slogan Victoria ‚Äì Drive Safely across the bottom in green. Victoria ‚Äì On the Move (1994‚Äì2000) In September 1994, in an initiative by the then Liberal Premier, Jeff Kennett, reflective blue-on-white plates were introduced, beginning at NAA-000 and ending at QDQ-999. The diamond-dot in the middle was changed to the state logo of a blue St Edward's Crown over an upside-down blue triangle with the Victorian Southern Cross in white inside. These plates bore the slogan Victoria ‚Äì On the Move across the bottom. In 1996, shorter slimline plates which bear the \\"Vic\\" insert vertically down the left-hand-side, and use a different font were issued. These are usually the same width as regular plates and were offered as remakes of existing plates in either blue or green on white, all with the Victoria ‚Äì On the Move slogan. Unlike slimline or premium plates used in other states, Victorian premium plates follow the same numbering as standard plates, meaning a slimline plate can be matched with a full-sized equivalent. After the Labor Party headed by Steve Bracks was elected at the September 1999 state election, the Premier by press release on 4 January 2000 announced a public campaign to choose a new slogan that ended on 21 January. This was done because of the affiliation of the old design and slogan to previous government. The old state logo and motto were phased out in February 2000 to prepare for the introduction of a new one. Until the new design was finalised, interim plates in the QDR-000 to QNF-999 series reverted to the old diamond-dot with just Victoria stated across the bottom (for the regular size) and \\"Vic\\" vertically printed on the left-hand side for the slimline design. Victoria ‚Äì The Place to Be (2000‚Äì2013) On 18 May 2000, Bracks announced the winning slogan to be Victoria ‚Äì The Place to Be, as nominated by three contestants. This was controversial as it was later learned that the government had paid an advertising firm associated with the Labor Party to assist with the slogan and updated plate design despite it being presented as a public competition. The first plates were issued on 17 October 2000 to the three winning entrants. Starting with QNG-000, these plates dispensed the diamond-dot separator for the new state logo‚Äîan enlarged blue triangle containing the Victorian Southern Cross‚Äîthe top of which merging with the upper border of the plate. The slimline version retained the previous interim design, which remains the current style. Vic ‚Äì Stay Alert Stay Alive (2013‚Äì2015) In December 2010, the new Ted Baillieu Liberal government announced its intent to drop The Place to Be slogan from the regular sized plates. On 10 June 2013, the Victorian government announced that the current series was exhausted with the final plate ZZZ-999 is already purchased.  Current general series  For information regarding skipped combinations please refer to Skipped Combinations section * Vehicles: 1RR-1AA * Trailers: B00-000 * Motorcycles: 2J-1AA The new series utilises the format naa-naa starting from 1AA-1AA and was launched on 19 August 2013 using the slogan Vic ‚Äì Stay Alert Stay Alive. The new format is estimated to last for 50 years. During the transitional period, Z-series stocks will still be available for motorists who lose or damage their plates, while the new series will be for general everyday issue. This combination with four separate sequences (one number, two letters, one number, two letters) is one of the most complex structure adopted for a vehicle registration plate around the world. It has also been suggested that the \\"1\\" at the front of the combination followed by two letters might be confused with \\"I\\", for example, making 1CE look like ICE. Another issue with the new series is that the letter \\"O\\" and the number \\"0\\" are the same shape in the font used on Victorian plates, so the combination ending in \\"4OW\\" for example, is more likely to be read as \\"40W\\". This mistake was less likely to be made on the older series as the letters and numbers were isolated by a separator. Slimline black registration plate (2013‚Äìpresent) Plates in the AAA-000 to BZZ-999 range that have been cancelled/expired, have been reissued to the public and dealers on a limited scale since June 2013. These plates are only available with white stamped slimline dies letters on a black slimline base. Particular combinations cannot be pre-ordered; buyers receive the next combination in stock over the counter. As at the end of April 2020, this numbering scheme has reached the BHA-000 combination. Victoria ‚Äì The Education State (2015‚Äì2016) Victoria ‚Äì The Education State (2016‚Äìpresent) As part of Labor's campaign for the November 2014 state election, the Daniel Andrews-led party announced its intention if winning office to replace the Vic ‚Äì Stay Alert Stay Alive with the slogan Victoria ‚Äì The Education State. After winning this election, the Andrews government honoured this pledge, with the new plates released on 16 October 2015, starting at 1GA-1AA. Unlike previous combinations, the \\"1G\\" combination was only produced in standard dimensions with the Victoria ‚Äì The Education State slogan. Slimline plates continued under the \\"1F\\" series. In circa February 2016, the slimline plates progressed to the \\"1I\\" series, skipping \\"1H\\" which was allocated to the standard size plates from circa March 2016. Once VicRoads exhausted the \\"1H\\" combinations in early August 2016, the standard size plates recommenced from \\"1IE\\" onwards (with 1IA to 1ID used for slim plates). Starting 1 September 2016, plates bearing the new Victorian state logo replaced the previous Southern Cross design starting at combination 1IL-1AA. The Victorian government had earlier unveiled this logo on 12 August 2015.

The 100 to 285-000 range is reserved for the exclusive, handmade \\"Heritage\\" series plates. Three (100-999), four (1000-9999) and five-digit (10000-99999) combinations can only be purchased via public auction. There are a number of custom plate options in Victoria, issued by V Plates on behalf of VicRoads. Custom or personalised plates come with the optional purchase of a contract. This contract allows the plate holder to retain the plates whether on a vehicle or not. Holding a contract on certain plates, means that when the plates are no longer registered they cannot be resold/issued to another person unless the contract holder sells the contract. VicRoads (who own V Plates) do not know the cumulative figure of the total number of custom registration plates sold since they were first launched in 1986. This is because many personalised plates are not on vehicles, or they are held on self-retention, or have been handed back to VicRoads. However, VicRoads do know that around 30,000 sets of custom registration plates are made every year, and they estimate 10 percent of registered vehicles have custom registration plates. Sometimes car importers or dealerships reserve a range of plates to put on their cars, the contracts for which are often sold on to customers with the purchase of a car. For example, Subaru bought STI-000 to STI-999 and WRX-000 to WRX-999 for their Subaru Impreza WRX and STI models. Victorian Euro plate There are two types of plates, (standard and mini) designed specifically to look like European registration plates, called Euro plates. The standard Euro plates, introduced in 2005 are wide and high and the mini ones are wide and high. Euro plates have a blue section to the left containing \\"Vic\\" vertically above a Victorian Southern Cross, and in the main section contain the letter \\"V\\", a full- coloured Victorian coat of arms, and two letters, a space and three numbers (V aa-nnn). These plates use the FE-Schrift font and look like German plates. The general series range from VAA-000 to VZZ-999 are reserved for Euro plates. As of 1 January 2019, the crest has been updated to show a more Australian look with the adaption of the possum on a crest. It replaced the official Victorian government crest. In 2006, to commemorate the 2006 Commonwealth Games being held in Melbourne, VicRoads offered a limited edition of 1,000 series of plates in the format M06-nnn. These had the slogan Melbourne 2006 and featured a red-tailed black cockatoo (the official mascot of the 2006 Commonwealth Games). The proceeds were donated to the Department of Sustainability to raise funds to preserve this bird. All official vehicles actually used in the Commonwealth Games were supplied by Toyota Australia and used general issue XAA-nnn plates. The following year, VicRoads issued a similar limited edition Penny the Penguin series in the format M07-nnn, to commemorate the 2007 FINA Swimming World Cup. In 2008, AFL Premiership plates were released. The Hawthorn Football Club won the premiership in that year and hence the registration plate format was HH-08-aa (HH for Hawthorn Hawks, and 08 designating the year they won the premiership). The customer was able to choose the last two characters. The plate was brown on reflective white and featured a watermark of the club's logo in the centre of the plate. Recently some prestige plates have been issued, which consist of four numbers or two groups of three numbers. Plates using the format B-nnnnn has been released for vehicles registered in Bendigo (B-0001 to B-4999) and Ballarat (B-5001 to B-9999). These have a customised insert of their town, and are usually blue lettering on a reflective yellow background; slogans vary. Since 1993, those also registered to horse studs across Victoria can reserve a V-nnnn series, usually brown lettering on a yellow background and stating Victorian Thoroughbred as a slogan. Others are designed after football teams, and a limited edition Grand Prix series (GP-001 to GP-999) was authorised when Melbourne first hosted the Australian Grand Prix in 1996. Slimline editions of these plates have also been produced. In July 2014, the old general issue Garden State and On the Move slogans have been reintroduced as a \\"Retro\\" option. The plates come in green for \\"Victoria ‚Äì Garden State\\" starting from AAA-000 to FZZ-999, plus RAA-000 to RBZ-999, and Victoria ‚Äì On the Move in blue on reflective white bases starting from NAA-000 to QDZ-999. These are produced in screen-printed slogans (rather than embossed when they were originally issued) and all features are only an approximation of the original dies.  Other vehicles  * Trucks and other heavy vehicles: are also given standard issued plates (i.e. the same as cars). Until 1987, trucks had the interstate black on white series from IS-0000 to IU-6999 and was replaced by the now obsolete Federal Interstate Registration Scheme. * Buses, coaches and commercially owned or run mini-buses: bear plates using a four-number, two- letter (nnnn-aa) format. Between 2001 and 2013, these suffixes were AO, AC, SO or NC, depending under which registration they fall under (accredited operator, accredited charter, school operator and non-commercial). Special issue registration plates of \\"Accredited Bus Service\\" may only be issued to buses operated by persons who have been granted bus operator accreditation by the Director Bus Safety, Transport Safety Victoria (TSV) to operate bus services. As of December 2013, the AO series ran out at 9999-AO and as a result a replacement series was launched BS12-AB in white on green \\"Accredited Bus Service\\" at the top the \\"Vic\\" embossed vertically on the right and the number/alpha sequence in white stamped slimline dies, with the Southern Cross in yellow as the separator as Victorian taxis. AC, SO and NC plates can continue to be displayed until the bus retires from service and these suffixes will not be allowed to be reallocated to another bus. Hence, AO or BS plates are the only current bus series authorised by the Transport Safety Victoria's Safety Director. Previously, the style usually bear the usual state logo, with \\"Accredited Bus\\" across the top and the Victoria ‚Äì The Place to Be across the bottom. Until 2000, buses used whatever plate was available in the general issue series. Some bus operators requested general issue registration plates with numbers that matched the fleet numbers of the buses they operated. In 2001 the entire Victorian bus fleet had their old general issue plates removed and replaced with the new accreditation plates, with some operators being allocated blocks of plates to match bus fleet numbers. Some fleets re-use plates when a bus in the fleet is replaced. On some occasions AO, AC, SO and NC plates were made in a plain Victoria in regular dies and can be described as an error manufactured plates, but allowed to be put on buses. It is noted that some AO suffixes received remakes under the current state slogan Vic ‚Äì Stay Alert Stay Alive. Operators whose buses possess personalised plates have until 31 December 2015 to re-register to the accredited BSR bus plate scheme or when a bus will be accredited as part of TSV's bus accreditation transitional program.

Number and letter combo is in slimline sizing on a standard issue plate size to fit added text. * Tow trucks: used TOW-nnn for the first 1,000 registrations from 1981‚Äì1996 using the green Garden State plates. When the 1,001st tow truck was registered in 1996, the format swapped to the blue On the Move plates using nnnn-TT, the TT standing for \\"tow truck\\". This allowed for another 10,000 to be registered. In 2000, the interim style was adopted as per the general issue plates. With the release of The Place to Be plates, tow trucks now use general issue plates. :* Tow trucks: TOW-000 to TOW-999 :* Tow trucks: 0000-TT to 9999-TT :* Heavy tow trucks: 000-HTT to 999-HTT. A batch of plates was produced in error with the letters reading HHT (rather than HTT) and the On the Move slogan; these were unused and sold to collectors. Motorcycle * Motorcycles: have smaller plates compared to cars and trucks. The colouring and format of motorcycle plates has changed with the standard car- issued plates, except for the emblem inserts or other symbols that may take more space to represent. They used white-on-black plates until 1978, after which moving to green-on-white; blue-on-white has been used since 1994 or 1995.

The bike rack plates has been updated as of December 2013 with screen printed bottom legend Vic ‚Äì Stay Alert Stay Alive and Bike Rack legend at top and the ink was changed from black to blue. The slogan was later replaced with the current slogan Victoria ‚Äì The Education State. * Taxis: had plates with a design similar to the Garden State plates, with the numbers and legend being green and a diamond as separator (except with the legend saying Victoria ‚Äì Taxicab). They were redesigned in November 2008 with a green background, the legend Accredited Taxi Service at the top the Vic embossed vertically on the right and the number/alpha sequence in white stamped slimline dies, with the Southern Cross in yellow as the separator. In Victoria, taxis have the following plates: ** M-nnnn: metropolitan taxis (Melbourne), issued in the series M 0000 to M 9999 (except for M 5000 to M 5099 which are issued for taxis with wheel-chair licences only) ** nnnn-M: metropolitan taxis (Melbourne), issued in the series 0000 M to 9999 M as the website published on 26 October 2017 shows as referred tohttp://taxi.vic.gov.au/owners-and- operators/taxi-owners-and-operators/vehicles/taxi-licence-plates ** U-nnnn: urban taxis (Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong), issued in the series U 0000 to U 9999 (except for U 5000 to U 5099 which are issued for taxis with wheel-chair licences only). ** C-nnnn: country taxis (areas other than Melbourne, Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong), issued in the series C 0000 to C 9999 (except for C 5000 ‚Äì C 5099 which are issued for taxis with wheel-chair licences only). ** R-nnnn: regional taxi plates? ** nnnn-PS: peak service taxis, issued to taxis that can only operate during 3 pm and 7 am daily and 24 hours during the Australian Grand Prix, Melbourne Cup Day and Crown Oaks Day. Peak service plates are issued in the series 0000 PS to 9999 PS. ** ST-nnnn: substitute taxis, issued in the series ST 0000 to ST 9999 to spare vehicles which replace licensed taxis when they are off the road for repairs. First commenced in 1970. * Motor hire cars: were originally issued with the plates VHA-000 to VHA-999, with VHA standing for \\"Vehicle Hire Australia\\". Hire cars continued with VHB after the first 1,000 were issued, and then moved onto the VHC series. The company is no longer VHA, but VHA Corporate Cabs. This company runs a luxury car hire service. A large number of black Holden Caprice and similar limousines are seen with VH combinations, particularly in and around the Melbourne's CBD. Motor hire cycles have plates issued in the S-000 to S-999 range. The VHA and VHB Hire car plates are expected to be discontinued in Victoria during 2018, which confirms VHA or VHB plates are now no longer required to be registered but remain valid for pre-existing issues. Any VHA to VHC plates does not have to be in standard blue style as owners can restyle into mostly white on black colours. As of November 2019, VHD-000 to VHZ-999 range has been made available to any vehicle with the new plates bearing as \\"Commercial Passenger Vehicle\\" printed at the bottom of the plate and in blue/white colours. Victorian Government plates * Consular Corps: CC-000 to CC-999. These plates used to appear identical to regular standard issue plates, except Victoria ‚Äì Garden State or Victoria ‚Äì On the Move was replaced with Vic ‚Äì Consular Corps. In 2000, they were redesigned‚Äîthe plate has the same dimensions as regular plates, but has the rego number in the font used for slimline plates. The legend \\"Consular Corps\\" appears at the top, while the legend \\"Victoria\\" appears at the bottom. As of 20 February 2016, the design was replaced with navy blue background, reflective white with VIC embossed vertically at left hand side, reflective white bottom legend Consular Corps in screen print and Consular Corp Melbourne gold logo in the middle between CC and the three-digit number. Character embossed reverted to the full style used in the Garden State and On the Move era. * State government: including police cars, fire engines, and other state government cars usually use a combination in the Maa-nnn series of plates for registration. These plates exclusively use the Maa-nnn combinations and their design has always mirrored that of general issue plates. The government plate series started at MZA-000 to MZZ-999, MYA-000 to MYZ-999, MXA-000 to MXZ-999, MWA-000 to MWZ-999 and MVA-000 to MVU-999. The original state government plates were identical in design to the general issue equivalents. With the release of the Victoria ‚Äì Garden State plates in 1977, the green text on white background was replaced with red text on white for government applications. This colour scheme has remained ever since, even with the adoption of newer plate designs and slogans. In 1992, plates in the MVE-000 to MVU-999 series sported a Victoria ‚Äì Drive Safely slogan as per the general issue plates of this time. With the switch in 1994 to the slogan, Victoria ‚Äì On the Move, the plates started at MAA-000 having skipped from MVV-000 to MVZ-999. The design and slogan changed in 2000 to the Victoria ‚Äì The Place to Be type starting at MBE-000. Sometime between August 2013 and April 2015, the series continued from MCV-000 under the new slogan Vic ‚Äì Stay Alert Stay Alive. From circa March 2016, Government red plates began to be produced with the Education State slogan from MCZ-000 onwards. Due to a supplier change, emergency service vehicles temporarily reverted to general issue plates (blue on white) in late 2016. The new plates appear to have a lighter shade of red and the new series began at MDA-000. As of May 2019, the series was up to MDE-000. * Federal government: cars owned by the Australian Government but registered in Victoria use plates in the ZED-nnn series, with the letter Z being red. This is a carryover from the Federal Registration Scheme of the 1950s, when the Zaa-nnn series was allocated to the Australian Government. Trailers owned by the Federal Government use the combinations Znn-nnn. * Electric vehicle trial: between October 2010 and June 2014, the Victorian Government operated an electric vehicle trial with 54 vehicles as of December 2012. These trial vehicles featured special registration plates in the same design as the regular plates of the same vintage, but using the format nnn-EVT (e.g. 024-EVT) and the slogan Vic ‚Äì Electric Vehicle Trial. * Historic Vehicle: Originally issued as CH-nnnn and nnnnn-H and as of 22 December 2018 the new format series has commenced nnnn-Hn by simply shifting the H from the last place to the second last. White on Maroon base. * Rally Vehicle: nnnn-RP in white on navy blue base.  Discontinued plates  * Interstate trucks: IS¬∑nnnn Allocated from IS-0000 to IU-6999 as it was replaced by the current FIRS scheme in 1987. * T- and TC- series taxis: Melbourne: T¬∑nnnn Country: TC¬∑nnnn introduced in 1953 and was recalled when replaced by the current M, C, U, and PS series * P-series 28-day permit: P¬∑1 to P31¬∑999 This series started in 1930 and was only valid for 28 days. Five different styles were issued, starting with enamel, then the second style in vertical \\"Vic\\" with dot separator between alphanumerics. The third style has \\"Vic\\" across the top, and the fourth style changed to a diamond separator. The final style had the diamond separator moved to between the second and third numerals. The P-series plates was discontinued in the late 1980s as plates were not returned on expiry and was replaced with paper permits. * V- and MZx-series Government plates: V¬∑nnnn Introduced in the late 1930s starting with vertical \\"Vic\\", which was later relocated to the top of the plate. Replaced in 1963 with the previous style as shown MZZ¬∑nnn allocated from MZZ¬∑999 to MZA¬∑000.

(, STAL) in Finsp√•ng, √ñsterg√∂tland, Sweden (1910s). STAL (Svenska Turbinfabriks AB Ljungstr√∂m; \\"Swedish Turbine Manufacturing Co.\\") was an industrial company established in 1913 in Finsp√•ng, Sweden, by the brothers Birger Ljungstr√∂m, and Fredrik Ljungstr√∂m, developing the Ljungstr√∂m turbine.https://web.archive.org/web/20160909132622/http://www.tekniskamuseet.se/elkraft/tillverkarna/stal.htm Svenska Turbinfabriks AB Ljungstr√∂m - Tekniska Museethttp://www2.finspong.se/1900/arbets/stalarb.htm STAL-arbetarnas historia In 1916, STAL became a subsidiary of ASEA. In 1959, the company was merged with AB de Laval Steam Turbine in Stockholm and formed Turbin AB de Laval Ljungstr√∂m, which changed its name to STAL-LAVAL Turbin AB in 1962. After ASEA merged with Brown Boveri to ABB 1988, the name was changed to ABB STAL AB. This company later joined forces with Alstom. Ever since, the business is split between Alstom (Alstom Power Sweden AB) and Siemens (Siemens Industrial Turbomachinery AB).  History  AB Ljungstr√∂ms √Öngturbin was formed in 1908 for the production of the Ljungstr√∂m turbine (later called STAL turbine) and other inventions of the two brothers Birger Ljungstr√∂m (1872-1948) and Fredrik Ljungstr√∂m (1875-1964). The first Ljungstr√∂m turbine was completed, and in 1912 the second copy was delivered to 7000 kW to England to supply London's trains with power. Manufacturing was originally placed at workshops at L√∂vholmen at Liljeholmen just outside central Stockholm. Svenska Turbinfabriks AB Ljungstr√∂m (STAL) was formed in 1913 to take over the manufacturing and sales right of Ljungstr√∂m turbine. The production moved simultaneously to Finsp√•ng. The operations expanded rapidly and steam turbines for both industrial and marine purposes were exported to, among others, Japan, South Africa and Poland. ASEA took over the majority of shares in STAL 1916, and in 1932, it delivered Northern Europe's largest power plant, a 50 MW STAL turbine, to the public V√§ster√•s steam power plant in V√§ster√•s. The same year was also saw the production of refrigeration from another of ASEA's subsidiaries, Luth & Ros√©ns Elektriska AB in Stockholm. During the 1940s, STAL began to develop gas turbines for jet engines. Among other things, the idea was to manufacture combat engines for the Swedish Air Force, but when they preferred British manufacturers, STAL instead focused on stationary industrial gas turbines. The result was the GT-35 model, which in further developed form is still sold, now under the name SGT-500. In 1959, the operations were merged with AB de Lavals √Öngturbin. The new company name STAL-LAVAL Turbin AB came a few years later and the business was concentrated in Finsp√•ng.

He is a professor of industrial relations and human resources in the department of political science at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. Early life and activism: Sojourner Truth Organization 1968-1972 Prior to his academic career, Goldfield was an activist and organizer, first with the Students for a Democratic Society and later with the Sojourner Truth Organization, where he was a founding member and a part of the organization's Westside branch. Goldfield was employed at the International Harvester plant in Melrose Park, IL where he sought to engage in workplace organizing as a part of the Sojourner Truth Organization's political work. At the International Harvester plant, Goldfield was involved in establishing a dissident caucus within the plant's union chapter organized by the United Auto Workers. Despite resolutions adopted by the Sojourner Truth Organization calling on membership to engage in more mass organizing, which entailed a further openness to engaging with industrial unions, the Organization as a whole remained critical to unions and a significant tendency within the Organization remained skeptical of membership involving themselves in trade union politics., As one of the Organization's most experienced workplace organizers, and a member whose rank-and-file coworkers encouraged him to run as a shop steward at the Harvester plant, Goldfield expressed enthusiasm in greater union involvement, a decision for which certain membership within the Organization criticized him. In 1973, Goldfield, who felt that this criticism led to his marginalization within the Organization, co-wrote a position paper endorsed by the Organization's Westside branch entitled \\"Crisis in the STO,\\" which issued criticisms of numerous aspects of Organization's positions, from class consciousness to its theoretical positions on party formation. After the release of the paper, Goldfield and his supporters eventually departed the Sojourner Truth Organization, resulting in the Organization's first split. Career Goldfield has contributed to scholarly discussions on the labor history of the United States, particularly to debates on the cause of union density decline, and its relationship to race and ethnicity in the United States. In his first book, The Decline of Organized Labor in the United States, Goldfield argues that the decline of American union density beginning in 1955 was the result of both changes in government policy that restricted workers' rights to unionize, including the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, and the growth of anti-union consulting agencies, which businesses employ to deter union organizing. Goldfield's contribution to the debate on union density decline has been recognized as significant in that it attributes the decline in union power not to American demographic and industrial shifts but instead to an increasing political hostility to unions in the United States. In Goldfield's second book, The Color of Politics: Race and the Mainsprings of American Politics, he argues that progressive and socialist politics in the United States have been stifled by racism. Further, Goldfield claims that the failure of American labor unions to confront racism and organize African-American workers contributed to the inability of labor unions to play a greater political role in American society. Francis Fox Piven referred to the book as a \\"magisterial review of the role of racism in American history\\". Goldfield has also participated in debates within political science on the origins of the New Deal. In response to Theda Skocpol's critiques of Neo-Marxist theories of the state, published in 1980 in the article \\"Neo-Marxist Theories of the State‚Äù as they apply to ‚Äúthe Case of the New Deal‚Äù\\" in Politics & Society, Goldfield issued a defense culminating in an exchange in American Political Science Review. Skocpol's defense of her critiques, and her subsequent assessment of Goldfield's arguments in what have become known as the Wagner Act Debates, are regarded as an important moment in the development of academic theories of the state.

The awareness effort is led by Prison Fellowship, the nation's largest nonprofit serving prisoners, former prisoners, and their families, and an advocate for justice reform. History and purpose In the United States, one in three American adults has a criminal record, which limits their access to education, jobs, housing, and other things necessary for a productive life. Even after their debt to society is paid, these men and women face more than 48,000 documented legal restrictions in addition to widespread social stigma. This is sometimes called the ‚Äúsecond prison.‚Äù Prison Fellowship founded Second Chance Month in 2017 to raise awareness and improve perceptions of people with a criminal record, encourage second-chance opportunities, and drive momentum for policy change throughout the country. The nonprofit designated April as Second Chance Month for several reasons, including the following: * The United States Department of Justice recognizes National Reentry Week. during April. * Prison Fellowship had previously held Second Chance 5K races in April. * The anniversary of the federal Second Chance Act is during April. * April marks the anniversary of the death of Charles Colson, who used his second chance following his incarceration for a Watergate-related crime to found Prison Fellowship. * The Easter season focuses on the message of Christ's atoning sacrifice and themes of redemption and second chances, although Second Chance Month is not a movement restricted to the faith community. 2017 Prison Fellowship declared Second Chance Month for the first time in April 2017. More than 77 organizations joined the nonpartisan effort as official second-chance partners (although partnership does not indicate support for particular legislation or policies). Throughout April, Prison Fellowship mobilized individuals, businesses, organizations, legislators, and other supporters to sign petitions, post to social media, attend special events, and amplify the call for second-chance opportunities in the United States. =Congressional resolutions= Prison Fellowship asked Senators Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Robert Portman, R-Ohio, to take the lead with the United States Senate resolution to declare April 2017 as Second Chance Month. Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., and Richard Durbin, D-Ill., also co-sponsored the resolution.

The building was designed in the German national romanticism style (art Nouveau, mixed with local building traditions). The 25-meter tower has become the architectural dominant of the upper town.

Studying at the Sorbonne, in 1913, she received the first PhD in natural sciences awarded to a Polish woman. Considered a pioneer in establishing earth sciences in Poland, she published over 100 works concerning the geography and geology of the country. Her 5 volume bibliography on the history of earth sciences in Poland is considered her greatest achievement. She was awarded the 1st Class Banner of the Order of Labor in 1960. Early life Regina Zofia Danysz was born on 28 March 1888 in Wi≈õniewo in the Siedlce Governorate of Russian Poland to Piotr Danysz. Her parents owned a small estate in Brus√≥w, where she was raised and completed her elementary education. She went on to study in Warsaw and Kiev, before moving to Zurich in 1906. Focusing her education on geography, Danysz moved to Paris in 1907, to attend lectures on geography and geology, participating in research trips during the semester breaks to the Tatra Mountains and Kujawy, which were led by . In 1910, she received her licenci√©e in science from the University of Paris in 1910, continuing on with doctoral studies. Studying with Eugeniusz Romer and Charles V√©lain, she prepared a thesis, Etude critique d'une carte ancienne de Pologne dres√©e par Stanislas Staszic (1806) (Critical study of an old map of Poland created by Stanislas Staszic [1806]) which analyzed his topographical work in the Carpathian Mountains. Early in 1913, she received the first PhD of natural sciences awarded to a Polish woman. Career Beginning in 1912, Danysz lectured on topology and was active in the Rifle Association, as well as the women's legionnaires. She began her career in 1913 working with Romer, who was at the University of Lviv, compiling information on atmospheric precipitation over various locations throughout Poland. While working with Romer, she met a fellow geologist, , whom she would later marry. Danysz and Romer published their findings in Warsaw in 1913. Moving to Zakopane around 1915, she became active in the press for women's rights and served as chair of the Council of Polish Women (), attending the European conventions of the International Council of Women in Brussels, Dubrovnik and Edinburgh. She and Felszar married and had a son, Mieczys≈Çaw Albin. The couple worked together on geological surveys in the Carpathian Mountains. After her husband's death in 1916, Fleszarowa and her son moved to Warsaw, where she worked for a short time at the Ministry of Public Enlightenment. In 1918, she helped found the Polish Geographical Society (). In 1919, Fleszarowa became the librarian for the National Geological Institute in Warsaw. and acquired a collection of over 30,000 volumes during her tenure, which lasted until World War II. She simultaneously continued her research, publishing articles such as Stanis≈Çaw Staszic jako przyrodnik (Stanis≈Çaw Staszic as a naturalist, 1926) and Spis jaski≈Ñ krajowych (List of National Caves, 1933) in scientific journals. Between 1920 and 1939, Fleszarowa published 18 texts for the Geological Bibliography of Poland. She also worked as an editor for Ziemia, the journal of the Geographical Society starting in 1929. Over her lifetime, Fleszarowa published over 100 articles on the scientific history and geography of Poland, including compiling studies of Russian scientists on Polish territories, gathering information through questionnaires about the geological work done during the Occupation, as well as publishing a biographical dictionary of Polish geologists. Fleszarowa was appointed in 1935 to serve as a Senator by the President of the Polish Republic. During her tenure, she focused on formal organization of scientific pursuits and expanding the rights of citizens. In 1937 was one of the organizers of the Democratic Club of Warsaw, serving as its vice-president and Democratic Alliance Party. Her Senate term ended in 1938 and during the Occupation of Poland, she joined the underground movement, participating in the Home Army. Working in developing information and propaganda for the Home Army, she distributed maps and published literature,setting up an editorial office for underground writings. She worked to hide Jews, and led secret meeting of librarians, leading the effort to hide the archive of the Association of Polish Librarians. Fleeing the city before the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, Fleszarowa went to Lublin and worked as a contact to the Polish Committee of National Liberation. In October 1944, she was appointed head of the Library Department of the Ministry of Education. In 1945, she served as co-founder in reorganizing the Women's League and was appointed to serve in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Party government. Participating in peace conferences held in Moscow, Paris, Potsdam and Prague, she was one of the cartographers who delineated the western Polish border. From 1945 to 1948, she served on the City Council of Warsaw. In 1951 she began working at the Museum of Earth for the Polish Academy of Sciences. She prepared a bibliography on the history of earth sciences in Poland, covering a 200 year period, prior to her retirement in 1958. This work was her \\"greatest scientific achievement\\", covering material from the mid-eighteenth century through the mid-twentieth century in 5 volumes. The first volumes, published in 1957 covered the twentieth century and the last volume, published in 1966 covered the material through the end of the 19th century, summarizing documents found in the records published by the Polish Geological Institute. Because she retired before the second volume was published, other editors worked to complete the publishing. After her retirement, Fleszarowa continued her work with the Women's League and attending meetings of the Polish Academy of Sciences, publishing works such as the Materia≈Çach i Studiach z Dziej√≥w Nauki Polskiej (Materials and Studies of the History of Polish Science) and two extensive studies. One of them evaluated the 200 year old geological map of Poland by J. S. Guetard and the other discussed Warsaw as it was described in The Physiographic Diary between 1881 and 1921. In 1960, she was awarded the 1st Class Banner of the Order of Labor. Death and legacy Fleszarowa died on-board ship during a cruise on the Vistula river on 30 June or 1 July 1969. She was buried in Warsaw's PowƒÖzki Cemetery. Her masterwork on the bibliography on the history of earth sciences has been supplemented by later scientists and she is viewed as a pioneer for establishing the field of earth science in Poland.

Sterrett (1815‚ÄìJune 18, 1879) was a ship captain and investor. Career Advertisement for steam packets between New Orleans and Galveston, 1852 John H. Sterrett was born around 1815 in Pennsylvania. He was already operating steamboats as early as 1838 in Ohio and Pennsylvania. He redeployed his small steamer, Rufus Putnam, to New Orleans later in 1838, and then to the Republic of Texas in January 1839. He offered packet service on Buffalo Bayou and Galveston Bay, which included the towns of Houston and Galveston, Texas. Sterrett also invested and managed transportation companies. In 1851, he invested in the Houston and Galveston Navigation Company, a company headed by William Marsh Rice. Sterrett also managed the company‚Äôs fleet.Hall (2012), p. 49. Buffalo Bayou and Galveston Bay were venues for many impromptu steamboat races. Sterrett participated in some of these, and one of these ended in catastrophe. On March 22, 1853, he was racing Captain Webb of Farmer, a vessel which Sterrett himself had recently mastered. The boiler of Farmer exploded, killing about half of the ship's seventy-two persons on board. Local newspapers gave Sterrett mixed revues: they acknowledged his heroism in turning Neptune around to rescue some of Farmer's passengers and crew, but charged him with recklessness for participating in the deadly race. The incident may have had a sobering effect on Sterrett, who was later was known for the safety of his shipping operations.Hall (2012), pp. 5152.Sibley (1968), p. 71. In 1854, Rice and other investors of the Houston and Galveston Navigation Company formed a new company. Sterrett would again serve as a managing partner in the Houston Navigation Company, which started with a strategy of competing for United States Mail contracts. Galveston was a transportation hub, controlling traffic for 150,000 pieces of mail from the eastern United States to Texas and California.Hall (2012), pp. 5657. Sterrett was the superintendent of the Houston Navigation Company's fleet, and he assumed a similar role for the Texas Marine Department during the Civil War.Hall (2012), p. 67. His responsibility included the Brazos, Sabine, and Trinity rivers, as well as the Galveston Bay system, where the Texas Marine Department operated as many as thirteen steamships.Hall (2012), 8081. Months after the war, he acquired two Union tinclads, Silver Cloud and St. Clair, and converted them for civilian service between Houston and Galveston.Hall (2012), pp. 8384. Houston Navigation Company did not survive the war, so he ran his own packet service in 1865 and 1866. In October 1866, William Marsh Rice, the City of Houston, and many investors from the previous firm organized the Houston Direct Navigation Company. They tapped Sterrett as the new company's fleet superintendent and appointed him as one of the officers. In addition, he coordinated lightering, or the transfer of freight from one ship to another without the benefit of a wharf. This enabled the company to obviate the high wharfage fees at the port of Galveston. He also purchased two tugboats for pulling barges laden with cotton as an efficient means of conveying freight.Hall (2012), pp. 8689. Sterrett retired from Houston Direct Navigation Company in 1875.Hall (2012), p. 102. He piloted steamers between Galveston and Houston 4,000 times throughout his career.Sibley (1968), pp. 7071.

It is found in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean off the coasts of Brazil and Argentina. It was first described in 1829 by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier. Description Charles Darwin records the crew catching this fish with hook and line off the coast of northern Patagonia, at a time when the Beagle was anchored during bad weather. He described it as being chestnut brown above, banded transversely with black on the head, flanks and fins. The lower lip was pink and the underside of the fish was white. The eyes had yellow irises and black pupils. Distribution and habitat Pinguipes brasilianus occurs in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil southwards to Golfo Nuevo in Argentina. It has also been reported from the Mediterranean Sea, but its presence there is thought to have been as a result of an accidental introduction in ballast water. It is a demersal fish and its depth range is between . Reproduction Breeding takes place over an extended period of spring and summer, peaking between October and February. Females reach 50% maturity at an average total length of about and have a fecundity ranging from 2 to 44 oocytes per gram for medium size fish. The gonadosomatic index for males ranges between 0.11% and 0.75%. Both these figures are low and necessitates the pair being in close proximity when spawning takes place. The female releases several batches of eggs during the breeding season in a cycle involving courtship and pair bonding, the egg release sometimes taking place in a crevice in the reef.

Early History of Alliance for Smiles Alliance for Smiles was founded in October of 2004 by Anita Stangl, Burt Berry, James Patrick, Jim Deitz, John Goings, and John Uth. Dr Karin Vargervik, D.D.S., previous director of the Craniofacial Center at the University of California San Francisco, was chosen to lead the AfS treatment center program, which aims to create international treatment centers that replicate the U.S. protocol of cleft treatment. Programs Alliance for Smiles organizes international volunteer missions to provide cleft lip and cleft palate repair in under-served communities, manages programs to assist hot countries in reaching cleft lip and cleft palate repair self-sufficiency, and organizes an international medical fellowship program for pre-med students entering the medical field. Surgical missions Alliance for Smiles organizes two-week surgical missions to provide free cleft lip and palate surgery in various under-served countries. The team consists of about 12 medical professionals and 4 non-medical volunteers. During a typical mission, 70 to 100 children receive surgical care. The AfS team collaborates with local medical practitioners to communicate on proper medical procedures and to give follow-up treatment. Follow-up care is often required because a patient may need follow-up surgeries, orthodontic treatment, speech therapy, and other medical care.  Teaching missions  During teaching missions Alliance for Smiles sends a small team of medical professionals to train local doctors and nurses on how to operate on very complex cleft cases.  International Medical Fellowship program  The International Medical Fellowship is a 14-day opportunity for students interested in the medical field to learn about cleft surgeries by supporting and observing doctors and nurses on an AfS mission.

In some places, the temperance movement has led to alcohol prohibition in India, with many temperance organisations continuing their work today.  History  In the 19th and 20th centuries, the temperance movement in India was well connected with the Temperance movement in Great Britain and the missionary movements of the United States. The World Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WWCTU) began organizing local unions there as early as August of 1887 with the arrival of Mary Greenleaf Clement Leavitt who toured the country for nearly a year, leaving Mrs. M.D. MacDonald (a Scottish Presbyterian missionary) as the provisional national president. When Pandita Ramabai opened her school for young Hindu widows in Mumbai in the spring of 1889, the WWCTU supported her work and commissioned her as a WCTU National Lecturer. In August 1893, the WCTU of India was officially organized and based in Lucknow with Jeannette Hauser appointed in a paid position as president. In 1907, Sir Bhalchandra Kishna, the president of the Bombay Temperance Council, said that the cause of temperance as one that would unite people from all castes and religions. The Punjab Legislative Assembly enacted pro-temperance legislation in 1919. In June 1919, the South Indian Missionary Association, a Christian association, adopted a resolution supporting the efforts of Hindu and Muslim reformers pushing for the government to impose complete prohibition in India. In 1921, William E. Johnson toured India for the Anglo-Indian Temperance Society and the World League Against Alcoholism, giving temperance speeches that were popular among crowds. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) became established in India, printing the Indian Temperance News and White Ribbon. It aided Indians, both Christian and non-Christian, in fighting against alcohol. J.H. Chitamber, the wife of India's first bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, served as the president of the WCTU during this time. The temperance movement in India became closely tied with the Indian independence movement as Mahatma Gandhi viewed alcohol as being a foreign importation. He viewed foreign rule as the reason that national prohibition was not yet established at his time. Starting in 1914, Indians peacefully picketed saloons under Gandhi's direction, which resulted in decreased alcohol consumption among Indians. Upon India's independence in 1947, several states implemented prohibition, with some, such as Gujarat introducing it later. In 2016, many women blamed in the state of Tamil Nadu alcohol for societal ills, such as domestic violence, and thus took to the polls to elect a pro-prohibition leader. Their effort succeeded and when Jayaram Jayalalithaa was voted in, she shutdown five hundred liquor shops on her first day in office. In 2017, women agitated for temperance and the prohibition of alcohol in the state of Bihar; they campaigned for the election of Nitish Kumar, who upon the request of women, pledged that he would prohibit alcohol. Since signing prohibition legislation, \\"Murders and gang robberies are down almost 20 percent from a year earlier, and riots by 13 percent. Fatal traffic accidents fell by 10 percent.\\" Temperance organisations, such as AMADA and the WCTU, continue their work in India, focusing on anti-alcohol legislation and health education.

Early life and education  Tuttle was born and raised in Santa Cruz, studied physics at the University of California, Santa Cruz and graduated with a B.Sc in 2001. From 2001 to 2002, she worked for Add-Vision in Scotts Valley as a research scientist, and was part of the team that built the first screen- printed polymer light emitting diodes. Tuttle received a M.Sc and M.Phil in astronomy from Columbia University in 2006 and 2007, and obtained her Ph.D in 2010, working with David Schiminovich on the Faint Intergalactic medium Redshifted Emission Balloon (FIREBall). Tuttle built the world's first fiber fed ultraviolet spectrograph, which launched on FIREBall in 2009.  Research and career  FIREBall (Faint Intergalactic Redshifted Emission Balloon), an experiment aimed at measuring emission from the intergalactic and circumgalactic medium in the ultraviolet, during launch Tuttle's research applies novel hardware approaches to spectrograph instrumentation design, particularly aimed to isolate star formation regulation in galaxies through emission and infall from the interstellar medium. During her Ph.D. at Columbia, Tuttle designed the spectrograph for FIREBall, a balloon-borne telescope that is coupled to an ultraviolet spectrograph and designed to discover the intergalactic medium (IGM) in emission. The FIREBall spectrograph built by Tuttle was the world's first fiber fed ultraviolet spectrograph and placed upper constraints on IGM emission. Nine of Tuttle's VIRUS spectrograph units awaiting testing for later installation on the Hobby Eberly Telescope. Tuttle served as the lead for the Hobby‚ÄìEberly Telescope's VIRUS detector from 2010 until 2012, where she prototyped, finalized and characterized the VIRUS spectrograph. The instrument consists of 156 spectroscopic channels fed by 34944 fiberoptic channels, covering a 22 arcminute field of view. Tuttle and her colleagues' current astrophysics work still utilizes VIRUS data. In 2016 she joined the University of Washington as an assistant professor. As of May 2019, Tuttle was leading the recommissioning of the KOSMOS spectrograph for the Apache Point Observatory, an instrument originally stationed at Kitt Peak Observatory. Her science-outreach work includes appearances on the podcast 365 Days of Astronomy in 2009 and writing for The Toast in 2014. She regularly appears as an astronomy expert in articles in the Seattle Times, the Mercury News and Gizmodo. In 2014, the National Academy of Sciences honored her as a Kavli Fellow. Tuttle has also contributed to American Astronomical Society workshops and supported new guidelines to build a more diverse and inclusive environment. Activism Tuttle was a board member and hotline operator for the Lilith Fund until 2016, a reproductive-rights nonprofit that provides Texas women with financial support for obtaining abortions. She currently serves on the board of Kadima, a Seattle-based reconstructionist Jewish community. Her 2015 response to Tim Hunt's statements about women in the laboratory drew international coverage and was featured on BuzzFeed. In an interview with Chanda Prescod-Weinstein during the buildup to the 2017 March for Science, the Washington Post cited a group statement by Tuttle, Prescod- Weinstein and Joseph Osmundson on The Establishment. Their article entitled \\"We Are The Scientists Against A Fascist Government\\" called for greater participation of scientists in politics and compared the political situation in the United States to early-1930s Germany.

She served the Royal Navy as a hired armed cutter between 1795 and 1800. From 1801 she was a merchantman, sailing primarily between Dover and Exmouth. She is last listed in 1808. Career Duchess of Yorks early career is obscure. She does not appear in Lloyd's Register until after her service with the Royal Navy. Hired armed cutter: The Admiralty employed Duchess of York as a hired armed cutter. Records suggest that her contract ran from 9 March 1795 to 2 January 1799. However, there is little record of her activities prior to 1799, and there are several accounts of her activities as a cutter in 1800. The brig Pelican, loaded with barley, arrived at Portsmouth on 5 February 1799, after Duchess of York had recaptured her.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 1, p.260. During the evening of 29 January 1800, off Le Havre, captured the French privateer lugger Vigoureaux (or Vigoreaux). Vigoureaux was armed with three guns, had a crew of 26 men and was 19 days out of Cherbourg, not having taken anything. Duchess of York was in sight. Vigoureux had been commissioned in 1799.Demerliac (2004), n¬∞3110, p.324. Lloyd's List reported on 21 February that Honfleur and Dorade, two prizes to the cutters Duchess of York and Fly, had arrived at Portsmouth.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4026. Duchess of York, under the command of Lieutenant Lundy, arrived at Portsmouth on 4 April from a cruise off Havre. She brought in with her the brig Alexander, which had come from Lisbon and had been bound for Altona, Hamburg. Duchess of York had intercepted Alexander going into Havre with a cargo of fruit, etc.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p.329. This capture gave rise to a court case in 1800 in which Alexanders owners challenged her seizure. The facts of the case, per the owner, a Danish merchant, that he had purchased Alexander, of Altona, on 15 March 1799 at Saint-Malo. She sailed to Altona in ballast. There she took on a cargo to Lisbon, and was under orders to return to Altona. At Lisbon she took in a cargo of cotton, coffee, sugar, &c.; When ready to sail from Lisbon she had a fortnight's old sound provisions on board, but her master chose to purchase a barrel of beef and a hundred weight of biscuit. She departed from Lisbon on 9 March, and on the 15th, being off the coast of France, the crew discovered that the purchased beef was offensive and bad. The captain, although he had twenty days good old provisions, decided to sail for the first port in France for more. That port was Havre de Grace.Naval Chronicle, Vol., p.78. In the case it was proved the master knew that Havre de Grace was under a British blockade. About four leagues from Havre, Duchess of York came up under French colours, and after examination, seized Alexander for having broken the neutrality. At the time there was another cutter in sight. The attorney for Alexander argued that she was in want of provisions, and that a further elucidation was unnecessary. The Judge entered into the cause at full length. The ship and part of the cargo were condemned as prize to the two cutters. Merchantman: Duchess of York appears in Lloyd's Register for 1801 with J. Lucas, master, changing to J. Luckhurst, Rogers & Co. owner, and trade Exmouth‚ÄìDover. The entry gave her a launch year of 1790, and launch place of Dover.Lloyd's Register (1801), Seq.‚Ññ279. (The Register of Shipping for 1802 gave a launch year for of York of 1789, but otherwise agreed with Lloyd's Register.) This information continued unchanged to her last listing in 1808.

The first Mission Ship to be commissioned was the Alpha in 1900, followed by the Joseph & Sarah Miles, and the Queen Alexandra in 1902. As well as being hospital ships, they were all equipped with fishing-gear and sent their fish to market with the rest of the fleet. The great difference between a Mission ship and an ordinary trawler, in connection with fishing, was that Mission ships did not fish on Sundays, whereas very many of the ordinary steam-trawlers did. As a hospital ship the MV Joseph & Sarah Miles carried a surgeon and surgeon's mate, along with a crew capable of turning their hands to nursing. A complete surgical outfit of instruments was available, including the ability to take X-rays. The hospital contained two swing cots and four berths for patients. Wood (1911) argued that \\"A Mission ship is one of the most interesting vessels afloat. She is a cruising hospital, a place of worship, a tobacco shop, a clothing establishment, a free library, a club-room, an hotel, and a recreation ground. If a smacksman is sick or injured, he will be fetched on board and receive skilled attention until he is better; if he wants to attend service and hoists a signal to indicate his wish, the Mission boat will call for him\\".Wood, W.

Three British fishermen died and a number were wounded. One sailor and a priest aboard the Russian cruiser Aurora caught in the crossfire were also killed. The incident almost led to war between Britain and Russia.Dogger Bank 1904 - The Russian fleet attacks Hull trawlers. Scarborough Maritime Heritage Centre. http://www.scarboroughsmaritimeheritage.org.uk/article.php?article=79 Accessed 02/07/2018 The Russian warships illuminated the trawlers with their searchlights and opened fire. The British trawler Crane was sunk, and its captain and first mate were killed. Four other trawlers were damaged, and six other fishermen were wounded, one of whom died a few months later. As the trawlers had their nets down, they were unable to flee and, in the general chaos, Russian ships shot at each other. The Mission surgeon, Dr Anklesaria, who was on board the Joseph & Sarah Miles, looked after the wounded from the trawler Crane and gave the following account: \\"I have never witnessed such a gory sight. Two men lay on deck with their heads nearly blown to pieces. In the cabin the scene was more heartrending still. when I saw six men stretched about anyhow, bleeding and groaning with the agony of their wounds. Under the circumstances, I had them all removed on board our ship. With all these wounded men on board, our floating hospital looked like a veritable sight. It kept me busy with knife and needle the whole of that day, and it was not until late in the night that I had the satisfaction of seeing them all safe and snug in their cots, as far as circumstances allowed\\". World War I and post-war service  At the outbreak of war in 1914 the SS Joseph & Sarah Miles was requisitioned by the Admiralty, allocated pennant number 1132 and armed with a single 12 pounder naval gun. She served as a minesweeper throughout the hostilities until 15 April 1920, operating mainly out of Fleetwood.Royal Navy Auxiliary Patrol ships of World War 1, - based on British Warships, 1914-1919 by Dittmar and Colledge. https://www.naval-history.net/WW1NavyBritishShips- Dittmar4AP.htm Accessed 02/07/2018 In May 1920 the Fisheries Commissioners for England made available a grant for the charter of Joseph & Sarah Miles from the Fishermen's Mission, in order to restart fishery investigations, ahead of the RV George Bligh coming into service in April 1921. Between May 1920 and December 1922 the SS Joseph and Sarah Miles participated in 49 separate research cruises, primarily focused on herring - egg and larval surveys, plaice egg surveys, plaice tagging but also the study of benthic organisms on the Dogger Bank. Following return to her owners, the SS Joseph & Sarah Miles continued in service with the Fishermen's Mission until 1930.

To the east, the building is joined to Healy Hall and to the west, it is joined to New North, while the southern fa√ßade of the building encloses Dahlgren Quadrangle. Built in the Georgian style, Old North was one of the grandest buildings in Washington at the time of its completion in 1795. It served as the flagship of the university until the construction of Healy Hall. Old North currently houses the McCourt School of Public Policy.  History   Construction and early uses  In the 18th century, the nascent Georgetown College, with only one building on its campus in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., was in continual need of additional space. Therefore, in 1792, with all of the college's facilities housed within the South Building (which was demolished in 1904), land was purchased for the construction of an additional building. Construction started in 1794 on what became known as the North Building, and work on its edifice was completed by 1795. The architect is believed to have been Leonard Harbaugh, the Baltimore-based designer of Holy Trinity Chapel. The building was modeled after Nassau Hall at Princeton University. Funding the construction of a building of its size was difficult for the school. The total cost of its initial construction exceeded ¬£10,000, a sum significantly greater than the revenue from the Jesuits' Maryland plantations, which were funding the project. The board of directors was required to raise tuition, cut President Robert Plunkett's salary by more than half, and make some payments in the form of cows raised on campus as barter, rather than in cash. The interior of the building was not complete until 1809, with an anonymous contribution of $400. Upon completion, the 154-foot-long building increased the amount of dormitory space on campus fourfold. It also housed classrooms, a refectory, and a chapel. The building finally opened for use in 1797. When construction of Old North was completed, many considered it \\"one of the grandest works in Washington, after the Capitol Building,\\" and it became the flagship building of the university. It was not until 1809 when, during the presidency of William Matthews, the building was totally complete. Until then, only the interior of the third floor had been finished; Matthews also added the two octagonal towers, which were an unusual addition to the Georgian-style building.  Civil War and beyond  alt=Black and white image of a smaller building on the left and a larger building on the right with a courtyard in between, surrounded by trees On May 4, 1861, during the Civil War, notice was given to President John Early that the 69th Infantry Regiment of New York would be commandeering Georgetown College's campus to quarter its 1,400 soldiers. The commandeering of the college lasted until June 4 of that year. Old North was exempt from this order, and the students of the college had to quickly remove all of their belongings to the Old North Building. Likewise, Old North was exempt from another order by the Surgeon General of the Army, on August 31, 1862 to convert Georgetown's facilities into a hospital for 500 patients. This exemption was due to intervention by General Amiel Weeks Whipple, whose two sons attended the college. alt=Black and white photograph of Healy Hall with Old North partially visible behind it With the school growing, Georgetown embarked on the construction of Healy Hall. Architects Smithmeyer and Pelz begin drafting designs for the building, with one such plan from 1876 depicting the fourth floor of Healy Hall overlapping the footprint of Old North, suggesting that they had considered the demolition of the Old North building. When Healy Hall was completed immediately adjacent to the building, Old North lost its status as the flagship of the university and its grandeur was diminished in comparison. An area to the south of the building was eventually enclosed by a fence, and became referred to as The Yard. The space was used by the student athletic association formed in 1891 for recreation. Over time, \\"The Yard\\" became a metonym for the athletic association, which grew to assume broader functions, eventually becoming Georgetown's student government; hence, the former name of the student government is The Yard. The courtyard between Old North and Old South‚Äîthe area roughly coextensive with Dahlgren Quadrangle today‚Äîinitially left the southern entrance of Old North to be at ground level. It was not until 1893 that the quadrangle was sunken and a staircase to the south entrance constructed.  Recent uses  alt=Black and white photograph of the fa√ßade brick building with two towers attached to the front. Roofs of cars are visible in the foreground In 1981, Georgetown began a two-year renovation of Old North in order to repurpose it from housing dormitories and classrooms to the new home of the School of Business Administration (the school had not yet been renamed the School of Business or, even later, the McDonough School of Business). This renovation also involved outfitting the north fa√ßade of the building with a new entrance. The building was rededicated in 1983 with a conferral of an honorary doctorate of humane letters on President Gerald Ford by Georgetown President Timothy Healy, followed by a ceremonial ribbon-cutting by the two. Part of this renovation was the design and construction of an exterior fire escape for Old North at its junction with Healy Hall, the design of which incorporated architectural elements from the two buildings. The metal structure won awards from the Washington and Mid-Atlantic chapters of the American Institute of Architects. Old North was again renovated in 2013, with all across its five floors being refurbished. This entailed the removal of the wooden beams in the attic that had long-since lost their structurally supporting role and were merely decorative. This renovation was to accommodate the relocation of the Georgetown Public Policy Institute to Old North. The institute's successor, the McCourt School of Public Policy now resides in the building.  Presidents' steps  alt=Black and white photograph of fa√ßade of building with fountain and courtyard in background. Tops of towers located behind the building are visible over its roof Plaque on the building commemorating the presidential visits On August 7, 1797, George Washington, two of whose grandnephews had previously been students at Georgetown, gave a speech on the southern steps of Old North to a group assembled in Dahlgren Quadrangle. This established a precedent for presidents to speak on the same steps of the building, as well as the more general tradition of presidents visiting the building. The next president to make an appearance on the steps was John Quincy Adams. He attended a commencement of Georgetown College on July 25, 1825 and another on July 30, 1827. At the former ceremony, he was joined by the Secretary of State and several members of the diplomatic corps, and he assisted the president of the college in distributing diplomas to the graduates. President Andrew Jackson accepted an invitation to attend the commencement of July 28, 1829, however, he fell ill and did not ultimately make a trip to Georgetown. Therefore, the next president to visit Old North was John Tyler on July 26, 1841 for the annual commencement. Like Adams, he assisted with the distribution of diplomas. Tyler again attended graduation on July 26, 1842, and his son enrolled in the school the following fall. On September 28, 1845, President James K. Polk and the First Lady Sarah Childress Polk visited James Polk's nephew, Marshall Polk, who was a student at Georgetown. On July 24, 1849, President Zachary Taylor partook in the commencement exercises at Old North. He additionally made a visit on October 5, 1849, and the occasion was marked by suspending classes for the afternoon. The graduation of 1854 was attended by President Franklin Pierce on July 11, and he paid additional visits to the College on June 5 and November 6 of 1856. He was invited to attended another graduation of 1856 but did not attend due to inclement weather. President James Buchanan, whose nephew, Joseph B. Henry, was a student at the school for two years, partook in graduation on July 7, 1857 and was joined by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Interior. Buchanan again attended a graduation ceremony on July 6, 1859. One of the most significant moments on the steps was when Abraham Lincoln addressed Union Army troops of the 69th Infantry Regiment of New York from the steps during their commandeering of part of the College's campus in May 1861 as part of his review of the troops temporarily quartered on campus. During the Civil War, Old North served as a temporary hospital for Union soldiers. President Andrew Johnson visited the campus on July 3, 1867 while his son, Andrew F. Johnson was enrolled in the school, and delivered a speech, which was followed by a light meal. President Ulysses Grant also visited the building that year, when he attended graduation, which was described as \\"Exhibition Day\\" in the house diary of the college. Accordingly, Grant distributed prizes to the students, and was later joined by former president Johnson after the departure of the students. It was at this graduation that the rector of the school, in his speech, observed the tradition of every president since George Washington joining the graduating class at the annual ceremony. President Gerald Ford visited the building in 1983. In January 1993, President-elect and Georgetown alumnus Bill Clinton addressed the Diplomatic Corps from the steps of Old North. , 14 American presidents have visited Old North or have spoken on the steps, the most recent of which was Barack Obama, who gave a major address on climate change in 2016.

In 1924, it changed its name to the Association of Architects, Surveyors and Technical Assistants, and its membership and influence increased into the 1930s, as it became associated with left-wing ideas in architecture. Its membership included some prominent members of the Communist Party of Great Britain, such as Francis Skinner and Graeme Shankland, and the union's leadership was also composed of party members. In 1942, the union renamed itself again, this time as the Association of Building Technicians. It gradually declined in membership until 1970, when it merged with the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers and the Amalgamated Society of Painters and Decorators, forming the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers and Painters.

She co-founded, and for over 25 years served as Co-CEO of TransPerfect, the world's largest language solutions provider. In 2016 and 2017, she was named to Forbes magazine's list of the Richest Self- Made Women, with a net worth of $420 million. Since leaving TransPerfect in 2018 following a lengthy legal battle with co-founder Phil Shawe that resulted in a buyout, Elting has been serving as Founder and CEO of the Elizabeth Elting Foundation, focusing on advocacy for women in the workplace. Her advocacy work has received recognition from the National Organization of Women. Early life & education Elting was born in Westchester County, New York to Everett Elting, an advertising executive, and Judy Elting, an educator. Her family traveled frequently, including long-term residences in Portugal and Canada, where Elting first developed interest in studying languages. In Toronto, a young Elting worked at many jobs over the years including as an usherette for the Toronto Blue Jays. She speaks English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Latin and earned a BA in Modern Languages and Literatures from Trinity College in 1987, and her MBA from NYU Stern School of Business in 1992. Professional career After graduating from Trinity College, Elting interned in Caracas in the finance department of a cement company and then worked at a language services company in New York City, and interned at Moody‚Äôs Investors Service during graduate school. Very briefly after graduation, Elting worked in the proprietary trading division of a French bank; however, she quickly grew dissatisfied with the ‚Äúboys‚Äô club‚Äù atmosphere and the expectation that she would perform administrative and secretarial work alongside her official responsibilities, and left to found her own company. Having spent several years working in the translation industry, Elting felt there was a need for a service-minded enterprise that could deliver complex projects quickly and accurately. To that end, Elting co- founded TransPerfect in 1992 out of an NYU dorm room. Elting served as co-CEO of TransPerfect for almost 26 years, during which it became the world's largest provider of language and business solutions.

The company was a winner of the 2015 SmartCEO Corporate Culture Awards and was also recognizes by SmartCEO as a ‚ÄúFuture 50‚Äù company five years running. During her tenure, TransPerfect was also awarded ‚ÄúBest Translation Solution‚Äù by the Internet Marketing Association for three consecutive years. It was also named one of the fastest-growing women-owned/led businesses in North America by Entrepreneur and the Women Presidents' Organization. Elting left TransPerfect in 2018. She currently serves as Founder and CEO of the Elizabeth Elting Foundation. Corporate divorce In May 2018, the Delaware Supreme Court upheld a decision causing the sale of Elting's 50% ownership of TransPerfect to cofounder Phil Shawe for $770 million, which closed the same month. Political views & opinions Elting, through her regular column at Forbes, has articulated a vision of aggressive advancement of women's rights through professional and entrepreneurial development and advancement and women's health. Vocal about women's equality, she strongly advocates for women to act forcefully in the workplace and to own and operate their own businesses, arguing that economic power is social power.

However, it has more commonly been used to refer to a prominent traditional chieftaincy title among the Yoruba people. History Across various Yoruba markets and the states they belong to, an Iyaloja is usually democratically chosen by her constituents (and is thereafter confirmed by the oba) or single-handedly chosen by the oba himself. In rare situations, like the case of the Iyaloja of Lagos in 2013, the deceased Iyaloja can choose her successor before her death. Historically, the Iyaloja of Lagos is referred to as \\"Iyaloja of Nigeria\\", despite the existence of other Iyalojas across various Yoruba-dominated states. Research into the ancient culture and tradition of the Yoruba people has shown that despite the chieftaincy structure being largely patriarchal, the female titleholders Iyalode, Iyaloja and Iyalaje are three of the most important leaders in the system, figures whose opinions carried as much weight as those of the male chiefs. An equivalent male title known as Babaloja, meaning Father of the Market, is also functionally a subordinate of the Iyaloja. List of \\"Iyalojas of Nigeria\\" {  - !Name !Reign - Abibatu Mogaji 1980s-2013 - Folashade Tinubu 2013-present } Controversies On January 1, 2017, the News Agency of Nigeria reported that the Iyaloja of Ibadan, Chief Labake Lawal, had been impeached for financial misconduct by the \\"Ibadan Joint Traders Association\\". The supposedly removed Iyaloja later played down her removal, explaining that only the traditional monarch, the Olubadan of Ibadanland, had the authority to appoint or replace the Iyaloja. On May 9 2017, after the appointment of Alhaja Iswat Abiola Ameringun as the new Iyaloja by the Olubadan, Chief Lawal described her removal as a show of ethnic bias and a reflection of a lack of due process as only the Olubadan-in- Council was capable of removing her. A new development ensued when most of the members of the traditional council disagreed with the decision from the Olabadan and posited that the removal of Chief Lawal did not represent the position of most of the cabinet members. Further to this, Chief Labake Lawal sued the Olubadan, Olubadan-in-Council and the newly installed Iyaloja for \\"violating her right to natural justice\\", urging the court to declare the new appointment \\"null, void and of no legal effect\\". In July 2013, it was reported that the daughter of former governor of Lagos State, Chief Bola Ahmed Tinubu, had been selected as the new Iyaloja of Lagos and the rest of Nigeria, pending the granting of official approval by the Oba of Lagos. This immediately caused a media storm, as critics argued that she wasn't qualified in terms of age and market experience. Others contended that it was a strategy by Chief Tinubu to acquire more power for his family among Lagosians. The market leader for Lagos Mainland local government opined that her appointment was a collective one and was not politically influenced. The Secretary General for Lagos Markets explained that her ascension was lawful, and in accordance with the market association's statutes. She also stated that she met the minimum requirement needed to be an Iyaloja. It was also reported that Folashade was the choice of the late Iyaloja. Despite these apparent hindrances to her coronation, on October 29 2013, Folashade Tinubu-Ojo was officially installed as the new Iyaloja. Those present at the ceremony included her stepmother, Oluremi Tinubu, the Oba of Lagos, and the Alake of Egbaland.

Family life John Richardson Harris was born on October 22, 1790 to John and Mary (Richardson) Harris in Cayuga, New York. After serving in the War of 1812, he married Jane Birdsall, and they took residence near Waterloo, New York. Their first sons were born there: DeWitt Clinton Harris and Lewis Birdsall Harris. The family migrated to Ste. Genevieve, Missouri in 1819, where Mary Jane Harris and John Birdsall Harris were born. Gone to Texas Harris prepared to locate to Texas at the urging of Moses Austin. To prepare for this gamble, he resettled his family in upstate New York. In 1823, he sailed his boat from New Orleans to Buffalo Bayou, where he scouted locations for a trading post. Harris was granted a league of land at Buffalo Bayou on 16 August 1824. He contracted for a town plat of Harrisburg in 1826, while he established a trading post and a grist mill there. He named the new town for Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the namesake of his great-grandfather. In addition to the grist mill, he ran a saw mill with the assistance of his two brothers, David Harris and William Plunkett Harris, and his business partner, Robert Wilson. They also offered carpentry and blacksmithing services. Harris and Wilson managed a small fleet of sailing ships, which imported trade goods from the United States and Mexico, and exported cotton and lumber. John Richardson and David Harris founded a second trading post at Bell‚Äôs Landing, Texas. Death and legacy Harris started building what was the first steam saw mill in Texas. With machine belts needed to complete the project, he sailed to New Orleans. He arrived amidst a yellow fever epidemic and died there on August 21, 1829. In 1833, two parties filed claims on the John Harris Richardson estate. Wilson and William Plunkett Harris claimed the real estate and equipment as their own. John Richardson Harris‚Äôs widow, Jane Harris, and DeWitt Clinton Harris arrived in Texas for the first time to make a competing claim. In 1836, Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen approached the Harrises to make a bid on the Harrisburg site, but ownership of the property had still not been settled. By 1838, Mary Jane Harris and her family constructed a house on that property and reorganized the town in order to sell lots. Harris County, Texas was named for John Richardson Harris.

The term metaphorically compares opposition to mainstream opinion to what is illicitly found on the dark web. The term was coined by Eric Weinstein, and was popularized in a 2018 editorial by Bari Weiss. Definition Sources differ on the nature of the IDW, with some describing it as left, and others as ideologically diverse, but nonetheless united against primary adversaries hailing predominantly from progressives, including postmodernism, post-structuralism, Marxism, and political correctness. Psychology Today characterized it as \\"generally concerned about political tribalism and free speech\\", or as a rejection of \\"mainstream assumptions about what is true\\". Salon dubbed it a politically conservative movement united more over a rejection of American liberalism than over any mutually shared beliefs. Alternatively, the National Review posited that, despite comprising \\"all political persuasions\\", the IDW was united in a particular conservative-leaning conceptualization of injustice and inequality specifically. Origin and usage Eric Weinstein, the director of an American venture capital firm, stated that when he coined the term he was \\"half- joking\\". This occurred after Weinstein's brother, biologist Bret Weinstein, resigned in 2017 from his position as professor of biology at The Evergreen State College in response to protests against his criticism of a campus event that asked white students to stay off campus, as opposed to the previous annual tradition of black students voluntarily absenting themselves. The website Big Think has argued that other controversies, dating back to 2014, should also be viewed as antecedents to the IDW. These include a debate between Sam Harris and Ben Affleck on Real Time with Bill Maher in October 2014, the publication of Google's Ideological Echo Chamber by James Damore in August 2017, and Cathy Newman's interview of Jordan Peterson on Channel 4 News in January 2018, each of which related to controversial topics such as Islamic extremism and workplace diversity policies. The term gained traction after a May 2018 opinion piece by then staff editor Bari Weiss in The New York Times titled \\"Meet the Renegades of the Intellectual Dark Web\\". Weiss characterized individuals she named as associated with the intellectual dark web as \\"iconoclastic thinkers, academic renegades and media personalities\\", who have been \\"purged from institutions that have become increasingly hostile to unorthodox thought\\", and who have instead taken to social media, podcasting, public speaking, and other alternative venues outside \\"legacy media\\". Weiss stated \\"the Intellectual Dark Web [is] a term coined half-jokingly by Mr. Weinstein\\". Reception Weiss's article sparked a number of critiques. Jonah Goldberg, writing in the National Review, said the \\"label is a bit overwrought\\", writing that it struck him \\"as a marketing label ‚Äî and not necessarily a good one: ...it seems to me this IDW thing isn't actually an intellectual movement. It‚Äôs just a coalition of thinkers and journalists who happen to share a disdain for the keepers of the liberal orthodoxy.\\" Henry Farrell, writing in Vox, expressed disbelief that conservative commentator Ben Shapiro or neuroscientist Sam Harris, both claimed to be among the intellectual dark web by Weiss, could credibly be described as either purged or silenced. Weiss' fellow New York Times columnist Paul Krugman noted the irony of claiming popular intellectual oppression by the mainstream, while publishing in the Times, among the most prominent newspapers in the nation. David A. French contended many of the critics were missing the point, and were instead inadvertently confirming \\"the need for a movement of intellectual free-thinkers.\\" In 2019, a study from the UFMG found a pattern of migration of viewers who comment on YouTube videos, from commenting on clips associated with the IDW and the \\"alt-lite\\" to commenting on more right-wing and/or alt- right videos. The study looked at over 331,000 videos that an algorithm had classified as right-wing, analyzed 79 million YouTube comments, and found a group that migrated from IDW channels to \\"alt-lite\\" channels, and then the alt-right channels. The subjects who left comments at an IDW channels were more likely to graduate after a few years to leaving significantly more comments on alt-right channels than the control group. The study's authors said they were not intending to \\"point fingers\\" rather draw attention to the effects of YouTube's recommendation algorithm, calling it an \\"almost totally algorithm-driven process.\\" Associated individuals According to Bari Weiss, individuals associated with the intellectual dark web include: * Ayaan Hirsi Ali * Jonathan Haidt * Sam Harris * Heather Heying * Claire Lehmann * Douglas Murray * Maajid Nawaz * Jordan Peterson * Steven Pinker * Joe Rogan * Dave Rubin * Ben Shapiro * Lindsay Shepherd * Michael Shermer * Debra W. Soh * Christina Hoff Sommers * Bret Weinstein * Eric Weinstein Although those associated with the IDW primarily criticize the political left, \\"some claim to lean to the left, others to the right\\". Nick Fouriezos of Ozy Magazine describes IDW as \\"a growing school of thought that includes a collection of mostly left-leaning professors, pundits and thinkers united in their criticism of the modern social justice movement as authoritarian and illogical.\\" Criticism of the IDW has come primarily from the left and support from the right. The Guardian characterized the IDW as strange bedfellows that nonetheless comprised the \\"supposed thinking wing of the alt-right\\", despite many associated individuals repeatedly expressing contempt for the alt-right, including Ben Shapiro, who is frequently a target of anti-semitism from the alt-right but whose arguments often include the viewpoint that it is cultural differences, rather than systemic racism, that causes disparities in wealth and other conditions in the United States. The Los Angeles Review of Books described the members as identifying with both the left and the right, but united against \\"primary adversaries\\" hailing predominantly from the left, including post-modernism, post-structuralism, Marxism, and political correctness in general, as well as being united against \\"the neo-fascist alt- right\\". Additionally, members routinely speak against identity politics, whether from the progressive left or the alt-right. The characterization of being an Alt-right group, for example, from the The Guardian, has been rejected by members of the IDW. Uri Harris, wrote in Quillette, a site founded by Claire Lehmann and described by Politico as the \\"unofficial digest\\" of the IDW, that the majority of the members of the IDW, such as Sam Harris and Daniel Miessler, skew toward the left, despite the fact that prominent conservatives are also considered members. Regarding the organization of the IDW, Daniel W. Drezner observed that it is essentially leaderless, and may be individually beholden to their audiences, and unable to progress a coherent agenda. Some writers, including Cathy Young, have expressed uncertainty over whether they belong in the intellectual dark web. For her part, historian of medicine and science Alice Dreger expressed surprise in being told she was a member of the IDW at all. After she was invited to be profiled in the New York Times article, she stated that she \\"had no idea who half the people in this special network were. The few Intellectual Dark Web folks I had met I didn't know very well. How could I be part of a powerful intellectual alliance when I didn't even know these people?\\" See also * Call-out culture * Heterodox Academy References Category:21st-century neologisms Category:American political neologisms Category:Anti-communism Category:Anti-Marxism Category:Criticism of political correctness Category:Criticism of postmodernism Category:Political philosophy Category:Identity politics Category:Words coined in the 2010s ","title":"Intellectual dark web"},{"id":"57815039","text":"Willie Philp was a Scottish professional football centre forward who played in the Scottish League for Cowdenbeath.

Characteristics View from Bisagno valley, in the foreground Colle di Creto The mountain stands on the main Apennine water divide, between Montoggio and Genoa comunes. Westwards the pass of Gola della Sisa (729 m) divides it from Mount Cornua while eastwards the Bisagno/Scrivia ridge goes on with Mount Lago. Mount Alpesisa is notable for its shape, which is trapezoidal when seen from Genoa but looks conical form other points of view. The slopes of the Alpesisa are mainly grassy. Its highest point, which belongs to an almost flat section of the ridge, is marked by a peculiar summit cross made with old leaf springs taken from a truck.  History  Summit cross In the past Mount Alpesisa was deforested and the grassland which still covers most of the mountain is in stark contrast with the surrounding woods. During the Italian Resistenza years Alpesisa, thanks to its outstanding location and the long-range views which offers, was for a long time manned by local partisans. Access to the summit  Mount Alpesisa can easily be accessed without any alpinistic skill. Its summit can be reached following a footpath starting from the 27th stage of Alta Via dei Monti Liguri named Colle di Creto - Passo della Scoffera, which surrounds the mountain on its Scrivia side. It also can be accessed following another foothpath climbing the val Bisagno slopes of the mountain and starting from the village of Prato (Struppa, comune of Genova).

It was located at M√•rk√¶r, Angeln, Southern Schleswig. M√•rk√¶r is now within Germany, under the name of Mohrkirch. Nevertheless, the monastery was throughout its existence within the Duchy of Schleswig, a hereditary possession of the Danish crown, and was therefore Danish not German.

It was the first such establishment by the Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony in any of the Nordic countries. They were a medical order, who specialised in treating sufferers from the condition called St. Anthony's Fire (now generally thought to be ergotism). In 1470, King Christian I of Denmark (1426-1481) gave the Church of the Virgin Mary in Pr√¶st√∏ to M√•rk√¶r Monastery. In 1472, the monks established a daughter monastery of their own in Pr√¶st√∏. His queen, Dorothea (1430/1431-1495), bequeathed 300 gulden to M√•rk√¶r Monastery. The monastery continued to prosper. In 1535, the monastery was dissolved as a consequence of the Reformation.

Many casualties were involved in fighting around Tilly-sur- Seulles. The graveyard has two chaplains interred in it; Reverend Cecil James Hawksworth and Reverend Gerard Nesbit and the grave of the youngest British soldier killed in Normandy, 16-year-old Private Jack Banks of the Durham Light Infantry.

During a career that has spanned over 40 years, George Miller has worked on projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. A few of the projects were made after he left production. 1990s Contact In 1993, Miller was hired to direct Contact based on the story by Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan. Contact commenced pre-production. Miller cast Jodie Foster in the lead role, approached Ralph Fiennes to play Palmer Joss and also considered casting Linda Hunt as the President of the United States. In addition to having aliens put on a laser lighting display around Earth, another version of the Goldenberg scripts had an alien wormhole swallow up the planet, transporting Earth to the center of the galaxy. Miller also asked Goldenberg to rewrite Contact in an attempt to portray the Pope as a key supporting character. Warner Bros. was hoping to have the film ready for release by Christmas 1996, but under Miller's direction pre-production lasted longer than expected. The studio fired the director, blaming pushed-back start dates, budget concerns, and Miller's insistence that the script needed five more weeks of rewriting after working on the film for over a year. Robert Zemeckis was eventually brought on to direct. 2000s Justice League: Mortal In 2007, Miller signed on to direct a Justice League film titled Justice League: Mortal. The following month roughly 40 actors and actresses were auditioning for the ensemble superhero roles, among them were Joseph Cross, Michael Angarano, Max Thieriot, Minka Kelly, Adrianne Palicki and Scott Porter. Miller intended to cast younger actors as he wanted them to \\"grow\\" into their roles over the course of several films. D. J. Cotrona was cast as Superman, along with Armie Hammer as Batman. Jessica Biel reportedly declined the Wonder Woman role after being in negotiations. The character was also linked to actresses Teresa Palmer and Shannyn Sossamon, along with Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who confirmed that she had auditioned. Ultimately Megan Gale was cast as Wonder Woman, while Palmer was cast as Talia al Ghul, whom Miller had in mind to act with a Russian accent. The script for Justice League: Mortal would have featured the John Stewart character as the Green Lantern, a role originally offered to Columbus Short. Hip hop recording artist and rapper Common was cast, with Adam Brody as The Flash / Barry Allen, and Jay Baruchel as the lead villain, Maxwell Lord. Longtime Miller collaborator Hugh Keays-Byrne had been cast in an unnamed role, rumored to be Martian Manhunter. Aquaman had yet to be cast. Marit Allen was hired as the original costume designer before her untimely death in November 2007, and the responsibilities were assumed by Weta Workshop. While production was initially held up due to the 2007‚Äì08 Writers Guild of America strike, further production delays and the success of The Dark Knight led to Warner Bros. deciding to put the film on hold and pursue different options. The Odyssey film On October 17, 2008, Miller was planning on directing an adaptation of the Odyssey, set in space with Brad Pitt producing the movie for Warner Bros. On January 14, 2013, Warner Bros. revived the project, with a new script by James DiLapo, without Miller and Pitt‚Äôs involvements. Since then, there have been no further announcements. 2010s Fur Brigade On November 29, 2011, Doug Mitchell revealed that Miller was attatched to Fur Brigade, an animated bear movie. Since then, there have been no further announcements. Happy Feet 3 In a November 2011 interview, Miller was asked if he had any plans for Happy Feet Three. He replied by saying: \\"if you put a gun to my head and said, 'You have to come up with a story for Happy Feet 3,' I‚Äôd say shoot me. I would have no idea. I really would have no idea. The stories creep up on you. You just have to allow the stories to come, and then they get in like little ear worms in your head and they won‚Äôt go away. If that happens and we‚Äôve got the energy, we‚Äôll do a third one. If it doesn‚Äôt happen, it doesn‚Äôt happen. That‚Äôs the only way you can do it. It has to be authentic.

If something comes up that‚Äôs really exciting and I can convey that enthusiasm to other people, then there would be a third one.\\" Mad Max: Fury Road (sequels and spinoffs) In 2011, Miller and McCarthy found during the writing process for Mad Max: Fury Road that they had enough story material for two additional scripts. One of these, entitled Mad Max: Furiosa, had already been completed, and Miller hoped to film it after the release of Fury Road. In March 2015, during an interview with Esquire, Hardy revealed that he was attached to star in three more Mad Max films following Fury Road. In May 2015, Miller told Wired: \\"Should Fury Road be successful, I've got two other stories to tell.\\" Later in May, Miller revealed that plans for the sequel had changed and the fifth film in the franchise will instead be titled Mad Max: The Wasteland. In October 2015, Miller's team had two scripts for sequels which they ended up with during the writing process. Later that month, he clarified that Mad Max: The Wasteland was a working title for the sequel. Miller reaffirmed his intent to continue the franchise after reports to the contrary surfaced following an interview in January 2016. Miller also wants a Furiosa spin-off starring Charlize Theron as the one-armed female warrior. In November 2017, it was reported that a lawsuit filed by Miller's production company against Warner Bros. over a disputed $7 million bonus was likely to delay the production of any sequels. In July 2019, Miller told IndieWire: \\"There are two stories, both involving Mad Max, and also a Furiosa story. We're still solving, we've got to play out the Warners thing, it seems to be pretty clear that it's going to happen.\\" Production of the sequels and spinoffs were delayed until after the lawsuit was settled. In October 2020, a prequel titled Furiosa entered \\"advanced development\\" at Warner Bros., with Miller set to direct. Anya Taylor-Joy has been cast to portray a young Furiosa, while Chris Hemsworth and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II will also star. Miller will co-write the screenplay with Nico Lathouris, while Miller and Doug Mitchell will produce through their Kennedy Miller Mitchell banner. Akira remake In 2015, Miller was planning on directing Akira, the live-action remake of the film of the same name, but he left due to scheduling conflicts with Mad Max: Fury Road.

Despite being an apparently capable design it was withdrawn in 1928. Design Design was begun by Robert Coey who retired through ill health and completed by Richard Maunsell who was later to design the UK Southern Railway Schools 4-4-0. Equipped with a large diameter boiler and Schmidt superheater. It was unique for the GS&WR; and its successor the GSR in having inside Walschaerts valve gear. This design was at the limit achievable by a 4-4-0 within the axle weight restriction limits and it was weighed regularly to ensure compliance. The only change to the initial design was a later reduction in cylinder diameter Service Due to weight restrictions it served on the Dublin‚ÄîCork route only where from 1916 it later shared services with the new EA Watson designed 400 Class 4-6-0 against which engine 341 seems to have compared favourably. Withdrawal The locomotive was withdrawn in 1928 after just 15 years, three 400 class express locomotives were also retired shortly afterwards as surplus to requirements.

It is 4 kilometers from the municipal capital, Camale√±o. It can be reached via CA-887, which forks off the main road of CA-185 connecting Fuente D√© and Potes. History Until the thirteenth century, documents referred to Mogrovejo as \\"Luarna\\", the name of an old family from which the saint Turibius of Mogrovejo descended. According to the 19th century geographic dictionary by Pascual Madoz the council of Mogrovejo included eight neighborhoods or villages, which continue to remain independent population entities: Mogrovejo, Redo, Los Llanos, B√°rcena, Besoy, Sebrango, Llaves and Vallejo.Pascual Madoz, Diccionario geogr√°fico- estad√≠stico-hist√≥rico de Espa√±a y sus posesiones de Ultramar.

Gonen is an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, the founding director of the MicroED Imaging Center at UCLA and a Member of the Royal Society of New Zealand.  Education  Gonen attended the University of Auckland in New Zealand and graduated with a Bachelor of Science double major in Inorganic Chemistry and Biological Sciences, followed by First Class Honors in Biological Sciences in 1998. He then obtained a Doctor of Philosophy in Biological Science in 2002 from the University of Auckland for research with by Edward N. Baker and Joerg Kistler. Postdoctoral education was conducted at Harvard Medical School at the laboratory of Thomas Walz.  Research  Gonen's current research focuses on the structures and functions of medically important membrane proteins that are involved in homeostasis and method development in cryoEM, namely microcrystal electron diffraction (microED). He published the first atomic resolution structure determined by cryoEM detailing the structure of aquaporin-0 at 1.9√Ö resolution.  Development of microcrystal electron diffraction The Gonen laboratory spearheaded the use of electron diffraction for the determination of protein structure from 3D nano crystals in a frozen hydrated state. The method termed microED was established in 2013 with a proof of principle paper published in eLife. In 2014 continuous rotation MicroED was established and demonstrated. In 2015 the first novel structure was determined by MicroED for the protein alpha- synuclein at 1.4√Ö resolution in collaboration with David Eisenberg and in 2016 microED yielded 1√Ö resolution data from protein nanocrystals where the phase could be solved ab initio. MicroED has been used for drug discovery, determination of membrane proteins such as ion channels materials and small organic molecules studied in a frozen hydrated state and extended to sub atomic resolution better than 0.8√Ö.

They also defeated South Korea and Nigeria to end with a 3‚Äì0 record in the first round. Group I in Foshan also saw the South Americans topping the group, thereby qualifying to the quarter-finals. Their win against Poland won them the group. In the quarter-finals at Dongguan, Argentina defeated 2014 World Cup runners-up and 2016 Olympic silver medalists Serbia by 10 points to qualify to the semi-finals. France, which had defeated the United States in their own quarter-final match-up, faced the South Americans in the semi-final at Beijing. Luis Scola scored his tournament-high 28 points in the game, and Rudy Gobert was limited to just three points, which led to Argentina advancing to its first World Cup final since 2002, which was Scola's first.  Spain  The Spaniards finished on top of Group C in Guangzhou. The Europeans defeated Tunisia, Puerto Rico and Iran to end up undefeated going into the second round. At the second round Group J at Wuhan, Spain ran away winners of the group after defeating Italy and erstwhile undefeated team Serbia to finish the group stages with a 5‚Äì0 record. In the quarter-finals at Shanghai, Spain eliminated surprise qualifiers Poland, off the back of Ricky Rubio's near double-double of 19 points and nine assists, plus five rebounds. A pair of three-point shots was the difference late in the fourth quarter that prevented the Poles from cutting the lead. In the semi-final against Australia at Beijing, the Australians led by as many as 11 points in the third quarter, but the Spaniards came back to tie the game at the end of regulation, 71-all. In overtime, Marc Gasol and Patty Mills scored three-pointers, but with the game tied at 78-all, Mills was fouled, and converted both free-throws. Gasol was fouled himself on the next possession, and also made both of his foul shots. Matthew Dellavedova tried to win it at the buzzer, but missed, sending the game to double overtime. Spain opened the second overtime with two three- pointers, and that was the difference, qualifying them to their second World Cup final, after winning it in 2006. Game details Spanish players during a time-out in the final. This is the eighth meeting between Argentina and Spain at the World Cup, with the Spaniards winning five; Argentina won two, including their last meeting at the 2010 World Championship. Spain won the last competitive meeting, at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Spain led by 14‚Äì2 at the start of the game. Argentina recovered to finish the first quarter with 14 points against Spain's 22. The lead then fluctuated, but once the Argentinians cut the deficit to twelve at the start of the third quarter, the Spaniards went on a 14‚Äì0 run, leading by 55‚Äì33. The Spaniards never looked back. Ricky Rubio scored 20 points in the game, and limited Facundo Campazzo to just 11 points in 20% field-goal percentage. Luis Scola was also limited to 1/10 shooting in the game, and didn't score until making his free-throws late in the third quarter, as Gabriel Deck had a game high 24 points. Marc Gasol scored 14 points, had a team high 7 assists, had 2 steals, and blocked 3 shots in the game. Argentina tried to mount a comeback in the fourth period, but by then the lead was too great, and there was little time remaining by then. Spain won its second World Cup, with Gasol and Fern√°ndez being also a part of the first title in 2006. { style=\\"width:100%;\\" - valign=top align=right width=33%  style=\\"vertical-align:top; align:center; width:33%;\\" { style=\\"width:100%;\\" -  style=\\"width=50%;\\"    style=\\"width=50%;\\"  } {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; margin:auto;\\" align=center - !

Having successfully attended high school at Colegio Nacional, he moved to Buenos Aires where he pursued a career in Law and met his future friend Lucio Vicente L√≥pez. It was at the University of Buenos Aires at age 27 that he obtained a JD in private law with a thesis named \\"Obligaciones y responsabilidades del iniquilino,\\" under the tutelage of Indalecio G√≥mez (co- author of 1912 S√°enz Pe√±a Law). Having returned to the province where he was born, Fr√≠as was appointed as a judge and became a pedagogue in parallel to his judicial career. His various teaching activities, directed toward teenagers as well as female teachers, provided him with a firm interest in the history of his province, which would later develop into his six-volume magnum opus Historia del General Mart√≠n Miguel de G√ºemes y de la Provincia de Salta o sea de la Independencia Argentina. Fr√≠as agreed with numerous historians that Mart√≠n G√ºemes was a key figure in the process of South American independence. In the specific field of historiography he advocated federalism as opposed to the works of Vicente Fidel L√≥pez. In 1902 Fr√≠as was elected as a representative for the Province Congress.Un salte√±o paradigm√°tico que devel√≥ la gesta emancipadora desde una mirada integral.\\", El Tribuno, Retrieved 02 July 2018 Finally he died in 1930 shortly after being designated as a Minister of the Corte de Justicia (Court of Justice).

Boystown was originally created by the archdiocese to help house minor refugees from Cuba. Eventually, the facility began to take in boys over 13 who needed a home. The shelter was meant to be temporary home and the average stay was around a year or so. Boystown included a swimming pool, animals for the children to interact with and sports facilities. Boys went to work and school in the community. Dorms in the form of air-conditioned cabins housed the boys. Two married couples and various counselors lived on the facility.

She was considered as one of the leading members of the Royal Swedish Ballet in the 1810s and 1820s. She became a student of the Royal Swedish Ballet in 1812, and a premier dancer (ballerina) from 1820 to 1830. Brunstr√∂m was described as a star member of the royal ballet during her career. Among her roles were Fanny in Den √§delmodige F√ºrsten by Giovanni Battista Ambrosiani, in the ballet to the opera Jessonda by Spohr, and as one of The Three Graces in the pantomime ballet K√§rleken och gracerna ('Love and the Graces') alongside Gustafva Calsenius and Charlotta Alm, with Sophie Daguin as Venus, Charlotte Lindmark as Amor, Per Erik Wallqvist as Apollo and Charles Holm as the shepherd. Privately, Carolina Brunstr√∂m had a long term relationship and several children with Gustaf Hans von Fersen (1802-1839), the son and heir of Fabian von Fersen (1762‚Äì1818), which is stated as the reason to why she chose to retire in 1830 in the midst of great success onstage. von Fersen, then the perhaps richest heir in Sweden, bought her a house and secured the financial future for her and her children and promised to marry her if she gave birth to a son, but when they had exclusively daughters, his mother convinced him to marry a noblewoman instead: he died officially childless.Svenska million√§rer. Minnen och anteckningar / 3 The chronicler and theater historian Nils Personne said of her: :\\"She was one of the acknowledged favorites of the public and much celebrated for her beauty as well as for her significant artistic ability, but in the middle of her triumphs, she chose to abandon the stage to devote her days to raise the children she had with the rich and elegant count Hans von F., owner of Ljung och Steninge.

She later became an international curator of Swedish arts, crafts and design. Career Caroline Hebbe, born February 3, 1930 in Uppsala, Sweden, daughter of Per Magnus Hebbe and Brita Hebbe (Benedicks), sister of Agneta Hebbe and half-sister of Marianne W√§ndell, had a brief career as a photographer; nevertheless, from 1949, she gained international attention for her ‚Äòsubjective‚Äô photography. After winning some contests she participated in Young Photographers II, where she exhibited nineteen photographs with a mixture of surrealistically inspired motifs, abstract compositions, portraits and documentary imagery, including a black-and-white composition entitled Venini, depicting wire mesh and a twig on an otherwise completely empty beach; an image of a haunting surrealist quality. The exhibition was the starting point for a heated debate in Sweden, as in the rest of Europe, around \\"the new image‚Äù. When an edited second edition of the exhibition toured New York and Paris in 1951, Caroline Hebbe was the remaining female participant. That year Hebbe married Hans Hammarski√∂ld (1925 ‚Äì 2012), one of the leading names in Swedish photography. In 1952 they undertook a month-long trip to New York to study the new American photography and to meet famous photographers, including Irving Penn, Edward Steichen and W. Eugene Smith. Steichen was the head of the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art. The short meeting led to a lifelong friendship. Both took portraits of Steichen, and Steichen eventually became godfather of the couple's first child, their daughter Suzanne Caroline Hammarskiold, born in 1955. Their other children were Viveca Madeleine Hammarskiold, born 1956 and Richard Hebbe-Hammarskiold (1961). Recognition From 1947, during Alfred Westholm‚Äôs directorship of the Gothenburg Art Museum the institution had started to collect work in a new category: art photography. Made by contemporary Swedish photographers the acquisitions were first shown in 1953 in the exhibition Swedish Photo Art 1948-1951. In the catalogue, twenty-four artists‚Äô works are illustrated, three of which were by women and one was Fish-net (1951) by Caroline Hebbe.

He was a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) researcher, Tsinghua University professor, and Founding Director of the Institute of Engineering Thermophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). He pioneered the general theory of three-dimensional flow for turbomachinery, which has been widely used in aircraft engine designs. Wu and his wife Li Minhua were both academicians of the CAS. Born in Shanghai, Wu's college education at Tsinghua University was interrupted by the Second Sino- Japanese War. He graduated from the temporary National Southwestern Associated University and was awarded a Boxer Indemnity Scholarship to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States. After earning his Ph.D., he joined the NACA, the predecessor of NASA, where he developed the theory of three-dimensional flow. After the outbreak of the Korean War, Wu and his wife returned to China in 1954. He established China's first turbomachinery program at Tsinghua and developed a nonorthogonal curvilinear coordinate system to improve computational accuracy. After suffering setbacks during the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, his research resumed in the 1970s. In 1980, he became the Founding Director of the Institute of Engineering Thermophysics of the CAS.  Early life and education  Wu was born on 27 July 1917 in Shanghai, with his ancestral home in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province. He attended Shanghai Gezhi High School until age 16, before moving to Nanjing and graduating from Jinling High School. In 1935, he entered the Department of Mechanics of Tsinghua University in Beiping (now Beijing). After the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, the university evacuated Beiping and moved south to Changsha, Hunan Province. Together with other students of Tsinghua's mechanics department, he received a year of military training at the newly established Army Mechanized Force School in Hunan. When the Imperial Japanese Army invaded Hunan, his university was forced to evacuate again to Kunming in southwest China, where Tsinghua and several other exiled universities combined their diminished resources to form the temporary National Southwestern Associated University (Lianda). Wu resumed his studies at Lianda, and was hired as a faculty member after graduating in 1940. In 1943, he married Li Minhua, a fellow alumna and physicist at Lianda.  Career in the United States  In late 1943, Wu won Tsinghua University's Boxer Indemnity Scholarship to study in the United States. He and his wife were both accepted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as Ph.D. students and began their studies in 1944. He specialized in the internal combustion engine. Li gave birth to two sons in the US, and the couple took turns taking classes and looking after the children. Wu earned his Ph.D. in 1947, and Li hers a year later. They both joined the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics after graduation. In 1950, he pioneered the three-dimensional flow theory, which was considered by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers as one of the two most important breakthroughs of the 1950s in the development of turbomachinery, together with the invention of computers. With the outbreak of the Korean War, Sino-American relations turned openly hostile, and Wu and Li decided they could no longer work for the US military. They resigned from NACA and became professors at Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1951. In 1954, they resolved to return to China. To avoid suspicion of the US government, the family flew to Britain in August for vacation, and travelled to China through Switzerland, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union, arriving at the end of the year.  Career in China  Statue of Wu Zhonghua at Jinling High School In Beijing, Wu was appointed professor and deputy head of the Mechanics Department of Tsinghua University, and established China's first turbomachinery program at Tsinghua in 1956. The following year, he established a research lab in turboengines and internal combustion at the Institute of Mechanics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). He was elected as an academician of the CAS in 1957. When the University of Science and Technology of China was established in 1958, he served as the head of the Department of Physics and Thermal Engineering. Because of his outspoken criticism of the Great Leap Forward, he was denounced in 1958 as a \\"right-leaning\\" academic. He was politically rehabilitated the following year and appointed Deputy Director of the Institute of Mechanics of the CAS in 1960. His research program was among the many cancelled during the Great Famine. In the ensuing Socialist Education Movement, he was sent to perform manual work in rural Hongtong County in Shanxi for three years. When the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, Wu was protected by Premier Zhou Enlai and PLA Air Force officers who valued his scientific contributions. He survived the turmoil unscathed, but his research was completely stopped until 1971, when the initial chaos of the revolution subsided. After the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976 and the normalization of Sino-American relations in 1979, Wu led a group of Chinese scientists to visit the United States for the first time since he returned to China in 1954. In 1980, the CAS established the Institute of Engineering Thermophysics (IET), with Wu as its founding director. Wu won the State Natural Science Award (Second Class) in 1957 and 1982. He was awarded the Major Discovery Prize by the CAS in 1975, and the Gold Award from the China Mechanical Engineering Association. From 1981 to 1992, he served as an executive chairman of the CAS. He was elected to the Standing Committee of the 6th and 7th National People's Congress, and served from 1983 until his death in 1992.  Scientific contributions  While working at NACA in 1950, Wu published the paper \\"A general theory of three-dimensional flow in subsonic and supersonic turbomachines of axial-, radial-, and mixed-flow types\\", which pioneered the three-dimensional flow theory. He reduced three-dimensional flow problems to problems of iterating two solutions of two independent variables. The relaxation or direct matrix method was used for subsonic flows and the method of characteristics for supersonic flows. In the 1960s, he developed a body-fitted, nonorthogonal curvilinear coordinate system to improve computational accuracy. At the Institute of Engineering Thermophysics, he and his colleagues developed shock-fitting and artificial compressibility methods for solutions in two- and three-dimensional transonic flows. Wu's theories have been widely used in the designs of aircraft engines, including the Teledyne CAE J69, Pratt & Whitney JT3D, Rolls-Royce Spey, Rolls-Royce RB211, Pratt & Whitney JT9D, and the General Electric F404.  Retirement and death  Wu retired in June 1987. He was diagnosed with liver cancer soon afterwards, and was successfully treated by Dr. Wu Mengchao in Shanghai. In 1990, Wu and Li were invited to teach at Clemson University for four months, and he gave a series of lectures at the NASA Lewis Research Center. In 1992, Wu's cancer relapsed and metastasized to his lungs. He was hospitalized in August, and died on 19 September 1992 in Beijing, at the age of 75. Soon after his death, NASA published Report 4496 (1993) on his general theory of turbomachinery. He had reviewed the final draft of the manuscript while in hospital. On his 90th birthday in 2007, the Institute of Engineering Thermophysics established the Wu Zhonghua Scholarship Fund in his memory, which rewards outstanding graduate students and researchers in engineering thermophysics.

The purpose of the fund is a platform for the people to help the country and to receive the people's donations to strengthen the government's finances. The establishment of the fund was made after seeing the willingness of the people to donate to the new government to settle the country's national debt amounting to more than RM1 trillion derived after taking over the previous Barisan Nasional (BN) administration led by Najib Razak on the 9 May 2018 general election. THM was supposed to be closed on 31 December 2018 but was finally extended to 14 January 2019 after Cabinet of Malaysia agreed to prolong the campaign for contributions for two more weeks. , THM has earned a sum of RM203,292,117.41 or about RM203.29 million, including interest received from fixed deposit investments amounted to RM575,342.31 up to 31 March. Minister of Finance Lim Guan Eng announced the whole funds will be used to settle a portion of 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) 2019 debt amounting to RM1.7bil. He also stressed while it may not be able to repay 1MDB's entire debt of RM51bil, the fund serves as a symbol of Malaysians' loyalty and patriotism, when it comes to helping to repay the country's debt. Lim had announced the last total collection of THM which stood at RM205,491,219, including interest was earned from the trust account where the donation was deposited, has been fully utilised to pay off the 1MDB debts on 30 November 2019. Issue The Malaysian opposition leader and former Deputy Prime Minister of BN, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi accuses the government of taking a populist approach by launching THM. He slammed the PH government‚Äôs decision to launch THM, by saying that the government should not burden the people to donate funds in order to help it meet its debt obligations.

Bank robbery At the age of 17, Wiggins, along with her two co-defendants Foster Tarver, age 17, and Samuel Barlow, age 18, planned to rob the Dauphin Deposit Bank in Dauphin, Pennsylvania on December 2, 1968. Barlow was in the stolen get-away car; armed, Wiggins and Foster entered the bank. Wiggins was positioned at the front door hidden behind a tall plant while Tarver went deeper into the bank. George Morelock, a customer, entered the bank unaware that a robbery had commenced. Morelock wrestled with Wiggins to stop the robbery and her gun went off twice. Tarver ran over and shot Morelock again. Wiggins and Tarver fled the bank, got into the car, and were quickly apprehended when Barlow lost control of the car while police fired.  Sentencing and incarceration  In 1969 Wiggins, Tarver, and Barlow were sentenced to death. In 1971 all three had their sentences commuted to life without the possibility of parole. At that time in 1969, there were no women at SCI Muncy serving a death sentence, and so Wiggins was confined to the restricted housing unit, the Clinton Building, behind the main property. SCI Muncy had no fence or wall securing the facility until 1985; as a result, many women walked away. Muncy had the highest rate of all Pennsylvania state prisons for escapes prior to the wall and fence being erected. Wiggins walked away twice during her first ten years of her life sentence. In 1973 while attending Williamsport Community College, she walked away. While on escape status for about 30 days, she turned herself in to authorities. In 1975 she walked away from the institution and was on escape status for three years. In 1983, Wiggins filed a class action lawsuit with other female prisoners at Muncy, which led to the opening of a law clinic at the facility as well as other reforms. In addition to the lack of law clinic (a standard resource at men's prisons), the suit also alleged that Muncy's vocational, educational, medical, rehabilitative, and psychological services were inferior, and that the prison was unsafe, due to fire hazards and asbestos. A prison counselor, Nancy Sponeybarger, later described Wiggins's positive contributions to the incarcerated community as a peer counselor, tutor, and mediator. Sponeybarger continued to visit Wiggins even after leaving her job at Muncy. Wiggins was the first graduate of Penn State University's continuing education program at SCI Muncy. Later she worked for PSU as an administrator and student liaison for the Muncy program. The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections allowed this arrangement since Wiggins agreed to pay for her \\"room and board\\" expenses from her salary while serving her life sentence. It is believed that she is the only prisoner in the US to be afforded this opportunity under those conditions. In 2009 the Pennsylvania Prison Society named Wiggins Prisoner of the Year, \\"in recognition of her constant efforts to improve the world around her, of the hope which she ignites in others and the positive and effective leadership she provides.\\" Wiggins applied for commutation 13 times; the last application was filed shortly before her death. Her co-defendant Tarver was paroled in June 2018. Barlow was granted clemency in March 2019.  Death and legacy  Wiggins died of heart problems on March 24, 2013, at the age of 62 in her Bethune Unit cell at the State Correctional Institution at Muncy in Pennsylvania. She is buried at Gethsemane Cemetery in Detroit, Michigan. Wiggins is survived by her mother Estella, sisters Angela and Nicole and brother Frank. She is predeceased by her father, brother Michael and sister Pandora. A memorial and tribute was held for her in Philadelphia, PA, in June 2013, hosted by The Pennsylvania Coalition for The Fair Sentencing of Youth and organized by attorney Emily Keller of the Juvenile Law Center and Ellen Melchiondo, an official visitor with the Pennsylvania Prison Society. After Wiggins' death, Melchiondo donated a collection of biographical material, correspondence, interviews, and writings from incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women about Wiggins. In 2015, The Sharon Peachie Wiggins Biographical Materials archive was established at Penn State University, in University Park, PA.

She has led pioneering research in atom optics, laser micro-manipulation using optical tweezers, laser enhanced ionisation spectroscopy, biophysics and quantum physics.  Early life  Halina Rubinsztein (later Rubinsztein-Dunlop) was born in Poland. She emigrated to Sweden where she obtained her BSc and PhD degree from the University of Gothenburg. Rubinsztein-Dunlop was encouraged to be curious about the world by her mother, also a physicist. In an interview for SPIE, she credits her mother's guidance and enthusiasm for science: \\"she taught me to persist and to be inquisitive and to want to understand, and also - and I think this is what was important - she showed me that women can do it. It was infectious,\\" She moved to Australia in 1989, shortly after her marriage to engineer Gordon Dunlop.  Career  Rubinsztein-Dunlop completed her PhD titled Atomic-beam magnetic resonance investigations of refractory elements and metastable states of lead at the University of Gothenburg in 1978. After moving to Australia in 1989, Rubinsztein-Dunlop joined the Department of Physics at the University of Queensland where she formed a research group studying laser physics. In 1995, she helped establish a Science in Action program that was used for outreach in educational programs for schools. Rubinsztein-Dunlop was appointed Professor of physics in 2000. She held the role of head of the department of physics as well as the head of the School of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Queensland from 2006‚Äì2013. She is the Director of the Quantum Science Laboratory and leads one of the scientific programs of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Engineered Quantum Systems. In 2011 she was a guest editor for the Journal of Optics on a special issue about optical tweezers, published by the Institute of Physics. In 2016 Rubinsztein-Dunlop was made Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in the Queen's 2018 Birthday Honours List for \\"distinguished service to laser physics and nano-optics as a researcher, mentor and academic, to the promotion of educational programs, and to women in science\\". During the 2018 international scientific conference SPIE, the Optical Trapping and Optical Micromanipulation XV programme held a special session honouring Halina Rubinsztein-Dunlop. An Australian Museum Eureka Prize was awarded to the University of Queensland Optical Physics in Neuroscience team, consisting of Rubinsztein-Dunlop alongside Ethan Scott and Itia Favre-Bulle for their study of the brain and how it detects gravity and motion. The full title of the award is the 2018 UNSW Eureka Prize for Excellence in Interdisciplinary Scientific Research.  Research  Rubinsztein-Dunlop conducts research that harnesses the power of optics and lasers to explore quantum and biological phenomena. She has published over 200 works in journals and books and has also been featured on radio and television. Rubinsztein-Dunlop is considered an originator of laser enhanced ionisation spectroscopy.  Quantum Optics  Although her PhD involved looking at the hyperfine structure of atoms, she notes that her research was \\"not [using] the tiniest of the tiniest...I never worked with quarks or gluons...\\". She was however, fascinated by being able to interrogate nature at small level using light. Her team successfully demonstrated dynamical tunnelling in a Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC) using a modulated standing wave. Rubinzstein-Dunlop's team has also observed dynamical tunnelling in quantum chaotic systems. In 2016, Rubinsztein-Dunlop, along with Tyler Neely and Guillaume Gauthier, imprinted images of Einstein and Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose on a super-cold microscopic fluid, demonstrating a physics state predicted by Einstein and Bose in 1925 but first achieved in 1995. The image is approximately 0.1mm by 0.1mm in size but with a surface 100 million times colder than interstellar space.  Optical Micro-manipulation  Rubinsztein-Dunlop's research in laser micro-manipulation involves the use of optical tweezers to trap objects in three dimensions and exert optical forces onto them. As she explains in her own words, \\"Optical tweezers act like our normal tweezers, but instead of using mechanical tweezers you are just using laser light that's highly focused: you grab something, and apply force to it to move it. What is beautiful about it is that it's a quantitative method: you can evaluate how far you move an entity and what sort of force you're applying, so you can start interrogating complex biological or solid state systems in a very precise way.\\" Her group exploits the ability to rotate very small objects using exotic laser modes such as Laguerre Gauss beams, as for example was published in 2014 for a micron size donut shaped rotor. In a seminal paper published in 1995 and titled \\"Direct Observation of Transfer of Angular Momentum to Absorptive Particles from a Laser Beam with a Phase Singularity\\", Rubinsztein-Dunlop's group experimentally showed the spinning of absorptive particles trapped in a singularity beam where the spin direction was controlled based on the sign of the singularity.  Biophysics  Rubinsztein-Dunlop also conducts work in the field of biophysics, notably a study on vertigo and understanding the body's balance system. At the heart of this research is otoliths which are little stones in the ears. By manipulating the otoliths in zebrafish and moving them around, reactions were observed such as how the \\"fish moves its tail to try to compensate for the interaction with its balance system\\". The 2018 UNSW Eureka Prize for Excellence in Interdisciplinary Scientific Research was awarded to Rubinsztein-Dunlop and the University of Queensland Optical Physics in Neuroscience team based on research using optical trapping and novel microscopes that image how brain circuits function to process motion together with other senses. She has also conducted research using laser micro-manipulation to examine red blood cells to see how long blood can be stored before being used safely; the older the cell, the more likely the elasticity changes. Rubinsztein-Dunlop uses optical tweezers to grab the blood cell at both ends and then stretches the cell from one end whilst the other is fixed to measure how much it can stretch.

The resulting treaty was signed on 1 April. By its terms, Spain would return to Moroccan control the southern zone of its protectorate, which it had retained even after handing over the northern zone in 1956. This zone, called Cabo Juby or the Tarfaya Strip, lay between the river Draa and the parallel 27¬∞ 40‚Ä≤ north. The transfer was to take place on 10 April in the administrative capital of Villa Bens (Tarfaya). The Moroccan heir apparent, the future Hassan II, was present at the ceremony.Carlos Canales Torres and Miguel del Rey Vicente, Breve historia de la Guerra de Ifni-S√°hara (Madrid: Nowtilus, 2010), p. 251. The agreement did not give a timeline for the evacuation of Spanish troops from either the northern or southern zone of the old protectorate, but merely expressed both parties' commitment to total evacuation. On 15 April, Spain circulated a note verbale to the United Nations asserting that with the Treaty of Angra de Cintra it had completely fulfilled its declaration of 7 April 1956 terminating its protectorate.Julio D.

On 30 June 1958, the Moroccan Army of Liberation (which was not a part of the regular Moroccan army) declared a ceasefire, bringing to an end the Ifni War. The enclave of Sidi Ifni, which was surrounded by Moroccan territory, was not ceded at Angra de Cintra, since it was under Spanish sovereignty. It was, however, greatly reduced in size, since its outlying regions, occupied by the Ait Ba Amran tribe were abandoned (although this was not specified in the treaty).Ren√© P√©lissier, \\"Spain's Discreet Decolonization\\", Foreign Affairs 43, 3 (1965), p. 523.

The battle began on December 7, 1855 and ended on December 11th, 1855. The battle was fought between six companies of the Oregon Mounted Volunteers and the Walla Walla. Fighting alongside the Walla Walla were members of several different tribes, such as the Cayuse, Palouse and Yakama. Background Following a Walla Walla raid on the Fort Walla Walla trading post and reports that Chief Peopeomoxmox had vowed to kill Washington Territory Governor Isaac Stevens, troops from the Oregon Mounted Volunteers were dispatched to the Umatilla River and later to the Touchet River. The Chief and four others met the troops at the Touchet and, willingly, became their hostage in order to prevent an attack on his village. The volunteers and the five hostages began to march down the Touchet in order to establish a winter camp. Battle As the soldiers marched towards the former Whitman Mission, they realized that they were being pursued by a large group of Native warriors. Soon, a running battle began at the mouth of the Touchet. On the first day, four of the five hostages, including the chief, were killed by volunteers in a struggle to escape their captors. On the fourth and final day of the battle, Both the Natives and the Volunteers withdrew, the Volunteers to Fort Henrietta on the Umatilla. Aftermath The battle resulted in the death of Walla Walla tribe leader, Peo-Peo-Mox-Mox along with the deaths of six volunteers and between 75 and 100 Natives. The total Native casualties are unknown due to bodies being taken from the battlefield, but volunteers did find 39 bodies following the battle.

Cagle was born in Cedartown, Georgia, the son of Jesse Martin Cagle and Samaria Duke, and grew up in Cullman County, Alabama. There he took lessons with S. M. Denson; at the same time he worked on the farm belonging to Denson's brother T.J., with whom he also studied music. It was to the latter that he showed his first compositions, the tunes \\"New Hope\\" and \\"Present Joys\\", which were published in the Union Harp of 1909 and the Original Sacred Harp of 1911. As an adult Cagle lived in Cullman and Birmingham, Alabama, prior to moving to Atlanta. Professionally he was employed as a bookkeeper, bank employee, and traveling salesman. At his retirement he moved to Villa Rica, Georgia. Called \\"the territory‚Äôs preeminent singer, leader, and keyer of music\\", he would return to Cullman regularly for sings even after having moved from the area in 1937. Cagle possessed a bass voice, and was known for his skill as a composer of shape note hymns. Of these, two, \\"Sacred Mount\\" and \\"Soar Away\\", first appeared in the 1936 Denison Revision of the Original Sacred Harp. He also keyed many performances, and may be heard in this role on a recording of the 1959 United Convention which took place in Fyffe, Alabama. For the 1960 revision he chaired the music committee; he was also a member of the music committee for the revision of 1966. He remained active in the Sacred Harp movement until his death, discussing matters of tempo and pitching in performance with various writers. He instructed other musicians as well, including Hugh McGraw. An obituary appeared in the introduction to the 1971 Denison revision. Described as possessing \\"a handsome figure and dynamic (and volatile) personality\\", Cagle was married three times. His first wife was Maggie Frances Denson, daughter of T. J. and his wife Amanda; the couple had three children before their divorce. His second wife was Lena Rose Drake, daughter of L. B. Drake of Coweta County, Georgia. After her death, which occurred around 1959, he married Inez Lee. Cagle was also, briefly, the brother-in-law of T. J. Denson, who married his elder sister, Lille Florida Cagle, in September 1910, a union which was quickly dissolved. His cousin Ida was the wife of Sacred Harp composer Lee Andrew McGraw. Cagle is buried in Villa Rica, in Hillcrest Cemetery.

The church was first built in 1716. In 1745, the Cruciferous Fathers of Good Death took control over the church until 1826 and made many changes, along with architectural improvements.  History  Before the church was built, an orchard of orange trees was located on the premises. On January 20, 1711, a priest was introduced to the priest of the Tabernacle, located on the left side of the Cathedral of Lima. This priest asked the priest of the Tabernacle to allow him to seek his certificate of baptism in the parish books. The presbyter agreed. Later, the golden ciborium containing the consecrated hosts for the various churches of Lima had disappeared. No one noticed the disappearance until January 30 when the per diem was required for a priest to administer to a dying man. The absence of the ciborium caused that an armed population to revolt. The ecclesiastical authorities decide to close all the temples of the capital and suspend the administration of the Eucharist. Lima was left without Masses and without the sacrament of communion. The thief, Fernando Hurtado de Ch√°vez, was captured after he attempted to sell the stones that adorned the ciborium to pulpero don Jaime Alv√≠tez. Ch√°vez confessed that the relic was buried and wrapped in a paper next to an orange tree in one of the bushes near the Alameda de los Descalzos. The Iglesia de Santa Liberata was built in this spot two years later. The main altar is located above the hole where the hosts were found. The religious building was named Santa Liberata, for being the patron of the native town of the viceroy, the Spanish city of Sig√ºenza.

Report Background Michigan International Speedway Michigan International Speedway (MIS) is a moderate- banked D-shaped speedway located off U.S. Highway 12 on more than approximately south of the village of Brooklyn, in the scenic Irish Hills area of southeastern Michigan. The track is used primarily for NASCAR events. It is sometimes known as a \\"sister track\\" to Texas World Speedway, and was used as the basis of Auto Club Speedway. The track is owned by International Speedway Corporation (ISC). Michigan International Speedway is recognized as one of motorsports' premier facilities because of its wide racing surface and high banking (by open-wheel standards; the 18-degree banking is modest by stock car standards). Michigan is the fastest track in NASCAR due to its wide, sweeping corners and long straightaways; typical qualifying speeds are in excess of and corner entry speeds are anywhere from after the 2012 repaving of the track. =Entry list= {  style=\\"font-size:95%\\" - ! !

In 2018, he played a leading role in the Tham Luang cave rescue. He cave dives as a hobby and conducts rescues as a volunteer. He works as an IT consultant in Bristol. Early life and education Volanthen was born in June 1971, and grew up in Brighton, England. Volanthen's surname is an anglicised spelling of the Swiss surname \\"Von Lanthen\\" ‚Äî his grandfather was Swiss. He attended Longhill High School in Rottingdean, and later De Montfort University in Leicester where he studied electronics. Caving and rescues Early interest Volanthen's interest in caving began when he was a scout. He began cave diving through a social club when he attended college. Rescues Volanthen frequently cave dives and conducts rescues with a partner, Richard Stanton. He was part of a team that attempted a cave rescue of Eric Establie in 2010, in the Dragonni√®re Gaud Cave near Labastide-de-Virac in the Ard√®che region of France, which was ultimately unsuccessful. In 2011, Volanthen assisted in the recovery of the body of Polish cave diver Artur Koz≈Çowski from a cave in Kiltartan, Ireland. Norwegian authorities asked him to assist in recovering the bodies of two Finnish divers from Jordbrugrotta in 2014, but after diving down to the site he and his colleagues assessed the operation to be too risky. The bodies were subsequently recovered by Finnish and Norwegian divers. In 2018, he helped locate a youth soccer team in the Tham Luang cave rescue; he and Stanton were the first to make contact with them. Poor visibility, cave and rescue debris, and low temperatures were all obstacles to cave diving in search of the team. Volanthen was placing guidelines in the cave to assist others in navigation. He ran out of line, which led him to swim to the surface‚Äîthere he found the missing team and the adult coach. Volanthen's voice is that heard on a widely broadcast video of the first contact with the soccer team, saying \\"How many of you?\\" When he learned that all the missing people were accounted for, he replied, \\"Brilliant.\\" He and Stanton did not have any food to offer the team when they encountered them, but they gave them a light. When they left the team, Volanthen promised them that he would come back, doing so by assisting in delivering food. Volanthen discounted the notion that encountering the team was due to luck, saying that he and Stanton systematically surfaced at every airspace in the flooded cave passages to shout and listen for a response, as well as to smell. He stated that they smelled the team before they saw them. Volanthen also assisted in rescuing members of the team, saying that the children were enclosed in bags with handles on the backs for the divers to hold onto, and clipped to the divers in case they lost their grip. Parts of the cave were so narrow that the children had to be pushed in front of the divers. At other times, the children were held close to the chest or out to the side. Volanthen said that the children were held as if carrying a \\"shopping bag.\\" In a BBC interview after the rescue, Volanthen was asked, \\"Can you see that what you did was fairly remarkable?\\" He responded, \\"I can see it was a first, how's that?\\" Records In 2004, Volanthen and Stanton set a world record for the greatest depth achieved in a British cave, cave diving at Wookey Hole in Somerset. In 2010, Volanthen, Stanton, Jason Mallinson, and Ren√© Houben set a world record for the longest cave penetration dive, reaching in the Pozo Azul cave system in the Rudr√≥n Valley in Spain. Equipment Volanthen designs and constructs some of his own diving equipment, and has been called a \\"technical guru.\\" He designed a mapping device that collects information while diving. He also designs and modifies his own rebreathers to increase their compactness and efficiency. Awards and honours Volanthen was awarded the Royal Humane Society's bronze medal in 2012 for a rescue attempt of a diver in a French cave, and for the discovery of the diver's body. In September 2018, he was given the Bronze Cross, The Scout Association's highest honour, awarded for \\"heroism or action in the face of extraordinary risk.\\" In November 2018, Volanthen and five other members of the British cave rescue team were given the Pride of Britain 2018 award for \\"Outstanding Bravery\\" for the Tham Luang incident. The rescued children attended the award ceremony, in London. In the 2019 New Year Honours, Volanthen and Stanton were awarded the George Medal (GM) for their roles at Tham Luang. Three other members of their team were made Members of the Order of the British Empire and two were awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal. Personal life As a hobby, Volanthen runs marathons and ultramarathons. He is also a volunteer scout leader with the Somerset Scouts, taking children on cave excursions. He was formerly married to Annabelle Richards.

He has been called \\"one of the world's most accomplished cave-divers\\", \\"the face of British cave diving,\\" and \\"the best cave diver in Europe\\". Stanton has lived in Coventry for many years, and was formerly a firefighter with the West Midlands Fire Service for 25 years prior to his retirement. In 2018 he played a leading role in the Tham Luang cave rescue and was awarded the George Medal in the Civilian Gallantry List. Early life Stanton was born in 1961 and grew up in Epping Forest District in Essex. He attributes his interest in cave diving to a television programme he watched as a teenager, The Underground Eiger, saying, \\"After watching it, I just knew that cave-diving was for me.\\" Stanton studied at Aston University, where he joined both the caving and the diving clubs. He began as a self-taught diver in the River Lune in Cumbria and Lancashire. Stanton has lived in Coventry for many years, and was formerly a firefighter with the West Midlands Fire Service for 25 years prior to his retirement. Caving and rescues Rescues Stanton usually cave dives and conducts rescues with a partner, John Volanthen. In 2004 he was involved in the rescue of six British cavers who were trapped in a cave at the Alpazat caverns in Mexico for eight days. Stanton was also part of a team that attempted a cave rescue of Eric Establie, in the Dragonni√®re Gaud Cave near Labastide-de-Virac in the Ard√®che region of France, in 2010 which was ultimately unsuccessful. In 2011, Stanton assisted in the recovery of the body of Polish cave diver Artur Koz≈Çowski from Pollonora cave at Kiltartan, Ireland. Norwegian authorities asked him to assist to recover the bodies of two Finnish divers from Jordbrugrotta in 2014, but after diving down to the site he and his colleagues deemed the operation too risky. He had completed another recovery there in 2006. In 2018, he helped locate a youth soccer team in the Tham Luang cave rescue. After locating and participating in the rescue of the missing team and its coach, Stanton said that he and the other cave divers involved were not heroes, saying, \\"We‚Äôre just using a very unique skill set, which we normally use for our own interest and sometimes we‚Äôre able to use that to give something back to the community.\\" Records In 2004 Stanton and Volanthen set a world record for greatest depth achieved in a British cave, cave diving at Wookey Hole in Somerset. In 2010 Stanton, Volanthen, Jason Mallinson, and Ren√© Houben set a world record for longest cave penetration dive, obtaining in the Pozo Azul cave system in the Rudr√≥n Valley in Spain. Equipment Stanton is a technical diver, developing his own diving gear to great effect. He developed two closed-circuit rebreather units; this novel technology has been \\"instrumental in his achieving cave diving depth records around the world.\\" One modification was to allow the rebreather to be worn on the side of the body rather than the chest or back. This is advantageous in fitting through smaller spaces. He builds prototypes of his designs and tests them in swimming pools before using them in caves. He also uses underwater scooters to dive more efficiently, traveling greater distances while conserving energy and oxygen supplies. Awards and honours Stanton has been called \\"one of the world's most accomplished cave-divers\\", \\"the face of British cave diving,\\" and \\"the best cave diver in Europe\\". In 2008 Stanton received the EUROTEK \\"Diver of the Conference Award\\" for his \\"significant contribution to advanced and technical diving.\\" Stanton's rescue attempt of a diver in a French cave, and assistance in identifying the location of that diver's body, earned him the Royal Humane Society's bronze medal in 2012. Stanton also received the 'Hero of the Year' award at the West Midland Fire Service's Aspire Awards. Stanton was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours, \\"For services to Local Government\\". In November 2018, Stanton and five other members of the British cave rescue team were given the 2018 Pride of Britain Award for \\"Outstanding Bravery\\" for the Tham Luang incident.

I wasn't hurt so I rented a box truck and packed up all our broken instruments and drove them from D.C. to Providence. That night I was reading Kay Larsen's biography of John Cage, Where the Heart Beats, and came across the Salt Doll fable. I have found several versions of the Salt Doll story, but all basically tell the story of a doll that wants to know the ocean. The ocean says 'come in.' It puts its toe in, and knows something, but loses its toe. Puts its foot in, knows more, but loses its foot... and so on.

He would have to be somebody. Doubtless the young man may be the son of some substantial man which is a great thing and in this regard I would rather hear that you had gone to Africa and was happy and comfortable than see you come back here and take up with some ordinary ‚Äúsnipe‚Äù and climb six pair of stairs and occupy two rooms back with a full view of 10 feet of a back yard and never a blessed day to yourself but drudgery and scraping and washing and worrying and wondering where the rent was to come from -- O! I could lecture all night on this subject and fill pages with illustrations, but your own imagination is sufficient. There can be no harm in asking you who was the noblest lady ever sat on the throne of England? It was Elizabeth Tudor! Why ‚Äì because husbandry had no attraction for her. Who was the most disturbing woman that ever had any authority in the British Isles? It was Mary Stuart ‚Äì Why ‚Äì because her fondness for husbandry. Who is the finest lady in this city to-day, honored by everybody and blessed by thousands? Mrs. Asterbilt! No ‚Äì Mrs. Croker ‚Äì not at all ‚Äì It is Helen Gould ‚Äì Why ‚Äì because she keeps aloof from husbandry. Who is the finest lady in this spot? I mean outside the Kennedy family ‚Äì It is Miss Emma Shay! Why ‚Äì because husbandry has no attraction for her. How serene she is! and how beautiful! And how rosy youth walks with her and dwells around her, and when Loretta with a wheelbarrowful of children comes you would not think they were sisters ‚Äì why? ‚Äì because husbandry has set its foot upon her and she is withering away! Who is the finest lady in the Lady Macduff Circle? Outside the Kennedy family ‚Äì It is Aunt Mary ‚Äì Why? ‚Äì Because she steers clear of husbandry and her light-heart and merry laugh abide with her forever!

From 1965‚Äì1988, members of the Army Band were posted on a two-year cycle with the Band of the 1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment, based originally at Terendak Camp in Malaysia. These biannual postings continued until December 1988, when the regimental band was disestablished and members returned to the New Zealand Army Band. In 2012, it was one of three bands spared in the government cutback on military bands. Marching displays Noted military tattoos has had the band travelling to Bremen, Germany; Basel, Switzerland; Nanchang, China; Wonju, South Korea and Edinburgh, Scotland. During its visit to Scotland in 2018 for the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, the band was presented with the Pooley Sword after it was considered to be the greatest act of that year's show by other bands and the audience. The band's first performance was a concert in Auckland in 1964. The Army Band celebrated its 20th anniversary in 1984 with an American-style Big Band march down of Queen Street. In August 1979, the band performed at the wedding services for their director Roger C. Carter. The drum major of the band uses a tewhatewha, a long-handled MƒÅori club weapon in the shape of an axe, instead of a mace to give direction and keep time. More recently, a Haka display group was attached to the band. Small ensembles *The Swing Band *Dance Band *Jazz Combo *Brass Quintet *The Bavarian Band  Quick marches  {  - ! Title !!

She was the spouse of Rafael Moreno Valle Rosas, who was governor of Puebla from 2011 to 2017 and was also killed in the crash. Life Born on 17 December 1973, Martha √ârika Alonso Hidalgo attended the Universidad Iberoamericana Puebla, where she studied graphic design, and the Universidad de las Am√©ricas Puebla, from which she graduated with a master's degree in public communication. She married Moreno Valle in 2004. In 2009, she became an active member of the PAN, and from 2011 to 2016, coinciding with most of her husband's tenure as governor, she presided over the foundation for the Puebla State DIF System. The DIF received more money during Alonso's leadership than it had in the preceding two state governments. In 2015, she became the state party's secretary general, holding its second-ranking position. Her education and professional experience lent her additional respect, leading to her being recognized as one of the most powerful first ladies in Puebla history. Gubernatorial candidacy In 2018, Alonso ran for Governor of Puebla‚Äîher first campaign for elected office‚Äîbacked by the Por Puebla al Frente coalition, which included the PAN, Party of the Democratic Revolution, Movimiento Ciudadano, and two state parties (Compromiso por Puebla and Pacto Social de Integraci√≥n). The PAN and the state parties had supported Moreno Valle's 2011 gubernatorial bid. She allegedly was picked for the nomination because PAN internal polling showed her as being a stronger candidate than the mayor of Puebla, Eduardo Rivera P√©rez. During the campaign, Alonso sought to distance herself from her husband, who did not appear at promotional events; she also did not use her husband's last name (Martha √ârika Alonso de Moreno Valle), as she had while running the Puebla DIF. However, several staffers from Moreno Valle's campaign and government joined Alonso's team, including the former state press secretary and former state legislators, and state political experts pointed out her use of similar strategies to Moreno Valle's campaign. Alonso won the election, defeating Miguel Barbosa Huerta on the Juntos Haremos Historia coalition ticket and two other candidates, on 1 July 2018, as first female governor of Puebla and the seventh nationwide. Death On 24 December 2018, a helicopter carrying Alonso, Rafael Moreno Valle and other PAN politicians from the state crashed in a field near the town of Santa Mar√≠a Coronango, half an hour from the city of Puebla, killing all. In a tweet, President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador indicated that Alonso and Moreno Valle were on the downed aircraft; she had been governor for ten days. A 27 March 2020 report by Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) concluded that the helicopter ‚Äúshould not have flown‚Äù because of a preexisting problem with a stability system on the helicopter that both the operator and the maintenance crew knew about.

It is written by Mohsin Ali, produced by Fahad Mustafa, Dr.Ali Kazmi and directed by Badar Mehmood. In this serial Sami Khan has played a lead role which was based on a love story with Sonya Hussain and Nadia Khan. Aisi Hai Tanhai talks about how social media can become a curse for some one's life and destroy everything. Plot Pakeeza Islam (Sonya Hussain) is a college student who lives with her single mother Khadija (Saba Hameed) and older sister Kinza (Nadia Khan). She falls in love with her classmate Hamza (Sami Khan) and soon they are engaged. Meanwhile, Kinza is married into a respectable family. One day, Hamza challenges Pakeeza to prove the love and trust she has for him. She takes revealing pictures on her phone and the next day offers for Hamza to take a look. He feels ashamed and denies the offer. Immediately afterward, goons forcefully steal Pakeeza's phone and shoot her in the process. Hamza rushes her to the hospital, where she recovers fully but expresses concern over the contents of her phone. The goons leak Pakeeza's photos all over social media, where they go viral. Hamza's friends hold him responsible for this and Hamza goes to lengths to ensure that Pakeeza's family remains oblivious. His close friend Ramsha (Sadia Ghafar) is in love with him and feels jealous of his relationship with Pakeeza. To sabotage their engagement, she forwards Pakeeza's photos to Hamza's mother. This causes Hamza's parents to break off their son's engagement. Pakeeza's family learns the truth about her viral photos when Kinza's husband divorces her. In retaliation, Khadija feeds her poison. As Pakeeza is admitted to the hospital in critical condition, Khadija leaves and informs everyone that Pakeeza committed suicide. This devastates Kinza and Hamza, while Ramsha feels guilty for her sabotage. Pakeeza is shifted to another ward in the meantime, where Dr. Saad (Kamran Jilani) takes interest in her case and takes it upon himself to try and heal her. When Khadija returns to the hospital, she is told that there is a deceased patient in the ward Pakeeza had been in, causing her to believe that Pakeeza is dead. While she is in a coma, Pakeeza is raped by a hospital custodian and this goes unnoticed by the rest of the staff. She eventually awakens, much to Dr. Saad's delight, and begins to recover slowly. In the meantime, Hamza marries Kinza as he feels responsible for ruining Pakeeza and her family's reputation. Dr. Saad offers Pakeeza shelter in his home after she is discharged and learns that she is pregnant. The hospital custodian is arrested, while Pakeeza is distraught over the trauma she has faced. Dr. Saad begins to receive threats for helping her and to protect him, she leaves to stay in a women's shelter. There she is shunned once it is discovered that she is pregnant. Now homeless, Pakeeza travels to a local shrine and suffers a bad fall. Ramsha, who had been volunteering at the shrine, sees this and is shocked to know that Pakeeza is alive. She takes her to a hospital, where Pakeeza is told that she has had a miscarriage. While Ramsha takes care of Pakeeza at her own home, Dr. Saad works hard to take the custodian to court. He urges Pakeeza to provide testimony so that justice can be served. Khadija receives a notice to appear in court, where she is shocked to find Pakeeza alive. Kinza and Hamza are also surprised to learn of Pakeeza's rape case. During the trial, the prosecutor questions Pakeeza's character and discusses her leaked photos. After Khadija and Ramsha admit their wrongdoings in court, this further traumatizes Pakeeza. She confronts her mother and Hamza, questioning their actions. Khadija passes away the next morning after wallowing in guilt. Soon after this, Hamza is shot and dies in the hospital as Pakeeza weeps beside him. The court finds the custodian guilty after he confesses his crime and is sentenced to jail. Pakeeza forgives Ramsha and moves in with her. She opens up a self-defense school for young girls, promising to fight for their rights.

He was Chief Judge in Equity from 1925 to 1935 and Acting Chief Justice from 1933 to 1934, as well as chairing multiple New South Wales royal commissions. Early life and family Harvey was born in Hampstead, London, England, the sixth of eight children born to Frances Harriet (n√©e Brewster) and Charles Musgrave Harvey. His father and grandfather were Anglican priests, and his older brother Richard served as Archdeacon of Halifax. His younger brother Sir Ernest Musgrave Harvey was Chief Cashier of the Bank of England and the first of the Harvey baronets. Harvey was educated at Marlborough College from 1878 to 1884 on a scholarship. He was a prefect and member of the rugby team. He subsequently won a scholarship to Keble College, Oxford, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1888. Harvey arrived in Australia in 1889, where he had found a position as tutor to the children of a Sydney lawyer. He subsequently developed an interest in the law himself, and was mentored by Langer Owen. Legal career From 1890 to 1893, Harvey was an associate to William Owen, the Chief Judge in Equity on the Supreme Court of New South Wales. He was called to the bar in March 1892, and developed a speciality in equity. He authored a number of important texts on the subject, including Service of Equitable Process (1898) and The Practice in Equity (1902; co- authored with George Rich). He was also a reporter for the New South Wales Law Reports and the New South Wales Weekly Notes. Judicial career Although still considered a \\"junior barrister\\", Harvey was appointed to the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 15 April 1913. He replaced George Rich, who had been elevated to the High Court. He was made a judge in the probate division in 1918, and Chief Judge in Equity in 1925. In June 1933, Chief Justice Philip Street took a leave of absence pending his official retirement in January 1934. In Street's absence, Harvey was the most senior judge on the bench and thus became Acting Chief Justice. He was suffered from failing eyesight by that time, however, and formally retired in January 1936 after a year of leave. In 1918, Harvey chaired a state Royal Commission into the law of property, with the aim of simplifying the practice of conveyancing. Many of his recommendations were incorporated into the Conveyancing Act 1919, which remains in effect. In the same year, Harvey also conducted an inquiry for the federal government under the terms of the War Precautions Act 1914. He was tasked with investigating whether the military detention of seven members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood at Darlinghurst Gaol was justified; his report concluded that they should continue to be imprisoned. He was also an official visitor to prisoner-of-war camps during World War I. Harvey conducted two further Royal Commissions for the state government during the 1920s. The first was a 1927 inquiry into the administration of the Child Welfare Department, while the second was a 1928 inquiry into the Sydney City Council's contract with Babcock and Wilcox Ltd. for the construction of the Bunnerong Power Station. In the latter, he found that a bribe had to the acting general manager of the Electricity Department, but that the company's tender should nonetheless still be accepted as it was the best bid available. Personal life Harvey married Beatrice Ward on 4 January 1895. The couple had one son and three daughters together. He was a warden of Saint Mark's Anglican Church, Darling Point, for 28 years, and from 1934 to 1938 was chancellor of the Anglican Diocese of Sydney. He was also the foundation chairman of Cranbrook School from 1918 to 1938; one of the school's houses is named in his honour. Harvey died at his home in Double Bay on 13 June 1940, at the age of 74. His estate was valued at ¬£22,225.

The main block is clad in clapboard, with a wide frieze-board and brackets supporting the eaves. Above is a hipped roof with a central deck. A 3-story bay on the west side rises to a tower with a mansard roof. The front porch spans the most of the north side, decorated with spindlework and an elaborate cut-out frieze. Rinde house (Queen Anne-style) * The Rinde house at 201 S. Franklin Street is a 2-story frame Queen Anne-styled house built in 1904. Typical of the style, it is asymmetric with wood shingles cut to give a different texture in the gables, and has a complex roof. The 2-story corner front porch is rather unusual. Lewis Rinde dealt in real estate. * The Severson house at 1124 E. Main Street is a 2-story Neoclassical-styled house built in 1904. Typical of the style, the front portico is supported by two Ionic columns and the building's corners are trimmed with pilasters. The roof is hipped with two gable-roofed dormers. Henry Severson had two tobacco farms and one of the first autos in town. Holtan house (Prairie style) * The Holtan house at 1004 E. Main Street is a Prairie School-style house. The Holtans built a house here in 1896, but it was probably rebuilt or extensively remodeled around 1911 to a style then current. Typical of Prairie school is the horizontal emphasis in the wide, flared eaves. Unusual is the decorated fascia on the eaves. John Holtan managed the American Cigar Company, and served mayor and president of the First National Bank of Stoughton.

Snyder, 469 U.S. 153 (1985), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that if the author of a work authorizes derivatives, the terms negotiated in exchange for that grant stand even if the grant is later rescinded. If the copyright holder deputizes another person to authorize derivative works, the law draws no distinction between such works and those directly authorized by the copyright holder. The case was a dispute regarding publishing royalties for the popular song \\"Who's Sorry Now?\\", which Mills Music had licensed (through mechanical licenses) to recording companies, who created records of the song, or derivative works; after the death of Ted Snyder, the song's composer, his heirs terminated the agreement with Mills Music. They believed that Mills was no longer entitled to its share in the royalties. Mills, through the Harry Fox Agency, sued in federal court in New York, where it won, but was overturned in the Second Circuit, before finally appealing to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari in March 1984.

She is also an Adjunct Professor at the Rockefeller University, where she was previously Associate Professor and head of the Laboratory of Lymphocyte Biology. She is best known for her work in the fields of DNA and RNA editing.  Education and early career  Papavasiliou received her Bachelors of Science from Oberlin College in biology in 1992. She then completed her PhD at the Rockefeller University in Michel C. Nussenzweig's Laboratory of Molecular Immunology. There, she began studying how B cell antigen receptors‚Äîor antibodies anchored to the cell membrane‚Äîundergo mutation so they can specifically recognize a particular antigen and elicit an immune response. She followed that interest to the Yale School of Medicine, where she worked as a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of David G. Schatz.  Research  Papavasiliou's research centers on demystifying how cells and organisms diversify and expand the information encoded in their genomes, both at the DNA and RNA level. She opened her Laboratory of Lymphocyte Biology at Rockefeller University in 2001 as an Assistant Professor. Much of her group's early work was done in the context of the adaptive immune response, which is able to combat a wide array of pathogens seeking to invade the host by rapidly generating novel antibodies that are able to specifically recognize a given invader. Her group has worked to characterize the activity of an enzyme known as activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). AID changes cytidine (C) residues to uracil (U) in DNA, which is recognized as DNA damage and repaired in such a way that introduces thymidine (T), effectively mutating Cs to Ts in DNA. The process is known as somatic hypermutation and is how B cells can rapidly introduce DNA mutations into receptors that recognize the invaders, known as antigens. Papavasiliou's lab has worked to understand how AID expression is regulated in the immune system and how AID targets certain genes for mutation. Papavasiliou also studies RNA editing in the context of the innate immune response using next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics approaches to identify and characterize RNA editing targets. Her group first identified novel RNA editing targets of APOBEC1, which mutates a cytosine to a uracil in an RNA transcript, and was previously thought to only edit Apolipoprotein B (apoB) in the small intestine. Her group has since moved on to attempt to characterize the potential role APOBEC1-editing may be playing outside of its function with apoB. Papavasiliou most recently branched out to studying mechanisms of antigenic variation‚Äîor how pathogens vary their surface proteins to escape the immune response‚Äîusing Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite that causes African sleeping sickness, as a model organism. Her group has developed new tools to better understand the dynamics of protein coat switching in trypanosomes, and is working to better understand the mechanisms by which trypanosomes are able to diversify their coat proteins over the course of an infection. In 2016, Papavasiliou moved to the German Cancer Research Center to begin her lab in the Division of Immune Diversity with additional support from a European Research Council Consolidator Grant.

The school was added to the State Register of Historic Places in 2010 and to the National Register of Historic Places the following year. History An earlier one-room school was built of wood on this site between 1855 and 1861. The building was constructed on land that was donated by Bavarian immigrants Agidius and Anna Frey. For many years the Freys provided water for drinking and wood for heating the school. By 1870 the school population had outgrown that first building, so the district replaced the old wooden school with this building. Its walls are locally-quarried sandstone, somewhat coursed. The front door with the pointed top is stylish compared to the rest of the building. Inside is a vestibule where coats were hung, then the one classroom. Interior walls and ceiling are plastered. Three other one-room schools were built of sandstone in the township. Of them all, the Frey School is the most intact.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places, along with the State Register of Historic Places, in 1998. John Fritz was born in Kindenheim, Bavaria in 1826. When he was ten, his family migrated to New York State. Around 1848 the family moved west to the wilds of Wisconsin. In 1849 John started a farm a few miles west in the Town of Primrose, with his family nearby, but a year later he bought the first 200 acres of this farm. Settlement of Montrose had begun in 1840, so Fritz wasn't the first settler, but he was early. With A log house was on the farm when John bought it. None of the buildings from those early years remain. In those early years John raised wheat to sell. He also had a few milk cows and made butter from their milk. He had a few other cattle, and more pigs than the neighbors. He grew oats, hay and potatoes. Most of these animals and crops would have been familiar to Bavarian farmers. John had married Julia Colby, a Norwegian immigrant, but she died in 1853. In 1854 he remarried, to Betsey Elefson, another Norwegian. While some early German immigrants in Dane County clustered together, the town of Montrose was fairly mixed already, with immigrants from the Northeast, North Carolina, England, Ireland and Sweden. By the 1860 census John and Betsey had five children. Some time after that they divorced and John married Betsey's sister Margaret. By the 1870 census they had a total of seven children in the house. In 1868 the growing family built a new house, the north wing of the current house, at left in the photo. It is 23 by 29 feet, two stories, with walls of coursed limestone sitting on a foundation of random rubble. On the front, the mortar is tooled into a raised bead. Windows and the door on the front are all symmetric, with a lunette window in the gable. The first floor of the south wing was added about ten years later, with the second floor completed by the early 1890s. The south wing is built of stone and technique similar to the earlier section, except that the walls sat directly on the ground without footings. The basement barn was built in the late 1800s. The barn is 76 by 36 feet, on a random stone foundation. Its northern 22 feet may have been added after the south end. The basement is laid out with a center aisle. An earthen ramp gives access to the haymow. The concrete silo was added in the 1920s and the bull pen and milk house later. The wooden granary was built around 1900. The square of farm buildings also includes a corn crib and piggery built by the late 1940s John's third wife Margaret died in 1886, and he married Thursa Rice Lawrence. John and Thursa moved to nearby Belleville in 1906 and died shortly after. Some time before that, John's son Marcus bought the farm. Marcus and his wife Laura had expanded the farm to 393 acres by 1914. Marcus died in 1925 and his sons Stanley and Clarence ran the firm until 1976. As of 1998, the farm was still in the Fritz family.

It has been used as a musical means of establishing a pro-democracy movement. It is mainly enjoyed by people who were critical of mainstream song culture during the democratization movement. The term \\"minjung-gayo\\" was coined in the mid-1980s when protest movements were rapidly growing in Korea, and to differentiate the minjung-gayo from popular songs. The minjung-gayo specifically includes the anti-Japanese songs from the Japanese colonial era, which continued until the early 1970s, and generally refers to the culture that began to mature in the late 1970s and which lasted until 1990.  The concept This picture is about 4th 'Gather! Rage! Resign Park Geun-hye Park Geun-hye' Demonstration in 2016 According to one scholar, the minjung-gayo reflects the will of the crowd and voices the criticism of the day. Korean protest songs emerged in the 1980s, especially before and after the June democracy movement in 1987. They were particularly common in the 1970s and 1980s, against the military governments of Presidents Park Jeong-hee (Korean: Î∞ïÏ†ïÌù¨) and Jeon Doo-Hwan (Korean: Ï†ÑÎëêÌôò).  Before the 1980s  Korean protest songs accompanied the Korean students' movement around 1970. The subject matter of these early songs heavily criticized pop music or had a theme of overcoming hardship. Thus, Korean students started their own unique music culture, distinct from pop culture. Some of the early songs were called 'Demo-gas' (demonstration songs) and others were called minjung-gayo (Korean protest songs). There were also 'Haebang-ga' (Hangul: Ìï¥Î∞©Í∞Ä), 'Tana-Tana' and 'Barami-bunda' (Hanguel: Î∞îÎûåÏù¥ Î∂ÑÎã§), to name a few. After 1975, 'Hula-song' and 'Jungui-ga' were added to the list. In the era of emergency, Korean universities became more rigid. Students who participated in the movement had to risk their lives to do so and thus had a stronger faith. These students began to criticize the old social system, starting a progressive political culture. The unique criticism by university students during this time period established the base of Korean protest songs.  During the 1980s  Tapes of Korean Protest Songs in 1980s The short \\"Spring of Democracy\\" in 1979, which came after the assassination of Park Chung-hee (or the \\"10.26 situation\\") was a chance for student movements to display the minjung-gayo in public demonstrations. Organizers of demonstrations would distribute flyers with the lyrics and minjung-gayo sheet music to attendees. The songs caught on as a part of protest culture. The history of Korean protest songs in the 1980s can be divided into three periods. The first period was the protest songs, or the period when many songs were composed as marching songs. The March For Her (Hangul: ÏûÑÏùÑ ÏúÑÌïú ÌñâÏßÑÍ≥°) was written and the number of minjung-gayo skyrocketed between 1980 and 1984. The second period started with young men, which were fresh out of college, who had been members of music clubs. These men performed a concert inspired by the story told in the song Eggplant Flower (Hangul: Í∞ÄÏßÄÍΩÉ) in the Aeogae theater, by lending the name of the theater Handurae (Hangul: ÌïúÎëêÎ†à). In this period, the social movement had become even more musical. The third period is after the democratic uprising in June 1987. The first regular performance of 'People-seeking music' was held in Korean churches for the 100th anniversary memorial in October 1987, after the great labor conflict in mid-to-late 1987. In this period, people had recognized the limits of the universities' minjung-gayo movement and were trying to figure out how they could overcome and surpass them. After the great labor conflict in July to September 1987, minjung-gayo reflected workers' joys and sorrows. After going through this period, protest songs include and embrace not only intellectuals, but also the working-class population.  During and after the 1990s  From the mid-1990s, and possibly due to the decrease in the social voice of student demonstrations and labor demonstrations, the Korean protest songs lost their popularity in many other fields (except the struggle scenes). In this period, the music groups in universities and the professional cultural demonstration groups started trying to change the form of Korean protest songs by trying new things, but it was not easy to change such a generalized form of music into a new wave. In the 2000s, participatory demonstration culture started settling. In this period, the songs, not having such solemn atmosphere like 'Fucking USA' and 'The First Korean Constitution' were made, but their influence did not spread beyond the field.  Representative artists   Kim Min-Ki  Born in Iksan-si, Jeollabuk-do, Kim Min-Ki moved to Seoul before he was in primary school. When he was at Seoul National University, he started writing music and formed the group 'Doobidoo'. At that time, he met Helen Yang, his primary school friend, and wrote her a song named 'Morning dew' (Hangul: ÏïÑÏπ® Ïù¥Ïä¨) which was released in 1970. In 1972, he was arrested for singing songs such as 'We will win' (Hangul: Ïö∞Î¶¨ ÏäπÎ¶¨ÌïòÎ¶¨Îùº), 'Freedom Song' (Hangul: Ìï¥Î∞©Í∞Ä), 'The Child Blowing Flowers' (Hangul: ÍΩÉÌîºÏö∞Îäî ÏïÑÏù¥), with all of his songs prevented from being broadcast. After he left the Korean army, he wrote Hee Eun Yang's song 'Like the Pine Needles in Wild Grassland' (Hangul:Í±∞ÏπòÎ•∏ Îì§ÌåêÏùò Ìë∏Î•¥Î•∏ ÏÜîÏûéÏ≤òÎüº) and also 'The Light in the Factory' (Hangul: Í≥µÏû•Ïùò Î∂àÎπõ).  People Who Are Finding Songs  People Who Are Finding Songs (Hangul: ÎÖ∏ÎûòÎ•º Ï∞æÎäî ÏÇ¨ÎûåÎì§) is a music group that wrote Korean protest songs in the 1980s-1990s, known as nochatsa (Hangul:ÎÖ∏Ï∞æÏÇ¨). As Korean protest songs were not written for commercial success, they presented a more accurate depiction of contemporary political demonstrations against the Korean dictatorship than pop music. The group's albums were commercially successful and have made a strong impact in Korean pop music history. Their group consisted of Meari from Seoul University, Norea-erl from Korea University, Hansori from Ehwa Women University, Sori-sarang from Sungkyunkwan University, as well as many others.

He competes part-time in the NASCAR K&N; Pro Series West, driving the No. 32 Chevrolet for 1/4 Ley Racing. Racing career Quarterley on track during practice for the 2018 JustDrive.com 125. Quarterley's NASCAR career started in 1994, when he began competing in what was then known as the NASCAR Busch North Series. He entered his own car in a race at Lime Rock Park, finishing 12th. Quarterley continued making sporadic Busch North starts before running the full season for the first time in 2001. He scored his first win at Beech Ridge Motor Speedway, leading all but two laps. In 2002, Quarterley nearly won at Watkins Glen International, winning the pole and leading the most laps. However, he ran out of fuel during a green-white-checker finish. Quarterley eventually scaled back to a part-time schedule. Despite originally announcing plans to run the West Series race at Sonoma, he sat out the entire 2007 season. During the season, he served as crew chief for John Salemi. In 2008, Quarterley drove two road course races on back-to-back weekends in the renamed Nationwide Series for Mike Harmon Racing. He finished 42nd and 41st at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve and Watkins Glen respectively. Quarterley's 2011 season was highlighted by a second-place finish at Dover International Speedway. He was later fined, however, for a shock absorber violation on his car. In 2018, Quarterley returned to the K&N; Pro Series East after a two-year absence to compete for NextGen Motorsports in the JustDrive.com 125. He qualified 15th and finished 13th, dropping out after 43 laps with rear end problems on the car. Motorsports career results NASCAR (key) (Bold ‚Äì Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

She is best known for her work as the principal of the Presbyterian Ladies' College (PLC), at Croydon in inner-west Sydney, where she worked for 18 years.  Biography  Whitlam was born in Mosman on 11 September 1920 and is the sister of Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam. In 1927, she and her family moved to Canberra. Whitlam attended Canberra Girls Grammar School. She studied at Abbotsleigh and Canberra University College. During World War II, she served with the WAAAF, joining in 1943. After the war, she earned a Bachelor of Arts from Melbourne University. Whitlam went on to teach French in Canberra and learned Latin and Esperanto. In 1954, she earned a Fulbright Scholarship to study at Yale. She earned her master's degree there in 1955 and then went on to take further studies at London University. Whitlam became the new principal of the Presbyterian Ladies' College (PLC) starting in 1958. Whitlam resigned from the school in 1976, citing political issues between herself and the school's council as the reason for her early retirement. In 1977, a Union of the Congregational, Methodist and Presbyterian churches took place, forming the Uniting Church in Australia. Approximately one-third of the Presbyterian Church decided to remain Presbyterian, and consequently the property of the church had to be divided. In May of that year it was announced that PLC Croydon was to remain Presbyterian and PLC Pymble would be transferred, with its name changed to Pymble Ladies' College. Then in 1978 it was decided that PLC Croydon should return to its original name: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney.McFarlane, John (1988). \\"Preparation For Expansion 1977-1985\\". The Golden Hope: Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney 1888-1988. p. 129. Freda Whitlam took part in the movement to form the Uniting Church and thus ended her principalship of the school. She was appointed moderator of the New South Wales Synod of the Uniting Church in Australia in 1985 and served in that role until 1986. In 1986, she told The Sydney Morning Herald that she identifies as a feminist. Whitlam was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the 1987 Australia Day Honours for \\"service to education and to the community\\". She was involved in drug reform in 1993, where she signed onto a charter to abolish criminal sanctions for personal illegal drug use. In 1999, Whitlam was awarded an honorary doctorate of letters from the University of Western Sydney. PLC named their school of science after her in 1998. She continued to teach Latin well into her nineties. Whitlam died in a nursing home in Penrith on 30 May 2018.

He was a prolific artist of the shin-hanga and s≈çsaku-hanga styles. Okuyama is noted for his landscape prints, both in color and black-and-white, as well as his simple prints of scenes that interject elements of the modernization of Japan into an otherwise traditional view.  Biography  Gihachiro Okuyama was born in the city of Sagae, Yamagata, in the Tohoku region, on February 17, 1907. He began as a commercial artist, creating advertising art for many different companies and establishing his own advertising company in 1931. He created successful commercial art for the Japan Wool Company and Nikka Whiskey. https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=6ZjqDb- zwVQC&lpg;=PA343&dq;=gihachiro%20okuyama&pg;=PA120#v=onepage&q;=gihachiro%20okuyama&f;=false Guide to Modern Japanese Woodblock Prints: 1900-1975 By Helen Merritt, Nanako Yamada Okuyama studied printmaking with Gajin Kosaka beginning in 1923, as well as with noted artist Kendo Ishii, and began exhibiting prints with the Nihon Sosaku Hanga Association in 1927. https://www.roningallery.com/artists/okuyama-gihachiro During World War 2, he was a member of the Nihon Hanga Hokokai, an organization created to ensure access to production materials for hanga artists during the war. After the end of the war, he created the Nihon Hanga Kenkyusho to develop an avenue for hanga artists to publish and market their works. https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=cY0DAi1-GP4C&lpg;=PA119&dq;=gihachiro%20okuyama&pg;=PA119#v=onepage&q;=gihachiro%20okuyama&f;=false Beyond the Great Wave: The Japanese Landscape Print, 1727-1960 By James King  Artistic style  Okuyama was an extremely prolific artist, creating over 1000 works in his lifetime. He moved freely between the shin-hanga and s≈çsaku- hanga styles. His shin-hanga works are consistent with other artists in this style, with evocative colors and smooth gradations giving the works depth and realism. His sosaku hanga works are intentionally rustic, either in black and white or a limited color palette. These works often feature modern technological intrusions, like metal truss bridges or electric transmission towers, a juxtaposition of westernization into Japanese rural scenes. https://www.artelino.com/articles/okuyama_gihachiro.asp  References   Bibliography  * Helen Merritt and Nanako Yamada, \\"Guide to Modern Japanese Woodblock Prints: 1900-1975\\", published by University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, . * James King, \\"Beyond the Great Wave: The Japanese Landscape Print, 1727-1960\\", published by Peter Lang, Bern,  External links  *https://www.artelino.com/articles/okuyama_gihachiro.asp *https://www.roningallery.com/artists/okuyama-gihachiro Category:1907 births Category:1981 deaths Category:Japanese printmakers Category:Ukiyo-e artists Category:Shin hanga artists Category:20th-century Japanese painters Category:20th-century printmakers ","title":"Gihachiro Okuyama"},{"id":"57817034","text":"The Brownie Chasma is a Chasma located on Ariel.http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/895 They are named after Brownies, which are spirits believed to help with household tasks.

Shortly before their withdrawal from the area, German soldiers arrived at the Einstein residence, executed Robert's wife and two daughters, and set the house on fire. Robert, who was in hiding at the time, survived the events but committed suicide less than a year later, on 13 July 1945. The perpetrators of the crime were never brought to justice, despite attempts in the early 2010s in both Germany and Italy to identify them. The events were also the subject of a German documentary featuring Einstein's nieces who witnessed the events in 1944. Background Robert Einstein was born in 1884 in Munich, the son of Jakob Abraham Einstein. Robert was a cousin of Nobel Prize Laureate Albert Einstein, as Hermann Einstein, Albert's father, was an older brother and business partner of Jakob Einstein, who persuaded his older brother to move their families and factory to Pavia, Italy. In 1944, Robert Einstein, who had lived in Italy for many decades, resided with his family in Rignano sull‚ÄôArno, southeast of Florence, in the Villa Tenuta dell Focardo. His family consisted of Caesarina, his wife, the daughter of a Protestant minister, his two daughters Luce and Cici, 27 and 18 years old respectively, and his adopted nieces Lorenza and Paola Mazzetti, who were the 17-year-old twin daughters of his late sister-in-law. In August 1944, the British 8th Army was advancing towards Florence, eventually liberating the city on 4 August. Einstein himself had gone into hiding with local partisans as he was concerned for his life because of his name and his Jewish background. However, he considered his family not to be in danger. Murders On 3 August, a group of German soldiers arrived at the villa in search of Einstein. When he was not to be found the soldiers began vandalising the place and interrogated the women individually. The soldiers conducted an ad-hoc tribunal and then shot Einstein's wife and daughters in the garden. His nieces remained locked in the upper part of the house, guarded by a young German soldier who had refused to participate in the murders and was visibly shaken by the events. After the murders the two surviving girls were locked in a shed and the villa itself set on fire. Aftermath Einstein returned to the house when he saw the flames (other sources state that he returned the following day). Upon finding his wife and daughters dead, he attempted suicide but was unsuccessful. British troops soon arrived in the area and Einstein used his famous surname to request an investigation into the murders. A few days later a scrap of paper was found, alleging that Einstein's family was executed because they were Jewish (they were not), and because they were spies. Einstein pushed for an investigation of the crime and even requested help from his cousin Albert. There was an Army JAG report of the incident and the investigation. Einstein committed suicide on 13 July 1945, his 32nd wedding anniversary, by overdosing on sleeping tablets. He is buried alongside his family in the cemetery at Badiuzza. His nieces Lorenza and Paola Mazzetti survived the war and were the subject of a German documentary in 2016. Investigation In 2007, German authorities started an investigation into the events and interviewed Lorenza Mazzetti. Originally it was thought that the main instigator was still alive and living in Rhineland-Palatinate. In 2011 the case was the subject of an episode of Aktenzeichen XY ‚Ä¶ ungel√∂st, a German TV crime program, which aimed to find surviving eyewitnesses, especially the young German soldier who had refused to participate in the events. However, this effort was unsuccessful. Mazzetti visited Germany during the investigation and was convinced that she identified the main perpetrator of the crime after seeing a photo of him. The suspected perpetrator, known to the Simon Wiesenthal Center, is also suspected to have participated in a massacre of 184 civilians in Padule di Fucecchio on 23 August 1944 and lived in Kaufbeuren, Bavaria. A court in Rome passed a life sentence in absentia on the former soldier for this massacre, but Germany did not extradite him. The German authorities in Kempten, Bavaria, later also declared him unfit to stand trial. Documentary The Mazzetti sisters, now living in Rome and almost 90 years old, were the subject of a 2016 German documentary by the Bayerischer Rundfunk, titled Einsteins Nichten (Einstein's Nieces). As part of this documentary the sisters returned to the crime scene for the first time since the events.

J. Abrams projects in roughly chronological order. During a career that has spanned over 30 years, J. J. Abrams has worked on projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. 1980s Who Framed Roger Rabbit (sequel) 2000s Superman: Flyby In July 2002, Abrams wrote a script for a possible fifth Superman film entitled Superman: Flyby. Brett Ratner and McG entered into talks to direct, although Abrams tried to get the chance to direct his own script. However, the project was finally cancelled in 2004, due to Superman Returns. Early attempt of The Dark Tower Mystery on Fifth Avenue In 2008, it was reported that Abrams purchased the rights to a New York Times article Mystery on Fifth Avenue about the renovation of an 8.5 million dollar co-op, a division of property originally owned by E. F. Hutton & Co. and Marjorie Merriweather Post, for six figures and was developing a film titled Mystery on Fifth Avenue, with Paramount Pictures and Bad Robot Productions, and comedy writers Maya Forbes and Wally Wolodarsky to write the adaptation. According to the article, a wealthy couple Steven B. Klinsky and Maureen Sherry purchased the apartment in 2003 and live there with their four children. Soon after purchasing the apartment, they hired young architectural designer Eric Clough, who devised an elaborately clever \\"scavenger hunt\\" built into the apartment that involved dozens of historical figures, a fictional book and a soundtrack, woven throughout the apartment in puzzles, riddles, secret panels, compartments, and hidden codes, without the couple's knowledge. The family didn't discover the embedded mystery until months after moving into the apartment. After Abrams purchased the article, Clough left him an encrypted message in the wall tiles of a Christian Louboutin shoe store he designed in West Hollywood.

The game is a psychological thriller infused with religious elements and revolves around Father Abraham, a priest who is trying to find the missing altar boy.  Gameplay  The gameplay is survival horror from a first-person perspective. The player takes the role of the protagonist, Father Abraham and explores the scenes by walking around and clicking on certain objects. The game features voice-overs and subtitles to convey the story and the player has the option to listen to recordings to learn more about it. In order to advance through the story, the player has to solve some puzzles and can optionally collect seven images of Christ. Depending on whether the player found all seven images or not, there are two different endings to discover.  Plot  The game is set on Christmas Eve in 1920. Father Abraham has to solve several mysteries at once, starting with the disappearance of altar boy David. It is implied that Father Abraham has killed several children and he has to find evidence in order to save himself from wrongful persecution. In dream-like sequences, Abraham finds more clues in a world from David and finally uncovers what really happened. Father Abraham has to piece these clues together in order to prove his innocence ‚Äî if he is innocent.  Development  The game has been in development since 2015, and after a failed Kickstarter campaign with only ‚Ç¨2,542 of the ‚Ç¨50,000 goal, it was released on June 7, 2018 for PC. The Bucharest-based games incubator/accelerator Carbon offered development funding for Gray Dawn and they also helped with mentorship as well as support with PR/Marketing. On July 13, 2018, an update was released including a German translation by Marcel Weyers as well as a Romanian and Hungarian translation.  Reception  The game received mixed or average reviews. Gray Dawn received a rating of 5/5 stars on digitallydownloaded.net with reviewer Ginny W. saying, \\"The real strength of Gray Dawn lies far from its decent controls, its ability to run economically on a PC whilst looking amazing, and its employment of psychological horror tropes to get your heart rate up. This game peers at the line between portraying real life religion in a game and using it as artful commentary, and completely obliterates it.\\" The Overpowered Noobs gave a rating of 7/10 and noted that, \\"Gray Dawn calls itself a horror title, a psychological thriller, and it certainly has elements of that, but it lacks the running, being hunted, and overall villain that many games in the same genre have.\\" Gamespace.com praised the \\"engaging story with twists\\", but criticized the voice acting, religious iconography, and the character model design, while saying, \\"Gray Dawn is true to its description of being a psychological thriller with religious elements, but it can‚Äôt seem to focus in on which religious elements it wants to portray.\\"  References   External links  * Official website Category:2018 video games Category:Dark fantasy video games Category:Psychological horror games Category:Video games developed in Romania Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Indie video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Unreal Engine games ","title":"Gray Dawn (video game)"},{"id":"57817247","text":"Eleanor Anne Holroyd is a New Zealand nursing academic.

The lateral sepals are a similar length but only about half as wide and spread apart from each other. The petals are long, about wide, asymmetrically egg-shaped with a small upturned tip. The labellum is flat, long, about wide, with short, thick purple calli near its base. The central part of the labellum is covered with dark purple hairs up to long and there is a glandular tip which is long and about wide. The column has two yellowish \\"eyes\\" joined by a faint ridge. Flowering occurs from December to February but the flowers only last between two and four days. Taxonomy and naming Calochilus praealtus was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones from a specimen collected in Mount Kaputar National Park and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (praealtus) is a Latin word meaning \\"very high\\". Jones gave the species the name Calochilus praeltus, misspelling the Greek word and mentioning that its meaning is \\"high altitude, elevation; in reference to its occurrence at high altitudes\\". The misspelling has been copied by the Australian Plant Name Index. Distribution and habitat The lofty beard orchid grows with grasses in snow gum woodland. It is only known from Barrington Tops and the Mount Kaputar National Park.

Life Day was born in London in January 1810. Though showing very strong musical tastes, in accordance with his father's wishes he studied medicine in London and Paris, and, after taking a medical degree at Heidelberg, settled in London in practice as a homeopath. For several years he devoted himself during his leisure hours to maturing a plan which he had conceived for forming a complete and logical theory of harmony out of the existing mass of isolated and often inconsistent rules. The results of his study were published in 1845 as A Treatise on Harmony. In almost every branch of the scientific basis of music Day proposed some reform. The work was unfavourably received, though its originality attracted the attention of a few scientific musicians. In a review of the work, George French Flowers wrote: > The Treatise on Harmony ... proposes an entirely new theory of music, > professing to distinguish between the artificial principles upon which the > earliest composers wrote, and the natural feelings from the dictates of > which the greatest beauties of the modern school have been produced.... With > these ambitious pretensions the work is, at least, worthy the careful > examination of all who are interested in the advancement of the arts; but it > is at the same time exposed to the prejudices arising from the wilful > tenacity of old and habitual notions.... George Alexander Macfarren adopted much of Day's theory, and mainly by his advocacy the work became a recognised authority on many of the subjects of which it treats. He resigned from the Royal Academy of Music in 1847 when his attachment to Day's work was questioned. Macfarren published a second edition of the Treatise in 1885; in the preface, he wrote: > The speciality of the treatise is twofold: firstly, the standard laws of the > ancient, strict, diatonic, artificial, or contrapuntal style are collected > and systematically codified ... and they are distinguished entirely from > those of the modern, free, chromatic, natural, or harmonic style; secondly, > though the natural chord of the dominant seventh had been more or less > freely used for ... three and a half centuries prior to the appearance of > this book ‚Ä¶ no systematic principles of fundamental harmony had ever been > deduced from the phenomena that bring that remarkable chord within the > resources of the musician.... Day's ideas were described in some detail by Hubert Parry in A Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1900). Day died of heart disease, after a long illness, on 11 February 1849.

It manufactures equipment and systems for avionics, military, industrial, and professional applications. Samtel Avionics is a subsidiary of the Samtel Group.  History  In 2006, Samtel entered a joint venture with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, the first public-private partnership in the sector. In 2008, the multi- functional displays developed by Samtel and the Defence Avionics Research Establishment (DARE) wing of the Indian Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) were approved for air worthiness and real-time flight trials, on board the SU-30 aircraft of the Indian Air Force. In 2009, the organization entered a joint venture agreement with Thales Air Defence, a France-based defence equipment manufacturer. The wholly owned subsidiaries of Thales Group, Thales Avionics and Thales International India, have invested 26% of the stakes in the joint venture. In 2009, Samtel Avionics inked a deal with Honeywell Aerospace, to manufacture avionics equipment for Electronic flight instrument system (EFIS), making it the first Indian manufacturer and sole supplier worldwide of this equipment for EFIS. In 2010, Samtel HAL Display Systems, a joint venture between Samtel Avionics and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, won a development order worth more than US$50 million, for the manufacture of indigenous multi-functional displays. In 2012, Samtel Thales JV entered an agreement with Thales to supply cockpit displays to Dassault, the manufacturer of the French Rafale on the purchase of the Rafale aircraft by Indian Air Force. Thales is a consortium partner with Dassault in the manufacturing of Rafale aircraft. In 2012, Samtel Avionics and Defence Systems signed a contract with Curtiss-Wright Controls Defense Solutions, for the supply of display head assemblies for the customers of Curtiss-Wright, such as Eurocopter, Agusta Westland, Sikorsky, etc. In 2013, Samtel Thales Avionics played a key role in the upgrade of Mirage-2000, a multirole combat fighter from Dassault Aviation of France, as the joint venture could economically manufacture the components designed by Thales in France, thus allowing Thales to significantly lower its bid for the Indian Air Force. Samtel is also responsible for the maintenance, repair, up gradation, and obsolescence management of this equipment. The joint venture also aims to build advanced systems, including Helmet Mounted Sight Display, intended for use by the Indian Navy. In 2014, Samtel signed a cooperation agreement with General Dynamics Canada, for the co-production of digital displays for various military and non-military vehicles. In 2016, Samtel-HAL JV completed the installation of 1,000 multi-functional displays in Sukhoi Su-30, India‚Äôs indigenous fighter aircraft. In 2017, Samtel and Hanwha Systems of South Korea entered a partnership agreement, to manufacture various missile electronics in India, with an aim to domestically produce critical parts for laser-guided bombs, missiles, and electronic warfare systems.  Awards and recognitions  * 2010: Samtel won the EMPI-Indian Express Innovation Award, for its innovative approach towards the indigenisation of high-technology display products. * 2012: Puneet Kaura, the Managing Director and CEO of Samtel Avionics, has received among the ‚Äô40 Under 40‚Äô of Aviation Week & Space Technology, as a rising star in the global aerospace & defence industry.

Prelude  On August 1, 1944 PowƒÖzki, like the rest of Warsaw, took part in the Uprising. Nearly 120 members of the Home Army Group \\"≈ªyrafa\\" tried to attack the Bem's Fort (so called Pionierpark) occupied by the Germans. However, the attack broke down under fire of German machine guns, which nested in a nearby military cemetery.

However, the Germans drove all the civilians out of the building and then rushed them towards the fort. There, the Poles were divided into two groups - one consisting of women and children, the other of men. After a few hours, a German officer spoke to the detainees, stating that German soldiers had been shot at from the house they lived in, as a result of which two Germans had been killed and one injured. The officer then spoke to the women and children as follows: \\"Your fathers, your bandit brothers, killed an officer and a German soldier, for which they will be shot.\\" Finally, he announced that women and children would remain hostage and would be shot if the condemned to death tried to resist or escape. Immediately after that speech, German soldiers took the men to the so-called \\"pond\\" near the Powazkowska Road, located near Bem's Fort and St. Joseph's Church.Maja Motyl, Stanis≈Çaw Rutkowski: Powstanie Warszawskie ‚Äì rejestr miejsc i fakt√≥w zbrodni.

This will be the 17th direct presidential election in the Philippines since 1935 and the seventh sextennial presidential election since 1986. Incumbent president Rodrigo Duterte is ineligible for re-election, pursuant to the 1987 Philippine Constitution. The position of president and vice president are elected separately, thus the two winning candidates could come from different political parties.  Electoral system  According to the Constitution of the Philippines of 1987, the election is held every six years after 1992, on the second Monday of May. The incumbent president is term limited. The incumbent vice president may run for two consecutive terms. The first-past-the-post voting system is used to determine the winner: the candidate with the highest number of votes, whether or not one has a majority, wins the presidency. The vice presidential election is a separate election, is held on the same rules, and voters may split their ticket. If two or more candidates wins the most number of votes for any position, Congress shall vote from among them which shall be president or vice president, as the case may be. Both winners will serve six-year terms commencing at noon on June 30, 2022, and ending on the same day six years later.  Background  The 2022 election will decide the successor of both President Rodrigo Duterte and Vice President Leni Robredo. In the 2016 presidential and vice presidential elections, Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte of Partido Demokratiko Pilipino- Lakas ng Bayan (PDP‚ÄìLaban) won against five other candidates, winning as president, while representative from Camarines Sur Leni Robredo of the Liberal Party won against Senator Bongbong Marcos and five others in the vice presidential election that is the closest margin since 1965. Marcos put the result under protest in the Presidential Electoral Tribunal. In July 2016, Vice President Robredo was appointed to head the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council, but later resigned in December 2016 after she was told to stop attending all cabinet meetings, amid her criticism of the administration's bloody war on drugs. His allies afterwards attempted to impeach her, with the president calling to end the impeachment. In the 17th Congress, the representative from Davao del Norte Pantaleon Alvarez was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives in July 2016. Faced with reports of destablization, Duterte in October 2017 said that he will declare revolutionary government, where it is understood that all positions in government are declared vacant, in order to prevent chaos. The president listed the Communist Party of the Philippines, the elites, and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency as the organizations that had a hand in efforts to destabilize the government. Midway the legislative term, former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who was the representative from Pampanga, ousted Alvarez from the speakership. The president's allies said that the ouster was due to a squabble between Alvarez and Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte, the president's daughter, who the latter branded the former as from the opposition when she launched the Hugpong ng Pagbabago, a regional political party in the Davao Region where both Davao del Norte and Davao City are a part of. In the 2019 midterm Senate election, the opposition fielded the Otso Diretso coalition, while the administration fielded their slate under the Hugpong ng Pagbabago banner. Hugpong won 9 of the 12 seats contested, while Otso Diretso won no seats. Cynthia Villar, wife of defeated 2010 presidential candidate Manuel Villar, topped the election, while 2013's topnotcher and 2016 defeated presidential candidate Grace Poe finished second. While Sara Duterte's Hugpong won in the Davao Region, they notably failed to unseat Alvarez, and PDP‚ÄìLaban defeated Hugpong candidate for governor of Davao del Norte, and won the province's both seats in the House of Representatives. On Marcos's electoral protest against Robredo, the Presidential Electoral Tribunal released in October 2019 the report on Marcos's pilot provinces of Camarines Sur, Iloilo and Negros Oriental, and showed that Robredo increased her lead by 15,742 votes. The tribunal voted to defer on deciding on the protest, and instead proceeded with Marcos's plea to nullify the votes from the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) provinces of Basilan, Lanao del Sur and Maguindanao. Those who dissented the decision said that the protest should have been dismissed, as Marcos failed to recover votes from his 3 pilot provinces, citing the rules of the tribunal; they were overruled when the others said that Marcos's plea on the ARMM provinces should also be resolved. A couple of weeks later, the president challenged Robredo to co-chair the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs (ICAD), the office that oversees the war on drugs, along with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency chief, which she accepted. A week later, Duterte said that he will fire Robredo if she shares state secrets about the drug war. Several days later, Duterte said he cannot trust Robredo, after she asked the government for a list of high value targets in the drug war. Robredo replied that \\"He should tell me straight if he wants me out.\\" Senator Francis Pangilinan of the Liberal Party said that Duterte could have fired Robredo instead of belittling her. A day later, Duterte fired Robredo as co-chair of the ICAD, with Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo shared that she spoke with foreigners, was asking for the scope of her powers and was among those daring the President to fire her, along with Senator Francis Pangilinan. In June 2020, American boxing promoter Bob Arum said that Senator Manny Pacquiao confided to him that he will run for president in 2022. Pacquiao later denied talking about politics with Arum. After remarks by actress Sharon Cuneta in July 2020 saying she hopes Robredo will succeed Duterte in 2022 so that \\"decency\\" will be restored in the country, Robredo said that she has no plans yet of running in 2022. Robredo had a televised speech in August claiming that the government had no plans on how to resolve the COVID-19 pandemic. She then shared 10 recommendations on how to resolve it. Duterte himself, in a separate speech days later, asked Robredo not to \\"add fuel to the fire\\", and that even if he dies, the problems of the country won't be solved. This comes as suggestions of a \\"revolutionary government\\" replacing the current constitutional government were put forward by the Mayor Rodrigo Roa Duterte ‚Äì National Executive Coordinating Committee (MRRD-NECC). Archie Gamboa, the chief of the Philippine National Police, said that he received an invitation from the group, but did not act on it. Duterte, in the same speech where he answered Robredo's suggestions, said that he does not know the people pushing for revolutionary government, and that he has nothing to do with it. After being disowned by Duterte, the MRRD-NECC offered Robredo a part in the plot; Robredo rejected the offer. Duterte then said that he wants the concept to be discussed in public.

By 2020, moves by the president's allies to amend the constitution, or establish a revolutionary government though are seen by critics as moved to abolish term limits, including the president's, or bypass the constitution altogether.

Massacre on Bracka Street - a series of murders, arson and other serious violations of the wartime law committed by soldiers of the German Wehrmacht during attempts to unblock the section of Jerozolimskie Avenue held by the insurgents in Warsaw. During the fights conducted on August 3-4, 1944, the soldiers of the 4th East Prussian Grenadier Regiment repeatedly used Polish civilians as \\"living shields\\", shielding the tanks' attacks on the insurgent barricades. They also committed a number of murders of prisoners of war and residents of houses on Bracka Street and Jerozolimskie Avenue. The number of victims could exceed 200.  German attack on the Main Railway Station  Jerozolimskie Avenues together with the adjacent Poniatowski Bridge constituted one of the most important communication arteries in Warsaw, which allowed the Germans to provide food and supplies for their units fighting with the Red Army on the right bank of the Vistula River. On the first day of the Warsaw Uprising (1 August 1944), Home Army soldiers attacked the most important German sites on Jerozolimskie Avenue (including the Main Railway Station, the Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego and the Poniatowski Bridge), however they failed to block this artery in any placeAdam Borkiewicz: Powstanie warszawskie. Zarys dzia≈Ça≈Ñ natury wojskowej. Warszawa: Instytut wydawniczy PAX, 1969. p. 59, 62, 65. Only at the height of Bracka Street was it possible to establish a weak connection with Home Army units in ≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie Po≈Çudniowe (Southern Downtown). The situation changed in favour of the insurgents on August 3. That day, in the early hours of the morning, the soldiers of Chrobry II group managed to take control of the buildings of the Postal Railway Station at the crossroads of Jerozolimskie Avenue and ≈ªelazna StreetThe shock group was commanded by lieutenant Zbigniew Brym, pseudonym \\"Zdunin\\".. The same unit then conquered the so-called Tourist House, located opposite the station, where contact was established with soldiers of the \\"Gurt\\" Group, who manned the nearby building of the Military Geographical Institute. At about 10:00 a.m. soldiers of both units went to the tunnel of the Warsaw Cross-City Line, where they captured a part of a German evacuation train, acquiring a lot of weapons. Jerozolimskie Avenue and the adjacent railway line were blocked by the insurgents from that time onAdam Borkiewicz: Powstanie warszawskie. Zarys dzia≈Ça≈Ñ natury wojskowej. Warszawa: Instytut wydawniczy PAX, 1969. p. 107. The Germans quickly started a counter-attack. Around noon, a strong armored column entered Jerozolimskie Avenue from the side of Towarowa Street, which forced its way from Wola towards Poniatowski BridgeThe column consisted of about twelve tanks, most probably belonging to the Armoured Parachute Division \\"Hermann G√∂ring\\". . German tanks, in front of which several hundred civilians captured in Wola were being rushed as \\"living shields\\", choked the defenders of the Postal Station with fire in order to reach the area around the bridge around 1 p.m.Adam Borkiewicz: Powstanie warszawskie. Zarys dzia≈Ça≈Ñ natury wojskowej. Warszawa: Instytut wydawniczy PAX, 1969. p. 105. On the other hand, around 3 p.m., from the side of Poniatowski Bridge, two battalions of the 4th East Prussian Grenadier Regiment (brought the day before from Zegrze) started to attack. German infantry supported by several tanks was attacking along 3 Maja Avenue and Jerozolimskie Avenue, trying to break through to the Main Railway Station, which was still manned by German units. In the section between Bracka Street and Nowy ≈öwiat Street, East Prussians encountered fierce resistance from Polish soldiers from the 3rd company of \\"Kilinski\\" Battalion and the so-called Collegium C (the even side of Jerozolimskie Avenue), KB \\"Sok√≥l\\" Battalion and the Home Army unit \\"Belt\\". (houses on the odd side)Robert Bielecki: W zasiƒôgu PAST-y. Warszawa: Czytelnik, 1994. . p. 119-120. By 7:00 p.m., the Germans managed to partially control the section of Jerozolimskie Avenue between Nowy ≈öwiat Street and Marsza≈Çkowska Street, but they did not manage to break through to the Main Railway Station. Moreover, the Home Army soldiers managed to keep the units in houses in Jerozolimskie Avenue No. 17 and No. 21. Due to serious losses and strong resistance of the insurgents, the Germans had to stop the attack and withdraw the main regiment forces to the area of the National Museum buildingRobert Bielecki: W zasiƒôgu PAST-y. Warszawa: Czytelnik, 1994. . p. 108. All they left were cover units in burned out houses No. 19 and No. 25. On August 4th, Jerozolimskie Avenue once again became an arena of fierce fights. In the morning, East Prussian grenadiers resumed their attack in the western direction. Then, a strong column of vehicles and infantry from the German 19th Armoured Division (from 60 to 80 tanks and cannons) broke out from the vicinity of Poniatowski Bridge to Ochota. As a result of a strong fire of the enemy, Home Army soldiers had to temporarily leave the burning Postal Railway Station. The Germans suffered serious losses (the 19th Armoured Division lost 11 dead and 40 wounded). The enemy did not make any attempt to permanently plant and secure Jerozolimskie Avenue either. The Germans maintained only the previously occupied Main Railway Station, the BGK building and the National Museum building, and also left several cover units in the ruins of houses on the section between Nowy ≈öwiat Street and Marsza≈Çkowska StreetAdam Borkiewicz: Powstanie warszawskie.

The Home Army soldiers, on the other hand, continued to maintain their positions in the Postal Railway Station building and in building No. 17, as a result of which none of the parties could use Jerozolimskie Avenue as a communication route. It was only after many days of fighting that the insurgents managed to secure the section of Jerozolimskie Avenue between Nowy ≈öwiat Street and Marsza≈Çkowska Street, which became the only on-ground corridor connecting the Northern and Southern Downtowns (August 10-25)Adam Borkiewicz: Powstanie warszawskie.

During the fights of August 3rd and 4th, 1944, East Prussian grenadiers committed a number of war crimes. On the entire route of the attack, the Polish population was expelled from the houses conquered by the Germans and then rushed to the National Museum building.

Polish civilians captured in Praga and in houses at 3 Maja Avenue were used by German soldiers as \\"living shields\\", covering the attacks of tanks on the insurgents' barricades. According to the account given by the witness of these events to the editors of the insurgent magazine \\"The Republic of Poland\\" (Rzeczpospolita Polska) (no. 26 (98) of 15 August 1944), in the morning of 3 August an officer of the German armoured forces chose about 60 men from the crowd of civilians imprisoned in the basement of the National Museum. He then ordered them to form a column (5-6 people in each row), which was rushed in front of the tanks towards the insurgents' positions. At the crossroads of Bracka Street and Jerozolimskie Avenue, civilians from the \\"living shield\\" got into the crossfire and were massacred. The Germans shot or threw grenades at the hostages who fled or tried to hide from the bulletsMaja Motyl, Stanis≈Çaw Rutkowski: Powstanie Warszawskie ‚Äì rejestr miejsc i fakt√≥w zbrodni. Warszawa: GKBZpNP-IPN, 1994 p. 66-65. As a result, around 50 to 60 Polish civilians died. The above mentioned witness testified that only five men managed to return to the National Museum, including three wounded and one burnt (who died soon after). The Germans acted in a similar way during the fights on August 4th. This morning, about 100 men - civilians and a few insurgents captured in Powi≈õle - were taken out of the basement of the National Museum and rushed towards the insurgents' barricades. Many hostages died during the shooting or were murdered by the Germans. A few managed to escape to the area controlled by the insurgents. The hostages were also used to cover the column from the German 19th Armoured Division, which was breaking through to the west. Initially, civilians detained in the museum cellars were used again for this purpose. However, many hostages fled or died in the first phase of the attack. The Germans took several hundred civilians out of their homes at the intersection of Marsza≈Çkowska Street with Nowogrodzka Street and Jerozolimskie Avenue. They shielded the passage of the column until the crossroads of Jerozolimskie Avenue and Cha≈Çubi≈Ñskiego Street, where they were then kept under guard for several hours. On August 3-4, East Prussian Grenadiers carried out a number of executions. According to a situation report prepared by an unknown Home Army unit in the evening of August 5, 1944, the Germans murdered all the men captured in the houses at 8 and 16 Jerozolimskie Avenue and in the corner house of Nowy ≈öwiat Street - 3 Maja Avenue. A doctor helping the injured was shot at the insurgent bandage point at 16 Jerozolimskie Avenue, and the head of the sanitary section burned to death in a building set on fire by the GermansLudno≈õƒá cywilna w powstaniu warszawskim. T. II i III. Warszawa: Pa≈Ñstwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1974. p. 57-58Maja Motyl, Stanis≈Çaw Rutkowski: Powstanie Warszawskie ‚Äì rejestr miejsc i fakt√≥w zbrodni. Warszawa: GKBZpNP- IPN, 1994. p. 65. On the other hand, \\"Biuletyn Informacyjny\\" no. 43/44 informed that the Germans were responsible for the deaths of residents of tenement houses at 17 Bracka Street and 19 Jerozolimskie Avenue (40 men and several women were to be killed in the latter house). Antoni Przygo≈Ñski estimated the total number of people executed at about 100. Men who lived at the corner of Marsza≈Çkowska Street and Jerozolimskie Avenue avoided death because a silesian man, drafted into the Wehrmacht, allowed them to escape at the right time to the house occupied by the insurgents. The insurgents who were taken captive were also murdered. One of the biggest executions took place in Powi≈õle, where after a failed assault on the Poniatowski Bridge several dozen poorly armed soldiers from 1138. and 1139. platoons of the 3rd Home Army Group \\"Konrad\\" were cut off in the house at 3 Maja Street No. 2. During the German counterattack on 3 August 1944 tanks broke the gate of the house, and terrified residents hung the white flag. Home Army soldiers managed to get rid of weapons and insurgent armbands, and then they mixed with a group of civilians. After taking control of the house, the Germans separated the men from the women and started the selection process. Barbara Sikora, the daughter of the housekeeper and a well-known Gestapo collaborator, actively helped them find the insurgents (she revealed that about 50 Home Army soldiers hid in the house). Volksdeutsch Koenig also participated in the selection, but he did not indicate any insurgents and even rescued several soldiers. Finally, the Germans chose 20 soldiers of \\" Konrad \\" Group from the crowd, whom they then gathered under the arch of the viaduct (the so-called cochlea). A tenant of the house managed to bribe the guards and take Zbys≈Çaw Przepi√≥rka, pseudonym \\"Zbyszko\\" out of the group of prisonersAdam de Michelis, Alicja Rudniewska: Pod rozkazami ‚ÄûKonrada‚Äù. Pierwsza monografia III Zgrupowania Obwodu Warszawskiego AK. Warszawa: Oficyna Wydawnicza ‚ÄûVolumen‚Äù, 1993. . p. 117-121. It is probable that on the same day the remaining 19 prisoners were shot under the viaduct. The Germans took the second group of suspects, most of them hidden insurgents, to Wio≈õlarska StreetWomen and other tenants were driven to Saska Kepa and allowed to return home after some time.. Their testimonies were so consistent that the Germans decided not to execute them immediately and closed the detainees in the tower of the Poniatowski Bridge. They were kept there for almost two weeks (food and water were provided to them by the population of Saska Kƒôpa). Around August 18-19, the prisoners were taken to the barracks at 11 Listopada Street, in Praga, where they worked for two weeks loading wagons. Later, they were taken to the transit camp in Pruszk√≥w and from there to the Stutthof concentration campAdam de Michelis, Alicja Rudniewska: Pod rozkazami ‚ÄûKonrada‚Äù. Pierwsza monografia III Zgrupowania Obwodu Warszawskiego AK. Warszawa: Oficyna Wydawnicza ‚ÄûVolumen‚Äù, 1993. . p. 121-122. During the fights to unblock the Jerozolimskie Avenue, the Germans carried out a number of material damages. On the 3rd of August, they set fire to the houses at 18, 20, 22, 32, 34 and 36 Jerozolimskie Avenue, as well as to the upper floors of the tenement house at 17 Bracka Street, with petrol and gunfire from tank guns, the fire also struck fragments of the odd side of Jerozolimskie Avenue. The next day, the Germans set fire to all the tenement houses on the even side of Jerozolimskie Avenue, between Bracka Street and Nowy ≈öwiat Street. All the houses between Smolna Street and 3 Maja Avenue were also set on fire, as well as several houses in Nowy Swiat Street (in the latter the Germans were to prevent the evacuation of civilians from the burning buildings)Maja Motyl, Stanis≈Çaw Rutkowski: Powstanie Warszawskie ‚Äì rejestr miejsc i fakt√≥w zbrodni. Warszawa: GKBZpNP-IPN, 1994. p. 108. All crimes described above were committed with knowledge and approval of the German command. The captured soldier of the 4th East Prussian Grenadier Regiment, Walther Brunon Dolingkeit (Protestant minister in civilian life), testified that his unit had been ordered to kill all the men it had met, to remove women and children from the homes, and to burn the buildings[12]. The civilians imprisoned in the National Museum building were treated as hostages. In the evening situation report of the German 9th Army of 4 August 1944, it was stated that out of nearly 4000 Warsaw residents \\"women and children will be released this night, instructing them that if the fire is not interrupted by 8:00 a.m., they will be responsible for the execution of their husbands and fathers, as well as all other men, because the soldiers are unable to distinguish who is an enemy and who is a friend\\"Ludno≈õƒá cywilna w powstaniu warszawskim. T. II i III. Warszawa: Pa≈Ñstwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1974. p. 50. In the end, this threat did not materialise. Some men (qualified as \\"sick\\") were released together with women and children. The rest were deported from Warsaw.  Comments   References   Bibliography  * Robert Bielecki: W zasiƒôgu PAST-y. Warszawa: Czytelnik, 1994. . * Adam Borkiewicz: Powstanie warszawskie.

Road Racing World Championship season. The season calendar has been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the cancellation or postponement of many races and an overall delay to the start of the season. On 11 June, the rescheduled calendar was confirmed, with the season beginning on 19 July with the Spanish Grand Prix in Jerez. On 31 July, the FIM announced that the remaining flyaway races were to be cancelled, marking the first time since 1986 that the premier class was held entirely within Europe. With 14 rounds, the season will hold the fewest total races since 1998. In mid- October, Valentino Rossi became the first premier class rider to test positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, forcing him to miss the Aragon and Teruel rounds due to Italian quarantine regulations. Marc M√°rquez and Repsol Honda started the season as the defending World Champion and World Constructors' champions respectively, after they both won their championships in 2019 for the fourth consecutive season. After an opening round crash resulting in a fractured humerus, M√°rquez has missed the majority the season rendering him mathematically unable to defend his title for a fifth consecutive time. As of mid-October, Joan Mir leads the riders' standings despite not winning any races to date, and Yamaha leads the constructors' standings with wins from three different riders. Riders Fabio Quartararo, Brad Binder, Miguel Oliveira and Franco Morbidelli won their first premier class victories during the season and KTM took their first wins as a constructor. Four riders taking their innaugural victories in the season matches the record set in the 2016 season. In addition, three teams (Petronas SRT, KTM Factory Racing and Tech3, respectively) won their first races in the premier class. Between the Czech Republic and Aragon Grands Prix, eight different riders won in eight successive races, equaling the previous record between the 2016 Italian and San Marino Grands Prix.

Rider changes *Johann Zarco and Red Bull KTM Factory Racing announced midway through the 2019 season that they would end their relationship prematurely. Zarco was originally contracted through the end of 2020. His seat was taken by 2016 Moto3 champion Brad Binder, who moved up to MotoGP from KTM's Moto2 program. Binder was originally slotted to replace Hafizh Syahrin at Red Bull KTM Tech3. Instead, fellow KTM Moto2 rider Iker Lecuona was promoted to the MotoGP class to replace Syahrin, who returned to Moto2. *Three-time MotoGP World Champion Jorge Lorenzo retired at the conclusion of the 2019 season, after 12 seasons in the premier class. He was replaced at Repsol Honda by 2019 Moto2 champion √Ålex M√°rquez, alongside his brother Marc M√°rquez. On 30 January 2020, Jorge Lorenzo was confirmed to be returning to Yamaha as a part of the manufacturer's European testing team. Before the start of the season, Lorenzo confirmed that he would make a wildcard entry for Yamaha at the Catalunya round. Due to the COVID-19 response, wildcard entries were later forbidden to minimize paddock personnel. *Between the Valencia and Jerez 2019 post-season tests, it was announced that Reale Avintia had elected to prematurely terminate Karel Abraham's contract which would have seen him with the team through the end of 2020. Abraham confirmed his retirement from MotoGP after 8 years in the premier class. Johann Zarco joined Reale Avintia in Karel Abraham's place. *Andrea Iannone was handed a provisional suspension from all FIM-sanctioned events on 17 December 2019 for a failed doping test after the Malaysian Grand Prix. On 31 March 2020, the FIM International Disciplinary Court upheld the suspension and commuted it to an 18-month ban from the beginning of the provisional suspension. Bradley Smith replaced him beginning with the first 2 rounds of 2020, as Iannone awaited the results of his appeal. By mid-August, Iannone's appeal was postponed until 15 October, meaning Smith will continue as replacement rider at least until the French Grand Prix.  Mid-season changes  * Stefan Bradl replaced Marc M√°rquez from the Czech Republic round onwards while he recovered from injuries sustained in an opening round crash at the Spanish Grand Prix. * Ducati test rider Michele Pirro replaced Francesco Bagnaia in both Austrian rounds while Bagnaia recovered from injuries sustained in a crash during practice at the Czech Republic Grand Prix. * Valentino Rossi tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus on 15 October, requiring him to quarantine for a minimum of 10 days according to Italian law and forcing him to miss the Aragon and Teruel rounds. Yamaha confirmed that they would not field a replacement for Rossi at the Teruel round on 25 October.

Also, its interior mirror these attributes. The building is of architectural value because it is the best example in the County of Essex of Modern design, popularly known as International style. Following modernist design principles, Thomson's building features open space planning with harmony and balance.

The Serbian Orthodox Community of Lakeshore (Ontario, Canada) was initially founded by His Grace Georgije ƒêokiƒá in November 2013. The mission is to unite the Serbian Orthodox Community of Lakeshore in preserving and celebrating its faith, the Serbian traditions, culture and ethos. The school building now altered inside serves as a parish home to a hundred Serbian families in Tecumseh and Lakeshore, Ontario. Most of them arrived after the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, beginning in the early 1990s.

High ranking German politicians courted former Waffen-SS members and their veteran organisation, HIAG. A small number of veterans, somewhat controversially, served in the new German armed forces, the Bundeswehr. Apart from war-time leaders of the Waffen-SS like Paul Hausser or Kurt Meyer, who published a number of revisionist or uncritical books on the Waffen-SS, former enlisted members also rose to prominence, like G√ºnter Grass, who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1999 and actor Hardy Kr√ºger. In the post-war years HIAG exercised some political influence in West Germany, and made attempts to appeal to the mainstream parties, but this changed in the 1960s when the veteran organisation, having achieved its aim, shifted to extreme right-wing politics. HIAG itself greatly exaggerated its influence and, at no point, represented more than eight percent of all the Waffen-SS veterans in West Germany. A historical review in Germany of the impact of Waffen-SS veterans in post-war German society continues, and a number of books on the subject have been published in recent years. In post-war Germany Political influence Like with the myth of the clean Wehrmacht, the erroneous perception that the Wehrmacht was not involved in war crimes and atrocities during World War II, a similar perception existed about the Waffen- SS, in parts driven by its former members. Efforts were made to portray the Waffen-SS as a fourth arm of the Wehrmacht and to shift all blame of war crimes and the Holocaust to the other branches of the SS, thereby portraying Waffen-SS men as \\"soldiers like any other\\" (). This view was supported and advocated by high-profile conservative politicians in post-war West Germany. Konrad Adenauer, Chancellor of Germany at the time, stated in 1953 in front of members of his party, the Christian Democratic Union, that: > The men of the Waffen-SS were soldiers like everybody else ... try to > explain to other countries that the Waffen-SS had no connections with the > Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo! Try to explain to people that the Waffen-SS > has not shot any Jews, but instead was a formation of soldiers that was most > feared by the Soviets. Franz Josef Strauss, West Germany's then-Minister of Defence, a World War II veteran, stated in a letter to HIAG in March 1957: \\"I think you know how I personally think about the front line units of the Waffen-SS. They are included in my admiration for the German soldiers of the last world war.\\" Adenauer's statement that the Waffen-SS were soldiers like everybody else inspired former high-ranking commander of the Waffen-SS Paul Hausser to use this statement as a title for his book, Soldaten wie andere auch: Der Weg der Waffen-SS (Soldiers like any other: The Path of the Waffen-SS). HIAG HIAG made efforts to appeal to the mainstream parties on the right and left in the 1950s and claimed to represent up to 2,000,000 potential voters in West Germany. In reality, only 250,000 former Waffen-SS veterans lived in the country and only eight percent of those were members of HIAG. In the early 1960s HIAG made a shift to extreme right-wing politics, abandoning the facade of its members being reformed Nazis, after it realised it achieved all it could through its association with mainstream politics. By the early 1980s, Germany mainstream parties had all banned membership for HIAG members. The political influence of HIAG resulted in a number of Waffen-SS veterans receiving the same pensions as Wehrmacht veterans. Waffen-SS and the Bundeswehr The issue of Waffen-SS veterans in German society came to a head when Germany rearmed and formed the Bundeswehr in 1955. The initial intention was not to admit any former Waffen-SS men, but this was soon changed to allow former members up to the rank of Obersturmbannf√ºhrer (lieutenant colonel). Public opinion was split on the subject, as many people in Germany had suffered under the Nazi regime, too, while many others had voluntarily or involuntarily been members of Nazi organisations like the SS. The exclusion of former Waffen-SS men was criticised by HIAG who attempted to draw a distinction between the \\"honourable\\" Waffen-SS and \\"evil\\" Allgemeine-SS, notwithstanding the fact that up to 60,000 Waffen-SS men had also served with the SS in the concentration and extermination camps. The admittance of former Waffen-SS personnel to the new Bundeswehr created some unease with the former Allied powers, Britain, France and the US. Germany received a conditional approval from the United States Department of State for the admittance of former Waffen-SS personnel into the armed forces on the grounds that the number of applications was small and the selection process would be careful. It clarified its position after a question by the American Jewish Committee as to how much such a step would impact the democratic nature of the new German armed forces. From the German side, rejecting the former SS members was seen as politically dangerous as the estimated 500,000 Waffen-SS veterans, a number later found to be too high, were too large a group to be ignored as potential voters. HIAG and Waffen-SS veterans were not just courted by the conservative German government; opposition leader Kurt Schumacher also remained on good terms with the organisation. The number of applications from former Waffen-SS men for the new Bundeswehr remained low, with 3,117 applications received by September 1956, of which 508 were accepted, 33 of those being officers. Despite the promised screening process, at least one member of the Allgemeine- SS was approved, Major Ulrich Besch, who had been a guard at the Buchenwald concentration camp. Overall the number of former Waffen-SS members in the Bundeswehr never exceeded 770. By comparison, the same screening of former SS members was not applied to the Federal Criminal Police Office, where 33 out of the 57 leading officials were former members of the SS. Secret army In 2014 files of the German intelligence service, the Bundesnachrichtendienst, were declassified and revealed that 2,000 former officers of the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS in 1949 formed a 40,000 men secret army in West Germany, the Schnez- Truppe. The driving force behind this secret force was Albert Schnez, later the Inspector of the Army, who planned to arm it with weapons from the police. The German government became aware of the organisation in 1951 and tasked the predecessor organisation of the Bundesnachrichtendienst, the Gehlen Organization, with monitoring the activities, but otherwise took little action. The declassified files, reviewed by German historian , grandson of Albert Kesselring, who is part of an independent commission to study the early history of the German intelligence service, also revealed that the secret army was tasked with spying on politicians of the opposition and, in case of an invasion by the Soviet Union, was to retreat to a neighbouring country and liberate Germany from there. In case of civil war it was tasked with neutralising communists in West Germany. The fate of this secret army after the formation of the Bundeswehr is unclear. What is known is that many former members, among them high-ranking NATO officials Adolf Heusinger and Hans Speidel, joined the new German armed forces. Commemoration controversies A visit to the Bitburg war cemetery by US President Ronald Reagan and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl sparked the Bitburg controversy, as the cemetery also contained 49 graves of the Waffen-SS men, members of the SS Division Das Reich. Kohl, who had come to power in 1982, had removed restrictions on Waffen-SS veteran gatherings and associations and de-listed them from the register of right-wing groups that were required to be watched by the German Ministry of the Interior. Three days after the Bitburg events, on the anniversary of the German surrender in 1945, veterans of the Leibstandarte, Hitler Youth and the Totenkopf divisions held reunions in Nesselwang, which drew international attention. Associations representing the victims of Nazism called for a ban of such gatherings, but no legal grounds could be found for such actions. The events attracted between 250 and 500 veterans from each division, but also protests by over 400 people from anti-fascist groups. In 1993 the commander of the German III Corps in Koblenz, Lieutenant General Klaus Reinhardt, was heavily criticised by high-ranking conservative politician Alfred Dregger for banning Bundeswehr soldiers from participating in a memorial service at a German war cemetery that also held the graves of fallen Waffen-SS soldiers on Volkstrauertag. Reinhardt argued that he meant no disrespect to the young soldiers that had died for Germany but found that the ideology of the Waffen-SS was incompatible with the values of democracy. Commemorations for fallen Waffen-SS soldiers continue to this day and attract some controversy in Germany as these are often associated with the Neo Nazi scene. Speeches and songs often include themes from the Nazi era but participants can only be prosecuted if these include banned material. Notable veterans A number of former Waffen-SS members achieved success in post-war Germany, not all of them disclosing their past. G√ºnter Grass, who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1999, only admitted in 2006 that he joined the SS in 1944. Actor Hardy Kr√ºger was conscripted to the Waffen-SS in 1945, having started in propaganda movies before that, but was almost executed for refusing to fire on American troops and admitted his past early on in his career. Another prominent German actor, Horst Tappert, kept his past secret and only five years after his death was it made public that he had served in the SS Division Totenkopf from 1942. East German painter Bernhard Heisig who volunteered for the SS in 1942, admitted his past early and joined the communist party after the war. Journalist and Waffen-SS volunteer Franz Sch√∂nhuber spent 35 years working for mainstream Bavarian newspapers and the Bayerischer Rundfunk, Bavarian state television, before his autobiography in 1981 saw him dismissed from his role for diminishing Nazi crimes, after which he turned to right-wing politics where he enjoyed moderate success. Research While literature about the Waffen-SS and its performance during the war in post-war Germany was plentiful, some of it extremely uncritical, research into the organisation's influence in post-war Germany is less extensive. German historian published Die SS. Geschichte und Verbrechen in 2015 which, in its final chapter, deals with the post-war years and the trials and career paths of former members. Two German historians, and , published Die SS nach 1945: Entschuldungsnarrative, popul√§re Mythen, europ√§ische Erinnerungsdiskurse in 2018, which deals with the post-war trials and the influence and connections former Waffen-SS veterans enjoyed in Germany. It also touches on the attempts to mythologise the Waffen-SS and the attempts to change its perception in popular culture. Modern research in Germany has come to the conclusion that, from a military point of view, the impact of the Waffen-SS has been greatly exaggerated. According to Bastian Hein, the author of Die SS. Geschichte und Verbrechen (The SS: History and Crime), associated with the German Chancellery, the Waffen-SS was not an elite formation, given that at any one time it had no more than 370,000 members. This accounted for just four percent of the strength of the German armed forces during World War II, and that it made virtually no contribution in the first years of the war, when Germany was generally victorious. He argues that the fanaticism of the SS led to high losses but limited military success. According to historian George Stein, the Waffen-SS never obtained total \\"independence of command\\", nor was it ever a \\"serious rival\\" to the German Army. Even though it underwent rapid war-time expansion, even at its peak the Waffen-SS remained under 10% of the Wehrmacht.

The British Chiefs of Staff Committee ordered at that time that the Mediterranean Fleet was to be divided into two commands; one responsible for naval operations involving ships, and the other administrative and support, responsible for shore establishments. His subordinate establishments, and staff were sometimes informally known as the Levant Command or Levant Station, In December 1943 the title was changed to Flag Officer, Levant and East Mediterranean. In January 1944 the two separate commands were re-unified into a single command with FOLEM merging back into Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Fleet. History Shore-based naval area commands in the Mediterranean and Middle East theatre had historically reported to the Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Fleet. In 1940, responsibility for the Red Sea area was transferred from the Commander- in-Chief, East Indies to the Mediterranean Fleet and did not revert until 1942. Following a meeting in London, the Chiefs of Staff Committee signaled on 2 February 1943 to Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, that: > 1). The Mediterranean will be divided into two commands:(a) the area to the > west line A to B to be the Mediterranean command. (b) the area to the East > of the above line to be the Levant command which will include the Red Sea. > 2). For the present the line A to B will be the line running from the > Tunisian/Tripolitanian border to a position in Latitude 35 degrees North, > Longitude 60 degrees East, thence to Cape Spartivento (Italy). Between 1943 and 1945 the shore commands reporting to C-in-C Levant were Tunisia (1943); North Africa, (1943-1944), Sicily (July‚ÄìSeptember 1943); Taranto September 1943- May 1945; FO West Italy September 1943-October 1944; Northern Mediterranean October 1944, and Western Mediterranean (January 1943- January 1944 & July 1944 -1945). The dockyards at Gibraltar and Malta continued as major bases supporting the new organisation. In December 1943 the command was renamed Levant and Eastern Mediterranean. In August 1946 the command was retitled the Flag Officer, Middle East, part of the tri-service British Middle East Command, until 1959. Commanders in Chief {  ! !! Rank !! Flag !! Name !!

A native of Painesville, Ohio, Stage attended Western Reserve University, where he tied an amateur world record in the 100-yard dash. After briefly becoming a National League baseball umpire in 1894, he finished law school and became a private practice attorney. Stage served in the Ohio House of Representatives in 1902‚Äì03 before returning to law practice. In the early 20th century, Stage was an ally of Cleveland mayor Tom L. Johnson, and he held several local government posts. He was the Cuyahoga County Solicitor, ran the Municipal Traction Company, and served as Cleveland's public safety director and utilities director. His law practice largely consisted of representing railroad and real estate barons O. P. and M. J. Van Sweringen (known as the Van Sweringen brothers). Stage was married to Miriam Kerruish, one of the first women to practice medicine in Cleveland. She died in the Cleveland Clinic fire of 1929. Stage retired after the Van Sweringen brothers lost their fortune in the Great Depression. He was sometimes known as Billy Stage, particularly in collegiate athletics and in baseball circles. Early life Adelbert College of Western Reserve football team Stage was born in Painesville, Ohio. His father, Stephen K. Stage, was a butcher, and his mother was named Sarah Knight Stage. The second of three sons, Charles Stage lived in Painesville his entire childhood, graduating from Painesville High School in 1888. Stage's parents were against his desire to go to college, so, at least in the beginning, he had to work to pay his tuition at Adelbert College of Western Reserve (later known as Case Western Reserve University). Still, he ran track, played baseball and captained the first varsity football team the college fielded. At a track meet in 1890, Stage won seven events, and in six of those events he posted the best time of any college student in Ohio that year. The Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) did not recognize athletic events at Western Reserve at the time Stage enrolled; he was first allowed to compete in AAU events in 1892, the year he finished an undergraduate degree. In 1893, Stage received a master's degree, also from Western Reserve. Later that year, Stage, by that time a Western Reserve law student, tied a world record by running the 100-yard dash in 9.8 seconds at an AAU event. Umpiring career In April 1894, Stage was still studying law when he was hired by the National League to serve as a professional baseball umpire. During a time when umpires worked by themselves, Stage's speed allowed him to get good views of the plays anywhere on the field. Infielder Hughie Jennings recalled that Stage might even slide next to a runner if he thought it would give him a better angle to make a close call. After his umpiring debut, The Pittsburgh Press noted that he offered \\"a relief from the usual lazy style of umpiring.\\" Umpires in that era, however, were often not appreciated; they faced threats of physical violence, and turnover was high. Cleveland Spiders manager Patsy Tebeau later described how players often ran after the umpire to attack him at the end of a game. He recalled that Stage's speed made him the most frustrating umpire to chase. \\"The whole team took after him time and again, but never once did he fail to get over the back fence ahead of us. We could never catch him. Finally I protested to President Young and Stage resigned,\\" Tebeau said. Stage dealt with unspecified illnesses several times that year, and whether or not Tebeau had a role in it, Stage cited poor health when he resigned in July 1894 after umpiring 45 games. Over the next year he returned to the field to umpire five times, all in Cleveland, but he did not umpire after 1895. Stage participated in a few AAU track events in the fall of 1895 before he was declared ineligible because of his prior work as a professional baseball umpire. He turned his attention to studying for the bar exam at that point. Law and public service After finishing law school as a member of the first graduating class of the Western Reserve School of Law in 1895, Stage opened a private law practice in Cleveland. He met Cleveland's Democratic mayor, Tom L. Johnson, and began to take an increased interest in politics. Through Johnson, Stage met the Cleveland railroad barons known as the Van Sweringen brothers, and this helped him make important contacts within politics and outside of it. In at least one case, Stage helped the brothers make a connection, facilitating their introduction to city solicitor Newton D. Baker, who became Cleveland's mayor and the United States Secretary of War. The Van Sweringens were making plans to develop a garden community like the one found at Roland Park in Baltimore, and they had a politically diverse group of financial backers. Stage remembered not being convinced when he heard O. P. Van Sweringen's pitch the first time. \\"He was so doggone timid about the matter that when he left I remarked 'That young man will never make a real estate salesman.'\\" Returning later, O. P. Van Sweringen spent several hours laying out his plans for Stage, and this convinced Stage to become a financial supporter of the project. Stage served as a Democratic member of the Ohio House of Representatives in 1902 and 1903. In April 1902, Stage argued for the passage of a resolution that allowed Ohioans to vote on whether the governor should have veto power. The measure passed the House; it was approved by voters the following year, giving the Governor of Ohio the most extreme veto power in the United States. After Stage left the Ohio House of Representatives, he was counsel for the Van Sweringen brothers for several years. He served on the boards of directors for several entities, including the Cleveland Union Terminal, later known as Tower City Center. He was also a close advisor to Mayor Johnson and served as Cuyahoga County Solicitor and director of the Municipal Traction Company, which was the holding company for the Cleveland railway system. Stage left city politics after Johnson did not win re-election in 1909, but he returned to city service under a Democratic mayor in 1911, taking posts as Cleveland's director of public safety and then as the first city utilities director. Personal life In 1903, Stage married a physician, Miriam Gertrude Kerruish, and they had four children. Kerruish practiced as an obstetrician and pediatrician, and many of her patients were indigent. She was one of the first women to practice medicine in Cleveland and was the first woman credentialed to practice at Cleveland City Hospital. Kerruish's father William was the son of immigrants from the Isle of Man and, like Stage, had worked his way through Western Reserve to become a lawyer. Miriam Kerruish's brother, Sheldon Quayle Kerruish, was also an attorney. Miriam Kerruish was also active in civic organizations. She helped organize the Women‚Äôs Protective Association of Cleveland and was on the board of trustees of the Woman‚Äôs Hospital and the Maternity Hospital Council. She died in the Cleveland Clinic fire of 1929. A few years after his wife's death, Stage inherited a large tract of land from the Kerruish family located in what is now known as Cleveland's Lee‚ÄìMiles neighborhood. Stage donated the land to the city and Kerruish Park was established. He retired when the Great Depression destroyed the Van Sweringens' holdings and he died in 1946, never having remarried.

The ADA enables vehicles, missiles and other platforms equipped with the smart antenna to navigate even when heavy jamming is conducted in order to block all reception of GPS and other GNSS signals. Using advanced techniques even very faint \\"good\\" signals are being extracted from the superposition of incoming waves that include noise and strong signals produced by the enemy (or friendly) jammers. These signals are then used (just like a regular GPS receiver) to triangulate the position and determine the GPS tune.  History  The theory of the ADA started to emerge as a theory of multichannel estimation. Its origins go back into methods developed in the 1920s that were used to determine direction of the arrival of radio signals by a set of two antennas based on the phase difference or amplitudes of their output voltages. Thus, the assessment of the directions of arrival of a single signal was conducted according to pointed type indicator readings or according to the Lissajous curves, drawn by beam on the oscilloscope screen.Slyusar V.

It has up to fifteen dull greenish, pinkish or brownish flowers with red lines and a labellum with a purplish \\"beard\\", but is leafless. Description Calochilus pruinosus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber but is leafless. Up to fifteen dull greenish, pinkish or brownish flowers with red lines are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is oblong to egg- shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are long and wide. The petals are broad egg-shaped and a similar size to the dorsal sepal. The labellum is curved, long and wide and has up to six dark purple plates with a metallic lustre near its base. The middle part of the laballum has scattered bristly hairs up to long and the tip has a glandular \\"tail\\" about long. The column has two purple \\"eyes\\" joined by a faint ridge. The flowers have a cupped appearance, only last two or three days and are thought to be self- pollinating. Flowering occurs from August to October. Taxonomy and naming Calochilus pruinosus was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research from a specimen collected near Hopetoun. The specific epithet (pruinosus) is a Latin word meaning \\"frosty\\" or \\"rimy\\". Distribution and habitat The mallee beard orchid grows in woodland in coastal areas between Hopetoun and Eyre in the Esperance Plains and Hampton biogeographic regions. Conservation As of 2011, C. pruinosus is only known from three sites near Hopetoun, although there are historical records from south of the Stirling Range and near Eyre. The species is classified as \\"critically endangered\\" under the Western Australian Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. The main threats to the species are habitat degradation, habitat loss and inappropriate fire regimes.

The massacre  During the first days of August 1944, the section of Marsza≈Çkowska Street enclosed by Chmielna and Z≈Çota Streets was not overtaken by major insurgent fights.Szymon Datner, Kazimierz Leszczy≈Ñski (red.): Zbrodnie okupanta w czasie powstania warszawskiego w 1944 roku (w dokumentach).

On August 3rd, around 11:00 a.m., a German armored car arrived there and started shooting at surrounding houses while driving north on Marsza≈Çkowska Street. The vehicle then stopped in front of tenement house no. 113, where a small group of soldiers got out. They entered the courtyard of the tenement house and then went to the grounds of the neighbouring house number 111.The building, which does not exist today, was located approximately at the crossroads of Marsza≈Çkowska Street and Chmielna Street, in the area of the present Parade Square. According to Piotr Grzywacz, an inhabitant of that house, the unit consisted of one German and eight \\"Ukrainians\\"The collaborators from the eastern voluntary formations who suppressed Warsaw were collectively described by the inhabitants of the capital as \\"Ukrainians\\" or \\"Kalmyks\\", and these terms most often appear in their recollections. This was largely due to the impression that information about crimes committed by Ukrainian nationalists in Kresy Wschodnie had evoked throughout Poland. In reality, Ukrainian troops did not participate much in the uprising fights. So it is difficult to determine the nationality of these collaborators. In this case, they could indeed have been Ukrainians from the SS auxiliary units located in Szucha Avenue.

About 40 people listened to the order. The soldiers gathered everyone in front of the \\"Pod ≈öwiate≈Çkami\\" tavern and shot them with machine guns.Maja Motyl, Stanis≈Çaw Rutkowski: Powstanie Warszawskie ‚Äì rejestr miejsc i fakt√≥w zbrodni.

According to Piotr Grzywacz, there were 37 victims. Maja Motyl and Stanis≈Çaw Rutkowski, authors of the study \\"Warsaw Uprising - the register of places and facts of crime\\", assessed the number of people killed at 44. The victims of the massacre were residents of houses at Marsza≈Çkowska Street: 109, 111, 113. Women and children were among the murdered. After the murder, the German sub-unit tried to leave the tenement house, but it was prevented from doing so by insurgent fire from the \\"Metropol\\" hotel building. (Marsza≈Çkowska St., corner of Z≈Çota St.). The Germans stayed in the house for the next day. On August 4th, an assault section from the staff unit of the Warsaw Home Army District broke into the tenement house, where they captured two \\"Ukrainians\\", the remaining SS men were killed during the exchange of fire.Witness Piotr Grzywacz claimed that two insurgents died in the battle, but in the \\"≈Åaszcz\\" report there is not a single word about it.

In 1931, she negotiated to have the Central City Opera House donated to the university. Early life and education Ida Kruse was born in Central City - Black Hawk area in 1872. Her parents were Frederick and Letta Kruse. She had an sister, Clara, and a brother named Frederick. Her father was the major of Central City, where she grew up and attended a convent school, St. Aloysius. McFarlane received her Bachelor of Arts and Masters of Arts degrees from Vassar College and studied in Europe at various universities. She received an honorary Doctorate of Literature from the University of Denver in 1914. Career She began her work career as Ida Kruse and around 1907 she married Frederick McFarlane, a mining manufacturer who was born and educated in Central City. Between 1903 and 1907, McFarlane was Superintendent of schools for Gilpin County, Colorado. University of Denver campus She taught English during the 1905-1906 summer interim at the University of Denver and formally joined the university's English faculty in 1907. She taught English literature and served as head of the English Department until her death in 1940. She taught modern poetry, drama, the French language, Spanish literature, and phonetics. She was particularly interested in the works of Ezra Pound, Carl Sandburg, and T. S. Eliot. She offered and taught courses in manners and, with a colleague, created seven courses on efficiency, called Scientific Management in 1914. The area of knowledge was led by the works of Frank and Lillian Gilbreth and Frederick Winslow Taylor. Central City Opera House In 1931, she negotiated for the donation of the Central City Opera House to the University of Denver, with Peter McFarlane and the heirs of the opera house. It was a logical choice based upon the university's affiliation with the Civic Theater and its tax- exempt status. She had the support of philanthropist Anne Evans, the daughter of Governor John Evans. The building was renovated and opened in 1932 and began a tradition of the Central City Summer Festival. She gave public lecturers about literature and art by 1914. In 1919, she published Modern Culture, the Arts of the Theatre, a compilation of her lectures. With Melicent Van Riper, she co-authored The Glory that was Gold: The Central City Opera House. Personal life In 1937, McFarlane and her husband bought the Georgian-style house (1898) built by railroad attorney Daniel W. Tears. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Tears-McFarlane House. She died on June 18, 1940. Legacy * In 1944, a monument was built in Central City in her honor, at the initial suggestion of Anne Evans. A fund for the monument was raised by Clarence H. Adams, who at the time was the president of the International Trust Company. * Due to her dedication to the university, the Johnson-McFarlane Residential Hall was partially named after her.

Users pay a recurring fee for the right to use a car with insurance, maintenance, tax, MOT and breakdown coverage, and can swap vehicles during the subscription or to cancel their subscriptions outright.  History  Drover was founded in late 2015 by Felix Leuschner, previously CEO of a fashion platform Sylistpick and virtual goods market Gamegoods, and Matt Varughese. They had observed that most of the innovation in the mobility space had been focused on how to get from A to B but that very little had been done around car ownership itself. In March 2018 Drover received funding of ¬£5.5m from investors including BP Ventures, Partech Ventures and Cherry Ventures. This was on top of a ¬£2m pre- seed investment. In April 2018 Drover partnered with BMW Group to provide BMW and Mini vehicles on the platform.  Service  Drover does not own any cars, but provides a marketplace for vehicle subscriptions. Users pay a monthly fee for a car, including insurance, breakdown cover, maintenance tax and MOT. There are no long term commitments so users can swap, upgrade, downgrade or cancel their subscriptions. Felix Leuschner, CEO, claims that by providing a more seamless, online and all-inclusive experience, Drover will be able to improve the typical car purchasing experience.

They have been ascribed the same importance of the Talmud to Judaism by Jivanji Jamshedji Modi. The word Revayat has disputed etymology. Some claim the word to have origins from Arabic but this is contentious. Overview The content of each Revayat varies but they are usually queries on matters of worship, customs, rituals and observance. The issues range form the mundane, such as queries about the preparation of ink for the writing of religious documents, to important issues including conversion. Over three centuries, twenty-two Revayats were sent from India to Persia. The first Revayat was brought in 1478 AD by Nariman Hoshang of Broach. Hoshang was a layman, supported by Chang Asa a notable leader of the Navsari Parsi community. Hoshang spent a year in Yazd, learning Persian and supported himself by 'petty trade'. Eventually his Persian improved to the extent that he was able to question the dasturs of Iran. After this initial Revayat, Indian priests would gather up questions and send representatives to Iran with the questions. These Revayats are known by the emissary who brought them back. Some Revayats are anonymous as the person who brought them is unknown, these Rivatays are more or less incomplete. In the 17th Century the Revayats were classified according to the subject they pertained to by Hormazdyar Framarz, Darab Hormazdyar, and Barzo Kamdin. The Revayats are notable as the only Modern Persian text composed in the Avestan script. During the 18th Century the Kadmi sects in both Iran and India exchanged additional Revayats, which culminated in the Revayat-e Haftad va Hast (translated as the Revayat of 78 Questions) (also known as the Ithoter Revayat).

The price depends on the location of the specific event. The race is open to anyone over the age of 18. The participation package includes obligatory health insurance coverage. The participants are usually grouped into teams, but it is possible to race one on one. Everyone who contributes to the race receives a commemorative tag on a steel chain. Starting from 2017, the tags can be engraved with a custom design. Over the years, the race has seen appearances of such celebrity guests as Mikhail Galustyan, Ksenia Sukhinova, Vyacheslav Malafeev, Artemy Lebedev, and Askold Zapashny, as well as Alla Mikheeva and Denis Lebedev.  Formats   HeroRace  The race covers two different location types: military training grounds (under the auspices of the Russian Ministry of Defense) and civilian facilities. Its program also includes special corporate days, encouraging the fee-based participation of business community representatives. The main feature of military-hosted races is the extensive use of blank shots and smoke screens for realistic battle simulation. The obstacle course challenges include crawling under a tank. By contrast, the civilian format of the cross- country race focuses on exploring Russia‚Äôs most scenic locations, from ski resorts to recreational parks, mountainsides and valleys. The challenges presented to the contestants are also diverse: monkey bars, climbing walls, army obstacle courses, spring boards, zip lines, and many others. The rules for passing the obstacles are unique for every location.   Winter HeroRace  Races of this format are held in winter at civilian locations. Their key feature is the use of obstacles built out of snow and ice. Over the years, the Winter Heroes events have been hosted at the following locations: * 2016‚Äîthe Otkritie Arena Stadium in Moscow.¬´–ì–æ–Ω–∫–∞ –≥–µ—Ä–æ–µ–≤¬ª –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç–∞–¥–∏–æ–Ω–µ ¬´–û—Ç–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏–µ –ê—Ä–µ–Ω–∞¬ª ‚Äî –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞24 * 2017‚Äîthe Mitino Landscape Park in Moscow and the Sheregesh Ski Resort in the Kemerovo Oblast.¬´–ì–æ–Ω–∫–∞ –≥–µ—Ä–æ–µ–≤¬ª: —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ö –∏ –Ω–µ–Ω–∞–≤–∏—Å—Ç—å –≤ –®–µ—Ä–µ–≥–µ—à–µ ‚Äî –°–∏–±–¥–µ–ø–æ * 2018‚Äîthe Krylatskoye Rowing Canal in Moscow and the–í –∑–∏–º–Ω–µ–π ¬´–ì–æ–Ω–∫–µ –≥–µ—Ä–æ–µ–≤¬ª –≤ –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–µ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è–ª–∏ —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∏–µ –±–æ–ª–µ–µ 2 —Ç—ã—Å. —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫ ‚Äî –¢–ê–°–° Igora Year-Round Resort in St. Petersburg.–ü–µ—Ä–≤–∞—è –∑–∏–º–Ω—è—è ¬´–ì–æ–Ω–∫–∞ –≥–µ—Ä–æ–µ–≤¬ª –≤ –ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥–µ —Å–æ–±—Ä–∞–ª–∞ 2 —Ç—ã—Å—è—á–∏ —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ ‚Äî –§–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–Ω–∫–∞.—Ä—É Over 7,000 people have taken part in the winter race throughout the format‚Äôs history.1,5 —Ç—ã—Å—è—á–∏ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫ —Ä–µ—à–∏–ª–∏ –ø—Ä–æ–π—Ç–∏ ¬´–ì–æ–Ω–∫—É –≥–µ—Ä–æ–µ–≤¬ª –≤ —Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–∞ ‚Äî 360  Night HeroRace  This version of the extreme obstacle race is held at night.

The race has a few specific must-have features, such as light shows, torches, and glow-in-the-dark markings.  HeroRace. Children  The children‚Äôs version of the HeroRace debuted in 2015 at the Vorobyovy Gory Pioneers Palace in Moscow. Over 500 children took part in the event. During the next 2 years, the project stagnated, due to difficulties with arranging events for minors. Starting from 2018, the Little HeroRace has been brought back as part of the classical Race, held on a separate obstacle course.  Winterhell  The first Winterhell Race, hosted by the Heroleague in the European Union, took place on January 20, 2018, at the N√ºrburgring race track in Germany. The event brought together approximately 1000 participants from a number of countries: Germany, Austria, Belgium, Russia, and several others.–†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–µ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—ã –≤ 2017 –≥–æ–¥—É –≤–ø–µ—Ä–≤—ã–µ –ø—Ä–æ–≤–µ–¥—É—Ç ¬´–ì–æ–Ω–∫—É –≥–µ—Ä–æ–µ–≤¬ª –≤ –ï–° ‚Äî –†–ò–ê –ù–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–∏ file:Gonka geroev 2.jpg  Mubarizler  The Mubarizler event in Baku, Azerbaijan, was first held in 2017 at the training centre of the local Ministry of Internal Affairs.

The timing of the race is tracked with the use of professional equipment. This event is also hosted both at military training grounds and civilian locations. There are 4 participation options: solo male, solo female, paired race, and team race. The process of passing the obstacle course is governed by special guidelines, which include a set of rules and penalty points for breaking these rules.

In 2017 they released their debut album Stargazing, quickly followed by a video single for the song Houses and a companion ep recorded live in 2018 titled Stargazing Live!. In April 2020 they released Bedtime Rituals, their second studio album. Their name is a tribute to the danish philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard. Style S√∏ren are often described as a cocktail of Dark Folk and New Wave and are usually compared to other Neofolk acts from Rome like Spiritual Front, but with more new wave influences. Other reviewers compared them to acts like My Bloody Valentine, Daughter and The XX and described them as electro-folk. Their songs are often described as \\"dark ballads\\", and they use a mix of almost-whispered male and strong female vocals.. Their second album Bedtime Rituals was compared to the gothic rock sound of The Sisters of Mercy, with epic and symphonic influences, almost fantasy-like. Collaborations Stargazing and Bedtime Rituals, S√∏ren's first two albums, are very collaborative works with more than ten musicians across the world working on them coming from different backgrounds and musical genres, from the singer- songwriter world of Joni Fuller and Mike Wyatt to the punk attitude of guitarist Matt LeFevers and the metal background of drummer Siros Vaziri. Album covers The cover art of Stargazing was digitally painted by Daniele Piscitello, lead animator of the videogame The Wardrobe. The same cover was edited by filmmaker Antonio La Camera, also director of the Houses music video and award winner with his short Flesh and Dust, to be used for Stargazing Live!. Bedtime Rituals, S√∏ren second studio album, features a cover painted by Martyna \\"Outstar\\" Zych, animator on The Witcher 3, lead designer of Cold Hearts and twitch streamer. Works on the cover was live-streamed on twitch and now it is featured on the band official YouTube channel.

History  A painting on this subject had originally been commissioned from Juan Fern√°ndez Navarrete by Philip II of Spain as an altarpiece dedicated to Saint Maurice and his Theban Legion. After Navarrete's death in 1579, Philip transferred the commission to El Greco,Scholz, p√°g. 40. who had recently established himself in Toledo.

Description of painting  Maurice is shown in a blue breastplate and red tunic in the right foreground, surrounded by the officers of his legion while they decide whether to sacrifice to the pagan gods or accept martyrdom. To Maurice's left Saint Exuperius holds a red banner. Next to him is a bearded man in a tunic, identified as James the Less, who had converted the whole of Maurice's legion to Christianity. Between Maurice and the banner-bearer are two figures modelled on Spanish soldiers of the time - the elder one is Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, commander of the Spanish troops at the Battle of St. Quentin in 1557 and Grand Master of the Military Order of Saint Maurice. To Emmanuel's right (closer to Maurice) is Alessandro Farnese, then fighting against the Dutch Republic. The martyrdom occurs in the left background, including a figure modelled on Charles V's illegitimate son Don John of Austria, victor of the battle of Lepanto. In the left upper background angels wait to welcome the martyrs into heaven.

History Timothy Warner was born in 1819 in Livonia, New York, and came with his parents to Brighton Township from in 1837 as a pioneer. However, the Panic of 1837 made it difficult profitably purchase farmland, and Warner began by farming land on shares. However, in 1841, he purchased 80 acres of land at this site. Although it had been owned by a number of speculators previously, the land was undeveloped at the time. He constructed a log cabin and several barns. In 1846, Timothy married Lucretia Jones of South Lyon and started a family. In 1855, the couple built the Greek Revival home that is still located on the farmstead. The Warner farm was successful, and by 1859 the Warners owned 240 acres, and later owned nearly 600 acres. In 1900, Timothy's son George inherited the farm, and in 1920 George's son Herbert purchased it. Herbert added more structures to the farmstead, including a new barn and well house. The farm continued to run self-sufficiently until 1962, when Herbert decided to retire. In 1980, Herbert's son Leroy inherited the homestead and the surrounding 18 acres, with other portions of the original claim being subdivided. All of the older outbuildings were removed in 2002. Substantial restoration work on the house began in 2015. Description Although at one time a number of structures were located on the Warner Homestead, the only remaining original structure is the 1855 farmhouse. The house is a Greek Revival Upright and Wing structure, consisting of a two-story gable front upright along with a single story lateral wing on a foundation of mortared fieldstone. An architrave and frieze topped with cornice runs around all sides. The house is clad with lapped siding terminating in cornerboards. The main door is located in the center of the gable-front section, and is flanked with piers and topped with an entablature. A recessed porch runs across the front of the wing, between the upright section and a projecting room at the opposite end. A second recessed porch is located in the rear. The relocated Hicks schoolhouse also stands on the property. It is an 1849 schoolhouse which originally was located at the corner of M-36 and Farley Roar near Pinckney, Michigan. It is a wood-framed Greek Revival one-room schoolhouse. The school served students in its original location until 1972, and was moved to the curreny location in 2016. Archaeology The Warner Homestead has been designated an archaeological site, known as the Warner Site or 20LV334. Archaeological digs began on the site in 2007. Subsequent excavation uncovered 21 documented archaeological features, and the recovery of thousands of artifacts. These are primarily privies and trash pits with late nineteenth and early twentieth century household artifacts.

Warszawa: wydawnictwo MON, 1962. p. 116-117 The barracks began to serve as a makeshift prison and at the same time as a gathering point for the expelled residents of the district. It operated until approximately mid-September 1944, although many Poles were kept in barracks until the beginning of October. After a longer or shorter stay in Stauferkaserne, the prisoners were usually sent to the transit camp in Pruszk√≥w or other assembly points set up by the Germans for the expelled population of Warsaw.Szymon Datner, Kazimierz Leszczy≈Ñski (red.): Zbrodnie okupanta w czasie powstania warszawskiego w 1944 roku (w dokumentach). Warszawa: wydawnictwo MON, 1962. p. 112-119  Living conditions of prisoners  The first group of men expelled to Stauferkaserne received food and drinks only the next day, and some of them received it three days after their detention. Starting on August 5 or so, the Germans allowed Polish women to bring food to relatives imprisoned in the barracks. However, there were several cases when SS men opened fire for no reason on women walking under the white flag. Several women were killed or wounded at that time.Szymon Datner, Kazimierz Leszczy≈Ñski (red.): Zbrodnie okupanta w czasie powstania warszawskiego w 1944 roku (w dokumentach).

At 5:30 a.m. there was a wake-up call, followed by an assembly. After the assembly, the prisoners were given breakfast, which usually consisted of 1-2 biscuits and black coffee. The prisoners worked until lunchtime at 1:00 p.m. Usually, they were given a portion of cooked groats as a meal. Later, the prisoners returned to work, which lasted until 7:00 p.m., when the two-hour break for supper began. Afterwards, the prisoners worked until 2:00 a.m.Szymon Datner, Kazimierz Leszczy≈Ñski (red.): Zbrodnie okupanta w czasie powstania warszawskiego w 1944 roku (w dokumentach). Warszawa: wydawnictwo MON, 1962. p. 110 The work performed by the prisoners included cleaning latrines with bare hands, dismantling insurgent barricades, cleaning tanks, burial of corpses, earthworks on the barracks (e.g. digging up communication ditches), cleaning streets, moving and loading goods robbed by the Germans onto cars. Many of these works were aimed only at the exhaustion and humiliation of the detainees. The SS from the Stauferkaserne crew tormented the prisoners at every opportunity. Continuous beating was a common occurrence.Szymon Datner, Kazimierz Leszczy≈Ñski (red.): Zbrodnie okupanta w czasie powstania warszawskiego w 1944 roku (w dokumentach). Warszawa: wydawnictwo MON, 1962. p. 111 The difficult living and working conditions soon led to the complete exhaustion of the prisoners. An epidemic of dysentery broke out among the Poles detained in Stauferkaserne. After some time, a group of people gathered around the inspector of the Polish Red Cross, Jan Wierzbicki, managed to force the Germans to create a sanitary unit consisting of Polish prisoners. Initially, it was composed of 16 members, but after some time it reached 60 members, including two doctors and two nurses. The sanitary department even had its own truck at its disposal. Apart from taking care of the prisoners, Stauferkaserne's sanitary staff also provided medical assistance to Poles living in the Mokot√≥w quarter, which was under German control (mainly in the area from Rakowiecka Street to Madali≈Ñskiego Street),More serious cases were referred to the makeshift hospital of the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary at Kazimierzowska Street or to the hospital at Chocimska Street. as well as buried the corpses of killed civilians and insurgents. On the other hand, health care personnel was strictly forbidden to help injured Poles who were suspected of taking part in the uprising.Les≈Çaw M. Bartelski: Mokot√≥w 1944. Warszawa: wydawnictwo MON, 1986. . p. 334-335  Executions in the Stauferkaserne  During the Warsaw Uprising, at least 100 residents of Mokot√≥w were murdered in Stauferkaserne. As early as August 3,Szymon Datner, Kazimierz Leszczy≈Ñski (red.): Zbrodnie okupanta w czasie powstania warszawskiego w 1944 roku (w dokumentach).

Bartelski: Mokot√≥w 1944. Warszawa: wydawnictwo MON, 1986. . p. 277 Among the killed was an Orthodox priest, whom the SS ordered to sing before being executed. The corpses were buried in the area of the Mokot√≥w prison opposite Stauferkaserne. The remaining prisoners were told that the execution was a retaliation for the alleged execution of 30 Volksdeutsche by the insurgents. On August 4 a group of about 40 men from a house located at the corner of Narbutta and Niepodleg≈Ço≈õci Streets was brought to Stauferkaserne. All of them were shot with machine guns in the courtyard of the barracks. The wounded were killed with pistols. Single executions, usually ordered by SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer Patz, often took place in the barracks.Szymon Datner, Kazimierz Leszczy≈Ñski (red.): Zbrodnie okupanta w czasie powstania warszawskiego w 1944 roku (w dokumentach). Warszawa: wydawnictwo MON, 1962. p. 123 Patz once ordered to shoot a man with an unpleasant face grimace (resulting from health reasons) that he considered to be a mockery.Szymon Datner, Kazimierz Leszczy≈Ñski (red.): Zbrodnie okupanta w czasie powstania warszawskiego w 1944 roku (w dokumentach). Warszawa: wydawnictwo MON, 1962. p. 117 When the prisoners started to rebel against the destructive manner of work, the SS hanged one of them in front of their companions for punishment. The execution was led by one of the most cruel SS men from the Stauferkaserne crew, SS-Rottenf√ºhrer Franckowiak. Moreover, some of the men imprisoned in the barracks were taken by Gestapo \\"kennels\\" in an unknown direction and all their traces disappeared. On August 9, among others, about 20-40 prisoners were taken away in this manner. On one day at the turn of August and September, nearly 70 men disappeared in a similar way. It is probable that the Poles taken by the Gestapo were executed in the ruins of the General Inspectorate of the Armed Forces or in other places of execution near the Sicherheitspolizei headquarters in Szucha Avenue. Women imprisoned in Stauferkasserne, on the other hand, were rushed forward as \\"living shields\\" in front of German tanks. On August 8 Patz sent a delegation of 100 women to Colonel \\"Daniel\\", commander of the Home Army in Mokot√≥w, with a categorical demand for capitulation, threatening to shoot all Poles imprisoned in Stauferkaserne in case of refusal. However, Patz did not succeed, as \\"Daniel\\" threatened to impose similar sanctions on Germans who had been taken captive.Les≈Çaw M. Bartelski: Mokot√≥w 1944. Warszawa: wydawnictwo MON, 1986. . p. 327  Epilogue  After the war, the buildings of the former Stauferkaserne still served as the seat of the General Staff of the Polish Army (it is located there to this day). The place of death of many inhabitants of Mokot√≥w has not been commemorated in any way. The SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer Martin Patz trial began in 1978 in the Cologne Court. He was tried primarily for the murder of 600 prisoners in Mokot√≥w prison at 37 Rakowiecka Street by SS men reporting to him on August 2, 1944. In February 1980 Patz was convicted and sentenced to 9 years in prison. Karl Misling, who was tried in the same trial, received a 4-year prison sentence.Friedo Sachser. Central Europe.

Her first feature film as a director, The White Girl (2017), co- directed with the Australian-Hong Kong cinematographer Christopher Doyle, premiered at the BFI London Film Festival. She also produced Doyle's Hong Kong Trilogy (2015), which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. Her Chinese name, ÁôΩÊµ∑, means \\"White Sea\\", the strongest of the waves.  Early life and education  Suen was born and raised in Hong Kong, a city that has been the inspiration and backdrop of her last two films. At eighteen, she moved to the United States to study at the University of Pennsylvania. She graduated in 2006 with a Bachelor of Arts in Comparative Literature, Political Science, East Asian Languages and Civilisation, and a Master of Arts in East Asian Languages and Civilisation, which means she completed four courses of study and two degrees in the typical four years it takes to earn an undergraduate degree. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa, summa cum laude, and was named Dean's Scholar, a distinction only given to nine members of her class. To her, the films are a \\"homecoming\\", a search for identity at a critical moment in her city's history and amid vast changes witnessed in Chinese society in the last two decades.  Career  In 2015, Suen produced Hong Kong Trilogy, a hybrid documentary directed by Doyle, which is a portrait of the city as told by three generations of real Hong Kong people interviewed over the course of one year: children, young people, and the elderly. She raised over US$100,000 on Kickstarter.com to fund the project. The film kicked off a busy festival run after its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. It was released in Hong Kong theatres on September 28, 2015, to mark the one-year anniversary of the Umbrella Movement, which was featured in the film. Upon its theatrical release in the United States, it was named \\"Film of the Week\\" by American magazine Film Comment, described by critic Jonathan Romney as a \\"three linked semi-documentary vignettes about a location close to the director‚Äôs heart‚Äîfeels as much a community project as a personal statement. It isn‚Äôt so much an example of the genre known as the ‚Äúcity symphony‚Äù‚Äîit's more like a city jam.\\" Suen then went on to direct her first feature film with Doyle, The White Girl, a love story set in the last fishing village of Hong Kong, starring Joe Odagiri and Angela Yuen. Described as a \\"tropical-noir fairytale\\", it is set against the backdrop of the fishermen's disappearing culture and way of life, which is considered a metaphor for the many changes happening in Hong Kong at the time. After its 2017 world premiere at the BFI London Film Festival, it screened as a special presentation at the Singapore International Film Festival where it was reported as \\"a very accomplished first feature from Suen, [heralding] the coming of a new director with the knowhow and potential to add truly unique offerings to Hong Kong‚Äôs film canon\\". It was nominated for a NETPAC award at the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival. The film was theatrically released in Hong Kong in 2017 and was released in Japan at the end of 2018.

Dozens of spin-out designs were provided to most major combat and tactical wheeled-vehicles program in production.  Purpose and plan  ARL monitored escalation in the lethality of threats encountered by forces deployed in Southwest Asia. For better and lighter protection from improvised explosive devices (IEDs), ARL developed weight reduction goals and started to explore practical technology options by the end of FY08. A partnership was formed between Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) and the MRAP Joint Program Office (JPO) that resulted in RDECOM accelerating the development of IED protective technology and JPO redirecting its set of original equipment manufacturers to add vehicle payload capacity. The overall requirement was that the introduction of armor production could not delay the deployment schedule of MRAP equipment to theater. The program's combined technical approach was to exploit computing and terminal effects experimentation to scale known technologies for the defeat of IED threats; understand the most viable armor mechanisms for efficient penetrator defeat; and then introduce light-weight composites, new materials and enhanced ballistic mechanisms to reduce the add- on weight of final armor packages. The technical challenge to RDECOM was that technology originally envisioned as high-risk for a one-year developmental program, was now required to be production-ready within five months. The MAWRS program generated dozens of armor designs to counter explosively formed penetrator threats, improving protection for a variety of ground systems.  Results  Improvements include the Stryker family of vehicles. Using ARL's Defense Supercomputing Resource Center for supercomputing, materials research, on-site fabrication and live fire exercises at experimental facilities, expedient crew protection solutions for the Stryker were developed using advanced armor materials and improvements in energy absorption for crew seating. These technologies were transitioned to General Dynamics Land Systems for kit production and fielding. The MAWRS program was recognized by United States Army Materiel Command as the ‚ÄúTop Ten Great Inventions of 2008.‚Äù References Category:Armoured fighting vehicles ","title":"MRAP Armor Weight Reduction Spiral (MAWRS) Program"},{"id":"57818921","text":"Milan Miriƒá (born 21 March 1999) is a Bosnian footballer who plays as a defender for FK Zlatibor ƒåajetina in Serbian First League.

It was created by meltwater from a glacier carving the narrow valley. Water still flows through the dale and is known as Pickering Beck. The dale starts between Goathland Moor and Lockton High Moor where water runs southwards towards Pickering. In its upper reaches, the dale is very twisting and deep with the floor of the dale being above sea level. The dale is spelt either Newtondale or Newton Dale. Ordnance Survey maps and the North York Moors Railway refer to it as Newton Dale. History The dale was carved out by a massive amount of water charging through it in the last Ice Age. At the start of the twentieth century, Percy Kendall suggested that several massive glacial lakes at what is now the watershed between Eller Beck, the River Derwent and Pickering Beck effectively dammed the water and it was released at a torrent to carve the dale. It has been estimated that a few decades worth of water running through the dale carved it out, spilling the displaced earth into Lake Pickering. The flow of water is believed to have been per second; ten times the amount of water discharged by the River Thames when it is in flood. Kendall's original theory about massive pre-glacial lakes has been cast in doubt by modern research; many now believe that the ice sheets themselves just melted and released the water rather than the ice sheets holding back water in huge lakes. However, everyone agrees that the dale is an oddity as the water flowing through Pickering Beck down the dale does not have the power needed to carve out the narrow valley, which is above sea level on the valley floor with steep walls at up to at the crest. At certain points the narrow valley is only across. Killing Nab Scar, a cliff face in the wood just to the north of Newton Dale railway station, was formerly a place where the farmers of Goathland were, according to the terms of their tenancy, obliged to breed, raise and train hawks for royal use. The upper part of the dale was largely untouched by humans until the 1830s when the Whitby to Pickering Railway was built through it. However, the road between Pickering and Whitby used to go through Farwath and Levisham before it was diverted further east (now the A169). The railway builders used bundles of wood, sheep fleeces and spoil to float the railway across Fen Bog. At the head of the dale, where water either goes to Eller Beck (and then the Murk Esk then the River Esk) or Pickering Beck, is a bog (Fen Bog) which is managed by the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust. The bog is deep in places and is a Special Area of Conservation on account of the grasses and butterflies which are resident there. The area was gifted to the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust in 1964 in memory of two servicemen killed in the Second World War. The Lyke Wake Walk also crosses the bog. The dale was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1955 due to the varied plant and wildlife that it supports across wetland, woodland and bogland. Its glacial history is also a feature in the designation. In 2015, a flood reservoir and over 160 leaky dams were built in the dale's lower reaches after Pickering was flooded four times between 1999 and 2007. The last flood caused ¬£7 million worth of damage to the town. Transport There is no road access into the dale in its upper reaches, only parking at the fringes and walking in. The North York Moors Railway have two stations in the dale; and . Up until 2011, there was a forest drive road between the villages of Levisham and Stape, but the Forestry Commission closed the route because of landslips, prohibitive repair costs and to preserve the ecology of the dale due to its SSSI status. Newtondale Horse Trail[sic] is a long distance walkers route that utilises bridleways and paths through the dale between Grosmont and Pickering.

The light effects and use of colour show the influence of Jacopo Bassano, which the painter had picked up in Italy. It shows a monkey and a rogue flanking a boy blowing on an ember or taper. The central figure was a frequent theme for the artist (he had painted it a few years earlier as El Sopl√≥n for example), drawn from a story in Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia. The painting is probably a moralising warning about the consequences of lust, the ember bursting into flame symbolising sexual arousal, and the monkey and the buffoon the ever-present twin dangers of vice and folly.

Background  In 2012, eight years after the launch of Jira, Atlassian made Atlassian Marketplace available to the public to let independent developers make up for deficiencies of Jira. One of those deficiencies is the fact that Jira centers on modern, agile project management methodologies and neglects traditional, waterfall tools, such as the Gantt chart. And according to Project Management Institute, in 2017 89% of organizations still used waterfall project management methodologies.  Product  BigGantt utilizes a user's web browser. The app displays Jira tasks on a timeline in the form of colored bars of various lengths. Compared to the original 1910s idea of a bar chart devised by Henry Gantt, BigGantt adds contemporary functionalities, i.e. dependencies between tasks on the chart (arrows that link two tasks and change color from green to red when a dependency becomes \\"impossible\\"), baselines (shady bars marking the original location of a moved task), critical path, markers (vertical red lines on the timeline indicating crucial dates in the project), milestones. Users can drag and drop tasks on a chart. BigGantt is compatible with both Jira Core (essential functionalities) and Jira Software (essential functionalities + visual agile boards). The app is written in Java and Angular.  Reception  As of April 2019 BigGantt was used by at least 6100 enterprises.

It was designed and built in 1860 by David Wilson and William Ritchie. It is also known as Adelong Falls Gold Workings/Reserve. The property is owned by the Snowy Valleys Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Adelong Falls Reserve is within the Adelong Creek goldfield, which was proclaimed on 15 February 1855. The existing reservation for Public Recreation was notified on 26 November 1971. Most of the reserve south of Adelong Creek has always been Crown land, with the remainder in private ownership until 1980, when it became part of the reserve. The portion of the current reserve that lies north of the Creek was originally granted to or squired by David Wilson and William Ritchie between 1860 and 1885. Here they set up the Wilson and Ritchie Battery, one of the two principal ore processing plants on the Adelong field. The ruins and curtilage of the Battery were added to the reserve in 1980. Reef mining was well underway on the Adelong goldfields by 1859. It was at this time that William Ritchie and Scottish born David Wilson established a \\"Reefer Battery\\" at Adelong. In the late 1860s they moved the battery to its present location at Adelong Falls. The Battery and associated processing works were designed to extract gold from its bearing ore by hydraulic separation and mercury attraction. The ore was crushed in a stamper battery until it was fine enough to be washed over mercury treated plates which attracted the gold particles. Tailings from this process were then treated in a Chilean Mill and sluiced. These tailings were then ground and passed into a buddle, designed to further separate the heavy metal by agitation. A furnace was also present on the site to allow gold and mercury from the first sluicing to be separated. This multi- tiered extraction process was designed to ensure maximum return. The location of the battery made clever use of the topography. Its position within the cascade zone of Adelong Creek provided an immediate head of water. The slope of the bank where the works stood enabled ore to pass through by gravity feed, reducing the need for mechanical feeders. It also allowed a strong furnace draft via a smoke flue laid up the hillside like a covered drain. The major road linking Adelong to the reefs, crossed Adelong Creek at the head of the cascades, ensuring a constant stream of traffic past the battery. The battery opened on 17 July 1870. The thorough processing techniques and fortuitous position ensured it was an immediate success. In 1881, operations were expanded when the partners bought an existing battery at the head of Sawyer's Creek. They built a dam at the original 1858 battery site and dug a race to a water wheel at the newly acquired battery. This was a substantial undertaking involving an aqueduct over Sawyer's Creek and a long flume across the hill. At various times there were experiments with silver traps and cyanide processing but the basic design was so good that it always prevailed. The works ran from 1870 to 1910 and remain as one of the most successful operations on the Australian goldfields during the last part of the nineteenth century. Since 1980 the works have been accessible to the public as part of the Adelong Falls Reserve. In the early 1990s significant conservation works were undertaken on the extant remains, including the stabilisation of standing walls and the clearing of vegetation to attempt to regain the integrity of the original relationship of the site with the surrounding landscape. A number of mining companies have commenced operations in the area since 1986. Since May 1991 the Republic Mineral Corporation has continued to explore the gold lode in the Adelong Falls area immediately surrounding the Adelong Falls Reserve.  Description  The Adelong Falls Reserve comprises steep rocky slopes, openly timbered and falling sharply to Adelong Creek and Sawyer's Creek. A distinctive feature is the presence of a large number of Xanthorrhoea, especially in the southern corner. The Falls themselves are situated on Adelong Creek, north of . At this point, the creek passes through a narrow gorge about long and drops about in height over that distance. It is here that the remains of the Wilson and Ritchie Battery are located, about along the cascades. Archaeological investigations in 1985, showed that the Battery ruins are part of a larger, dynamically accrued complex of remains that extend past the boundary of the Adelong Falls Reserve. The battery site comprises: two water wheels with associated weirs, races and aqueducts; a 24-foot buddle; a series of holding tanks; a small quarry; a reverbatory furnace with separate brick stack; a weighbridge; a works office; a cottage with a terraced garden; a metalled entry road with stone revetments; three paths and an unidentified terrace. Immediately downstream of the curtilage are the weir, sluice and race that powered Gibraltar's works. An unknown battery stood on the upstream margin of the curtilage at the mouth of Sawyer's Creek. Both banks of that creek have been mined for its entire length. Approximately upstream of the curtilage are the stone abutments and iron pegs of a large dam. The spillway and sluice stand on the right bank, connected by a race to the water wheels of the Battery. The owner's house stood atop the ridge on the left bank opposite Sawyer's Creek, overlooking the site. The materials and techniques used in constructing the site (including the dam and owner's house outside the curtilage) are essentially uniform. Rough hewn granite, quarried on site, was used for all walls with the exception of the brick stack that terminates the furnace flue. Both concrete and lime mortar have been used. Timber was used sparingly, mainly for races, flooring and mountings. Roof cladding was corrugated iron.  Condition  The site is in ruins, but these are stable and well maintained. The archaeological potential is high. The quantity, quality and extent of the ruins and landscape features within the Reserve are remarkable.  Modifications and dates  1881: purchase of existing battery at Sawyer's Creek and construction of a dam, race, aqueduct and flume.  Heritage listing  The site displays considerable uniformity in materials, form and scale. It is enhanced by its setting and contributes to its setting which has remained largely undisturbed since the site was in operation. It is an integral part of the Adelong goldfields landscape. The ingenious application of raw materials and the use of topography to enhance the gold extraction process, stand out for their creative and technological excellence when compared with similar sites in New South Wales. The quantity, quality and extent of the ruins and landscape features within the Reserve are remarkable. The processes of gold exploration and extraction are some of the most romanticised in Australian history. The Battery complex provides an opportunity to demonstrate how reef gold was extracted as the site is both innovative and relatively intact.

Life  Mercie Lack is widely reported as a teacher in press coverage of her photography at Sutton Hoo. Miss Mercie Lack and a Miss Barbara Wagstaff joined the Royal Photographic Society in 1944 and gained their Associate the same year. They are reported as amongst the teaching staff of Putney High School 1935-6, which would fit with Lack's London photography series of the 1930s. She became a life member in 1949.Information supplied by the Royal Photographic Society. Accessed 9 June 2019.  London photography  Lack captured life on the night-time streets of 1930s London on glass lantern slides, which are now held by the Museum of London. Several of these slides featured in the Museum's temporary exhibition 'London Nights', May - November 2018.  Sutton Hoo  Excavation of the ship at Sutton Hoo in 1939. Still from film made by Charles Phillips' brother H. J. Phillips. Lack and Wagstaff were on holiday in Suffolk in 1939 when the Sutton Hoo ship burial was discovered. They arrived after the treasures had been removed and photographed the excavation of the ship itself. There are speculations that they had contacts at the British Museum who informed them of the discovery. There had been a call in 1936 for amateur photographers to help in documenting archaeological sites, and appeals were carried in the journal Antiquity in March 1936 as well as in photographers' magazines. Lack and Wagstaff appear to have been part of the response of the time but their photographs were of better quality than many of the other amateurs. They used Leica cameras and German 35mm Agfa colour slide film and so the photographs of Sutton Hoo represent one of the first excavations in Britain captured in colour. Lack also had a cine-camera and took a short 16mm film of the archaeologist Basil Brown excavating the midships section. In 2010, a collection of around 400 of Lack's photographs of Sutton Hoo were found to have been donated to the National Trust a few years before by a great-nephew. Until then there had been only the 29 official British Museum photographs of the excavations, and as records of measurements taken by staff from the Science Museum had been lost during World War II, Lack's photographs allowed for a more detailed re-construction of the dig than had been previously possible, particularly because many were annotated. A large number of Lack's photographs and slides are also in the British Museum collection. Lack was given a collection of ship rivets on the last day of the 1939 excavation by Charles Phillips. She bequeathed her collection of Sutton Hoo ship rivets to the British Museum.

It also involved the deployment of military tanks on the streets for the first time since World War II, and was one of the most serious disturbances involving squatters in the country. Background During the 1970s, squatting became increasingly prevalent in Amsterdam due to the lack of housing and the high number of decayed buildings in the city centre. Many of the squatters occupying land were youngsters from the baby boom generation, having trouble finding homes to live in. A previous riot in Amsterdam happened in 1966. Authorities did little to stop them before the events of 1980. Many riots occurred between the squatters and the authorities (overall referred to as Krakersrellen), the biggest being the Nieuwmarkt Riots in 1975. By the late 1970s the mood changed as politicians and real estate owners called for action against squatters. The mayor of Amsterdam at the time, Wim Polak, decided to start cracking down on squatters. Events Vondelstraat is a major street in the centre of Amsterdam and was the location of a large squatting squad that occupied property. On 29 February, the state evicted squatters from a building on the corner of Vondelstraat and Eerste Constantijn Huygensstraat. Amid violent protests from hundreds of squatters, who reoccupied the building and built huge barricades, over a thousand police officers and soldiers were deployed to stop their actions. The rioters threw objects and petrol bombs, and police responded with tear gas. Street fights continued until 3 March. A tank that was deployed, driven by Major Tom van Erk, managed to demolish the barricades. Calm returned that day. Fifty police officers were hurt during the events. Aftermath Another huge squatting protest happened on 30 April 1980 during the coronation of Queen Beatrix. Other riots, albeit smaller, also happened in August, September and December, as well as in 1981 and 1982. In the late 1980s the squatting movement became less prevalent, particularly after the increase of house building in the city. In 2010, the Dutch parliament voted to ban squatting entirely.

It is also called K2-236b. Its mass is 27 Earths, it takes 19.5 days to complete one orbit of its star, and is 0.148 AU from its star. Its discovery was reannounced in 2018. This was the first exoplanet discovered by scientists based in Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, India. The discoverers were Abhijit Chakraborty (PRL), Arpita Roy (Caltech), Rishikesh Sharma (PRL), Suvrath Mahadevan (Penn State), Priyanka Chaturvedi (Th√ºringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg), Neelam J.S.S.V Prasad (PRL), and B. G. Anandarao (PRL).  Overview  The exoplanet EPIC 211945201 b was discovered in 2018 using the transit method. Using this method, astronomers can see everything from methane to water vapor on other planets by photometry. It is the only planet orbiting around EPIC 211945201, a G0 class star, situated in the constellation of Cancer in 596 light-years from the Sun. Its host star is aged 4 billion years. EPIC 211945201 b orbits its star in about 19 terrestrial days. It orbits closer to the star than the internal limit of the habitable zone. It has a low density and may be composed of gas. It has a low Earth similarity index (0.14) and should be very different from our planet.  Discovery  EPIC 211945201 b was found to be a planetary candidate from K2 photometry in Campaigns 5 & 16\\\\. The exoplanet transits the bright star (Vmag = 10.15, G0 spectral type) in a 19.492 day orbit. The photometric data combined with false positive probability calculations using VESPA may not be sufficient to confirm the planetary scenario but high-resolution spectroscopic are taken using the PARAS spectrograph (19 radial velocity observations) over a time-baseline of 420 days. The data shows that the planet has a radius of 6.12 ¬± 0.1 R‚äï, and a mass of M‚äï. It consists of a density of g/cm3. Based on the mass and radius, it estimates that the heavy element content is 60-70 % of the total mass. The surface temperature of the planet was found to be around 776.35 K, as it is very close to the host star. It is seven times nearer to its star, in comparison with Earth-Sun distance. This shows that the extra- solar planet is in the uninhabitable zone. The discovery is of importance for understanding the formation mechanism of such super-Neptune or sub-Saturn kind of planets, that are too close to the host star, according to scientists.

A popular iconographic motif in the Middle Ages, it stems from the story of the woman who offered her veil to Jesus on his way to Calvary in order for Him to wipe His brow, after which His face was imprinted on the material.

It is one of 40 national scenic areas (NSA) in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure their protection from inappropriate development. The designated area covers 12,770 ha (49 square miles) of countryside surrounding the upper reaches of the River Tweed between Broughton and Peebles. National scenic areas are designated primarily to recognise the scenic qualities of an area, but sometimes also e.g. its culture, history, archaeology, geology or wildlife. Areas with such qualities may be protected via other national and international designations that overlap with the NSA designation. There are two Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) within the designated area of the Upper Tweeddale NSA. Although the national scenic area designation provides a degree of additional protection via the planning process, there are no bodies equivalent to a national park authority, and whilst local authorities (in this case Scottish Borders Council) can produce a management strategy for each one, only the three national scenic areas within Dumfries and Galloway currently have management strategies. Creation of the national scenic area Following the Second World War, a committee, chaired by Sir Douglas Ramsay, was established to consider preservation of the landscape in Scotland. The report, published in 1945, proposed that five areas (Loch Lomond and the Trossachs, the Cairngorms, Glen Coe-Ben Nevis-Black Mount, Wester Ross and Glen Strathfarrar- Glen Affric-Glen Cannich) should receive a level of protection. Accordingly, the government designated these areas as \\"national park direction areas\\", giving powers for planning decisions taken by local authorities to be reviewed by central government. Following a further review of landscape protection in 1978, additional areas, including the area of the current Upper Tweeddale NSA, were identified as worthy of protection due to their landscape qualities. Accordingly, in 1981 the direction areas were replaced by the national scenic area designation, which was based on the 1978 recommendations and thus included this area. The defined area remains as originally mapped in 1978, but was redesignated under new legislation in 2010. Description Neidpath Castle. The original 1978 report that led to the area being designated as a national scenic area noted: Historic features of the area include the hill fort at Dreva Craig, Barns Tower, and the castles at Stobo, Neidpath and Tinnis. The John Buchan Way, a 22 km walking route between Broughton and Peebles, passes through the area. Conservation designations The River Tweed (including tributaries such as the Manor Water and the Holm Water) is designated as a Special Area of Conservation, holding important populations of salmon, brook lamprey, river lamprey, sea lamprey and otter. The river has a very diverse ecology due to the mixed geology of its catchment area, and is also designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). There is a further SSSI within the boundaries of the NSA, the Tweedsmuir Hills, which form the largest area of mountain plateau in Scotland outwith (i.e. outside) the Highlands, and which hosts nationally important populations of breeding birds, mosses, liverworts and arctic‚Äìalpine plants. The grounds surrounding Barns Tower and Stobo Castle, and Dawyck Botanic Garden, are listed in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.

It is still popular in W√ºrttemberg, where it is usually played in groups of three or four as a family game rather than in the pubs. In three-hand games, each player competes for himself, while in four-hand games, known as Cross Binokel (Kreuzbinokel), two teams are formed with partners sitting opposite one another. The game was introduced to America by German immigrants in the first half of the 20th century, where it developed into the similar game of Pinochle. Binocle was still played in Switzerland in 1994. In south Germany, the game is sometimes called by its Swabian name, Benoggl.Benoggl - Turnier in Reez' at immerfeicht- reez.de. Retrieved 7 April 2020.Benoggl-Turnier at allevents.in. Retrieved 7 April 2020.Binokel und seine Regeln at www.binokelsportfreundeflacht.de Retrieved 7 April 2020.\\"Benoggl\\" klopfen! at www.hirsch-manolzweiler.de. Retrieved 7 April 2020. Binokel belongs to the family of melding and trick- taking games. Unlike others in the family, special card combinations (family, four of a kind, etc.) score additional points. After the deal in the three- or four-player game, there is an auction to bid for the dabb (stack of undealt cards c.f. Skat) or tapp. Players bid depending on the card points they expect to score from taking tricks and making melds. The team with the highest bid has to win the game, i.e. score more points in tricks and melds than they bid. Although some of the rules vary from place to place, the basics are standard.  Origin  The game originated from the French card games, B√©zique and Cinq Cents and is recorded as early as 1847 as a game being played in Berne, Switzerland, where it is described as a \\"combination of Whist and L'Hombre played between four players.\\" In 1856 it is recorded as being played, alongside the game of Brelan, in Vevey on the shores of Lake Geneva. In 1857, Pierer confirms that it is a Swiss card game. A derivative of it, known as Pinochle, is popular in the United States where it was imported by German immigrants in the second half of the 19th century. The name probably comes from the Italian, bin oculi (\\"two eyes\\"), because it is played with a double hand. It is still a popular family game in W√ºrttemberg and in Switzerland.  Aim  The aim of Binokel is to be first to reach a predetermined score, usually 1,500, by a combination of melding and trick-taking. The game ends when a player reaches or exceeds the target at the end of a completed deal i.e. it may not be achieved by 'going out'.  Cards  The Ober of Bells from a W√ºrttemberg-pattern pack  Packs and suits  The game traditionally uses two, shortened, German-suited packs of playing cards but two ordinary packs of cards may be used. In south Germany and online, special packs designed for Binokel are sold under the name \\"Gaigel/Binokel\\" and use German-suited, W√ºrttemberg pattern cards. There are four suits, commonly called Acorns (German: Eichel), Leaves (Schippen, Gr√ºn, Gras, Laub), Hearts (Herz) and Bells (Schellen, Bollen). These equate to Clubs, Spades, Hearts and Diamonds in a French suited pack. If a proper Binokel pack is not available, two Skat packs can be used with the 8s and 9s removed so that the 7s are the only low-ranking cards left. A Doppelkopf pack with French playing cards may also be used or, in extremis, two Anglo-American pattern packs with the Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives, Sixes, Eights and Nines removed. In addition to cards, a paper and pencil (or slate and chalk) will be needed for keeping score.  Card ranking  The card values in descending order are: AceStrictly a Deuce. (Daus, Sau, Alte or Ass), Ten (Zehner), King (K√∂nig), Ober (Ober), Unter (Unter or Bauer) and, usually, a Seven (Siebener, Leerer, Nixle, Dis, Di√ü or Diss). However, Binokel can be played without the Sevens, unlike Gaigel.Was isch'n eigendlich BENOGGEL? at benoggler.de.

Three-hand Binokel  The following rules for three-hand Binokel are based on Grupp (1994).  Dealing  A pack of 48 cards is used. The dealer shuffles and offers the cards to the player on his left for cutting, before dealing 15 cards to each player, anticlockwise, in packets of five. After the first or second round of the deal, the dealer places 3 cards face-down on the table to form the tapp or, in Swabian, dabb.  Bidding  In the first phase of the game, bidding (reizen) takes place for the dabb. Players review the strength of their hands and assess the minimum number of card points they will score by melding and taking tricks. The aim of bidding (also called the auction) is to secure the 'contract', i.e. the right to pick up the dabb, announce the trump suit and call for a card from an opponent (Rufen). In a three-hand game, forehand, the player to the right of the dealer, says \\"pass!\\" (weg) if he doesn't think he can make the minimum score, or starts the bidding (anschreien) with the player on his right, usually beginning with \\"150!\\". Rearhand (on the dealer's left) may reply with a bid (Reizen) 10 points higher or pass. Bidding continues in this way between the two players until one passes. Next the dealer gets the chance to bid. The player who bids the highest score wins the auction. The bid is recorded to prevent subsequent disputes. Finally the dabb is turned over for all to see and the auction winner picks it up and decides which cards to discard in exchange. = Going out = If the highest bidder does not see any chance of reaching his bid after picking up the dabb, he can 'go out' (abgehen). He chooses the trump suit to 'go out' in e.g. by saying \\"out in Leaves\\" (Ab in Schippen) and reveals his cards at the same time. A player who goes out may not meld and loses (geht/f√§hrt) the number of points bid; thus his bid is simply subtracted from his score. His opponents score for their melds plus 30 points. Example: A player announces \\"I'll go out in Bells\\" (Ab in Schellen, Swabian: I gang ab en Schell√¢). This means that Bells would have been the trump suit. The opponents may still meld \\"with 30\\" (30 mit) i.e. scoring for their melds plus a bonus of 30 points. Thus picking the suit to go out in is important to minimise the opponents' likely melds.  Discarding  The player who is \\"in the game\\" (im Spiel), the declarer, must, before he melds, discard (dr√ºcken) the same number of cards picked up from the dab in order to hold the same number of cards as the other players. If he forgets or discards the wrong number of cards, he loses the game. The declarer loses double in such as case (double the bid value is deducted from his score). This is also the case if a melded card is accidentally discarded (gedr√ºckt). Special rules about discarding: the Dissle (7 of Trumps) may be melded and discarded. The declarer must inform the other players, however. Sometimes, the declarer, if he discards trump cards, must also tell the others how many trump cards he has discarded.  Calling  A rule not normally used by serious players but common in family games is 'calling' (Rufen) for a card that the declarer does not hold in order e.g. to improve his melds. This must be done before melding begins. If calling is allowed, bidding often begins at 300.  Melding  The player who has the game (by winning the dabb) is the first to meld, having first announced trumps. = Melds = Now combinations of cards or melds are placed, which make up a part of the points needed to win. The following melds are possible: {   style=\\"background: #c0c8f8;\\" colspan = \\"4;\\" align=center  Melds in Binokel - style=\\"background: #C0C0C0;\\" colspan = \\"2;\\" align=center  Pairs, Diss and Last Trick  style=\\"background: #C0C0C0;\\" colspan = \\"2;\\" align=center  Four/Eight of a Kind -  Diss ( of trumps turned up, played or declared)  align=\\"right\\"  10  Four Unters (of different suits)  align=\\"right\\"  40 -  Last trick  align=\\"right\\"  10  Four Obers (of different suits)  align=\\"right\\"  60 -  Pair ( + or + of any plain suit)  align=\\"right\\"  20  Four Kings (of different suits)  align=\\"right\\"  80 -  Trump Pair (2 x + or 2 x + of the trump suit)  align=\\"right\\"  40  Four Aces (of different suits)  align=\\"right\\"  100 -  Procession or Grand Procession (4 pairs)  align=\\"right\\"  240  Eight of a Kind  align=\\"right\\"  1000 -  style=\\"background: #C0C0C0;\\" colspan = \\"2;\\" align=center  Binokels style=\\"background: #C0C0C0;\\" colspan = \\"2;\\" align=center  Families -  Binokel (O + U or Q + J)  align=\\"right\\"  40  Family ( or , same suit)  align=\\"right\\"  100 -  Double Binokel (both O + U or Q + J)  align=\\"right\\"  300  Trump Family  align=\\"right\\"  150 -  Grand Binokel (K + O + U or K + Q + J)  align=\\"right\\"  80  Double Family (10 cards of one suit, less 7s)  align=\\"right\\"  1,500 } Cards can also be used multiple times for melds: an Ober of Leaves, King of Leaves and an Unter of Bells, for example, can be melded as a binokel and a pair. In the same way, four of a kind, of which one card is part of a family, can also be melded. On the other hand, a single Ober or King cannot form a pair with the cards of a family, just as one cannot meld a King and two Obers of a suit as two pairs. The melded points only count if at least one trick has been taken; otherwise the melds are annulled. = Procession = If a player has four pairs, one in each suit, he can meld a so-called procession (Rundgang). It is not a real combination, so there are no special points for it, unlike other combinations such as the double binokel (two single binokels score 300). However, the experienced player automatically knows that 240 points are awarded for the procession: Four Kings score 80, four Obers score 60 and the trump pair and three normal pairs score 100. If a family is melded at the same time as the procession, the procession only scores 200 (trump) or 220 points (non-trump), since the points for the King and Ober in the family may not count twice.  Trick-taking  After the melds have been made, tricks are played for. As in the bidding phase, play is anticlockwise and begins with the player who started the bidding, except in the special contracts such as Durch (see below). The following apply in descending order: * Farbzwang: players must follow suit. * Stichzwang: players must win the trick if they can; i. e. play a higher card than the card(s) already played to the trick. * Trumpfzwang: if a player cannot follow suit, he must play a trump * Who played first, wins (Z'erschd g‚Äôschbielt, z'erschd g‚Äôschdoch√¢): if two cards of the same value are played, the first one wins. A trump card automatically beats all cards of another suit.  Scoring  In the fourth phase, the card points in the tricks are counted. Whoever takes the last trick gets an extra 10 points. When the card points have been totted up, they are rounded up or down to the nearest 10 points. Players should also check whether the declarer has reached the bid value with the sum of the melded points and the card points from the game. If the bid level is not reached, the declarer is \\"in the cellar\\" (in den Keller). His melds and tricks do not score and twice the bid value is deducted from his score. The game comprises a number of deals in which players vie to be first to reach the target score, usually 1,500 points. According to Grupp (1994), each loser pays the winner a sum based on the difference between his score and the winners; typically 10pf (now 5¬¢) per 100 points difference.  Special contracts  The following special contracts may be played.  Durch  If a player has a particularly good hand, they may announce a durch or Durchmarsch (Swabian: d'r Ob√¢rom) which is the equivalent of a slam or march. The aim of durch is to take all 15 tricks. No trump suit is chosen and there are no melds. The player who declares a durch 'comes out' (kommt raus) i.e. leads to the first trick. A durch scores 1,000 points if played from the hand and 1,500 if played 'open' or 'ouvert' (hingelegten) i.e. if the player puts his cards face up on the table before the first trick, because it is clear that no trick will be lost. The rarest form is Open Hand Durch (aufgelegte Durch von der Hand). This is where the declarer puts his cards on the table and without taking the dabb. If an opponent wins a trick, the game is lost and the declarer has twice the points for a win deducted from his score.  Bettel  In bettel or untendurch (Swabian: d'r Onn√¢rom) the aim is not to take any tricks as in a mis√®re in other games. It is not commonly played in Binokel. No trump suit is chosen, there are no melds and, depending on the area, either the declarer or the on 'in front' (vorne) begins. Untendurch scores 1,000, 1,500 or 500 points depending on the region. However, an untendurch contract is not very common, since the probability of winning it is much less than for durch. In untendurch, Stichzwang applies, i.e. if you can win the trick, you must!  Four-hand Binokel and Cross Binokel  There are two variants for four players: Four-hand Binokel (Viererspiel) and Cross Binokel (Kreuzbinokel). The following brief description is based on Grupp (1994).  Four-hand Binokel  This follows the rules of Three-hand Binokel except that the dealer sits out and just receives 200 points for dealing.  Cross Binokel  This is the most common form, the four players forming two permanent teams of two players for the session, partners sitting opposite one another. Each is dealt eleven cards and four are dealt to the dabb. The game is played as for Three-hand Binokel, except that the two players in a team combine their points.  Two-hand Binokel  The following is based on the rules for two-handed Binokel in the Spielregelnb√ºchlein aus Altenburg.  Dealing  Players are dealt 12 cards, the next is turned as trumps‚Äîif it is a Seven the dealer receives 10 points‚Äîand the remainder placed face down as a talon, half-covering the trump turnup. There is no dabb. Forehand plays to the first trick. There is no compulsion to follow suit or trump as long as the talon is not exhausted. If two cards of the same rank and suit are played to a trick, the first wins. The winner of a trick draws another card from the talon and lets his opponent do likewise, before leading to the next trick.  Melds  Melds are made during the first part of the game, by a player who has won a trick and is on lead. Only one meld may be declared at a time. Melds may be added to and cards may be used for more than one meld, except that the King and Ober within a family do not count as a pair, nor may a King be paired with two Obers or an Ober with two Kings. Players may play from their hand or from their melds. Possible melds are: {   style=\\"background: #c0c8f8;\\" colspan = \\"4;\\" align=center  Melds in Two-hand Binokel - style=\\"background: #C0C0C0;\\" colspan = \\"2;\\" align=center  Pairs, Diss and Last Trick  style=\\"background: #C0C0C0;\\" colspan = \\"2;\\" align=center  Quartets (of different suits) -  Diss ( of trumps turned up, played or declared)  align=\\"right\\"  10  Four Unters/Jacks  align=\\"right\\"  40 -  Last trick  align=\\"right\\"  10  Four Obers/Queens  align=\\"right\\"  60 -  Pair ( + ) or ( + ) of any plain suit  align=\\"right\\"  20  Four Kings  align=\\"right\\"  80 -  Trump pair (2 x + ) or 2 x ( + of the trump suit)  align=\\"right\\"  40  Four Aces  align=\\"right\\"  100 -  style=\\"background: #C0C0C0;\\" colspan = \\"2;\\" align=center  Binokels and Quintmajor style=\\"background: #C0C0C0;\\" colspan = \\"2;\\" align=center  Octets -  Binokel (O + U) or (Q + J)  align=\\"right\\"  40  Eight Unters/Jacks  align=\\"right\\"  400 -  Grand Binokel (K + O + U) or (K + Q + J)  align=\\"right\\"  80   Eight Obers/Queens  align=\\"right\\"  600 -  Quintmajor () or () of trumps  align=\\"right\\"  250  Eight Kings  align=\\"right\\"  800 -  Double Binokel (2 x O + U) or (2 x Q + J)  align=\\"right\\"  300 Eight Aces  align=\\"right\\"  1000 }  Talon exhausted  Once the talon is exhausted, players collect their remaining meld cards and add them to their hand. From now on they must follow suit or, if unable to do so, play a trump. The winner of the last trick gets 10 points.  Scoring  The game is normally played for 1000 points. Scoring of melds is usually done at the time of the meld; card points are totted up after the last trick. However, if one player is approaching 1,000 points, card points should also be mentally added up as they are won, so that a player can announce reaching 1,000 before game end.

The BKR was formed by the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) in its session on 22 August 1945 and announced by President Sukarno on the next day. The establishment of the BKR was a change from the results of the PPKI session on 19 August 1945 that had previously planned the formation of the national army. The amendment was finally decided on 22 August 1945 not to form a national army. This decision is based on various political considerations. The leaders of the time chose to take more diplomacy to gain recognition of the newly proclaimed independence. The armed Japanese occupation troops, complete with falling mental defeat, became a consideration as well, to avoid clashes when a national army was immediately formed. Members of the BKR at that time were young Indonesians who had previously received military education as Heiho soldiers, Pembela Tanah Air (PETA), the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) and others. The central BKR headquarters was located in Jakarta, led by Moefreni Moekmin. Through official decree in 5 October 1945, the BKR was changed to the People's Security Army (TKR) and, after several name changes, eventually became the Indonesian Armed Forces. Background On 19 August 1945 in the PPKI session, two PPKI members Abikoesno Tjokrosoejoso and Oto Iskandar di Nata proposed to form a state defense body. However, the proposal was rejected on the grounds that it could provoke clashes with the occupying Imperial Japanese Army who were still armed and invited the intervention of Allied troops who would disarm the Japanese army after the Surrender of Japan. The 344,000 Japanese troops throughout Indonesia were mentally devastated by losing the war. With an unstable mental state they were given the task by the allied forces to maintain security in Indonesia, until allies came. On August 20, 1945, the Family Assistance Service for Victims of War (BPKKP; ), was established and on August 22, 1945 the People's Security Council (BKR; ), was formed, which was part of BPKKP, which was originally called the Assistant Maid Agency () and later became the Assisting Defense Agency (), or BPP. BPP already existed during the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies and was responsible for maintaining the welfare of PETA and Heiho. But on August 18, 1945, four days before the formation of BKR, Japan disbanded PETA and Heiho. The responsibility to accommodate former PETA and Heiho members was handed to BPKKP. Formation President Sukarno on 23 August 1945 announced the establishment of BKR. The President made a speech by inviting youth volunteers, former members of PETA, Heiho, and the Imperial Japanese Navy to gather on August 24, 1945 in their respective regions. In Jakarta, youth and former PETA successfully formulated the BKR structure in accordance with the territorial structure of the Japanese occupation. These youths call themselves BKR administrators at the central level consisting of Kaprawi, Sutaklasana, Latief Hendraningrat, Arifin Abdurrachman, Machmud and Zulkifli Lubis. Meanwhile, the formation of BKR outside Jakarta was spearheaded by Arudji Kartawinata (West Java), Drg Mustopo (East Java), and Sudirman (Central Java). In addition to BKR Land, BKR Sea was also formed which was spearheaded by former students and teachers from the High School of Sailing () and the sailors from the Shipping Service () consisting of Mas Pardi, Adam, Eddy Martadinata and R Suryadi. Especially in West Java, Hidayat and Kartakusumah as former KNIL officers joined and led the BKR of the Central Bandung Railway Station () and other railway stations. Due to limited communication facilities at that time, not all regions in Indonesia know the formation of BKR. In eastern Sumatra and Aceh, BKR never formed. But generally the youths in the area formed an organization that would form the core of the army. In Aceh, youth established the Indonesian Youth Force (API; ), and youths in Palembang formed the People's Security Guard (PKR; ) or the People's Security Guard Agency (BPKR; ). The youth who disagreed with the establishment of the BKR formed separate resistance organizations which generally supported the independence cause. In Bandung there was the Indonesian Youth Student Association (P3I; ), in Surabaya there was the Indonesian Young Generation (AMI; ), in Padang there is the Indonesian Youth Information Center (BPPI; ), and in South Kalimantan there is the Youth League of the Republic of Indonesia (BPRI; ). Formation of BKR Land On 29 August 1945 the Central Indonesian National Committee (KNIP) was established and authorized by the government. Then KNIP endorsed the establishment of the BKR Center in Jakarta. BKR Jakarta led by Moefreni Moekmin assisted by Priyatna, Soeroto Koento, Daan Yahya, Daan Mogot, Sujono and Latief Hendraningrat. In Bogor BKR was formed in October 1945 which was pioneered by former PETA members Husein Sastranegara and Ibrahim Adjie. In Parahyangan, a BKR group was formed on August 28, 1945 and led by Arudji Kartawinata (former Daidan PETA in Cimahi) and Pardjaman (former Daidan PETA in Bandung). The establishment of BKR Parahyangan was followed by the formation of BKR groups in Garut, Tasikmalaya,Ciamis, Majalengka, and Purwakarta. BKR Lembang is led by Amir Machmud while BKR Sumedang is led by Umar Wirahadikusumah. BKR groups were also established in other regions in Indonesia. In Central Java, BKR Purwokerto was led by Soedirman, while BKR Surakarta was led by GPH Djatikusumo. In Surabaya on August 24, 1945, a meeting was held to form BKR which was attended by Moestopo, Jonosewojo, Soengkono, and Sukarno. The result of the meeting decided to call the former members of PETA, Heiho and other youths to join BKR members on September 10, 1945. Establishment of BKR Sea The announcement of the establishment of BKR was also greeted enthusiastically by the youths who served in the marine sector, former Kaigun Heiho, the employees of Jawa Unko Kaisha and the students and teachers of the High School of Sailing. They took the initiative to maintain order and security at each port. Pioneered by Mas Pardi, the youths held meetings. The result of these meetings on September 10, 1945 was formed BKR Sea Center led by Mas Pardi and then endorsed by the Central Indonesian National Committee. After getting the approval and then formed troops BKR Sea who started the actions take over the Jawa Unko Kaisha building and buildings in Port of Tanjung Priok. The BKR Sea Center also issued instructions to youth sailors in the area to immediately establish a BKR Sea group in their respective areas. Formation of BKR Air The formation of BKR Air was spearheaded by former Dutch and Japanese aviators in the air base areas and assisted by youth who had never served in the field of aviation. The former Dutch aviators were former members of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force, the Netherlands Naval Aviation Service and the Volunteer Fir Corps (). In addition there were former Japanese aviators who served in the Rikugun Koku Butai, Kaigun Koku Butai, and Nanpo Koku Kabusyiki.

It was the biggest episode of such disturbances in the country since the end of World War II and the most significant event of the Dutch squatters' movement (Krakersrellen). Background Since the 1960s and the 1970s, squatting had become a common to protest the shortage of housing in Amsterdam. Many of the protesters were youngsters of the baby boomer generation. Some of the biggest riots were the Nieuwmarkt Riots in 1975 and the Vondelstraat Riots in March 1980, when authorities heavily responded to evict squatters from properties in the city. On 31 January, Queen Juliana announced that she would abdicate in favour of her eldest daughter, Princess Beatrix, on 30 April. Riots The main slogan of the protests, written on a wall on 26 March 1980, a month before the riots Beatrix ascended the throne on 30 April 1980, and squatters started to riot. The protesters were rallying under the slogan Geen woning, geen kroning (No house, no coronation). Despite the presence of 10,000 police officers, gendarmes and some military officers, the event turned into a major clash. The riots were centred around the Dam Square, where the new Queen's inauguration took place. Clashes also happened in and around Blauwbrug, Rokin and Vondelstraat. One of the protesters, Karel Fassotte, claimed in an interview that apart from squatters, people taking part included ordinary students and football hooligans. It marked a milestone in the postwar mostly-peaceful history of the Netherlands in which 600 people were wounded. Aftermath The squatters' movement had much support for their cause beforehand, but that was depreciated following the riots, partly because the Dutch royal family was highly popular, but the squatters had turned the day of accession into one of violence. A new police leadership in Amsterdam started to force the evacuaation of squatted buildings, including through special means. In 2010, the Dutch parliament voted to ban squatting entirely.

The property is owned by Roads and Maritime Services, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The bridge was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000.  History  Annual Public Works reports suggest that work on the bridge commenced in 1893, and was completed by June 1895. According to the plans for the bridge, this structure replaced an older bridge which had been located immediately south (upstream) of the new bridge. The bridge was named the Shelley Bridge after the wife of Mr. George Shelley, one of the first settlers of Tumut, arriving in 1832. the name Shelley Bridge appears to have dropped out of use until the late 1950s when E. H. Shelley, a grandson of Mrs. Shelley, requested that: 'The name of our late grandmother should be honoured by having the bridge officially recorded as the Shelley Bridge, in accordance with the wishes of the relatives as indicated at the opening. At the time of this request there appears to have been no record of the bridge being named Shelley, but it was listed by the Public Works Department as the Junction Bridge over the Tumut River at Shelley's. However, Mr Shelley's request was complied with and action was taken to have signs erected at the bridge, naming it as Shelley's Bridge.RTA file 439.61 Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) maintenance records for the Junction Bridge commenced in 1932, although notes from that year mention previous maintenance works carried out by the NSW Department of Public Works.  Description  The Bridge consists of four timber girder approach spans and three McDonald truss spans. The bridge has a road width of between kerbs, accommodating a single lane of traffic. The original bridge plans show four timber girder spans on the Tumut side and no approach span on the other. However, it is nowhere stated in the records whether the Tumut end was built with three spans or whether one span was later removed. The approach span on the Punt Bridge (or eastern) side was added around 1975 due to scour of the river bank which is on the outside of a bend in the river.  Heritage listing  As at 13 September 2005, Junction Bridge is one of five McDonald trusses remaining in NSW to date (one of which is no longer used by road traffic), and of these, it is ranked second in terms of its heritage significance.MBK 1999: 90 The bridge is readily accessible from Sydney and the nearby alpine areas and is situated in an idyllic rural setting over the Tumut River. The bridge is the only existing triple span arrangement of the McDonals truss, a seminal bridge type designed by a prominent local engineer who was part of an important influential group of NSW Public Works Department Engineers, including Percy Allan, Harvey Dare, Ernest de Burgh and John Bradfield. Junction Bridge was designed to make full use of Australian native hardwoods as structural members and forms part of a group of bridge types that combine to illustrate the evolution of timber truss bridge design in Australia. Collectively, these revolutionized the ability of the government to provide trafficable roads around NSW in the late nineteenth century. While the Bridge as a whole has been assessed as fulfilling the criteria for listing on the SHR, the various elements that comprise the bridge are of varying levels of significance: abutments, approach spans and barrier railing are of moderate significance, the deck is of high significance, and the truss spans and cross girders are of exceptional significance. The Junction Bridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000.

PWI was established on 9 February 1946 in Surakarta to coincide with National Press Day. PWI consists of journalists spread all over Indonesia. Currently PWI is led by Margiono as chairman who has served from 2013 to 2018.  History  The establishment of the PWI organization became the beginning of Indonesia's struggle against colonialism in Indonesia through media and writing. After the establishment of PWI, similar organizations were also established. The organization was the Newspaper Publishers Union (SPS; ) on 8 June 1946. The SPS changed its name to the Press Company Union (SPP; ) in 2011, coinciding with the 65th SPS anniversary. The interest in establishing SPS at that time departed from the idea that the ranks of national press publishers needed to be immediately organized and managed, in its idiomatic and commercial terms, considering that the colonial press and foreign press were still alive and still trying to maintain its influence. Because the distance of time of establishment is close and has a similar historical background, PWI and SPS are likened to \\"conjoined twins\\" in the world of journalism.  Business committee  Before its establishment, PWI formed a preparatory committee in the beginning of the beginning of 1946. The preparatory committee was formed on 9-10 February 1946 at the Sono Suko meeting hall, Surakarta, when a meeting was held between Indonesian journalists. The meeting was attended by various journalists, including press figures who were leading newspapers, magazines, journalists and fighters. The meeting resulted in two decisions, including: * Approved to form an Indonesian journalists organization, chaired by Sumanang Surjowinoto with the secretary Sudarjo Tjokrosisworo. * Approved to form a committee consisting of: *# Sjamsuddin Sutan Makmur (Harian Rakyat Jakarta) *# Burhanuddin Mohammad Diah (Harian Merdeka) *# Abdul Rachmat Nasution (Antara) *# Ronggodanukusumo (Suara Rakyat, Mojokerto) *# Mohammad Kurdie (Suara Merdeka, Tasikmalaya) *# Bambang Suprapto (Pembela Rakyat, Magelang) *# Sudjono (Koran Berjuang, Malang) *# Suprijo Djojosupadmo (Kedaulatan Rakyat, Yogyakarta). The eight commissions that have been formed are then assisted by Sumanang and Sudarjo Tjokrosisworo formulated the matters of the national press at that time and the effort to coordinate it into a national press line. The 10-member commission was also called the \\"Business Committee\\". Three weeks later, the Business Committee held a meeting again in Surakarta to coincide with the session of the Central Indonesian National Committee which took place from 28 February to March 1946. The Business Committee held a meeting and discussed the issues faced by the press. From the meeting it was then agreed to establish a Newspaper Company Union in order to coordinate newspaper business associations whose founders were the founders of PWI.

His continued advocacy for biodiesel spans three decades, and he is credited with being the driving force behind the growth of soybean oil within the biodiesel industry, granting him the nickname ‚Äúthe ‚Äògodfather‚Äô of biodiesel.‚Äù Johannes has also served as the executive director for multiple soybean organizations.  College and early career  Born in Leigh, Nebraska, Johannes earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Concordia University Nebraska in education and performed graduate studies at the University of Nebraska. Johannes then taught grade-school during a span of 4.5 years before returning to home in Nebraska to grow soybeans and corn and raise livestock on his family farm. As a farmer, Johannes became involved in soybean advocacy, joining the Nebraska Soybean Association, followed by the Nebraska Soybean Checkoff Board in 1980. He was later appointed as the Nebraska representative to the American Soybean Development Foundation in 1982, where he was later elected assistant treasurer. In 1986, he became the executive director of both the Wisconsin Soybean Association and the Wisconsin Corn Growers Association, as well as their checkoff boards. In 1988, he was hired as the executive director for the Missouri Soybean Association and the Missouri Soybean Merchandising Council (MSMC).  Biodiesel and soybean advocacy  Johannes first became interested in the concept of soy-diesel, after reading a report by the American Soybean Association that involved using soybean oil in a diesel engine. In his position with the Missouri Soybean Association in 1991, he expanded efforts to use soybean oil in industrial application such as a biodiesel as an alternative to petrodiesel. Later that year, Johannes arranged the first commercial sale of soy diesel to exclusively fuel a 1991 Dodge truck, purchased by the Missouri Soybean Association. At the 1992 Corn Soybean Expo in Fargo, North Dakota, Johannes explained the process of transesterification and its resulting byproducts such as biodiesel, and told the group that the market for soy-diesel could top 150 million gallons in the next three years. Johannes served as staff for the National Soy Fuels Advisory Committee (NSFAC), which was created in 1992 by state Qualified State Soybean Boards for the purpose of establishing the groundwork and strategy to create a national demand for soy diesel. Later that year, under Johannes' guidance, and after commissioning a study to help chart the course for its members, NSFAC formed the National SoyDiesel Development Board (NSDB) to supervise and implement soy diesel research and market development projects. Johannes was hired as the first executive director of the National SoyDiesel Development Board (NSDB) in 1993, later renamed the National Biodiesel Board, where he played a critical role in creating a foundation for policy, research, and development of biodiesel using soybean oil and other feedstocks. In June 1993, Johannes presented a paper on U.S. farmers' efforts to commercialize biodiesel at the International Energy Agency on \\"Vegetable Oils as Transportation Fuels in the United States,\\" at the University of Pisa in Pisa, Italy. That same year, the NSDB under Johannes' leadership, began funding pilot programs to facilitate using 20 percent biodiesel blends in ten transit agencies across the nation, including Los Angeles, California. The use of biodiesel was estimated to cut 5,400 pounds of pollution in a six-month period. In 1995, Johannes and colleagues submitted a three-step marketing plan to the National Biodiesel Board, which helped to expand the industry and to establish the framework for creating quality standards for biodiesel production. Since the creation of the NSDB (and subsequent organizations), soybean producers have seen a 15 percent growth of price support through biodiesel alone, and Johannes' has continued to advocate for the environmental benefits of soy diesel's use to the nation's largest fleets. In 2017, the National Biodiesel Board featured Johannes in their opening video advertisement where he reflects on the progression of biodiesel throughout the years. In 2001, Johannes became CEO of the Kansas Soybean Association and Administrator of the Kansas Soybean Commission where he works on behalf of soybean farmers to advance markets. In this role, he has been involved in international marketing on behalf of soybean farmers, working with the biodiesel, animal agriculture, and aquaculture industries. Johannes advocated for the growth of the biodiesel industry in a 2016 EPA hearing where he urged the EPA to recognize the significant reduction of carbon that results from biodiesel use. He also emphasized the positive effects on the economy that have come as a byproduct from the creation of the industry.https://www.kansasagnetwork.com/2016/kan-bonus-podcast-kansas- soybean-association-ceo-kenlon-johannes-comments-at-epa-hearing/ In written 2016 testimony to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Johannes requested that the EPA continue to raise volume number requirements of biodiesel. In September 2017, Johannes traveled to Japan as a member of the \\"Heartland Team\\" with the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) to meet with buyers of U.S. pork and beef.  Awards and honors  *2008: Johannes was inducted into the Nebraska Softball Hall of Fame from his twenty-four years playing with fast-pitch teams across Nebraska.

The Jupiter-like planet is discovered by 39 astronomers, mainly Max G√ºnther, Didier Queloz, Edward Gillen, Laetitia Delrez, and Francois Bouchy.  Overview  NGTS-3Ab was discovered in 2018 by the use of transit method. It is the only planet orbiting around NGTS-3 A, a G6 V class star, situated in the constellation of Columba in 3294 light years from the Sun. The exoplanet orbits its star in about 2 terrestrial days. The orbit is closer to the star than the internal limit of the habitable zone. It has a low density and can be composed of gas. It has a low Earth similarity index (0.06) and should be very different from our planet.  Discovery  The discovery of NGTS-3Ab, a hot Jupiter found orbiting a star in a still visually unresolved binary system, was announced in June 2018. The data regarding the exoplanet is based on the data gathered with the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS), SPECULOOS, and HARPS, and enhanced by recent advances with the centroiding technique for NGTS. The planetary system NGTS-3A was detected by a conjointly model multi-colour photometry, centroids and radial velocity (RV) extraction process. RV cross-correlation functions (CCFs) and study correlations of the bisector inverse span (BIS) are simulated in order to define the characteristics of the exoplanet NGTS-3Ab.

Suppression of Mokot√≥w - a wave of mass murders, looting, arson and rapes that swept through the Warsaw district of Mokot√≥w during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. Crimes against prisoners of war and civilians of the district were committed by the Germans until the capitulation of Mokot√≥w on September 27, 1944, although they intensified in the first days of the uprising.  German crimes on the first day of the uprising  On August 1, 1944, at 5 p.m., Home Army soldiers hit German facilities in all districts of occupied Warsaw. On that day the units of the 5th Home Army District \\"Mokot√≥w\\" suffered heavy losses during unsuccessful attacks on the heavily strengthened German resistance points on Rakowiecka and Pu≈Çawska Streets. The insurgents also failed to gain many other targets - such as barracks in schools on Kazimierzowska and Woronicza Streets, Fort Mokot√≥w, or horse racing track in S≈Çu≈ºewiecAdam Borkiewicz: Powstanie warszawskie.

However, in the following days the insurgents managed to expand their possessions and organize a strong resistance centre in Upper Mokot√≥w. On the night of August 1-2, 1944, SS, police and Wehrmacht units committed a number of war crimes in Mokot√≥w. Insurgents taken captive were shot, wounded were killed. The Germans disregarded the fact that the Home Army soldiers conducted the fight openly and had the legal markings of a soldier, i.e. they fought in accordance with the Hague ConventionAntoni Przygo≈Ñski: Powstanie warszawskie w sierpniu 1944 r.

The murders of prisoners and civilians were ordered by the commander of the Okƒôcie garrison, General Doerfler.  Hitler's Order on the Destruction of Warsaw and its execution in Mokot√≥w  In the wake of the outbreak of the uprising, Hitler gave an oral order to Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Himmler and the Chief of Staff of the Supreme Command of the Land Forces (OKH), General Heinz Guderian, to level Warsaw with the ground and murder all its inhabitantsAntoni Przygo≈Ñski: Powstanie warszawskie w sierpniu 1944 r.

According to the SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Erich von dem Bach- Zelewski, who was appointed commander of the forces appointed to suppress the uprising, the order was more or less as follows: \\"Every inhabitant should be killed, no prisoners should be taken. Warsaw is to be razed to the ground and in this way a terrifying example is to be created for the whole of Europe\\"Antoni Przygo≈Ñski: Powstanie warszawskie w sierpniu 1944 r. T. I.

Despite this, the execution of Hitler's extermination order did not bring such tragic results in Mokot√≥w as in Wola, Ochota or in the Southern Downtown (≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie Po≈Çudniowe). The district was considered to be a peripheral section, so for a long time Germans did not carry out major offensive activities there. However, the German troops, passively behaving towards the insurgents, massacred the Polish civilians who were within their reachAdam Borkiewicz: Powstanie warszawskie.

On the first day of the uprising, the House of Writers of the Society of Jesus at 61 Rakowiecka Street was not included in the fighting. A dozen or so civilians hid in the monastery as the shooting prevented them from returning home. In the morning of August 2nd, the House of Writers was bombarded by German anti- aircraft guns from the nearby Mokotow Field, and soon afterwards it was invaded by an SS unit of about 20 people, most probably sent from the nearby Stauferkaserne. The SS officers accused the people staying in the monastery of shooting German soldiers from the building. After a brief search, which did not lead to finding any evidence to support these accusations, the Germans led Father Edward Kosibowicz, the Superior of the monastery, out of the building, allegedly to provide additional explanations to the command. In fact, he was murdered with a shot to the back of his head in the Mokotow FieldSzymon Datner, Kazimierz Leszczy≈Ñski (red.): Zbrodnie okupanta w czasie powstania warszawskiego w 1944 roku (w dokumentach).

The explosions injured 19 people. Background The rivalry between Ajax and Feyenoord football clubs, who hail from Amsterdam and Rotterdam respectively, is one of the fiercest in the continent. During the 1980s there has been a large number of significant hooligan incidents between the two clubs and amongst other Dutch clubs. Another major hooligan incident not related to the derby in 1989 was the Staafincident, when an Ajax hooligan threw a metal rod at the goalkeeper during a match against Austria Wien. Incident A Feyenoord hooligan threw the bombs, containing nails and fireworks, at a home section of the ground. Nineteen fans were hurt, nine of them seriously. Riot police immediately cleared the away section and searched all the away fans when exiting. The game continued as usual, ending in a 1-1 draw. Aftermath The incident was widely reported in national and international media.

II (II: Patres et scriptores ecclesiastici (gr.))of the Biblioteca Marciana Saint Leontios was born in Monemvasia in 1377, from an aristocratic family. His mother Theodora was a daughter of the emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos and his father Andrew was the governor of the Peloponnese. He was sent to Constantinople for advanced studies in Philosophy and Science. After he returned to Monemvasia and later he entered the monastic life. He visited Mount Athos and stayed for some time living an ascetic life. It was revealed to him that he should go to north Peloponnese to a specific area close to the modern city of Aigio, in Achaea region. After his arrival to this area under the Klokos Mountain he built a small church dedicated to the holy Archangels and he lived in a very inaccessible place continuing his ascetic life. With the support of his uncles Thomas Palaiologos and Demetrios Paleologos - who were impressed by the saintliness of their nephews life - he established the monastery of the Archangels Michael and Gabriel (known as the Monastery of Pammegiston Taxiarchon). The Palaeologos family donated relics of Saints to the monastery the most important of them being small portions of relics of the Holy Passion of the Lord (portion of the Holy Cross, the Crown of Thorns, the Sponge, the Purple Robe of the Lord). Today the Honorable Body of Saint Leontios is kept in a special shrine in the church of the Holy Archangels, inside the monastery. A church which bears his name is built in the town of Aigio.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. At the time of its nomination the district consisted of 36 resources, including 28 contributing buildings, and eight non-contributing buildings. The city of Waterloo was established in the early 1850s. Its first settlers started developing the west side of the city before crossing the Cedar River and developing east side. The first Black Hawk County Courthouse was built on the east side in 1856 and East Waterloo Township was created two years later. As industry began to develop along the river, and the arrival of the first railroad in 1861, the commercial district on the east side began to grow. Also on the east side of town was the terminus of the streetcar-turned-interurban system. By 1900, the city became one of the primary wholesale and retail centers in northeastern Iowa. In 1911 the Black population increased significantly as workers, primarily from Mississippi, moved into town to work for the Illinois Central Railroad. The following year the saloons in town were closed and bootlegging, gambling, drugs, and prostitution started to increase in the area surrounding the central business district. All of these developed put together created the atmosphere of the downtown commercial district. For the most part, the commercial buildings in the district are constructed of brick and are two to three stories in height. There are also several taller multi-story buildings located here, and they represent the \\"high water mark in the district‚Äôs physical development.\\" All of the buildings follow the styles popular at the time of their construction, including Italianate, Neoclassical, and Commercial. Architects who have buildings in the district include John Bartley, John T. Burkett, Howard B. Burr, Mortimer Cleveland, George Ellis, Hallett & Rawson, Emile G. Jehle, Josselyn & Taylor, Joseph C. Llewellyn, John G. Ralston, Fred G. Shaw, and Clinton P. Shockley. Fires in the 1920s and 1950s impacted the appearance of the district as most of the fire-damaged were given stylish new facades. Several other buildings were given updated facades in the 1940s and the 1950s. The buildings that do not contribute to the historic integrity of the district had their facades resurfaced in more recent decades. The Fowler Company Building (1884) and the Marsh-Place Building (1910) are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It is also called K2-234b. Its mass is 35.7 Earths, it takes 11.8 days to complete one orbit of its star, and is 0.105 AU from its star. It was discovered by 43 astrophysicists, one which is V. Van Eylen, and is announced in 2018.  Overview  The exoplanet HD 89345 b, which has a mass of 0.1 MJ and a radius of 0.61 RJ, was assigned to the class of ocean planets. The parent planet star of about 5.3 billion years old belongs to the spectral class G5V-G6V; it is 66 percent larger and 22 percent more massive than the Sun, and is 413 light- years away. The effective temperature of the star is 5609 Kelvin, and considering that HD 89345 b makes one revolution around the star in 11.8 days, being from it at a distance of 0.11 astronomical unit, This planet was described by researchers as a warm subterranean with an equilibrium temperature of 1059 Kelvin.  Discovery  HD 89345 b, the Saturn-sized exoplanet orbiting a slightly evolved star HD 89345, was discovered in 2018 using the transit photometry method, the process in which detects distant planets by measuring the minute dimming of a star as an orbiting planet passes between it and the Earth. It is the only planet orbiting around HD 89345, a G5 class star, situated in the constellation of Leo in 413 light-years from the Sun. This star is aged 9.4 billion years. HD 89345 b orbits its star in about 12 terrestrial days on an elliptical orbit. The orbit is closer to the star than the internal limit of the habitable zone. It has a low density and can be composed of gas. It has a low Earth similarity index (0.13) and should be very different from our planet. Its parent star, HD 89345, is a bright star (V = 9.3\\\\ mag ) observed by the K2 mission with one-minute time sampling. It exhibits solar-like oscillations. The data is conducted by asteroseismology to be able to determine the parameters of the star and find its mass and radius. Its mass is 1.12 \\\\tfrac{+0.04}{-0.01} M‚äïÔøΩ and its mean radius is 1.657 \\\\tfrac{+0.020}{-0.004} R‚äïÔøΩ. The star appears to have recently left the main sequence, based on the inferred age, 9.4 \\\\tfrac{+0.4}{-1.3} Gyr, and the non- detection of mixed modes. The star hosts a \\"warm Saturn\\" (P = 11.8\\\\sim days, R_p = 6.86 \\\\pm 0.14\\\\ R\\\\oplus ).

Goatourism.Org, cited by Goanet lists traditional occupations such as the khumbar (potter), the chamar (cobbler), the mahar (bamboo and cane crafts person), the barber, and practitioners of other professions like the shetty (goldsmith), zo (idol makers who sculpt statues of wood and ivory), chari (blacksmiths), chittari (lacquer work artisans), and kansar (brass lamp and copper vessel makers). In her book on Goa's traditional salt industry, Reyna Sequeira describes how prominent Goa's traditional salt industry once was, but has now shrunk to make its presence felt in just a handful of villages. Historian Teotonio R. de Souza, in his book Goa To Me, describes Goa's traditional crafts which \\"were organized in their own castes which were endogamous and ensured both the continuity of a craft needed by the community as well as the accumulation of skill through generations of practice in the same family.\\" He mentions the guns manufactured by the blacksmiths in Goa (and mentions Cuncolim, where the manufacture of guns was banned by a Portuguese viceroy), carpenters producing household furniture and agricultural implements, kharvis (traditional fishermen) who had a \\"variety of nets that were meant for catching different types of fish (koblem, mag, kanttai, zau, ramponn, kann'ni, paguer, etc)\\" He also refers to craft associations associated with \\"palm products, supplying brooms, spoons, ropes, coir mattresses, woven leaves, oil, toddy, vinegar, arrack, palm sugar\\".

Early years  Born on a farm in Bryant, Indiana, in September 1878, Charles Calmer Hart was the son of a schoolteacher. His first jobs included farming and working in a factory. Though he never attended high college or university, he became a printer's devil at the Geneva Herald, in Indiana, before joining the Muncie Star, now The Star Press. In 1897, he moved west, and joined the staff of the San Francisco Call as a reporter, before enlisting in the United States Army. As a soldier, he served as a private in the Third Regiment of Artillery, either in Battery K, or Battery L. During his military service, Hart served as a guard on Alcatraz Island during its usage as Alcatraz Citadel, an Army prison, and was seriously injured: while climbing the steps of the lighthouse, possibly to paint the roof, the stairwell gave way under him, dropping him thirty feet into the rocks below, fracturing his leg, which required the amputation of his leg below the knee. Though there is some dispute regarding Hart's supposed service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, it is known that Hart's injuries necessitated a year of convalescence, including some time at the Soldiers' Home. As a result of the amputation, he received a pension, and used a prosthetic foot and a cane for the rest of his life.  Newspaperman  He soon returned home to Indiana, rejoining the Muncie Star, this time as an editor; he later joined The Indianapolis Star as an editor, as well; during this time, as a young reporter, he provided Gene Stratton-Porter with her first newspaper mention, on the strength of her reporting in the Decatur Journal. He next worked for other newspapers around the country, mainly in the West, including The Spokesman-Review, where he served as city editor; and The Oregonian, where he served as a Washington, D.C. correspondent. In addition, he was also a correspondent with the Boise-based Capital-News, and the Minneapolis Tribune, the latter of which is now the Star Tribune. While in Washington, furthermore, Hart served as the secretary of the National Press Club three times.  Politics  Hart was active in politics as a Republican. He supported Charles Evans Hughes during the 1916 presidential campaign, though his first candidate was Senator William Borah. Additionally, for three years, he was the secretary and campaign manager for Republican progressive William La Follette. Hart ran for Congress in 1916, in Washington's 5th congressional district, but lost the Republican primary. In November, Clarence Dill, one of his former reporters, was re-elected.  Personal life  On April 21, 1917, Hart married Ruth Agnes Limond in Seattle. The two had met in Coronado, California, during Hart's campaign for Hughes. For Hart, this was his second marriage; he had earlier married Bertha Hall, with whom he had a daughter. With Ruth Limond, Hart had two children, a son, John; and a daughter, Priscilla.  Albania  President Calvin Coolidge nominated Hart as the second minister to Albania in May 1925; he took up his post later that year. Hart's reports during his service as minister to Albania were widely considered entertaining and funny, including by the Secretary of State, Frank B. Kellogg, and others in the Foreign Service, as they were written in a vivid and realistic style, more suited to journalism than diplomacy. Well-liked by Albanian officials, Hart, like Albanian president Zogu, proved to be wily and careful, especially when dealing with newspaper reporters; apposite, as Hart taught Zogu how to play poker. During his time as minister, Albania became a monarchy under Zogu, now King Zog I; President Coolidge recognized the new Albanian government, as one properly created under the constitutional mechanisms of the Albanian Republic; and Zog personally dedicated the new United States Embassy in Tirana, with its large twelve rooms and lavish furnishings, which, with some modifications and renovations, remains the embassy today. At the time, King Zog was a bachelor, and it was later reported that he reached out to Hart for the diplomat's assistance in finding a wealthy, politically courageous, and beautiful American bride, someone to help him Westernise his country, and that Hart had sent back a list of names, including Natalie Hays Hammond, whom Zog rejected due to lack of wealth. Minister Hart denied the entire account. In the end, Zog would get part of his wish: in 1938, he married Geraldine Apponyi, an impecunious Hungarian-American countess. By then, however, Hart had left as minister; he was replaced by Herman Bernstein in 1930.  Persia  After some time back in the United States, Hart was nominated by President Herbert Hoover as minister to Iran (then known as Persia) in October 1929. The United States Senate confirmed his nomination in November; and during Hart's journey to Iran, he passed through the Soviet Union, which was uncommon and made him the first American diplomat in twelve years to have done so, presumably at the behest of the State Department. As minister to Persia, Hart was considered \\"energetic and popular\\"; as one Iranian newspaper stated, he \\"understands the Orient and the oriental mentality\\". Hart's reports continued to be humorous, and, to the admonishment of his colleagues and State Department officials, candid; yet when a report of such nature was received by Henry L. Stimson, Kellogg's successor, replete with calls for disciplinary actions, Stimson demurred. Hart, during his time in Iran, was able to observe and report on the beginnings of Iranian modernism, including the actions and creations of the Society for the National Heritage of Iran, and municipal modernization under Reza Shah. Though he was successful in persuading the government to allow James Henry Breasted to conduct an archaeological restoration there, most of his tenure involved responses to crises, including the 1930 Salmas earthquake and its aftermath, as well as the kidnapping of American consular officers, by Lurs near Sahneh, in 1932. In 1933, he resigned as minister, and was replaced with William H. Hornibrook.  Later years  After leaving his second diplomatic post, Hart worked in oil and gas exploration in the Middle East. In 1936, for instance, Hart, backed by the former Secretary of the Treasury, Ogden L. Mills, and joined by Frederick Gardner Clapp, helped negotiate oil rights in Afghanistan for an American firm, at the request of the Afghan and Persian governments. During World War II, Hart sought to open another front in Albania; his mission was canceled some time before he boarded his flight, the \\"Yankee Clipper\\", which would crash on February 22, 1943, leaving fifteen survivors, including Jane Froman. In March 1946, Hart, as the president of the American Friends of Albania group, rebuked Senator Claude Pepper on the Senator's position on Epirus in a newspaper advertisement. Hart's health began to fail that year; in late 1946, he stayed at Bethesda Naval Hospital for several months, after a series of operations relating to complications stemming from his Alcatraz injury. Hart also collected documents and autographs, some of which were auctioned off in February 1947. The next year, Charles Calmer Hart moved to California, where he died on November 17, 1956, in Los Angeles, at the age of 78. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

In celebration a large street party ceremony of up to 250,000 people took place in Coolsingel in Rotterdam city centre. Trouble from about 100 to 150 youngsters and hooligans soon broke out who clashed with police on Stadsplein. Shortly after, shops and property were smashed in wide-scale looting in Lijnbaan, with windows of 93 stores smashed. Riot police used water cannons to disperse the crowd. Officers were also forced to open fire, shooting four hooligans. Altogether 16 people were injured, whilst 80 were arrested. It is thought hooligans fired back at police. These were some of the worst instances of hooligan violence in the country. Aftermath The violence caused 10 million guilders in damages. Furthermore, four people were hospitalised, including a Feyenoord supporter who was shot in the stomach. It was later reported that most of the hooligans were simply opportunistic, with only loose connections to the football club.

Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador overcame Ricardo Anaya, Jos√© Antonio Meade, and Jaime Rodriguez Calderon in a landslide election on 1 July 2018. His election was the first since 1988 that a president-elect's political party has also won the outright majority in both the Senate and Chamber of Deputies. He is the oldest man to become President of Mexico at inauguration at age of 65. Events prior to presidency L√≥pez Obrador participated in the 2006 and 2012 elections, losing to Felipe Calderon (by a 0.6% margin) and Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, respectively. After the loss in 2012, he left the Party of the Democratic Revolution to found the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) which would later become a political party in 2014. Timeline Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador gave his daily press conference at the Palacio del Ayuntamiento in Mexico City. L√≥pez Obrador's political party MORENA would form the coalition Juntos Haremos Historia with left-wing Labor Party and socially conservative right-wing Social Encounter Party ‚Äì attracting controversy with the latter.

The coalition also managed to win 5 governorships, among them Mexico City's. President Pe√±a Nieto meets with Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador at the National Palace Following L√≥pez Obrador's victory, he would go on to meet current President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto at the National Palace. At the meeting he said that he would not travel with armed people in a break with what the Mexican presidency usually does. He declared that he will take a 60% salary pay cut. From 22 October to 25 October, he held a nationwide referendum on whether or not the New International Airport for Mexico City was to be scrapped, citing that the project was rife with graft and a waste of taxpayer money. About 70% of the results voted against the continuation of the project. L√≥pez Obrador insists on expanding the Santa Luc√≠a Air Force Base instead. International reaction L√≥pez Obrador's victory was met by various reactions around the world. Congratulations came from world politicians that included Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump. Personnel Campaign team At the helm of L√≥pez Obrador's campaign team was Tatiana Clouthier, Alfonso Romo, and Yeidckol Polevnsky Gurwitz. The regional coordinators throughout the nation were Marcelo Ebrard, Bertha Luj√°n (es), Ricardo Monreal, Julio Scherer Ibarra, and Rabindranath Salazar Solorio. Transition team Most of the people in L√≥pez Obrador's campaign team joined his transition team in order to prepare for the inauguration and the subsequent 6-year presidential term that will last from 1 December 2018 to 30 September 2024. Proposed cabinet In December 2017, L√≥pez Obrador released his cabinet listing, composed of 8 men and 8 women. He proposed dispersing the cabinet throughout the country's states, with the objective of ‚Äúpromoting development throughout the national territory,‚Äù while the Presidency, the Secretariat of National Defense, Secretariat of the Navy, the Secretariat of the Interior, Secretariat of Foreign Affairs, and the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit remain in the capital. In December 2017, he presented his proposed cabinet: *Olga S√°nchez Cordero as Secretary of the Interior *H√©ctor Vasconcelos as Secretary of Foreign Affairs* *Carlos Manuel Urz√∫a Mac√≠as as Secretary of Finance *Maria Luisa Albores as Secretary of Social Development *Josefa Gonz√°lez Blanco Ortiz Mena as Secretary of Environment *Roc√≠o Nahle as Secretary of Energy *Graciela M√°rquez Col√≠n as Secretary of Economy *Esteban Moctezuma Barrag√°n as Secretary of Education *V√≠ctor Villalobos as Secretary of Agriculture *Javier Jim√©nez Espri√∫ as Secretary of Communications *Irma Er√©ndira Sandoval as Secretary of the Civil Service *Jorge Alcocer Varela as Secretary of Health *Luisa Mar√≠a Alcalde Lujan as Secretary of Labor *Rom√°n Meyer Falc√≥n as Secretary of Agrarian Development and Urban Planning *Miguel Torruco Marqu√©s as Secretary of Tourism *Alejandra Frausto Guerrero as Secretary of Culture Replacements H√©ctor Vasconcelos was replaced by Marcelo Ebrard on 5 July 2018. Presidency Inauguration On 1 December 2018, Obrador was inaugurated at the Legislative Palace of San L√°zaro at 11:00 am. He was accompanied from left to right by: Mart√≠ Batres Guadarrama (President of the Senate), Enrique Pe√±a Nieto (Outgoing President), Porfirio Mu√±oz Ledo (President of the Chamber of Deputies), and Luis Mar√≠a Aguilar (President of the Supreme Court of Justice); guarded three cadets of each of the branches of the armed forces (one from the Heroic Military Academy, a female cadet of the Escuela Militar de Aviaci√≥n and one of the Heroica Escuela Naval Militar). After the reception and announcement of the leader of the legislature, he pronounced the text contained in article 87 of the Constitution of Mexico. At the end of the phrase \\"the people have given me,\\" he added the words \\"democratically\\". Then the transfer was made from the presidential sash, as indicated by the law, the president projection of delivery to the Congress and this to the new owner. Obrador was first to give a speech to the Congress since 2000, after the inauguration of Felipe Calderon. At the end of the speech, he was honored with the Himno Nacional Mexicano. The foreign representation at the inauguration included the attendance of 14 heads of state and government:La toma de posesi√≥n de AMLO ser√° la m√°s concurrida en la historia de M√©xico * Felipe VI, King of Spain * Miguel D√≠az-Canel (President of Cuba) * Evo Morales (President of Bolivia) * Mart√≠n Vizcarra (President of Peru) * Juan Orlando Hern√°ndez (President of Honduras) * Jimmy Morales (President of Guatemala) * Len√≠n Moreno (President of Ecuador) * Iv√°n Duque M√°rquez (President of Colombia) * Brahim Gali (President of Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic) * Colville Young (Governor General of Belize) * Julie Payette (Governor General of Canada) * Danilo Medina (President of the Dominican Republic) * Jovenel Mo√Øse (President of Haiti) * Ant√≥nio Costa (Prime Minister of Portugal) President of Venezuela Nicol√°s Maduro did not attend the inauguration ceremony, but did attend a reception in the National Palace. Representatives from 37 countries, including the United States, China, Singapore, Azerbaijan, Brazil, Russia, and Ukraine also attended. Fulfilling a campaign promise, he opened Los Pinos to the public later on 1 December and simultaneously moved the presidential offices back to the National Palace. After inauguration Lopez Obrador gave his Primer Informe del Gobierno (State of the Union address) on September 1, 2019, before 400 legislators, governors, and business leaders. During his hour-and- a-half speech, he emphasized how he has eliminated a lot of corruption and helped the poor. The speech generated 125,000 tweets and 27,000,000 viewers. =Foreign policy= Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez and President Obrador during the former's arrival ceremony. He as December 2019, has not visited any foreign country since assuming office, often saying that \\"The best foreign policy is domestic policy\\". Despite this, in his first year, he had hosted multiple foreign leaders in Mexico City, including Pedro S√°nchez of Spain in January and Miguel Diaz Canel of Cuba and Carlos Alvarado Quesada of Costa Rica in October. During the 2019 Bolivian political crisis, President Evo Morales was granted the right of political asylum by Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard at the direction of Obrador. Obrador justified his actions in a press conference the following day, taking the position alongside other governments such as Cuba, Venezuela, and Argentina that Morales was the victim of a political coup d'√©tat. Morales later went to Argentina, and the Bolivian government issued a warrant for his arrest on December 18. Days later, Bolivia deployed a large number of security forces outside the embassy and ambassador's residence in La Paz, and the Mexican government claimed they were intimidating, harassing, and photographing diplomats. On July 8, 2020 He made his first foreign trip as President to Washington, D. C. where he met with President Donald Trump at the White House. =Military and security= Shortly after his inauguration, he dissolved the Estado Mayor Presidencial (Presidential Guard), an institution charged with protecting and safeguarding the President of Mexico and the First Lady of Mexico. In December 2018, L√≥pez Obrador ordered the creation of a truth commission to re-examine one of the country's most notorious unsolved crimes: the kidnapping and presumed murder of 43 trainee teachers who disappeared after they were attacked by cartel gunmen and corrupt police officers. On March 1, 2019, Obrador said that he will open up the General National Archives to show how intelligence agencies, particularly the CISEN, targeted activists and opposition groups during the Dirty War.Mexico's president opens archives on 'dirty war period. 1 March 2019 During the presidency of L√≥pez Obrador, the traditional Revolution Day civil- military-athletic parade on 20 November was reinstated that same year (2019) after 5 years. Before becoming President, Obrador campaigned on a promise to take the military off the streets of Mexico. In keeping with this promise, he released a plan to create a Mexican National Guard under control of the military and the Secretariat of Security and Civilian Protection (which was itself established by Obrador) and would be in charge of \\"preventing and combating crime\\". It was the merger of elite parts of the Federal police, Military police, Navy, Chief of Staff's Guard and other top Mexican Security agencies Obrador stated that the creation of a new National Guard would be critical to solving Mexico's ongoing security crisis. On 28 February, the Congress of the Union voted to approve a 60,000-member agency, which was officially established on 30 June 2019. By early 2020, Obrador restored the Naval Infantry Corps' role in fighting drug cartels, and he relied on the military for tasks such as law enforcement and construction. Ovidio Guzm√°n L√≥pez, a high-ranking member of the Sinaloa Cartel and son of Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n was briefly arrested in Culiac√°n by members of the National Guard in October 2019, setting off an operation which resulted in several deaths and Guzm√°n's release by authorities. Hours later, Ovidio Guzm√°n was freed, and President Obrador supported the decision in order to \\"prevent more bloodshed\\" as well as \\"a massacre\\". =Drug war= One of his campaign promises in relation to the Mexican Drug War was a controversial \\"strategy for peace\\": a program to give amnesty to all Mexicans involved in the production and trafficking of drugs. It was proposed as a way to stop the drug trade and the turf violence that spread as a result as well as act as a deterrent to other people from following that path, particularly low-income young people and poor farmers. President Obrador pointed out that contrary to his proposed plan, past approaches failed because they were based on a misunderstanding of the core problem, which according to him, is the country's social disparities that resulted from economic policies of past presidencies in the years prior that caused the drug problem in the first place which in turn have turned the country into a hotbed of the illegal drug trade globally. On 30 January 2019, President Obrador declared the end of the Mexican war on drugs, stating that he will now focus on reducing spending and will direct military/police/National Guard efforts on armed gasoline theft rings (locally known as huachicolero) that have been stealing more than 70 thousand barrels of oil, diesel and gasoline daily from the nation's gas pipelines.

Description The long tributary emerges above ground south of NW 20th Street between 15th and 17th avenues, from there it flows southeast in a straight line towards 15th Street, then east through Civic Center, it makes a sharp turn south along 12th Avenue for one block until 14th Street. From 14th Street, it runs again in a southeast direction passing under SR836 towards 11th Street, where it becomes a canal known as the Seybold Canal. Passing south of 11th Street it goes through the neighborhoods of Spring Garden to the west and Overtown to the east. From 11th Street it continues southeast (in a straight line) until 8th street, and then straight south for three blocks until it meets the Miami River west of NW 5th Street and 7th Avenue. History Early settlements The lower area of the creek (now known as the Seybold Canal) was first settled in the early 1840s when William English established a coontie starch mill in the area. By the 1850s, William Wagner and a business partner reestablished a coontie mill near the tributary which would later bear Wagner's name. A freshwater spring was found on the tributary in the area, which caused Henry Flagler to build the private Miami Water Company (where a Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Treatment plant is currently located) there in 1899. The Seybold Canal By 1919, German-born Miami industrialist John Seybold dredged Wagner Creek and constructed a turning basin in the creek, prompting area officials to rename the creek \\"Seybold Canal\\" in his honor; Seybold purchased and platted the peninsular plot of land immediately south of Northwest 11th Street between the River and Creek for private, residential development, advertising it as one of Miami's premier housing communities into the Florida land boom of the 1920s.

No longer a freshwater creek, it was instead used as a dumping ground for various types of chemicals, garbage, fecal matter and stormwater runoff from the surrounding area. In 2003, the City of Miami submitted a maintenance dredging request on Wagner Creek upstream of NW 11th Street. As part of the approval process, samples of sediments and water were taken from the creek and tested. The results showed that a high percentage of dioxins, heavy metals and other contaminants were present. However, no further action was taken due to the Army Corps of Engineers dredging of the Miami River which took about five years. Between 2007 and 2009, a company called CH2M HILL hired by the city conducted further tests determined that about 61 tons of contaminated sediments needed to be removed. Finally in February 2015, the city announced that $20 million had been approved for the cleanup. On July 31, 2017 members of the City Commission and the Miami River Commission gathered in a ceremony to announce the beginning of the process of restoring the creek.,http://www.miamitodaynews.com/2017/08/08/cleanup-polluted-wagner-creek- seybold-canal- begins/https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article9684407.html The restoration, including removal of sediments, garbage and rehabilitation, took about a year and ended in May 2018.https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/florida/explore/florida- wagner-creek-restoration.xml File:Wagner Creek in Miami - 09 View of creek under Metrorail pylons from NW 11th Street bridge.jpgView of creek under Metrorail pylons from NW 11th Street bridge (view northwest) File:Wagner Creek in Miami - 08 Seybold Canal near NW 9th Street (view northwest).jpgSeybold Canal near NW 9th Street (view northwest) File:Wagner Creek - Seybold Canal - downriver from 11th Street Bridge 01.jpgCanal downriver from 11th Street Bridge (turning basin in background) References Category:Rivers of Florida Category:Geography of Miami-Dade County, Florida Category:Bodies of water of Miami-Dade County, Florida ","title":"Wagner Creek (Florida)"},{"id":"57821045","text":"Tears-McFarlane House is a historic house located in Denver, Colorado that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on January 11, 1976.

James A Bedbrook (1845‚Äì1902), was born in Portsea, Hampshire, to James Albert Bedbrook and Elizabeth Sarah Cammell. He was married to Matilda Ann Crocker and they had ten children, including Major Ernest Arthur St George Bedbrook.https://ww1sacrifice.com/2015/10/27/major-ernest-arthur-st-george- bedbrook/ He was stationed in Devon, Hampshire, Kent and Malta and the family later lived in Haresfield House, Blenkarne Road, Wandsworth Common, London. Naval life Bedbrook entered the service in 1859, as an engineer student working in Portsmouth dockyard. He attended the Royal School of Naval Architecture in South Kensington and in 1867, was commissioned as assistant engineer on board HMS Warrior for sea service. Bedbrook went on to serve on HMS Trafalgar in 1870, touring through the Mediterranean. In 1871, he was appointed to Keyham Yard, as engineer officer. He spent 15 years stationed at Chatham Yard, Kent, as assistant to the chief engineer and then as chief engineer himself. He was soon promoted to the rank of inspector of machinery and spent time in Malta with the Mediterranean fleet. In 1898, Bedbrook was appointed as professional assistant to Sir John Durston, part of the Controller's Department at the Admiralty. At this time, steam pressures over 150 lb. in naval ships was rare and the tendency was to subject the boilers to a high degree of forced draught to get all the power, with leaky tubes becoming a source of trouble. The French type of Belleville boiler was introduced, practically doubling the steam pressure. Subsequently other types were adopted, and the Belleville boiler was dispensed with. James Bedbrook's rise through the service is as follows; * 1867: Assistant Engineer * 1869: Engineer * 1877: Chief Engineer * 1886: Fleet Engineer * 1889: Inspector of Machinery * 1894: Chief Inspector of Machinery James and Matilda Bedbrook Whilst serving in the Royal Navy, Bedbrook argued for better working conditions for his men, higher salaries and better social inclusion for the engineer ranks.His greatest role to posterity in regard to his career in the Royal Navy is his success in obtaining military rank (or titles) for engineers and technicians within the service as opposed to the civilian titles they previously held. Death Bedbrook retired in 1901 and the following year, aged 57, he died from the result of a serious operation, due to appendicitis. He was interred in West Norwood Cemetery.

Permanent Wave is a 1929 animated film which is presented by Carl Laemmle and is produced by Walter Lantz. The film, which was written and animated by Walter Lantz, Bill Nolan and Tom Palmer, features Oswald rescuing a mermaid, whom he has fallen in love with, from his captain on the ship that Oswald is controlling during the film. The film was recorded on Western Electric equipment, an early sound-on-film technique. The equipment was also used in another Oswald film entitled Oil's Well, which was released in the same year. Copyrighted on the 26th of July 1929, and released on the 30th of September the same year, the film was released by Universal Pictures, and thus, is part of Universal series of the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit films. Plot Oswald together with the mermaid. The film opens with Oswald comically rowing on a whale pulling a boat. This boat has a captain inside, who Oswald is a servant to. The captain, whilst on the ship, begins to feel hungry. So, the captain whistles a note to Oswald. Oswald is originally sleeping, but is woken up by the music note comically dragging him back to the ship by his nose. The captain then explains to Oswald that he is hungry, so Oswald agrees to go get him food. Oswald then attempts to bring the captain some soup. However, a duck flies onto the plate and eats the soup. However, the soup makes the duck obese, which means that the duck cannot fly away. The duck tries though, but nevertheless falls off the plate and onto the floor. Once Oswald realises that the duck ate the soup, he comically squeezes it back into the bowl from the duck. After that, the duck bits on Oswald's tail. This makes the bowl fly into the air and back down onto Oswald's head. The duck laughs and then flies off. After that, Oswald hears some music coming from the island. Using a bridge made of musical notes, he descends onto the island. This is where he discovers the mermaid. However the captain discovers their presence on the island and attempts to pursue both of them. He manages to capture the mermaid, whom he locks in a room on the boat. Whilst not captured, Oswald manages to get onto the boat, by comically making a water path-way to get onto the boat. After that, a thunderstorm occurs, where the boat is flung around and in one instance, comically spanked by the waves. The storm destroys the boat, as the waves throws the boat away. Oswald and the mermaid find land on a pole, where they passionately kiss. The captain spots them and tries to grab them. However, the waves drag him down and he drowns. The film ends with both Oswald and the mermaid sitting on the Universal logo. Characters In this film, there are three main characters. One of them is Oswald, who is the captain's servant. He falls in love with the mermaid and rescues her from the captain, who captures her and attempts to lock her in his ship. Another main character is the mermaid, who is first featured on an island with other sea animals playing some music.

On the right is Mytikas (2918 m), on the left Stefani (2909 m) The \\"Plateau of the Muses\\" with the mountain hut named after Christos Kakkalos, in the background the Stefani summit (2909 m) Christos Kakkalos (; Litochoro, 13 July 1882 ‚Äì 12 April 1976) was a Greek mountain guide. He led the 1913 expedition of the Swiss Daniel Baud-Bovy and Fr√©d√©ric Boissonnas and is considered the first climber to have ascended Mytikas, the highest peak of Mount Olympus (2918.80 m) in Greece.  Life  After three years of schooling he helped his family with work and hunting. The family Kakkalos owned a hut called Paliokalyva (Greek Œ†Œ±ŒªŒ±ŒπŒøŒ∫Œ¨ŒªœÖŒ≤Œ±, old hut) on the east side of Mount Olympus. They worked as lumberjacks and transported the wood to the water-driven sawmills in Prionia. As a child, Kakkalos became acquainted with the mountains and hunted up to the summit region the Balkan chamois. In the summer of 1913, he set out with the Swiss Baud-Bovy and Boissonnas to an expedition to the peaks of Mount Olympus and on 2 August 1913, the group succeeded in the first ascent of Mytikas. Further ascents were made in July 1919, 1921, and in September 1927 with 105 participants. In 1921 he led the Swiss topographer Marcel Kurz, who is considered the first-time climber of the Olympus summit Stefani (2909 m), and the Swiss engineer Fritz Kuhn. In 1931, he again led Daniel Baud-Bovy with a group of climbers. Until 1932 he spent the nights with the groups he guided in Paliokalyva. In 1930, the foundation stone was laid for the first mountain hut of Mount Olympus, the \\"Spilios Agapitos\\" hut. In 1937 he was appointed by the Greek Mountaineering Association as the official guide for the mountain. He led climbers, geologists, botanists, ambassadors, politicians, artists and tourists. The last time he reached the summit was in 1973, when he was 91 years old. Christos Kakkalos died on 12 April 1976. In 1984, a mountain hut on the plateau of the Muses (2680 m) was named after him.  The first ascent of Mytikas  On 28 July 1913, the Swiss Daniel Baud-Bovy and Fr√©d√©ric Boissonnas reached the place Litochoro (about 400 m). They hired the lumberjacks Christos Kakkalos and Nikos Bistikos to lead them to the summit of Mount Olympus. The next day they started the ascent. At noon they reached the monastery of Agios Dionysios (820 m), went from there to Petrostrouga (1940 m) and stayed there overnight. On 30 July, they reached the Muses Plateau (about 2600 m) and climbed the peaks of Profitis Elias and Toumba. With the peaks of Mytikas and Stefani in mind, they decided to descend again and stayed in a log cabin (probably in the Paliokaliva) near today's mountain hut Spilios Agapitos (2040 m). On 31 July, they wanted to cancel their project and started their way back to Litochoro. During the descent, they changed their mind and stayed in Prionia (1100 m). On 1 August, they climbed back up to the lumberjack hut. On the morning of 2 August 1913, the two Swiss, their guides and two shepherds, who were hired to carry the heavy photographic equipment, left the lumberjack hut for the summit region. It was raining, it was cold and foggy. On the way the two shepherds and the leader Nikos Bistikos stayed behind. When the trio had climbed the supposed summit, they realized they had made a mistake when they saw the Mytikas above them. Kakkalos took the photo equipment and began the final ascent. A short time later, they climbed at 10.25 clock the summit of Mount Olympus.Giannis Kiritsis Olympus, by Fr√©d√©ric Boissonnas, Edition Dion-Olympus Municipality 2018, pages 27 to 31.

It was featured in the Governments plans for the railway in November 2017 and in July 2018 further details were revealed as part of the Connecting Leeds Vision with the consultation inviting opinions from the general public. It is anticipated by the developers that Cottingley railway station will close due to the proximity of the two stations. History The planned station will serve the White Rose Centre and the Millshaw Business Park, and its location would be south of railway station. The council are considering whether to retain Cottingley station or to close it, when White Rose opens. Speculation about the closure of Cottingley railway station has only been from the community who have pointed out that the station attracts only 265 passengers a day on average. The station is to be financed from the ¬£173.5 million Department for Transport money that was given to Leeds City Council but left without portfolio when the trolleybus scheme across Leeds was denied permission by Patrick McLoughlin. The funds need to be used by the financial year 2020-2021. The station was approved by Leeds City Council in June 2020, with two platforms and a service pattern of two trains per hour in each direction. The developers have stated that this will probably lead to the closure of the nearby Cottingley railway station, but this has not been confirmed by Northern, Leeds City Council or the Department for Transport. The planned opening for the new station is May 2022, with an estimated cost of ¬£22 million. Each platform will be capable of accepting six carriage trains, with scope to expand the length to accommodate eight car trains.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. At the time of its nomination it consisted of 65 resources, which included 56 contributing buildings, one contributing site and eight non-contributing buildings. This six block section of Central Avenue is located on the north side of the central business district. The largely linear district includes a jog at 18th Street. Below the jog the street was originally named Clay Street and above it Couler Avenue. It was also the dividing line where all commerce used the German language exclusively to the north. At one time the street featured a streetcar route and it was a significant farm-to-market route and a gateway into the city from the north. The period of significance for the district covers the years 1856 to 1919, but its historic commercial development occurred during the 1870s and 1880s. The buildings were constructed in brick and are largely two to three stories tall. There are also several single-story buildings and one that is four stories tall. The Italianate and the Queen Anne are dominant. Nine of the buildings are major commercial blocks. In addition to the commercial buildings, there is the two-story, brick, former Fire Engine House Number 1 that faces south at the jog in the street. The buildings in the district are considered some of the best examples of late-19th-century commercial designs in the city.

After the work of Wiman, the theory was developed by other mathematicians, and extended to more general classes of analytic functions. The main result of the theory is an asymptotic formula for the function and its derivatives near the point where the maximum modulus of this function is attained. Maximal term and central index By definition, an entire function can be represented by a power series which is convergent for all complex z: f(z)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_nz^n. The terms of this series tend to 0 as n\\\\to\\\\infty, so for each z there is a term of maximal modulus. This term depends on r:=z. Its modulus is called the maximal term of the series: \\\\mu(r,f)=\\\\max_k a_kr^k=:a_nr^n,\\\\quad r\\\\geq 0. Here n is the exponent for which the maximum is attained; if there are several maximal terms, we define n as the largest exponent of them. This number n depends on r, it is denoted by n(r,f) and is called the central index. Let M(r,f)=\\\\max\\\\\\\\{ f(z): z\\\\leq r \\\\\\\\} be the maximum modulus of the function f. Cauchy's inequality implies that \\\\mu(r,f)\\\\leq M(r,f) for all r\\\\geq 0. The converse estimate M(r,f)\\\\leq (\\\\mu(r,f))^{1+\\\\epsilon} was first proved by Borel, and a more precise estimate due to Wiman reads M(r,f)\\\\leq \\\\mu(r,f)\\\\left(\\\\log\\\\mu(r,f)\\\\right)^{1/2+\\\\epsilon}, in the sense that for every \\\\epsilon>0 there exist arbitrarily large values of r for which this inequality holds. In fact, it was shown by Valiron that the above relation holds for \\"most\\" values of r: the exceptional set E for which it does not hold has finite logarithmic measure: \\\\int_E\\\\frac{dr}{r}<\\\\infty. Improvements of these inequality were subject of much research in the 20th century. The main asymptotic formula The following result of Wiman is fundamental for various applications: let z_r be the point for which the maximum in the definition of M(r,f) is attained; by the Maximum Principle we have z_r=r. It turns out that f(z) behaves near the point z_r like a monomial: there are arbitrarily large values of r such that the formula f(z)=(1+o(1))\\\\left(\\\\frac{z}{z_r}\\\\right)^{n(r,f)}f(z_r), holds in the disk z-z_r<\\\\frac{r}{\\\\left(n(r)\\\\right)^{1/2+\\\\epsilon}}. Here \\\\epsilon>0 is an arbitrary positive number, and the o(1) refers to r\\\\to\\\\infty,\\\\; r ot\\\\in E, where E is the exceptional set described above. This disk is usually called the Wiman-Valiron disk. Applications The formula for f(z) for z near z_r can be differentiated so we have an asymptotic relation f^{(m)}(z)=(1+o(1))\\\\left(\\\\frac{n(r)}{z}\\\\right)^m\\\\left(\\\\frac{r}{z_r}\\\\right)^{n(r)}f(z_r). This is useful for studies of entire solutions of differential equations. Another important application is due to Valiron who noticed that the image of the Wiman-Valiron disk contains a \\"large\\" annulus (\\\\\\\\{ z:r_1<z where both r_1 and r_2/r_1 are arbitrarily large). This implies the important theorem of Valiron that there are arbitrarily large discs in the plane in which the inverse branches of an entire function can be defined. A quantitative version of this statement is known as the Bloch theorem. This theorem of Valiron has further applications in holomorphic dynamics: it is used in the proof of the fact that the escaping set of an entire function is not empty. Later development In 1938, Macintyre found that one can get rid of the central index and of power series itself in this theory. Macintyre replaced the central index by the quantity a(r,f):=r\\\\frac{M'(r,f)}{M(r,f)} and proved the main relation in the form f^{(m)}(z)=(1+o(1))\\\\left(\\\\frac{a(r,f)}{z}\\\\right)^m\\\\left(\\\\frac{z}{z_r}\\\\right)^{a(r,f)}f(z_r)\\\\quad\\\\mbox{for} \\\\quadz-z_r\\\\leq\\\\frac{r}{(a(r,f))^{1/2+\\\\epsilon}}. This statement does not mention the power series, but the assumption that f is entire was used by Macintyre. The final generalization was achieved by Bergweiler, Rippon and Stallard who showed that this relation persists for every unbounded analytic function f defined in an arbitrary unbounded region D in the complex plane, under the only assumption that f(z) is bounded for z\\\\in\\\\partial D. The key statement which makes this generalization possible is that the Wiman-Valiron disk is actually contained in D for all non-exceptional r.

Sallows was a professional photographer from Goderich, Ontario, a Canadian photographer known for his \\"portraits of children posed in bucolic settings, as well as for his lovingly humorous depictions of country youth.\\" He was an adopter of the pictorialism movement in Canada and a frequent contributor to Canadian Pictorial magazine. Early life Sallows was born on a farm in Huron County, not far from Goderich, Ontario. He left the farm in 1876 to look for work and was offered a job with a Goderich photographer, R.R. Thompson. Sallows accepted a three-year apprenticeship in 1878. He subsequently bought the entire business in 1881. He was married on August 23, 1882, at which point he was already \\"a well-known photographer\\". Style and business 1915 newspaper for Reuben Sallows' shop in Goderich Sallows' started his career as a portrait photographer before progressing to landscape photography near the end of the 19th century. His many travels lead him from agricultural settings to wilderness areas of Canada. He is said to also have photographed the Doukhobors in British Columbia, but none of these photographs have been found. Numerous photographs were sent overseas to companies that no longer exist. As of the 1990s, it was uncertain if any of these photographs exist in overseas archives. Sallows' photographs \\"are meant to call to mind the quintessential country lad who is self-reliant, loves adventure, and lives in harmony, but who can also be impulsive and mischievous\\". He was also known as a \\"rogue photographer\\" who travelled to the small towns, farmlands and into the expansive Canadian wilderness of Ontario, northern Quebec and the eastern provinces. He travelled with his camera in a black Ford Model A truck, in a canoe or by train as he travelled across Canada between 1881 and 1937. In addition to portraits, he also sold his photographs to postcard and lithograph companies in Canada, the United States, Germany and Great Britain. Many of his portraits were published in newspapers and magazines of the era, including one in National Geographic magazine in 1920. He also counted among his customers the governments of Canada and the provinces of Alberta and Ontario. Sallows offered photo-finishing in his shop, highlighting Kodak products in a 1915 newspaper ad. Sallows' photographs were used by governments and farm periodicals \\"to help entice immigrants needed to develop southern Ontario.He did his job well, perhaps too well.\\" Sallows' many photographs of the \\"dairyqueens\\" of the era were often used in advertisements for dairy implement companies. He worked in an early style of pin-up girls: While obvious to viewers of the era, his photographs could be construed as fact when viewed with more modern eyes. The women shown were often pristine, showing little evidence of the actual work required on a dairy farm. The photographer hoped that his images would \\"portray the province's rurality in a positive light by capturing it in its best seasons.\\" Death Sallows died in a motor vehicle accident when his truck turned over in loose gravel after a blowout and pinned him to the ground in a ditch. He was driving south on Highway 21 near Kintail, Ontario, to photograph a local summer camp. \\"[...] Mr. Sallows was conscious when pulled from beneath his old car by members of a road construction gang working nearby. [...] Rushed the accident victim to Alexandra Hospital, and such was the elderly man's great strength that he refused help and walked to the building unaided, in spite of his grievous injuries. He died about fourteen hours later on Saturday morning.\\" His chest was crushed in the accident on July 30, 1937, forcing broken ribs into his lungs. He died of his injuries on July 31, 1937.

Its use was common in the last part of the nineteenth century and during most of the twentieth.  Terminology  The communion-plate is in Latin called patina, distinguishing it from the paten, which in Latin is called patena. The Vatican-approved English translation of documents such as the General Instruction of the Roman Missal hyphenates the name. The two words are also written separately, as in the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church and in Bishop Peter John Elliott's Liturgical Question Box. The unhyphenated term, \\"communion plate\\", is also used to mean in general eucharistic vessels plated with a precious metal, such as patens, chalices and ciboria. \\"Communion plate\\" (unhyphenated) is also used for what is more commonly called a \\"communion tray\\", holding bread in the form of a loaf or cubes or crackers or holding small cups of wine or grape juice, which are passed along the pews in some Protestant churches since the final years of the nineteenth century.  History  The custom of holding a small communion- plate under the chin when receiving the sacred host arose in the mid-19th century, and became widespread after 16 March 1876, when in response to an enquiry about the new practice, the Sacred Congregation of Rites said it had no objection to it. On 26 March 1929 the Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments ordered its use by communicants, who were to hold it under their chin and then return it to the priest or pass it to the next communicant.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 1929, p. 638 In October of the following year, the same Congregation approved, in answer to a query, an alternative custom that had developed in some countries, in which the communion-plate was held under the communicant's chin, not by the communicant but by an altar server. The Congregation continued to require the use everywhere of a white linen cloth or veil stretched below the mouths of communicants, as prescribed by the Roman Missal.Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae, X, 6 in all editions of the Roman Missal from that of Pope Clement VIII in 1604 (inclusive) to that of Pope John XXIII in 1962 (exclusive) This has been called the communion cloth or the houseling cloth. A photograph of its continued use in 2013 within the sanctuary of a church appears in an online report on a priestly ordination in a Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter church. It can also be attached to the altar rails. In his 1960 Code of Rubrics, Pope John XXIII mentioned \\"the Communion plate for the faithful\\" (patina pro fidelium Communione) as one of the objects to be placed on the credence table before Mass. Two years later, he revised the Roman Missal, removing the rubric about the communion cloth and inserting a mention of the communion-plate, saying that the celebrant \\"puts into the chalice any fragments that may be found on the communion-plate that was placed under the chin of the communicants\\".Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae, X, 7, in Missale Romanum 1962, p. lxiii That the communion-plate replaced the cloth is a view mentioned by Monsignor Charles Pope and others.  Twenty-first century practice  The 2002 edition of the Roman Missal refers twice to the communion-plate: it retains the mention of it as an item to be placed on the credence table, and speaks of its use in administering Communion from the chalice by intinction to the faithful, who are to hold it themselves.General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 287 The 2004 Instruction Redemptionis sacramentum says: \\"The Communion-plate for the Communion of the faithful should be retained, so as to avoid the danger of the sacred host or some fragment of it falling.\\" The organization Catholics United for the Faith says that use of the communion-plate is obligatory even where communion in the hand is authorized, and that it is held under the communicants' chin by an altar server, not by the communicants themselves. However, since the liturgical books describe use of the communion-plate only in relation to intinction, Bishop Peter J. Elliott says that the prescription of the placing of a communion-plate on the credence table before Mass can be interpreted as meaning that this can be required only for a Mass in which intinction will be used: at other Masses use of a communion-plate is a licit option and cannot be forbidden, but is not obligatory. Bishop Elliott says that the custom of using a communion-plate continues in some churches, \\"especially where the option for kneeling for Communion has been retained\\". One church has its altar servers (who are equipped also with towels) hold the communion-plates (which it calls \\"patens\\") under the chin of those who receive the host on the tongue and under the hands of those who receive it in their hands. Monsignor Charles Pope says that what he calls chin patens or communion patens \\"are always used in the Traditional Latin Mass [...] some parishes even use it in the Ordinary Form.\\" The 2008 Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church says that the communion- plate has become \\"obsolescent\\". The abbreviated Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, published in 2013, speaks of the communion-plate as, \\"in the RC Church, a plate of silver or metal gilt formerly held under the chin of communicants as they received the Sacrament\\".

Metsakalmistu was originally planned to be a public medieval cemetery. Eduard Vilde was the first to be buried in 1933. The original area of the cemetery was 24.2 hectares, but has since expanded to be 48.3 hectares. Metsakalmistu was officially opened in 1939. That same year, 15 people were buried in the cemetery.\\"Tallinnas abiellumisi rohkem kui s√ºnde\\". Rahvaleht, 12. jaanuar 1940, nr 10, lk 8 In 1939, the nearby Kloostrimetsa Farm cemetery was created, which eventually, through expansion, became part of an expanded Metsakalmistu. At first, the designers of the cemetery were unanimous about the general design requirements of the cemetery, but the area was still dominated by the appearance of a wild forest. Initially, the placement of crosses, girders, ranks, and the largest size of the calcareous stone were 80x50 cm. Subsequently, the use of natural barriers, such as grass slabs, has been applied and has been extended to include a moss bed cover, as well as the use of flower borders. The monumental gravestones are not recommended for the cemetery, but they still exist to a small extent. At present, the permissible maximum height for a pillar is 1.5 m. The main chapel of Metsakalmistu was built in 1936, with its main architect being Herbert Johanson. The chapel was vandalized by the Soviet Union after the establishment of the Estonian SSR, but in 1996 it was restored with the support of the Tallinn City Government. In 2006, a columbarium was built.

This species was previously known as Tellina simulans. The animal was originally described to science by naturalist Charles Baker Adams, a professor of zoology at Amherst College. Adams left for an expedition to Panama in mid-November 1850. He collected furiously upon arrival and on January 3, 1851 shipped eight crates back to Massachusetts. These contained 41,830 specimens of 516 species of molluscs. He described Tellina simulans on the basis of a single valve.  Description  The rose-red shells can reach 45 mm (1.8\\") long and 11mm (.4\\") in depth. The valves are connected by a short, prominent ligament. Lateral teeth are small or nonexistent. The valves are concentrically sculpted and more sharply triangular in cross-section than a similar Tellin, Eurytellina rubescens. Another difference between these two closely related species is that the pallial sinus does not touch the anterior adductor scar in E. simulans, while it does in E. rubescens.  Distribution and life history  These tellins live in the Eastern Pacific from Scammon's Lagoon, Baja California Sur, Mexico to Peru, including the Gulf of California. They live buried in sand and mud from the intertidal zone to 24 meters (78') deep. Like the rest of the tellins, they are filter feeders. They extend siphons up through the sand in order to breathe, strain nutrients from the water, spawn, and to excrete waste products.

He served in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and World War I. Biography Gaither was born on November 27, 1860, in Howard County, Maryland, on a farm two miles south of Ellicott City. His father was an officer who served the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War and the U.S. afterward. When he was a young man, Maryland saw some riots serious enough that the Fifth and Sixth Infantry regiments were called in to help. Gaither observed their actions, and it influenced his decision making when he later served on the Baltimore police Department. Gaither served in the Maryland Army National Guard, initially retiring in 1890 and called back into service in 1896. He participated in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, going to Cuba and holding a command in the Ninth (colored) U.S. Volunteer Infantry. Catching typhoid fever, they were mustered out and returned home. Gaither assumed command of the Fifth Maryland Veterans Corps after he became a colonel, and upon his promotion to brigadier general in 1912, he assumed command of the First Maryland Brigade. That same year, Gaither was in charge of an American rifle team that won an international tournament in Buenos Aires. He served on the Mexican border in 1917, and he also commanded Fort McClellan for a short time. After commanding the 58th Infantry Brigade, Gaither retired after he discovered he had a heart murmur. Maryland Governor Albert Ritchie appointed Gaither as the commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department, and he served in the position from 1920 to 1937, the longest tenure of anyone holding the position. Observers commented positively on his leadership in this position. Gaither died on March 29, 1947, after several weeks in the hospital. Personal life Gaither was married three times, with his first marriage ending in divorce and with his second wife dying. He had two daughters.

History After the independence and unification of Italy, the Italians were not self-sufficient in arms design and production. Foreign firms such as Armstrong, Krupp, Schneider, and Vickers all provided arms and helped establish local production of their designs under license. One of the models that the Italian Army bought was the Krupp 15 cm sFH 13. With Italy's entry into the First World War in 1915 on the side of the Entente Powers Krupp only produced 112 pieces for the Italians. However, before the start of the war, Ansaldo and Vickers-Terni had acquired a production license for the 15 cm sFH 13 which was given Italian classification Obice da 149/12. Although the overall length of the barrel is 14 calibers in length the Italians classified it as 12 calibers because the Italian system does not count the gun's breech. Design The 149/12 was a conventional artillery piece of the era with spoked wooden wheels with steel rims, a steel box trail carriage, a horizontal sliding-block breech, hydro-spring recoil system, a gun shield and used cased separate-loading charges and projectiles. The carriage had an open space behind the breech to accommodate high angles of elevation while the separate- loading system could accept up to 7 bags of propellant to vary velocity and range. The main difference between the models is their carriages and shields. Otherwise, their barrels remained the same. 1,500 guns of all three variants were produced. Variants * Obice da 149/12 Modello 1914 - This was the main production variant and is nearly identical to the 15 cm sFH 13. * Obice da 149/12 Modello 1916 - This version was considered a mountain gun with a narrower carriage and diameter wheels. * Obice da 149/12 Modello 1918 - This version's carriage was modified to allow the wheels to extend to allow extra clearance for the breech to recoil. This combined with a modified recoil mechanism and elevation mechanism allowed up to 65¬∞ of elevation. This model can be identified by the two seats for the gun crew on the tail of the carriage and the new curved gun shield.  Organization  A 149/12 battery consists of 4 howitzers, 4 Pavesi P4 tractors, 2 machine guns for close defense and 7 trucks. A 149/12 could be towed at and setup only take a few minutes. World War I All three models of the 149/12 were widely used by the Italians during the First World War and a number survived to be used in the Spanish Civil War and Second World War. World War II In addition to being used by Italy, the 149/12 was also exported to Albania and Bulgaria. It may have also been exported to Austria, Poland, and Spain. When Italy joined the Second World War in 1940, they had 580 Modello 1914 and 116 Modello 1918's in service, not having completed the replacement of this piece with the 149/13.

History  The origins of Sunspot as a Solar Observatory date back to the sudden increased interest of solar physics to the US military during the Second World War. In 1940, the High Altitude Observatory (HAO) was established in 1940 in Climax, Colorado, by Walter Orr Roberts and Donald Menzel. It was associated with both Harvard College Observatory and the University of Colorado and was incorporated in 1946. At the time it was the world's highest permanent observatory for astronomy, at an elevation of over 11,000 feet, and was designed purely for studying the Sun. Roberts worked with the Bureau of Standards, \\"forecasting radio conditions on the basis of solar observations\\". Such studies of the upper atmosphere were critical for predicting conditions for radio communication, guided missiles, and supersonic aircraft and, as a result, solar observations \\"became essential to the war effort\\". Suddenly the field of solar astronomy became an appealing goal for both astronomers and the military. The Sacramento Peak Observatory was conceived as a complementary telescope to the existing facilities in Climax, as Roberts had realized that \\"there were long periods of cloudiness, especially during the winter, when it was not possible to make observations\\", and hence a second dedicated solar observatory should be established. The practical applications for solar research, as discovered by the military during World War II, regarding the impact solar activity had on radio communication spurred the US Congress to provide for a military-funded observatory. It became an important mission of the USAF to establish a solar observatory and \\"after the war, when the Air Force recognized the need to organize its own long-range program of solar studies, it quite naturally turned for specialized assistance to the recently formed High Altitude Observatory (HAO)\\". In September 1947, the USAF issued a contract to HAO and Harvard University to conduct a survey and thereby identify an appropriate site for a new solar observatory and to determine which instruments to install at the new site. Any seasonal cloud cover at the new site needed to arrive in the opposite season to that at Climax, in order to then provide for year-round coverage of the Sun. Similar to Climax, the atmosphere above the new site should be exceptionally free from haze and dust in order to permit for the best possible observing. Roberts and Menzel examined the White Sands Proving Ground (an area used as a research rocket firing range near Holloman Air Force Base in Alamogordo, New Mexico). They \\"concluded that the section of the Sacramento Mountains in which Sacramento Peak is located would be especially promising for a solar research site. Further inquiries and inspection tended to confirm this initial reaction\\". Holloman Air Force Base could be used to supply the equipment and any supplies. Sacramento Peak was, at 9200 feet was also low enough to be more accessible to researchers than Climax at 11,000 feet and the thickly forested setting blocked interference from rising air currents up the mountain. A small crew of 5 made the initial camp at the Sunspot site. This crew included Roberts, John \\"Jack\\" W. Evans (a student of Menzel's), and Rudy Cook (who had worked with Robert in Climax). Cook's companions soon returned home, leaving Cook and his dog Rocky to man the site. By the end of 1947, Menzel and Roberts made the recommendation that Sacramento Peak be chosen as the solar research site for USAF. By April 1948, the Committee on Geophysical Sciences (then within the War Department's Research and Development Board) formally accepted this recommendation and a contract was written, mandating the Air Force to complete the observatory. The specifics of the contract called for \\"the preparation of detailed plans for an integrated solar research facility, which would combine observational, analytical, and data-reduction activities, all on a larger scale than at any comparable observatory; design, development, and fabrication of the required optical device; and concurrently, theoretical studies of solar structure and characteristics\\"  Views from Sunspot  On the western side of the Sacramento peak, there are wide open views of Apache Point Observatory and Sloan Digital Sky Survey telescopes. From the overlook beside the telescope, White Sands National Park stands out as gypsum white against the sandy background of the desert. On a clear day it is possible to see all the way south to the cities of El Paso, Texas, and Juarez, Mexico, and all the way north to the Trinity test site. The overlook can also be used for viewing rocket launches from White Sands Missile Range.

It consists of 27 villages and 424 households. Until 2011 it was three days' walk from three days' hike from Mongar town. Languages and origin The common language spoken in Khengkhar is Tshangla which is spoken throughout eastern Bhutan. Tshangla is believed to be part of the Tibeto-Burman language family. Livelihood Khengkher as a community has relatively few landholdings, which has implication for both subsistence and commercial agriculture. The water shortage in the area makes it difficult for farmers there to grow crops even at subsistence level. However, maize, wheat, beans and millet are grown for home consumption. The communities in these area make high-quality altar pieces and wooden masks. Women from Khengkher are known for weaving. Food Maize is the stable food. Its often prepared and eaten with rice, ground into flour for dough and sometimes boiled and eaten. Pumpkin, radish and chili are common vegetables grown and eaten in the community. Life-cycle celebration People of Khengkher celebrate the Chunyipa losar, or new year, on the first day of the 12th Bhutanese month with local sports, games, feasting and dance. It's a time where whole family gets together. Birth is likewise joyous occasion. Three days after a child is born, an astrologer is consulted to prepare keytsea birth chart indicating the child's astrologically determined tendencies during his or her life. Upon death village astrologer fixes the day for crimination. Development and social change The block has two schools, khengkher lower secondary school and Udric community school. It also has one basic health unit. Recently the gewog blockhas constructed farm road.

The oldest rocks in the state were metamorphosed during the Grenville orogeny, a mountain building event beginning 1.2 billion years ago in the Proterozoic, which obscured older rocks. Throughout the Proterozoic and Paleozoic, Virginia experienced igneous intrusions, carbonate and sandstone deposition, and a series of other mountain building events which defined the terrain of the inland parts of the state. The closing of the Iapetus Ocean, to form the supercontinent Pangaea added additional small landmasses, some of which are now hidden beneath thick Atlantic Coastal Plain sediments. The region subsequently experienced the rifting open of the Atlantic Ocean in the Mesozoic, the development of the Coastal Plain, isolated volcanism and a series of marine transgressions that flooded much of the area. Virginia has extensive coal, deposits of oil and natural gas, as well as deposits of other minerals and metals, including vermiculite, kyanite and uranium. Stratigraphy, Tectonics & Geologic History In the Proterozoic, the Blue Ridge region formed between the Roanoke River and Potomac River during the Grenville orogeny 1.2 to one billion years ago. The metamorphism of pre- existing rock obscured evidence of the earlier geology of the region. Geologists believe that older pre-Grenville rocks were granulite gneiss, interbedded with volcanic and sedimentary rocks, dating back to 1.8 billion years ago. Igneous charnockite, with large amounts of blue quartz, rocks also formed during the Grenville event. The unusual crystallization suggests that the rocks formed in a low-water crustal environment. In Roseland, between Charlottesville and Lynchburg, is a nine mile long intrusion of the 90 percent plagioclase feldspar rock anorthosite, the formation of which remains poorly understood by geologists. The Roseland area was a major source of titanium for many years. For 500 million years until the beginning of the Phanerozoic terrestrial erosion wore down the Grenville rocks. Igneous activity resumed in the Eocambrian 600 million years ago. Magma ascended through the crust, but stopped due to a high-density zone and through a process of fractional crystallization, cooled to form basalt. Overlying rocks melted to form granitic magma and erupted as rhyolite on the northern end of the Blue Ridge, intruding overlying granulite and charnockite. The Robertson River granite, with a 70 mile long outcrop is a remnant of this felsic melting. To the west of the Blue Ridge, the Chilhowee Group sandstones formed thick sequences, recording a beach environment in Iapetus Ocean. Paleozoic For 100 million years in the Cambrian and Ordovician, eastern North America was covered in a shallow tropical sea. In parallel with the proliferation of multi-cellular life, large carbonate deposits, including sequences of limestone and dolomite formed, together with sandstone deposits. The closing of the Iapetus Ocean attached the Inner Piedmont belt and the Smith River allochthon to the Virginia Piedmont. Sediments shed during the Taconic orogeny covered the new terranes, as the trough filled during the Silurian. The Tuscarora and Massanutten sandstones formed as a massive shoal during this period. Geologically recent erosion of Paleozoic carbonates forms the many gorges in the Valley and Ridge province, as well as caves. During the late Silurian into the early Devonian, the region was relatively quiet for 40 million years, with little activity besides the deposition of some carbonate banks. However, the Iapetus Ocean was still closing, adding additional small terranes to the region, including one which is likely concealed by Coastal Plain sediments. Mountains, uplifted during the Acadian orogeny shed clays, which formed shale deposits during the Devonian in the trough. In the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian periods of the Carboniferous, large tropical swamps formed in the west and were periodically buried with clay, to form coal deposits. By the time of the Alleghanian orogeny 320 million years ago, the Iapetus Ocean was completely sealed. Tectonic forces formed the Massanutten synclinorium and other small synclines and anticlines in the Valley and Ridge province. A thrust fault, forced the rocks of the Blue Ridge on top of the Shenandoah Valley. As a result, rock formations from the Cambrian through the Silurian are stacked twice in the Shenandoah Valley. Sandstones remained intact, but some shales were metamorphosed to phyllite during the Alleghanian orogeny. Veins filled with quartz, calcite and pyrite. Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago) In the early Mesozoic, the rifting apart of the supercontinent Pangaea to form the Atlantic Ocean, created large rift basins, which filled with sediments‚Äîultimately forming the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The oldest basins in Virginia date to the Triassic and Jurassic. The Cretaceous rocks of the Potomac Group cover these older sedimentary rocks. The Potomac Group is subdivided into the Patapsco Formation and Patuxent Formation, which comprise gravel conglomerate, sandstones and sandy clay that often outcrops along rivers. In the Jurassic, volcanic activity in Blue Ridge formed isolated volanos, as well as dikes and sills in the Valley and Ridge province. Examples include Mole Hill, to the west of Harrisonburg, and Trimble Knob in Monterey. Natural Chimneys Regional Park preserves a thin basalt sill, near the base of pinnacles of limestone. Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present) In the Paleocene period of the Cenozoic, high sea levels from the Cretaceous dropped, bringing an increase in terrestrial erosion. The sedimentary rocks of the Pamunkey Group formed during a marine transgression in the Eocene. The component Aquia and Nanjemoy formations contains sand, clay, small gypsum crystals, green glauconite grains as well as fossils. Sea levels dropped again during the Oligocene, only to return to widespread inundation during the Miocene and Pliocene, depositing the two cycles of the Chesapeake Group. The Calvert, Choptank and Saint Marys formation are the lower group, deposited in the Miocene, while the Eastover and Yorktown formations deposited from the late Miocene into the Pliocene. The two phases of deposition are marked by sand, clay and coquina. Cornwallis Cave is eroded into the cross-bedded coquinas of the Yorktown formation, along with the sea cliffs at Westmoreland State Park (which also exposes underlying Eastover and Choptank rocks). During the 1.8 million years of the Pleistocene, sea levels rose and fell six times, dropping 400 feet during the last glacial maximum. The Chesapeake Bay was not present for the first half of the Pleistocene due to low sea levels. The Windsor and Charles City formations formed along an open coastline during this time. The surficial Shirley formation, beneath what is now Newport News and Hampton, deposited during the Middle Pleistocene, reaching the York and James river estuaries. The Tabb formation, formed during the late Pleistocene. Estaury, beach and swamp deposits have become much more numerous in the last 11,000 years of the Holocene. Hydrogeology Virginia has only two natural lakes: Lake Drummond and Mountain Lake. The origin of both lakes is unclear. Due to unconsolidated sediments, Lake Drummond should have eroded very quickly. Some geologists have proposed that it may have formed from a meteorite impact. Mountain Lake appears to be a natural dam, formed by the Clinch sandstone, which impounded a mountain stream. The state has nine major river basins. Natural resource geology In colonial times and earlier periods of American history, Virginia had active mining for lead, zinc, gold, and titanium. However, metal mining had ceased by the late 20th century. Danville, Virginia hosts the largest deposits of uranium ore in North America, but uranium mining is prohibited by Virginia state law. In 1986, 850 different mines produced 40 million tons of coal, valued at $1.5 billion, in 1985 US dollars. Oil and gas are produced in the western Valley and Ridge province. At the same time, 250 to 300 quarries were producing limestone, granite, slate, soapstone and gravel. Willis Mountain, near US 15 between US 60 and US 460 hosts the largest kyanite mine in the world, supplying the automotive spark plug and high-temperature kiln industry. Virginia also has significant vermiculite production.

The church is dedicated to St. Nicholas. History The building of the St. Nicholas Church in Paƒçetin started in 1752 and the construction works were finished in three years period so that it was blessed in 1755 by the Bishops of Pakrac Sofronije Jovanoviƒá. At that time, three Orthodox priests practiced religious services in the village. The church was reconstructed several times in its history with 1908 reconstruction being the first one, 1958 the second and 1986 the third reconstruction with the renovation work still in progress in 2018. The new church iconostasis was erected in 1910 and it was the work of painter Ivan Ti≈°ov. Iconostasis was commissioned by the Government of Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, nominally autonomous kingdom within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with the aim to create higher quality in the standards of equipment of sacral edifices for both the Orthodox and the Catholic churches within the kingdom. Architecture The architectural framework for the iconostasis is designed in the Byzantine Revival architecture style which was the most frequently used style in the late 19th and early 20th century design of Orthodox churches in Croatia while most of the design elements are based on the classical origin. The compositional structure of iconostasis and the style of painting are in line with the Western academic traditions of painting. Some icons show the elements of Secession with the icon of the Virgin's on the top of the iconostasis having the most elements of Secession. Old iconostasis from the 1891 was painted by ƒêorƒëe Rakiƒá from Ne≈°tina. During the World War II, the Church of St. Nicholas was turned into Roman Catholic church by the authorities of the Independent State of Croatia. Ustashas damaged the iconostasis and parish house and robbed part of the church inventory. During the Croatian War of Independence in 1991 church was hit with two shells that damaged its altar section. In the early 2000s church attracted attention among Orthodox and some Catholic believers when story about weeping icon of Saint Nicholas appeared in regional and national media.

In 1940 she got married and moved to Reno, Nevada, turning her back on research to devote herself to political and social work. Between 1961 and 1975 she wrote the column The Polls, which appeared regularly in the Public Opinion Quarterly.

Access in July 03, 2016.https://www.nytimes.com/1975/07/12/archives/hazel-erskine.html Scientific career Hazel Gaudet was an early member of the Princeton Radio Project at Princeton University, before moving to Columbia University to work at the Bureau of Applied Social Research. There, the social and communication scientist was mainly responsible for administration and data analysis. She also recruited and trained young interviewers and conducted some interviews herself. As a member of the Princeton Radio Project, she was also instrumental in co-authoring The Office of Radio's first two studies: The Invasion from Mars (1940) and The People's Choice (1944). Following this work, she worked as an analyst in the Surveying Division of the Office of War Information (OWI) in New York and London, where she led some research into the effectiveness of war propaganda.Eleanor Singer, Herbert H. Hyman, George Rudiak, Ralph L. Dentin, Elmer R. Rusco, Richard L. Siegel, John M. Aberasturi: In Memoriam: Hazel Erskine 1908‚Äì1975. In: The Public Opinion Quarterly. 39, Nr. 4, 1975, S. 571‚Äì579. In addition, she worked in the research department of the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and assisted Charles Wright Mills in his studies on the role of union leaders, which was published in 1948 under the name The New Man of Power. The Invasion from Mars The 1940 study The Invasion from Mars is dedicated to the study of reactions after the performance of the 1938 radio drama The War of the Worlds. In communication science, this study is considered one of the key works of media impact research. Four people initially played an important role in the project: Paul Lazarsfeld, Hadley Cantril, Herta Herzog and Hazel Gaudet. While Lazarsfeld and Cantril negotiated with the leaders of the Rockefeller Foundation for research funding, Herzog and Gaudet were responsible for organizing and analyzing the results. Herzog conducted a series of interviews with the radio play listeners. Gaudet was responsible for administrating the research project and the statistical analysis of the entire data. Although the two women apparently made the largest contribution to the study, Hadley Cantril is still called the main author of the work, whereas Gaudet and Herzog are usually mentioned only briefly as employees. The study interviewed 135 people. Subsequently, 100 respondents who had reacted in panic were selected. The aim of the study was to explain the reasons for the partly panic reactions to The War of the Worlds radio play. In analyzing the results, the listeners could be classified into 4 different types: # Listeners who tested the inner evidence of the radio play. # Listeners who checked the program with other information and learned that it was a radio play. # Listeners who tried to check the program with other information, but for various reasons still believed that the program was an authentic newscast. # Listeners who made no attempt to check the broadcast or the events. For one, a lot of those who panicked believed what they heard without questioning it. On the other hand, the authors saw the reason for the panic in the fact that some switched on too late, thereby ignoring the announcement that it was a Halloween joke. Furthermore, the three scientists analyzed which characteristics of the reception situation and which personal characteristics of the listener led to increased anxiety potential. They found that the lack of ability to think critically and question the information was critical to their response. However, according to the study, critical thinking could be overridden by a high degree of suggestibility and emotional insecurity. Journalistic work Gaudet-Erskine's experience with public opinion benefited her in 1961, when she was given the task of restoring The Polls' regular column in the Public Opinion Quarterly. Before the scientist took over the column, The Polls consisted mainly of a list of survey results on a variety of topics without further analysis, interpretations or historical context. Gaudet-Erskine chose a contemporary theme for each issue and prepared it with survey data, analysis and opinion trends. Above all, she dealt with controversial issues of the time: civil rights, women's roles in society, freedom of expression, religion and social assistance programs, etc. Political activism With her move to Reno, Nevada Gaudet-Erskine became more politically and socially engaged. One of her first politically motivated actions was to get support for the ADC (Aid to Dependent Children) program. At the time, Nevada was the only state that did not participate in the government-sponsored program. In 1955, the legislature finally voted for Nevada to join. At the same time, Gaudet-Erskine was increasingly advocating better social services for old and blind people and transferring responsibility for social assistance from individual counties to the state level. In the years 1952 and 1956 she has an active role in Adlai Stevenson's two presidential campaigns. Two years later she worked for the later governor of Nevada Grant Sawyer. In this context, Gaudet-Erskine traveled to Nevada's all 17 counties to get the necessary support for Sawyer. Gaudet-Erskine took over the organization, planning and analysis of Sawyer's campaigns. In the course of this activity, she was able to benefit from her academic career as a pollster and the techniques learned there. As an associate and advisor to Governor Grant Sawyer, she helped him use women and minority representatives in political positions. She was also a member of the social committee of the state of Nevada. In 1966, she organized the first meetings of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Nevada in her own living room until the organization became established. In 1970, she was elected Nevada's representative on ACLU's national board. In addition, she occupied important positions in the Biennial Conference Committees between 1992 and 1994 and the Nominating Committee 1975. Homages Since 2015 the American Political Science Association gives the Hazel Gaudet Erskine Political Psychology Career Achievement Award, honoring remarkable people in the field of political psychology.

Born with Poland syndrome, she is missing three fingers on her right hand and has an underdeveloped pinky and thumb. At age 5, she was fitted with a 3D-printed robotic hand by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, College of Engineering. She came to national prominence in 2017 when she expressed a desire to use her robotic hand to throw out the ceremonial first pitch in all 30 Major League Baseball parks. She completed her goal on September 16, 2018, with an appearance at Angel Stadium. She has also been honored with dropping the puck at a 2018 Vegas Golden Knights‚ÄìPhiladelphia Flyers hockey game. Biography Hailey Dawson was born in Henderson, Nevada, on March 2, 2010. Her father, Greg, is a corrections officer for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, and her mother, Yong, is a photographer. She has an older brother, Zach. Hailey was born with Poland syndrome, believed to have stemmed from a lack of blood supply at six to seven gestational weeks. She is missing a right pectoral muscle and three fingers on her right hand; the pinky and thumb on her right hand are also underdeveloped. Her left hand is fully functional. Robotic hand The University of Nevada, Las Vegas, College of Engineering built a robotic hand for Dawson in response to a request from her mother, Yong. With the cost of regular prosthetics exceeding $20,000, and the foreseeable need for Hailey to require new prosthetics as she grows, Yong sought a less expensive solution. She found open-source designs for a 3D-printed prosthetic posted online by a South African organization called RoboHand, and asked the UNLV College of Engineering to produce one for her daughter. The college agreed to take on both the project and the development costs. After experimenting with several RoboHand designs, the college ended up designing their own robotic hand from scratch and printing it on their in- house 3D printer. While many students in the department worked on the project in its early stages, graduate student Maria Gerardi eventually became the chief designer of Dawson's robotic hand. As Dawson grows, Gerardi modifies the hand using computer software. Dawson will likely need a new hand every year. The robotic hand is constructed from ABS plastic with rubber joints held together with a type of fishing wire. It includes about 30 parts. The hand does not operate on electronics, but on wrist movement: when Dawson flexes her wrist, the fingers grip; when she extends her wrist, the fingers uncurl. In 2017 Gerardi added an adjustable thumb and fingertip ridges to help Dawson grip items better. The hand is secured to her wrist with Velcro straps. Per Hailey's request, the hand is fitted with an arm covering so she can collect autographs of players at the stadiums she visits. Each robotic hand takes about one week to make and costs $200 in components. Dawson's mother can easily \\"adjust tension screws or reattach fingers to joints\\" using a set of tools. Dawson uses the hand to grip and throw baseballs. She throws the ball underhand. Ceremonial first pitches first pitch to Manny Machado at Oriole Park, August 2015 Dawson made her first ceremonial first pitch at a UNLV Rebels baseball game in 2015 shortly after receiving her first 3D-printed robotic hand at age 5. She then expressed a desire to throw out the first pitch at a Baltimore Orioles game, as her father, a Maryland native, had made the team a family favorite. She appeared at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in August 2015. Dawson next posted a request on Instagram to meet Bryce Harper, a fellow Las Vegas native, and in June 2017 threw out the first pitch to him at Nationals Park. In 2017 Dawson expressed a wish to throw out the first pitch at all 30 Major League Baseball stadiums. A September 2017 video report of her quest posted on Twitter by Bleacher Report went viral. In response, many Major League teams extended invitations to her. Major League Baseball also invited her to throw out the first pitch at Game 4 of the 2017 World Series at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas. Dawson began her \\"Journey to 30\\" quest to pitch in the remaining 27 stadiums during the 2018 Major League Baseball season with an appearance at Petco Park, home of the San Diego Padres, in late March. On September 16, she reached her goal with an appearance at Angel Stadium, making her the first person to throw out the ceremonial first pitch in all 30 Major League Baseball stadiums. United Airlines flew her and family members to each stadium at no cost. For each stadium Dawson pitched at, the UNLV College of Engineering produced a 3D-printed robotic hand customized with the home team's logo and colors. For Dawson's appearance in Game 4 of the 2017 World Series at Minute Maid Park, Gerardi printed and hand-painted two models of the hand featuring the series' gold and blue logo. After reaching her goal of throwing out the first pitch in all 30 MLB stadiums, Dawson donated her Baltimore Orioles-themed robotic hand, which was signed by 13 members of the team and staff, to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

Reception Lidz-Ama Appiah of CNN wrote that \\"the film is a powerful illustration of the impact of chronic starvation.\\" Kirk Honeycutt of the Associated Press criticized the film's lack of background information about and discussion with its subjects, writing that \\"the film simply shows the families getting through the day without any concern for filling the audience in on their pasts, their relationships or what they think about their dire conditions. Padilha says he chose this approach to provoke empathy about hunger. But empathy requires understanding of people, not simply observing or pitying them. You don't, in fact, understand these people.

He was a child prodigy, raised on a sugar cane plantation, and a direct descendant of John Papa  ªƒ™ ªƒ´, personal attendant to Lunalilo. Trained as an opera singer, he vocalized in both tenor and baritone ranges. He and actor James Shigeta briefly toured as a nightclub act. Versatile with a variety of vocal forms, and a multi-linguist, he sang the music of Cole Porter at the Hollywood Bowl, and presented a concert in honor of Kamehameha Day at Carnegie Hall. Davis performed with the Opera Company of Boston during a White House engagement, and was a nightclub performer in Hawaii. He received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Hawai'i Academy of Recording Arts, and was inducted into the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame . Background Davis was born in 1925 in Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii, of mixed heritage that included Native Hawaiian. His father, Arthur Lewis Davis, was the resident physician on Waialua Sugar Plantation, where he and his brother Francis were raised. His mother, Rose Kaouinuiokalani Davis, was the daughter of Irene  ªƒ™ ªƒ´, whose father John Papa  ªƒ™ ªƒ´ was a personal attendant and political advisor to Hawaiian royalty. Territorial legislator Francis Hyde I'i Brown was his uncle. His mother tutored him in the Hawaiian language. Music was ever-present in their home. Rose Davis was known for hosting expansive luaus that drew hundreds of guests, among whom were that era's popular Hawaiian entertainers. He would later reminisce about his youth when his father's patients would pay visits during the Christmas season and fill their home with singing. He attributed much of his later repertoire to a songbook once owned by Queen Lili ªuokalani musical prot√©g√©e Rose Tribe. Robert Cazimero described Davis' personal character as, \\"Charlie's from that time when people were kinder, gentler ‚Äì who believed in the aloha spirit and shared everything with everyone.\\"; Davis was a child prodigy, playing the piano at age 2, and later learning the cello and pipe organ. After serving in the Seventh Air Force during World War II, Davis enrolled in the University of Hawaii as a music major, becoming a member of the Gleemen of Honolulu under the university's music director Norman Rian. Initially developing his talent as a baritone, he was selected to receive vocal training during the summer of 1948 at the Music Academy of the West at Santa Barbara, California, under the mentorship of veteran operatic baritone Richard Bonelli. Before leaving for California, he made a June 7 appearance on radio station KGMB 15-minute weekly show The Musical Voice of Young Hawaii. Following completion of his training in California, Davis enrolled at the Juilliard School In New York. Career success Davis was a 1951 winner of Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts. That year, he and James Shigeta teamed as a nightclub act under the names of Charles Durand (Davis) and Guy Brion (Shigeta), appearing at the Mocambo in Los Angeles, the Flamingo Las Vegas and the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago. Although successful, the act was short-lived due to Shigeta's enlisting in the United States Marine Corps.; Davis switched his vocal range to tenor, and in 1953 made his debut performance at the Hollywood Bowl, as part of an evening of the music of Cole Porter. In between tours, Davis resumed voice training in New York. In 1958, he became one of the finalists in the Metropolitan Opera Auditions of the Air. As a result, the Met's General Manager Rudolf Bing offered him a tour of Europe, but a prior commitment at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel in Waikiki precluded his acceptance, and Bing's offer was dropped. The Waikiki engagement resulted in his first record album, Ray Kinney Presents Charles K. L. Davis At The Royal Hawaiian.; The following year, Davis joined television host Ed Sullivan ensemble for two weeks at Gorky Park in Russia. In 1961, he teamed with the Honolulu Symphony Orchestra for a 3-performance run as Lieutenant B.F. Pinkerton in Madame Butterfly. He appeared as Don Ottavio opposite Cesare Siepi and Leontyne Price in the NBC Opera Theatre television production of Don Giovanni. As part of an ensemble at a 1967 White House concert given in honor of Turkish president Cevdet Sunay, Davis sang the role of protagonist Prince Caprice in the Opera Company of Boston presentation of the Jacques Offenbach operetta Voyage to the Moon. In his global travels, he expanded his repertoire by learning songs in the languages of countries he visited. His 1968 debut at Carnegie Hall was held on June 11 in honor of Kamehameha Day, and was a showcase of his multilingual musical style. Later life His father died in 1965. Davis returned home permanently in 1968 to care for his mother. Honolulu Mayor Neal Blaisdell declared January 19, 1968 as \\"Charles K.L. Davis Day in Honolulu\\". His mother died in 1972. Davis moved away from opera performances and began to entertain in local clubs, such as the Waikiki venues of the Rhumba Line and the Halekulani, as well as numerous appearances on the Hawaii Calls radio broadcasts.; At the Kemoo Farms restaurant in Wahiawa, Davis maintained a 13-year twice-weekly performance schedule during the buffet luncheons. His brother Francis died in 1989. In the remaining years of his life, Davis suffered from diabetes, frequently requiring hospitalization.

The Prairie School is found in the house's horizontal orientation, the lowpitched hip roof, broad eaves, paired windows, the two brick belt courses, and the solarium on the south elevation. The Craftsman influences are found in the French doors, built-in cabinets, and paneling on the interior. Bricks from the house that was destroyed as well as the broad window in the first floor study, its fireplace mantel, and the kitchen windows were reused in this house.

The station is approximately 1 km from the town center. It has official status as an object of Russian cultural heritage.  History  The Tsarkoe Selo station was opened on 22 May 1838 with the construction of the first in Russian Empire Tsarskoye Selo Railway from Saint-Petersburg to Pavlovsk.Pushkin, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica on-line–ü—É—à–∫–∏–Ω (–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥ –≤ –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–±–ª.), Great Soviet Encyclopedia on-line (in Russian) Construction began in May 1836, and the first test trips were carried out the same year between Tsarskoye Selo and Pavlovsk, using horse-drawn trains. The first station building was built according to the project of Italian architect Gaspare Fossati. The building was designed in the English Gothic style. It was a two- story brick building with a quadrangular tower and two side one-storey wooden phases. Awnings were installed to the side phases, leaning on cast-iron pillars and wrought-iron curly arms. In 1902-1904 on the site of the old building was built a new project by a group of architects under the leadership of S. A. Brzhozovsky. Symmetrical building was designed in the late eclecticism characteristic for Western Europe. To the left of the station there was the Grand Princely Pavilion. Both buildings were destroyed during the Second world war. Tsarskoye Selo station was renamed to Detskoye Selo after the Great October revolution. The third station building was built from 1946 to 1950 by the project of the Leningrad architect Evgeny Levinson and engineer Andrey Grushke. Their project was honored the Stalin Prize. The station complex includes the main two-story building and three pavilions. In the pavilions there are descents in tunnels under railway tracks. The general composition is designed in strict classical forms, which are typical for Pushkin's architecture. The design of the facades and interiors reflects the connection of the city with biography and creation of Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. The facade of the main building is decorated with medallions and bas- relief portraits of teachers and friends of the poet such as Gavriil Derzhavin, Nikolai Karamzin, Vasiliy Zhukovsky, Anton Delvig, Pyotor Chaadayev, Wilhelm K√ºchelbecker. A bronze sculpture of Alexander Pushkin by the sculptor Matvey Manizer was installed in the waiting room, divided by two rows of columns A plafond of the hall is decorated with panels depicting the constructions of the Tsarskoye Selo parks. The booking hall is decorated with paintings in the form of trees with widely spaced branches. On the walls are placed bas-reliefs with a profile portrait of Alexander Pushkin. Overdoors and iron chandeliers, white matte and blue glass complement the decoration of the hall. In USSR times, from 1932 to mid 1960s, a dedicated railroad line existed between Detskoe Selo station and Kolpino railway station in neighboring industrial Kolpino city. Line had one stop in the middle, and its main purpose was transportation of workers to Kolpino's Izhorskiye Zavody industrial complex. The line was temporarily dismantled during Great Patriotic War. Tsarskoye Selo station was electrified DC and equipped with automatic train protection in 1953. On 6 August 2013, the original name, Tsarskoye Selo, was returned.

On August 2, 1944, soldiers of the Waffen-SS - SS-Pz. Gren. Ausb.-und Ers. Btl. 3 (of SS-Panzer Division \\"Totenkopf\\") shot about 600 Poles on the premises of the prison at 37 Rakowiecka Street. It was one of the biggest crimes committed by the Germans in Mokot√≥w during the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising. During the massacre, some prisoners actively resisted the Nazis, which allowed several hundred people to escape to the area controlled by the insurgents.  Before the outbreak of the Uprising  Soon after the Germans entered Warsaw (28 September 1939), the former Polish penitentiary at 37 Rakowiecka Street was adapted for the needs of the occupying forces. The Gerichtsgef√§ngnis in der Rakowieckastrasse 37 was henceforth a prison under the authority of the German special courts (Sondergericht), and its residents remained in the hands of the Gestapo after serving their sentence. In addition to prisoners subordinate to special courts, officers of the Polish Army, who did not fulfil the obligation to register with the German authorities, economic criminals and Germans convicted of criminal offences, were also detained at Rakowiecka StreetRegina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak ‚Äì wiƒôzienie Gestapo.

Many Polish employees of the prison secretly cooperated with the underground Service for Poland's Victory - later with the Home Army.

In the summer of 1944, the prison was under the authority of Commissioner Hitzinger. On July 23, 1944, in connection with the approaching Eastern Front, the release of prisoners sentenced to imprisonment for up to five years began - mainly Germans and Volksdeutsche, and later Poles. Within five days, 655 people were released, including about 300 PolesWiƒôzienie Mokotowskie. geotekst.pl.. However, as a result of bribery of prison authorities, Hitzinger ordered that the release of the detainees be haltedSzymon Datner, Kazimierz Leszczy≈Ñski (red.): Zbrodnie okupanta w czasie powstania warszawskiego w 1944 roku (w dokumentach). Warszawa: wydawnictwo MON, 1962. p. 128. On August 1st, one hour before the uprising broke out, 11 more prisoners were released. According to the records kept by the deputy head of the prison, court inspector Kirchner, at the time of the outbreak of the uprising there were 794 more prisoners in the prison at 37 Rakowiecka Street, including 41 minorsMaja Motyl, Stanis≈Çaw Rutkowski: Powstanie Warszawskie ‚Äì rejestr miejsc i fakt√≥w zbrodni.

On August 1, 1944, insurgents from the IV Region of the Home Army (V District \\"Mokot√≥w\\") attacked German positions on the whole length of the Rakowiecka street, attacking SS barracks at 4 Rakowiecka Street (SS-Stauferkaserne), airmen's barracks at the entrance of Pu≈Çawska Street (Flakkaserne), the SGGW building and batteries of anti-aircraft artillery placed in the Mokotow Field. The task of conquering the prison and the neighbouring tenement houses was entrusted to the First Assault Company, commanded by Lieutenant Antoni Figura \\"Cat\\" from the \\"Baszta\\" Regiment. This unit consisted of about 80 soldiers (including nurses) and its armament was very modest - 3 machine guns, 20 rifles, 15 pistols, 130 grenades and 30 bottles with \\"Molotov cocktails\\"Les≈Çaw M. Bartelski: Mokot√≥w 1944. Warszawa: wydawnictwo MON, 1986. . p. 188. Home Army soldiers managed to enter the prison and occupy the administrative building, but it proved impossible to reach the penitentiary buildings. During the battle lieutenant \\"Cat\\" suffered a serious wound. The German crew, reinforced from the nearby SS barracks, stopped the attack, disarmed and captured Polish guards. According to a report by the deputy head of the prison Kirchner, the attack cost the Germans 9 killed and 17 woundedLes≈Çaw M. Bartelski: Mokot√≥w 1944. Warszawa: wydawnictwo MON, 1986. . p. 189. Despite the shelling from tank guns, the insurgents kept the captured administrative building until dawn of August 2. During the day, however, they were forced to retreat.

Massacre  On August 2nd, Kirchner was appointed Acting Head of the Mokotow Prison. At 11.00 a.m. he was called to the nearby SS barracks. There, SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer Martin Patz, the commander of subunit of the 3rd SS Battalion of Armored Grenadiers (SS-Pz. Gren. Ausb.- und Ers. Btl. 3), declared to him that General Reiner Stahel, the commander of the Warsaw garrison, ordered the extermination of the prisoners. This decision was also confirmed by the SS and Police commander for the Warsaw district, SS-Oberf√ºhrer Paul Otto Geibel, who additionally ordered the execution of Polish guards. Kirchner drew up a takeover report, on the basis of which he placed at Patz's disposal all the prisoners in the prisonLes≈Çaw M. Bartelski: Mokot√≥w 1944. Warszawa: wydawnictwo MON, 1986. . p. 277. The SS soldier entered the prison in the afternoon. They wrote down the exact status of all the cells, and then from the two investigative wards on the ground floor they took out about 60 men, who were ordered to dig three ditches, about 25-30 meters long, and about 2 meters wide and deep[4][10]. The first ditch was dug along the walls of pavilion X on the laundry side, the second one in the walking square on the side of Niepodleg≈Ço≈õci Avenue, and the third one in the walking square on the side of Kazimierzowska Street. German soldiers were drinking vodka during the digging. After the work was finished, all the diggers were shot. The Germans then proceeded to eliminate the remaining prisoners. The pensioners were taken out of their cells, led over excavated pits and murdered with a shot in the back of their heads. The first to be executed were prisoners from wards 1 and 2 (the so-called investigative wards), among them several boys aged from 12 to 14. Then the patients of the Chamber of the Sick were murdered. Later, the SS began to empty wards: 8 (recidivists), 10 (prisoners with high sentences), 11, 3, and 5 one by oneLudno≈õƒá cywilna w powstaniu warszawskim. T. I. Cz. 2: Pamiƒôtniki, relacje, zeznania.

The bullet passed behind my ear [I heard the swish] and I fell face to face with the corpses. I heard shots of executions and the killing of the injured when someone moved. At one point, unable to bear the burden of corpses, I decided to stand up and end my life. I was sure that the SS men would shoot me as soon as I got up. I looked up and saw that there was no one above me.

Warszawa: wydawnictwo MON, 1962. p. 129.  Prisoners' revolt  The slaughter, which took place in the prison courtyard, was perfectly visible from the windows of the cells, and the Poles who watched it realized that they were condemned to death and had nothing to lose. Prisoners from wards 6 and 7 on the second floor decided to take a desperate step and attacked the perpetrators. In ward 6, prisoners broke the cell door or made holes in the walls using benches, and then they escaped to the corridor and set fire to the straw and mattresses, thus scaring off the Germans. In ward 7, the prisoners managed to kill several SS men and take away their weapons. Then the whole second floor was barricaded and the prisoners from the cells of ward no. 9 (minors) were released. Surprised Germans withdrewLes≈Çaw M. Bartelski: Mokot√≥w 1944. Warszawa: wydawnictwo MON, 1986. . p. 278-279. At night, under the cover of darkness and heavy rain, the prisoners began to move to the attic and then to the steep roof of the building. From there, they descended onto the wall surrounding the prison, where civilians came to their aid, carrying ladders. In this way, from 200 to 300 prisoners managed to escape and get to the area occupied by the insurgents. The Germans did not try to stop them, because they wrongly hoped that the prisoners would run away through the main gate. The fate of detained Polish guards is unknown. Some witnesses testified that the guards were not murdered together with the prisoners and that many of them survived the warSzymon Datner, Kazimierz Leszczy≈Ñski (red.): Zbrodnie okupanta w czasie powstania warszawskiego w 1944 roku (w dokumentach).

Epilogue  From April 16-21, 1945, exhumation works were carried out on the premises of the Mokot√≥w prison. At that time, about 700 bodies from the period of the Warsaw Uprising were found, some of which were buried in the prison only after the prisoners had been murdered (usually the bodies of Poles imprisoned and murdered in a makeshift prison in Stauferkaserne barracks). The found bodies, with the exception of those taken care of by the families, were buried temporarily in eight mass graves in Niepodleg≈Ço≈õci Avenue. In December 1945 all bodies were again exhumed and transferred to the Military Cemetery in Powazki, where they were buried in the insurgent quarters. In 1978, the trial of SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer Martin Patz, known as the \\"butcher of Mokot√≥w\\", began before a Cologne court. He was judged for the crimes committed by his SS-men during the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising, including, above all, the murders of prisoners in the prison at Rakowiecka Street. In February 1980 Patz was convicted and sentenced to 9 years in prison. Karl Misling, who was tried in the same trial, was sentenced to 4 years in prisonFriedo Sachser. Central Europe.

It was originally described to science by James E. Benedict in 1902. This and other species of squat lobsters are sometimes referred to as \\"pinch bugs\\".  Description  alt= Munida quadrispina is brick red on its upper, dorsal side, and lighter colored underneath on its ventral side. The claws, chelipeds, are exceptionally long. There are small spines on the chelipeds. There are three pair of thin walking legs. The tail, telson, and large uropods on either side of the tail create a large tail fan. These animals can swim backwards rapidly by flexing their tail fan. The eyes are pigmented. The carapace of this animal may be up to 6.7 cm (2.6\\") long, but the chellipeds may be several times longer.  Habitat  This squat lobster is found in Eastern Pacific waters from Sitka, Alaska to the Coronado Islands, Baja California, including Puget Sound. It is found in water depths from 12 to 1463 meters. These animals favor rocky bottoms and rock faces in areas of low current. The low current often results in a silty habitat. There is evidence that this species can tolerate low oxygen concentrations.  Life history  These crabs forage on the bottom, eating detritus, carrion, plankton, and benthic shrimp. They hide from predators in rock crevices and under cobbles. Their long claws allow them to feed from the safety of these recesses. They are found on deep water sponges in British Columbia. Unlike most other species of squat lobsters, Munida quadrispina juveniles are pelagic, swimming freely in the sea, foraging on plankton, before they mature and settle to the bottom.  Edibility  There are commercial fisheries for several species of squat lobster, and even an experiment serving them at Long John Silver's, but there is no commercial fishery for Munida quadrispina. This species is not listed in the Food and Drug Administration's Seafood List. They are, however, occasionally caught in recreational prawn traps and adventurous chefs have prepared them as they might other crabs. They are reported good to eat.

The action of Sniper Fury takes place in the near future. Technological development and geopolitical changes rendered former methods of resolving conflicts obsolete. Countries, corporations, and organizations employ services of highly trained professionals, who can eliminate specific targets with surgical precision. Gameplay The game revolves around mechanics common for most sniper games, where the player has to eliminate a great majority of his targets from long distance. To complete a task, the player can use a variety of futuristic gadgets, e.g. a detection device that will tell the location of every nearby human, or stimulants, which will boost reflexes to supernatural levels. Release Sniper Fury was released on 2 December 2015 for Android, iOS and Windows Phone. The Steam version was released on 13 June 2017.  Reception  Sniper Fury received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic.

This species is endemic to New Zealand. It is a colourful day flying moth that lives in mountainous habitat. Taxonomy This species was described by Edward Meyrick in 1888 using material collected at Mount Arthur at an altitude of approximately 1200m in January and named Arcteuthes chrysopeda. Meyrick misspelt the genus, the correct spelling of which is Arctesthes. George Hudson discussed and illustrated this species under the name Lythria chrysopeda in both his 1898 book New Zealand moths and butterflies (Macro-lepidoptera) and his 1928 publication The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand. Robin C. Craw placed this species within the genus Notoreas in 1986. The lectotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. Description Meyrick described the species as follows: Distribution This species is endemic to New Zealand. It is found in the Mount Arthur tableland. Biology and behaviour This species is on the wing in January and February. It is a day flying moth, most active in bright sunshine. Habitat and host species N. chrysopeda prefers open tussock clearings in mountainous forest habitat. Larvae of New Zealand moths within the genus Notoreas feed exclusively on plants within the genera Pimelea and Kelleria.

Colonial period  The colonial government was not interested in balanced economic growth. Instead, it concentrated its development efforts on irrigated agriculture and the railroad system throughout the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium (1899‚Äì1955). Incidental government investment went mainly into ad hoc projects, such as the construction of cotton gins and oilseed-pressing mills, as adjuncts of the irrigation program. A limited amount of rain-fed mechanized farming was also initiated during World War II. After the war, two development programs‚Äîactually lists of proposed investments‚Äîwere drawn up for the periods 1946‚Äì50 and 1951‚Äì55. These plans appear to have been a belated effort to broaden the country's economic base in preparation for eventual Sudanese independence. Both programs were seriously hampered by a lack of experienced personnel and materials and had little real impact. Independently, the private sector expanded irrigated agriculture, and some small manufacturing operations were started, but only three larger industrial enterprises (a meat-processing plant, a cement plant, and a brewery) were constructed, all between 1949 and 1952. The newly independent Sudan‚Äôs principal development inheritance in 1956 thus was the vast irrigated Gezira Scheme and Sudan Railways.  Postcolonial period  The new government did not attempt to prepare a national development plan until 1960. A Ten-Year Plan of Economic and Social Development for the fiscal years (FY) 1961‚Äì70 was drawn up for SDP565 million, at the time equivalent to more than US$1.6 billion. The private sector was expected to provide 40 percent of the amount. Unfortunately, the government had few experienced planners, and goals were overly ambitious. The plan as prepared was not adhered to. Implementation was by investment programs that were drawn up annually, and projects not in the original plan were frequently included. Investment was at a high rate in the first years, so that a number of major undertakings were completed by midplan, including the Khashm al-Qirbah and Manaqil irrigation projects and the Roseires Dam. As the 1960s progressed, a lack of funds threatened the continuation of development activities. Government current expenditure had increased much faster than receipts, in part because of the intensification of the civil war in the South. At the same time, there was a shortfall in foreign investment capital. The substantial foreign reserves held at the beginning of the plan period were depleted, and the government resorted to deficit financing and foreign borrowing. By 1967, the Ten-Year Plan had been abandoned. Late in the 1960s, the government prepared a new plan covering FY 1968 to FY 1972. That plan was discarded after the military coup led by Colonel Ja‚Äôfar al-Numayri (in power, 1969‚Äì85) in May 1969. Instead, the government adopted the Five-Year Plan of Economic and Social Development (1970‚Äì74). That plan, which was prepared with the assistance of Soviet planning personnel, emphasized socialist development. After the end of the first civil war in the South, in 1973 the government established the Interim Action Program, which extended the original plan period through FY 1976. New objectives included the removal of transportation bottlenecks, attainment of self-sufficiency in the production of several agricultural and industrial consumer items, and an increase in agricultural exports. Investment during the first five years was considerably above the original plan projection; however, the plan failed to achieve its goal of a 7.6 percent annual growth rate of gross domestic product, so it was extended to 1977. During the years of the Interim Action Program, the government initiated several irrigation projects, established factories on the Nile northeast of Khartoum and on the White Nile south of Khartoum, paved the roads between Khartoum and Port Sudan, and began excavation in the South for the Jonglei Canal, also seen as Junqali Canal. In early 1977, the government published the Six-Year Plan of Economic and Social Development, 1977‚Äì82. The plan goals and projections also appeared optimistic because of the worsening domestic economic situation, marked by growing inflation. The inflation stemmed in large part from deficit development financing (printing money), increasing development costs because of worldwide price rises, and rising costs for external capital. During the plan's second year, FY 1978, there was no economic growth, external debt pressures increased, and Sudan failed to meet its scheduled payments. The result was an abandonment of Six-Year Plan projections, a restriction of expenditures generally to the completion of projects under way, elimination of transport constraints, and a series of short-term ‚Äúrolling‚Äù programs that emphasized exports. In October 1983, the government announced a three-year public investment program, but efforts to Islamize the economy in 1984 impeded its implementation. Between 1978 and 1985, agricultural and industrial production declined in per-capita terms, and imports during much of the 1980s were three times the level of exports. After the al-Numayri government was overthrown in April 1985, the investment program was suspended. An economic recovery program began in August 1987. This program was followed, beginning in October 1988, by a three-year recovery program to reform trade policy and regulate the exchange rate, reduce subsidies and the budget deficit, and encourage exports and privatization. The military government of Colonel Umar al-Bashir that took office on June 30, 1989, offered little possibility for early economic recovery. Foreign business interests viewed the government‚Äôs policies to Islamize the banking system as a disincentive to do business in Sudan because no interest would be paid on new loans. Finally, the government did not satisfy the IMF or other major creditors that it had reduced subsidies on basic commodities enough to reduce its budget deficit. By 1991 the value of the Sudanese pound against the U.S. dollar had sunk to less than 10 percent of its 1978 value, and the country‚Äôs external debt had risen to US$13 billion, the interest on which could be paid only by raising new loans. Two reasons for the decline in production were the droughts and accompanying famine occurring in 1980‚Äì91, and the influx of more than 1 million refugees from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Chad, and Uganda, in addition to the persons displaced by the warfare in the South, which had resumed in 1983, who were estimated to number between 1.5 million and 3.5 million. Nevertheless, the decline in Sudan's agricultural and industrial production had begun before these calamities. Few development projects were completed on time, and those that were completed failed to achieve projected production. Sudan found itself in a cycle of increasing debt and declining production. Sudan borrowed heavily for its development programs over the years; then it suffered severely as international interest rates increased. During the 1990s, Sudan's relationship with the IMF became increasingly strained as a result of continuing debt arrears dating back to 1984. In 1997, when the IMF threatened to expel Sudan from the fund, the government revised its economic policies and established a comprehensive economic reform and structural adjustment program with the assistance of the IMF. The program, which continued, sought to stabilize the macroeconomic environment, reduce the rate of inflation, strengthen the external accounts, increase growth through privatization and deregulation, reform the banking sector, liberalize trade, and revise investment and foreign-exchange controls. Although some aspects of the program, including privatization, have been disappointing, the IMF has praised the government for its adherence to the reform agenda. The IMF lifted its ‚Äúnon-cooperation‚Äù order in 1999 and restored Sudan's voting rights in 2000. The reform program has been credited with significant improvements in the economy. Inflation fell from triple digits to hover around 10 percent, the currency stabilized, foreign investment rose, and there were several years of economic growth. Nevertheless, there were still many problems to overcome, especially the impact of the previous civil war and the conflict in Darfur, which continued to place a heavy burden on government finances and undermine investor confidence, and the external debt arrears, which hindered access to new foreign funding.

Biography Shepherd was born in New South Wales, the son of freed-convict parents James Shepherd (a horse thief) and Ann Thorn (transported for stealing silver spoons). As a cadet at the Church Mission Society's Samuel Marsden, Shepherd was present when Marsden celebrated Christmas at the Bay of Islands in 1814. This celebration was the first known Christian service in New Zealand.Wises New Zealand Guide, 7th Edition, 1979. p.367 Subsequently, Shepherd and his wife Harriet left Sydney and settle in New Zealand permanently in 1821, as Marsden selected him in NSW for his farming skills and his wife's nursing talents.Proceedings of the Society of Architectural Historians, Australia and New Zealand Vol. 31 Shepherd and his family settled first in 1820 on the land of Ngapuhi chief Te Morenga of Tai-a- mai, near Waimate North, then moved to church service at Keri Keri in 1833. There, he was asked to take charge of the existing store until the new building was completed, planting the gardens at Kemp House. Religious mission Shepherd assisted Samuel Marsden's missions at Oihi and Te Puna near Kerikeri and Henry Williams' mission at Paihia. These first C.M.S. missionaries in New Zealand (William Hall, John King, Thomas Kendall, Francis Hall, John Butler, James Kemp and James Shepherd) met criticisms stating: \\"they did not convert one single Maori; their survival is attributed to Maoris' tolerance rather than missionary proselytizing\\". Contributions to MƒÅori language As Shepherd was fluent in Maori, he wrote in Maori an account of the 'Creation, Fall and Recovery of man', then a translation of St. John's Gospel. Later, as a member of a team including Gilbert William Puckey, William Yate and William Williams, he contributed to the drafting of the first Maori language version of the Bible.The Conversion of the Maori: Years of Religious and Social Change, 1814‚Äì1842 This was the first time Te Reo was put into written form. A printed copy of Shepherd's translation of the ‚ÄúBook of Ruth‚Äù is currently displayed at Te Papa, Museum of New Zealand.  Settlement  In 1836, Shepherd purchased a block of land at Tauranga, Whangaroa from James Kemp Tupe, From 1838, he settled permanently at his home named 'Waitangi' near the St James Anglican Church, Matangirau.

He also contributed to writing the video game franchise Devil May Cry, its television anime series, as well as two light novels based on it. Career Morihashi published his first series named Tokyo Shimatsumou which was divided in two volumes. During the making of the second volume, Morihashi was hired by Capcom to get assistance with the video game Devil May Cry 2. Due to being one of the newest members from the team, Morihashi did minor works such as overseeing the translation and instruction manual among others. Nevertheless, he found working in the video game was too stressing due to the major overhaul it had once director Hideaki Itsuno took over completion of the title. Shortly after the release of Devil May Cry 2, Itsuno decided the staff should develop a new video game, Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening. Morihashi was once again employed but this time took a bigger role during game development. As he had not experienced doing planning, he was given the role of writing the scenario. The game's main character, Dante, was given a different characterization than in the first Devil May Cry due to his original creator, Hideki Kamiya, not being involved within the project. While feeling his own take on the character did not equal the popularity of the original one, Morihashi enjoyed Dante's role in the game. Besides Dante, Morihashi felt challenging the making of Vergil due to how he had no prior design yet he still had to come up with an entire new one for the artists. Unlike Devil May Cry 2, the latest game was a commercial and critical success which led Itsuno to start a project for another title from the series, Devil May Cry 4. Morihashi found problems with the making of this game because he felt the writers did not collaborate well together to the point Morihashi stated he had problems having contact with any of them. Once finishing the scenario, Morihashi quit Capcom. However, requests for help from Itsuno resulted in Morihashi returning to company for one year. Morihashi created the new main character, Nero, alongside other Capcom members in order to give the gamers an appealing character considering Dante achieved high popularity in the previous games. After leaving Capcom, Morihashi teamed up with Yasui Kentarou to write the novels Devil May Cry 4: Deadly Fortune. Divided in two volumes, the novels were published in 2009. In the afterword, Bingo wrote that these removed scenes were intended to be included in the game, but were not due to some production reasons.

On 24 March, his dead body was found. Police investigation ruled the death as an accident, but Dragiƒçeviƒá's parents claimed that their son was brutally murdered and that the police and prosecutor's office are trying to cover-up the case. The result of the police investigation provoked major public uproar, and many mass protests were organized demanding the truth and justice. The public was overwhelmingly convinced that Dragiƒçeviƒá was murdered. In May 2018, the National Assembly of Republika Srpska voted to form an Inquiry Board to analyze circumstances surrounding Dragiƒçeviƒá's death. The Board found that Dragiƒçeviƒá was probably murdered, but its report was rejected by the Assembly. , the Prosecutor's office has not reacted, and the death remains classified as an accident, while the public protests are ongoing. The incident On 18 March 2018, 21-year-old David Dragiƒçeviƒá went out with his friends around 7 p.m., but never returned home and was declared missing the same day. On 24 March, his dead body was found small Crkvena creek in suburb of Banja Luka. Dragiƒçeviƒá was buried on 7 April at the New Cemetery of Banja Luka. The funeral was attended by the President of Republika Srpska Milorad Dodik. Police investigation Police investigators claim that on 18 March, Dragiƒçeviƒá visited the cafe in central Banja Luka where he had been caught up in a fight with several other young men. After this incident, nothing was heard from him until 24 March when police were informed about a dead body found in the water. According to the police, Dragiƒçeviƒá visited another cafe after the fight, left, and then robbed a house on the way home. Police inspector Darko Iliƒá claims that surveillance cameras confirm that Dragiƒçeviƒá committed the robbery on the way home and that several stolen items from the robbed house were found in his pockets. According to the police investigation, after the robbery, on his way home, Dragiƒçeviƒá walked across a small bridge over Crkvena creek and fell in the water and drowned. Coroner ≈Ωeljko Karan said that Dragiƒçeviƒá had several haematomas on his body, probably caused by strokes during the fight he had, and also several post-mortem injuries on the hands, caused by stones at the bottom of the creek. When journalists asked Karan about the possibility that the haematomas were caused by another attack on the bridge, he answered that it is indeed possible, but that it \\"could not be determined during the autopsy\\". Despite this, police officially ruled the death as an \\"accident\\". Dragiƒçeviƒá family and public response Memorial place for David Dragiƒçeviƒá in center of Banja Luka From the start of the investigation, Dragiƒçeviƒá's parents claimed that their son was brutally murdered and that they possess evidence of that. According to Davor Dragiƒçeviƒá, David's father, the killer is a well-known figure, and police officers, Minister of the Interior Dragan Lukaƒç, and local police chief Darko ƒÜulum, are trying to cover-up the crime. Dragiƒçeviƒá's mother said that he, on the night he disappeared, sent her an SMS that read \\"if anything happens to me, the perpetrator will be F. ƒÜ.\\" Dragiƒçeviƒá's death triggered daily protests in Banja Luka from the day his body was found. Every evening at 6 p.m., a crowd of 200 has been gathering at the Krajina Square in central Banja Luka demanding justice for Dragiƒçeviƒá. On 15 May, a large protest was organized in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where several hundred people demanded justice for Dragiƒçeviƒá and D≈æenan Memiƒá, a young man from Sarajevo whose 2016 death was also ruled an accident, but whose father and friends claim he was murdered. On 16 May, similar protest organized in Zenica was attended by several hundred people. On 20 May, another protest was held in Tuzla under the banner \\"Justice for David and D≈æenan\\". Another protest was organized in Sarajevo on 26 May. Another large protest was organized in Banja Luka on 7 July and attended by 10.000 people. On October 5th another massive protest was organized in Banja Luka with over 40.000 attendees (30.000 people more than in previous gatherings) in this huge event.

Chairman of the parliamentary caucus of the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) Vukota Govedarica said on 10 May that he thinks Dragiƒçeviƒá was murdered. Parliamentary Inquiry Board Under constant public pressure, on 11 May 2018, the National Assembly of Republika Srpska voted to form an Inquiry Board to analyze circumstances surrounding Dragiƒçeviƒá's death. On 5 June, the Inquiry Board adopted a 320-pages long report after hearing members of the police and public prosecutor's office, coroner Karan, and minister Lukaƒç. The report concluded that there is more than enough evidence that Dragiƒçeviƒá was murdered and that the public prosecutor should immediately respond to those findings. On 3 July, the National Assembly rejected the Inquiry Board report by a majority vote. The report was supported by the opposition MPs, but rejected by the majority coalition of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD), the Democratic People's Alliance (DNS), the Socialist Party (SP) and two independent MPs. The Assembly majority held that the Board did not have competency to characterize the case as a murder. Instead, they suggested the following conclusion: \\"The National Assembly expects the Prosecution and other law-enforcement agencies to treat the case of David Dragiƒçeviƒá in accordance with their legally prescribes competencies and to act in accordance with the regulations of the Criminal Procedure Code, which will oblige other institutions to act accordingly.\\" Although not accepting the report, the Assembly adopted conclusion that \\"the prosecutors in the case made numerous errors\\" and demanded that \\"the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina consider initiation of certain disciplinary procedures against the prosecutors\\".

Silvester is a Republican politician, businessman, and white collar criminal from Connecticut. Personal life and education Paul Silvester is the son of George and Eva Silvester of Hartford, Connecticut. Silvester was married to West Hartford lawyer Christine A. Olson but the couple divorced in 2002 while he was on trial, they have two children together. Public service career In 1997 Silvester was appointed as the Connecticut State Treasurer by Governor John G. Rowland when incumbent Treasurer Christopher Burnham retired. At the time Silvester was the youngest State Treasurer in the country. He left office in 1999 after losing his seat in an election to the Democratic nominee Denise Nappier in 1998. Investigation Soon after he retired the FBI and SEC began investigating him and his close associates while in office. Silvester's campaign was referred by the United States Attorney to the State Elections Enforcement Commission for fundraising irregularities. The commission found that during Silvester's 1998 campaign a number of individuals connected to the campaign and Silvester had made illegal contributions to Paul Silvester for State Treasurer. The commission assessed multiple civil penalties against those responsible as well as requiring parties to enter into a consent agreement. A scheme was discovered by incoming Treasurer Denise Nappier. Nappier alleged that Silvester had moved so much of the State Retirement and Trust Fund into high-risk, long term, non-liquid private equity funds that it unbalanced the State's investment plan, increasing the risk of a long term failure. Silvester was accused of diverting State Pension and Trust Fund business to specific investment firms in return for kickbacks. These kickbacks came in a number of forms, but primarily took the form of no-work consulting and lobbying contracts provided to Silvester and close associates. The scheme was alleged to have netted $2.25 million in false fees and kickbacks. Sentenced Silvester pled guilty and was sentenced to 51 months in prison, he had faced up to 40 years but the sentence was especially lenient because Silvester agreed to cooperate in taking down a wider network of racketeers and corrupt government officials.

It has up to three bluish green flowers with reddish brown lines and a labellum with a purplish \\"beard\\". The plant is leafless when flowering. It is only known from a small area near Cardwell. Description Calochilus psednus is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single dark green, grooved leaf long and wide. The leaf is not present during flowering. Up to three bluish green flowers with reddish brown lines, long and wide are borne on a thin, wiry flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is about long and wide and the lateral sepals are about long and wide. The petals are about long and wide. The labellum is flat, long and about wide and shiny reddish brown. The most of the labellum has well-spaced, short purple hairs apart from the last quarter which is hairless. The flowers appear from December to February but only last a few hours. Taxonomy and naming Calochilus psednus was first formally described in 1989 by David Jones and Bill Lavarack and the description was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society of Queensland from specimens collected south of Cardwell. The specific epithet (psednus) is derived from the Ancient Greek word psednos meaning \\"thin\\", \\"scanty\\" or \\"bald\\". Distribution and habitat The Cardwell beard orchid grows in broad-leafed paperbark woodland with dense shrubs and sedges and is only known from near the type location. Conservation Calochilus psednus is classed as \\"endangered under the Nature Conservation Act 1992 and the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.

Inspired by the Japanese tradition of Ukiyo-e, his prints were linear in character, finely detailed, but with imagery traced in a web of thin, coiled and looping lines, creating a woodcut that was often mistaken for an etching. Ragle‚Äôs persistent attempt of capturing his own features in his woodcuts was triggered by a diagnosis of Crohn‚Äôs disease in the early 1970s, a chronic illness that would mark his life and his art. The medications so affected and altered his features that his prints became a way of preserving and rescuing a sense of identity. As Kenneth Baker noted in Roy Ragle's obituary: \\"Mr. Ragle (...) had long depicted death as his companion in woodcuts and prints in other media, in a manner reminiscent of European dance of death imagery and to Mexican folk art tradition.\\" Kenneth Baker, Roy Ward Ragle. Widely Exhibited Master of Woodcut. San Francisco Chronicle, January 21, 2015  Early life and education  Roy Ragle was born in National City in Southern California in 1944. He received his B.A. from San Diego State University in 1968 and his M.F.A. from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1974. He taught relief printmaking at San Francisco State University from 1976 until 1979, the year when his illness became severe.  Career  Upon seeing the first exhibit of self-portrait woodcuts at the Jehu/Wong Gallery in San Francisco 1981, Thomas Albright notes in the San Francisco Chronicle: \\"His features themselves undergo alterations, as do their expressions: frequently stoical, occasionally agonized. But Ragle never concedes to the rhetoric of tragedy; expressionism is kept in a precise balance with a coolly aloof, almost clinical self-scrutiny.\\" Thomas Albright. An Artist‚Äôs Compelling, Somberly Tragic Power. San Francisco Chronicle, November 3, 1981 Started in January 1973, at the beginning of his MFA program, the series of woodcuts called Self-Portrait would persist till 1981, resulting in 54 large woodcuts printed in an edition of 10 each, several of which being oversize. His most monumental statement in woodcut stands as the culmination of this series. It is entitled ‚ÄúSelf-Examination Series Part II,‚Äù a triptych in which Ragle‚Äôs self-portrait is flanked by that of Carol, his wife and Susan Dunn, his therapist who later would also die of Crohn's disease. The work measures 108‚Äù by 48‚Äù and the three blocks began as a body print: with their thrift shop clothes inked up, each of them was lowered with ropes onto the wood, and this inked impression was then carved and added to by Ragle in extreme detail using a dental dremel. The densely worked surface of the triptych, with the arduous process of creating the ridges of wood to simulate the lines, was a task that took him from 1987 to 1990. Art Hazelwood. Curator‚Äôs Statement for the exhibition: In Extremis: Prints Monumental, Intimate and Encompassing. Meridian Gallery, San Francisco. 2011 It was Roy Ragle‚Äôs last great statement in woodcut, a declaration of triumph in the face of illness and this in an exacting technique. Due to the demands of his approach to the medium and due to his poor health, Roy Ragle moved on and explored more experimental approaches to printmaking. On the occasion of a retrospective of Ragle‚Äôs work in 2000, Karin Breuer describes the transition as follows: \\"Roy developed a form of monotype using relief matrices made from aluminum foil. It was a successful substitute for woodcut that enabled him to continue working on his autobiographical self-portrait subjects. The foil monotype relief prints have evolved into a kind of body art as Roy creates a mold of his face using the foil which is then distorted when inked and flattened during printing.\\" Karin Breuer, Curator-in-Charge, Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. In a brochure to the exhibition: Roy Ragle. Crossing the River Styx, Woodcuts and Monoprints, Fetterly Gallery, Vallejo, CA. 2000 These later works employing the foil are hybrid and unique works that defy easy classification. The surfaces are complex, densely layered and overworked with pen and ink. The often grim nature of the imagery is held in check with the complex treatment of the surfaces. The foil masks pressed against the faces of himself, of family and friends, bear little resemblance to the final monoprints, the matrix often trampled underfoot. As Herlinde Spahr notes: \\"These steps lead to a print in which the matrix is crushed in the act of creation and the image, the portrait itself, must share in that fate. These unique prints compress in their surface a number of printmaking steps, each successive layer doubling the distance between the original mask and its final copy.\\" And yet, as in the foil monoprint of Crossing the River Styx‚Äôs Series, Portrait of Margie Cotner Potts, the trampled and deformed mask can become a shimmering, gentle presence. Herlinde Spahr, Of Pressure and Printmaking. California Printmaker, October 2000, p. 19.  Legacy  Roy Ragle died on December 11, 2014, three days after turning 70. His work had been shown in prominent San Francisco galleries: the John Berggruen Gallery, the Don Soker Gallery, the Meridian Gallery. He had major exhibitions at the Legion of Honor Museum in San Francisco, and at the Triton Museum of Art in Santa Clara. Roy Ragle was a longtime member of the California Society of Printmakers of which he was made an honorary member in 2005.Kenneth Baker, Roy Ward Ragle. Widely Exhibited Master of Woodcut.

It was built from 1876 to 1877. It is also known as the Deniliquin Uniting Church. The property is owned by the Uniting Church in Australia. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  St Andrew's Uniting Church was constructed as the St Andrew's Presbyterian Church in 1876-77 and opened on 2 December 1877. Sabbath Hall was constructed in 1896. Following the unification of the Presbyterian, Methodist and Congregationalist Churches, the Uniting Church decided to retain the St Andrew's site and sell the Methodist Church on the opposite corner to the Salvation Army.  Conservation  One option considered by the church as part of the consolidation of its properties was the demolition of the existing St Andrew's Church and Hall. A member of the congregation requested protection of the buildings. Due to its uncertain future a Section 130 order was made over the Church and Hall on 25 March 1983. On 8 April 1983 the Uniting Church gave notice of its intention to demolish the Church and parts of the Hall. Subsequently, an Interim Heritage Order was placed over the site on 27 May 1983. On 13 July 1983 members of the Heritage Council during a tour of the region met with the Minister and Parish Council to discuss the matter. However, no immediate solution was reached. The Heritage Council considered the matter at its meeting of 27 November 1984. Views of the Uniting Church Board of Finance and Property were sought who advised that a change in the shift of attitudes could occur. It was considered that alternate design solutions on the site may be possible that allowed additional buildings whilst retaining the Church and Hall. As a result, another Interim Heritage Order was made. A report by Hardcastle and Richards P/L Structural Engineers made it clear that due to structural problems it would be not feasible to retain the Sabbath Hall building. On 19 June 1984 a small dilapidated addition to Sabbath Hall was approved for demolition. At its meeting of 10 November 1986 the Heritage Council recommended that it was not possible to keep Sabbath Hall and that in the light of the withdrawal of Parish objections to proceed with the making of a permanent Conservation Order. This was gazetted on 13 February 1987. In 1989 a small grant of up to $2,000 was made to the Parish on a $ for $ basis for conservation works and advice to the Church, with the works completed in the same year. Sabbath Hall was demolished in 1990.  Description  St Andrew's Uniting Church is a finely detailed building constructed of the red brick characteristic of the Deniliquin area. Designed in the Victorian Free Gothic style, the Church is flanked by a series of buttresses and a tower dominates its front elevation. The steep pitch of the slate roof is reflected in the multitude of pinnacles which combine with small flying buttresses and some Romanesque elements to decorate the tower. This theme is repeated in the entrance porch centrally located at the front of the Church. St Andrew's Sabbath Hall (now demolished) was also constructed of Deniliquin brick, is rectangular in form with a pitched roof of corrugated iron. Its principle facade contained several elements of Greek revival architecture. Of symmetrical design, its windows and doors had lintels with classical consoles. Pilasters in the form of columns supported an entablature with a decorative pediment.  Heritage listing  St Andrew's Uniting Church is centrally located on a prominent site within the urban area of Deniliquin. The Church was constructed in 1876-77, is designed in the Free Gothic Style, is carefully designed and built and has a quite powerful presence considering its size and the nature of the site. The building is of historical and architectural significance to Deniliquin and the surrounding region. It is in relatively original intact condition. The Church is regarded as one of the finest buildings in Deniliquin and is of particular architectural merit.Branch Managers Report 28 April 1983 St Andrew's Uniting Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

The first phase of this transit route entered service on September 1, 2019, and was originally free for the first month; the free service was extended to the second and third months due to problems with the fare collection system. The Red Line links Broad Ripple to the University of Indianapolis via Downtown Indianapolis. Local service continues beyond these endpoints with every other bus continuing on to the respective county lines at either end of Marion County as Route 90.  History  Fountain Square in July 2019. On May 31, 2018, the Indianapolis Public Transportation Corporation (IndyGo) began construction of the Red Line, the city's first Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) line. The first phase of the system opened on September 1, 2019, after about 15 months of construction and testing. The $96.3 million project included a $75 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration. Two additional BRT lines (Purple Line and Blue Line) are presently planned, along with extensions on both ends of the Red Line. The Red Line has been assigned IndyGo Route #90. Phase 2 will extend the line farther north, with approved phase 2A running from the end of phase 1 at 66th Street and College Avenue north to the county line at 96th Street. A yet- to-be approved phase 2B extension from there into Hamilton County would travel through suburban Carmel to Westfield, terminating the line in that city's Grand Park. Phase 3 will run from just north of Hanna Avenue on Shelby Street at the University station to Greenwood. Approved phase 3A will take the line to County Line Road South, and a yet-to-be approved phase 3B would continue south into Johnson County to a terminus near Madison Avenue and Smith Valley Road in Greenwood. At introduction, every second BRT vehicle continues along the future route of the Red Line beyond the completed BRT stations as \\"Route 90 - Red Line Local\\", stopping at traditional bus stops along the remainder of both ends of the route in the county. The Red Line will be effectively be split into two separate, but co-branded routes. The first will run from 96th and College to Shelby and Campus (University station), while the second will run from the Greenwood Park Mall to 66th/College station. Wireless charging sites have been installed at 96th Street & College Avenue and at the Greenwood Park Mall Park & Ride stop on County Line Road South to facilitate recharging of the buses as necessary. This is in addition to the recharging facilities previously announced at the 66th/College station and at the IndyGo Maintenance Facility on West Harding Street. Only BRT vehicles will use the stations, with the exception of six of those along Meridian Street and one on 38th Street. Route 39: East 38th Street buses will also share those seven station facilities, in anticipation of that route being eventually replaced by the proposed Purple Line BRT service. Due to traffic issues and low ridership, IndyGo discontinued the 96th and College stop on the Red Line Local extension on December 20th. Since then, Route 90 has terminated at College Avenue and Lake Nora Drive, just south of 91st Street. Station listing There are at present 28 stations on the Red Line. All stations are served by all Red Line vehicles, but every other bus continues on beyond the last station to the county line as Route 90 - Red Line Local. Those that do not continue on to execute the turnaround procedure from the station as detailed in the Red Line operations manual. { class= - !Station !Type !Opened !Notes - 66th/College Curbside (NB only) September 1, 2019 North terminus of Phase 1; wireless vehicle charging site; NB vehicles terminating use protected signal at 66th Street to make U-turn to SB College via Old College Avenue - Broad Ripple (Broad Ripple/College) Center Island September 1, 2019 south of Broad Ripple Avenue - Kessler/College Center Island September 1, 2019 south of Kessler Boulevard East Drive - 54th/College Center Island September 1, 2019 at Bungalow Court, north of 54th Street - 52nd/College Center Island September 1, 2019 mid-block, south of 54th Street - 46th/College Center Island September 1, 2019 south of 46th Street - 42nd/College Center Island September 1, 2019 north of 42nd Street - Park/38th Median Station September 1, 2019 at Park Avenue; Purple Line will share - 38th/Meridian Center Island September 1, 2019 south of 38th Street; Purple Line will share - 34th/Meridian Center Island September 1, 2019 north of 34th Street; Purple Line will share - 30th/Museum (30th/Meridian) Center Island September 1, 2019 north of 30th Street; Purple Line will share - Fall Creek/Ivy Tech (Fall Creek/Meridian) Center Island September 1, 2019 north of Fall Creek Parkway, North Drive; Purple Line will share - 22nd/Meridian Center Island September 1, 2019 south of 22nd Street; Purple Line will share - 18th/Meridian Center Island September 1, 2019 north of 18th Street; Purple Line will share - IU Health Methodist Hospital (18th/Capitol) Center Island September 1, 2019 south of 18th Street - 14th/Capitol Center Island September 1, 2019 north of 14th Street - 9th/Capitol Center Island September 1, 2019 south of 9th Street at Arch Street - Vermont/Capitol Center Island September 1, 2019 north of Vermont Street - Statehouse (Washington/Capitol) Center Island September 1, 2019 south of Court Street, north of Washington Street - Julia M.

History  In 1857 a school site was chosen close to the Edward River and in 1861 a brick schoolhouse was erected with a frontage to George Street. A survey revealed that only 138 children out of the 613 living in the area attended school. In 1879 a new school building was built on the site and for one year the old 1861 school became the schoolmaster's residence. As the building was in bad repair, the school principal, David Kennedy refused to live there and in 1880 the old building was demolished a new schoolmaster's residence was constructed in Gothic Revival style. In 1899 the school was enlarged and in 1905 another room was added. Two more classrooms and a science room were added in 1928. The school closed in 1972 and was taken over by the Deniliquin Municipal Council, to be used a museum and arts centre managed by a Museum Trust and the George Street Historical Society.

Greene's architecture practice was based in Kentucky, Oklahoma and Texas. His built projects are known for an original interpretation of organic design.  Biography  Herb Greene, Snyder, Oklahoma, 1961. Photo by Robert Alan BowlbyPrairie House designed by Herb Greene. Photo: Robert Alan BowlbyGreene left Syracuse University in New York in 1948 to enroll at the University of Oklahoma, where he studied under the direction of Bruce Goff (1904‚Äì82), a modernist architect known for his iconoclastic design philosophy. While earning his degree and after, Greene worked for Goff, preparing architectural drawings, which are now included in The Art Institute of Chicago, Archival Collection. During 1951-1954 Greene worked for John Lautner in Los Angeles, California and then relocated to Houston, Texas, where he worked for Joseph Krakower and established his own practice. In 1957 Greene returned to the University of Oklahoma, where he and his colleagues, Bruce Goff (1904‚Äì82) and Mendel Glickman (1895-1967), among other faculty, developed the American School of architecture, a curriculum that emphasized individual creativity, organic forms, and experimentation. Donald MacDonald, an architect who trained under Greene and Glickman, described the American School as ‚Äúa truly American ethic, which is being formulated without the usual influence of the European or Asian architectural forms and methodologies common on the East and West coasts of the United States.‚Äù Students were taught to look to sources beyond the accepted canon of western architecture and to find inspiration in everyday objects, the natural landscape, and non-western cultures such as the designs of Native American tribes of Oklahoma and the Western plains. Greene realized the completion of his building, The Prairie House in 1961, a structure that pre-dated the green building movement by a decade. Located in Norman, Oklahoma, this modernist residence, integrates concepts that are now associated with smart architecture: natural materials, passive design, natural lighting and ventilation, energy efficiency, and careful site placement. Julius Shulman(1910-2009) photographs of The Prairie House were featured in Life and Look magazines, in addition to several international publications. This media exposure brought Greene recognition for his experimental architecture and counter-culture design philosophy. In 1964 Greene left Oklahoma to become a professor of architecture at the University of Kentucky, where he taught for 18 years and designed buildings that reflected client- centered regional architecture. Greene believed that dialogue between the architect and client was paramount to creating a design that both could support. He subscribed to the philosophy that ultimately the users and clients needed to make buildings their own. He did this through the integration of regional and historical references and by incorporating the client's personal objects into a meaningful relationship with the actual design such as in the Joyce Residence. Greene has lived in Berkeley, CA, since 1982, where he continues to explore the interdisciplinary realm of architecture, art, science and philosophy. He is a published author, on the subject of visual perception and neurobiological systems. Greene‚Äôs work as an artist, architect and writer explores symbolic relationships between memory, experience, object and environment.  Legacy  Prairie House, 1961 designed by Herb Greene. Photo: Robert Alan BowlbyHerb Greene carried forward the American School legacy in his projects throughout the Great Plains area and Kentucky, focusing on contextual relationships to site and climate with an experimental and resourceful consideration of materials. Like his mentors, Greene strives for an individual solution to problem solving, stressing the particular over the general, however his fascination with the role of architectural symbols as a means of expanding individual expression, is an approach that is unique to his personal architecture practice. Greene‚Äôs work is known for original concepts, organic design characteristics and connections to landscape. His architectural drawings are in The Art Institute of Chicago‚Äôs archival collection alongside work by Louis Sullivan (1856-1924), Frank Lloyd Wright (1867-1959), Bruce Goff (1904-82) and others associated with the ‚ÄúPrairie Tradition‚Äù.

Art practice and influences  Detail of Prairie House exterior. Photo by Robert Alan BowlbyUnitarian Church in Lexington. Designed by Herb Greene, 1965. Photo: Robert Alan BowlbyGreene's visual art practice spans six decades. His work investigates ways in which an event is represented in the mind and how associative meaning evolves into other states of perception. Central to this concept, which Greene derived from Alfred North Whitehead, is the notion that objects are not static entities and have multiple aspects that are apparent by various cues that can be measured against our own biological constructs that form emotional and intellectual experiences. Greene's other influences include the philosophical views of Gertrude Stein (1874-1946), George Lakoff (1941) and Mark Johnson (1949). His paintings are in private collections across the United States and in the permanent collection of The Art Institute of Chicago. In 1962 the Oklahoma City Art Museum presented the first exhibition of Greene's paintings. Later exhibitions include the Illinois Biennial, 1965, Krannert Art Museum, IL; Fine Arts Gallery, 1966, University of Arkansas, AK; Kovler Gallery, 1966, Chicago IL; Phoenix Gallery, 1970, NY; University of Kentucky, Fine Arts Gallery, 1974, KY; Living Arts and Science Center, 1975, KY; and The Louisville Arts Association, 1976, KY.

Peeris was the owner and managing director of the Uva Bus Company, a major transport company in Uva Province, as well as the Gardia Motor Service Company Limited and the Trading and Forwarding Agency Limited. On 11 March 1944 Peeris was elected to the State Council at a by- election for the seat of Bibile, however the unsuccessful candidate, Wijeyananda Dahanayake, petitioned the courts against the election results with the court overturning the result and awarding the seat to Dahanayake. At the 2nd parliamentary election, held between 24 May 1952 and 30 May 1952, Peeris ran as the United National Party candidate in the Badulla electorate. He secured the position of second member, polling 12,047 votes (30% of the total vote), which was only 403 votes ahead of J. C. T. Kotelawala, who had been elected as the second member at the 1947 elections. In March 1954 Peeris was appointed as the inaugural president of the Uva Young Men‚Äôs Buddhist Association. In 1956 Peeris was awarded an OBE in the 1956 New Year Honours for his parliamentary service representing the Badulla electorate.Ceylon list: He retained his parliamentary seat, as the second member of Badulla, at the 3rd parliamentary election, held between 5 April 1956 and 10 April 1956, receiving 14,724 votes (33% of the total vote) 6,184 votes behind Kotelawala. On 1 January 1958 the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna coalition government nationalised all private bus companies, including the Uva Bus Company. At the 4th parliamentary election, held on 19 March 1960, the Badulla electorate was changed to a single-member constituency. As a result Peeris switched to the newly created Passara electorate, again running as the United National Party candidate. He was successful winning by a narrow margin of only 70 votes over the Sri Lanka Freedom Party candidate, Amarananda Ratnayake. However, as neither of the major political parties managed to obtain a sufficient majority in the election a new election was called. At the July elections for the fifth Parliament which followed four months later, Peeris failed to retain the Passara seat, losing to Ratnayake by 602 votes. Peeris contested Passara at the 6th parliamentary election, held on 22 March 1965, winning back the seat from Ratnayake, 6,022 votes to 5,694, a margin of 328 votes. He subsequently served as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Commerce and Trade in the Third Dudley Senanayake cabinet.

Araceli Striano writes: \\"This fact highlighted something which scholars had already suspected: koine did not suddenly replace the local dialects nor did those dialects disappear abruptly.

It was signed in Salisbury, Rowan County, in the royal Province of North Carolina on August 8, 1774 in response to a series of punitive laws passed by the British Parliament in 1774, the Intolerable Acts, after the political protest against Tea Act in Boston, the Colony of Massachusetts Bay, commonly known as Boston Tea Party. Rowan County was the first county in North Carolina to adopt such resolutions in the early stages of American Revolution. Discovery The document was discovered in Iredell County in 1851 among the papers of the Sharpe family which were direct descendants of William Sharpe, the last Secretary of the Rowan County Committee of Safety. The document was first published to the general public by Colonel Wheeler. Authenticity of the document was asserted by a committee of experts before the publication. Summary The freeholders of Rowan County opened the document with the assertion of their fidelity and obedience to King George III and his right to the Crown of Great Britain and Dominions in America. Then the authors proceeded to state their position on the recent Royal measures in response to the economic and political events in the colonies. * The right to impose taxes on the colonists lies within the jurisdiction of the General Assembly of the province (as opposed to the legislature in England) * Imposition of taxes by any authority other than the General Assembly is an infringement upon the constitutional rights and liberties of the colonies. * Opposition to taxation without representation in response to the tea tax imposed on the colonies by the British Parliament. Comparison of taxation without representation to the state of slavery. * Regarding the cruel treatment of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay as the intent to deprive colonies of their rights and liberties. * Proclamation of the cause of the Town of Boston as the common cause of the colonies and calling \\" firmly to unite in an indissoluble Union and Association\\" to oppose the infringement upon the rights and privileges in the colonies. * A call not to import British goods into the colonies and banish luxury and extravagance as well as encourage local manufacturing by subscription. * Objection to African slave trade on the grounds that it prevents manufacturers and other useful immigrants from settling in the colonies. * Encouragement of raising sheep, hemp, and flax. * Assertion that wearing clothes manufactured in the colonies is a sign of true patriotism. * Appointment of Samuel Young, Moses Winslow, and William Kennon to represent Rowan County at the First Provincial Congress in anticipation of the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia. * Recommendation not to trade with any colony that will refuse to join the Union to preserve rights and liberties in the colonies as will be agreed upon in the future Continental Progress in Philadelphia. Signatories Freeholder representatives from all parts of Rowan County signed the Resolves. * James McCay * Andrew Neal * George Cathy * Alexander Dobbins * Francis McKorkle * Matthew Locke * Maxwell Chambers * Henry Harmon * Abraham Dinton * William Davidson * Samuel Young * John Brevard * William Kennon, Efq., Chairman * George Henry Barringer * Robert Bell * John Bickerftaff * John Cowdon * John Lewis Beard * John Nifbet * Charles McDowel * Robert Blackburn * Chriftopher Beekman * William Sharpe * John Johnfon * Morgan Bryan * Adlai Osborne, Efq., Clerk Commemoration On August 9, 2009 Rowan Public Library held the first annual Rowan Resolves Day to commemorate Rowan County's involvement in paving the road to American Independence.

In early 2018 the Trump administration designated the group as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist Organization under an executive order. A Washington DC based think tank called The Washington Institute for Near East Policy asserted that the group's formation could be a bid by Iran to replace Hamas as a proxy with Sabireen given Hamas' stance on Syria and the religious divide between the two. In 2019, Hamas arrested 70 Sabireen members and confiscated their weapons, effectively ending the existence of the organisation. The reasoning behind such move was that Hamas wanted to maintain peace with Israel, while Sabireen Movement refused any attempts at reconciliations. https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/03/gaza- hamas-bans-sabireen-movement-shiite-iran.html Ideology Upon creation, the movement did not introduced itself as a Shiite movement. Its secretary general says it does not represent a certain sect, stressing that sectarianism only serves the enemies' best interests. He also denies that the movement only consists of Shiites and does not accept Sunni members. In January 2016, Hisham Salim, founder of the Harakat al-Sabireen, told the Palestinian Ma'an News Agency that the group, like Hezbollah, is directly funded by the Iranian government, but stressed that his group was non-sectarian, non-religious and certainly not a \\"Shiite movement.\\" References Category:Organizations established in 2014 Category:National liberation movements Category:Jihadist groups in Palestine Category:Palestinian militant groups Category:Palestinian terrorism Category:Anti-Zionism in the Palestinian territories Category:Resistance movements Category:Shia Islamist groups Category:Axis of Resistance Category:Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by Canada Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by the United States ","title":"Sabireen Movement"},{"id":"57824115","text":"Plessis is an unincorporated community in Lincoln Township, O'Brien County, Iowa, United States.

The bridge was designed by Percy Allan and built in 1888 by Taylor and Littleproud. The bridge is also known as the Vacy Bridge over Paterson River. The property is owned by Roads and Maritime Services, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000.  History  Allan truss bridges Timber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the New South Wales road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction. Timber truss bridges were preferred by the Public Works Department from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at Newcastle in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England. Allan trusses were the first truly scientifically engineered timber truss bridges, and incorporate American design ideas for the first time. This is a reflection of the changing mindset of the NSW people, who were slowly accepting that American ideas could be as good as or better than European ones. The high quality and low cost of the Allan truss design entrenched the dominance of timber truss bridges for NSW roads for the next 30 years. Percy Allan, the designer of Allan truss and other bridges, was a senior engineer of the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in late 19th century NSW. Timber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \\"timber bridge state\\". The Vacy bridge The current bridge at Vacy was built in 1898 after the previous bridge was destroyed by fire in late 1896. It was completed at an approximate cost of A¬£1,750.  Description  The Vacy Bridge is an Allan-type timber truss road bridge. It has two timber truss spans, each of . There is a single timber approach span at one end and none at the other giving the bridge an overall length of . The super structure is supported by timber trestles and provides a single-lane carriage way with a minimum width of . The guard rail is of timber post and rail construction and extends the full length of the bridge. The bridge was reported to be in good condition as at 15 June 2005.  Heritage listing  Completed in 1898, the Vacy bridge is an early example of an Allan type timber truss road bridge, and in 1998 was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Percy Allan, the designer of this type of truss. Allan trusses were third in the five-stage design evolution of NSW timber truss bridges, and were a major improvement over the McDonald trusses which preceded them. Allan trusses were 20% cheaper to build than McDonald trusses, could carry 50% more load, and were easier to maintain. The Vacy bridge is located in the Hunter Region, which has 15 historic bridges each constructed before 1905, and it gains heritage significance from its proximity to the high concentration of other historic bridges in the area. In 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Vacy bridge is a representative example of Allan timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being State significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance. The Vacy Bridge over Paterson River was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Through the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Percy Allan, it has historical significance. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has a small amount of aesthetic significance. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Timber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \\"timber truss bridge state\\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW. The Vacy bridge is valued by the people of the Patterson and Vacy districts. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Rare; in 1998 there were 38 surviving Allan trusses in NSW of the 105 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The bridge is representative of Allan truss bridges.

She has won numerous Japanese literary and dramatic awards, including the Akutagawa Prize, the Noma Literary New Face Prize, the Mishima Yukio Prize, the Kenzaburo Oe Prize, the Kishida Kunio Drama Award, and the Tsuruya Nanboku Drama Award. Her work has been adapted multiple times for film. Early life and education Motoya was born in Hakusan, Ishikawa. As a child she read mystery stories by Agatha Christie, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Edogawa Ranpo, as well as horror manga. After completing high school, Motoya moved to Tokyo to study acting, and won a voice acting role in the Hideaki Anno anime adaptation of Kare Kano, but switched her focus to writing after a teacher praised a short play Motoya wrote for the school's graduation ceremony. She founded her own theater company, called Gekidan Motoyo Yukiko (Motoya Yukiko Theater Company), in 2000, and began writing and staging her own plays.  Career   Novelist  In 2002, prompted by a magazine editor's invitation, Motoya made her fiction debut with the short story Eriko to zettai (Eriko and Absolutely). It became the title story of a 2003 collection published by Kodansha. Her novel Funuke domo kanashimi no ai o misero (Funuke Show Some Love, You Losers!) was published in 2005. It was adapted into the 2007 Daihachi Yoshida film Funuke Show Some Love, You Losers!, starring Eriko Sato and Hiromi Nagasaku, which was shown at the Cannes Film Festival. Motoya's novel ', about an unemployed and apparently depressed woman's relationship with her boyfriend, was published in 2006 by Shinchosha. Ikiteru dake de ai was nominated for the Akutagawa Prize, and was later adapted into a 2018 film of the same name. Motoya's 2009 novel Ano ko no kangaeru koto wa hen (That Girl's Got Some Strange Ideas) was nominated for the 141st Akutagawa Prize. She was nominated a third time for her 2011 novel Nurui doku (Warm Poison), about a woman who has a relationship with a pathological liar claiming to be a former high school classmate. Though Nurui doku did not win the Akutagawa Prize, it won the 33rd Noma Literary New Face Prize. Motoya subsequently won the 7th Kenzaburo Oe Prize for her 2012 collection Arashi no pikunikku (Picnic in the Storm), and the 27th Mishima Yukio Prize for her 2013 novel Jibun wo suki ni naru houhou. In 2016, on her fourth nomination, Motoya won the 154th Akutagawa Prize for her story Irui konin tan (Tales of Marriage to a Different Sort), in which a wife discovers that she and her husband look more and more alike as they grow older together. At the prize ceremony the press commented on her mismatched socks, leading Motoya to admit that she had not expected to win, and had rushed to the prize ceremony without any special preparation. The prize-winning work became the title story of a collection of four stories published later that year by Kodansha. In 2018 a collection of Motoya's stories, translated into English by Asa Yoneda, was published under the title The Lonesome Bodybuilder in the United States. It included a new translation of Irui konin tan under the title \\"An Exotic Marriage\\". Writing for The New York Times, Weike Wang praised Motoya's stories, noting that Motoya \\"wins over her audience by pushing the absurd to extremes\\". Nilanjana Roy, in her review for the Financial Times, concluded that \\"Yukiko Motoya‚Äôs shivery, murmuring voice will never completely leave you\\".  Playwright and director  Motoya continued writing and directing plays for her theatre company while also writing short stories and novels, and in 2006 she became the youngest person ever to win the Tsuruya Nanboku Memorial Award for Best Play, which she received for her play S≈çnan (Distress). That same year she visited the United States as part of a Japan Foundation-sponsored exchange program for playwrights.

It was also known as the Royal Oak Inn. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The exact date of the construction of the Royal Oak Inn remains unknown, however it is certain that it was built in the 1840s as a residence for Dr. Issac Scott Nind. Dr Nind was a surgeon stationed at Paterson to attend to convict gangs working in the area. In 1853 William Morris Read purchased the property from Dr Nind and kept a wine and spirit store until his return to England in 1858. Edward William Long bought the building in 1858, using it as a store until 1861, when he obtained a liquor license and began operating it as an inn, the 'Royal Oak'. He died in 1864. Daniel Long took over as licensee in 1865-66, Ellen Long in 1867 and Daniel Long again in 1868. An Elephannan Puxty was licensee from 1869 to 1877, George Seabrooke or Scabrooke from 1877 to 1879, and Thomas Swift from 1879 until 1881. The hotel was de-licensed in 1881, and the hotel contents were sold at auction in April 1882, as Swift was leaving the district. From 1882 to 1902 the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney used the premises as a bank until in 1902 it moved into new premises across the street. From 1902 to 1915 the premises were rented by Mr and Mrs Williamson who ran a small mixed business store including a barber, billiard room and refreshments. William John McGill purchased the premises in 1915 and used the hotel as the family residence and the kitchen outbuildings as a butchering establishment. McGill had his brother in law Mr J. Thompson, a builder, demolish the front verandah and build the two storey verandah that still stands today. In 1930 William McGill died and left the property to his daughters. Walter McGill purchased his brothers and two sister's share of the property and became the family home. The kitchen outbuildings continued to be used as a Butchers shop. In 1968 Mr McGill subdived the allotments and sold the portion of land now known as Lot 55. The Royal Oak Arms Hotel was separated from the outbuildings. Since 1968 the building as passed through a number of hands and has been uninhabited for the majority of that time. In 1979 concerned for the lack of maintenance of the building, residents of Paterson requested the Heritage Council to take action under the Heritage Act to conserve the building. The action was also supported by the National Trust. On 6 March 1981 a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the Royal Oak Inn. In 1987 through the Heritage Assistance Program funding was made available to assist in the restoration work being undertaken to the Royal Oak Inn. In 1994 the Heritage Council approved work for the restoration of the front verandah. On 2 April 1999 the Royal Oak Inn was transferred to the State Heritage Register.  Description  The Royal Oak Arms Inn is situated in what was once the busy commercial centre of the township of Paterson. It is a two-storey brick rendered building designed in the early Colonial Georgian style. Its original single-storey street verandah was replaced in the late 1900s with the two storey federation Style verandah that still stands today. A doorway was cut into the wall at the first floor to allow access onto the verandah. The original timber shingles to the hipped and skillion roof have been overlaid with sheets of corrugated iron. The verandah addition is sheeted with corrugated iron and has a bull nose edge. The original twelve paned windows were replaced with four pan windows before the turn of the century. The windows were shuttered. A number of the original elegant French doors to the ground floor rear verandah remain, however their shutters no longer exist. The early twentieth century additions have altered the character of the building slightly but not adversely affected its appearance within the streetscape.  Heritage listing  The Royal Oak Arms Inn is historically significant as a building that has stood for over 135 years within the centre of Paterson. The use of the building has changed to suit the needs of the town. The history of the building is strongly linked to the original settlement of Paterson and with its subsequent growth and development. It begun as a residence for the convict surgeon, was used as an inn, hotel, bank, small store and residence as the township developed.

The Ensemble Espa√±ol consists of the professional dance company, touring nationally and internationally throughout the year, as well as the youth company. The Ensemble Espa√±ol provides arts education programming to students across Chicago, runs community outreach programs/workshops, offers college level dance courses at Northeastern Illinois University, and produces the annual American Spanish Dance and Music Festival. The company was founded in 1975 by Dame Libby Komaiko, American classical dancer and educator, with a mission to preserve, promote and present the flamenco, folkloric, classical, and contemporary dance and music traditions of Spain. After returning from a four- week study at the Boston Conservatory of Music with Spanish artists Nana Lorca and Jose Greco in 1976 (funded by Northeastern Illinois University and the Union of Puerto Rican Students), Komaiko formally launched the Ensemble Espa√±ol with just seven students. Komaiko fostered a family atmosphere throughout the years often creating choreographies for specific dancers while offering various organizational roles to others who didn't want to leave the family. Some of Komaiko's earliest dancers, Irma Suarez Ruiz, who began training with Komaiko in 1979, as well as Jorge P√©rez, who began training with Komaiko in 1985, are still with the company today. Ruiz and P√©rez, dance partners, still perform in Komaiko's signature piece ‚ÄúBolero‚Äù (1993) even though Ruiz now serves as the Artistic Director while P√©rez is the Executive and the Associate Artistic Director.  Professional company  Today the company consists of over 40 dancers, singers, musicians and administrative staff. It presents over one hundred Spanish dance educational programs a year, reaching nearly 20,000 students in arts education programming. The Ensemble Espa√±ol has trained over 95 professional dancers, taught over 7,800 academic Spanish dance class students at Northeastern Illinois University, and performed over 135 original full-length choreographies and over 4,000 concerts worldwide. The Ensemble Espa√±ol has collaborated with the Chicago Human Rhythm Project and its Stomping Ground Festival, the Flamenco Festival produced by Instituto Cervantes, and the Auditorium Theatre at Roosevelt University's \\"Made in Chicago\\" dance series. The Ensemble Espa√±ol has toured nationally and internationally, including in Mexico, Australia, Puerto Rico, China, Costa Rica, Poland, and Spain. The Ensemble has performed at the Chicago Dancing Festival, the annual Dance for Life benefit, the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival Inside/Out Series, and Dance St. Louis. The Ensemble Espa√±ol has studied and collaborated with Spanish dancers and artists including Manolete, Juanjo Linares, Nana Lorca, Lola Montes, Jos√© Greco, Manuel Reyes, Paco Romero, Maria Alba, Maria Magdalena, Candela Soto, Edo, Paco Alonso, Roberto Lorca, Paloma Gomez, Carmela Greco, and the National Ballet of Spain founding members, Juan Mata and Ana Gonzalez. In 1983, King Juan Carlos I, King of Spain, awarded Ensemble Espa√±ol founder Libby Komaiko, the honor of the Lazo de Dama (Ribbon of the Dame) de Isabel la Catolica for spreading the cultural and artistic values of Spain throughout the U.S. Other honors have included White House President Barack Obama sending Ensemble Espa√±ol a letter recognizing the organization's work, as well as the creation of three endowed scholarships for Ensemble Espa√±ol dancers to attend Northeastern Illinois University and one foundation endowment for the general operating programs of the organization.  Youth company  In 1985, committed to bringing this culturally specific art form and education to a range of students across the city to change lives, Komaiko and Lillian Hemnover, executive director of the Frederick Funston School, launched the Ensemble Espa√±ol's youth company. The Youth Company contains the Junior Division (ages 10‚Äì18) and the Senior Division (18+). The Youth Company functions as a pre-professional training program to the professional company, which holds annual auditions. The Youth Company performs at annual holiday concerts, the annual American Spanish Dance and Music Festival, and the Our Chance to Dance Youth Festival. Curated and produced by Ensemble Espa√±ol, the Our Chance to Dance Youth Festival invites other training academies to participate in master classes, special events, and a final performance. Past participants include Kuumba Lynx, Move Me Soul, ChiArts, Chicago Lights, Ballet Chicago, the Joel Hall Dance Youth Ensemble, the Red Clay Youth Ensemble, and the Natya Dance Theatre Youth Ensemble.  Classes and community workshops  The annual American Spanish Dance and Music Festival is a two-week event held each June at a range of venues, including Northeastern Illinois University, the North Shore Center for The Performing Arts, and the Old Town School of Folk Music, among others. Activities consist of three concert length performances, master classes and workshops, musical concerts, and seminars and panel discussions. The master classes, open to the public, are targeted to aspiring and established dancers throughout the region. The festival has involved the works and performances of artists and choreographers such as Juan Mata and Ana Gonzales, founding members of the National Ballet of Spain; Camela Greco, master dancer, choreographer, and daughter of legendary Jose Greco; Paloma Gomez, former principal dancer with the National Ballet of Spain; Rachel Gomez, former principal dancer and rehearsal mistress of the National Ballet of Spain, and many others. In addition, the Ensemble Espa√±ol conducts a variety of community workshops for all ages and levels of experience throughout the year as well a college credit dance courses at Northeastern Illinois University.  Arts education programs  The Paso A Paso, or Step by Step, education program, created and taught by professional dance educators, focuses on Flamenco, folkloric, and classical dance instruction in three formats for young students and dancers. The three components of Ensemble Espa√±ol's Paso a Paso Arts Education Program are: Spain's Dancing Rhythms consists of a 45-minute lecture/demonstration, led by a professional dancer, that covers Spanish dance and music vocabulary, instruments, rhythms, and the history and styles of Spanish dance. Tales of Spain consists of an hour-long concert style performance, with professionally dancers typically presented in Northeastern Illinois University's auditorium, and a lecture designed to teach children about Spanish dance styles and the cultures that influenced their origins. ¬°Bailamos! Residencies consist of an eight-week (or longer) schedule with curriculum that concentrates on dance movement and expression, teamwork, Spanish dance technique, and the three styles of Spanish dance. In addition to Paso a Paso, the Ensemble Espa√±ol participates in the After School Matters program, founded by the late Chicago First Lady, Margaret Daley. The organization teaches Spanish dance in four Chicago public schools during a full school year.

Biography  Yaron Kanner was born in Holon in 1968. He studied at the Netiv Meir High School in Jerusalem and later at Yeshivat Ateret Cohanim (today known as Yeshivat Ateret Yerushalayim). He served in the \\"Shimshon\\" undercover unit in the IDF during the First Intifada and then as a reserve officer.‚òÉ‚òÉ‚òÉ‚òÉ‚òÉ‚òÉ In the 1990s, he served as a correspondent for Israel Radio's Channel 2 network and, was among the first reporters to broadcast live on Israel Radio that shots had been fired at then-prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.‚òÉ‚òÉ‚ÜµAfter working as a journalist, he began to study social law. As a lawyer, he served as the director of the Legal Department of the Tebeka Association and led legal battles against the private and institutional discrimination of members of the Ethiopian community. He was one of the attorneys which handled the legal struggle in the affair of the \\"Nezer Etzion\\" school in Petach Tikvah, whose students (except one) were members of the Ethiopian community. In 2012-2013 he served as CEO of the Kol BaRama radio station, following that he became director of Panim ‚Äì the Association of Israeli Jewish Organizations. In 2016 founded the Hinam Center for Social Tolerance. Kanner holds a master's degree in law from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and is a PhD student of sociology at AMU. His research examines the tools for promoting social tolerance. In 2018, Kenner was selected by Israel Today Newspaper as one of the \\"Seventy Israelis You Must Know.\\"  As a Journalist  About two months before the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, Kanner entered the Eyal organization, where Yigal Amir was a member. During his recruitment period, Avishai Raviv visited his home, and Kanner also held meetings with Yigal Amir and Hagai Amir in Hebron. He agreed to join the organization as a weapons instructor. Kanner's intention for having these meetings was for him to evaluate the organizations intentions in light of their public threats against Yitzhak Rabin. The investigation was planned to continue for several months, but the timetable was interrupted by Rabin's assassination, after which Kanner immediately published a series of articles detailing his investigation. Kanner served, at the time, as a reporter for the Israel Radio network. On November 4, 1995, he was sent by the radio network to cover the \\"Yes to Peace, No to Violence\\" rally held at Malkhei Yisrael Square (today Rabin Square in Tel Aviv). Kanner was one of the first reporters to report that shots were fired at Yitzhak Rabin as he descended the back stairs of the stage. In 1996, Kanner conducted an investigation into forced psychiatric hospitalization, during which he managed to get himself hospitalized at the Abarbanel Psychiatric Hospital for four days. The investigation showed that the district psychiatrist was not conducting the necessary tests before ordering forced hospitalization. Following a series of articles published on the subject, an investigation committee was set up by the Ministry of Health, and some of the legal requirements relating to forced hospitalization were changed.  In the World of Tolerance  Kanner promotes a tolerant society through a long and meaningful acquaintance with the other. The Hinam Center that he founded applies this approach through in-depth journeys into the Israeli society where participants live \\"the lives of others\\" and spend extended periods of time in various communities in Israeli society (ultra-Orthodox, Arabs, settlers, Ethiopians, etc.). The president of Israel and his wife, Reuven and Nehama Rivlin greet Yaron Kanner In 2016, President Reuven Rivlin met members of one of the Hinam Center's groups after they completed a four-month journey between communities in Israel. The President noted that this is the way to truly recognize Israeli society in all its forms. As part of the 71st Independence Day events, the President of the State awarded the Center, which Kanner founded, the Unity Award.

It was built from 1868 to 1869. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Clarence Town The area was originally inhabited by the Wanaruah Aboriginal people who called it Erringhi. There is a hotel in the main street of Clarence Town built in 1913 called The Erringhi Hotel. The township is most famous for building and launching the William IV paddle steamer in 1831, although the town was still called Erringhi at this time. It was later renamed in 1832 after the Duke of Clarence, who became King William IV in 1830. Clarence Town like many places on the Hunter River, Paterson River and Williams River was first visited by timber getters, with land grants made as early as 1825. With its deep water river frontages, Clarence Town was early a place from which timber and other goods could be transported and many of the grantees further up the Williams River made application for small grants at this head of navigation to establish stores for their produce awaiting transhipment. Clarence Town was proclaimed a town in 1832, the third in the Hunter district after Newcastle and Maitland, and provided with a generous street plan. Also established here was a shipbuilding industry where Australia's first ocean-going steamer was built. The early establishment of relatively small farms on the river and the ease of river transport led to rapid growth. Along with tobacco factories and steam driven flour mills, one of the earliest National Schools was founded here in 1849. Despite its early establishment and river traffic, Clarence Town was not provided with services as quickly as either nearby Paterson or Dungog. By the 1860s, regular coach services connected the steamer services of Clarence Town with Dungog and other rural towns, and a new courthouse was erected in 1869. In the 1880s, many of Clarence Town's most prominent public buildings and private houses were built and it was in this period that the functional river steamers began to be supplemented by pleasure cruises from Newcastle. Although the decline of Clarence Town in the 20th century is generally attributed to the railway route running through Dungog, there is evidence that even before this it was affected by the tobacco tax, four floods and the depression of the 1890s.(Karskens, Dungog Heritage Study, in website: History in the Williams River Valley). When Wallarobba Shire was formed in 1906, it remained based at Dungog and from the reports of its deliberations in the Dungog Chronicle rarely, if ever, concerned itself with its smaller towns such as Clarence Town or Gresford. Clarence Town seems to have been left to its own devices as far as town management was concerned and possibly had a Town Committee, though what its legal status was is unclear; certainly a Progress Association also existed to help with local improvements. Clarence Town was the area's centre for shipping until the railway reached Dungog in 1911. The slow decline in Clarence Town's population has reversed in recent times as it has gradually transformed into a commuter suburb for those working in Newcastle. Court House The Clarence Town Courthouse was built in 1868‚Äì69. The design has been attributed to either Colonial Architect James Barnet (State Heritage Register) or Clerk of Works for the Northern District of the Department of Public Works, Mortimer William Lewis Jr (Dungog Shire Conservation Management Plan). It served as a Court of Petty Sessions for Clarence Town and District from 1869 to 1970. It then became the local police station from 1970 until 1987. In 1990, it was adapted to its current use as the Clarence Town and District Historical Museum. The former court house building is now the site of a local history museum which focuses on Clarence Town as a terminal of navigation and river port. Its collection encompasses shipbuilding, exploration, maps, documents photographs, memorabilia, household items, timber-getting, agriculture and the history of the settlement of Williams River. In addition to the above, a native cottage garden is in the process of being established, together with a replica pioneer settlers cottage about to be constructed, materials on site, containing names, photographs (where available), and information on Pioneer Settlers; all surrounded by native trees. In this manner there will be provided a background to Clarence Town's heritage and a support to the Historical Museum. In April 2018, the Dungog Shire Council resolved to transfer the building to the Clarence Town Progress Association as neither the financially strapped council nor the museum could afford the cost of building maintenance. This was credited by the Dungog Chronicle with \\"ending years of uncertainty over the site\\".  Description  The Clarence Town Courthouse is a two-storey timber building in the Victorian Georgian style with steep gabled corrugated galvanised iron roof and integral hipped verandah roof. It is associated with the nineteenth century police station/residence adjacent. The courthouse is essentially unchanged from its original design, as no major additions or alterations have been undertaken throughout its history. The interior is divided into four main rooms: the court room, the police office, the magistrates' room, and storerooms (former meeting room).  Heritage listing  Clarence Town Courthouse was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

The business routes in the US state of Texas are traditionally short spurs or loops that connect the main route, in this case, U.S. Route 83 (US 83), to the center or commercial district of a city. The routes commonly follow the course of an decommissioned state highway, or the old course of the main route. Business routes are signed with the traditional US 83 highway shield, and with a small \\"business plate\\" placed above the marker. TxDOT regards business routes as official highways, and is responsible for the maintenance of the route. Abilene Business US Route 83-D (Bus. US 83-D) is a business loop of US 83 that passes through Abilene. Bus. US 83-D begins at an interchange with US 83 / US 84 / Loop 322 near Kibry Lake. The highway travels in a northern direction along Treadwaway Boulevard through an industrial area of the city, seeing more development along its route north of Industrial Boulevard. Bus. US 83-D travels in a northeast direction between Jeanette Street and South 14th Street, intersects SH 36, then has a short overlap with BL I-20 near downtown. The highway travels just east of the city's downtown area through a large commercial area, with development along the route decreasing north of SH 351 near Hardin-Simmons University. The Treadaway Boulevard designation ends at Pine Street, with Bus. US 83-D running along that street. North of Hardin-Simmons, the highway's route becomes more rural with some industrial areas and has an interchange with I-20 southeast of Impact. Bus. US 83-D turns northwest near Huckleberry Road and travels through rural areas of the city before ending at an interchange with US 83 / US 277 near FM 3034. Bus. US 83-D was designated in 1990 when Loop 243 was decommissioned. ;Junction list Laredo Business US Route 83-K (Bus. US 83-K) is a former business loop of US 83 that was located in Laredo. Bus.

It is the most widespread of the geomorphic sections in the New England Province, extending from Canada through New England down to the Seaboard section and extending southwestward through New York and New Jersey as two narrow upland projections, the Reading Prong and the Manhattan Prong. Numerous hills and mountains rise above the general level of the upland; except in the presence of mountains, the horizon of the regional landscape is fairly level. Glaciation has resulted in the erosion and rounding off of the bedrock topography and numerous rock basin lakes. Glacial drift is thin, patchy, and stony, and ice-contact features such as kames, kame terraces, and eskers are abundant. The surface of the New England Uplands slopes southeast from maximum inland altitudes around 670 meters (2,200 feet), excluding the other mountainous sections of the province, to about 122 to 152 meters (400 to 500 feet) along its seaward edge at the narrow coastal Seaboard section, which goes down to sea level. In the New York Bight watershed, the New England Uplands section is represented by a portion of the Taconic Mountains and its foothills, and by the Reading and Manhattan Prongs that extend southwestward from the New England states. Although geologists refer to the larger of these extensions as the Reading Prong, in this region it is more commonly known as the New York - New Jersey Highlands, and locally as the Hudson Highlands, the New Jersey Highlands, the Ramapo Mountains, or simply the Highlands. The Highlands are bounded on the southeast and on the northwest by the lowlands of the Piedmont and Great Valley provinces, respectively. The mountains and valleys that make up the Highlands are part of a relatively long, linear, and narrow regional geological feature that averages 16 to 32 kilometers (10 to 20 miles) in width, with a maximum width of 40 kilometers (25 miles), and extends in a southwest-northeast trending direction for nearly 225 kilometers (140 miles), from southeastern Pennsylvania near Pennsylvania, to southwestern Connecticut in the vicinity of Danbury, where it joins the Taconic Mountains and Housatonic Highlands of the New England Uplands plateau. The Hudson River cuts a deep gorge through the Highlands in New York in the stretch of river between Peekskill on the south and Newburgh on the north.

It is found on just four of the twelve island groups where tuatara survive, preferring islands where the reptiles live in high densities. Larvae, nymphs, and adults all feed exclusively on tuatara blood, and ticks can survive for up to a year without a host. When tuatara are translocated, the tick has been lost or survives only in low densities in the new population. Description and taxonomy Adult tuatara ticks are nearly circular, light brown and long. They were first described by Lionel Jack Dumbleton in 1943. The holotype male specimen was collected from Stephens Island by E. J. Tillyard in January 1922 and later deposited in the New Zealand Arthropod Collection. Originally, this species was placed in the genus Aponomma, as members of this genus mostly parasitise reptiles. More primitive Aponomma were placed into the genus Amblyomma in 2002. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that this tick is not closely related to other ticks in the genus Amblyomma and it may need to be placed in its own genus.  Distribution  Like its host, this species has populations living on islands off the coast of the North Island and South Island of New Zealand. However, its distribution is confined to only four of the twelve island groups: the Mercury and Aldermen Islands off the coast of the North Island, and Stephens Island and the Trios in Cook Strait. Islands with a high density of tuatara, with increased association between hosts, are more likely to have ticks present, as the parasite has limited mobility and would find it difficult to disperse where tuatara densities are lower or fluctuate. Life cycle The tick has a three-stage life cycle, with all stages parasitising the tuatara. Females that have fed on the host's blood detach from the tuatara and lay eggs. This occurs in the tuatara's burrow. When the eggs hatch, the larvae attach to a tuatara, feed and detach. After moulting, the resulting nymph also attaches and repeats the cycle of feeding, detaching and moulting to become an adult tick. This life cycle may take 2‚Äì3 years. Increased temperatures may cause an increase in copulation on adult ticks and faster development rates of all life cycle stages.  Ecology  Tuatara ticks on the body of their host, Sphenodon punctatus Tuatara are reptiles that use burrows for shelter. Their ticks can spend over one year off their host and prefer the moist and dark habitats provided by these burrows. Their preference for humid and dark conditions may be an adaptive feature for remaining inside or finding burrows where the host resides. If copulation takes place off the host, ticks may use pheromones to locate a mate. Tuatara live in a variety of habitats and are parasitised by ticks in all of them. The density of ticks on tuatara are higher when the host lives in pasture than in canopy forest. Tuatara ticks mirror the nocturnal activity of tuatara. They are more mobile at night, which could increase the chance of unattached ticks finding a host. It could also reduce the likelihood of desiccation due to the increased humidity at night. They prefer attaching in positions on the back of the host, folds in the skin of the rear legs and the side of the body. Once attached, they feed on the host's blood. Unfed adult ticks have been observed to survive for over one year without their host.  Conservation  This species is less widespread than its host. When translocation of tuatara has occurred, tick densities are lower or absent in the new population. Some tuatara have had the parasite removed before translocation and other populations of tuatara have lost the parasite afterwards. Its conservation status is relict, as ‚Äì like its host ‚Äì it once occupied a wider distribution.

He moved back to the Pacific Northwest to complete an Master of Fine Arts degree at University of Washington under the direction of Richard Kenney (poet) and Linda Bierds. There, under the auspices of study abroad programs, he first began taking the trips to Rome that would become a recurrent feature in his poetry. Willett stayed at University of Washington for a Ph.D. focusing on Romanticism, during which time he first began to appreciate the Spasmodic poets. While writing his dissertation, he spent a year as scholar-in-residence at University of T√ºbingen in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, where he gave a public poetry reading in the H√∂lderlinturm. There, he began work on the impressions of Rainer Maria Rilke that would form his second book, The Elegy Beta. Willett is married to the choreographer Amber Willett. They have two children. Currently, Willett teaches on the English faculty at Seattle Pacific University]. Academic Career Willett's published research focuses mainly on British Romantic poets such as Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Spasmodic poets such as Alexander Smith, and Philip James Bailey.  Published Works   Poetry  Phases is a book of largely religious poems that are often ironic or humorous. It was listed among the \\"Best Books 2017\\" by the Washington Independent Review of Books. The poems have been compared stylistically to the poems of Richard Wilbur and noted for their interest in Italian culture and classical civilizations. Willett's second book, The Elegy Beta is an extended meditation on angels as represented in The Duino Elegies by Rainer Maria Rilke. It was the first poetry book published by Mockingbird Press. The book has been stylistically and thematically compared to the Metaphysical poets especially John Donne, and to John Berryman.

He was suffect consul in an undetermined nundinium around AD 150.G√©za Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand unter der Antoninen (Bonn: Rudolf Habelt Verlag 1977), pp. 202 He is known entirely from inscriptions. Dentilianus came from a family of Roman Africa, perhaps originally from Carthage.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 317 His father has been identified as Quintus Caecilius Marcellus, praetor around the year 115;Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 202 although the name of his wife is not known, his son is identified as Quintus Caecilius Dentilianus, consul in 167.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 203  Life  His cursus honorum is known from an inscription set up at Thibiuca, north of Carthage. The earliest office Dentilianus held was in the decemviri stlitibus judicandis, one of the four boards that formed the vigintiviri; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward a gaining entry into the Roman Senate. Next he was commissioned military tribune with Legio XI Claudia, stationed at Durostorum (modern Silistra) on the lower Danube. He returned to Rome where he assumed the traditional Republican magistracy of quaestor, served in the public province of Africa. Upon completion of this office Dentilianus would be enrolled in the Senate. Two more traditional Republican magistracies followed‚Äîplebeian tribune and praetor‚Äîboth as candidate of the emperor Hadrian. Alf√∂ldy dates his tenure as praetor between the years 134 and 138. After he completed his term as praetor, Dentilianus served as legatus or assistant to governors of two public provinces. The first province was Crete and Cyrenaica; the second was Hispania Baetica. Alf√∂ldy dates his tenure in these positions, similar to modern internships and were held at the pleasure of the governors of those provinces, to successive years, c. 136/137 and c. 137/138 respectively.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 343 After these postings, the sortition gave Dentilianus the opportunity to govern a province on his own, which was Crete and Cyrenaica. This province was not favored by senators, due to its elements‚Äîthe island of Crete and Cyrenaica in North Africa‚Äîwere separated by the Mediterranean Sea, making governing the province more difficult. The date he governed this province lacks a firm date: Alf√∂ldy tentatively dates his tenure to the term 139/140, while Werner Eck dates it with less precision to either the last years of Hadrian's reign or the first few of Antoninus Pius.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 252; Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\\", Chiron, 13 (1983), pp. 192f Dentilianus eventually received his first imperial appointment after this, a commission as legatus or commander of Legio XII Fulminata, which was stationed on the Eastern frontier, either in Cappadocia or Armenia; Alf√∂ldy dates his tenure in this post from circa 141 to circa 144.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 301 This was followed by an appointment as governor of the imperial province of Gallia Aquitania, which Alf√∂ldy between the years 146 and 149, or just prior to the time Dentilianus acceded to the consulate, while Eck dates it with less precision again to either the last years of Hadrian's reign or the first few of Antoninus Pius.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 263; Eck, \\"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten\\", p. 189 We lack details for his life after Dentilianus stepped down from the consulate. Alf√∂ldy dates his age when he left the consulate as at least 46; based on our knowledge of demographics of the Roman Empire, Dentilianus could be expected to live about 16 more years, so this silence may be more due to lack of information than he died shortly after his consulate.

Twenty years later, however, he still seems to be stuck with a 'formula' of cinema that worked in the 1990s. In 2018, all you get is a lifeless love story. As an audience, you want a bit more than that.\\" 123 Telugu rated the film 2.75/5 and considered that: \\"Tej I Love You is the same old love story which Karunakaran has made many a time in the past. There is nothing new which this film showcases. Bad songs, lack of interesting romance and forced elements sidetrack the film.\\" Hans India rated the film 2.25/5 and remarked that: \\"Rather than focusing on the main plot, the makers unnecessarily included a lot of elements in the movie. The first half completely is about the teasing game between the hero and heroine and the second half is all about how hero wins back his love.\\" Greatandhra rated 2.5/5 and wrote, \\"is an outdated romantic drama that tests the patience to the maximum.

The petals are long, wide, asymmetrically egg-shaped with a small upturned tip. The labellum is flat, long, wide, with short red calli near its base. The central part of the labellum is covered with coppery red hairs up to long and there is a glandular tip which is long. The column has two blackish \\"eyes\\" without a ridge between them. Flowering occurs from October to November but each flower only last between two and four days. Taxonomy and naming Calochilus pulchellus was first formally described in 2006 by David Jones from a specimen collected in the Morton National Park and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (pulchellus) is the diminutive form of the Latin word pulcher meaning \\"pretty\\", hence \\"pretty little\\", referring to the flowers of this species. Distribution and habitat The pretty beard orchid grows in low heath. It is only known from three sites in the Shoalhaven district. Conservation This orchid is listed as \\"endangered\\" under the New South Wales Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. The main threat to the species is its small population size.

Both governments of India and Nepal have begun studies for the preparation of a detailed project report (DPR) of the Project and Sun Kosi Storage-cum-Diversion Scheme. A Joint Project Office (JPO) was set up in Nepal for investigation of the project in August 2004. Background Koshi High Dam is a project that was studied, surveyed and revised by various authorities from centuries. In the history there were many notable heavy floods on Koshi river killing thousands and displacing millions people. To prevent losses first survey was conducted by British India Major J Renal in around 1779. Subsequently James Fargusan studied in 1863 and later A.F. Ceiling Field studied Koshi flood. British authority has reached to a decision of constructing embankments after the devastating flood of 1869-70. British made an agreement with Rana rulers of Nepal to construct dam in Sunsari and Saptari districts of Nepal but the project failed after the flood of May 1891. On 27 February 1897 Prime Minister Bir Shamsher Rana approved British India to construct a dam below Barahachhetra. Again in 1944 an American company studied for the British which suggested to construct dam in Churiya range. Following it a commission headed by Rayabahadur Ayodhyanath Khosala studied Koshi on ground in January 1946. He suggested to construct dam 1.6 Kilometer upstream from Barahakshetra area. After independence India Government formed commission headed by engineer S.P. Majumdar which suggested to construct 25.91 meter high dam in Belaka which ended up with Koshi Agreement 25 April 1954 and amended in 1966. Following the agreement India constructed the present Koshi Barrage (completed 24 April 1965) Construction of Koshi Barrage gave a great relief to people in Bihar for long time but even it couldn't solve the problem. Concept of Saptakoshi High Dam was reinstated after Indian P.M. Atal Bihari Vajpayee introduced Indian Rivers Inter-link project in 2005. Sapta Koshi River is one of the major tributary branch of the Ganges river system that originates from the Himalaya and meets Ganga at Bihar. Koshi causes floods in Nepal and India every year. A big landmass of Bihar is affected by Koshi flood every year. Therefore Koshi is known as ‚Äòsorrow of Bihar‚Äô Criticism From the very beginning, the project has been criticized. The main issue raised against the ambitious project is its environmental and social impact. As currently outlined, the dam would displace over 75,000 people from the land covered by the dam.

It is known for its green area and is the site of a traditional Erlanger flea market. Bohlenplatz is the location of a one-time German church that is now used under the name Kreuz+Quer - Haus der Kirche Erlangen as an event site for the Evangelical Lutheran deanery of Erlanger.  History  Bohlenplatz was known as the center of the German Reformed Church. In the 19th century, the name Polenplatz was established for this square as well as the adjacent eastern block. In 1872, the name was changed to its current name, Bohlenplatz, referencing the social environment and their confused reinterpretation of a building yard used by Polish carpenters. From 1933 to 1945, the square was named after anti- Semitic journalist and publisher Dietrich Eckart. The original single-story houses of the city's stocking makers and craftsmen were enlarged or rebuilt. The site was for scree and as a sand pit. In 1780, however, attempts were made to counteract this by planting trees. For example, mulberry trees were planted for sericulture in 1826. In 1887 an overall design was carried out that approximately corresponded to the present square. The last major redesign took place in 1982.Gisela Sch√ºtt: Bohlenplatz. In: Erlanger Stadtlexikon. The eastern half of the square was developed with the establishment of the new Building Office of the University in 1970. A 222 meter deep artesian well on the south-east corner of the Bohlenplatz was built between 1864 and 1869. It did not supply the desired quantities of water and was abandoned in 1945. In 1919, the city built one of the first two children's playgrounds in Erlangen on the Bohlenplatz.  Description  Erlanger's German former Church (2012) The Bohlenplatz is an approximately 200√ó80 meter square in the historical old town of Erlangen, arranged in a west‚Äìeast direction. Although it was not built until later, the square fits the pattern of Erlangen's New Town as a Baroque planned city. The square is bordered to the south by the Friedrichstra√üe- Luitpoldstra√üe street, to the north by the Obere Karlstra√üe-Marquardsenstra√üe street and the east by the √ñstliche Stadtmauerstra√üee-Waldstra√üe street. Raumerstra√üe starts from the southern extent. A footpath and cycle path in the \\"Flucht Krankenhausstra√üe-Holzgartenstra√üe\\" divide the square into two unequal parts. The former German Reformed Church occupies the western third. The eastern part is leafy and park-like. A children's playground is available. The eastern end is marked by the new building of the University Authorities which was built in 1970.

Following the Second World War and this long period of silence, he was solicited by music lovers all over the world. He was asked to play again in concert and in particular in 1950 for the bicentenary of the death of Johann Sebastian Bach: in front of his repeated refusal, his friends, and particularly the violinist Alexander Schneider, offered him to come and play at his house in Prades; Pablo Casals accepted. The greatest performers of his time could be found there: (Clara Haskil, Mieczys≈Çaw Horszowski, Isaac Stern, Marcel Tabuteau, Joseph Szigeti, Rudolf Serkin, Paul Tortelier, etc.) which made it a place of musical fervour Thus was born the Festival de Prades which has continued since that date, seeing the greatest chamber music performers in the world. Pablo Casals still participated at the age of ninety, conducting his oratorio El PessebreEl Pessebre (France Musique) (The Crib), a work written during the war on a poem by his friend . The Festival takes place, among other venues, in one of the jewels of Romanesque Catalonia, the Abbey of Saint-Michel-de-Cuxa, at the feet of the Canigou.

But a little later she reappeared, telling him that she was the daughter of Vivasvan, the Sun God, and that she would leave it to her father to decide whether she may marry the King. The King remained alone on the mountain for twelve days, trying to propitiate the Sun and directing his thoughts to his priest Vasishtha, who arrived soon, knowing by divine insight what was going on in the king‚Äôs mind. He offered to him to approach on his behalf the Sun God, who readily agreed to give his daughter Tapati to the King for the proposed marriage.

Founded in 2007 by Prince Feisal Al Hussein, GFP has worked with and empowered volunteer leaders of youth in 51 countries around the world to promote active tolerance and responsible citizenship in communities experiencing various forms of conflict and violence. The organisation is the leading Jordanian NGO, with a global ranking of #3 in peacebuilding and #26 overall by NGO Advisor's 2020 Top 500 NGOs in the World. As one of only two peace-through-sports organisations to be officially recognised by the International Olympic Committee, it uses carefully facilitated sport-based games, art, advocacy, dialogue, and empowerment activities to serve as an entry point for engaging children, youth, and adults, and to promote integrated education and sustained behavioural change.  History  Generations For Peace was founded as a peace-through-sports initiative of the Jordan Olympic Committee in 2007, but has since expanded to include art, advocacy, dialogue, and empowerment as tools to bring peace to communities facing division and conflict. Since its founding, the organisation has trained more than 16,000 volunteers and reached over 780,000 children, youth, and adults across Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East as of 2019. It has also been supported by a variety of partners, including the European Union, UNICEF, USAID, UNESCO, International Olympic Committee, Samsung, and the University of Oxford. Generations For Peace established a research institute, the Generations For Peace Institute, in 2010.In 2020, the organisation was ranked the best in Jordan and #26 in the world on a list of the \\"top 500 NGOs in the world\\" published by NGO Advisor in Geneva; additionally, it was placed third in the \\"peacebuilding\\" category.  Model  Generations For Peace uses a volunteer cascading model in which trained volunteers in turn train future volunteers in their home communities, ensuring that programmes and ideas are spread while remaining true to their original design.  Tools for Peacebuilding  Generations For Peace has trained youth volunteers in regions affected by conflict across 50 countries around the globe, empowering them to build lasting peace in their communities. To further this peacebuilding mission, GFP has developed and now implements five tools to bring about and promote peace in local settings. Sport For Peace uses sports- based games and activities that integrate peer-group and peacebuilding education, aiming to promote a sense of understanding and unity that transcends the divides found in typical day-to-day life in high-conflict communities.\\"International Study Released by the Generations for Peace Institute and Georgetown University Maps Global Initiatives in Sport for Peace and Development\\".

It was designed by James Barnet and built from 1869 to 1870 by Alfred Dorrey. The property is owned by Bundarra Community Purposes Reserve Trust. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The site for a court house at Bundarra was fixed on 11 August 1855, and tenders called on 22 February 1869 for the erection of a court house and Watch House evidently in one combined building. On 9 April 1869 it was notified that Alfred Dorrey was the successful tenderer for its construction to the design of James Barnet, the Colonial Architect, and the building was completed in 1870 at the cost of A¬£870 (original estimate A¬£900). The furniture cost 33 pound 14 shillings and 7 pence. Additions were recorded that year. Barnet had further alterations made to the court house in 1883, tenders being called on 14 November 1882, with G. Ross being given as the successful tenderer on 29 January 1883. More additions became necessary and a local man G. E. Henry of Bundarra was shown on 25 September 1899, as the contractor the work on both the court house and watch house section which was under the direction of the Government Architect, Walter Liberty Vernon who had succeeded Barnet in 1890. Vernon then had further additions to both parts of the building carried out in 1901 by William S. Mead and Company of Annandale, whose tender was given as accepted on 29 July 1901. More recently in 1938, a timber verandah addition was made on the north west corner of the Police residence section under a former Government Architect, Cobden Parkes. It would appear that a substantial part of the building dates from 1870 though the alterations and additions over the years evidently changed the internal planning thus the attached plan shows the relocation of the barrack room from the south side of the north west.  Description  The building is a single-storey brick building (in English bond brick) built in 1870 (with various alterations in 1883, 1889, 1901 and 1938) with timber floors and timber framed corrugated galvanised iron sheeted roof. Internal walls are plaster or timber boarding generally. From the spacing of the roof battens it appears the roof sheeting was originally slates. The building contains 16 rooms (including the Court Room and two cells) and two verandahs, and is built on a slightly elevated site above the main road through Bundarra (Uralla-Inverell Road).  Condition  As at 8 May 2017, the building was in generally fair to good condition structurally, and the interior has been renovated since 1987.  Heritage listing  As at 19 September 2003, the former Bundarra Police Station and Court House is significant because the building embodies the establishment, growth and evolution of one of the major influential public departments of NSW. The responsibilities and duties of this Department were of fundamental importance to the development of law enforcement after the introduction of the Police Regulation Act of 1862 NSW. The former Bundarra Police Station Court House has close associations with the development of the Region as a centre for Law Administration. The building also has close association with the Colonial Architect's Office and may be used to demonstrate the design philosophy of that Office in rural regions. The former Bundarra Police Station and Court House is a particularly well-known urban landmark in the town of Bundarra and makes a major contribution to the streetscape qualities of the Bendemeer and Oliver Streets Precinct. The quality of workmanship and the unique use of elements in this building has produced a pleasing and esteemed visual aesthetic. The building is a rare and unusual example of a \\"modified Victorian Georgian\\" style reminiscent of the earliest Australian buildings idioms into a system based on a utilitarian scale and use. The quality of the design, including its proportions, details and character are of a high standard. The inclusion of the former Bundarra Police Station and Court House on a number of Federal and local heritage registers underscores its widespread importance as an item of cultural heritage to the local and wider community. This importance is further demonstrated by the efforts of the Bundarra community and the Shire Council to development the \\"place\\" as a cultural tourist attraction demonstrating the importance of early Bundarra as a service centre and in law administration in this part of New South Wales.

A Holocaust survivor himself, Laub co-founded the Holocaust Survivors Film Project with Laurel Vlock. Retrieved 4 July 2018 This organization is the predecessor to the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies ‚Äì the world‚Äôs first archive of testimonies of Holocaust survivors, witnesses and bystanders recorded on video. The Fortunoff Video Archive provides guidance for documentation teams taking testimonies in other communities impacted by human rights abuses throughout the world. Retrieved 4 July 2018 Based on his experience as an interviewer of hundreds of survivors and as a testimony researcher, he developed an interview technique revolving around a concept of emphatic listening that helps witnesses deliver their testimony as a way of dealing with trauma, although this can be a painful and traumatic process in itself.  Biography  Laub was born into a Jewish family in CernƒÉu»õi, in Bukovina, Romania (today, Ukraine), where he received an Orthodox Jewish education. His father, Moshe Laub, was a merchant. In 1940, Dori and his parents were sent to the CarierƒÉ de piatrƒÉ (Romanian for \\"stone quarry\\") concentration/labor camp in Transnistria. Thanks to the ingenuity of his mother Klara, Dori and his parents managed to hide themselves while the Nazis liquidated the camp and sent its inhabitants to their deaths. They were then sent to a large Jewish ghetto in the town of Obodivka. Toward the end of the war, they moved around from camp to camp, and Dori and his mother lost contact with his father, who did not survive the war. In April 1944, Dori and his mother returned to his city of birth and the home of his mother's parents, who survived the war. In 1950, he immigrated to Israel with his mother. After spending one and a half years in an immigrant camp and the Tira refugee absorption camp (ma\`abara), they moved to Haifa. In 1955, Laub began studying medicine at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem‚Äôs Hadassah Medical School, where he completed his studies in 1962. He was then enlisted in the IDF, where he served as a medical officer in the Golani Brigade's 51st Battalion. In 1965 he was discharged and spent one year working at a psychiatric hospital in Acre. In 1966, he travelled to the United States to undertake advanced studies in psychiatry and psychoanalysis, during which he taught at the Harvard University Medical School and completed a two-year residency at the Austen Riggs Center. In 1969 he joined the Western New England Institute for Psychoanalysis and the faculty of Yale University‚Äôs Department of Psychiatry, where he became a clinical professor in 2004. Retrieved 4 July 2018  Research on testimony and trauma  In 1973, Laub returned to Israel to take part in the Yom Kippur War, during which he treated soldiers suffering from shell shock, or combat stress, on the northern front. Laub recognized that many of the Israeli soldiers who suffered from shell shock during the war were first and second generation Holocaust survivors. In the course of the war, he began to formulate his unique approach to trauma as manifested in time and space, in different events, and between generations. Retrieved 4 July 2018 In 1979, in cooperation with documentary filmmaker and television producer Laurel Vlock, he established the world's first sustained project to record Holocaust survivors on video: the Holocaust Survivors Film Project. The first 183 recordings for this project were deposited at Yale University Library in 1981, laying the cornerstone for the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies, which over the years has assembled more than 4,400 testimonies regarding more than 30 communities across the United States, South America, Europe, and Israel. The archive made it possible to research the social, cultural, and historical significance of personal audiovisual testimonies regarding the Holocaust and other traumatic historical events. Additional testimony archives pertaining to the Holocaust and other humanitarian tragedies were established in its wake, including the Shoah Foundation (Steven Spielberg‚Äôs testimony collection project) and archives documenting the massacres in Rwanda and Bosnia. In 1992, in collaboration with literary scholar Shoshana Felman, Laub wrote and published Testimony: Crises of Witnessing in Literature, Psychoanalysis and History, in which, based on his experiences as an interviewer of hundreds of witnesses, he analyzes the role of the listener of testimony. According to Laub, delivering testimony is a delicate process in which the listener encourages the witness but at the same time is cautious to avoid pushing him or her to recount memories that may result in emotional collapse. Testimony, Laub maintains, enables individuals to organize traumatizing experiences that caused them emotional injury into words and memories, to process the pain, and to contend with the horror while sharing it and calling for historical justice. Twenty years after he began collecting testimonies, and ten years after formulating his approach to the role of the listener, Laub took the discourse of testimony one step further by interviewing Holocaust survivors who had been hospitalized in institutions for the mentally ill in Israel. In his eyes, their broken stories of emotional injury were the most distinctive testimony of the trauma they endured. Over the years, Laub worked with psychiatric and emotional trauma patients in psychiatric wards and in a private clinic. He wrote dozens of articles and chapters in books dealing with different aspects of trauma, testimony, and the Holocaust. Laub was the father of two children, and his second wife was Johanna Bodenstab (1961-2015), who was also a scholar of the Holocaust. He lived in Woodbridge, Connecticut in the northeastern United States, where he died at the age of 81.

It was designed by John McCrossin and built by Unknown. The property is owned by Uralla Historical Society Inc. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Mill was constructed between the late 1860s and early 1870s by John McCrossin. Equipped with a 16 horsepower engine, the mill operated three mill stones with a production capacity of around 1000 bushels a week. McCrossin built the mill in the expectation that the New England region would become a major exporter of flour to other parts of the Colony. Soon after the completion of the mill, however, flour prices began to fall. McCrossin could not compete with the two other mills already established in Uralla and the further four in Armidale, one in Inverell and one in Walcha. Drought and the importation of higher quality South Australian flour killed the New England wheat growing and, therefore, the milling business. South Australian flour was of a higher quality as the wheat ripened more evenly and thoroughly, allowing for the use of mechanical harvesters. Additionally, South Australian mills used steel rollers to mill the grain, producing a finer flour than the gritty product created by the mill stones employed by the New England millers. The Chaff Shed was probably constructed in response to falling trade. Unlike the Mill, it was constructed as cheaply as possible to diversify the services offered by the Mill. The mill apparently closed in the 1890s. Early in the 19th century the buildings were bought by a skin buyer. The Mill then passed into the hands of the Cooper family, who operated a hardware and undertaking business in it. During this period part of the mill was used by Mr Crossman, who was a tank maker. Also around this time the Mill's engine was removed to the Rocky River gold fields. About 1935 the McRae family purchased the Mill as a store for their grocery and produce business. Ken McRae buried the boiler outside the eastern wall of the mill in the early 1960s. Both the McRaes and Coopers used the well to dispose of rubbish so that it had been filled by 1960. The Uralla Historical Society bought the Mill in 1979 and began restorations, funded by the Heritage Council of NSW. Today the Mill is operated as a museum by the Society. Constructed next to John McCrossin's Flour Mill in 1881 as a chaff cutting shed, with power delivered by a wooden driveshaft through an aperture in the \\"western\\" wall of the mill.Mayo, 2002 *1940 - 1979 - used as storage by the McCrae's Hardware Shop, and known as the \\"Wireshed\\". *1979 - purchased by Uralla Historical Society. *1982-84 - squared and stabilised by the society.  Description  ;Mill Building A three storey brick structure facing onto Salisbury Street in a south-south-westerly direction. A verandah stretches the length of the building, sheltering a central double door. Two windows are evenly spaced on either side of the door, on the upper five windows are symmetrically aligned. The ground floor on the north, west and south walls is constructed of roughly dressed local white granite blocks, infilled with smaller pieces. The front facade is coursed in evener blocks. The upper storeys are of red brick. The outer walls and parts of the inner walls have been laid in English bond (a course of headers alternating with a course of stretchers). On the inside back wall of the first and second floors has been laid in what could be described as a crude form of Colonial bond. Colonial bond usually consists of three courses of stretchers followed by one course of headers. In this example up to five courses of stretchers have been laid between the intervening courses of headers. Colonial bond did not become popular in Sydney until the early 1880s (mill construction began in late 1860s). At the rear of the building there is a row of windows on the first floor. On the ground floor a series of windows and doors have been made into the original structure. In the south east corner of the eastern wall a door opens into the original engine room, which runs the width of the building. A door level with the first opens into the larger milling area. Halfway along the wall dividing the engine and milling rooms is a wall box, originally to transfer power between the two. Two flights of steep stairs, located towards Salisbury Street in the milling room, lead to the second and third floors. These floors are supported by a series of four brick piers dividing the front two thirds of the milling area from the rear. These piers extend up through the second and third floors to support the roof. The hipped roof was originally wooden shingles, which has subsequently been replaced with corrugated iron. Between the ground and first floors is a trap door and a series of small chutes to allow for the movement of grain and flour between the floors. ;Chaff Shed The Chaff Shed occupies approximately , between McCrossin's Mill 1870 and McCrossin's Stables/Store . The first floor and steeply pitched roof with its tapered rafters and shingle battens are supported by twenty one huge, round poles, approximately in diameter. Roof and walls are now corrugated iron. There is a loading bay on the first floor.  Condition  The mill's physical condition is fair; and the archaeological potential is low. Its position and basic condition (but not cosmetic condition), make it significant.  Modifications and dates  The following modifications have been made: *Windows were installed in the front wall. *1975Dovecot removed *1982-84Flooring on ground floor demolished; and rotted poles replaced or scarfed.  Heritage listing  McCrossins Mill is of State significance as representing the endeavours of early settlers to determine the agricultural pursuits best suited to various part of New South Wales. While wheat and flour production ultimately failed in the area, McCrossins Mill is a reminder of the trial and error approach to agriculture. McCrossins Mill is also representative of the speculation in industry driven by the gold rush, being built to supply that market. McCrossins Mill was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The McCrossin family were pioneers of commerce in Uralla: Flour milling, retailers, hoteliers etc. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The existence of such a formidable rural building in the village precinct is most unusual. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The chaff shed now has a very special association with the Uralla Historical Society. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The existence of such a formidable rural building in the village precinct is most unusual.

History  About 125,000 Don Cossacks, who formed sixty cavalry regiments, thirty-three horse batteries, six infantry battalions, five reserve regiments, three reserve batteries and more than eighty separate special hundreds took part in the battles of the First World War. They participated in almost every major operation at the Russian front. The upcoming anniversary of the beginning of the war has aroused public interest in Russia to commemorate the memory of its heroes. Work on the monument in Azov began in 2012. The sculpture was cast in February 2014. The monument itself is a figure of a standing Cossack and Saint George Cross, the symbol of military merits, behind him. In his right hand the Cossack holds a sword, and in the left one - a scabbard from a saber. The sad pose of the Cossack corresponds to the out of the First World War for Russia. The monument is set on a granite pedestal. It was designed by sculptor A. M. Dementiev. The height of the sculpture of the Cossack is two meters. The three-meter St. George cross is made of bronze and brass. Granite for the pedestal was brought from Karelia and Ukraine. The monument was erected at the donation of Azov dwellers.

Plot  Graham Marshall, the protagonist, is a rising executive at a London- based oil conglomerate, and has always played by the rules. But Graham is passed over for promotion, losing out to a younger colleague called Robert Benham. On his way home that night, he lashes out at an aged tramp who harasses him, killing him, and dumps the body in the Thames.

Biography   Early life  Reed Edwin Peggram was born to Harvey Thomas Peggram and Mary Reed Peggram on July 26, 1914 in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Both of his parents were born in Virginia. Peggram's mother was a housewife and his father, after an injury from military involvement during World War I, was sent to a hospital in Virginia for long term recovery. After his parents divorced, Peggram's mother married a man with the last name Farrar and moved to Bayonne, New Jersey. Because Peggram was not primarily supported by either of his parents, he was taken care of by his grandmother, Mrs. Laura Reed, who worked as a school custodian. Reed Peggram also had three younger brothers.Peggram, Reed. ‚ÄúIndividual Record Card.‚Äù TS.Peggram, Reed. ‚ÄúHarvard College, Harvard Engineering School: Application for Admission.‚Äù 5 July 1930.

During his time in school, he also enjoyed participating in track, Dramatic Club, and tutoring French and Latin. His main expertise was in scholastic endeavors, however, and Peggram managed to earn honors in many of his courses, including Elementary Latin, French, and German as well as Advanced Latin.Public Latin School: Record of the Class of 1931. He also received the Exemplary Conduct and Fidelity Award, Conduct Above Criticism Award, and Perfection in Attendance Award in school.Catalogue of the Public Latin School in Boston. Boston, J. B.

Even though Peggram was often limited financially, he received money from the Veterans Aid program throughout his childhood. Fortunately, his grandmother saved most of this money to fund Peggram's university education, allowing him to attend Harvard University from 1931 to 1935. While there, he studied French and graduated Magna cum laude with High Honors for his Bachelor of Arts in Romance Languages and Literature in the department of Romance Philology.Peggram, Reed. ‚ÄúHarvard University Faculty of Arts and Sciences: Application for a Fellowship or Scholarship in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences for the Academic Year 1937-1938.‚Äù 7 Jan. 1937.

Adult years  After studying together, Peggram and Hauptmann formed a strong relationship and wanted to leave to America together. Unfortunately, these plans were delayed first by financial limitations, as they both struggled to make money. Peggram was considered for teaching positions at Claflin University in Orangeburg, South Carolina and Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but he was unable to find the financial support to travel home.President Randolph.

Then, with the German occupation of Denmark during WWII, Peggram and Hauptmann had to flee to France and eventually settled in Italy.Peggram, Reed E. Received by William B. Pratt.

Print. During this time, Peggram had the chance to return to the United States, and Hauptmann was offered work under German occupation. Yet, both men denied these opportunities for freedom, as they were not willing to separate from one another. Thus, they were sentenced to death and claimed as prisoners. The pair spent two years in German and Italian concentration camps, during which military personnel confiscated their documentation papers. Eventually, both Peggram and Hauptmann escaped prison, facing harsh conditions and machine gun fire along their journey. The pair finally found safety with the 92nd Infantry Division in Italy. Unfortunately, because neither of them had their identification documents, Peggram and Hauptmann were still unable to return to the U.S. at this time. Moreover, their time in Nazi imprisonment left both men to suffer from nervous breakdowns and mental health problems. After his freedom, Peggram received four years of treatment for his mental health issues.Harvard College Class of 1935: Fifteenth Anniversary Report. Cambridge, The Cosmos Press, 1950. After seven years abroad, Peggram travelled back to the United States to work as a translator and a teacher. Living in his home town of Dorchester in Boston, Massachusetts, he spent his time working, expanding his language skills, and singing in Episcopal Church choirs.Harvard College Class of 1935: 40th Anniversary Report.

Death  Reed Edwin Peggram died on April 20, 1982 in Dorchester, Massachusetts at the age of 67. He was retired at the time of his death and survived by a brother, Vincent Farrar.  Career  Knowing seven languages, including English, French, German, Italian, and Danish, Peggram worked as a translator and later on as a teacher of linguistics. In 1950, he also expressed interest in obtaining a doctorat d'universit√© rather than a PhD. Throughout his lifetime, Peggram published several comparative literature and linguistic works.

The site was initially developed under the name Temple Green and is located with the M1 Motorway on its southern edge and the A63 road on its eastern edge. In July 2018, it was announced that the site had been selected as the location of the planned High Speed 2 phase 2 rolling stock maintenance depot. History The site is located on farmland and former industrial land with planning consent for over . It is next to the M1 Motorway and the A63, which is known as the East Leeds Link Road.The joint partnership is known as Aire Valley Land and owns of land in the area. The M1 link road to the A1(M) opened in 1999, but whilst junction 45 was completed on the motorway, no roads radiated from it until the A63 opened into Leeds ten years later. The site was originally known as Templegate and Temple Green when it was first developed in 2009, but has since been rebranded as Gateway 45. Initially, it was intended to straddle both sides of the motorway and include Skelton Lake, but the south side of the development was given permission in 2017 to open as a motorway service area, and the original plan for 1,800 houses has not featured in documents since 2015. In 2016, Harworth Group acquired a 50% stake in the venture which was previously held by other investment companies; as of 2018, the site is co-owned by Harworth and the Evans Property Group. Park & Ride Phase One on the site opened in June 2017 and has 1,000 car parking spaces for a park and ride facility into Leeds city centre. Low emission buses run every ten to fifteen minutes from the site along the A63. The first phase totalled ¬£9.1 million and involved the building of an extra of dual carriageway. In March 2019, a further was bought to enable the Park & Ride scheme to expand. HS2 depot In July 2018, it was announced that a rolling stock facility for the proposed HS2 line would be located in Leeds in the Gateway 45 area. A depot was originally proposed in New Crofton (in nearby Wakefield) but the preferred option was at Leeds as the empty trains would have a shorter distance to travel and would therefore have a lesser environmental impact. The developers of Leeds Gateway, Evans Property Group and Harworth Group, suggested that the depot could be sited on land occupied by the former Skelton Grange power station. The depot was originally estimated to be over which would remove a significant chunk of the proper development. A year later, the Secretary of State for Transport confirmed that the maintenance facility would be located at Gateway 45. The facility is expected to create 125 skilled jobs for 24-hour maintenance of trains using HS2. The sidings will be long enough to accommodate thirty-eight trains for HS2, although four other trains will be stabled in York for operational purposes. IHSRSI In June 2019, it was announced that the University of Leeds' venture to create a Institute for High Speed Rail and System Integration (IHSRSI) would be built on land adjacent to the future HS2 depot. The University of Leeds and railway industry partners would contribute ¬£40 million, the Leeds City Region Local Enterprise Partnership Growth Deal would add ¬£13 million, and the UK Government would contribute ¬£11 million. The institute would have three key areas of research on track, vehicles and signalling at up to ; \\"a testing facility for railway vehicle performance under simulated conditions, a facility to test the forces on track, ballast and support structures, and a System Integration and Innovation Centre to allow investigations to be conducted into digital signalling, power systems and electro-magnetic interference.\\" Notes References External links *Official website Category:Economy of Leeds Category:Park and ride schemes in the United Kingdom Category:Transport in West Yorkshire Category:High Speed 2 ","title":"Gateway 45"},{"id":"57826303","text":"The 1983 San Marino motorcycle Grand Prix was the final race of the 1983 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season.

The SiH molecule is a radical, and can be made experimentally by striking an electric arc to silicon on a low pressure hydrogen gas. Surface As a surface layer, silicon hydrides form when the silicon is cleaned with hydrofluoric acid. This surface hydrogen SiH decomposes when heated to 750 K. Other ways to coat a silicon surface in hydrogen is via reaction aith atomic hydrogen, or hot silane. A (111) crystal face will become covered in the pure monohydride, but other faces on a silicon crystal will also have the dihydride and trihydride groups. Group The silylidene group, not to be confused with silylidene, is a ‚â°SiH group that is bonded with a triple bond. The hydrogen can be substituted by other groups to make a more generic family of silylidynes. It is known as a ligand on molybdenum. Natural occurrence Silicon monohydride in space was first noticed in sun spots in 1933. Later on it was found on the solar disk, photosphere, and in cool stars. Mira variable stars of type M or S may have emission lines of SiH. In even cooler brown dwarfs and planets, SiH is not found, but instead silicon takes form as silicon monoxide at low pressures, and SiH4 at high pressures. Minute amounts of SiH as a transient species may be found in these bodies as SiO and SiH4 react with water. Properties The Si-H bond strength is 80 kcal/mol. Spectrum The most prominent spectral band is due to A2Œî ‚Üí X2Œ† transitions. Higher level excited states are the B2Œ£‚àí and C2Œ£+, D2Œî, E2Œ£+. The life time of the molecules in the A state is 530 nanoseconds. They decay to the X ground state.

The first dates to 1751 and is now in the Wallraf‚ÄìRichartz Museum in Cologne, whilst the second was produced in 1752 and is now in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich. The model may be Marie-Louise O'Murphy,http://rijksmuseumamsterdam.blogspot.com/2012/03/francois-boucher- blonde-odalisque-1752.html mistress of Louis XV for two years. They belong to the odalisque genre. Analysis Boucher's The Blonde Odalisque, or Resting Girl, is filled with soft and flirtatious pastel colors such as pinks, yellows, and blues. The profusion of flowery tones boldly embodies the Rococo era. The nude girl and suggestive symbols throughout the painting help convey this erotic theme that Rococo painters love using. The different shades of yellow throughout the piece create a serene tone that accentuates the girl's pinkish nude body. The nude girl is the main center point of the painting and our eyes are drawn there by the horizontal lines shown in her pose and in the way the drapes hang down the side of the room. The sheet and cushion surround her elegantly and make her look very light and airy. There are certain things placed throughout the painting that create a sense of wonder or confusion. The open book that seems to be abandoned, the lone rose left on the floor, and even her expression can be interpreted a few different ways. She could either be surprised or anxious. Maybe someone is entering the room that she wasn't expecting, or she could be waiting anxiously for someone to arrive. The woman seen in the painting is a mistress of Louis XV, Marie-Louise O‚ÄôMurphy. This information could also add to her expression of anxiety, as a mistress she could have been waiting for someone to come and be with her. The sexuality of the painting does imply that she is a mistress of some kind, the colors and her pose are very suggestive to something sensual. Background Intimacy and delicacy are common themes found in Boucher's work. Venus Consoling Love, and The Triumph of Venus are some of Boucher's other works that convey these themes. Both pieces show how Boucher's work progressed and helped pave the way to creating The Blonde Odalisque. His painting style is also something he's famous for, the soft and delicate, yet bold brush strokes are representative of common Rococo themes such as delicacy and beauty. The Blonde Odalisque has two somewhat different copies, the first one was made in 1751 and is now in Cologne, Germany. The Cologne version shows the girl resting with a book by her side and a fallen rose in the bottom middle of the painting. The later version of the painting was made in 1752 and is located in Munich, Germany. This version has a small golden box with a lion on the top in place of where the book was in the original version. This piece also has a different flower on the floor in a completely different location. The flower is tucked under the bed and is off to the left. The pillows on the floor in the Munich version are much lighter and easier to look at. The Cologne version with the book has a shadow cast over the pillows and some of the book. The two paintings are clearly very different but the slight changes that were made can be easily overlooked. Boucher and Marie- Louise O'Murphy met through their affiliation with the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture in Paris, which is also known as The Academy of Painting. Boucher was the principal painter at the academy when he met Marie and chose her to be his chief model. Boucher claimed to have relied on Marie's looks for inspiration for his future paintings. Marie quickly succeeded as a model at The Academy of Painting and was eventually recognized by King Louis XV and became his youngest mistress. Inspiration Boucher's early work consisted of printmaking and illustrating books. He grew up in Paris and was surrounded by the most influential and talented artists of his time. Around the age of 23, Boucher was employed to make etchings after the drawings of Antoine Watteau, this connection helped shape his art style which later led him to paint The Blonde Odalisque. When The Blonde Odalisque was painted in 1751, it was clear that Boucher had been fully influenced by the Rococo movement. Marie-Louise O'Murphy The woman seen in the painting is Marie-Louise O'Murphy, an Irish woman who was also known as Louison. She was born in 1737 and at the age of 14 became the youngest mistress to King Louis XV; she was still only 14 years old when she modelled for this painting. After the painting was commissioned by the French court of the Ancien R√©gime, The King was so intrigued by the painting that he summoned her for himself. She stayed with The king for two years before she was seen as a threat to The King's other mistresses and was caught asking the King personal questions. She was later asked to leave the Parc-aux-Cerfs, which was what Louis XV's secret brothel was called. Madame De Pompadour, Louis XV's most famous mistress, would regularly dismiss young mistresses for trying to get closer to Louis XV, these accusations are often overlooked.

It sees itself as an information platform in the field of sadomasochism, is recognized as charitable and benevolent, and has been since the beginning of 2005 a member of the German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research and officially registered as a lobbying organization at the German Bundestag. The organization was founded on May 31, 2003 in Cologne by about 40 BDSM group representatives and individuals. As of August 2011, the Federal Association had about 400 members - including 60 groups and clubs.  Goals  The aim of the BVSM is to contribute as a platform for better coordination of activities in the BDSM scene and to act as a larger association effective for the interests of sadomasochists in Germany. The organization sees its priority area of work in the networking and active support of groups and initiatives, and continues to establish contacts with other organizations at a supra- regional level. In the long term, it believes that similarly emancipated living conditions should be created for BDSMers in Germany or in the entire Central European area, as they already exist in part for homosexuals today. Monday, 29 July 2019 Another goal is to build bridges between the different groups, currents and varieties of sadomasochism, to promote sadomasochists as part of cultural and political diversity in Germany and to promote their acceptance by the population. The BVSM addresses internal and external target groups and conducts information and education on sadomasochism by providing information material tailored to the respective target group. The information for BDSM members includes in particular practical tips as well as safety instructions, while towards the general public promotion of acceptance and the dismantling of fears and reservations are in the foreground. The third major task of the organization is advocacy and lobbying, in which the BVSM makes itself available to the public as a competent point of contact.  Organization  The BVSM sees itself as a network platform that supports and promotes the formation of supraregional structures and the work of expert working groups on specialist topics. There are committees on various topics, and in its function as an organization office, the BVSM coordinates the cross- regional networking of regional resources and supraregional events such as the BDSM Congress.

Students and staff from Elim Christian College were at the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Centre during a gorge trip. The flash flood resulted in the death of six students and one teacher. It took place at the Mangatepopo stream in the Tongariro National Park. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"stream of rotten items\\" for Mangatepopo. Summary On April 15, 2008 approximately 40 students were on a school camp at the Sir Edmund Hillary Outdoor Pursuits Center. The group was from Elim Christian College in Auckland. Ten students, one teacher, and one instructor were on the river when the water level began to rise rapidly due to a thunderstorm. The group took shelter on a ledge. After some time, the instructor, believing that the water level would continue to rise, made the decision to leave the ledge as she feared that the students would be at risk of hypothermia if they stayed there. The plan was for the instructor, Jodie Sullivan, to go first with Ashley Smith and then throw a line to the students as they came down at five-minute intervals. Sullivan and Smith both made it safely to the bank of the left of the river. No one left on the ledge had a watch, which made the timings much more difficult. Kish Proctor went first, and either did not catch the rope or lost his hold on it and went over the dam, but he was later rescued. Peter Shiih caught the rope and made it to safety. Portia McPhail, Natasha Bray and Tara Gregory were unable to catch the rope, went over the dam and drowned. Floyd Fernandes and Anthony Mulder were attached to each other and neither were able to reach the rope; it is assumed that they were too far away from Sullivan and both drowned. Sarah Brooks was unable to catch the rope, went over the dam and survived. Antony McClean, the teacher, attached himself to student Tom Hsu. Antony was initially able to catch the rope, but later lost hold of it and both drowned. The current proved too strong for most of the group. A total of six students and one teacher died in the event, An in-depth investigation found significant failings at the center that led to the disaster. Consequently, the center was fined $480,000 for health and safety breaches. The flash flood had one of the highest death tolls on a school camp in a western country in recent history. The principal of the college, Murray Burton, was awarded a member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for the way he led his community through the disaster. Dramatization The events of the disaster were documented in the 2018 made-for-TV movie In a Flash. Inquiry findings The Center's Report lists almost 200 recommendations and lessons learned from the disaster. Findings from the inquiry suggest that if any one of the following failings had been addressed, the disaster would not have happened: *The weather warning left out the critical word \\"thunderstorms.\\" *If the group had stayed on the ledge, the water would have receded after 30‚Äì60 minutes. *High staff turnover at the Center led to poor record keeping and awareness of earlier safety incidents, including one fatality, over the past forty years. *In 1977 an instructor was killed in the gorge. It appears that Jodie Sullivan was not aware of this. *Two instructors should have been present for the trip up the gorge. *Tom Hsu had cerebral palsy. This was not disclosed on the medical form, although Sullivan was aware of it. *Imprecise communications between Sullivan and the center lead to confusion about whether the group had gone into the gorge or not. *The disaster could have been averted if both the teacher and the instructor each had a radio so they could communicate. *Inaccurate or incomplete permission slips did not fully disclose the students' swimming ability. *The students were told to leave their cell phones at the campsite, which limited their ability to call for help. *Overconfidence of the instructor was a factor which led to the deaths associated with the event. *The center did not have an up to date weather report. *Although the activities were listed as a challenge by choice, there was no alternative activity for the students who did not want to participate. *The center had a reputation for activities in ‚Äúrain or shine‚Äù which significantly increased the risk and made cancelling an activity harder.

The grave comprises a marble headstone, designed by Mr Callcott, and built in 1914. It is also known as Uralla Old General Cemetery. It is one of a group of historic sites labelled The Captain Thunderbolt Sites for their association with bushranger Captain Thunderbolt, along with Captain Thunderbolt's Rock, Blanch's Royal Oak Inn, and Captain Thunderbolt's Death Site. Collectively, all properties were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 July 2012.  History  Uralla Cemetery was established in the 1850s and used until the 1930s.http://us.sydney.com/town/Uralla/Pioneer_Cemetery_Uralla/info.aspx The cemetery contains the graves of many local notable families including the Blanch's. After the magisterial inquiry held at Blanch's Inn, Captain Thunderbolt's body was moved to Uralla and he remained unburied for a number of days. On 29 May 1870 his body was identified by William Monckton who had ridden with Thunderbolt some years earlier.The Empire. 1 June 1870. That afternoon it was taken to be buried in an unmarked grave at Uralla cemetery. In 1914 a gravestone was erected by local residents, the majority of the costs being born by a Mr L. A. Crap.  Description  The marble headstone has the following inscription: Erected by NEW ENGLAND RESIDENTS TO MARK WHERE LIES THUNDERBOLT [FRED WARD] CALLCOTT ARMIDALE DIED MAY 25. 1870, AGED 36 YEARS The headstone and grave is surrounded by a picket fence. The grave is located at the southern boundary of the Uralla Cemetery; the location of the grave is signposted.  Condition  As at 10 April 2012, the condition was assessed as fair. The picket fencing was new but the gravestone shows signs of spalling and some of the makers information is difficult to discern.  Modifications and dates  The picket fencing was installed in 2011.  Heritage listing  Captain Thunderbolt's Grave was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 July 2012 having satisfied the following criteria.

It and its pair The Setting of the Sun were both private commissions for Madame de Pompadour as full-scale models for the Gobelins Manufactory. The tapestries produced from the paintings were completed in 1754-1755 and hung in the king's bedroom at ch√¢teau de Bellevue. They were sold together with the rest of her collection on 28 April 1766 and passed through four other collections before being bought on 2 August 1855 by Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford. Like the rest of his collection, they now hang in the Wallace Collection in London. Description Often described as Boucher's most ambitious and successful mythological works, this work was not intended to be displayed as paintings, but was to be hung in the bedroom of King Louis XV's country chateau. Representing the rhythm of the day, Boucher creates an integrated pairing layered with allegory and symbolism. In The Rising of the Sun, the god Apollo ascends into the sky with arms outstretched, chasing away the nocturnal darkness. Turquoise and azure blues announce the clarity of the day, the strong light of the morning brought into relief in the shadows cast upon the sculptural body of the young god of the sun. The foregrounds of the canvas is populated by the nude bodies of nymphs and naiads, overlapping with one another to create a series of arabesque curves that are echoed in the forms of the waves. The meeting of sky and sea affirms the mythological setting of Boucher's painting. Some art historians have interpreted the depiction of Thetis, the nymph who appears in The Rising of the Sun as a tribute to her; Thetis, who holds the reins of Apollo's horses, was said to aid the god in his voyage across the sky, and Madame de Pompadour had recently taken a more active role as a political advisor in the King's court. These mythological scenes of harmonious pastels, beautiful nude bodies and gauzy textures exemplify the visual elegance of the Rococo aesthetic; their decorative nature is further enhanced by their function as designs for tapestries, which would have served to adorn and complement a luxurious and fashionable home.https://www.m.theartstory.org/artist-boucher-francois- artworks.htm References category:1752 paintings category:Paintings by Fran√ßois Boucher Category:Paintings of the Wallace Collection Category:Bathing in art ","title":"The Rising of the Sun"},{"id":"57826620","text":"Methylpentene is an alkene with a molecular formula C6H12.

Career 2015-2016 seasons Wood began speedway racing in 2015, signing for Eastbourne Eagles as one of their reserves after the team dropped down to the National League that season. During the season, he increased his average from the starting 3.00 to 5.90 and, after sitting August out with ligament damage to his knee, moved out of the reserve position to ride at number 2. Riding at number 2, he scored his first paid-maximum from 4 rides by scoring 11+1 on 12 September in a National Trophy fixture against Mildenhall Fen Tigers. Wood helped the Eagles win a National League treble, with the team winning the Knockout Cup, Gold Cup and National Trophy. Following his successful first season, on 17 November 2015, it was confirmed that Wood would ride again for Eastbourne in the 2016 season. He had another good season, this time increasing his average to 7.62, spending most of the season riding as a heat-leader at number 3 or 4. Wood again won the Knockout Cup, with the Eagles defeating Birmingham Brummies in the final. 2017 season =Eastbourne= Wood signed for Eastbourne for the third season in a row on 17 November 2016, and he was also named team captain for the 2017 season. In July, Wood made it to the top of the Eastbourne's averages, meaning that he would ride at number 1 for the first time. He lost his place at number 1 to Jake Knight at the end of the month. He scored his first full maximum, getting 18 points from 6 rides, in the National League play-off semi-final against Kent Kings. Wood finished the season with an average of 7.61, a slight decrease to his starting average. This was a consequence of having acquired the much trickier position of number 5 for most of the season. He also helped Eastbourne win the Knockout Cup for the third successive season; this time, the Eagles beat Mildenhall Fen Tigers in the final. =Sheffield= Due to his impressive start to the season with Eastbourne, on 19 July, Sheffield Tigers signed Wood as a replacement for the injured Nathan Stoneman at reserve, with a starting average of 2.00. Wood finished the season with an average of 2.31, and Sheffield won the SGB Championship by beating Ipswich Witches in the play-off final. In heat 7 of the promotion/relegation meeting against Leicester Lions, Georgie Wood beat former British Speedway Champion Danny King. 2018 season =Eastbourne= On 21 December 2017, it was announced that Wood would ride for Eastbourne for the fourth successive season in the National League. Wood started in the number 5 position, but he regained the number 1 race jacket following the release of the first new set of averages. Wood lost the number 1 position to Tom Brennan for the month of July, but retook it in September; he stayed in it for the remainder of the season. For the fourth consecutive season, Wood won the Knockout Cup, with Eastbourne defeating Mildenhall Fen Tigers in the final. He also helped Eastbourne win their first league title in 18 years by winning the National League Play-Off Final against Mildenhall Fen Tigers. =Sheffield= Wood didn't start the season in the Sheffield septet; however, the Tigers had a poor start to the season and with Wood on top form for Eastbourne, Sheffield decided to make team changes. This saw Wood and Broc Nicol come into the side, on 20 June, to replace Jack Smith and Jan Graversen respectively. Wood gave up his Championship place on 27 July to focus on his racing with Eastbourne; he was replaced in the Sheffield side by Joe Lawlor. 2019 season =Eastbourne= Wood joined Eastbourne again for a fifth season in a row, and he continued with them in their move up to the SGB Championship. According to the Championship average declarations on 2 August, 2019, Wood‚Äôs average was 3.78. In late August 2019, according to Eastbourne Eagles and SpeedwayGB, Georgie Wood had been banned from racing in the leagues for 28 days because he had not been riding in certain speedway matches. His failure to ride in these matches was, in turn, due to medical problems. =Isle of Wight= With Eastbourne going into the Championship, Wood needed to find a new National League club. It was announced on 16 December 2018 that he had signed for the Isle of Wight Warriors. National League average declarations on 2 August, 2019 gave him a 9.6 average. 2020 season = Eastbourne = Georgie Wood is not on Eastbourne's team for the 2020 season.

An investigation revealed that the Antonov's right wing failed structurally during approach to Luhansk International Airport. Accident Flight 1969 was a scheduled domestic flight from Kurumoch to Luhansk. At 11:13 local time the An-10 departed Kurumoch International Airport and climbed to a cruising altitude of 7,800 meters. After passing a waypoint at Rostov the crew was instructed by air traffic control (ATC) to descend to an altitude of 5,700 meters. Shortly afterwards the crew received a report of weather conditions at the destination airport: solid clouds with a base of 600 meters, visibility 10 km, wind 50 degrees at eight meters per second with gusts up to 12 meters per second. At 12:58:46 the crew reported an altitude of 1,200 meters and were given permission to continue their descent to 600 meters. The crew's last transmission was at 12:58:50 when they reported they were continuing to descend. Before the An-10 reached 600 meters, approximately 13 square meters of the right wing including an aileron, separated from the rest of the aircraft severing hydraulic lines during the process. Part of the detached wing section struck the right horizontal stabilizer, damaging its structure while tearing off part of it and its elevator. The aircraft immediately yawed right and entered a steep bank also to the right. As the Antonov plummeted towards the ground both right engines lost oil pressure, causing their propellers to go into fine pitch, inducing both of them to rotate at very high rpm. At 12:59:30 the aircraft struck the ground in a 60 degree pitch down, 50 degree bank right attitude, killing all 65 people on board. Aircraft The Antonov An-10 involved was serial number 8400701 and registered as CCCP-11145 to Aeroflot. The construction of the airliner was completed on 31 December 1958 and it had sustained a total of 14,337 flight hours and 9,081 takeoff and landing cycles at the time of the crash. Investigation Investigators discovered that a riveted seam of the right wing nine ribs wide had separated in flight due to excessive shear loads. The investigators focused on two scenarios that could have led to the accident. The first was that the wing fractured due to over pressurization. It was theorized that if the vent outlet of the air bleed anti ice system were blocked by ice build up, too much pressure could cause a riveted seam to split open. Static testing with partially and completely blocked outlets showed that the pressure build up was negligible, due mostly to the systems design having numerous other paths for the bleed air to escape. The second synopsis was based on weakness of the joint due to a defect and/or fatigue cracks near the riveted seam. Testing of similar structures under laboratory conditions were performed but no weakening of the wing panel was found. Investigators failed to find the root cause of the wing panel failure and an official cause of the accident was never established.

Long-distance trains have not stop at Pavlovsk station. The station is approximately 1,4 km from the town center. It has official status as an object of Russian cultural heritage.  History  Pavlovsk station was opened on 23 May 1838 with the construction of the first in Russian Empire Tsarskoye Selo Railway from Saint-Petersburg to Pavlovsk.Pushkin, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica on-line–ü—É—à–∫–∏–Ω (–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥ –≤ –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–±–ª.), Great Soviet Encyclopedia on-line (in Russian) Construction began in May 1836, and the first test trips were carried out the same year between Tsarskoye Selo and Pavlovsk, using horse-drawn trains. The first station building was built according to the project of Italian architect Andrei Stackenschneider. Pavlovsk was terminal station for the Tsarskoye Selo Railway. To attract passengers Franz von Gerstner proposed to equip a music hall at the Pavlovsk station. The station and music hall worked only in the summer, because of the low passenger traffic for the winter. The Tsarskoye Selo railway was closed for the winter. Pavlovsk railway station was one of the first permanent music venue in Russia, in which symphony orchestras performed. In September 1838, Gypsy chorus performed, then the symphony orchestra conducted by Joseph German performed in early next year, and from 1856 Johann Strauss II performed for ten seasons. The outstanding musicians Alexander Glazunov, Reinhold Gli√®re, A. K. Lyadov, N. A. Malko, V. I. Suk, Leonid Sobinov, Nikilai Figner, Medea Figner, Ivan Yershov, Anastasia Vyaltseva, Henryk Wieniawski, Sergei Prokofiev and others performed at Pavlovsk music hall. In 1844 the building suffered a fire, but was restored soon. From 1860 to 1884 the station was rebuilt three times and expanded. In 1898 Pavlovsk railway station has become part of the private Moscow-Vindava- Rybinsk railway. The station building was destroyed during the Second world war. The current station building was built 60 meters north of the old building in 1955. It was designed by the architect Evgeny Levinson, who revived the palace and park ensembles of Pushkin and Pavlovsk. This is a one- story building with side porticos and a hexagonal rotunda with a spire in the central part. Earlier, until 1994, it was crowned by a star, but because of its dilapidation it was dismantled.

The film is based on the real-life story of Lu Yong (ÈôÜÂãá), a Chinese leukemia patient who smuggled cheap but unproven cancer medicine from India for 1,000 Chinese cancer sufferers in 2004. Dying to Survive stars Xu Zheng in the lead role, who also co-produced the film with Ning Hao. Plot An aphrodisiac peddler, Cheng Yong, is in financial trouble. His store has not been making profits for a long time and his father urgently needs a large sum of money for brain surgery. One day a man wearing thick layers of surgical masks comes to his shop. He asks Cheng to bring a cheap drug from India in return for a large sum of money. Due to patent protection, the Swiss drug Imatinib is very expensive and cannot be afforded by most leukemia patients in China. However, a special inexpensive generic version of it is available in India. Desperate for money, Cheng agrees to risk smuggling the drug into China. As more chronic myelogenous leukemia patients start to buy drugs from him, Cheng becomes rich. His motivation started to change after he witnessed devastated patients whose family has been pushed into poverty by costly cancer treatments, walk away with hope for the future. At the same time, Chinese police notice the availability of the contraband Geliening and vow to crack down on the unlicensed generic drug, as the originator company Novartis sued the Indian government for infringing its patent.

Critical reception Pang-Chieh Ho of SupChina wrote that Dying to Survive \\"might be China's best movie of the year\\". She compared the film's social realist themes to Hollywood film Dallas Buyers Club, Indian film Dangal, and Chinese film Angels Wear White. Though Simon Abrams of RogerEbert.com also compared the film to Dallas Buyers Club, he gave Dying to Survive two out of four stars, criticizing the excessive focus on Cheng to the detriment of the film's message and at the expense of other characters. He stated that \\"I‚Äôd have an easier time accepting the trite, asked-and-answered conclusions... if [the director and co-writers] were more adept at tugging at viewers' heart-strings.\\" Impact The film sparked debate about the cost of healthcare in China. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang cited the film in an appeal to regulators to \\"speed up price cuts for cancer drugs\\" and \\"reduce the burden on families\\". Accolades {  - ! Award ! Category !

It was developed under the Philippine Scientific Earth Observation Microsatellite program (PHL-Microsat) and was jointly implemented by the University of the Philippines and the Department of Science and Technology as part of the Kyushu Institute of Technology-led multinational second Joint Global Multi-nations Birds Satellite (Birds-2). Maya-1 is the first nanosatellite of the Philippines.  Background  Following the launch of the Diwata-1 microsatellite in 2016, the Philippine Department of Science and Technology (DOST) announced on 29 June 2017 that two satellites, one nanosatellite and one microsatellite, will be launched in 2018. The government agency said that Filipino graduate students, Joven Javier and Adrian Salces attending Kyushu Institute of Technology (KIT), Japan were working on developing a satellite with their mentors which at that time was still to be named. The satellite, later dubbed as Maya-1, was developed mainly through the second Joint Global Multination Birds Satellite (Birds-2) initiated by the Kyushu Institute of Technology (KIT) in Japan. The project is managed by a team composed of 11 graduate students from Bhutan, Japan, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The two other satellites developed under Birds-2; BHUTAN-1 of Bhutan and UiTMSAT-1 of Malaysia. The first iteration of the project (Birds-1) was a joint effort by Bangladesh, Ghana, Japan, Mongolia, and Nigeria. The project was also placed under the Philippine Scientific Earth Observation Microsatellite program. The PHL-Microsat team suggested the name of the satellite which is Maya (bird) (a local term for a bird) in the Philippines.  Development  The Birds-2 project commenced in November 2016. Maya-1 was designed by PHL-Microsat scholars and KIT graduate students Joven Javier and Adrian Salces. Javier is pursuing a master's degree while Salces is pursuing a doctorate degree. Javier, who is also the overall project manager of Birds-2, served as the Electronics PCB Designer of Maya-1 while Salces was responsible for developing the satellite's Ground Station Segment and Communication Subsystem. The satellite which is classified as a 1U CubeSat. It measures 10 √ó 10 √ó 11.35 cm and weighs . Maya-1 took fifteen months to build.  Instruments  Maya-1 was built using components which are commercially available which was determined safe to use in space. The satellite, along with BHUTAN-1 and UiTMSAT-1, is equipped with Automatic Packet Reporting System digipeater. This equipment is used to demonstrate communication relay capabilities of the three satellites. Maya-1 is also equipped with a Global Positioning System chip and a magnetometer, the latter to be used in measuring magnetic fields in space.  Launch and mission  Birds-2 in the JEM Small Satellite Orbital Deployer. Birds-2 satellites deployed from the Kib≈ç module. Maya-1 was launched to space on 29 June 2018, via the Falcon 9 Full Thrust rocket at Cape Canaveral in Florida, United States as part of the SpaceX CRS-15 Commercial Resupply Service mission. BHUTAN-1 and UiTMSAT-1 which were also developed under the Birds-2 project was also among the payload of the rocket. Maya-1, along with the two other satellites were deployed from the International Space Station (ISS) on 10 August 2018 through the Japanese Kib≈ç module on the ISS. It orbits approximately the same altitude of the ISS at about . A few days after its deployment, amateur ground stations from ten participating nations of the Birds project will confirmed communication with the three satellites. While built solely by Filipinos, the satellite will be jointly controlled and operated by the Philippines, Bhutan, and Malaysia. The combined cost to build and launch Maya-1 is around US$150,000 (). The mission of Maya-1 is for \\"experimentally testing of commercial apparatus\\" and due to its size, \\"a cost- effective educational platform\\" to help Filipinos build future satellites. The satellite could also be used to relay messages in the event typhoons render cellular services unavailable. The satellite will be operational from about six to 9 months.

It was designed by Sydney Smith of Ogg & Serpell and built from in 1934 by R. M. Bowcock. It is also known as Church of Christ the King. The property is owned by the Archdiocese of Canberra ‚Äì Goulburn and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 30 April 2004.  History  The Church of Christ the King was designed by Sydney Smith of Ogg & Serpell, 349 Collins Street, Melbourne on 17 January 1933. The architectural drawings were completed by Clement Glancey, Bligh Street, Sydney. The church was constructed by R. M. Bowcock, Ashfield Sydney in 1934. The church was completed and furnished in six months.  Description  The Church of Christ the King is a red brick Inter-War-Romanesque structure approximately long and by wide. The nave consists of six bays with a large sanctuary at the east and an entry narthex and choir loft at the west of the church. As a result, the church has a strictly correct liturgically geographical alignment and the sun rises directly through the sanctuary windows and sets directly through the Great West Window. The church is the most prominent building in Taralga and can be observed throughout the towns and its environs. ;Exterior The Romanesque style of the building is established by the asymmetrical massing and use of red brick to create homogeneous heavily textured exterior walls. There are 31 round-headed arched window openings. The western end gable is finished with a raking arches motif. Above the western portico is an impressive sandstone circular or wheel window with sixteen outer surrounding semi-circles, sixteen spoked segments and a circular hub. The architectural elements around the wheel window, the spiral pillars, the semi-circular arches, the sandstone carved oak leaf motifs, are reiterated harmoniously in the front porch beneath the window. ;Interior The interior of the church contains extensive and sometime elaborate plaster work. Each bay has a corded plaster decoration around the full curve of the barrel vaulted ceiling, while Corinthian style capitals are prominent on the pillars and pilasters. Above the sanctuary, there is an impressive life-size Calvary, depicting the Scene \\"Woman, behold thy son; son behold thy mother\\", with the Blessed Virgin and the young and beardless Saint John flanking the Crucified. The sanctuary is generously decked with beautiful cream marble in the alter, elaborate reredo and pulpit - all generously decked with very fine brasswork in massive candlesticks, crucifix, sanctuary lamp, lecterns and votive candle stands. The free- standing Post-Vatican II altar was introduced without structural alteration of the sanctuary and tastefully matches the original high altar. The altar is flanked with magnificent dioramas of the period depicting Our Lord's apparition revealing the Sacred Heart to St Margaret Mary, and Our Lady's apparition revealing the Immaculate Conception to St Bernadette. Side altars are dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes and St Joseph. There are shrines of St Therese of Lisieux and St Francis Xavier, the two patrons of Australia as a then \\"mission country\\". Original votive lamps are in place. The original altar rails are preserved in situ. ;Windows The church windows consist of six stained glass, seven leadlight and approximately twenty mid-amber yellow double-rolled cathedral glass windows. The leadlight windows were commissioned and installed before the emergence of \\"modern\\" tastes, the first four by Percy Barnard of Standard Glass Company, Sydney and the last two by Mark B Hill and D terry. This set of six windows all share a very strong common background, colours and style. They capture very well the hagiography of the period and in details locate the work in the religious culture of the period and the place. For example, St Patrick's crozier is planted in Ireland, while the nearby Christ the King window has our Lord standing upon Australia. The Solemnity of Christ the King was but newly proclaimed when the church as erected, St Therese of Lisieux not long canonised and her doctrine flourishing (as but recently manifest in her elevation to the title of Doctor of the Church), St Maria Goretti recently canonised and capturing the period of plentiful vocations to sacred virginity, and Pope Pius X but recently canonised and his doctrine of frequent reception of the Holy Eucharist suffusing the interior of the church and its present and unbroken heritage of Catholic spirituality. The glass communicates a great sense of congruence with the entire structure and gives it much brilliance and light. The church contains a collection of significant moveable objects that are included in the State Heritage Register listing. A complete list is held with the NSW Heritage Office.  Condition  As at 26 June 2003, physical condition is excellent. The integrity of the structure is uncompromised.

From only individual Jews settling in the city to the waves of Jewish migration in the 1840s, during the American Civil War, and in the late 19th century to the early 20th century and beyond, the community has steadily grown. As it has gained in numbers, it has also built up numerous communal institutions, including some of the oldest remaining synagogues in the United States, and has a legacy of pulling together in times of war and crisis for both the nation and the Jewish world at large. Today, the Greater Washington community is the third largest in the United States, and remains active and influential in American politics and the broader Jewish world.  Early history  The first known Jewish resident of Washington D.C. is Isaac Polock, who arrived in 1795 and completed the building of the brick mansions known as the Six Buildings, located at 1st Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, west of the White House. The buildings once housed the United States Department of State and Secretary of the Navy, and later served as the homes of Secretaries of State James Madison and William H. Seward, as well as General Sam Houston. Major Alfred Mordecai, raised in an Orthodox household in North Carolina, was a West Point graduate who settled in D.C. in 1828 after being assigned to the Washington Arsenal. His daughter, Rosa, was born in 1839 and is the first known Jew to be born in the District. More Jewish families began to settle in the District in the 1840s, largely German Jewish immigrants, many of whom had connections to the Baltimore Jewish community. In 1852, the Washington Hebrew Congregation was established by 21 newly arrived Jews. While serving as president of the congregation, Captain Jonas Phillips Levy helped to lobby Congress to enshrine the congregation's right to own property in the District into law, resulting in the passage of \\"An Act for the Benefit of the Hebrew Congregation in the City of Washington\\" which was signed by President Franklin Pierce in 1856. It remains the only congregation with its own Congressional charter. The congregation was also responsible for opening the first Jewish school in the District. When the Civil War broke out, Washington D.C. was a heart of the conflict as the Union capital, sandwiched by two slave states, and right across the river from Confederate Alexandria, Virginia. The war transformed the city, and its entire population skyrocketed, including the Jewish population which grew times ten during the war, from 200 to 2,000. Six new kosher restaurants were opened, some of the 450 restaurants operating in the city during the war. The Washington Hebrew Congregation cared for injured Jewish soldiers during the war, and buried the bodies of unclaimed Jews. A corp of women in the congregation also helped to raise funds for the U.S Sanitary commission. In 1864, B'nai B'rith opened a lodge with 28 members upon opening. In 1869, upset by liturgical changes and the installation of an organ-like instrument, a group of members left Washington Hebrew to found their own congregation, Adas Israel. When the synagogue's construction was completed in 1876, President Ulysses S. Grant attended its dedication. Adas Israel Synagogue as it was being moved from its original location in 1969 Many of those who arrived in D.C. during wartime had decided to stay, and by 1880, the Jewish population was roughly 1,500. Seventh Street Northwest, an important business district, had a particularly high concentration of Jewish residents. There were also significant Jewish populations in the Southwest and Georgetown areas, and they began establishing their own organizations and congregations. The wave of Jewish migration from diaspora communities in Eastern Europe in the late 19th century and early 20th century brought the District's Jewish population to 4,000. Overall, the new immigrants, a large portion of whom came from Russia, were poor. The D.C. Jewish community set up multiple charity organizations in response, including a Hebrew Free Loan Society, the Hebrew Relief Society, and a Jewish Foster Home. Other community organizations founded around this time included the Hebrew Home for the Aged, the D.C chapter of the National Council of Jewish Women, and a Young Men's Hebrew Association (YMHA) and Young Women's Hebrew Association (YWHA). Minnie Lansburgh Goldsmith, daughter of the Lansburgh's co-founder Gustav Lansburgh, was at the heart of charitable giving and community organizing in this time and throughout her life.  20th century  Protest on the National Mall in support of Soviet Jews in 1973. When World War I brought a wave of servicemen and government workers to the District, the Jewish community organized programs like dances and social events, often run by the YMHA and YWHA. These activities were part of the impetus for the creation of the Jewish Community Center in 1926, situated a mile from the White House on 16th Street. In 1930, the National Jewish Ledger, which later changed its name to Washington Jewish Week, began publishing. In 1938 the Jewish Community Council was formed, creating a centralized organization tasked with advocating for all the Jewish communal organizations in the District. Zionist organizations also set up chapters in the city, such as the Washington Zionist Organization, a chapter of the Zionist Organization of America, and the Washington Poale Zion Society. Following a visit to D.C. by its founder, Henrietta Szold, a chapter of Hadassah was established in 1919. During the period of the Great Depression, the Jewish community once again rapidly expanded, more than doubling in size. Jews from all over the country came to the District to work on New Deal projects, or in the growing civil service. The Hebrew Sheltering Society, and numerous social service organizations, helped to provide kosher food, distribute clothing, and obtain housing for new arrivals D.C. still looking for work. Also in this time, the Jewish community began to spread out to suburbs in Maryland and neighborhoods in the north of D.C. Moving north, however, was somewhat restricted by the presence of covenants in some real estate deeds that prohibited leasing or selling the property to Jews, African Americans, and other groups in places like Spring Valley and portions of Chevy Chase, Maryland. Such covenants were later ruled unenforceable by law by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1948 in Shelley v. Kraemer. In the 1930s, as it became increasingly dangerous for the Jews in Europe, the Washington Jewish community was especially active in trying to aid rescue efforts. The community signed petitions and demonstrated to try and pressure the British government to allow Jews to immigrate to Mandatory Palestine, including fulling DAR Constitution Hall with 4,000 protesters in 1938. The first Jewish U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Louis Brandeis, hosted a salon with local and national Zionist leaders at his apartment and was active in the Zionist movement. During World War II, the community assisted Jewish newcomers arriving to work for the government or serve in the military. In 1941, JCC was responsible for finding housing for 4,000 Jews who moved to the area. The community's organizations also stepped up to provide social, cultural, and religious programs for members of the armed forces. In 1944 the Hebrew Academy opened, the first Jewish day school in the area. After the war, many prominent members of the area's Jewish community helped to secretly raise funds for illegal immigration to Mandatory Palestine, as well as the Haganah. After the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, local Jews purchased the first embassy for the newly formed state near Embassy Row. The Jewish population of the area went from 20,000 in 1945 to 81,000 in 1956, half of whom were living in the suburbs and not the District itself. The population reached 110,000 in 1970. With the expanse into the suburbs also came new synagogues, and Jewish organizations that had been in the city also moved to more suburban areas including the JCC, the Jewish Social Services Agency, the Hebrew Home for the Aged, and eventually the United Jewish Appeal (UJA) and the Jewish Community Council relocated to a centralized campus in Rockville. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Jewish community was active in the Civil Rights Movement, and the Jewish Community Council, now known as the Jewish Community Relations Council, which made its support formally known in the Thompson's restaurant case in 1953. After the Brown v. Board of Education decision, the Council also worked with city and religious leaders to promote a peaceful transition to integration. In 1966, progressive young Jewish intellectuals founded Jews for Urban Justice (JUJ), a left-wing organization founded to oppose anti-black racism within the Jewish community of Washington, D.C. JUJ campaigned against anti-black discrimination from Jewish institutions, fought for equal access to housing at a time when prominent Jewish land developers in the Washington metropolitan area used racially restrictive covenants designed to exclude African-Americans from home ownership, and organized the first Freedom Seder to encourage solidarity between African-Americans and Jewish Americans. In the 1970s and 1980s, many in the community dedicated themselves to the plight of Jews in the Soviet Union who were forced to suppress their Jewishness, as well as for refuseniks, who were denied permission to leave and emigrate to Israel. They participated in large scale marches on the National Mall, and maintained a daily vigil outside of the Soviet Embassy, with the help of church groups that took over on Shabbat and Jewish holidays. When the Jewish population in the District began to grow again, the original JCC building near the White House was repurchased, restored, and then reopened during the 1990s. In 1997 there were 165,000 Jews living in Greater Washington. There has also been an effort to preserve D.C.‚Äôs Jewish history, including its early downtown synagogues, and the Jewish Historical Society of Greater Washington opened and maintains the Lillian & Albert Small Jewish Museum.  Today  U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum Washington, D.C. is also the location of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the official institution for the documentation, study, and interpretation of Holocaust history, as well as serving as the nation's memorial. It was chartered unanimously by Congress following the recommendation of the president's commission on the Holocaust under President Jimmy Carter and opened adjacent to the National Mall in 1993. The National Museum of American Jewish Military History, founded in 1958, was also charted by an act of Congress and documents the contributions of American Jewish servicemembers. Admission to both museums is free. Today, the community is considered to be the third largest Jewish community by metropolitan area in the United States. , it was estimated that 300,000 Jews live in the Washington metropolitan area, of which 28,000 live in the district itself. This is a significant increase from 2003, when the population was 215,000. See also *History of the Jews in Baltimore *History of the Jews in Maryland  References  Washington, D.C.

These include three weekly papers delivered each Thursday: Heartland News, delivered in the towns of Nappanee,Wakarusa, Bremen, Bourbon; Culver Citizen in the town of Culver; and The Leader throughout Starke County. There are also two shopper products: The Shopper, delivered Saturday/Sunday throughout Marshall County; and The Review, delivered Tuesday throughout Starke County. The Valparaiso Vidette MessengerValparaiso Vidette Messenger and the Rushville Republican published stories on The Pilot News 100th birthday on July 31, 1951, detailing how it was one of only twelve daily newspapers in Indiana when it was first established. The Pilot was founded in 1851 by John Q. Howell. It had the odd quirk of publishing its first issue as number 13, which was explained by Howell as an effort to retain continuity of numbering with his previous paper, the Rochester Republican. The Pilot announced its politics as Jacksonian, but pledged to \\"never descend to that abuse of our opponents in Opinion which is too often resorted to by partizan Presses.\\" Howell moved his paper form Rochester to Plymouth when some townspeople in Plymouth offered him $200 to relocate. The Pilot has since gone through multiple owners and many different names, and ultimately switched from being a Democratic paper to a Republican one. It returned to its original name after the merger of the Plymouth Pilot and the Plymouth News in 1947. Under a unique arrangement, the Republican Pilot initially published a copy under the News name and masthead with all the articles the same, but the editorial content from a Democratic perspective. The paper was sold to Park Newspapers in March 1977. In 2003, Horizon Publications purchased it from Community Newspaper Holdings. It had a location sales volume of $1,702,000 as of September 2018.

Written by frontman Al Jourgensen, produced by Adrian Sherwood, and released in November 1985 as a 12-inch single, it was the band‚Äôs first recording after signing with Sire Records; the accompanying music video was directed by Peter Christopherson.  Composition  \\"Over the Shoulder\\" has been described as an early example of electro- industrial, as well as synth-pop and synthrock. On Twitch, it is the fifth track with a length of five minutes and thirteen seconds; the single version is six minutes and forty-four seconds long. Musically, the song contains multiple layers of looped synthesizer parts along with distinctive heavy drum machine pattern and Jourgensen's weak vocal appoarch; Billboard editors compared this approach with music of Scritti Politti and Bee Gees, while Miami New Times' Jean Carey wrote that the song \\"sounds like a giant mosquito.\\" In a later review for the March 1986 issue of Spin Magazine, columnist John Leland praised Sherwood's work with Ministry's ‚Äútypically banal ideas.‚Äù The single version of \\"Over the Shoulder\\" and \\"Isle of Man\\" were included as additional tracks on compact disc edition of Twitch in 1990; the song was also to be featured on a 2001 compilation album Greatest Fits, but was left off due to medium limitations.  Music video  The music video for \\"Over the Shoulder\\" was directed by Peter Christopherson. It consists of footage of two teenagers stealing a car, trashing a grocery store, making a nails-and-gasoline omelet, and driving off with no apparent consequence. According to Jourgensen, the director hired two kids to perform actions featured in the video. When the band asked to film in a store, the owner refused. The director allegedly paid the same kids to break into the store and trash it, and the band asked once again. The owner, needing money to pay for cleanup, agreed. As Jourgensen put it, \\"Everything that happened on that video was criminal.\\" In 2000, the video of ‚ÄúOver the Shoulder‚Äù was featured on compilation album Tapes of Wrath.

The satellite was built during Kyushu Institute of Technology's Birds-2 program. The Birds program helps countries fly their first satellite. BHUTAN-1 was launched into orbit aboard the SpaceX CRS-15 mission on 29 June 2018. It was deployed from the Kib≈ç module of the International Space Station (ISS) on 10 August 2018. The satellite has cameras to image the Earth.  Background  The Kyushu Institute of Technology (KIT) in Japan supports non-spacefaring countries to build their first satellite through a program called the Joint Global Multi-Nations Birds Satellite project (Birds). Five countries participated in the first Birds program (Birds-1). In 2016, Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay mentioned plans to set up a space agency with Bhutan's Information and Communications Ministry. According to Tobgay, plans to launch the first Bhutanese satellite to space came from Bhutanese King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. Three satellites were developed during the Birds-2 program: BHUTAN-1 (Bhutan), UiTMSAT-1 (Malaysia) and Maya-1 (Philippines). BHUTAN-1 was designed by Bhutanese graduate students who were pursuing their master's degree at Kyutech (Kyushu Institute of Technology). The satellite was developed under the Kyushu Institute of Technology-led second Joint Global Multi-nations Birds Satellite (Birds-2).  Development  The Birds-2 project commenced in November 2016. BHUTAN-1 is classified as a 1U CubeSat and measures 10 √ó 10 √ó 11.35 cm and weighs . The satellite was developed and designed by a team of four Bhutanese engineers. The satellite is part of their master's degree in space engineering at Kyushu Institute of Technology. The designing and testing of BHUTAN-1 began by March 2017. The functions of each sub-system of the satellite was verified before the first engineering model of BHUTAN-1 was built in June of the same year. By October 2017, the second engineering model was completed and the development of the flight module commenced.  Mission   Launch  Birds-2 in the JEM Small Satellite Orbital Deployer. Birds-2 satellites deployed from the Kib≈ç module. BHUTAN-1 was launched to space on 29 June 2018, via the Falcon 9 Full Thrust rocket at Cape Canaveral in Florida, as part of the SpaceX CRS-15 Commercial Resupply Service mission. Maya-1 and UiTMSAT-1 which were also developed under the Birds-2 project was also among the payload of the rocket. BHUTAN-1 was deployed from Kib≈ç module of the International Space Station (ISS) in August 2018, becoming the first Bhutanese satellite.  Operations  The satellite operates at an altitude of and passes over Bhutan for three to four minutes four to five times per day. Its designed lifespan is six to nine months, though reportedly it can last up to two years. BHUTAN-1's two cameras capture satellite imagery of Bhutan to help assess the country's glaciers, lakes, and forest cover. It also provides basic communication services and is used to study radiation effects on satellites. While BHUTAN-1 was built solely by the Bhutanese, the satellite is jointly controlled and operated by the Bhutan, Malaysia, and the Philippines. BHUTAN-1 is tracked from the ground station operated by the Information and Communications Ministry of Bhutan.

He was a member of the Cape Colony delegation to the National Convention between 1908 and 1909, which led to the creation of the Union of South Africa, and held various memberships of medical-professional and scholarly bodies in South Africa and the British realm. He was an early occupier of the office of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in South Africa. Beck was knighted in 1911 for his participation in the National Convention.  Personal life and education  Beck was born in Worcester in the Cape Colony to Cornelius Beck, an auctioneer and general agent, and Johanna Elisabeth Meiring on 28 November 1855. He attend school at the South African College and went on to study at the University of the Cape of Good Hope, where he graduated in 1874. He studied medicine in Edinburgh, Scotland, and graduated with first-class honours with a Bachelor of Medicine and a Master in Surgery. In 1880, he was admitted as a member of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh and appointed as a house surgeon and physician at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh for two years. During this time, Beck also studied at hospitals in Berlin and Vienna. He was awarded a Doctor of Medicine in absentia by the University of Edinburgh in 1890, and became a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh the next year. Beck married Emily Mary Kuys in 1885. The couple had three daughters. He died in Cape Town on 15 May 1919, at the age of 63.  Medical practice  Beck was licensed to practice medicine in the Cape Colony in April 1881, practicing first in Kimberley and then in his hometown of Worcester, joining the practice of John Cloete. In September 1882, Beck was elected to the South African Philosophical Society, which would later become the Royal Society of South Africa, and remained a member for life. He was also a regular contributor to the then-South African Medical Journal. He was appointed as Worcester district surgeon in 1883, but moved to Rondebosch near Cape Town in 1886, where he would remain for 20 years, becoming an additional district surgeon. He played a leading role in establishing the Rondebosch Cottage Hospital. Beck was elected a member of the University of the Cape of Good Hope's council and served from 1886 to 1916, and served on the Cape Colonial Medical Council (today, the Health Professions Council of South Africa) between 1892 and 1903. He became President of the Cape Town branch of the British Medical Association in 1894. In 1903, he became a member of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science, of which he remained a part until at least 1906.  Political career  In 1898 or 1899, a bill initially sponsored by Sir Gordon Sprigg, but now championed by Prime Minister William Philip Schreiner, enlarged the Cape House of Assembly by 15 members, one seat of which represented the constituency of Worcester. Beck won this seat right at the outset of the Second Boer War, and despite his sympathies with the Boer republics, remained loyal to the Cape and Britain. In the immediate aftermath of the war, Beck was responsible for the treatment of the former State President of the Orange Free State, Martinus Theunis Steyn, who would later also be a delegate at the National Convention. He retired from his medical practice in 1903 and moved to Tulbagh. Beck once joined John Xavier Merriman, Jan Christiaan Smuts and James Barry Munnik Hertzog on a trek to visit Robertson. He was also close friends with Louis Botha, who would become the first Prime Minister of South Africa. After the Union of South Africa was established, Beck became a member of the Senate for the South African Party. He contested the race for the President of the Senate with Francis William Reitz (another former president of the Orange Free State), with Reitz winning the election after Beck withdrew as a favor to William Philip Schreiner. It was thought that one of the former leaders of the Boer republics should lead the Senate for symbolic and sentimental reasons. Beck later became the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in Louis Botha's second ministry, serving from 1915 to 1919. William Charles Scully wrote that \\"there was an urgent need for the extension of postal, telegraph and telephone facilities,\\" but the Second World War made the necessary material expensive and difficult to obtain.

The Shadow Hearts series was developed by Sacnoth (renamed Nautilus for the later games in the series) and released by Aruze in Japan and Midway in North America and Europe. However, Shadow Hearts: From the New World was published by XSEED Games in North America and Ghostlight in Europe. Common gameplay elements All three Shadow Hearts games are turn-based RPGs. There are two unique elements to the Shadow Hearts games. Judgment Ring For nearly every combat action and for some mini-games, the player is presented with a \\"Judgment Ring\\". This is shown as a circular field that has a radar-like line that sweeps through the circle a single time. There are several colored areas on this field. To successfully complete an action, the player must hit a button as the line passes through the area. For direct attacks, there are one or more of these areas, and as long as each area is hit properly, the player can attempt to make multiple attacks within the same turn. For most offensive and some defense spells, there are areas that must be hit before a last larger area to successfully complete the spell. Most other actions have just one single area to be hit. For attacks, offensive and healing spells, there is also a narrow red area at the end of some sections; if this area is hit, then the attack, spell or item benefit is slightly increased; however, it is possible to miss these areas easily and fail the movement. There are generally a number of ways the ring can be altered willing and unwilling in the games. Special items or persons can widen the size of the marked areas to decrease the chance of missing the mark, or even add a new zone for an additional attack. Equipable items may alter how the Ring behaves, trading off with another statistic; for example, one may be able to increase a character's speed in battle (attacking more often) at the cost of having the Ring sweep faster. Monsters may inflict Ring status changes, such as increasing the sweep speed or reducing the visible size of the ring, which can be cured through spells, items, or restored after the battle is completed. Some gamers complained about the Judgment Ring after the first game, claiming it made the game too hard. To appease them, the second and third games have the option to turn the ring off completely. As a trade-off, doing this prevents the player from performing critical hits, strikes, and other special effects, essentially creating a large handicap in exchange for the reduced difficulty. Sanity Points In addition to the usual Hit Points and Mana Points for each character, there are also Sanity Points (SP), which decrease every turn the character is in battle (as a representation of the character's exposure to the horrific and maddening creatures) or can also be drained by enemies. When a character reaches zero Sanity Points, that character becomes \\"Berserk\\"; the character will perform random actions on random battle participants (including the player's party) with increased bonuses until either some Sanity Points are restored or the battle ends; if the latter occurs, all players, regardless of the Berserk condition, will completely recover their Sanity Points. As with Hit Points and Mana Points, there are ways to restore Sanity Points in battle. Valentine Family In every game there has been at least one member of the Valentine family present as a playable character. The Valentines are a family of vampires, but their appearance strays from the typical Dracula-inspired traits of being dark-haired and pale-skinned; instead, they are blond, blue- eyed, and fair-skinned with no problem being in the sun (or any of the typical vampiric weaknesses). Games Koudelka The PlayStation game Koudelka, Sacnoth's first effort, is technically a predecessor to Shadow Hearts, although the connection to it is not as strong as the connection between the other games. Some of the events that happen in Koudelka are mentioned in Shadow Hearts, and some elements (including characters) from Koudelka also come back in Shadow Hearts.https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/12/14/remembering- shadow-hearts.aspx Shadow Hearts Shadow Hearts takes place ten years after Koudelka, 1913, in the same universe. On a branch of the Trans-Siberian Railroad in Manchuria, the game's protagonist, Yuri Volte Hyuga (Urumof \\"Uru\\" Bort Hyuga in the Japanese version), hears a voice in his head telling him to rescue the young Alice Elliot, whose priest father was recently murdered in a most brutal fashion in Rouen, France. After an English gentleman by the name of philosopher Roger Bacon attempts to abduct Alice from the Japanese army himself, Yuri saves her, and starts a quest through China (and eventually Europe) to discover Alice's importance, Bacon's intent, the identity of the mysterious voice, and his own relevance. Shadow Hearts: Covenant Shadow Hearts: Covenant (also called Shadow Hearts II) directly continues from the story at the end of Shadow Hearts, assuming the \\"bad ending\\" was correct. This game features 2 DVD ROM discs instead of the usual 1, which provides (according to the publisher) 40 hours of gameplay. The town of Domremy has stubbornly refused to fall to the German advance at the beginning of World War I thanks to the aid of a \\"demon\\" which seems to defend it. Lieutenant Karin Koenig of the German Army is sent along with a person who claims to be an Inquisitor from the Vatican, Nicolai Conrad, to acquire a means of exorcising this demon. However, the \\"Demon of Domremy\\" is actually the Harmonixer Yuri from the first Shadow Hearts. Yuri, Karin, and Nicolai soon become entangled in a plot involving secret conspiracies, the Russian royal family, the Japanese foreign minister, the mystical tome from Koudelka, and more. The game as a whole was revamped from Shadow Hearts, including the graphics, cutscenes, voices, the way the Judgment Ring worked,https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2012/12/14/remembering- shadow-hearts.aspx and the cast of characters, with several from the original game recurring in cameo roles. Game critics have also smiled upon Shadow Hearts: Covenant much more than the original, and a general consensus seems to be that the game is an overall improvement on the first. Shadow Hearts: From the New World This game begins in North America in the year 1929 and features two new main characters: a 16-year-old New Yorker named Johnny Garland, and a 21-year-old Native American woman named Shania. Shania has powers of fusion similar to Yuri and Kurando in the previous Shadow Hearts entries, but Shania is not a Harmonixer. Instead, she makes pacts with spirits, in direct contrast to Yuri and Kurando who turned into demons. The story begins with Johnny, a private detective, being hired by a man named Gilbert to find one named Marlow Brown. When Johnny finds the man, however, a mysterious \\"window\\" opens, and from it emerges a Lovecraftian monster. The rest of the game follows Johnny, Shania, and company as they attempt to uncover the truth about Gilbert and his plans. Whether or not From The New World is closer to a spin-off or a sequel, the game has several links with the previous game. Beside a few returning characters (Roger Bacon, Lenny Curtis, Joachim Valentine, Keith Valentine (as the Silver Bat), Hildegarde Valentine (as the Peach Bat in Shadow Hearts: Covenant, here as a playable character in Johnny's party) and Gerard (the shopkeeper) as well as items (√âmigr√© Manuscript), and important events that took place in Shadow Hearts II are mentioned, such as Nicolai (Nicholas) Conrad's release of Malice.

AirDrop is the primary medium for cyber-flashing. Cyber flashing is a crime which involves sending obscene pictures to strangers through AirDrop. The term can also apply to the same action carried out entirely through Bluetooth. Initial usage The mainstream initial usage of the term occurred around 13 August 2015, after a female commuter was AirDropped two pictures of a penis. The case was reported to the British Transport Police who indicated that as the pictures were declined insufficient data was recorded by the receiving phone to provide suitable evidence. Methodology and prevention AirDrop is a hybrid communication method of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. Bluetooth passes communication via use of UHF radio waves. AirDrop seeks out potential communication partners by use of Bluetooth and then uses it to establish a secure peer-to-peer \\"Wi-Fi channel\\" over which the actual information is passed - usually photographs, documents, and videos. An appropriately equipped device can seek out any active peers within about 10 metres. The harassing individual can make an initial connection with any device that is open to all users. A photo can then be sent with a preview of the photo being shown to the device's owner at the same time as a request to allow connection. Therefore the harassment (the \\"flashing\\") can occur before a specific connection is authorised. Prevention requires reverting to the iPhone's default conditions - either turn AirDrop off or set it only to allow connections with contacts. Police forces have suggested pushing AirDrop to program an automatic reversion to this condition after a set time of configured open access. If harassing photographs are received then keeping them allows the victim to provide a much greater set of information to cyber crime units with the police. This does cause the issue that the most effective methods of catching the cyber-flashers risks causing additional harassment and pain to the victims. Additional incidents Frequency of the crime has been difficult to assess with significantly stronger anecdotal evidence than indicated by crime figures. On August 13, 2017, the New York Post reported that at least two women were sent nude pictures while commuting. A HuffPost reporter in the UK was also sent more than 100 sexual pictures while commuting. This case was reported to the British Transport Police and when these news stories were published a number of women indicated to the publications that they had suffered similar harassment. However, UK police forces indicates very few complaints for these actions despite \\"a growing awareness\\" of it occurring. This indicates a wide-level of under-reporting and thus few arrests and prosecutions. In Australia, May 2018, it was reported that cyber-flashing was increasingly common as a prank used by children, popular due to its ease in targeting multiple individuals very rapidly in a fairly unidentifiable fashion. Legal issues As with other technological- based abuses, such as Deepfake pornography, revenge porn, and upskirting, there was no specific pre-existing law designed to criminalise and prevent cyber-flashing. This means that many police forces were and are required to fallback on more generalised crimes such as harassment and outraging public decency. In New South Wales, Australia, The Crimes Amendment (Intimate Images) Bill 2017 was implemented to make it an offence to \\"intentionally record or distribute, or threaten to record or distribute, an intimate image of a person without their consent\\". This legislation would cover cyber-flashing by its prohibition on distributing intimate images without consent. In the UK there has been criticism that \\"upskirting laws\\" under consideration would not cover cyber-flashing, as well as other forms of image-based abuse, such as revenge porn. The proposed laws also have a stronger intent prohibition, and it is unclear whether it would cover non-harassment circumstances as well as issues where the receiver of the images has not consented but the \\"image subject\\" has. In Singapore, cyber flashing, upskirt photography, and revenge porn has been criminalized since May 2019.

It was the largest and most devastating fire in Key West history. The fire began in a coffee shop next to the San Carlos Institute. It burned for 12 hours over 50 acres, destroyed most of the commercial area of the city, killed seven people, injured 15 more, and cost one and a half million dollars in property damage.  Compounding factors  There were several compounding factors that caused the fire to burn for so long and destroy so much of the city. Since 1875, the city had a serious fire department, organized first by A. H. Dorsett. However, at the time of the fire, the city's only steam fire engine had been sent to New York for repair. Firefighters were only able to use less effective measures like hand pumpers. Secondly, on the night when the fire occurred, strong winds were blowing, which caused the fire to start up again even where it appeared to have been put out.  Arson speculation  There is speculation that the fire was started on purpose by arsonists sent by the Spanish empire attempting to undermine Key West citizens' support for Cuban independence. This stems from three key details of the fire. The fire was started immediately next to the San Carlos Institute, which was the heart of Cuban culture in Key West. The economic prosperity that Cuban emigrants found in Key West was the source of direct financial contributions to the Cuban revolution. Secondly, the morning after the fire, there was a Spanish ram waiting to take on any unemployed Cuban cigar workers who wanted to return to Cuba. 400 workers returned at that time. Thirdly, Havana newspapers reportedly ran an article describing the great fire the day before it actually took place.  Buildings destroyed  Notable buildings destroyed by the great fire include the San Carlos Institute, City Hall, St. Paul's Church, Fire House No. 1, the Fogarty Mansion, the Patterson House, and the Key West Custom House. Because the blaze occurred in the heart of the island's business district, many cigar factories and sponge warehouses burned down, putting four thousand employees out of work.  Aftermath  William Curry was chairman of the Relief Committee created to rebuild the city after the fire. On April 4, he publicly requested aid from US Citizens: \\"A large portion of our city having been swept away by the flames, our industrial occupations entirely ruined, and thousands of our people left in other destitution and distress, we found ourselves compelled to appeal to the benevolence of our country...\\" The local fire department took measures to better prepare for such a massive fire in the future. They purchased two new steam engines, rebuilt the firehouse, and built several new firehouses across town over the next several years. Within two years, the city had a waterworks system to bring in salt water in case of fire. The city also became home to a privately owned telegraph fire alarm system. Buildings reconstructed after the fire often used wood, which is unusual for communities that have experienced such a massive fire event. The motivations for this appear to be economic: lumber was readily available in Key West due to the wrecking business. The wood used most often in wealthy homes was Dade County pine, which had high resistance to termites. However, many buildings destroyed in the fire (such as Fire House No. 1) were rebuilt with red brick.

It is located at 227 Duval Street and is denoted by Key West Historic Marker 18.  History   Construction  The home was first built in 1875 by Charles Curry. This original structure was destroyed in the 1886 fire in Key West, and was rebuilt as the current structure in 1887. Charles Curry was the son of William Curry, and the home is typical of the mansions built by Curry children, such as the Southernmost Mansion built by Florida Curry.  Namesake  After Charles‚Äô death, the house was purchased for his daughter Corinne by her husband Dr. Joseph Norman Fogarty as a wedding present in 1900. Dr. Fogarty, for whom the house is now known, was mayor of Key West when the Overseas Railroad linked the island to the Florida mainland for the first time in 1912. He held office for six years. He was a prominent and wealthy member of the Key West community who used his property to host a number of important events. In January 1912, he held a large reception for Henry Flagler to celebrate the completion of Flagler‚Äôs Overseas Railroad. In December of that year, he held a reception for William Howard Taft, who stopped in Key West on his way to inspect the Panama Canal. Grover Cleveland was also entertained at the Fogarty house.  Current Usage  After the Fogartys passed, the house fell into disrepair. In 1971, it was purchased by John and Dolly Dedek, who turned it into the Fogarty House 1875 Restaurant. Today, the house is the site of Fogarty‚Äôs Restaurant and Flying Monkeys Saloon. The Flying Monkeys Saloon is the site of an original piece by late Key West artist Captain Outrageous.

The attack resulted in the death of a 13-year-old girl and injuries to 12 people. Attack The driver was in a BMW vehicle and smashed into the terrace of Cesena Pizzeria, where there were 20 people dining. The driver then tried to reverse, but was stopped. The gendarmes soon arrived at the scene and arrested the driver. Suspect and investigation The suspect was later identified as 32-year-old David Patterson, a psychologically unstable and suicidal man thought to have links to the United Kingdom but a French national. He was not known to the police and acted alone, and the attack was not terror related. Patterson lived with his parents in La Fert√©-sous-Jouarre and was thought to have been a cannabis smoker since the age of nine. French President Emmanuel Macron sent his condolences to the victims via Twitter. The attack came just five days after another car ramming attack in Paris that injured six people (see Levallois-Perret attack).
